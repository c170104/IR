Just days before the beginning of the NBA season, the Nerdlucks land in the cartoon universe to demand a rematch with the Looney Tunes. They believed it was unfair the first time around since the Toons had help from the best player of all time. All of the Tunes wanted nothing to do with the rotten aliens because they knew how evil and deceptive they really were, even though they looked like pipsqueaks. However, Bugs Bunny, being the cocky rabbit he is, accepted the challenge since they had won the last time. What he didn't know was that they had already stolen the powers of the best basketball players in the league. They raided basketball games in the preseason and drained the powers of Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Durant. Everyone wondered how these All Stars could all of the sudden go from dropping 30 points a game to barely being able to dribble the ball. But the Nerdlucks didn't care, now they could transform into the Monstars again and were ready to annihilate Bugs and the Tune Squad. Bugs realized he made a mistake, and this time they couldn't count on the help of Michael Jordan since he is 53 and much too old to play. Daffy Duck thought all hope was lost, as did the rest of the Tunes. They thought the Monstars would surely prevail this time around and enslave them as an amusement park attraction on their planet. However, just because Jordan couldn't play as well anymore, didn't mean he couldn't help his friends. \" I'll tell you what,\" Mike said, \" I can't really help you on the court, but I've always wanted to coach. AND I also have connections to some great young players.\" \"That's great Doc!\" Bugs exclaimed. \"Ehhh, just one tiny problem …. NOBODY WILL EVER BE AS GOOD AS YOU.\" Mike couldn't help but laugh because even though he was flattered and knew it was probably true, he thought the rabbit underestimated today's players. Although nobody could ever replace him as the G.O.A.T, he had only one person in mind to fill in for him; Lebron James. Lebron was probably the closest thing to Michael in basketball, besides Kobe Bryant of course. But Kobe had just retired the season prior, while Lebron was coming off a championship season with a ring and a finals MVP trophy. Mike was impressed by Lebron's dominance on the court because it reminded him of himself the way he put his heart into every game. He also admired how James was chasing his legacy, although it would be a tough mission to be compared to the greatest of all time.

It was a beautiful evening in the Mon stars house and the teams were wearing tuxedos while throwing a anniversary party at their place to celebrate the day when they first became the Mon stars. Bob their number #1 fan,Chauncey, Stewart, Mildred, and all of their friends danced to music from the boom box in their living room; some of them were chilling eating cake, snacks, drinking punch and talking to each was on the couch flirting with a bunch of girls, Blank o showed his cool yet goofy dance moves, Pound and Bang were thumb wrestling, and Nawt was stuffing his face with barbecue wings, and chili dogs. Everybody was having a great time at the party. Ten hours had passed and it was getting late. All their friends and neighbors left the house and Pound closed the front door shut. The boys sat on the couch exhausted after they cleaned up the house. \"Man, what a party.\" Blanko groaned. \"Tell me about it.\" Nawt agreed. Bupkus sighed, \"It was a night to remember.\" The purple Monstar blushed and stared at the hearts circling around him long after he was kissed by a crowd of women. \"Alright Casanova, chill out!\" Pound retorted. Bupkus snapped out of it and glared at Pound. \"The important thing is that we had a great anniversary party.\" said Blanko. \"Yeah, I can't believe it's been 21 years since we became big and strong.\" Bang realized. \"And handsome too.\" Bupkus added. \"But the one thing I'm happy about is that we get to play basketball, do whatever we want and have our own place to live.\" \"You know, living with you guys has been the best days of my life and even though I can be bossy and uptight sometimes, I really care about you all and the truth is, you guys are my best friends and I love you guys.\" Pound said after wiping a tear. The boys smiled at what Pound said. Blanko walks towards Pound and placed his hand on his shoulder. \"We love you too Pound and that's the nicest thing you ever said to us.\" \"Pound, we just want to say we're grateful to have a leader like you.\" said Bang. Pound was teary-eyed after hearing how much his friends appreciate him for being their leader. He held his arms out for a group hug, \"Oh come here you knuckleheads.\" He sobbed happily. The Monstars gave each other heartwarming groups hug. The gang got off the couch and started yawning. \"Alright everyone let's head upstairs, get out of our tuxes, and into bed.\" Pound told them. The Monstars went upstairs in their own rooms, got undressed and went to bed saying goodnight to each other as they went to sleep. For the Monstars, it was truly a Happy Anniversary.

Was it easy for a mouse to play basketball? Not at all. In fact, it was rather complicated. There were rodents of considerable size out there but as for Speedy and Sniffles, that was a problem. They couldn't handle a ball so much bigger than they were; bounces and their partners playing without minding their step were a threat to their integrity. However, Speedy was convinced that he had handled the situation very well. Señor Jordan was reluctant to let him play but he showed him that he was a decent player, even if he had never played that sport before. Speedy trained hard for weeks until he was able to bounce and handle that ball, gigantic from his perspective. He was quite strong for mouse standards. Though unable to throw the ball into the basket, he showed the superstar that he could also be a valuable member for the team. He couldn't do much, but running was his biggest asset. Same for Roadrunner. Two days before the match, during the trainings, Jordan had a small conversation with the two of them and designed a plan which required speed and thinking fast. They were just perfect for that task. Sat on the bench, next to Granny, Speedy was surprised to find that he wasn't nervous. Behind him, all the town cheered. They were all there, with no doubt. Small and big, popular and obscure, all folks from Warner wanted to see the match. That match in which they were risking so much. He turned around to look for his kinfolk. His eyes met his cousin Slowpoke and waved his hand to him, but Slowpoke didn't seem to notice, because he kept looking into space–he did notice, but took him almost a minute to respond, and by then Speedy had forgotten about it. Somewhere in the stands were his girls, eager to see him play. But for the moment Jordan didn't require his services. They seemed to do well. Uh…Not exactly well, actually. Just a couple of minutes and the Monstars already had a considerable advantage. As minutes passed, that difference became overwhelming. No wonder the team went to the showers looking so grim; even Speedy felt it was probable that they couldn't win this one after all. It had to be the first time the Looney Tunes couldn't escape unscathed from one menace. If only Jordan gave him the chance to try! His prayers seemed to take effect. After the intermission Jordan required toons who hadn't played yet and Speedy and Roadrunner finally moved into action. Speedy's heart beat with such intensity it almost seemed it was going to explode. He heard the mouse public applaud. Oh, the adrenaline! He was sure the audience would remember their game for years. As soon as Marvin blew the whistle, Roadrunner grabbed the ball and, with a \"beep beep\" darted towards the rival basket. Cheering, Speedy followed. The only thing those brutes probably saw was a lightning. Since the path was blocked, Roadrunner stopped and passed the ball to Speedy delicately. When that stupid Blanko wanted to react, the ball was in Speedy's hands and he was heading to his objective, right under his own legs. The blue Monstar tried to stop him but when he was bending his knees, the mouse had already vanished. His partners shouted, telling him to stop the blue bird, and it was useless too: before his damaged brain could interpret the orders, he was gone. The Monstars could do nothing to stop them. Speedy passed the ball to Roadrunner and he jumped gracefully, threw it into the basket. The stadium roared. The two fast toons celebrated it with a quick hug, for there was no time to loose. But Speedy could hear the people admire their speed. It would be too easy from now on. Oh, but unfortunately, he didn't hear what the Monstars were plotting. He found out when it was too late, after three more scores. Pound, that big, nasty thing, had waited patiently, in a place which was not casual. All of his partners had learned fast. They made Roadrunner run in zig-zag, until he inevitably met Pound. He was waiting with his hand open. He closed it all of a sudden, trapping the bird's neck. Nawt stole the ball, while Pound squeezed the Roadrunner; Speedy saw an expression of shock and suffocation in his face. Then, Pound lifted him in the air and smashed him against the court, like some crazy rock stars did to their poor guitars. The audience exclaimed and Speedy was petrified for a second. His friend's neck looked like an accordion, and his tongue stuck out. The medics quickly took him out. He saw those beasts laughing. \"¡ Cerdos !\" Speedy was angry now. He may have been small, but he was going to make them pay for that. Oh, they would pay! Jordan was shouting something but he didn't listen. Probably it had nothing to do with him, maybe he was telling him to run before they scored. Anyway, that's what he did: he ran as fast as he could to reach the ball, steal it, and maybe gnaw their ankles on the way. He would have never suspected that those beasts had considered the smallest detail until it was too late. Nawt kept running towards their basket and his partners Bupkus and Bang covered his back. Speedy didn't have time to see what they dropped to the floor. He didn't have the chance to jump or change his direction. All he knew that next there was a snap! and the world stopped. He heard gasps from the audience and his team. He would have sworn a lady from the stands let out a heartbreaking cry, \" ¡SPEEDITO! \". Next…oh, he didn't know. He couldn't move. His vision was blurred. His leg had spasms. He kept enough conscience to hear voices around him without really understanding them, feel a somehow dull pain in his neck and, most of all, bear that harrowing pain. He had failed.

But they were mainly just messing and fooling around, as Michael Jordan watched them. They were supposed to be training for the upcoming big basketball game against the Monstars. But so far, things weren't looking too well. Yosemite Sam shot the ball in the air and it flies, then it hit Daffy Duck in the butt. He falls to the ground. \"Hey!\" He yelled. Wile E. Coyote picked up the ball, then the Roadrunner came along quickly and took it from him. The Roadrunner then crashed through a wall, as Wile E went after him. It appeared like an entrance to the outside of the gym. Wile E went there himself, but instead of going outside, he hit the hole. He then slided up, like blinds. Michael shook his head. ''Has anyone here ever played basketball?'' Then, a girl rabbit came in. ''Umm, I have.\" This is the sexy Lola Bunny, and the Tunes turned around and see her. \"I'd like to try out for the team.'' We hear hot music in the background. She's the heartthrob of the hoops, Lola Bunny! Bugs Bunny was interested in this babe, right off the bat. ''Heeeey?'' Lola Bunny goes up to him for a handshake, and smiling. ''Hi, my name is Lola Bunny.'' ''Lola?'' He was shaking her hand firmly. Lola Bunny giggled. ''Yes.'' ''Hello.\" Bugs buffed himself up, to impress her. \"Eh, my name is... BUGS~!'' He accidentally burped when he said his name. Lola giggled again as Bugs cleared his throat. ''You wanna play a little one on one, doll?'' Lola Bunny was offended, as she had fire in her eyes. '' Doll? '' S he asked hotly. Bugs had hearts in his eyes. ''Uh-huh!'' ''On the court... Bugs.' ' Ooh, she's hot. ''Sure!\" He went with her to the center of the gym. Bugs and Lola began playing together. ''Ready?'' She asked him, dribbling the ball. ''Eh, yes.\" He was trying to block her, but she was quick. \"I got it! I got it!'' Before he could get the ball, Lola circled around him, as Bugs winded up in a knot. She dribbled the ball and slam dunks it. The Tunes were all impressed with her skills. ''The girl's got some skills.'' Michael noted. Lola adjusted her shirt, her look very hot. She walked back to Bugs. ''Yessss?'' Bugs asked dreamily. Lola Bunny pulled him to her face, her fingers under his chin. ''Don't ever call me... doll .'' She blew her ears out of her face. ''Check!\" Bugs landed to the floor, like a stiff board. As she was heading for the door, she told Bugs, ''Hey, nice playing with ya.'' The Tunes smiled at her as she left. ''Very smooth.'' Michael told Bugs. ''Ahh, she's obviously nuts about me.'' Bugs told him, still in a dreamily voice. '' Obviously. '' Michael responded sarcastically. After that scene, but before the big game began, Bugs visited Lola at her house. The scenery was very 1990's-ish, and the music playing was Space Jam related music, like smooth R&B.; The music in the background would make a nice vibe to the scene; it has that 1990's feel to it, just like the movie had at times. \"Hey, Lola?\" Bugs asked as he walked in the house. This place only consisted of Lola's room inside, and its space was decent. Her room had a basketball hoop, and she had posters on the walls of sports related stuff. \"Hi, Bugs.\" Lola smiled, her posture sexy as she laid on her bed and was reading a magazine. 'You're killin' me here!' he thought. \"Listen eh...we really need you on our team.\" \"Oh yeah?\" She asked with a hot voice, moving around in her bed and giving Bugs some nice views. \"I uh...\" Bugs couldn't really think straight, or talk for that matter. \"Yeah, I mean...you got great skills, doll.\" He suddenly gulped, realizing that last word he'd said. Lola glared at him from her bed. She got up and lightly pushed him to the floor, standing over him with hands on her hips. \"Don't ever call me... doll. \" \"...Check.\" Bugs just about lost it, having gotten some more nice views! She smirked in satisfaction. After that, Lola said...\"I'll join your team.\" On the night of The Ultimate Game. Lola Bunny was super sexy, and her shadow revealed it as she walked slowly. \"At small forward: standing a scintillating 3 ft. 2, The Heartthrob of the Hoops: Lola Bunny!\" She received a ball from a fan, dribbled and tossed it, and it landed on her finger spinning. The audience hooted, cheered, and even whistled at her. Then, it's Daffy's turn. Hubey then announced, \"At power forward, The Quackster of the Court: Daffy Duck!\" He stepped up and said, \"Thank you! Thank you!\" But the audience remained silent and the only sound being made was cricket chirping. Sarcastically, he said \"Very funny. Let's all laugh at the duck!\" Then, the lights dimmed and the crowd stomped and clapped. \"And at point guard, standing 3 ft. 3, 4 ft. if you include the ears, Co-captain of the Tune Squad, The Doctor of Delight: Bugs Bunny!\" Bugs was underneath the floor of the gym and popped out saying, \"Thank you! Thank you!\" The only ones booing at him were the Nerdlucks, who were watching with Swackhammer. (Later in the game) Lola had the ball and she dribbled it to the hoop, but Pound and Bang get in her way. ''Try to get by me, doll!'' Pound told her, laughing. ''Doll?'' Lola jumped up and ran on Pound's face; Pound reacted in surprise upon seeing her slam dunk. She scored and the Tunes cheered for her. ''Don't ever call me...doll.'' Pound looked at her dumbfounded. Bugs Bunny high-fived Lola. ''Nice shot!'' She smiled in reply, \"Thanks, Bugs.\" They both ran off together. (Later in the game) During a break time, Lola went over to Bugs on the bench. \"Where does it hurt?\" \"Everywhere!\" Bugs moaned. The game had been pretty intense so far. She started touching him, massaging him. He's in heaven. \"Yeah, that's it. There, too. Ooo don't stop.\" He moaned from the massage. (Later in the game) As he was chuckling, Pound climbed up on the basket-hoop. ''This is gonna be fun.'' He jumped off, about to land on Lola! Bugs Bunny tired to warn her. \"Lola, Lola heads up!\" Lola turned around and saw Pound doing a belly flop, as he's about to crush her. ''Belly flop!'' Pound yelled. However, \"Look out!\" Bugs pushed Lola out of the way, and he gets crushed instead. Lola rolled around and felt shocked seeing Bugs crushed by Pound. ''Oh my, Bugs!'' She gasped. The crowd gasped in horror. \"Bugs!\" She cried and went over to him. ''Is this your man?'' Pound smirked and got up to walk away. Bugs was flat and twisting in pain, but then he returns to normal. Lola ran to Bugs, kneeling down to check on him. ''Are you okay?'' She asked in a worried tone. ''Me? Oh, yeah I'm fine. Are you okay?'' Bugs asked her. She smiled in relief that he was alright, and relieved a sigh of contentment. ''Oh Bugs... thank you.'' ''Aww, it was nothin'.'' Bugs smiled softly. Lola took his face in her hands, looking in his eyes. \"That was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.\" She placed her lips on his and kissed him. After a moment, she parted and walked away, leaving Bugs with a dumb grin on his face and had hearts in his eyes. Although she initially turned down Bugs' advances, her feelings shifted to affection after he saved her from a belly-flopping Pound, getting himself painfully squashed in the process (showing that he is willing to put himself in harm's way for her and genuinely cares for her). Acting on these feelings, that's why she kissed him. (When the game finishes) The Tunes win! The crowd cheers wildly! Swackhammer yells in rage, but also in great surprise. The Tunes cheer for their big victory of the game. Bugs and Lola hug each other, Bill Murray laughs joyfully and ran to his friend Michael. The Tunes ran up to each to other and they give each high fives and hugs. Michael and Bill talked in private as the Tunes celebrated their victory. The Monstars blasted Swackhammer to the Moon in a rocket, when Jordan made them realize that they do not have to take his abuse anymore. Jordan then convinced them to give up the stolen talents, and the Looney Tunes agree to recruit the reformed Nerdlucks in their ensemble. Afterwards, Michael had a last talk with the Tunes. ''I really enjoyed playing with you guys. You guys got a lot of, uh..'' ''Huh?'' They all asked together. ''A lot of, uh...\" ''Yeees?'' The Tunes asked again. ''Well, whatever it is, you got a lot of it.'' Michael told them. The Tunes felt happy about what Michael said. ''All right, gotta go. Bugs?'' He turned to Bugs. ''Eh, Mike?'' ''Stay out of trouble.'' Michael told him that, then took off with Bill and Stan (the guy from Jurassic Park). ''You know I will.'' Bugs smiled and turned his attention to Lola. Lola was giggling. \"Don't suppose you still want to go out with me tonight, do you?\" She embraced him. ''...Come here!'' He hugged Lola tightly and kisses her big on the lips. That was indeed her answer. When Michael Jordan left Looney Tune Land, Bugs makes out with Lola Bunny! The Tunes were whistling and applauding like crazy. Bugs and Lola held each other hand as they gave each other repeated kisses for victory. They continued to kiss for awhile! Sharing big, tender, passionate, soft, loving, sweet kisses over and over again! They kissed and smooched repeatedly. Daffy Duck, on the other hand, had different feelings on what he was witnessing. \"You're despicable!\" He said his famous line to Bugs Bunny. After they were finally done, the bunnies exited the set, with Lola holding onto his arm. First with one arm, then with both of them. She smiled sexy-like. Lola became Bugs' girlfriend by this point. ''Lola, my dream. She's crazy about me...sometimes. Just don't call her \"doll\".'' Bugs Bunny told the audience.

While he was sitting their with his head down and a round of gin shots. Tweetie walked up to Bugs Bunny and ask, \" what's up Doc?\" in her soft squeaky voice. Bugs responses in a slur, \"nothing much\". Tweeties says, \"what's got you down?\" Bugs replies, \"I lost everything doc\"! \"Sam has it all\"! Tweetie in a angered voice \"your kidding right\"! \"I almost lost my tavern because of Sam\". Tweetie continues, \"he needs to be taken down already bugs\"! Bugs responds\" what yuh got in mind tweet\". tweetie replies \"i say we get a team together and take it all back bugs\" Bugs raises his head and says \"i don't know tweet it seems too risky\". Tweetie flies up behind the bar and says, \"just think about it bugs, i mean it's only right to take back what's ours\". \"Why don't you go home and think about it bugs\". Bugs responds, okay doc i guess i'll think about it\". Bugs then walk out of tweeties tavern and makes his way home down Mulberry Street. As bugs sits in his home he looks at his bills and tears up thinking about how he's going to pay them. He thought about calling Michael Jordan and asking for some money but was too embarrassed to ask. Bugs then starts thinking about what tweetie wanted to do to get there money back. But he thought to himself, \"it wouldn't hurt to get back my money \"I'm just worried about if it all goes wrong or we get in deep trouble with police\". He sat there contemplating what he should do. Then he got up strong and looked in the mirror with a determined look on his face picked up his phone called tweetie and said \"get a team together, I'm in\". Tweetie responds, \"let's do this\". Tweetie then assembled a team of toons to do the job consisting of Tasmanian devil Aka TAZ whose spin is so powerful it can cut through any safe, cage, and even T.N.T. then there's Marvin the Martian who's known how to use a ray gun for intimidation purposes, and finally Sylvester…. They just needed a fifth man. The next day bugs makes his way to tweeties tavern to meet with the team to plan out the heist and meet oe another before the big job. Bugs walks in and sees everyone sitting around the table talking and takes a seat and says out loud \"what's up doc\"! The room gets quiet and everyone just stops and looks at him. Tweetie then flies in and begins to talk. \"Hello everyone, TAZ, Marvin, bugs. Wait where's Sylvester? Sylvester standing behind tweetie with a fork and a knife says \"right behind you, you delicious piece of chicken\". Tweetie yells, \"sit down Sylvester \"! \"We have business to plan out\"!. They all sat around planning out the heist in detail. Bugs sat there looking scared and confused but he knew it had to be done. They began to gather weapons tweetie had bought to drop on Sylvester if he tried to eat him again. They decided no one gets hurt but Sam if he tries anything. Bugs still sitting there in silence continued to agree. Then tweetie finishes with \"and it all goes down tomorrow\". Everyone turned and shouted \"yeah\" except taz who was more of a \"yabt\". Bug finally makes it back home after the meeting and is up all night thinking about the heist and how many different ways it could go down. Bugs got up out of bed at 5:00am to meet at Sam's casino right before it opens. He tells himself \"I got this\" as he puts on his space jam jersey under his black suit. Bugs then grabbed his bag of carrots and made his way over to meet with the team. The team now all together wearing suits and mustache glasses were in position as they waited till the casino opens at 8. Tweetie flies close to see how many security guards there were and checked the windows throughout the casino. He flew back in a hurry and told the team \"there are about 5 cowboys in there with bats and they are all pretty big too so we need to knock those guys out first\". So they all split up on each window and repelled up. Bugs of course going for the biggest guy of the five cowboys. On three they busted in and knocked out the security cowboys. Marvin showed in a stern voice \"everyone get down or you all will be vaporized\" as he pointed his ray guns at the scared casino goers. Tweetie yells out to Taz, \"breakdown Sam's office door big fella\". He begins to spin while muttering \"blaby blaby baba\"! And breaks down Sams office door. Tweety and bugs side by side run in and Sam slowly turns around in his chair. He looks at the two of them and says \"Dang nabbit you boys done got me there huh\"! Bug then says \"well uh yeah Doc, we need our money back little cowboy\". Tweetie side by side with bugs says \"hand it over Sam there's nothing you can do\". Sam stares at them and smiles and responds \"well their partner that's where you're wrong\"! Two cages drop from the ceiling and traps Bugs and tweety. Sam begins laughing \"ha ha yee haa\"! The two begin calling out for the rest of the team who was outside making sure no one moved. Sam continues to laugh and says \"they can't help you, bring em in boys\". Bugs and tweet look at the door where the cowboys have the whole team on the grounds in rope all tied up. Sam shouts \"you guys will all pay the price now yeeehaaa\". The whole gang looks at each other in disbelief as sam begins to grab his revolvers and walks over to the cages. Sam looks down at the tune gang and says \"you dang nabbits are finished. Sylvester ask sam \"isth it okay if i switch sidesth because i don't care for this thside anywho\". Sam says, \"of course you can partner\" and releases him. Sam then points his two revolvers one at bugs the other at tweety. Then out of nowhere the ceiling window shatters and shotgun shots are fired around the room. BANG! BANG! POW! After the smoke clears out of the room bugs looks up and realizes he didn't get hit. Tweety is okay too. The whole gang is kay and the cage lock are shot off. The gang looks up and standing on sam's desk is elmer fudd holding his hunting shotgun. He looked over and said \"im hunting wabbits, but if anyones going to get you it's going to be me the Wabbit hunter\". \"You get a free one today wabbit\" as bugs scanned the room he saw Sam and all his men shot by elmer. And he saw the safe had been opened too. Bugs says \"well uh thanks doc, would of been nice if you got here a littler earlier\". Elmer walks away as if he paid no mind to bugs comment and says \"see you during wabbit season stupid wabbit. The team quickly began to collect the money and left the scene. The team split the money evenly at tweeties and everyone cashed out at 1 billion toon dollars a piece. Tweety looked at everyone and said \"good job team, but you know what's next, we all need to go our different ways for a while\". Bugs looks at tweetie and smiles, then says, \"it was nice working with you doc, uh thanks \" as he bite down on a carrot. Tweety smiles back and they all leave to start new lives. Taz moved out of Tunesville and moved to Mexico where he began to host bullfighting in his new mansion. Marvin took his money and opened up a space arcade on mars, which turned into a major business and spread across all the planets. Its called marvin's martian arcade and rays. Sylvester ended up sneaking out of the gunfire and bought a farm with only small looking chicken tunes on it. Tweetie bought a bunch of stores for her new cage and seeds selling business which included a bar in every store.

There's one thing that I do like about Bupkus is…his kind nature behind his tough guy facade. I know he's tough, just like the other Monstars, but deep down, he's all fluff. Anyway, this story talks about how Bupkus was feeling strange lately, which he may think that he has a huge…tumor growing inside his stomach for…nine months, but once that ninth month comes, he will see what came out of him that will shock him and may somehow make him feel…soft. However, this is all came from a…dream that I had a couple days ago, you may find it strange, but it just…came into my head when I was sleeping & that it has something to do with my favorite Monstar; Bupkus.

But after that ultimate game that the Looney Tunes, Michael Jordan & the Monstars all had, the Looney Tunes won the game, but after the Monstars discovered that their former boss Mr. Swackhammer had betrayed them & using the Monstars for slavery, the Monstars shoot their former ex-boss now to the Moon, which means that the Monstars deserved their freedom. The biggest part is, they returned the talents back to the five NBA players, but they still got the talent in them, which they are still the Monstars. Anyway, in Looney Tune Land, the Tunes & the Monstars were all playing One-on-One in basketball at the gym. Bang has been drippling the basketball all around and passes the ball over to Bupkus and starts to do a slam-dunk. \"Boo-Ya!\" Bupkus yelled while doing a backwards slam-dunk. Then, Bupkus starts to high-five Bang and Pound at the same time and they just continue on playing until Bupkus starts to feel sweaty in the forehead. \"Phew! I feel hot and sweaty.\" He said while wiping his forehead with a small cool rag in his hand. \"Tell me about it, dude. I know we are just having fun with the Tunes.\" Blanko said while wiping his own forehead as well. \"I hope you can catch up to our score, docs.\" Bugs Bunny said to the other Monstars while crunching on a carrot and grabs the basketball with his ears and passes it to Lola Bunny. \"Thanks, Bugs.\" Lola said with a smile and starts on drippling the basketball. Bupkus smiled and had an idea and he starts on chasing after Lola Bunny and says, \"Let's see what you got, Doll.\" Which somehow Lola Bunny looks up at Bupkus with a \"Not Happy\" look upon her face and says, \"Doll?\" Lola just jumps up, kicks Bupkus in the face a few times, twirls around in the airs and slam-dunks the basketball into the Monstars' basket. After Lola got down, she looks up at Bupkus and flips her ears and say, \"Don't ever call me…doll.\" After the game of One-on-One basketball for the Tunes & the Monstars, Bupkus starts to feel dizzy in his vision. \"Uh, guys? Why is everything spinning around?\" he asked, feeling dizzy. \"Uh…nothing is spinning around, man. Why did you say that?\" Nawt asked. \"I don't know. But…I don't…feel…so…good.\" Bupkus said before he passed out. \"Bupkus?!\" Pound screamed while he and the other Monstars and the Tunes ran over to him to see if he's alright. When they go over to him, they saw Bupkus had his eyes closed, but he wasn't waking up. \"Let's get him back to Monstar Manor. Bugs, go get Witch Hazel and Granny, maybe they could help us on what is wrong with Bupkus.\" Pound said while looking at Bugs and the other Tunes while Bang and Blanko were picking up Bupkus by the arms. \"You got it, doc. We'll meet you back the Monstar Manor.\" Bugs said. And they all went into separate directions, Bugs and the other Tunes went into town to get Witch Hazel from her shop and Granny from her home taking care of Tweety Bird while the Monstars went to get Bupkus to Monstar Manor. Once the Monstars got to Monstar Manor, which is not far from gym and the stadium over the hill, Pound unlocked the front-gate and he also unlocked the front-door and they all went inside. Bang and Blanko with Bupkus still unconscious, they start to take Bupkus up to his bedroom and placed him on his bed and stayed by his side while they wait for Bugs and the other Tunes to return with Witch Hazel and Granny. \"Do you think he's gonna be okay, dude?\" Blanko asked, feeling concern while looking at Bupkus still unconscious. Bang looked at Bupkus and then he looked back at Blanko and says, \"I do not know, Blanko. I really don't know.\" A knock on the door came; Pound answered and saw Bugs with the other Tunes, along with Witch Hazel and Granny with their medical stuff. \"Glad you came, Bugs.\" Pound said. \"Thanks, doc.\" Bugs said with a grin. \"Witch Hazel, Granny. We need your help.\" Nawt said while looking at them. \"What is it, dearie?\" Witch Hazel asked. \"We think something is wrong with Bupkus. We were all playing basketball in the gym, until Bupkus starts to feel dizzy saying that everything is spinning around and then he just…passed out, like that.\" Nawt said while snapping his fingers for a second. \"Oh my goodness! That is not good.\" Granny said, feeling worried. \"Take us up to see Bupkus. We need to see what we can do.\" Witch Hazel said. \"This way.\" Pound said while leading them upstairs to the hallway where they see Bang and Blanko in the hallway next to Bupkus' purple bedroom door. \"How is he doing, guys?\" Pound asked. \"He's still unconscious, Pound. He won't wake up.\" Bang said, feeling worried. \"Don't worry, dearie. We'll see what we can do.\" Granny said and they all head inside Bupkus' purple bedroom. Chapter 2: Wake Up, Morning Sickness Once Witch Hazel and Granny went inside Bupkus' bedroom, they saw Bupkus lying in bed; he was sweaty from his forehead. \"Oh my goodness.\" Granny said. They start on checking Bupkus' pulse, blood pressure, take his temperature, check his eyes, his throat, his ears, listened to his heart. Before they do something else however, Bupkus groaned and starts to open his eyes a little and saw the Tunes and the other Monstars in his bedroom, which they all had a huge sigh of relief. \"Guys? W-where am I? And…how did I get here?\" He asked. \"You're in Monstar Manor, in your own bedroom, doc.\" Bugs said while crunching on a carrot. \"Yeah, you gave us quite a fright, dude.\" Blanko said. \"I'm sorry, guys. I…I don't know what came over me. At the gym, I was feeling fine, until, I start to feel sweaty, then I felt dizzy in my eyes and then I ended up here.\" Bupkus said trying to remember on what happened to him. \"Ooh! That is a good thing that we got back up here.\" Daffy Duck said. \"How long was I out?\" Bupkus asked. \"Not long. About five or six hours.\" Lola said. \"Whoa! Five or six hours? Phew, that's a long time.\" Bupkus said, feeling surprised that he has been out that long. \"Bupkus, not to sound rude or anything, we think its best is for you to just lie in bed, just to take it easy. I think that playing basketball earlier today must've made you overwork yourself.\" Pound said. \"Me? Overwork myself? You can't be serious!\" Bupkus said, feeling shocked on what he's hearing. \"We are seriously serious about this, man. From what happened there, it really scared us. But just…try to take it easy for a while. For us…please.\" Bang said while looking at Bupkus. However, Bupkus starts to look at the Tunes and the other Monstars, and then he sighs in defeat and says, \"All right, I'll be careful from now on. If I messed up, I will just hit myself in the head.\" Bupkus said. The Tunes and the other Monstars laughed a bit from Bupkus' joke and they all decided to let him be. After the Tunes and the other Monstars left, Bupkus was all alone in his bedroom; he starts on walking around in his bedroom, thinking on what they just said to him about taking it easy. However, he starts to think to himself, \"I really wonder what happened to me. Whatever it is, I hope it's gone for good, so I could get back in the swing of things.\" He thought. Until, all of his thoughts were interrupted when he felt his stomach turned upside, which made him put his hand over his mouth and runs out of his bedroom and went into the bathroom and then he just…vomits in the bathroom toilet. When morning came at the Monstar Manor, Bupkus came out of his bedroom to go downstairs to get some breakfast; he saw Bang, Blanko, Nawt, Pound, along with Witch Hazel and Granny in the living room. They all looked up at him with a warm smile. \"Good morning, everybody.\" Bupkus said with a smile, until he had a small yawn. \"You feeling okay, man?\" Bang asked. \"Yeah, I am just a little tired and also hungry as well.\" Bupkus said while hearing his stomach growl. \"Not to worry, dearie. Breakfast will be ready shortly.\" Granny said while knitting. \"Thank you for telling me, Granny. While breakfast is being cooked, maybe I could get something to drink, like an ice cold glass of milk.\" Bupkus said while going into the kitchen to get a glass of milk and then he just gulps it all up with a huge sigh of relief and says, \"Refreshing!\" He said. \"Breakfast is ready!\" Pound said, which everyone came to the table and they start on eating eggs, toast, and bacon and also had some orange juice as well. While Bupkus was eating his breakfast, the smell of the bacon got into his nose, which somehow made his stomach turned upside down and made him put his hand over his mouth, gets up quickly and rushes to the bathroom and vomits again. Bupkus was in the bathroom, vomiting, he was breathing heavily and wipes his forehead from feeling sweaty. \"Boy. I don't know what was wrong with me. And the smell of the food made my stomach turned upside down, which I don't know why. But I hope it's nothing bad, I hope.\" He thought to himself while catching his breath from throwing up. \"Bupkus? Are you okay in there?\" Pound asked while knocking on the bathroom door. Bupkus groaned and he just walked out of the bathroom, looks up at Pound, feeling drowsy. Pound noticed that Bupkus was feeling drowsy and could smell the vomiting smell from Bupkus' breath. \"You don't look so good, man.\" He said, feeling concern. \"Yeah, Pound. My stomach is just upset; I was throwing up in the bathroom.\" Bupkus said feeling drowsy and holding onto his head with his hand. \"How about you go ahead and get some rest? I will send Witch Hazel and Granny up there to check on you, okay?\" Pound asked, feeling concern. Bupkus gave Pound a small smile and nod his head and he heads to his bedroom for some rest. \"I wonder what is happening to Bupkus. Whatever it is, I hope Granny and Witch Hazel will find a cure.\" Pound thought to himself. Bupkus went into his bedroom and he just lays down in his bed to rest his eyes a bit, until Witch Hazel and Granny came up to check on him. \"Hey, ladies. I'm sorry I don't feel too well.\" He said while putting his hand on his head, because he has a headache. \"Don't worry, dearie. We're here to help you get better.\" Granny said. \"Where does it hurt?\" Witch Hazel asked while putting gloves on. \"On my stomach…Ooh! Excuse me, ladies!\" Bupkus said and rushes out of his bedroom and goes into the bathroom and vomits. Witch Hazel and Granny saw what Bupkus did and winced. \"Granny, write that symptom down; vomiting.\" Witch Hazel said. \"You got it, sister.\" Granny said and wrote down on what they just saw, but so far on their note-pad, they got; Passing Out Groaning Headaches Feeling Drowsy Vomiting Witch Hazel and Granny have been keeping a close eye on Bupkus on what he's been going through lately and they yet still have no idea what was happening to him. Once they got to Witch Hazel's shop to figure out a cure to Bupkus' strange illness. \"What do you got so far, sister?\" Granny asked. \"Well, dear sister Granny. I do have good news and bad news. The bad news is according to these symptoms that Bupkus has been going through; I start to think that it could be a tumor. The other thing is that that tumor is small, which it could take months for it to grow.\" Witch Hazel said while going through the note-pad. \"What is the good news, sister?\" Granny asked. \"The good news is that once that tumor stops growing in about nine months, it will soon leave Bupkus' body for good, which it makes Bupkus go back to normal again.\" Witch Hazel said. \"How many months again, sister?\" Granny asked. \"Nine months, dear sister.\" Witch Hazel said. \"When are we gonna tell Bupkus?\" Granny asked. \"We may have to tell him if we could get him to my shop…tonight.\" Witch Hazel said and they both looked out the window of Witch Hazel's shop and looked at the sun going down to pray and hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Chapter 3: The Telling and Cravings When night came to Looney Tune Land, Bupkus got a note from Witch Hazel saying that he needs to go to her shop right away with just himself, which Witch Hazel and Granny need to talk to him alone. \"Hey, guys. I got a note from Witch Hazel.\" He said. \"What does she want, dude?\" Blanko asked. \"She wants me to go over to her shop right away.\" Bupkus said. \"Are you going to be alright on your own?\" Bang asked. \"Don't worry fellas. I'll be fine. I will tell you what Witch Hazel said to me once I get back.\" Bupkus said and he head out the door. Once Bupkus got to Witch Hazel's shop, he knocked on her door gently, which Granny answered it. \"Ah! Bupkus, dearie. We're so glad that you came. Come on in.\" Granny said and lets Bupkus inside the shop. Bupkus walked around the shop and then he saw Witch Hazel at her little table. \"Ah! Bupkus dearie. Did you get my note?\" Witch Hazel asked. \"I sure did, Witch Hazel. What's going on?\" Bupkus asked, feeling anxious. \"You will see once we wait for Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny to come.\" Witch Hazel said. \"Wait a minute? Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny are coming too?\" Bupkus asked, feeling surprised. \"Yes, they are coming. The reason why we called them up as well is because they were concern about you and maybe they could be able to help you as well.\" Granny said. Then, the floor starts to shake and then, popped up are Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. \"Well, here we are, Granny and Witch Hazel. Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny at your service.\" Bugs Bunny said coming out of the hole. Bupkus was surprised to see Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. \"Hey, guys. This is definitely a surprise. And the other thing is; WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO TO ME?!\" He shouted, feeling surprised and angry at the same time and he start to have a growl in his throat, until he changed his attitude a bit & say, \"I really do appreciate your concern since you guys were worried about me.\" Witch Hazel saw Bupkus' mood swing and whispers to Granny to write it down, which Granny nodded her head and writes it down. \"Bupkus? Are you alright?\" Lola asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. I just…don't know what came over me.\" Bupkus said, feeling a little light-headed. \"Don't worry about it, doc. That was one heck of a mood swing. I'm sure Witch Hazel and Granny will know the cure to your illness.\" Bugs Bunny said. \"You really think so?\" Bupkus asked. \"Of course we're sure, dearie. In fact, it's more of good news and bad news.\" Granny said. \"What is it?\" Bupkus asked, looking at Witch Hazel and Granny. \"The bad news is we found out what is happening to you.\" Witch Hazel said. \"What do I have?\" Bupkus asked, feeling anxious and light-headed at the same time. \"Well, inside your stomach, which is your lower stomach, you have is a…tumor.\" Witch Hazel said. \"A WHAT?!\" Bupkus asked, feeling shocked. Witch Hazel and Granny just sighed and say, \"A tumor.\" Bupkus got up on his feet, pacing back and forth. \"How is that even physically possible?!\" He asked. Witch Hazel looks up at Bupkus pacing back and forth and says, \"Well, from what we have saw what you have been going through, like passing out, vomiting, drowsy, headaches and also a mood swing as well. That's why we thought you may is a tumor inside your lower stomach when you once told us that your lower stomach was hurting since after you throw up.\" Bupkus looks down at Witch Hazel and say, \"Are you sure?\" Witch Hazel said, \"Yes, I am absolutely sure.\" Then, Bupkus went back to his seat and puts his head in his hand feeling a headache and then, he looks back at Witch Hazel and Granny. \"What's the good news?\" He asked. \"The good news is dearie, we just found out how long that tumor will grow and it will soon leave your body.\" Granny said. \"Oh. How long will that take?\" Bupkus asked. \"About…nine months.\" Witch Hazel said. \"Nine months? That long? Whoa! So I have to wait for nine months for this…tumor to grow and then, it will leave out of me. That is something.\" Bugs looked at Bupkus, \"Oh, that is something indeed there, doc. Just like Witch Hazel and Granny said, we'll be here to help you.\" He said. \"Bugs is right, Bupkus. We're just concern about you, that's all.\" Lola said. Bupkus looked at Bugs and Lola with tears rolling down from his face, gently gives them both a hug and cries softly. \"It's okay, doc. We're here for you. We'll be here to support you as well.\" Bugs said while patting Bupkus' back. \"No, Bugs. It's not that…I'm just afraid on how I'm gonna tell the others about this. They don't like when we kept secrets from each other.\" Bupkus said with tears rolling down his face. \"Ooh! Don't cry, Bupkus. It's okay. We'll help you tell them. If they don't believe you, we'll let Witch Hazel and Granny explain everything to them; hopefully the others will be able to support you whenever they can.\" Lola said. \"Oh…okay. I hope you're right.\" Bupkus said while wiping away his tears with a tissue. \"I'm sure we're right.\" Bugs said while crunching on a carrot. Once Bupkus, along with Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, Witch Hazel and Granny return to Monstar Manor, Bupkus took a deep breath and opens the door and lets everyone inside. Pound, Blanko, Nawt and Bang were surprised to see Bupkus came back to Monstar Manor, along with Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, Witch Hazel and Granny with him. \"Wow, Bupkus, you bought the whole party. What unexpected.\" Pound said, feeling surprised. \"Yeah, it is quite a surprise. However, fellas, there's something that I need…to tell you. It may be…a shock.\" Bupkus said, feeling nervous on what he's going to say to the other Monstars. \"Oh, what was it, dude?\" Blanko asked. \"First of all, guys. You better sit down and I will tell you.\" Bupkus said and then the other Monstars all took their seats and they all looked up at Bupkus. Bupkus start to look at Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, Witch Hazel and Granny, which they all nod their heads and then, he starts to take a deep breath, got himself to calm down and then, he spoke, \"Guys. There's some good news and bad news. However, the bad news is…both Witch Hazel and Granny did found out what was happening to me. However, the thing that they found is coming from…my lower stomach. The way I was having those symptoms that you guys have been noticing, they were; passing out, dizziness, vomiting, headaches and feeling drowsy. That thing inside my lower stomach is…a tumor.\" The other Monstars were surprised to hear that Bupkus has a tumor in his lower stomach. \"However, guys. Before you say anything, there's some good news as well.\" Bupkus said. \"What is the good news, man?\" Bang asked, feeling anxious. \"The good news is…Witch Hazel said to me that the tumor is small, so I have to wait to let it grow in about…nine months, which we know it'll take a long time for it to grow. But once on the ninth month, it will…leave my body and I will be back to normal again.\" Bupkus said with a small smile upon his face. \"Wow. That is something and very…odd.\" Pound said, feeling a little surprised. \"Does this mean that you guys will support me and help me through it as well?\" Bupkus asked. Pound, Bang, Blanko and Nawt looked at each other for a moment, they looked at Witch Hazel, Lola Bunny, Granny and Bugs Bunny, who were nodding their heads and then, they looked at Bupkus with a small smile and Pound spoke, \"Of course we will support you, man. After all, you're like a brother to us. Friends stick to the end.\" All of the sudden, Bupkus smile and gave each of them a fist-bump, a high-five and a hug as well. \"Thanks, guys.\" He said with a small smile. \"Eh, not to interrupt, doc, but what is that delicious smell?\" Bugs asked. \"That will be my spicy chili.\" Bang said. \"Ooh, that smells good. You know, I will like to try some.\" Bupkus said. \"Okay, it'll be ready shortly.\" Bang said while stirring his spicy chili. While the other Monstars were doing their usual things, Bupkus looked at Witch Hazel and he asks quietly, \"Witch Hazel, when it comes to this…tumor that I have, what do you want me to do for now?\" Witch Hazel looked up at Bupkus and then, she thought of an idea. \"Well, if I was in your position, I will suggest to be sure to keep track on what you're eating, eat foods that are healthy, be sure to drink a lot of milk, so your bones will stay strong, do small exercises, don't overwork yourself like last time. And once that…tumor gets bigger, I will suggest to get plenty of bed-rest, but you can still go use the bathroom or get something to eat or drink as well, just little things.\" She said. \"Okay, I'll try. Anything else?\" Bupkus asked while writing everything down on his note-pad. \"Well, when it gets close to the ninth month, you may…feel the urge to…clean Monstar Manor from top to bottom.\" Witch Hazel said. \"Whoa! Cleaning the Monstar Manor? That's a lot of work.\" Bupkus said while writing it down on his note-pad. \"I know, dearie. But you will have some help to help you with everything.\" Granny said. \"Chili is ready.\" Bang said. And they all head to the kitchen, which somehow made Bupkus' eyes go wide while seeing all that chili in that giant pot. \"That looks great!\" He said, feeling excited. \"Dig in!\" Bang said. And they all grabbed their bowls and spoons, until Bupkus starts on eating the chili until his bowl became empty and he was getting seconds, along with a glass of cold milk as his beverage. \"Mm! This is delicious, Bang.\" Bupkus said with his mouth full and his lips covered with the chili sauce. \"Wow. I am glad you think so, man. I noticed that you made a little mess of yourself as well.\" Bang said with a little chuckle. Bupkus looked down at his lips and noticed that his lips were covered with chili sauce. \"Oh, right. Sorry, where are my manners? Thanks.\" He said, feeling bashful, grabs a napkin from the table and wipes the chili sauce from his lips. And then, Bupkus starts on grabbing some more spicy chili from the pot, which somehow made the other Monstars & the Tunes feeling very surprised that Bupkus loves the spicy chili. \"I can see that Bupkus loves your spicy chili, Bang dearie.\" Granny said. \"Yeah…I can see that.\" Bang said, feeling speechless. Chapter 4: Through Everything Day after day, Witch Hazel and Granny have been checking on Bupkus through having that tumor in his lower stomach. They've been seeing Bupkus been throwing up every morning to afternoon to late night a few times, which was causing Bupkus to lose a bit of his energy and haven't got any sleep as well. As for food cravings, Witch Hazel and Granny wrote down on their note-pads that Bupkus has been craving a lot of milk, and they sometimes noticed that Bupkus usually gets a mood swing or two whenever the other Monstars had to get some more milk whenever the milk smells funny, the expiration date is ended or in case if they're all out as well. \"Guys! We're all out of milk again. One of you guys needs to get some more. LOOK AT ME; CAN YOU SEE THAT I AM ANGRY RIGHT NOW?! Do I look fat to you? Aaah!\" Bupkus said while going through a mood swing and then, he grabs a few pieces of fruit, like apples, purple grapes (his favorite), including a watermelon as well. \"A watermelon?\" Nawt asked, feeling very surprised. \"I can't help it, I'm just…craving it, I suppose.\" Bupkus said, feeling bashful while eating some watermelon. In the fourth and fifth month, Bupkus has been trying to lose weight; however, his stomach just kept pushing forward, not back. When he went on the scale, he realized that he's been gaining weight. \"Terrific! Why am I still gaining weight? I thought I was losing weight.\" He said to himself. \"Note to self, maybe I should exercise a bit more.\" He added after he came out of the bathroom. And so, he went into the gym of Monstar Manor, and starts on doing his little warm-ups, like curl-ups, pull-ups on the bars, push-ups, stretches, and then, he starts on dribbling the basketball and shoot some hoops. \"I hope this weight and the tumor will go away soon. I really need to get back in shape.\" He thought to himself, after he was done with shooting hoops. Once the basketball has stopped bouncing, it rolled next to his feet, which causes Bupkus to try to pick it up. \"How very odd. I cannot seem to pick up the basketball and the other thing is, I can't even see my feet either. This is totally strange.\" He said while trying to pick up the basketball with his hands, until, he got the basketball into his hands one more time after he picked it up again. And then, he went out of the gym and just went to the bathroom to get a nice warm shower to wash away all the sweat that was coming from his face to his back. In the sixth and seventh month, Bupkus was having a hard time on how to get up, which one or two of the Monstars, like Bang and Pound had to help him up whenever he needs something from the kitchen, something to read or need to use the bathroom. However, whenever he wakes up every morning to start his day, he looks at his reflection in the mirror that he has in his purple bedroom, when he puts his jersey and shorts on, he noticed that his jersey and his shorts were getting too small and too tight on him. \"Wow, my clothes don't seem to fit me anymore. I may have to ask Granny and Witch Hazel if they could make a bigger jersey and shorts for me to wear since I am getting bigger.\" He said while looking at his reflection while grabs his purple sweat-pants and a purple tank, puts his jersey and shorts in a bag and heads out of the door to Granny's home. Once Bupkus got to Granny's place, he saw Witch Hazel with Granny doing some knitting, he also see Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny, along with Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety and Sylvester as well. \"Wow, looks like the gang is here.\" He said to himself and then, he knocks on the door gently. Granny went over to the door and saw Bupkus. \"Hi, Bupkus dearie. What a pleasant surprise.\" She said, feeling a little surprised. \"Hi, Granny. Hi, everybody.\" Bupkus said with a smile upon his face. \"Hey, Bupkus.\" Lola said. \"Hey, sonny.\" Foghorn Leghorn said. \"Hiya, Bupkus.\" Tweety said while flying next to his face. \"Hey, Bupkus.\" Sylvester said with a little spit from his mouth with his tongue. \"Hey, big guy.\" Daffy Duck said. \"Hey there, doc.\" Bugs Bunny said. \"Hey. Granny, Witch Hazel, I do have a problem.\" Bupkus said while showing them his jersey and his shorts. \"What is it, dearie?\" Granny asked. \"My jersey and shorts seem don't fit me anymore. I was thinking, if you guys could, you know…make them bigger. Please?\" Bupkus asked. \"Of course we can, dearie. Anything for you, dearie. While we're doing that, you can make yourself at home. The others were doing some knitting with their favorite color of yarn.\" Granny said. \"Thanks. And, when it comes to knitting, can I try it out as well? My favorite color is purple.\" Bupkus said. \"Certainly, dearie.\" Granny said and hands Bupkus purple yarn while Bupkus hands her the bag of his jersey and shorts. Bupkus joined the other Tunes and got start on knitting with his favorite color of yarn. Granny and Witch Hazel worked together on making Bupkus' jersey and shorts to make them bigger, so they could fit on Bupkus. Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn and Tweety Bird were very surprised to see Bupkus getting started on knitting and they all just continue on knitting with their favorite color of yarn. They continue on knitting when Granny and Witch Hazel got finished fixing on Bupkus' jersey and shorts. \"There you go, dearie. Your jersey and shorts are all finished. Hopefully they will fit on you a lot better.\" Granny said. \"Thank you, ladies. You're amazing.\" Bupkus said with a smile while still doing knitting. \"What are you making, dearie?\" Witch Hazel asked. \"Oh, I am just making a nice blanket. Not to sound crazy, I have also been knitting smaller things as well, which I don't know why, but…I just…can't help it.\" Bupkus said while showing Granny and Witch Hazel, including Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny on what he had knitted. He knitted a purple blanket, including a little outfit that looks just like his outfit that Granny and Witch Hazel had fixed and he also knit little footies as well, which somehow made Granny, Witch Hazel, Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny all go, \"Aw!\" with small happy faces. Bupkus smiled while looking at his little creations that he made. \"Yeah. I don't know why I made those little things, which I can't help it. But still, I find them very cute and adorable.\" He said. \"I see.\" Witch Hazel said, feeling surprised. Bupkus felt something that kicked inside his stomach. \"Ouch!\" He groaned, while putting a hand on his stomach. \"Bupkus? Are you okay, doc?\" Bugs Bunny asked, feeling concern. \"Yeah, I'm okay. I just felt something kicked me.\" Bupkus said while rubbing his stomach on where he felt the strong kick. \"Hmm. Where does it hurt, dearie?\" Witch Hazel asked. \"It hurts right over here.\" Bupkus said while pointing at the spot where he felt the kick, which it came from the top. \"Ooh, I see. If I was in your position, dearie. I will suggest to relax, like put your feet up, read a book, something like that.\" Granny said. \"Okay, I will try that. But…not to sound crazy again, I think I am feeling that urge.\" Bupkus said, feeling his toes and his feet as well. \"What urge is that?\" Lola asked. \"It's the urge when I had to…clean something. Excuse me.\" Bupkus said and then he just zipped fast to Granny's closet and just starts on cleaning her place from top to bottom, he even cleaned her chimney as well, which it took him about an hour or two of doing all the cleaning at Granny's place. Since after Bupkus left with his new bigger jersey and shorts, including his little creations that he made and also with his purple yarn and tinsels so he could do some more knitting at Monstar Manor, he got to the door of Monstar Manor, put his stuff in his bedroom, until, he felt that same urge again, which causes him to zip fast to the closet and starts on cleaning Monstar Manor from top to bottom, like he starts the kitchen, then the dining room, the living room where the other Monstars were all watching him do some cleaning, they looked at each other and then, they decided to help him out with the cleaning to make things a lot easier instead of cleaning the place by one person. \"Oh, thanks, guys. You don't have to do that.\" Bupkus said with a small smile while looking at the other Monstars helping him with the cleaning. \"Hey, we just want to help you out, dude.\" Blanko said. \"Yeah, we were amazed on what you were doing as well.\" Bang said, feeling impressed. \"Hey. I just couldn't help it; I just have this urge to start on cleaning, which I don't know why.\" Bupkus said while cleaning the living room, and then, a short time later, he starts on cleaning the upstairs hallway, including the bathroom, the closet, and then, he and the other Monstars all start on cleaning their own bedrooms. Bupkus cleaned his purple bedroom, Pound cleaned his orange bedroom, Blanko cleaned his blue bedroom, Bang cleaned his green bedroom and Nawt cleaned his red bedroom. Chapter 5: Eighth Month When the eighth month come for Bupkus, he was starting to get bigger and bigger in his lower stomach, which it's still hard for him to move, he couldn't move any faster which causes his back to hurt as well. \"Oh man! My poor poor back is hurting.\" He said while rubbing his back with his hand when trying to get up. \"Don't worry, doc. We hope the pain will go away soon. We just have to be patient for another month, which is the ninth month. But still, Lola, Witch Hazel, Granny, myself and everybody will be here to support you and also help you through everything as well.\" Bugs Bunny said. \"You really think so?\" Bupkus asked. \"Of course, I'm sure. There's one thing we do like best about you, Bupkus.\" Bugs Bunny said. \"What thing is that, Bugs?\" Bupkus said. \"That will be your kind nature. After all, you and your friends are very kind now.\" Bugs Bunny said. \"Bugs is right, Bupkus. We like your kind nature. Everyone knows that you have a kind heart when it comes to us Tunes.\" Lola said while patting Bupkus' head gently to cheer him up a bit, which somehow made Bupkus wiggled his brows as if by saying, \"Thanks, I am a good guy after all.\" Later, Bupkus went to see Granny and Witch Hazel while walking slowly with his hand on his back, then, he knocked on the door, which Granny answered it and lets Bupkus inside. \"Thanks for letting me in, Granny. However, I just want to let you and Witch Hazel know that my back has been hurting me a lot; my feet are swollen, which causes me to wear different comfortable shoes. I just wish there's a way to get rid of my aching back and my swollen feet.\" Bupkus said while sitting down on a nice soft comfy rocking chair with a sigh. \"Not to worry, dearie. I think maybe a nice massage could maybe help. I will rub your back, while Witch Hazel could rub your feet. If you feel pain, you just tell us to stop.\" Granny said while she and Witch Hazel about to rub Bupkus' back and feet. \"Thanks, ladies. You're amazing. Is there…anything else?\" Bupkus asked. \"Well, after we give you that massage, we could teach you on how to do some breathing techniques whenever the pain is getting stronger by the minute that is.\" Witch Hazel said while rubbing Bupkus' swollen feet and Granny rubs his aching back. \"I see. What will the breathing techniques will do?\" Bupkus asked. \"It's quite simple, dearie. The breathing techniques will help you stay calm whenever you feel the pain getting stronger by the minute, which all you have to do is breathe.\" Granny said while rubbing his back. \"Just…breathe?\" Bupkus asked. \"Exactly.\" Witch Hazel said. \"I hope you're right, ladies. Still, we only got one month left till this tumor goes away. The strange thing is, whenever I looked at myself in the mirror when I wake up in the morning, I start on talking to my stomach and I also been reading out loud as well, which I don't know why I did it.\" Bupkus said with a sigh while getting the nice massage from Granny and Witch Hazel. \"I'm sure it will go away soon, dearie. Just be very patient.\" Granny said. \"I'll try.\" Bupkus said with a smile. A short time later, after Bupkus had a massage from Granny and Witch Hazel, Bupkus still sat on the soft comfy chair, then, Granny and Witch Hazel start to teach him on how to do some breathing exercises. \"Now, dearie. Whenever you feel something that is shooting from your back to your stomach, just focus on your breathing, like this; Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Just like you're blowing a balloon or a trick-candle.\" Witch Hazel said, then, Bupkus starts on that breathing technique, \"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.\" He breathed. \"The next breathing technique is like this; Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah.\" Granny said. \"Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah.\" Bupkus breathed, feeling a little queasy. \"The other breathing technique is like this one; Hee, hee, foo, hee, hee, foo, hee, hee, foo.\" Granny said, \"Hee, hee, foo, hee, hee, foo. Uh…Granny, Witch Hazel. I'm feeling light-headed. Can we stop, please?\" Bupkus asked while putting his hand on his forehead. \"Of course, dearie. Once you get home, please be sure to have plenty of bed-rest, be sure to drink a lot of water and practice your breathing techniques.\" Granny said. \"Got it.\" Bupkus said while getting up slowly. \"Thank you for inviting me, ladies. Have a wonderful evening.\" He added before he headed out of the door. \"You're very welcome, dearie. You do the same.\" Granny said with a smile. Chapter 6: Special Delivery Bupkus was walking around in the kitchen slowly with his hand on his back and he paused to take a little breather and then, he looked at Bang, who was feeling concern for him. \"I don't want you to go anywhere today, man.\" Bang said, feeling concern. \"Hmm. If I go anywhere, it will be slowly.\" Bupkus said while looking at Bang and walks over to the table to have a seat. \"Do you need anything?\" Bang asked. \"Some water will be nice, please.\" Bupkus said while rubbing his stomach with his hand, which he felt a kick and he looks down at his stomach and whispers to his stomach, \"Quit kicking me. It hurts.\" And he just continues on rubbing his stomach. Bang hands over his drink and walks out of the kitchen. \"Thanks, man.\" Bupkus said and he drinks his water. \"No problem. Just take it easy.\" Bang said. \"Yeah, I will. Anyway, I am going to try to get some rest, I need to stay off my feet.\" Bupkus said while walking into the living room and go upstairs to his bedroom. \"Do you want some pizza, dude? We're gonna start ordering some.\" Blanko said while grabbing the phone. \"No thanks, Blanko. I am just heading to bed. I will let you guys know if I need anything.\" Bupkus said while heading upstairs to his bedroom. \"I'm worried about Bupkus, guys. This is the ninth month and nothing's happening so far.\" Bang said. \"I agree with you. I bet it's that tumor that's doing this to him to make him act funny. But still, from the beginning, we're all here to support him and help him through it.\" Pound said. \"Don't forget about us, doc.\" Bugs Bunny said while popping out from the floor. \"When did you guys get here?\" Nawt asked. \"Just a while ago.\" Lola Bunny said while coming out. \"Yeah, we just to visit you guys and also want to cheer Bupkus up.\" Daffy Duck said. \"Speaking of Bupkus, we need to check on him. Where is he?\" Bugs Bunny asked. \"He's upstairs in his bedroom resting. You can check on him, just to be on the safe side.\" Bang said, pointing upstairs. \"Thanks, doc. Come on, Lola. Let's go check on him.\" Bugs said to Lola, which they all head upstairs to Bupkus' purple bedroom. They quietly opened the door of Bupkus' bedroom; they saw Bupkus looking very pale, his face in pain, his hand on his lower stomach and gritting his teeth. \"Bupkus? Are you okay, doc?\" Bugs asked, feeling concern. \"Bugs? Is that you?\" Bupkus asked, feeling pain in his lower stomach. \"Yes, doc. It is. What's wrong?\" Bugs asked. \"It's…ahh! My back is hurting badly. I can't take much of it anymore.\" Bupkus said, feeling pain while lying down in bed. \"Is there anything we can do to help?\" Lola asked. \"Go get Granny. And, go get Witch Hazel too.\" Bupkus said, feeling more pain coming from his back to his stomach. \"What do you want us to tell them?\" Bugs asked. \"Tell them…the tumor is coming out of me!\" Bupkus said, feeling more pain while looking at Bugs and Lola. \"When?\" Bugs and Lola asked at the same time. \"NOW!\" Bupkus said, feeling much more pain. Bugs and Lola both gasped on hearing on what Bupkus had told them. Rain start to fall from the sky on a cold night at Monstar Manor in Looney Tune Land, up in Bupkus' bedroom, Bupkus was breathing heavily through the strong pressure from his back to his stomach, which made his eyes go wide, grit his teeth while feeling the pain. \"Just hang in there, dearie. We're getting close.\" Granny said, who is looking at Bupkus, who is in a lot of pain and continues on his breathing. \"Can we help?\" Pound asked, peeking through the door. \"Everything in purple, Pound. Get some blankets, towels, a bassinet, clean scissors and purple sheets.\" Granny said while looking at Pound and the other Monstars while trying to focus on helping Bupkus with his breathing. \"Yes, madam. Blanko, get the purple blankets from the laundry closet. Nawt, get the purple bassinet from the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. Bang, get the purple towels from the laundry cabinet, including the purple sheets as well. I will get the purple-handled scissors from the kitchen drawer.\" Pound said, and then, they all went in different directions to get the stuff that they're asked to get. Bugs Bunny went back upstairs with a cup full of ice to help Bupkus ease the pain while eating some ice, Lola Bunny went to wet a purple wash-cloth with a bucket full of icy cold water and wipes Bupkus' forehead. Bupkus continues on breathing while feeling more pressure. Once the other Monstars got everything they asked for, they all hand them over to Bugs and Lola, which they set the bassinet and the scissors next to the bed, they placed the blankets, towels and sheets on a chair as well, until the other Monstars went outside of the bedroom while pacing back and forth to wait on what will happen next. A short time later, their pizza had arrived, which they went downstairs to get the pizza, pay the pizza delivery guy and they start to eat the pizza and saved a few slices of pizza for Bupkus, in case if Bupkus wants some pizza that is. Back upstairs in Bupkus' bedroom, Bupkus starts to bare down while closing his eyes and gritting his teeth. \"Oww!\" Bupkus groaned in pain while bearing down. \"Oh, way to go, dearie.\" Granny said. \"Oh, there.\" Witch Hazel said while helping Bupkus bare down. Bupkus continues on bearing down, until his bed got all liquidly and then…a baby cry filled the whole Monstar Manor, which causes the other Monstars to all gasp and head upstairs to Bupkus' bedroom. \"Wow. This is totally unexpected…it turns out that tumor turned…into a baby.\" Witch Hazel said. \"Is the baby…a boy or a girl?\" Granny asked. Witch Hazel looked at the gender and looks at Granny with a smile, \"It's a girl.\" She said. Bupkus was breathing heavily while closing his eyes with his head lay back on his purple pillow, until he heard a baby cry, \"Why am I hearing a baby cry?\" He asked. \"Bupkus dearie, to be very shocking, it looks like that tumor that was inside of you…it turned into…a baby.\" Granny said. \"A baby?!\" Bupkus asked, feeling surprised to hear that a tumor turned into a baby that came out of him. \"Yes, dearie. Don't panic, when you hear the baby crying or wailing, it's alive. And it must've been kicking you when you're carrying it.\" Witch Hazel said. Bugs and Lola were cleaning the little purple baby girl up with a towel, until; Bupkus starts to have small tears falling down his face. \"I just can't believe I had a baby.\" He said, sobbing softly. Granny grabbed a tissue and wipes away his tears falling down his face. \"It's okay, dearie. Your baby is doing okay.\" Granny said, comforting him. \"Can I see the baby?\" Bupkus asked. \"Of course, you can, dearie.\" Witch Hazel said. Lola picks up the little purple baby girl in her hands, walks over to Bupkus, which at the same time, Bupkus had a small smile upon his face, had his hands up a bit while Lola hands him the baby over to him for him to see. Bupkus looks down at the little purple baby girl in his arms for the first time, which the baby is the same color as him with the same hair color as well, five fingers on each little hand, and five toes on each little foot. The baby cooed for a moment while looking up at her daddy, until Bupkus starts to look at her with a little smile. \"She's beautiful.\" He said softly, which the baby starts on wailing a little bit, until, she stopped her wailing while looking up at her daddy who was covering her with his jersey as a little blanket and gently puts a little purple bow in her hair, he even lets his baby girl suck on his finger. All of the sudden, Pound, Bang, Blanko and Nawt all came upstairs to see what was going on, until Bugs saw them with a warm smile. \"Hey there, docs. Bupkus has someone for you four to meet.\" He said while crunching on a carrot. \"We heard…a baby cry?\" Pound asked. \"Yes, Pound. That was a baby cry. However, it looks like and turns out that tumor turned out to be a baby after all this time.\" Lola said while holding onto Bugs' hand. \"Mind if we come in and see?\" Nawt asked. \"Of course, dearies. Come on in and meet the newest member of your team.\" Granny said while cleaning everything up. And they all head inside Bupkus' purple bedroom, they saw Bupkus lying in bed and holding onto his baby girl in his arms and his baby girl is all wrapped up in his jersey as a blanket while sucking on his finger. Bupkus looked up and saw his friends coming in and they all walked towards him and sit on the bed and they all looked awed at Bupkus' baby girl in his arms. \"Hey, guys. Meet little Maria.\" Bupkus said with a warm smile, tears rolling down his face and looks at little Maria snuggled in his arms sucking on his finger. \"Hey, little one. You're very adorable.\" Blanko said while looking at little Maria in Bupkus' arms. \"Wow. Looks like that tumor must've turned out to be a baby after all this time, huh?\" Nawt asked. \"Yeah, which I didn't even know either. Granny and Witch Hazel thought it was a tumor, but judging by the kicking, it turned out to be little Maria was doing the kicking the whole time.\" Bupkus said while looking down at little Maria and then, he starts to give little Maria a kiss on her forehead. \"She looks just like you, man.\" Bang said with a little grin. \"Yeah, she does look like mini me. When I hold her in my arms for the first time, it did made me feel…soft, because Bugs once told me that there's one thing you guys like about me and that is my kind nature. This little one made me realized it…she needs me, guys. I really want to keep her. I will do everything I can to raise her, so she could still be a member to our team and also our family.\" Bupkus said while continuing on holding little Maria in his arms and then, he starts to wrap her up in a nice soft purple blanket to keep her warm. \"I'm sure you will make a wonderful dad, man. We're here for you both. You and little Maria.\" Pound said while using his finger to stroke little Maria's little cheek. Bupkus smiled hearing those words from Pound, they all gave him a fist-bump, a hug and high-five, until, little Maria starts to make a small whimper sound, as if by saying she's hungry. \"Do we have any baby bottles?\" Bang asked, feeling curious. \"Yeah and where is little Maria gonna sleep at?\" Nawt asked, feeling curious as well. Bupkus and Pound looked at each other for a moment when they noticed that little Maria is getting hungry and needs a place to sleep. \"I think little Maria could sleep with me for the time being once we get everything we need to help little Maria.\" Bupkus said. \"I agree with you, man. And we may need to find some baby bottles.\" Pound said. \"And we also need some diapers, baby wipes, a changing table, a crib, a baby stroller, a baby high-chair, a baby swing, baby clothes, baby bath-tub, formula.\" Bupkus said. \"Good plan. We'll make a list of everything that little Maria will need and see what we can do from there.\" Pound said. \"Right.\" Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt said at the same time. While Bupkus was lying in bed with little Maria still whimpering, Bupkus tries to get little Maria to calm her down. \"Shhh, shhh, it's okay, cutie-pie. Daddy's here.\" He said while comforting little Maria. \"Oh, Bupkus, my man. We have some surprises for you.\" Pound said, feeling cheerfully. \"Oh. What are those surprises?\" Bupkus asked. \"We'll show you. Come on, guys.\" Pound said, then, he, the other Monstars and the Tunes all came in with wonderful gifts for little Maria. Bupkus almost flipped out when he saw the baby crib in a lavender color, with matching curtains, matching bedding, including a lavender baby high-chair. He also saw some bottles, diapers, baby wipes, formula, pacifiers, baby toys, baby outfits, a baby stroller, a baby slang, a changing table, a baby swing, a baby bath-tub with some baby shampoo, baby soap, a baby lavender towel, baby radios, baby quilts all made out of yarn made by Granny and Witch Hazel, including a few jars of baby food as well. \"Wow…guys? I…I really don't know what to say.\" Bupkus said, feeling speechless on seeing all the gifts to help him with little Maria. \"We just want to help you out, doc.\" Bugs said. \"Thank you…all of you. And…since we now have bottles. I am ready to start on giving little Maria her first bottle of warm milk.\" Bupkus said, still feeling speechless. \"Coming right up, dearie.\" Granny said, who went to grab one of the new bottles, went downstairs, starts to warm up the milk in the microwave for a minute, then, pours the milk into the bottle, and carries it upstairs back to Bupkus' purple bedroom. She then hands the bottle of warm milk to Bupkus, so he could feed little Maria. \"Here you go, sweetie-pie.\" Bupkus said softly to little Maria, which at the same time, little Maria saw the nipple of the bottle, latches on and starts on sucking by getting milk. \"Aww!\" The Tunes and the other Monstars said at the same time while they saw little Maria sucking on the bottle. A short time later, little Maria had her first meal from her first bottle of warm milk. Bupkus starts on patting little Maria's back to burp her, which causes little Maria to have a burp. \"Aww!\" The other Monstars said when they heard little Maria burped. Then, both Granny and Witch Hazel teach Bupkus on how to change a diaper, which they show how to clean little Maria's bottom with a baby wipe after the dirty diaper is thrown into the garbage can, they even show him on how to put a clean diaper on her as well. \"There you go, sweetie-pie. That feels a lot better, huh?\" Bupkus said while picking little Maria up and holds her in his arms while he wraps her up in his jersey as a blanket. \"Shh, I think we need to give them some time alone.\" Witch Hazel said to the other Tunes and the other Monstars, which they all agreed and they all head out of Bupkus' bedroom and left both Bupkus and little Maria alone together. When everything got quiet, Bupkus starts to lie in bed with little Maria snuggled in his arms all wrapped up in his jersey and he starts to look at little Maria. \"Wow…here you are. I didn't know you were inside of me the whole time. That was totally an unexpected surprise. Granny and Witch Hazel thought I had a tumor inside of my stomach growing for nine months, but, it turns out that they were wrong and were surprised to see that it was you inside of me after all this time. I am going to take good care of you, my little Maria. And once you get older enough, I will teach you some basketball moves, so you could be on my team with my other teammates, like Uncle Pound, Uncle Bang, Uncle Blanko and Uncle Nawt as well, along with your wonderful daddy, which is me.\" He said softly while looking down at little Maria snuggling in his arms until she left out a little hand and starts to hold onto his finger. Bupkus smiled seeing little Maria holding onto his finger. \"Wow, you do have a nice strong grip on my finger. I bet you're strong, just like me. When I was carrying you, which I didn't even know, I have been working out myself as well. Hopefully one day once you're older enough, you and I could do some working out together, so you and I could be strong together.\" He said softly, which at the same time, gives little Maria a kiss on her forehead, which made little Maria smile a little before she had a little yawn. \"Aw! You're tired? I bet you had a long day coming into the world.\" Bupkus said while looking down at little Maria, until he had a yawn himself. \"I'm a bit tired too. I guess I had a long day as well like going through a lot of pain and bringing you into the world as well. How about you and I get some sleep for the night?\" He added and then, he puts little Maria on his chest all wrapped up in his jersey and a nice soft purple blanket, he gives her a kiss on her forehead. \"Sweet dreams, my little Maria. Daddy loves you.\" He said in a whisper and then, he went to sleep for a nice long peaceful evening.

The looney toons are down 5 points after a late first half charge. Jordan and all the looney toons know what is on the line in the game \"Everybody is playing well but needs to step up their game a little bit in order to beat these guys.\" Said Jordan anxiously as he knows what's in store for him if they lose the game. \"C'mon guys we can pull this out.\" Said bugs in hope to lighten the spirits of a beat looney tunes team. RIIIIIIINNNGGGG! The sound of the second half buzzer goes off and everyone knows it's time to get back out there and play. Jordan leads the way out to the court with the looney tunes close behind. \"Everybody ready?\" Exclaims Jordan to get them pumped up \"Michael I'm scared.\" Whines Tweety Bird The player's line up against the huge Monstars clearly outsized. \"You guys ready to get crushed.\" Yells one of the Monstars Second half begins with looney toons ball Jordan takes it up the court only to be denied by a monster. The Monstars take it to the other end of the court and dunk it on bug's bunny making it a seven point game. Bugs slow to get up hobbles to the bench. At the end of quarter number three it is 72-65 Monstars. Needing a big fourth quarter from the looney tunes in order to pull off the victory. Jordan starts off the fourth quarter with high hopes knowing that if he does not win this game his life is most likely over forever and he will be sent with the Monstars to work as a slave at their amusement park. Fourth quarter starts off well for the looney tunes with Jordan scoring ten straight points to give them a three point lead. With the Monstars closing in on the looney tunes with only a few minutes left in the game Jordan decides to call a timeout in order to get his team together and ready for the end of the game. \"I'm really proud of the way everyone is playing lets hold it together till the end of the game and get this win we have a two point lead with only one minute left if we can just play smart and not turn the ball over we are in great shape.\" Exclaimed Jordan nervously with the consequences of losing the game in the back of his mind. \"We will not let you down Michael.\" Says Bugs. The horn blows loudly signaling everyone back onto the court so the game can start back up. Onto the court Jordan and all of the nervous looking looney tunes go. Shortly followed by all the mean faced Monstars mad that they are down two points. The Monstars dribble the ball down court and set up to make a play. Jordan runs over to guard the guy with the ball but is screened hard to the ground and out of the play, on the ground Jordan is looking for a foul that is not called as he watches a three by the Monstars sail right into the bottom of the net. Swish. Monstars make a three with 12 seconds left to take the lead over the looney tunes by one. Jordan gets up a little shaken up from the hit he just took and calls the team's final timeout in order to get a play together for a chance to win the game. \"Bugs you in-bound the ball to me, Taz you set a pick on whoever is guarding me then I will handle the rest from there.\" Yelled Jordan pissed that they were know finding themselves down one. \"Michael are you sure this is going to work\" asked Tweety scared to lose the game and scared to see what happens to Michael afterwards. \"My plans always work\" said Jordan sure that the plan would work. Horn blows signaling that it was time to begin play again. Everybody lines up where Michael told them to line up at. Bugs in bounds the ball to Michael. Michael dribbles a few times waiting on the pick from Taz sure enough with six seconds left on the clock Taz sets a hard pick and frees Jordan up for a shot that he never misses. Jordan rises in the air and releases the ball perfectly like he always does watching the ball sail to the hoop sure that it was nothing but net. CLANK! The ball hits the rim going and out and spinning on the rim a couple times before eventually falling out of the hoop. RIIIINNNGGG! The game clock goes off signaling there is no time left in the game and the Monstars have won by one point. Jordan lays on the floor looking up knowing what the future had in store for him. The looney toons look on knowing what is coming their way and knowing what is about to happen to their hero Michael Jordan. Jordan lays on the floor anxiously waiting for Mr. Swackhammer to come summon him and take him to Moron Mountain where Michael knows he will work as the main attraction at the amusement park with hard and endless days. Mr. Swackhammer: well, well, well Michael Jordan a bet is a bet and you will know have to come with me and become my newest star. Michael: Yes, I know let me say goodbye to a few people before I go because I may never see them again Michael starts off by saying goodbye to the looney tunes, even though they lost the big game Jordan is not mad at them because they all gave everything they have into it. Jordan: I have to go now guys it was a pleasure playing basketball with you I'm sure we will see each other again. Tweety: Michael are you mad at us? Jordan: No Tweety I am not mad at any of you guys, we played an amazing game we just lost to a bunch of cheaters whole stole talent from NBA players. Mr. Swackhammer: TIMES UP. Jordan is summoned to the spaceship by Mr. Swackhammer it is now time to go back to Moron Mountain and start work at the amusement park. First day as the main attraction Michael Jordan cannot stand it, very little time to rest he is constantly entertaining something or someone. He asks Mr. Swackhammer if he can have more time to rest otherwise he won't be able to perform like he has been. Jordan: would it be possible if I got less time entertaining that way I can be fresh for every show. Mr. Swackhammer: Not a Chance! Meanwhile back at looney toons they cannot believe what has happened to Michael Jordan and feel awful about it and feel like it is their fault he is now enslaved at Moron Mountain. Bugs: we got to save Michael. Twister: How are we going to do that? Bugs: I will come up with a plan don't worry. Bugs Bunny stays up all night planning the kidnapping of Michael Jordan. He goes through it over and over again after each plan he doesn't like it and seems like he will never be able to save Michael. Finally after hours and hours of planning it hits him. He comes up with a genius plan that is sure to work. The next morning he meets up with all of the looney toons to pitch the plan to them and see how they feel about it. Bugs: I have a plan to break Michael out of jail. Twister: lets here it bugs. Bugs goes over the plan to break Michael out of Moron Mountain. All of the looney toons agree to the plan and agree to meet up at seven. Tweety: Bugs are you sure this is going to work? Bugs: \"No I'm not sure but we have to get Jordan out of there even if we die trying.\" Later that night the looney toons meet up at the basketball court where they lost the big game at. Bugs: \"twister did you bring the bolt cutters like I told you too?\" Twister: \"Yes sir!\" Bugs: \"Tweety do you have the head bag?\" Tweety: \"yes bugs I brought it.\" The Looney toons set off to their mission to save Jordan the plan is to sneak into Michaels cell when he is sleeping and cutting all the chains he is tied to and kidnap him so even he doesn't know what is going on. Little do the looney toons know that Mr. Swackhammer and the Monstars have traps set up around their star just in case they looney toons were planning to save Michael. The looney toons get to Moron Mountain around midnight it is pitch black out the amusement park just closed and Jordan is fast asleep in his cell. Bugs: okay you guys ready? Twister you are going to sneak into his cell first cut the chains off and I will be right behind you with the head bag we will grab Michael and be out of there in less than a minute. Twister: sounds like a plan boss. The looney toons creep across the pitch black amusement park trying not to wake any of the Monstars or , they are about half way to the cell when the amusement park goes from pitch black too as bright as the sun. Then a booming voice comes over the intercom. : well, well, well look what we have here. The looney toons trying to break out my star attraction. The looney toons knew they were caught and knew there was no way out of this. The monstars come down to the looney toons and grab them and throw them in a cell, each of them in their own cell. Bugs looks out the window into the cell next to his and he sees Michael Jordan laying there beat and tired. Michael looks like he hasn't slept since he's been there. He feels bad that he wasn't able to save him but knows now that Michael isn't alone anymore at Moron Mountain. : here you go Bugs here is your uniform you start tomorrow as my second biggest attraction.

Here we had an alien force stealing the worth and value of our idols, heroes, and celebrities. For America, and Earth entirely, it was a terrifying tragedy. As Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny stood on the sidelines, they watched the Monstars enthusiastically celebrate on their home court logo. The Tune Squad had been defeated. The Monstars romped and raved, while bouncing and dancing like hooligans, utterly rubbing the victory in the Tune Squad's faces. Michael Jordan exclaimed, sadly, to Bugs, \"We should not have lost. This is ridiculous. I've never lost a championship in my life. This was the championship for Earth.\" Bugs just shrugged. The Monstars starting lineup, then consisted of talent from the likes of Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Mugsy Bogues, and Larry Johnson, walked up to the Tune Squad and proudly claimed their victory. The Monstars had only one question for Michael: How do they get into the NBA? Michael regrettably informed the Monstars that they would only need to pass a health physical, be male, and be of legal age to play in the league. Seeing as how the Monstars were each of legal age, that was not a problem. When the next NBA draft was announced, the Monstars entered the draft. The five Monstars were taken as the first five picks, in a sweeping surprise, and there was nothing current NBA players could do to combat the talent and size of the Monstars. They dominated every single game. Every single Monstar averaged a triple double, and the league was becoming an embarrassment. It was truly astonishing that an outside, alien world could potentially be so good at the sport, and league, that humans created. Everywhere in America, folks were terrified that this would be the end of sports and humanity as they knew it. The NBA team that drafted Charles Barkley (in Monstar version), the Seattle Supersonics, ended up winning the NBA championship. Every year following that, the NBA champion was one of the Monstars. That was the case for the next 7 years, and humans were getting sick of it. Not only that, but since the Monstars incredible success, planet Earth had become more and more dense with Nerdlucks (the nationality of the Monstars). The Nerdlucks were truly disgusting individuals. Each of them were dirty, vile, indiscreet, rude, and generally horrible people to be around. At restaurants, the Nerdlucks would disrespect and abuse waitresses, and would fail to tip every single time. In bars, the Nerdlucks would take up all of the room, and be terribly gross. They would blow nauseating snot rockets on the ground, and it seemed humanity was bound for extinction, because in addition to their general gross nature, the Nerdlucks were also absurdly violent. Nerdlucks, on their home planet, saw murder as a way to resolve conflict. That being said, it is very clear that Nerdlucks were commonly killing humans they had disagreements with. Due to their superior size and strength, there wasn't much humans could do to preserve their life. It was sad and, ultimately, humans fell into the mode of desperation. Michael Jordan sat at home in Chicago (and sometimes North Carolina) and watched the saddened nature of the human population on television. He couldn't help but feel that he was somehow responsible for the merciless actions that have taken place on Earth since the Monstars defeated his beloved Tune Squad. He vowed to himself, and to his family, that he would rid Earth of the tenacious Monstars. Following that, Jordan called the Tune Squad to a secret meeting inside his home. Of course, he had to restrict his giant bulldog to the computer room. When the rest of the Tune Squad arrived, they were all very confused. \"What are we doing here, Mike?\", Daffy questioned. \"We're here, in summation, because if humans are going to survive, we have to eliminate the Monstars from participating in the NBA. That is their single strongest grasp on this planet, and we need to eliminate them from competing, and more importantly, we need to eliminate them from this planet.\" The entire Tune Squad lineup agreed that this was a necessity. Humans have dominated and controlled Earth for years. There was no way they were going to allow the Monstars to continue to destroy the great planet and people that they loved. At that moment, Michael Jordan came up with a plan. A plan so brilliant and lovably sacrificial, that it would fall into history forever as the single greatest subtly military plan ever. Michael decided that his talent alone was greater than all of the Monstars' talent combined. The only reason the Monstars had defeated him in the NBA Finals following the big Earth championship game, was because human strength combined with Monstar strength was too great to defeat other teams. He needed the Tunes. He needed his squad. Michael delegated that he and the best superstars in the league split their talent, and allow the higher athletically Tunes (with the exception of Porky, of course) to accumulate and accept their talent. Meanwhile, the Monstars sat in a cold, dark basement (the optimal place for a Nerdluck is both cold and dark, like their hearts) celebrating their dominance over the best league in the entire universe. It was at this moment the Monstars finally realized that they were the most supreme basketball players in the world as we know it. They sat, casually, smoking cigars and playing poker. They laughed their evil, sadistic laughs, but had no idea that they were about to have the toughest professional basketball confrontation that they had ever had. The Monstar version of Mugsy Bogues asked, calmly, \"Who's big blind?\" The Monstar version of Shawn Bradley proudly, almost condescendingly, announced, \"I am. I'm 70 feet, 60 inches tall, I'm always big.\" After Mugsy dealt the cards, the news reporter on television announced, \"Next on channel 8, see how the Tune Squad is plotting to defeat the Monstars and send them back to their planet!\" Upon hearing that, the Monstars simply laughed. There was no way any talent on Earth, or in cartoon world could possibly defeat the talent of the Monstars. They were simply too big, too fast, too strong, too dominant. What they didn't know, is that the Tune Squad had the most perfect plan possible. Michael Jordan had constructed the most effective plan against the Monstars that any human could possibly conjure. One might liken this plan to the Lebron James era of basketball. Yes, he is most certainly the most dynamic player in the world, but without the right pieces in a team game, he has no chance to win a championship against the cream of the crop. That is why Michael's idea to distribute talent was the most successful against the Monstars. The Monstars called a meeting with the Tune Squad, hoping to intimidate them before the big game. The Monstars asked if the Tune Squad really wanted to follow through with this plan of action. Following the meeting, in which the Tune Squad proudly exclaimed their intention to reclaim Earth, the Monstars began to sweat a little. They were worried. After all, they only lost by one point to Michael Jordan's Tune Squad. They had a precise clear reason to be worried. One week later, after terms had been negotiated by Don King himself, the Tune Squad and the Monstars met at center court in Chicago, at the United Center. They shook hands, and by shook, it's clear that the Monstars literally shook the Tune Squad's hands. The Monstars size and strength was entirely unmatched. When the teams stepped on the court, the Monstars had a very strong size advantage. They dominated the first quarter, obliterating the Tune Squad 31-8. It was a teeth clenching display. The Monstars were dunking, shooting, and passing with incredible skill. Nobody on the Tune Squad could compete, not even Bugs Bunny or Michael Jordan, the team's two best players. It looked, at this point, that the Tune Squad and Earth were bound to be forever under the rule of the Monstars, athletically, physically, and personally. Humans everywhere were heartbroken and afraid. The second quarter wasn't much more promising, as the Monstars went into the half with a 62-31 lead. None the less, it seemed as if the humans' life, and the life of the Tune Squad, was over as they knew it. As the Tune Squad sulked into the locker room, both Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan slammed their lockers at the same time. All appeared to be over. They would forever be dominated by the superior athletically Monstars. All hope was lost. It was at that moment, Porky had an idea. He saw his team dehydrated. He saw Bill Murray chugging water. He saw Michael Jordan taking a chug. He saw Bugs flirting with Lola, which meant he was certainly thirsty. Porky knew exactly what he needed to do. He grabbed a few bottles from the fridge, walked them over to the water fountain, and filled them up. Then he wrote \"Kobe's secret stuff\" on them. Michael, having great foresight, knew this was a phenomenal idea. He knew what Porky was doing, but he also had faith in the talent of himself and his teammates. His teammates, however, drank all of the \"secret stuff.\" (Kobe was there, but couldn't play, due to a broken finger). In the second half, the Tune Squad came out aggressively. They were rebounding, scoring, and passing on the champion Monstars as if it was no problem. Soon, they started to cut into the lead the Monstars had, and it was very quick. By the middle of the fourth quarter, they were following the Monstars by a mere 10 points. It was truthfully remarkable to watch. Michael was dunking left and right. Bugs was passing like he never had. Even Porky got a couple of points. Unparalleled events were happening and all of Earth was eagerly, terrifyingly, yet excitedly watching. The Tune Squad had worked their way to being a measly two points behind the Monstars. The score was 118-116. It was a very intense game. There were only six seconds left when Bugs Bunny inbounded the ball to Michael Jordan. As Michael beautifully dribbled the ball down the floor, the entire human race was on its feet. Michael drove to the right side of the court, while Bugs drove the left, without the ball. 4 seconds left. Bill Murray set a screen on the small Mugsy Bogues, who was guarding Bugs, and Bugs was suddenly free. 2 seconds left. Bugs fades to the corner as Michael simultaneously feeds him the basketball. Bugs Bunny has a second to look at the rim, and then he fires. 1 second left. The ball hangs in the air, for what seems like an eternity. It drives further into the air, as the entire stadium, and all of the players look wondrously toward the sky. As the ball reaches its peak, it starts to fall, slowly, surely, toward the basket. Bugs misfired. Bugs misfired, but he misfired perfectly, if ever a thing existed. The basketball bounced off the top-left of the box, and fell delicately into the net. The noise that surrounded and filled the arena cannot be described. It was so true, so loud, so deafening, that everybody in the arena, and everybody within a fifty mile radius, could hear it with crystal clear quality. Michael, Bill and Bugs all raised their hands, in a triumphant defense of their planet. They celebrated on their home court, on their logo, with their fans, and the human race, and human sports, was saved. The End. Following the best game that anybody had ever seen of basketball, the Tune Squad reached unprecedented fame. Bugs Bunny was subsequently endorsed by Nike, with Michael Jordan, and Porky won the Coach-Player of the Year award. Earth was saved. Tune Squad won.

I'm not good at this game!\" Christina called out. Her and the Nerdlucks were passing time by playing a game of hide and go seek. It was always a majority vote of who was it, and they always voted for her. It was always the same, they would change spots during the game, which was cheating, but she couldn't control them. She was out in the hall where she could see everything outside, but was very frustrated. She had been searching for and hour, and she was a good sport for the first forty-five minutes. \"Guys! Give me a sign please! I am very close to giving up.\" Christina called once more. Suddenly, she felt something grabbing her hair and slightly tugging at it. Slowly, she raised her head and saw Bang holding a strand of her brown straight hair, smiling at her. Christina chuckled and helped him down. \"Where are they?\" Christina asked at the little green alien. Suddenly a voice called from above. \"Don't say anything!...shoot!\" Pound's voice called out. Christina smirked and looked up to see all the aliens bashfully looking at her. \"Do you guys need help getting down?\" She asked knowingly. All the aliens nodded, knowing they would be squashed if they jumped from that height. Christina laughed and held out her arms to catch them. Pound went down first, whom she caught with ease. He nodded in appreciation and dropped to the ground. Blanko went next, and gave her a goofy grin. Bupkus gave an army cry and dropped face first into her arms. Then Nawt dropped slowly into her arms, where he gave her a a kiss on the cheek for appreciation. All the aliens then luined up on the floor and faced her with humongous smiles. Suddenly, the familiar bell of Swackhammer calling them sounded, signaling them to go to his office immediately. \"Hey boss, whatcha need?\" Christina asked as they entered his office. The familiar scent of smoke surrounded them as they stepped towards his desk. Swackhammer glared at her signaling that he was very mad and frustrated. \"I will get you a glass of coffee.\" Christina said and walked out of the office towards the kitchen. Who would have thought that an alien planet would have a human kitchen? Well, its human enough. Christina remembered when she first came here. She was two years old. The Nerdlucks were (in their race) seven years old, so they showed her around and adopted her as their baby sister, even if she was a bit bigger then them. Her and Nawt were the youngest, although he was older then her by three years. They had immediately clicked when they met. They shared a lot in common, such as; He and her LOVED running, in fact, they often had races to see who was fastest. He would go in goo form and she would run. Another thing was, they liked to prank Pound, although they got yelled at later. But the thing they loved the most, was to dance. They watched Earth's artists' and singers, and Christina knew how to sing as well. Christina had been dancing with him since they met, which was twelve years! She was fourteen. Her and Bupkus also became good friends as well, because they both loved movies and had the same taste in clothing. Other then that, the others were just overprotective. As Christina poured a cup of coffee, she heard Swackhammer yelling. She hated it when he would yell at her brothers, like they were nothing. He treated them horribly, just because they were less then two feet tall. \"LOONEY! That's it!\" Swackhammer suddenly yelled. He sounded very excited and smug, like he was the king of the universe. Suddenly the Nerdlucks ran out of the room, excited and determined grins on their faces. \"Guys, whats going on?\" Christina asked curiously, her brows furrowed. What was going on, and why were they actually excited? \"Something good!\" Pound said as he passed her.\"Something amazing!\" Bang yelled in excitement. \"Something life changing!\" Nawt squealed, then launched himself into her arms. \"Oh Christina, it is a miracle!\" He nuzzled into her. \"W-what?\" Christina stuttered, very confused. \"Mr. Swackhammer wants us to kidnap the Looney Toons!\" Nawt yelled, looking up at her with wide, overjoyed and innocent eyes. Christina couldn't believe it. If they did this job, they would finally be happy. Mr. Swackhammer would be proud and would reward them with riches, maybe even their freedom! She could picture it in her mind, her and her brothers handing over the Looney Tunes and running away!They could live together as a family! Without any worries! Christina felt something wipe at her lower eyelid, making her look down. All the Nerdlucks surrounded her with concerned faces, while Pound lowered his hand that had just wiped a tear from her face! \"Christina, whats wrong? Aren't you happy?\" Blanko asked with his eyes still all wobbly. Christina looked around and saw all her brothers', they guys who she loved and adored! And they might be able to be a true family! Tears kept falling from her eyes, and she was unable to stop them. A smile of relief and pure happiness spread across her face! \"Yes, I am.\" She whispered, and gathered them in a group hug, showing her love to everyone of them. The Nerdlucks' were shocked at first. Christina had never acted like this before, and this was the first time in seven years that she has cried. Christina was a tough girl, and a major tom-boy, but she had a soft spot for them, though she only showed it when she needed too. Slowly, they hugged back with all they could muster, trying not to cry. They loved her, and would do anything and everything to protect her. It was settled. Tomorrow, they would set out, capture some cartoon characters, and be a, FREE, family. And a happy one at that. ","Summary":" \"Come on guys! I'm not good at this game!\" Christina called out.

Michael turns off the TV. \"That's a damn shame\" he mumbles to Bill. \"Guess they don't make 'em like they used to,\" Bill jokes. Michael gives him a long glare to let him know that it isn't a joking matter. Michael steps out of his front door only to be inquired by the press. \"Mr. Jordan, how do you feel about LeBron James' recent injury?\" each reporter asks using roughly the same words. Michael is silent while Bill answers the reporters' questions. \"Mr. Murray, with all due respect, we don't want to hear what you think;\" one reporter says sternly, \"we want to hear from Michael Jordan\". Michael answers one reporter \"It's a tragic end to a great career. We were all looking forward to what else he could bring to the world of basketball\". In that moment, Michael looks back at his own career, remembering his classic highlights. Headlines that read \"Air Jordan!\" and \"His Airness\" flash through his mind. He would love to relive his glory days, recalling the airy texture of his Bulls jersey and the roaring crowds. \"Michael. Hey, Michael?\" a muffled voice asks. Michael follows the voice to Bill's face. \"You good?\" Bill asks. \"Yeah, let's get out of here\". A tower in the shape of a once honorable business tycoon looms over Moron Mountain. It is occupied still by Swackhammer, who is vengeful after his defeat by Michael and the Looney Tunes. He has aged, as shown by his lumpy green skin that sags and his yellowing teeth & nails. His voice croaks and he uses a cane made from the bones of his former minions. He is swamped by angry shareholders and other executives because of Moron Mountain's dwindling profits and fall in overall appeal to customers. \"I promise you I'll find a way to get back on top\" he tells them. \"Yeah right,\" retorts one executive, \"How are you going to do that? Get the Looney Tunes? Ha!\" Swackhammer shows his ugly grin \"That's exactly what I'm going to do\". Looney Tune Land is as sunny, two dimensional, and cartoon-looking as usual. Typical looney antics ensue by Bugs Bunny and the usual suspects. Since the events of the game with Michael against Swackhammer and the Monstars, the Looney Tunes have neglected their basketball talents, rather focusing on their antics. Suddenly, a rusted, old rocket sputters into Looney Tune Land and lands with a high-pitched screech. The door creeks open and a cane made of bones slams down. An animated green stench escapes from the shadowy figure standing in the rocket doorway. The Looney Tunes immediately pinch their noses and their eyes are bloodshot. The shadowy figure steps out, exhaling his rancid breath. He reveals himself to the Looney Tunes as Swackhammer, their once formidable foe. Bugs and the gang stand in terror. Their thoughts of regret race through their minds, as they remember how they have neglected their basketball skills. This time, Swackhammer comes alone. Bugs and the other Looney Tunes wonder why this is. In the days following the defeat from Michael and the Looney Tunes, Swackhammer's ex-minions were free from their tyrannical leader. Freedom came at a price, however, and they often found themselves starving for food. They would rather have starved to death than go back to their leader, and that's exactly what they did. Later, their bones were discovered and returned to Swackhammer, who subsequently made them into his cane. Bugs and the gang know this time that they cannot underestimate Swackhammer like they underestimated his minions last time. He certainly could have tricks up his sleeve. Swackhammer grabs a megaphone and calls out over all of Looney Tune Land. \"I've come to take you as slaves to work for me on Moron Mountain,\" he yells. Bugs Bunny yawns. The other Looney Tunes laugh. \"You don't have any new ideas?\" Daffy Duck yells, his beak spraying saliva as he speaks. Swackhammer pulls out the basketball that his old minions used to absorb the talents from the old NBA players. \"This basketball contains the talents of the five best basketball players in the league today\". He then places him palms on the ball and grows to a height unimaginable even by Looney Tunes standards. The Looney Tunes comply and proceed to line up into the rocket. Luckily, Bugs burrowed into the ground, holding the used-up magical basketball. Swackhammer didn't realize that he was gone. Since the day he lost his ability to walk, LeBron James' mind has slowly deteriorated as well. He feels that he has nothing to live for, but at the same time feels that he has let down everyone. He looks up at his framed Jordan jersey and sobs. He knows now that he'll never be anything compared to him. As much as it pains him to watch, he can't himself to turning on the TV to ESPN to check out how the other NBA players are doing. Montage after montage of players such as Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant falling over and acting clumsy. \"This phenomenon is oddly reminiscent of the '95 season, in which Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and others fell over in their clumsiness,\" the reporter announces. \"What the hell is going on?\" LeBron asks himself. Michael and Bill are hanging out at Michael's mansion shooting hoops and discussing basketball. \"I guess you're still the best of all time,\" Bill Murray teases. \"Did you hear about the bug going around? It's affecting all the star players in the NBA.\" Michael rolls his eyes, \"Not the first time. I'll believe just about anything nowadays.\" All of the sudden, the court begins to shake. Michael and Bill lose their balance, falling to the ground. In an instant, Bugs Bunny explodes from the middle of the court. He had dug his way to Michael's mansion from Looney Tune Land. Michael jumps from the ground in shock. He hadn't seen Bugs in years, \"Bugs Bunny, well aren't you a sight for sore eyes!\" Bugs catches his breath and drops the magic basketball to the ground. It rolls to Bill's feet. Bill picks up the ball and asks, \"What is it this time?\" Bugs is frantic, pacing back and forth. He can't seem to put what just happened into words. Michael stops Bugs, and shakes him into reality. A cartoonish slap finally brings Bugs back to his senses. Bugs quickly informs Michael of all the details. He even describes Swackhammer's rancid breath. \"…and it smelled like ass on a hot summer day.\" Michael was horrified by Bug's description of both Swackhammer's breath and the impending doom of the Looney Tunes. \"I think I might, perhaps, possibly have a solution,\" Michael grins. Michael, Bugs, and Bill exit Michael's sports car, and look up at LeBron's mansion. They ring the doorbell, and anxiously wait for an answer. A butler answers the door, and leads the group inside. LeBron rolls into the room, and screeches to a halt. He cannot believe his eyes. His personal hero, in the flesh. Michael asks, \"Would you like to assist us? We need your skills.\" LeBron James replies, \"Have you not seen the news lately? I'm finished. Paralyzed.\" \"Don't you know anything about basketball? It runs in our blood. We don't have to play the game to have skills. Your skills come from your heart.\" LeBron really didn't understand what the fuck Michael was talking about, but he figured if the man came all the way to see him, he really needed his help. Michael takes out the magic ball. \"We need your talent. There is only one way we can save the Looney Tunes.\" Resting their hands on the ball, Michael and LeBron transfer their basketball talent into the magic ball. Bill Murray then takes the ball, and absorbs their talent. They are all set to take on Swackhammer. Bugs takes everyone underground by burrowing back into the ground, between dimensions into Looney Tune Land. It's a difficult journey, but they all make it, talent intact. To get to Moron Mountain, they take an interstellar rocket created by Marvin the Martian. Once on Moron Mountain, Swackhammer immediately senses their presence. He has his new Looney Tunes minions seize them and bring them to his chambers. In Swackhammer's chambers, there are Looney Tunes working constantly. Moron Mountain is as efficient and profitable as ever. When Michael, Bill, LeBron, and Bugs are brought into his chambers, Swackhammer begins to cackle. \"I never thought I'd see your face again,\" he taunts Michael. \"We have another bet to make,\" Bill Murray says. \"1 on 1 match me vs. you, 21 points\" Bill offers, \"If I win, we get the looney tunes back. If you win, you get all of us here to work for you\". Swackhammer cackles even louder. He can't believe Bill's proposition. \"I accept your challenge,\" he says with a wide grin. Suddenly, a court rises up out of Moron Mountain, and Swackhammer & Bill Murray find themselves wearing their respective uniforms. \"Space Jam\" by Quad City DJ's echoes over the loudspeakers. \"Everybody get up up up up up up…\" Swackhammer towers over Bill. The game is fact paced, getting to 10-10 within 30 seconds. Swackhammer can't believe the game is his evenly matched, so he throws some elbows into Bill behind the ref's back. Bill is down for the count until Bugs revives him with some of Michael's secret stuff. Bill Murray comes back and scores 11 unanswered points to win the game. Swackhammer shrinks to normal size in defeat. Bill Murray has finally proven what it takes to be taken seriously as a basketball player. The Looney Tunes are free. Bill Murray decides to stay in Looney Tune Land with Bugs and help the Looney Tunes with their basketball fundamentals so they can protect themselves from Swackhammer. Michael and LeBron travel back to Earth and start the beginning of a life-long friendship. \"I Believe I Can Fly\" by R Kelly is playing in the background.

It was an excellent battle for the UBA (Unisex Basketball Association) Championship. The Charlotte Wildcats defeated The Anaheim Quack Attack in a Game 7 battle. He was happy. A 5 straight time UBA Champion with the Wildcats and his first team, The Charlotte Dragons, 2 time MVP, The Sixth Player of the Year in his rookie year, 2 time Slam Dunk Champion, 5 time All Star Captain, and a 5 time Championship and All Star MVP. But with another championship win for his city, he was sad as he kept on shooting. Tonight was the last time he will be in the UBA. \"Yo, Russ.\" Russell shot the ball and made it before turning to see his brother and some of his teammates behind him. \"You'll be late to the party, man. You coming?\" Scottie, his brother asked. \"Yeah, I'll be there. I thought I have one last shootaround on the court.\" \"Great memories you made not just on this court, but others, Captain\" Kenzie told Russell, as he bounce the ball between his legs. Jared wrapped his arm around his former Captain. \"Yeah man. Who could forget the rivalry between Charlotte Dragons and Los Angeles Legends for three straight years. Two of them you shot the buzzer beater.\" \"Why did you think I left them? I couldn't go back to LA for another championship battle haha.\" \"The battle against New Orleans. The Voodoo fans hated you and you made sure they wouldn't forget your name\" said Kenzie. \"The day The Villain was born. But I couldn't do it alone. I had teammates with me.

Russell shot the ball and it circled around the rim, rolling out. \"Nope.\" Jared tried to figure out his friend. \"You're thinking about the NBA? Going to help out your Bobcats? \"As much as I want to...\" Russell shot the ball, bouncing it off the backboard. \"I'm not going to the NBA.\" \"Well wherever he goes, I believe his teammates, the fans, and Charlotte will support him in his decision\" said Scottie, smiling at his brother. \"I'm jealous your brother wrestled for the WWE. That had to be awesome\" Jared said. Scottie smirked. \"It was fine, you guys. I would try to make it to your games and try not to miss any moments.\" \"Its okay, Scottie. You didn't miss any.\" \"Well, except one...The Dunk.\" Russell drop the basketball when he heard the sentence. \"Woah, Scottie.

His wall of televisions were broken except for one that was showing two bunnies walking up the steps of a building with Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny statues on the side of the steps. \"Acme University...huh\" a toothy grin form as he paid attention to the screen, curiosity taking over the business alien. --Acme University, Looney Toon Land-- It was gym time for the students of Acme University. Being that it was Friday, it was the favorite sport of the day. \"DODGEPIE!\" Elmer Fudd yelled out, blowing the whistle to start the game. Students grouped of four ran to the center court, picking up whipped cream pies and start throwing them across the gym. Fowlmouth was the first one out of the game for Team Buster. \"Oh [Car crashes] [Explosions, mother [Airhorns] [Cars honking]\" [Meanwhile in the classroom] Principle Bugs Bunny watched Wile E Coyote bandage himself ]pi injured from chasing after RoadRunner. \"Wile, what did I tell you about using our explosives towards our staff members without my permission?\" Wile showed Bugs a pickup sign, saying sorry. \"Anyway, get yourself patched up. We're going to The Nerdlucks' homecoming party. Daffy and Foghorn are almost done setting it up.\" The coyote gave the principle a thumbs up, only for his arm to fall off. -- Buster Bunny and Plucky Duck were left on the boys team as Babs Bunny (No relation)and Shirley McLoon. Plucky threw a pie at the ladies. Shirley, who was hovering a inch of the floor, didn't dodge the pie. It circled around her in her orbit and was threw back to Plucky. The pie spinned around the duck, causing him the twist around. The pie stopped as Plucky stop spinning, dizzy and was hit in the face. \"Plucky, out!\" said Elmur. \"C'mon Buster, you got this!\" Hampton cheered on. Buster focused on the two ladies. Shirley was surround by pies, circling around her, handing Babs to throw. The blue bunny dodged the attacks, trying to find an opening to the gals. Buster slam a hole on the court, digging to the other side. \"Babs, like where did he go?\" Shirley asked her partner. \"I'm here ladies\" said Buster, behind them. The two turn and receive a pie in the face. \"Boys win!\" Elmur called out, blowing the whistle. The boys team cheered, carrying Buster on their shoulders. They never defeat the girl's team thanks to their heavy hitters Shirley and Babs. But now, Buster was the hero. \"Buster, I want you here for detention to fix the floor!\" Fudd said. Buster frown for a bit, but he couldn't keep the smile on his face. \"Hey Elmur, let the kid off.\" The former hunter turn to see Bugs, eating an carrot. \"Bugs, look at the hole he made on the court.\" \"It'll be okay. Taz can fix tomorrow. He made history for the boys. So lets him go and celebrate with his friends.\" \"You're right...\" said Elmur, looking at the girls team shaking hands with Buster. \"Speaking of friends, the homecoming party is ready.

The Monstars were about to head to the living room to watch TV.\"Hey Pound! Bupkus,Bang, Nawt, and I are heading to the living room to watch TV. You wanna join us?\" asked Blanko. Pound replied,\" You guys go on without me. I gotta do something in my room first.\" When Pound went upstairs and locked himself in his room, the four Monstars looked at each other and shrugged. \"Oh well, more TV for us.\" said Bupkus . The four of them went to the living room. An hour later, Pound unlocked his door and heads out of his room. Suddenly, his stomach started to rumble. \"Man I'm hungry.\" he thought, \"Looks like watching TV with the gang will have to wait.\" As he went downstairs, Bupkus,Bang,Blanko, and Nawt noticed their orange friend was heading to the front door. Bang went first and asked \"Yo Pound, where are you heading to?\" Pound turned to his friends around replied, \"Guys, I'm going out to run a quick errand.\" \"What type of errand do you mean?\" asked Nawt.\"Well for one,I noticed that our house is a little low of food, so I'm going to the Supermarket.\" Pound responded. \"No kidding.\" Bupkus added, \"The only things we have to eat is baby carrots, corn, and potatoes.\" \"Dude,I know right?\" Blanko agreed in disgust, \"I know we're supposed to eat healthy, but there is no way we're eating all those vegetables for the next two weeks.\" \"We're men,we eat meat too.\" Bupkus added. \"Well that's what I'm going to do.I'll see you guys when I get back.\" Pound said to his team as he leaves the house and closed the front door to drive in his car. Pound went inside the car and drove away. It was only a minute after Pound left for the store and the four Monstars were wondering what he does in his room every afternoon. \"What do you guys think Pound does in his room?\" asked Blanko. Bang replied, \"I don't know but whatever it is, it's gotta be something top secret.\" The guys agreed with Bang by nodding their heads. \"Maybe we can ask Pound what he does in room all the time once he gets back.\" Nawt suggested. The gang felt unsure about that idea, even Bupkus. \"Nah, even if we asked him nicely he probably still wouldn't tell us.\"He disagreed. Then suddenly, Bang had an idea! \"If we can't ask Pound what he does while he's locked up in his room every day, we'll just have to find out for ourselves.\" he said, \"But first, we gotta find out what type of secret he's hiding in his room.\" Bupkus,Blanko, and Nawt on the other hand were reluctant about Bang's idea. \"I don't think that's such a good idea Bang.\" Bupkus reasoned with Bang. Bang asked Bupkus,\"Why not?\" \"It's just that, snooping in Pound's room is an invasion of his privacy.\" Bupkus explained. \"He's got a point Bang.\" Nawt agreed. \"C'mon you guys.\" Bang said, \"We'll make it quick before Pound gets back home.\" \"Are you sure this is a good idea Bang?\" Blanko asked. \"I'm positive.\" Bang said. Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt did some thinking for a bit and decided to go with Bang's plan. \"Ok, we'll make it quick before Pound gets back home.\" said Bupkus. \"Alright! Let's do this!\" Bang told the others.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The four Monstars went upstairs to Pound's room to find out what he does in his room every day. \"Bang, how are we supposed to know what Pound is hiding?\" Bupkus asked. \"Yeah, one of his hidden secrets could be hiding anywhere.\" Blanko added.\"We'll just have try until we find some.\" said Bang. The gang split up to find out what Pound is hiding. Bupkus crouched down to looked under Pound's bed,but couldn't find anything. He got up and said, \"Nothing under the bed.\" Next, Nawt zipped to Pound's dresser and looked in drawer. \"Nothing in here either!\" said Nawt. While Bang, Bupkus, and Nawt kept looking, Blanko opened the closet to look what Pound is hiding all of sudden, a book fell from the top shelf, bonked him on the head and then landed on the floor. \"Ow!\" he groaned while rubbing his head in pain. Blanko turned around and noticed something strange. It was a weird journal that hit him. He picked it up and called out to Bupkus,Bang, and Nawt, \"Hey dudes! I found a journal!\" The three of them stopped looking and went straight to Blanko. \"This must Pound's journal where he writes down his inner thoughts.\" said, Bupkus. This must be the reason why Pound locks himself in his room all the time.\" Blanko explained. Bang was curious of what was written in Pound's journal. \"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's read it!\" he told the others. Before Blanko opened the book, Blanko tries to reason with Bang. \"You know dude, Bupkus is right. We shouldn't do this because it's an invasion of Pound's Privacy just like Bupkus said.\" Nawt agreed with Blanko, \"Blanko's right. Reading Pound's journal doesn't feel right. He's our friend.\" \"Yeah Bang.\" said Bupkus, \"We're starting to have second thoughts about snooping in his room.\" \"C'mon you guys.\" Bang said, \"Like I said before, I promise this will be quick. Once we read his journal for a bit we can leave before he gets back.\" Bupkus,Blanko, and Nawt sighed and decided to read Pound's journal. \"Fine let's do it.\" Bupkus said. Blanko opened the journal and read the first page.

His hands are fisted in the hem of his sister's best church dress, bought for Christmas that past year, the red one with the sweet little gold bows. The Mary Janes to match aren't on his feet, though. Too big for them, certainly; his feet have gone up two sizes in the last year alone. He's due a growth spurt, else he's going to mature into a very strangely proportioned young man. There is red lipstick on his lips. The little tube sits on his nightstand, rolled onto its side. Mrs. Caffrey feels detached, as if her brain has somehow floated off from the rest of her. She hears the doorknob squeak as if it is somewhere far away, perhaps still with her body. When she looks down to inspect it, she sees that her knuckles have gone white. She relaxes her grip. \"I…\" she starts and has to try again, \"I—hmm.\" Her mouth opens once, then twice, soundlessly, before she closes it again. Abruptly she lifts a single finger, \"wait.\" \"Now look up.\" Michael obeys. She swipes the mascara wand across the underside of his lashes. She feels more grounded now, more present, but her thoughts are giddy, ludicrous. What am I doing? Why am I doing this? He makes for a lovely girl . And it's true. Prettier than she had been at that age, all frumpy hair and big glasses and too-bright wrong-color eyeshadow, applied in secret in the girls' toilet at school. Glasses are nicer nowadays. There's hardly any shame in wearing them at all, now. \"You take off that lipstick,\" she orders him, passing him a tissue dipped in cold cream. She is aiming for a stern tone and not quite managing it. \"That one is much too grown up.\" She reaches into her makeup bag, fingers flick over the options, before selecting a mauve which will flatter his skin. Her son's lips are parted as she applies it for him, gaze too intense and curious to meet. \"There,\" Mrs. Caffrey says, unnaturally cheery. She holds his chin between her thumb and forefinger and turns his face toward the mirror. Michael makes as if to touch his skin, the blush swept over his cheekbone, and she halts his hand's progress. \"Don't touch your face. You'll be getting pimples soon enough. No need to hurry them along.\" \"Thanks.\" His voice is tight. \"Don't,\" be afraid . Ever hide. Be like your dad, \"mention it,\" she finishes stupidly, still strange and bright, as if she were selling oven cleaner in an advertisement. She busies herself with gathering her makeup back into the bag and heads back to the doorway, footsteps light. She can feel Michael's eyes on her back.

Sometimes he would think he had, and sometimes it would feel like he had. But every year, when Christmas rolled around, he would realize he hadn't. And always would it make him feel pathetic. At 11:00 PM, Michael and Billy were sat on the roof. Their roof. The snow was piled on top the roof and caved in just enough to make the roof seem round instead of flat and the long, sharp icicles clinging on to the edge of the building almost looked like it belonged in a children's fantasy book. Michael had cleared out a small section in snow, just big enough for the both of them to sit on. The air was chilly, like how air got around Christmas. Neither of them knew or quite frankly, bothered asking why they were sat outside in such cold weather. They just they did. Like they do. Amongst them was a sort of comforting silence that only the two of them could share. Enjoying each other's presence and looking over the view of the cloudy night sky. A full moon was out that night but it was hidden among the dark clouds. Michael thought it was like the moon was hiding it was glimmer behind the dullness of everything around it. Billy had noticed how peaceful his village was compared to London. He loved London. It always felt like he had something to do, or somewhere to be. Everything was in it's place and that was nice. But he never realized how much he missed his peaceful and quiet town of Everington. Something his new fourteen-year old self came to appreciate. Billy then broke the silence. With a question. \"Have you been practicing?\" \"Practicing what?\" \"Ballet.\" Michael was surprised. He didn't know it was a thing Billy wanted him to practice. But he did. Oh, of course he did. Memories of all the times he would try practicing after billy left came flooding back into his mind. All the times he would sneak into the gym and pretend that Billy was there with him. Teaching him. Dancing with him. All the times he would review what Billy Taught him in his head, only to end up on the ground in a loud, painful thud. And that one time when he realized that it was meaningless without the company of his best mate. His dancer boy. \"No.\" Michael answered. That was a lie. \"Well, do you remember anything at all?\" \"No.\" That was also a lie. He remembered everything. How could he not? Billy smirked. He still had that goofy, lopsided smile that Michael thought made Billy's whole face light up. And it never failed to make His heart skip a beat. Billy grabbed both of Michael's hands. \"C'mon!\" He said, before letting go of his right hand and pulling him by the left. Off the roof and toward the road. Michael's heart fluttered at the feeling of Billy's hand in his. He knew where Billy was taking him. Not letting go of Michael's hand, Billy lead him on a path. An all too familiar path. Through the left road, under the bridge, and left at the two tall willow trees. When they arrived, they took a minute to just stand there, looking at the old white and blue building. It was exactly how Billy left it. The walls, run down and the red paint slowly peeling off the door. It wasn't fancy like the gyms he had had at the school but it was definitely his favourite because, it was home. And, as Mrs. Wilkinson said, It's where his life had began. \"Ya know, they're go'n to take down this gym and build a new one.\" Michael spoke, eyes still fixed on the gym. \"Aye, I heard it from me dad.\" Michael could hear the sadness in his voice. \"You alright?\" Michael asked sounding more concerned than he had intended. \"Yeh. It's just...I'll miss this place.\" Billy squeezed Michael's hand and his heart leapt again. \"yeh.\" Michael agreed. \"My life began inside these walls, ya know'.\" \"you sound like a right old woman.\" Michael joked. \"Bugger off!\" Billy retorted. They both laugh, realizing that It had been ages since they last laughed together. Like ages since they last had the chance to. \"C'mon then!\" Billy said, pulling Michael through the old, squeaky red door. \"Best use most of the time the place still got left.\" The gym was dark. They tiniest bit of light soaked in through the windows but it wasn't enough to light the place. They could hear the howling of the chimney when the cold winter wind blew over it, sounding like when someone would blow into a beer bottle. To Michael the gym always felt scary at night. Not that he was afraid of ghost or monsters, although he would be lying if the thought of them never escaped his mind. No, it was because when it was dark, he felt alone. And he hated being alone. Darkness was his loneliness and loneliness was his darkness. But those nights, when he and Billy would escape to the gym, were the only nights he had never felt scared. Always, safe. Protected. Billy always made him feel safe and protected. Stupid, huh? The gym was dirtier than when Billy had last been there. Tools and equipment were lined up against the wall probably in preparation for the rebuilding. The ground was littered in sawdust and wood. However despite of all the mess, the ballet and boxing equipment still remained, which made Billy happy. \"God, it's even more cold in here than outside.\" Billy shivered putting his cold hands into the each of his opposite sleeves like a Chinese emperor. Michael loved it when he did that. \"You Want me to warm your hands again don't you, dancer boy?\" \"Only if you dance with me afterwards.\" \"Oi! you coming or not?\" Billy called from the boxing ring. \"Aye!\" Michael answered. \"Right, lets start at the beginning.\" Billy said. \"Aye.\" Michael croaked. \"Did your voice just crack?\" \"No!\" \" Plei. First\" Billy's hand was touching his. \" Second\" Billy slid his hands down his arms. \" Third\" He could feel Billy getting closer. \" Fourth\" He watched as Billy leaned in towards his cheek. \" Fith\" Billy Kissed him. \" Fin\" Everything went silent. Thoughts ran through each of their minds but neither of them knew what to say or dared risk speaking in fear how the other might respond. Finally Michael spoke. \"Billy. Please... don't do that again.\" Michael whispered in a almost inaudible voice. \"What? Why?!\" Maybe that wasn't the right thing to say but it was all that Billy could think of after being sure his friend would have liked it. \"You can't keep on doing this to me.\" Michael stood up eyes, voice brittle and eyes pointed to the ground. Billy could tell he was crying. \"What you on about?\" Michael turned around to face Billy and for the first time in two years, made eye contact. Billy could see the tears in Michael's normally bright and cheerful green eyes. He hated that. \"Keep kissing me, and holding my hand, and making me fall in love with you. I know you ain't a poof and I know you'll never like me so stop...stop giving me hope. Michael's voice rose sounding more angry. \"Do you have any idea how many nights I've spent, staying awake just thinking about that bloody kiss, and how much nights I've spent, cry' in myself to sleep because I know you'll never like me?\" Michael choked. \"You know I like you but, it doesn't mean you can to keep play' in with me like that.\" Michael's voice became quiet again. \"Okay?\" Billy was silent. \"Look, I have to go.\" And just like that, Michael was gone. Leaving Billy. There. Alone. At 11:30 PM, Billy found Michael. He was huddled against the shabby old metal wall near their houses. He knew he would find Michael there. The wall was there for as long as either of them known and it only seemed to get in worse condition each year. But even so, the two would always sit there if they were feeling angry or upset and the other would sit alongside them, just to provide comfort. They had done it ever since they could remember. It was their thing. \"Hey.\" Billy said as he walked up and stopped beside Michael putting his body against the wall. \"Hi.\" Michael replied. His voice was quiet and brittle and Billy knew he had been crying a lot. Billy knew not to say anything. Michael just wanted to think. So Billy let him. Twenty minutes later, Billy spoke again. \"You know you're being a complete idiot, right?\" Billy began. Michael didn't reply so Billy continued. \"Do you know why I kissed you, that day before I left?\" Billy asked, eyes pointed towards the night sky. That question surprised Michael to say the least. He would be lying if he said he hadn't gone over that question a million times in his head before. Each time he would come to the conclusion that Billy was only being nice and that was it. It didn't mean anything. Nothing at all. \"I don't know.\" Michael responded \"to be nice?\" \"No. You think I go around kissing everyone to be nice?\" \"Then why, Billy? Because you pity me?\" \"For Christ sake Michael. Don't be such a divvy. I bloody kissed you. What else do you think it could have meant?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Jesus, you'd think that the whole kissing you thing would get the message across, huh?\" \"What message?\" \"So, you're really going to make me say it.\" \"Say what? \"Christ. I-\" Billy paused uncertain of what to say. Sure he had gone over what to say to Michael tons of times. But when the moment actually came, Billy found it so ironic that mind went a blank. So it was no surprise when he ended up saying this. \"Oh fuck it Michael, I bloody like you, alright?\"` Michael was frozen. ' What did he just say? He liked me? No, he couldn't. ' Michael half convinced himself that Billy hadn't just said that. He was only hearing what he wanted to hear. Billy wasn't a poof...right? But when Michael looked up, he saw a confirmation to Billy's declaration. Billy's face was sheepish and red and he could tell he was trying his best to hide it. But Michael noticed. It was adorable. He had never seen Billy blush before. \"B-but you aren't- you said you ain't a poof.\" \"Fucking hell, I thought kissing you would have been a good nouf' indicator.\" At 12:00 AM, Michael felt a soft pair of lips on his and he knew that he didn't have anything to worry about. He'd Never have to worry about feeling the pain in loving someone who would never love you back. Because Billy liked him. And he liked Billy. And for Michael, that was all that mattered. \"Who's the bloody poof now.\" \"Shut up, Caffery.\" \"I love you, Elliot\" \"I know.\" just a shitty after story to billy elliot the movie. I also want to note that the phrase A \"confirmation to his declaration\" is not mines. It was taken from an excellent Billy Elliot Fan fiction which I cannot remember.

You promised you wouldn't make it hard for me to leave. You promised!\" \"Well, I should not'a made tha' promise, 'cause I can' just let'cha fuckin' leave!\" \"Watch your language!\" she snapped, before sighing. \"Why should I do tha'? You're leavin'. No sense in me watchin' my language.\" \"I told you. You're not just doing it for me. You're doing it for- damn you Elliot! Stop getting me off on tangents!\" He just gave her a weak smile. \"I have ta' try sometin', don' I?\" The smile she gave him was just as weak. They both turned when the bus pulled in. \"Please don' do this Amy. Please.\" \"Elliot, I'm getting on that bus and I am going back to London. I've been here too long as it is.\" \"Yer the one who wanted to stay longer remember?\" \"They're calling my bus now. I have to go.\" If her mouth hadn't trembled at that point, he might have let her off without any trouble. But her mouth did tremble and her eyes did happen to get glassy, so he did the only thing he could at that point. He pulled her as close as he dared and amid the bustle of everything at the bus station, he gave her a kiss that he hoped would be enough to last him until he saw her again. To possibly last him forever. She willingly kissed him back at first, but then wrenched herself away. \"Please don't do that to me, please,\" she whimpered, partially pulling away from his embrace. \"If yer goin' ta leave me, a'least give me one ta last me for the twenty years or so.\" \"You'll forget me. You don't need twenty years. Five at the most Elliot and don't you try to contradict me,\" she paused and looked at the ground one last time. \"I'll miss you. You do know that, don't you? I will miss you Tony.\" \"Yeah, you'll probably find some propah city bloke.\" \"No Tony…well, at least not one who can match you in making eggs and toast.\" He gave her a fraction of a smile for that one. \"Bus is leavin' now miss!\" the driver yelled over. \"I'm coming!\" she shouted back before turning back to Tony. \"Tell the kid hello fer us, and that we miss 'im.\" \"I will Tony, I will. Tony?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You need to know-I need you to believe me when I say that I love you,\" she said desperately holding his face in her hands as he looked away scoffing lightly. \"I do! I love you, and no matter where I go or what I do or whomever I become Tony, You will always have part of my heart.\" \"Yeah, remember that when yer gettin' married to yer puff dancer of a husband.\" \"I will Tony, I always will, but even if he can dance, he won't old a flame to you.\" \"Miss, I can' wait any longer!\" the driver yelled again. She pulled him in for one last desperate hug before kissing his cheek, whispering a teary, \"I love you,\" and ran on to the bus, whipping her cheeks furiously. Tony followed the bus as it left and she gave him one last teary look over her shoulder. \"I love you!\" he shouted after the bus. She nodded and blew him a kiss before turning away from him. So Tony Elliot was left standing in the bus station parking lot looking just as or even more so lost as when Billy left. \"Stupid ballet dancers,\" he muttered furiously, before kicking a rock, and walking out of the station, whiping tears. I've never done a Billy Elliot story before but when I was a kid I always had a major crush on Tony (don't ask me why) and I was watching this film the other day and had time to spare. To clear some things up, yes, Amy is a ballet dancer and met Tony through Billy. If people want a story giving that background I would be more than willing to write it. I'm sorry if Tony's accent (in writing) is bad. I decided to take a stab at it because it brings more of his voice into the story but if it doesn't make any sense or is incorrect in any way let me know so I can change it! This itself is a oneshot but if people would like me too I can add more to it. I will warn however that I am a horrible updater and am sticking to oneshots for the time being. P.S. If you didn't figure this out already, I don't own Billy Elliot in any way shape or form.

I feel I have better hold of the characters than I did before. If you like it please review, if you don't . . . wellllllll . . . please review. Doesn't matter, really! :) ---- Somehow I felt like Billy was getting smarter everyday—like some bloody teacher. He was only dancing, and that shouldn't have affected anything really besides his physical body . . . but presently he was making me feel very stupid. Which made me feel stupid. Maybe because I was. \"Michael!\" Billy didn't look too happy. \"Yes, Billy?\" \"What are you doin'!\" I looked at the toothpaste squirted all into a delicate, swirling pattern in the sink. Sure, it was Billy's house and maybe I oughtn't have done it, but I thought it looked quite pretty. Billy didn't seem to think so, and I felt like some naughty puppy. . . . \"Um. . . .\" I smiled innocently at Billy, who could only but stare at the sink . . . like he'd forgotten his mind somewhere. He quickly found it, though. \"Michael, if me Dad sees this he'll give me a right beating!\" Billy started pawing out the toothpaste in large handfuls and tossing it in the rubbish bin. I carefully wiped my hands on a white towel that hung nearby. It was white, too; I hoped it wouldn't show through. \"I'll have to go buy more now!\" He spun around, then focused on me. \"And you're comin' with me.\" I didn't hardly understand. Normal people kept more than one tub of paste in their toilet. But then, Billy's family had always been peculiar—of course I couldn't say mine wasn't. We were just all one big mess of \"peculiar\"s stuck inside some peculiar strike, weren't we? I stared at Billy. \"Why?\" I asked quickly. \"Because you got me into this!\" Billy grabbed my quite lanky upper arm with strong, tight fingers. It made my heart beat a little faster just to think he was touching me, but I fought to shut it up. After all, it was only on the arm. I was frankly surprised he even dared to venture two feet into my personal space—after the whole \"kiss\" incident. I had figured there would be a very profound bubble of space between us at all times. I had obviously figured wrong. Suddenly, I remembered something. \"But I gotta get home before me dad does—!\" Billy rolled his eyes and veered us toward his front door, through the kitchen where normally his father and brother Tony would have been eating or aught, if they hadn't been out traipsing around for the good of the strike, of course. Today they happened to be doing just that, and the only sound was the tap of our footsteps and that of my own bloody heartbeat still fluttering from Billy's slight touch. I hoped he couldn't hear. Outside he finally let go and shoved his hands into his pockets, not even daring to say what I knew he was thinking. His hands were cold, but of course he didn't want a repeat offense of that one night on Christmas day. The event was still fresh in our minds, and we both made a silent vow not to revisit it . . . which I was quite content to break. Feeling quite daring, I slipped my hand into his pocket carefully and squeezed his bare hand, pulling it out into the open. Christ, it was freezing, and I tightened my grip. Billy obviously didn't have very good circulation. I scooted closer as we walked. Billy stopped walking and stared at me funny. I knew once more what he was thinking, but I didn't say anything. I took off my scarf, wrapped it around his hands and muttered for him to hold it, then let go. Billy didn't take his stiff gaze off of me. Then, with a quick nod, I tore off down the snowy streets, took one left, then pushed my way into the pharmacy. \"How much for a tub of this here paste?\" I set the tube on the counter. It was the same toothpaste Billy had had at his house. The woman gave one look at me and said, \"Two pound, twenty.\" \"That's murder,\" I said, bewildered. \"Gimme the money, lad, or be on your merry way,\" she said irritably. A cloud of smoke filled my face as she blew out, the cigarette she'd been smoking held idly in her left hand. \"Fine, but it's a damned lot for paste that cleans your teeth!\" I tossed a two pound coin and twenty pence on the counter, took the toothpaste, a went quite well 'on my merry way'. People bugged me, but never Billy. Almost never. Others did, because they were stupid. Others did, because they didn't understand. Not my Billy. Billy was still waiting for me. \"Here, take your toothpaste.\" I threw it at him. \"Cost me a fortune—basically all I had. Think of it as a present.\" I adjusted my coat, and when I looked up Billy had put the toothpaste away. Where, only God knew. \"Thanks,\" he said, and suddenly grinned. \"You're welcome. . . . Now give us a hand.\" I held mine out. \"You owe me.\" For a moment, Billy was quiet, then he put his own hand out. I grabbed it, smiled, he returned the favor, and we walked home like that. ---- Michael=Love. ","Summary":" Just seen the musical--got inspiration to write more Billy Elliot.

After two years at the Royal Ballet School, Billy was maturing into one of London's most promising ballet prodigies. Billy was whisked from ballet to ballet, premiere to premiere, every night by his overbearing headmistress, Mrs. Everard. He was already being approached by ballet companies, agents, movie stars, and the like, who all saw endless, untapped potential. But, in the midst of Billy's highflying life, he was still a normal boy. At school, Billy was surrounded by friends, both girls and boys. Billy never forgot about Michael, still writing to him at times, but only when he was troubled. Billy was not a poof, although he had been approached by boys at the Ballet School. Billy had never been kissed by anyone, but kissing boys just was not as attractive a thought as kissing girls was. That was the way things were supposed to be, after all, right? Billy was sitting in the lounge of his dormitory, lying on the couch, contemplating his life, preparing for the upcoming school year, when his best mate, Jeremy, sat down next to him. \"Oi! Billy! What're you doing? You've noticed that you're absolutely the only one left in the dorm? Everyone is enjoying their last moments of freedom, and you-\" \"Jeremy, shut your trap! I just finished conditioning, because I actually want to survive the first day of Delacroix,\" said Billy, \"by the way, don't even think about borrowing my Advil when you're close to death.\" finished Billy. Jeremy rolled his eyes. \"You're a right downer, you are,\" said Jeremy, \"if you won't get up for my pleas, at least get up for Marissa Stevens'.\" finished Jeremy. \"She wants to see you, you know.\" It was Billy's turn to roll his eyes. There was no girl at the school that caught his eye, he was only fourteen, for Pete's sake! \"Don't try to set me up with anyone, let alone that gargoyle!\" said Billy. \"Oh, come on, man! She's not that bad,\" said Jeremy, \"Get some good snogs out of it, at least.\" \"Is that all you ever think about? Forget it, I'm going to bed.\" said Billy. \"Alright, pal. Just think about the wonderful opportunities you're missing out on!\" All that could be heard was the slam of a door as Billy attempted to go to sleep before Jeremy could come in and finish the conversation. English was the most boring, boring, FRUSTRATING class for Billy. Nothing ever happened, and Billy had particularly bad grammar. The only bright side of this class was the teacher, Mr. Graham. \"Billy,\" whispered Jeremy, leaning forward in his desk to whisper in Billy's ear, \"Do you think Graham is even better in class because he finally got a bird in bed with him?\" \"If we weren't in class, I would punch you. You realize that, right?\" said Billy, not turning to face Jeremy. Before Jeremy could respond however, the door burst open, revealing a girl holding a backpack and a dance bag, leaning against the door, panting. \"Sorry I'm late. Do you know how hard- pant - it is to navigate these hallways? I need a map!\" Headmistress Everard walked in right behind this girl, smiling at Billy and putting a hand on her shoulder, while the new girl mimed gagging, making the whole class giggle. \"Everyone, this is Maria Chapell,\" said Everard, \"she's an exchange student for now, possibly a transfer-\" \"Yes, yes, that's enough, I can explain my life story to them!\" said Maria, making everyone's jaws drop. No one talked back to the headmistress, ever. \"Yes- well… alright then.\" and with that, the headmistress swept from the room. \"Alright, well now that that's taken care of…\" she set her stuff in the desk to the left of Billy, winking and making him blush, \"As you know, my name is Maria Jade Chapell, daughter of some dancers… call me Mars, I don't know why they called me Maria. I'm honored to be here, I've been badgering my parents since day one about studying dance in London, so… yeah.\" With that she sat down. By this point, all of the boys in the classroom were speechless. Mars was very pretty, with wavy brown hair going halfway down her back, brown eyes, and tan skin. Her eyes had a mischievous light in them. She obviously had a dancer's build, light and a small frame, and spoke with an American accent. After she sat down, and Mr. Graham recovered from his initial shock of being ignored, she turned to Billy and sent him a dazzling smile, much to the disappointment of the other boys, and the girls who were chasing after Billy (which accounted for three quarters of the class). \"Hi,\" she mouthed. \"Hi,\" he mouthed back. \"You're cute.\" He blushed. \"You're not so bad yourself.\" She threw back her head in silent laughter. They both turned back to pay attention to the class, both hardly being able to contain their excitement at the thought of being able to speak in normal tones. When class ended, before going to lunch, Billy leaned against the wall talking to a group of people. Billy was waiting for Mars, even though no one else realized it. As she exited the room a few minutes after the rest of the class, she looked around, and, seeing the group and Billy, walked over to them. \"So, lunch next? Right? I need all the help I can get here guys. Oh, and can you tell me your names? I need to be able to talk to you without feeling like a creep.\" Billy, clearly being the most comfortable, took the initiative. \"This is Victoria, Mary, Katie, and Marissa. These lads are Mark, Jeremy, Josh, Matt, and me, I'm Billy.\" At this point, Billy's calm and collected manner made Mars blush, something he was very pleased about. Billy knew he looked good, his shaggy blond hair and blue eyes, good muscular build, and kind smile made him more masculine than most of the other dancers, but then again, Billy was straight, which spoke for something. \"Well, great! Now I know-\" \"Now you know us, yes, great, whoopee, can we get food now?\" said Matt. Billy rolled his eyes, and fell back to walk behind with Mars, who was staring around her with wonder. \"RBS is a little overwhelming at first. I remember my first time.\" \"When was you first time? How long have you been here? Wh-\" Billy held a finger up to her lips to silence her. \"I'll tell you a little bit at lunch, but maybe…\" Billy took a deep, fortifying breath, \"Maybe we could talk more at dinner this weekend. I know a great place, if you want-\" \"Like a date?\" said Avery quietly. \"Yeah… Yeah, like a date!\" said Billy, happy that he had gotten his point across. \"Ok, I'd love that.\" \"So would I,\" whispered Billy to himself as Mars walked on, \"so would I.\" Ok, if you hate it just let me know… but all of the stories are Billy/ Michael, I just wanted to break out of the mold.

At that moment, he couldnthink of nothing better than a cup of tea and something hot to tidenhim over until he got home.

His mam was always accusing him of moping, while his fathernmaintained that it was for the best. \"It'sngood to have mates, but you and Billy were a bit too close. Notnhealthy that way, Michael. Boys... they shouldn't get like that.\" \"Why,nDad?\" Michael had asked. \"What d'you mean?\" \"Well...\"nHis father had begun to rub his neck, a sure sign he wasnuncomfortable. \"People will start thinking things. They'll assumenthings that aren't true, like, that could be damaging to how theynsee you.\" Poofs,nhe'd wanted to say. People will think me and Billy are poofs. Billynwasn't; Billy would never be. He was tough, despite being a dancer,nand he was smart enough to know that his masculinity would always benunder scrutiny. He would work hard to keep people from thinking that. But...nwhat about him? Michael knew he was different. He knew he likednthings that were different from what other boys liked. Other boysndidn't try on their sister's dresses while she was out. Othernboys didn't swap their Christmas presents for Barbie dolls. Andnthey definitely didn't kiss their best mates after holiday partiesnwhen everyone else had cleared off. \"OhnGod...\" he murmured under his breath. \"Please no...\" Itncouldn't be. He was different, but not really, was he? He went tonboxing and played football after school. He couldn't be a poof!nPoofs were nasty; they did dirty things. He'd only kissed Billy,nand it hadn't been dirty at all! It had been... nice. Warm, andnsweet, and safe. God,nhe missed him. It wasn't fair for Billy to leave him behind likenthat. He hadn't done anything wrong, and yet here he was, stucknwith sods like Jamie Steeple. It almost hurt not to see him everynday. Letters were nice; Michael kept all of the ones Billy had sentnin a box under his bed, covered in comic books and his boxing gloves.nBut they weren't the same. You couldn't hug a letter. He'dntried kissing one of them, but all he'd gotten was an ink stain onnhis lip and a fierce, aching need to throw himself across the bed andnsob. Michaelnput the 50p down beside his plate and stood up, pulling on his jacketnand hat. His mam really would be worried if he didn't get homenbefore eight. Thennight air was harsh, so bitingly cold that his face ached and hisnhands began to go numb as soon as he stepped outside. He rememberednBilly's cold hands, warming them for him, and then that slow, softnkiss... \"I'mna poof,\" whispered Michael to no one in particular. \"Christ, I'mna Goddamn poof.\" AndnBilly was...? Billy was strong and defiant and angry. Billy wasnafraid and sensitive and tender. Billy was a mystery. Billynhad kissed him. AsnMichael said goodbye to his best mate something wonderful hadnhappened. Billy had slowly, gently kissed him. \"Seenyou, Michael.\" AndnMichael had fought back tears as he replied huskily, \"Yeah. Seenyou, Billy.\" Whatndid it all mean? Billy, Michael, kisses, dancing, dresses, poofs,nJamie Steeple... Everything blurred together into a bright, painfulnpool of images. He had to pull himself away from them, think ofnsomething else, for he feared that if he looked too long he'd fallninside and drown. Michaelnsighed and jammed his hands deep into his pockets, walking slowlynthrough the darkening streets. He didn't understand Billy. Hendidn't understand why people thought what he felt for boys wasnwrong. He didn't even understand himself. Maybe he was a poof andnBilly was too. Maybe neither of them was. Thenonly thing Michael did know that when Billy kissed his nothing elsenin the world mattered, and there was only a rush of heat thatncanceled out everything else. Sharp tingles shot up and down his armsnand legs like they had gone to sleep and blood was beginning toncirculate again. Like electricity. Electricity.

It made me want to create some slash after squeeing over the two kissing scenes :') So, here it is!! Teeth chattering, Michael took a step backwards, waiting for his best friend, Billy, to answer. He hadn't seen him in years: five years to the day. Not that he was counting or anything. Finally, a tall figure answered the door, sandy blond hair hanging over his blue eyes, \"Michael!\" he breathed, before launching out of the warmth to hug his friend. \"Billy,\" Michael whispered, tightening his hold on him, relishing the feeling. He never got to tell Billy how he felt. It was only after he left to go to learn ballet did he realise his feelings for his Dancing Boy. \"Come in, man, it's fuckin' freezing out here,\" Billy exclaimed, pulling him in by their entwined hands. Michael could only laugh with relief: his Billy hadn't changed a bit. \"So how's the ballet doing?\" he asked as Billy led them to his living room/kitchen. He looked around, noting all of the certificates showing his achievements in dancing. \"Awesome,\" Billy grinned, pulling Michael down on the couch with him, \"I love it: everyone's in the same boat and all that, met some great people, like, although no one compared to you, 'course,\" he added, smiling at Michael. \"Aw, cheers mate,\" Michael blushed, wishing for Billy to mean it in another way. \"So how's things 'round your end?\" Billy asked. Michael noted he still kept hold of his hand, and none of them were objecting to it. \"Same old,\" Michael replied, still gazing at their hands, \"No one quite like you either.\" He looked up in time to see Billy's face split into a grin, \"We should've kept in touch or summit!\" he exclaimed. \"Aye, I know,\" Michael agreed, shyly stroking his thumb along the back of Billy's hand, loving the feeling of electricity running through his veins as he did so. \"D'ya want ought to drink?\" Billy asked, reluctantly pulling his hand away and standing up, \"Coke? Juice?\" \"Anything,\" he said, already missing the contact. As Billy arranged the drinks, Michael's eyes strayed to the floor, his mind on other things. He didn't realise until he was staring at it for a while that a magazine was stashed under the rug, the edge peeking out. Glancing at Billy, he quickly swiped it out and his eyes widened as he realised it had a picture of two very-naked guys in an intimate position. \"Here you are, mate.\" Shite. Billy had returned. \"Ah. I see you found me porn,\" Billy whispered, setting the drinks down on the table. Michael nodded, biting his lip, \"Since when were you a poof?\" Billy took a couple of breaths before answering, \"When I left. It just dawned on us, you know?\" Michael was sure his heart was going to burst out of his chest any minute now at the news. \"So, any good looking lads out there?\" he ventured, attempting to control his breathing. \"Aye…\" he replied, \"None that caught me eye, like, apart from one…\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. \"Who?\" Michael whispered, \"What's he look like?\" Billy finally looked at Michael again, unnerving him slightly at how intense the gaze was. \"Dark hair that's always soft… these amazing blue eyes that y'can get lost in… and the couple o' times we kissed, it were like electricity, going through me at a million miles an 'our.\" Michael opened his mouth a few times before murmuring, \"Do I know him?\" \"I would say you do,\" Billy replied, wetting his lips, his mouth parted, \"I think you know him pretty well, like.\" Blinking, Michael whimpered, confused. Surely he couldn't be implying that he liked him , of all people?! \"Me?\" he managed to croak out, breathing deeply. He watched as Billy's face crinkled with the force of his grin, his eyes alight, \"I knew you'd get it.\" And as if in slow motion, Michael watched as Billy leaned in, eyes fastened on his own still, before their lips finally met: soft, silky, smooth… perfect . \"Third time,\" Michael mumbled against his lips, eyes fluttering shut. Billy pulled back for breath and brought his chin forward for another, \"Fourth.\" \"If I could 'ave it my way, there'd be plenty more, Dancing Boy,\" Michael smirked, hands clutching his waist, wanting, needing , more of the electricity. \"Good,\" Billy grinned, resting his forehead against his, \"I'm planning on it, ya poof.\" \" Your poof,\" Michael corrected, stroking his sides. \"Aye,\" Billy smiled, melting his insides, turning them into jelly at the same time, \" My poof.\" THE END A/N2: :3 It's how it should've ended.

I own so little; so please don't steal. Background music: - Happy Christmas The house usually wasn't somewhere where he could have relaxed before. There were always people to look out for: his father, for coming home frustrated and moody after an unsuccessful strike; Tony, for coming home frustrated, moody, and violent after an unsuccessful strike; and Nana, who would wander off if he didn't keep an eye on her. But it seemed his absence did some good to the household; he'd heard shortly after he left for the School, the strike was over and his father and brother finally put their energy to productive use. His Nana, without his protective presence, took to wandering around the house and whispering her would-be dreams to inanimate objects. All in all, a healthy change from the previous Elliot abode. It wasn't that he hadn't wanted to come home for the holidays the past two years, but he'd just been too busy and too tired to do so. But this year, at the initiation of his teenage years (fourteen was a landmark!), he had finally found himself caught up in all his studies, had his pieces worked down right, and managed to read a map right and end up at the right bus stop. Tony came to pick him up. \"T'bad ya came back now; just gettin' fun without ya, ya bloody sod.\" Tony, Billy was glad to realize, was still the horrid older brother he was used to. Hopefully, though, this Christmas would pass without another piano being smashed to bits. His father greeted him and his Nana held him close gushing on about how she was so relieved he was back, but he was still following his dreams, wasn't he, and you know, she could have been a professional ballet dancer when she was younger. The house was still irreparably messy, the trademark of a house run by mostly men; Nana hadn't cleaned the house since he couldn't remember when. His room, his bed hadn't been rented out yet, and Billy collapsed onto it with a satisfied sigh. He was surprised things were going so well that he didn't want to think about it, lest he jinx himself. The mood was not sullen and downtrodden like the last Christmas he remembered at this house, and as he stared vaguely out the window, it started to snow. His father was just starting on an awkward journey into asking how ballet was going (\"So…I got yer letters…but…how's…the…the…ba…ugh…\") when Tony looked out the kitchen window while getting a beer and said, \"Billy, some lass's come to call for yeh.\" He hadn't gotten home for even four hours and his old friends were calling. He wasn't even aware they knew he was back. He honestly hoped it wasn't Debbie; they'd left on a rather awkward note and if she was going to make those advances (he had a feeling three years wasn't going to make pickup lines any better), he might have to pretend he'd also gotten deaf. As he poked his head out the kitchen window, he thought it was at first; certainly the olive pea coat and rather effeminate-looking wool scarf almost made him duck back down, but he recognized the frame, despite the growth of rather gangly limbs. Grabbing his coat and ignoring Tony's jeers that he was holding several girlfriends in different cities at once, he went out, careful not to slip on black ice. \"I heard you were back.\" Michael still had the little awkward smile Billy remembered, the one he thought was rather odd when he wasn't aware the boy was interested in that way in him. Billy shrugged, nodding further down the street as he was feeling Tony's eyes staring straight into his neck. \"Hello and Happy Christmas to you too, Michael.\" Michael laughed, softly and timidly and Billy hoped that was not rouge on the former's lips. The community center, only footsteps away, was closed and locked for the holidays and with a lack of anywhere else to go, the two sat on the steps. It had been a while since either of them had come there, Billy for boxing and Michael for Billy. \"Don't tell me you're going to whip another sherry outta those pockets.\" Michael laughed again. \"No, I left a little too quickly for that.\" There was a silence for interpretation. \"Have you been back long?\" \"You're lagging behind the welcome wagon.\" Billy watched as Michael blew out a steady stream of steam. They hadn't really been able to talk to each other the same since that Christmas, but when he thought about it, Michael was always a bit tense when they talked. He wondered if they had ever actually talked to each other and wondered aloud, \"So you've been gettin' more comfortable… expressing yourself , ain'cha?\" Michael looked down at himself with a bit of surprise. \"I don't think so. I didn't think it would be appropriate to see you in a skirt and anyways it's cold.\" There was a pause as he continued looking himself over. \"You really think so?\" \"More in public. Where's that jean jacket?\" \"Outgrown. In some alleyway, prob'ly.\" \"In any case, you've let your hair grow out longer.\" Billy reached over and touched the nape of Michael's neck, which previously had been bare. Now the dark hair extended toward the shoulders, not girly enough to be noticeable but not inconspicuous enough for Billy to leave alone. He had only run his fingers through it for a second when he suddenly pulled back. Michael flinched too and the two sat in silence again. \"So…um, how has school been?\" \"Lonely,\" Michael admitted, pulling up and hugging his knees to his chest. \"It was…hard not to see you sitting in front of me and then the next year started…but…there's this kid.\" He smiled the little smile. \"He's nice and we've talked…he's different from everyone else…darker…\" Michael waved his hand to try and convey the sense of race without actually saying it. Billy nodded. \"He a poof too?\" Michael gave him a pointed look. \"How has the school for poofs been for you , eh?\" \"Same as always.\" Billy sat back, the cold of the stone steps biting into his hands; he didn't bother to bring gloves. \"There are kids who think I'm a sod for not comin' from London, but it's nothing.\" \"Did you…meet anyone? Anyone you like?\" \"That makes it sound like you haven't given up on me.\" Billy laughed, punching Michael's shoulder lightly. \"I didn't mean it like that. I just wanted to know if you had friends.\" Michael's face colored slightly; he bit his lip in a way that convinced Billy the shade of red was actually natural. \"But…did you?\" \"Make friends?\" \"Yeah…and…\" \"Lemme put it this way…you're the only poof I talk to.\" It was supposed to be lighthearted but the way Michael laughed nervously made Billy feel like he had said the wrong thing. If he mentioned it again, it would be blatantly obvious he had said the wrong thing. Letting a long pause settle between this and the next thing either of them said would do the same thing. It was bad enough Michael seemed to still harbor some sort of feeling for his sorry arse. Well, anyway, it was Christmas, and they shouldn't be staying out too late anyway. \"…Good night, I guess,\" Billy mumbled, feeling the need to escape back into the Elliot household overriding the feeling to explain himself. Michael nodded quickly, and Billy had decided to be spontaneous again and it didn't hurt to kiss your best mate (kids did it all the time in London, sometimes), but apparently, Michael was thinking the same thing because the two turned to each other and in the process of finding the other's cheek, ended up with a mouthful of the other's lips. There was no amount of awkward laughter or silence that could patch this one up. \"So, ah, I bet blokes in London…you see things like that?\" Michael asked, his cheeks flaring up to match the brightness of his scarf. Billy never noticed how the boy's gray eyes accented his features; he figured that whatever just happened somehow heightened his senses. Both of them had gotten up and were making their way back up the street. Billy jerked his head noncommittally. It was too weird to explain; it was okay when they were eleven, but it was different at fourteen. Michael interpreted this contemplative silence as rejection. \"If…if I don't see you again…I hope you do alright at the School.\" They had stopped in front of the Elliot house, where Billy was thankful not find Tony watching them from the kitchen window. It had started snowing again. The quirky little smile was back and Michael was about to walk away when Billy spoke up. \"Your folks going to be home tomorrow?\" Michael blinked. \"I…brought home one of those gauzy skirts the girls wear. I thought you'd like it.\" The boy stared at him for a moment. \"Now who's the poof?\" Michael said, a teasing smile replacing the surprise. \"Stuffing a dress in your bag.\" \"It was for you, I promise.\" \"Dirty tosser, thinking about me in a dress.\" Kicking snow at him, Michael turned (twirled, almost) on his heel and started for home. He'd walked along, feeling his shoes crunch in the snow underfoot and heard the creak of the Elliot gate as Billy made for the door. He waited until he was far enough (or at least when Billy had gotten to the door), before turning around and shouting, \"Happy Christmas, stupid ballet wanker!\" Owari Note: Must stop writing fanfictions for things I just watch.

It's probably going to be a oneshot, unless I get a lot of feedback or something. Whoever spots the musical reference in the last paragraph gets a cookie! Oh, and enjoy! Disclaimer : I don't own Billy Elliot (the story), or any of the characters I used in here. Background info : (Like I said, only saw the musical, so forgive me if it's different from what happens in the movie!) The long coal miners strike has just ended, and the small town in England which our characters live in know that it's going to fall apart. Billy, the protagonist who had been friends with both Michael (the gay friend who he played \"dress up\" with) and Debbie (who he danced ballet with in her mother's class), was accepted to the Royal Ballet school and left for London. The floor of the dance studio was cold, and Debbie's heavy breathing echoed off of the walls. Once again, she tried a round of pirouettes. She failed, as she'd been doing for the past hour or so, but this time it was worse; she tripped over her own tired, weary feet. \"Ugh!\" She landed on the floor with a thud and grunted with frustration. \"Damned floor…\" turning over, she examined her knee, which was at the moment bright red. It would probably swell up later, and mam wouldn't be happy. \"Just great.\" Debbie had been practicing truly hard lately, but not from inspiration after Billy's amazing feat. Really she was just doing what everyone in town had been doing after the end of the coal strike: going through the motions; knowing they were hopeless, helpless, and pointless, but going through them anyway. She'd never be a great ballet dancer. If she was lucky, maybe she'd end up being a teacher, like her mam. Not that she'd inherit her business, though. No one was sure how long her mother would be able to keep having classes. Definitely not long enough for her to take them over. For some reason Debbie couldn't quite identify, tears gathered in her eyes. She told herself it was simply because of the steady throbbing behind her right knee which seemed to be mocking her as the tears began to spill over. And they wouldn't stop. Debbie walked up to the darkened window - the closest thing to a mirror in the room. Weakly, she curled the corners of her lips up into a smile. The grin looked hard and cold, plastic-like, like the Barbie nurse that Michael had gotten at Christmas time. It frightened her, the girl in the glass who seemed as though she was so fragile she'd fall apart with a single touch. Although it wasn't too surprising. Debbie thought about how she'd been not so long ago, all smiles and acting like the little kid she was. The one who she supposed people thought was still there. Sure, she still went around, trying to seem perky and to look on the bright side. But there wasn't much of that to look at lately. Whenever she was alone, the façade crumbled. Seeing her lifeless reflection the tears only came faster, and as a sob escaped her mouth, a pitiful sense of relief washed over Debbie. Her reflection now, looking afraid and frustrated, seemed much more real. Stepping abruptly away from the mirror, inspired, she tried her pirouettes again. Anger made her turns sharp, practically giving her whiplash, but somehow the movements seemed more fluid and genuine than they had before. Until, of course, her neck snapped, shooting pain making her stumble. It was as if something else, besides her neck, snapped inside of her. Another chunk of her composure slipped away and she fell to her knees, burying her hands and howling. Flopping forward, she beat on the floor. \"Why him?!\" She shouted to the biting air. \"Why not me ?!\" Suddenly the one thing that Debbie tried deliberately not to think about came rushing into her mind, and she found she couldn't push it out: Billy Elliot. Before, when he was around and muddling through dance lessons and making a fool of himself, she had grown to like him. But now how she thought of him was much more complex. The first layer, the one she showed to the world, was just happiness. She was happy she'd gotten to befriend him, gotten the chance to learn beside him. Happy she could point at him, the boy who was accepted to the Royal Ballet School, and say \"I know him.\" Lying just slightly under that was bitterness. And then, just under that, was a murky place that Debbie didn't like to think about. It was furious, hopeful yet cynical, and extremely desperate. She had been taking classes longer than him. Her mother was the teacher , for God's sake. And she'd thought she was really good. But then Billy had showed up, and sure, he'd had his trials and tribulations, but overall it all came so easily to him. And he made Debbie realize that, sure, she was good. But he was great. She was decently talented, and he was awe-inspiring. She was the dreamer, and he was the dream. And in a way, she'd fallen for him. Granted, it was \"falling\" for someone as much as someone her age could, and that was a fact that had been readily pointed out by any adult within earshot when she had talked about him, and the love had crept into her voice. But her mind justified that by saying that it only made it worse. Sure, adult love had more emotions, more caring, more understanding, while little kid love was mostly want, sometimes with a little admiration. To her, that made it seem more pure. But, looking back, she realized she'd never really liked him. Sure, she'd liked him as a friend. A very, very dear one. In a sick sort of way she still did. But what she'd liked- liked was his talent. It was like when some other child had something better than her, and she would want it, but in a far off sort of way, knowing she couldn't have it. With Billy, it hadn't seemed like that. After all, he lived in the same town she did. His father was another man on strike, his mother was dead. He was as normal as anyone else. She didn't realize until later that, despite all this, he was unattainable. Untouchable. The echo-ey room distorted the sounds of her cries, and Debbie didn't realize just how loud she'd been until she heard the door creek and she clamped a hand over her mouth. The contrasting silence pushed up against her ears. \"Debbie?\" The rush of relief at hearing Michael's voice was immediate. It took a second for the horror to hit her, too. Frantically rubbing her eyes and streaky face and she picked herself up on the floor, she called \"Come in!\" And come in he did, his head popping in to the sight of Debbie in an impromptu stretch. It may have worked, actually, if her face weren't so puffy. And if he hadn't heard her. A look of concern crossed over Michael's face. \"What are you doing here?\" He meant the question seriously, but the tight grin that Debbie had plastered on for impersonation's sake grew a bit more genuine and she took in the boy's outfit: flowy purple skirt and a cardigan which just peeked out from under his coat. A small laugh burbled to her lips, and the look on his face only made it turn into a steady stream of hysterics. \"I could ask you that, too,\" Debbie gasped out between bouts of laughter. \"You're mental, you know,\" Michael said matter-of-factly, giggling a bit himself. \"Says the boy in the skirt - you look like a puff.\" Putting his hands on his hips indignantly, Michael insisted \"I like this outfit.\" \"Yeah.\" Debbie fluffed out her tutu. \"That's the problem. \" The look on Michael's face softened at the words. \"Actually, that's what I wanted to ask you,\" he said, pulling her by the wrist over to some chairs by the wall. Debbie tensed up and didn't say anything as he directed her across the room, or as they sat. \"What's the matter?\" Michael asked point-blank, staring straight into her face. \"What do you mean?\" Debbie retorted. It may have been more convincing if she hadn't found her friend's dark, caring eyes so unnerving at the moment. Well, not \"friend\" exactly. Michael had been Billy's best friend - for all she knew, he still was. But since Billy had left, the two had made some sort of need-based acquaintance-ship of their own. Michael's gaze didn't waver. \"I couldn't sleep, so I snuck out and went on a walk. And I heard you outside before.\" This made Debbie look up, surprised. As she did so she noted a slightly cracked window. Fuck , she thought to herself. She'd never been much of a swear-er before, but she'd picked it up recently. Her mother, Mrs. Wilkinson, didn't exactly approve, but there wasn't much she could do. When unfortunate circumstance had already stolen most of one's innocence, accepting swear words didn't really spoil much. \"You were…yelling, sort of,\" the boy continued. \"And you're face is…\" faltering, Michael simply reached up with one hand to brush her cheek wordlessly. Debbie's shoulders stiffened at his touch. \"I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm fine. I…\" She hadn't even realized how close she was to crying again until she felt the cool air blast the fresh wetness on her cheek. Michael pulled his hand away, a tear caught on his finger glittering in the dim light. The boy nodded slightly, putting his hand over Debbie's tiny shoulder. \"Do…do you th-think we're all going to be okay?\" Her voice came out weak and frail, wavering as uncertainty choked up her throat. It was amazing. She looked forward, and a week seemed like a near eternity, and yet it felt as if the future kept hurtling towards her, a big question mark on the horizon growing larger every moment. Maybe this was what her mother meant when she reflected onto her own youth and lamented about how time passed so quickly. If this is what it's like to grow up , Debbie thought tersely, then I don't like it. \"Of course we are!\" Michael said brightly. \"We can get out of here someday. Why, just look at Billy!\" At this a small sob escaped from Debbie's throat. The boy's bright-eyed face fell. \"Hey, it's alright…\" Michael uncomfortably tried to wipe her tears away, but they kept coming and he resorted to patting her back. Debbie wondered if the words brought a bitter taste to his mouth, like they did to hers. They tasted like a lie. Apparently he'd noticed her change as he'd mentioned his friend. \"Are you upset about Billy or something?\" Debbie's face scrunched up real small. \"Do you…do you miss him?\" \"Of course I do,\" Michael said with a nod. \"I wish we could keep in touch more, but…it's a bit hard at times. I…I really liked him a lot. I still do.\" A weird look crossed over the boys face, and he shook his head to clear it. Thinking of all the girls who had suddenly dropped ballet classes, Debbie nodded understandingly. \"I don't know if I do,\" she murmured. \"I mean, I do, but I'm so…so mad at him!\" Although her face was still wet and shiny, no more tears seemed to be coming. Debbie figured she was probably cried out. \"Why does he get to be so lucky?\" \"Well sometimes you've got to make your own damn luck! You just can't worry all of the time.\" Michael bit his lip in thought, then smiled resolutely. \"Why don't you come over to my place tomorrow? We can dress up.\" Debbie frowned. \"What for?\" \"We need a reason?\" The way Michael said this, as if genuinely surprised, made Debbie smile, the hardened trails on her cheeks making the movement feel crusty. \"Tomorrow it is,\" she said, the two shaking hands as if they just finished a business deal. \"Debbie?\" A voice chimed from outside. \"Oh, shit!\" Debbie and Michael stood up quickly as Mrs. Wilkinson entered the room. \"Hello, Miss,\" Michael said in a friendly tone to Debbie's mum. She, however was having none of it, waving her hand as if to swat the words away like a mosquito. \"What have you been doing, Debbie?! I saw you weren't home and have been looking for you! Do you really think I have all this free time I've been dying to waste?\" She put her hands on her hips, looking angry and annoyed. \"I know,\" Debbie said in a small voice. \"I'm…I'm really sorry.\" She raced up and threw her arms tightly around her mother's waist, burying her face into the fabric. If only she could stay there forever, with her mother's smell in her nose and the solid feel of her, the coolness of the jacket against her hot skin, and never have to grow up or face the future or think about much of anything besides how lovely it was to hold her. Slowly, as if surprised, Mrs. Wilkinson put her arms on her daughters back, patting it and adding to the feeling of safety. If only all of our problems could be solved with a hug , Debbie thought, both wistful and sad. Letting go, Mrs. Wilkinson held her daughter at arms length and asked harshly \"Now just what the hell were you thinking?\" \"Well,\" Michael piped in, \"I'll see you tomorrow, Debbie….\" He trailed off uncomfortably as he walked towards the door. \"Michael?\" He walked a few steps backwards slowly so he was facing Debbie's mother. \"Yes, Miss?\" \"What are you wearing?\" Mrs. Wilkinson asked, a bit of shock in her voice. The boy grinned, and Debbie turned her head enough to catch some of it and to smile back. \"One of my favorite outfits,\" he responded simply before walking out the door. \"Mam?\" Debbie murmured softly, as if any noise too loud would break the moment like a snowflake. \"Do you think I could ever be a dancer?\" The question had everything - all of Debbie's wonders and worries, hopes and reservations, dreams and acceptances of reality - woven into one innocent-seeming inquiry. Little did Debbie's mum know it, but she held her daughter's heart, along with one of her last scraps of innocence, in her wizened hands. She looked her daughter over, from the knee which was starting to turn purple and blue to the crusty and puffy cheeks, to the feverish looking eyes, and simply said \"Not you're face looking like that.\" Debbie was about to protest, when she shut her mouth. It wasn't a yes, but it wasn't a no. It wasn't much of an answer, really. Walking out into the night, she gazed at the moon and the stars which probably looked down and knew everyone's fate, and marveled that maybe those were the only kinds of honest answers anyone really had.

Du wirst den Schmerz, den ich fühle, nie kennen, den Schmerz, den ich jede Sekunde fuehle, wenn ich an dich erinnert werde. Weisst du noch, als du zu meinem Haus gekommen bist, und ich in der Kleidung meiner Schwester war? Du erzähltest mir über die Ballett-Schule. Ich habe gesagt, dass du nicht gehen solltest. Ich habe gesagt, dass du nicht gehen solltest, weil ich dich vermissen würde. Ich denke jeden Tag meines Lebens daran. Bitte geh nicht, Billy bat ich. Ich habe dich darum gebeten, denn ich würde dich vermissen. Ich haette stattdessen sagen sollen, dass ich liebe dich. Erinnerst du dich an letztes Weihnachten?

The cold of the bitter winter, the merciless ice always at his throat and grinding into his chest as it gives him nothing but the most useless of hope for any survival. His physical body survives while my mental state deteriorates with each growing day. He stares through a lifeless eye that seems to show him nothing more than the poison of his wound. The infection that brings him to his knees as he know he may have no more ounce of fight left in him. He's just a shell that waits for time to decide it's final moment; degrading slowly and breaking because of time. Why me?! His tears ran freely down his face as the wind wrapped around him while he ran in a full out sprint across the rocky ground. The cold winter air bit viciously into his bones as he sobbed running past people who looked at him as though he was some mad, loads of people thought now that they knew about him, he was mad or had something wrong with him. His long scarf whipped back into his face and his hat felt like it was about to fall off but he didn't care. His life had been so perfect. He had been hidden from everybody and yet he had been able to find someone he could love; Billy bloody Elliot. His dancing boy. Everyday they would sneak away behind the bicycle shed at school and he would watch his secret crush dance with such amazing skill that he would always be left in complete awe at how brilliant he was. He could always admire Billy's amazing skills in dancing, he could sit there for hours and just watch him. One day he could say that when that boy first began his career as the worlds best dancer. Yet now it was all over. Everyone at school had found out about him... normally he could deal with it, mainly because before it had been him and Billy. No one would ever dare mess with him with Billy around because the two were a perfect team... But now his best friend was gone and it was just him again. How long was it before my parents knew? Already they at school the others had started attacking him. People he had though who had been his own friends had turned against him. School had been the one place where he could escape to from a life of pain. He couldn't take this no more. No more. It was only when he reached the other side of the park where he knew no one else ever went did he finally come to a stop. The rose bushes were fading under a weighed blanket of snow next to the broken ice covered river, while a coven of strong standing oaks stood around the area as though they were soldiers protecting their king. He had come here for long runs with Billy. They could just cut through the tunnel which wasn't for far away... It had been so funny. The other idiots in the class had ran through up on the hill taking a ridiculous amount of time to carry on... but it just wasn't right without having Billy around to cut through. But it had been hen he was tracing his memories with Billy, he had found this area. He liked coming here, he often did when his mother was working late and his father was to busy smoking cigars, drinking to the bottom of the bottles and talking to his imaginary protégé; the boy he wished truly was his son. The figure would feel lonely at home it was no wonder he had brought himself to this. He would sit on the old rope swing and gently push out as it rocked him back and forth over the water \"Why can't anything in my life just go right for once! I'm sick of these stupid dreams! I'm sick of always being alone!\" He whispered and wiped away the slowly oncoming tears which froze quickly to his cheek. The water was freezing; he would be dead in a matter of seconds. His body would sink to the bottom and they wouldn't find him till summer… that's how long it would take his parents to even realise that he was missing, but as he was the smallest step away from stepping into the sweet oblivion of the after life; a place where even his parents couldn't hurt me. No more having to listen to a pissed up father exclaim what a waste and freak that his son was. But that's when he heard the last voice that he least expected to hear. \"Now what the hell do you think you're doing\" \"F-Fuck off.\" Michael didn't turn around. It had to be a dream... It just had to be. There was no way the owner of that voice was really back here. No. This was just one of those dreams. \"You're just another trick, like in them blooming dreams.\" \"Turn around Michael you Puff.\" He could hear the sly grin in the voice though there was something wary about it now. The boy paused as he shook a fallen white snow flake which had landed on a loose lock of hair, he tucked it back under his hat and let his hands hang to the cold and biting air. His eyes almost seemed lifeless as he looked at the pale water in front of him. The smallest step of being out of pain. From being free. \"Fucking 'ell just turn around and come back!\" The voice barked at him. Michael blinked at the water just a bit longer before he slowly began to turn around. And there stood the boy that made his chest tighten all the more. \"Dancing boy.\" He whispered. \"I know me own name, now get back from that bleeding edge will ya!\" Michael exclaimed. His eyebrows were bunched together with slight worry and his face was set hard. He was wearing his familiar big winter coat. His hands were pale from the cold just as Michael's were. \"Bloody hell what were you thinking?\" He exclaimed as slowly he pulled Michael back. \"What would you know dancing boy! You haven't been here!\" He regretted saying that the moment it left his lips. What surprised him even more was the slight look of guilt which burned through Billy's eyes as he could no longer meet his gaze directly. \"Well it's good that I've come back with a plan isn't it!\" He gave a sly smile as both boys locked eyes and held each others gaze. \"Don't do that.\" Michael muttered as he began to walk away but decided to take a firm seat on a nearby swing instead. \"Do what?!\" \"Look at me like that.\" \"What the 'ell do you mean!\" \"Like you did the day you left.\" Michael turned his head away slightly. There was just too much going through his mind. \"Look at me and then kiss me!\" \"You're kidding right?\" \"This isn't funny!\" Michael frowned slightly as he put his hands into his pocket. Billy could see just how bad the boy was trembling now. What the hell had happened to him when he had been away? Who ever had hurt his best friend like this... that was going to change, very soon. \"You're blooming freezing.\" Billy muttered as he pulled the boy close and put an arm around his shoulders. He only just realised that he had grown a bit and now he was the smallest of a bit taller than his best friend. \"Tall git.\" Michael murmured quietly as though he had been reading his best friend's mind. \"Shut up you puff.\" Billy smirked as he began the long walk back. \"Your Ma'am home?\" \"And half pissed up with me dad.\" \"Good, then that means that they won't notice.\" \"Notice what?\" Billy's smirked just deepened. He rubbed Michael's back trying to give the boy some of his warmth back. \"I want to drop by somewhere first.\" He ignored the confused look his best friend gave him. \"Don't worry. Have some faith in me.\" \"There's no one who has ever had more faith in you dancing boy.\" He pretended not to hear Michael say that. -Break- Billy smiled as he watched Michael rub his hands together in the centre of the boxing ring. \"Never bloody changes, it's always bleeding freezing in here!\" He whispered as he breathed his warmth breath into his hands. \"ye're right. Some things don't change.\" Billy chuckled as he held out the old tutu that he had once made his friend wear. \"Go on. It suits you.\" He grinned but didn't notice as a large blush moved across both of Michael's cheeks. \"Shut up.\" He muttered before stepping into it, still curious as to why his friend had brought them back here. \"You remember what to do?\" He shed his coat and kicked away his shoes and jeans as he went to gently take Michael's hands and place them into their correct position. He watched Michael's eyes darting and glancing towards him as their fingers would brush together slightly. Then again... he hardly felt his own slight blush moving at that point. He smiled slightly as he watched Michael beginning to slowly replicate the moves confidently. \"You're good.\" He observed. \"Been practising, ain't I.\" Michael said quietly though a faint smile tugged at his lips as he performed through the basic movements. \"I'd say.\" Billy nodded as he watched. \"So what's this plan you got... what won't my parent's notice?\" Michael frowned. \"Well if you think they're gonna worry-\" \"Will they fuck!\" Michael exclaimed with a frown. \"Good because after here we're heading back to yours. Like I said.\" Billy gave a small smile. \"I have a plan, don't I?\" ","Summary":" He still waits for it to end.

Melvin Burgess escribió una novela basada en la película… ¿yo? solo soy culpable de escribir sin fines de lucro, así que nada de demandas ¡gracias! Notas: Tenía muchas ganas de escribir algo de Billy y Michael, aunque lo que tenía en mente era algo completamente diferente. Al final mi musa imaginaria (dudo tener alguna) decidió que quería algo más melancólico y triste, y yo me dije \" ¡qué rayos!, lo haré, ¡total!, es mejor que trabajar \" así que espero quedará algo no muy disperso. Trata sobre la despedida de estos dos, sería desde el Punto de Vista de Michael… No recuerdo mucho de la peli, así que tal vez me tomé alguna que otra \"libertad literaria\". Si alguien lo lee agradeceré enormemente comentarios y sugerencias, recibirlos me hacen el día como no tienen idea :D No te deseo amor. Te llamé y viniste, como siempre que lo hago. Hablamos, no recuerdo muy bien el que, estaba ocupado tratando de grabar en mi memoria tu imagen de mejillas sonrojadas, tu respiración agitada por el esfuerzo que fue llegar corriendo a mi casa. Luego sucedió algo que no esperaba. Tus manos en mis hombros, tus labios en mi mejilla. Mi corazón flotó, salió de mi pecho y se evaporó. Más la burbuja de felicidad se rompió al verte alejar colina abajo. ¿Acaso esta era la despedida? Una dulce y dolorosa despedida. En mi interior sé que esto jamás podrá ser, lo vi en tu mirada aquella vez que tímidamente posé mis labios en tu fría piel. No fue un \" no \" gritado con desprecio, como tanto temí, pero fuiste lo bastante claro para saber que, aunque me aceptabas tal como era, \" esto \" (una relación sentimental) no pasaría jamás. Ahora sé que te vas y tal vez no regreses, no me lo dijiste tampoco, pero de nuevo lo vi. Siempre me hablas tanto con tus miradas… Te deseo suerte, como siempre. Te deseo dicha y prosperidad. Te deseo que todo lo que te propongas lo puedas lograr. Pero no te deseo amor. Al menos no como el mío. Porque duele, y no sabes cuanto. ¡Todo duele! El levantarte en la mañana, el mirar, el intentar sobrevivir recogiendo lo que queda de un endeble sueño, luchando contra los débiles intentos que la cruel esperanza lanza en forma de \" quizás \" o \" tal vez \" …callar Lo mucho que me hiere el que estés cerca pero al mismo tiempo seas inalcanzable. Porque por más considerado que intentes ser conmigo no hay manera de tocar un corazón roto sin que caigan más piezas, porque cada roce lo desmorona un poco más. Pero no puedo decírtelo, porque estas a mi lado y eres tan dulce, estas aquí, no de la manera que quiero pero aun estas. Temo que si lo digo esta vez si me dejes. ¿Y qué haría yo entonces? Añadiéndole a mi sufrimiento la culpa de saber que el único responsable de que te fueras fui yo, al agobiarte con mis tontos problemas. Tontos, porque yo mismo los provoqué. Y entonces uno piensa \" ¿Para qué ?\", ¿Para qué existo?, ¿Para qué sigo?, ¿Para qué me esfuerzo en reparar algo que tarde o temprano también volverá a romperse otra vez? ¿Para qué me empeño en volver a sentir? ¿Para qué sigo intentando mantener en pie este pequeño espacio en el que no deseo tener a nadie más que a ti? Luego una mirada, luego una sonrisa. Y el cielo parece abrirse otra vez, un tímido rayo de sol aparece tras la colina. Crees que podrías vivir con solo ese pequeño calor… pero entonces las tinieblas vuelven, porque la realidad siempre vuelve. Es una montaña rusa, de sentimientos contradictorios enfrentándose con la misma fuerza. Te lo digo, esto de enamorarse de un amigo es lo peor. Por eso no te lo deseo Billy, no a ti. Abajo veo que te espera tu padre, tal vez esto es lo mejor, que te vayas ahora lejos de este caos que te daña tanto. Mereces ser feliz, dejar de ser taciturno y darle esperanza a los demás con tu baile. Y sé que de alguna manera, sin escucharte, manteniéndote a la distancia, con el tiempo necesario, yo también estaré mejor. Ondeas tu brazo hacia mí, es la señal oficial del adiós. Te devuelvo el gesto, agradecido de que estés lo suficientemente lejos para ser incapaz de ver la lágrima que corre por mi mejilla. He escuchado que dicen que un adiós no es un para siempre. En mi caso sí lo es. Porque al decirte el adiós se que para siempre te querré. Como se quiere a las cosas que uno no puede tener: inocentemente, eternamente.

Well at least he was asleep untill the sound of stones hitting his window awoke him from his slumber. Michael groggily walked over to the window, pulled it open and looked down. Even from two storeys up he could recognise that face. \"Well are you gunna come down or not man?\" Billy Elliot shouted from the ground. Grinning widely, Michael climbed akwardly down the tree next to the window and landed ungracefully on the looked up at Billy. \"Thanks for that, you know i was really lookin' forward to climbing down a tree at this un-fuckin'- godly hour.\" \"Not pleased to see me then eh?\" Asked Billy Michael stood up and threw his arms around his best friends neck. \"Oh, you know i am dancing boy, but what I wanna know is why the fuck you are outside my house at 20 to midnight and why I didn't know you were coming home.\" \"It was s'posed to be a surprise, and as for the time, the late buses are cheaper and I was desparate to see my poof of a best friend.\" \"Look who you are calling poof, ballet boy!\" \"Well you are, ain't ya!\" Michael jumped forward to push Billy to the ground and they both ended up sprawled on the damp grass. Michael rolled sideways and lay next to Billy. \"I missed this, just messing around, I love all the dancin' don't get me wrong but I miss this place, I miss everyone, especially you, ya great big poof.\" \"I missed you to, I've been stuck here with Debbie bloody Wilkinson following me round like a fuckin' lost puppy, asking me when you're comin' back every 5 seconds.\" \"She once asked me if I wanted to see her fanny, you know.\" \"What did you say?\" \"No of course, I don't like her like that.\" \"But she likes you like that, and its getting bloody well irritating, she keeps following me home, I havent been able to dress up for weeks, like.\" \"You know, man, I tried to sneak you out a tutu but one of the older ones caught me and asked if it was for me and if it was could he see me in it! But don't worry, I told him that only my best mate's allowed to see me in a skirt.\" \"To right I am.\" \"so anyway, you gunna invite us inside then, it's freezin' out here, and I can't dance with no toes.\" \"Are you takin' the piss or what Billy?\" \"What, man?\" \"Remember what happened last time you said that. And it ain't even cold.\" \"You know I didn't mean that and i didn't mind anyway. And it is cold once you've been down south, it's so warm in london.\" \"Lucky for some, ain't your dad gunna be wonderin' where you are?\" \"Naah, I told him I was staying at yours tonight.\" \"And he didn't mind.\" \"No way man, it was his bloody idea, said you'd been crying like a fuckin' bairn since I'd left.\" \"No I haven't!.. well maybe a little bit, it made my mascara run.\" \"You haven't changed then, you bloody poof, so are you gunna invite us in?\" \"Yeah sure, go on up the tree then, should be easy enough for you, with all your poncin' about.\" \"Fuck off Michael.\" Billy said, climbing quickly up the tree and through the window before laughing at Michael struggling to get up. Finally, they were both in Michaels room and sitting on his bed. \"ahh, that's much better now thanks.\" \"So, hows the ballet going?\" \"Alright, its hard but I like it, Oh Michael, you should see some of the stuff they make me wear, it would make even you cringe, i've gotta wear leggings! Fuckin' leggings! And some of the other guys stuff paper down 'em so I took so outta place. You know I think I'd rather wear the flippin' tutu, man!\" \"No I think I'd rather you wore the leggings, man, like you said, im the only one who can see you in a skirt.\" \"true enough but still they're like skin tight and i can see all the others looking at me because im the youngest.\" \"Bloody perverts.\" \"So michael, hows things round here then?\" \"Same as usual, everyone misses you though.\" \"Yeah right, everyone hated me 'cause im the poof who dances.\" \"Okay, mebbie not everyone, but i do, and yer dad and nan and Tony, when he gets drunk he always goes round shoutin' how he misses his little brother and how he wishes you were still here.\" \"So maybe he does actually like me. So hows school without us?\" \"Bloody boring, I can tell you that, and everyone picks on me even worse now, 'cause you ain't there to protect me and me dad can't do nowt 'cause he's always pissed as assholes.\" \"Stand up to them mike, like you say, it's all about expressing yourself!\" \"I have a feelin' that they wouldn't like the way I express myself.\" \"They might decide it's brilliant, and that they all want to dress up in womens clothin'\" \"Or they might pick on me even worse.\" \"Probably Both boys went silent.'That was the good thing about Billy' michael thought, They could just sit in silence with no minutes passed before Billy said: \"We should probably go to sleep now.\" \"Yeah, right, You can have the bed, i'll sleep on the floor.\" \"No you bloody well won't.\" \"Well, I cant have you sleeping on the floor, dancing boy.\" \"I weren't gunna, yer beds big enough, we can share.\" \"What, did somone kick you in that big head of yours? You wanna share a bed with me even though I'm a poof?\" \"yeah, whats it matter? I had to dance with boys who've stuffed their trousers with paper, so whats it matter if i sleep in the same bed as you, yer me best mate.\" \"Thanks, Billy.\" They both climbed into Michaels bed and lay facing eachother. \"I missed ya, you know that, right?\" Said Billy \"'Course I do, I missed ya too.\" \"Alright then, go to sleep the ya poof.!\" Michael slapped the back of Billy's head playfully. Billy responded by kissing Michael on the cheek. \"Goodnight Billy.\" Michael choked out. \"Goodnight Michael.\" Both of them settled down to sleep.[Chapter 2] Light trickled in through the open window and Billy's eyes flickered open. For a second he looked around before he remembered where he was, Michaels bedroom. He looked at the clock beside the bed. \"Oh shit!\" He exclaimed, shaking Michael awake.\" \"Fuck of.\"Michael murmered before rolling over to go back to sleep. \"No, michael, wake up, it's 11 o'clock! Me dads gonna kill me!\" Michael woke with a start and jumped over Billy, out of the bed, landing on the floor like a half dead starfish. \"Real canny Michael.\" Said Billy climbing more gracefully out of the bed. Michael clambered to his feet. \"Alright, mate, listen, I've gotta get home, me dad'll be waitin' for us.\" \"Alright then, you better get off, see ya Billy.\" \"Yeah, see ya Michael.\" Billy climbed swiftly back down the tree before running in the direction of his house. Finally, he reached it, breathless and sweating. \"Hey dad, Tony, hey nan.\" Billy greeted each of them in turn.. Tony smirked, \"Have fun at Michaels last night?\" \"Yeah\" \"So what were you doin'?\" \"Talking, mucking around.\" \"That all?\" \"Yeah, why?\" \"Nothing.\" Billy stared at his brother confusedly before shrugging his shoulders and turning to his dad who was busy cooking eggs on the stove. \"So, dad, can i go and see Mrs wilkinson after breakfast? It's saturday so she should be down at the social.\" \"yeah, she'll be glad to see you. You can say hello to George an' all .\" \"Alright then.\" said Billy as his dad put a plate of eggs and bread infront of him. Billy wolfed it down and then rushed out of the door with a, \"See ya later!\" and headed towards the social. Billy could hear the music before he got inside the doors, he'd missed this place, where he first came to love ballet. He passed George on the way in, who simply smiled and clapped him on the shoulder. Billy stepped through the wire mesh doors an into a room full of girls in leotards and tutus. Debbie was the first to spot him and she gasped, attracting the attention of the other girls and Mrs Wilkinson, who walked up to him and then stopped suddenly. \"Billy Elliot, what in heavens name are you doing here?\" \"I've come home for Christmas and I wanted to see you, miss.\" \"Why the bloody hell would you want to do that?\" \"I did miss you, miss.\" \"I can't see why, Havent you got loads of new teachers that you can follow around like a lost puppy.\" \"All my new teachers are good but you're still my favourite, miss.\" \"Oh now you're just making things up, c'mere.\" She held her arms open and billy stepped into the wrapping his arms around her waist tightly, he stayed there for a long while before mrs. wilkinson stepped away from him. She turned to see all the girls staring at them. \"What the fuck are you looking at? get back over to the barre, feet in first, arms in fifth and stop staring at Billy like he's turned into a goldfish! And 1,2,3 and 1,2,3 and plie and hold.\" Debbie left the barre and came over to where Billy stood near the doors of the hall. \"Hey.\" She said \"Hey, how'r you?\" \"Alright, but it isn''t the same without you here and I'm the only person who'll talk to Michael and he's really annoying. All moody and that.\" \"Yeah he gets like that but I like it.\" \"Speak for yourself anyways how school?\" \"It's good but they dont half work me hard, 5 hours of dance every morning then 4 hours of school in the afternoon and there's some little twat who follows me around all the time.\" \"He probably fancies you. You'd better not tell Michael, he'd get jealous.\" \"Hope not he's like six makes me feel like a dirty old man. And why would he do that?\" \"Debbie Wilkinson, get you arse over here right now or i swear to high heaven i will drop you of the top of this building.\" \"Oh shit, well see you later Billy.\" \"Yeah bye.\"Billy left the hall and walked out on to the street. \"Alright Billy.\" came a voice to his left. \"Hey Michael, what are you doin' out here?\" \"Waiting for you, you stupid twat, me dad got pissed at me 'cause you stayed over, called me a filthy poof and told me to get out of his sight, so I came here. Thought you might have gone to see Mrs. Wilkinson.\" \"Well you'd be right, what do you want to do then?\" \"We could go sit under the bridge and you could show us some of your new moves.\" \"Alright then, but you have to do them as well.\" \"fair enough. Race you to the bridge.\" Both boys set of at full speed but by the time the reached the bridge, Michael was in the lead and won. The both leaned, panting against the dirty stone wall. \"You've gotten good.\" Billy said. \"Well, i've had to run the whole 2 miles in cross country now because you aren't here, it's no fun to cut through on me own.\" \"Oh sorry mikey, well atleast you got faster.\" \"Yeah, lucky me.\" \"What's the matter Michael? you've been acting weird the whole time I've been back.\" \"Oh, i'm sorry, i'm just used to being on me own, you know, 'cause everyone hates me and calls me a poof except Debbie but shes dead annoying so it's a bit hard to talk to anyone properly.\" \"You know i'm sorry for going away, like, dont you, but I had to, I can't stay here and be a miner like eerybody else.\" \"yeah, I know, I just wish I could come with you, see london and all that.\" \"Well why don't you then, just get enough money off of ya mam for the bus ticket and then you can stay in my room.\" \" Naah, yer alright, me mam would kill us if I left, not that me dad'd care, he's too pissed to notice me half the time and the other half, he just ignores me.\" \"Oh, It would be fun and you'd get away from Debbie 'cause god knows i want to.\" \"Yeah, you know she never shuts up about you, she fancies the pants off of you. I told her you don't like her back, you don't, do you?\" \"No, she's nice enough but I dont like her that way. You know she says that you're the one following her around, she doesn't seem to like you that much.\" Billy splashed his way across to the other side of the bridge. Michael followed him. \"No, she just feels sorry for me,I think, she doesn't understand that I want to be alone, 'cause i dont need any other friends, you're the best anyone can have.\" \"Thanks Michael, you're the best too, even if you are a bit weird somtimes.\" Billy once again reached over and kissed Michaels cheek. He jumed back in surprise. \"Bloody hell Billy, you need to stop doing that!\" Michael exclaimed. \"Why, I thought you liked it.\" \"I do, too much and thats the fuckin' problem! You did that before you left and the whole time you were gone, that's all i could bloody well think about, and then you come back, do it again and ask me why I'm acting weirdly. And the worst thing is that you don't mean anything by it 'cause your so bloody straight!\" Michael burst out. \"I think that is the most I've ever heard you say at once.\" \"AAAARRRRGGGGGHH! is that all you can say when I just poured my fuckin' heart out to you?\" \"So, what, do you fancy us, like.\" \"And FINALLY, he gets it! You're supposed to be the clever one! I thought you knew, or at least had some idea.\"Michaels voice became quieter, softer. \"Well, I thought about it once but kind of dismissed the idea. How long have you fancied us for then?\" Michael sunk to the ground against the wall with his head in his hands. \"Oh fuckin' hell you know how to ask difficult questions. Well, I don't really know, like. I always knew I was different, 'cause I liked dolls and dresses instead of football and boxing and I always knew that I liked you more than I probably should but I never really thought abut it as fancyin' you until like last year, all I thought about was that I liked it when you danced and when you taught me your moves and that I wanted to kiss you more than anything else in the world but I knew what people would say if they found out so I kept it quiet.\" Michael threw his head back against the wall and Billy was alarmed to see that he was crying. \"Oh, fuck, I'm sorry, I shouldn'ta said that, I've probably freaked you out and now you're gonna hate me.\" \"Divvint be so fuckin' stupid man, I don't hate you.\" Billy paused for a second. \"Thank you for tellin' me.\" \"my fuckin' pleasure.\" The two of them sat silently for a while. \" Michael?\" \"What?\" \"D'ya really wanna kiss me that much?\" \"What the fuck d'you think?\" \"oh, so why don't you?\" \"'cause you'd fuckin' kill me if I did.\" \"It was a rhetorical question you stupid little shit, I meant that you can, I mean, if you want to.\" \"Are you serious, man?\" \"yeah.\" \"you'd do that for me?\" \"'course I would, you're me best mate.\" Michael was silent for several seconds before replying: \"So, can I?\" \"Oh, chist on a bike, of course you fuckin' can, that was the whole point of this fuckin' conversation.\" \"You're beginning to sound like your Tony, you know that.\" \"Oh fuck off, so are you gonna kiss me or not?\" \"oh right then.\" Michael stood up and faced Billy, placing his hands on his shoulders. Then, very slowly, he leaned forward and pressed his lips to Billy's. It was very short, dry and rather salty because of Michaels tears, but it was amazing. Michael pulled back and turned away, licking his lips, searching for a taste of the other boy. \"Thanks.\" he said quietly. \"So, was it alright?\" Billy asked tenatively. \"Yeah, It was, what about for you?\" \"Yeah, it was okay, I guess.\" \"good.\" \"Yeah.\" \"look, I'd better get going, me dad'll be waiting for me.\" \"Alright then, see you Billy, and thanks.\" \"Your welcome, see you Michael.\" Michael sat back down against the wall, tears sliding down his face.

Je pouvais pas m'arrêter sur cette fin, c'était trop horrible pour moi, alors voilà je me lance en espérant que ça vous plaira ! Bonne lecture ! Billy c'était une nouvelle fois rendu à son entraînement de danse secrètement. Son professeur était Madame Wilkinson, la seule professeur de danse de la ville. Elle ne lui faisait plus payer ses cours depuis le jour où son père avait découvert qu'il s'y rendait à la place d'aller à son entraînement de boxe. Depuis ce jour, tous ses cours se passaient dans le secret le plus complet et totalement gratuitement. Madame Wilkinson trouvait Billy très talentueux, et il était impossible pour elle de le laisser abandonner pour l'ignorance de son père Jackie. Il avait inscrit Billy à la boxe dans l'espoir de les faire sortir de leur galère financières car lui et le grand frère de Billy, Tony, exerçait le même métier que tout le voisinage : Mineur. Bien trop peu payé et bien trop dangereux, une grève fût établie. Seules peu de personnes travaillaient et le père et le frère de Billy ne faisaient pas partis d'entre eux. Une seule personne savait que Billy prenait des cours de danses mis à part son professeur, c'était Michael. Le meilleur ami de Billy . Il lui faisait entièrement confiance et tout ça était réciproque. Son père travaillait aussi dans les mines, les deux garçons de 11 ans avaient donc à chaque réunion de grève l'occasion de s'enfuir en douce pour aller s'amuser. Michael était un garçon doux, gentil et naïf. Il était également inscrit à la boxe sous les ordres de son père, même si il détestait ce sport bien trop brutal de son point de vue. Leur deux tempéraments totalement différents ne leur empêche pas d'avoir une amitié horriblement solide. A la fin de son cours, Billy alla se changer dans les vestiaires puis il sortit rapidement du gymnase. C'est lorsqu'il entendit une voix l'appeler qu'il se tourna, c'était Michael. Il courrait vers lui. Billy se stoppa de marcher afin de l'attendre et c'est un peu essoufflé que le brun s'arrêta devant lui. -Alors, c'était bien ? Lui demanda-t-il tout en reprenant son souffle. -Bah, ouais ! Lui répondit Billy en souriant légèrement. Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ? -Bah je m'ennuyais alors j'ai voulu te faire une surprise ! Et je me suis dit que de venir te voir après ton entraînement ce serait cool ! Mais j'ai pas vu l'heure alors j'ai dû courir, expliqua Michael tout en affichant une petite moue déçue sur son visage. -C'est cool, Michael. Se contenta de dire Billy en souriant légèrement, comme pour le rassurer. -C'est cool que ce soit cool ! Enfin, c'est cool que tu trouves ça cool quoi ! -Oui, sûrement. Billy ria légèrement avant de continuer son chemin en compagnie de son meilleur ami. Il ne comprenait pas toujours Michael, il tenait sans cesse à lui faire plaisir avec un tas de petites surprises qu'il ratait la plupart du temps, mais c'était ce petit côté maladroit et attentionné qui rendait Michael unique. -En fait, Billy ! Je trouve ça cool que tu fasses de la danse moi, finit par dire le brun, brisant le silence qui s'était établi durant quinze bonnes secondes. -C'est pas si cool que ça, tu sais. C'est simplement quelques chose qui me plaît ! -Moi je trouve ça vraiment trop cool. -Eh ben, si tu trouves la danse aussi cool que ça, pourquoi tu ne te lances pas ? -Ca va pas ou quoi ! -Et pourquoi ? Répliqua Billy, un peu vexé par la réponse de son ami. -C'est pas contre toi Billy ! Mais toi tu es né pour faire ça, tu as du talent ! Tu es capable de faire de grandes choses, j'en suis sûr ! Puis chacun a quelques chose qui lui convient, dans la vie ! Toi c'est la danse ! On peut pas s'y mettre comme ça en claquant des doigts ! Il faut être né pour ça pour vraiment réussir ! Moi j'ai pas encore trouvé de vocation… Billy ne bougeait plus, il se contentait d'écouter attentivement Michael, totalement choqué par ce qu'il venait de dire. Ils se connaissaient depuis un bout de temps et Billy avait rarement eu l'occasion de voir le côté sérieux de Michael. Il s'exprimait toujours comme un enfant totalement niais mais Billy savait qu'au fond il était bien plus intelligent qu'il ne le faisait paraître. Il finit par lui sourire, tout en hochant la tête positivement. -Je suis impressionné par ta vision de la danse, Michael. -C'est toi qui m'a donné cette vision, répondit-il en souriant fièrement. -C'est touchant. Et tu trouveras toi aussi ta vocation, Michael. -Ca j'en sais rien… Je suis là pour faire de la boxe car ça fait plaisir à mon papa, c'est tout. Peut-être que ma vocation c'est de faire plaisir aux gens, et rien de plus. Et maintenant voilà que le Michael plus du tout inconscient de la vie prenait le dessus. Billy le regardait en plissant légèrement les yeux, peut-être que son meilleur ami n'était pas aussi facile à cerner qu'il n'y paraissait. -Peut-être que tu as raison, ta vocation est de faire plaisir aux gens, mais faire plaisir aux gens ça ne veut pas dire rester là à faire ce qu'ils aimeraient que tu fasses. Tu peux leur faire plaisir autrement. Il y a énormément de manière de faire plaisir aux gens. C'était désormais au tour de Michael d'écouter attentivement son ami, il le trouvait tellement intelligent… Il avait toujours les mots pour réconforter les gens. Peut-être qu'ils avaient 11 ans, mais leur relation avait de loin dépassé le stade des gamineries depuis bien longtemps. Peut-être qu'à cause de tout ce qui les entouraient, la grève, la police, les émeutes… Ces garçons avaient simplement grandit trop vite. Il leur arrivait de s'amuser comme des gamins, après tout, c'était ce qu'ils étaient. Mais quelquefois, il leur arrivait d'avoir des discussions sérieuses qui étaient loin d'être couramment abordées par des enfants de 11 ans. C'était peut-être pour cela qu'ils s'entendaient si bien. -T'as raison Billy, répondit Michael en hochant positivement la tête et en souriant. -Sur ce coup, oui ! -Pas que sur ce coup, tu as toujours raison. -N'abuses pas Michael, répondit Billy en riant légèrement, j'ai tord parfois aussi, tu sais. -Oui mais seulement quand tu te rabaisses. Sur ces mots, l'autre garçon regarda Michael en souriant légèrement. Leur relation était vraiment bizarre. Billy avait toujours été assez renfermé et avait du mal à faire confiance aux gens. Pourtant il n'avait presque aucun mal à se confier à Michael. Quant à Michael, il ne se comportait pas vraiment comme un ami vis à vis de Billy, il était toujours attentionné envers lui. Il tenait toujours à lui faire plaisir et essayait toujours de se mettre en valeur. Il aimait la façon dont Billy avait de le considérer comme autre chose qu'un simple pote parmi les autres. Il le considérait comme son meilleur ami et Michael aimait se sentir privilégié ainsi. -C'est gentil Michael, lui dit-il en souriant sincèrement. -C'est simplement ce que je pense ! -Michael, mon petit Michael. Il faudrait sérieusement que tu songes à muer, ta voix est tellement aigu, dit Billy en riant et en donnant une tape amicale à Michael. -Hé ! Va te faire foutre ! T'as même pas encore mué entièrement toi aussi ! Répliqua le brun d'un air légèrement vexé. -Roh ça va ! Moi j'ai la voix grave pour un garçon de 11 ans ! -Te ventes pas trop ! -C'est bien toi qui a dit que j'avais tord seulement lorsque je me rabaissais ! Répondit Billy en laissant apparaître un large sourire vainqueur sur son visage. -... T'as gagné Billy, répliqua Michael, d'un air légèrement blasé. -Comme toujours ! Ajouta le jeune garçon d'un air totalement fier. -Mouais... Bref. On se voit cet après-midi à l'école? -Comme tous les vendredis après-midi, Michael. -C'est vrai ! Bon, à toute à l'heure dans ce cas ! Le brun sourit une dernière fois à Billy avant de rentrer chez lui en courant. Il était toujours surexcité et passait la plupart de son temps sur les murets des maisons de la ville ou alors enfermé dans sa chambre sans que personne ne sache vraiment ce qui occupait ses journées. Quant à Billy, il passait son temps libre à répéter ses pas de danses ou à traîner dehors, cherchant désespérément une occupation. Mais surtout, les jeunes garçons passaient la plupart de leur temps libre en commun ensemble. Billy finit par se rendre à l'école à l'heure, comme la plupart du temps. C'était un assez bon élève. Seuls les problèmes de violences affectaient gravement à sa scolarité. Le jeune garçon avait beaucoup de mal à se maîtriser et tapait souvent sur ses camarades lorsque ceux-ci emmerdaient lui ou Michael. Mais en classe, il se montrait calme, discret et intelligent. Ce qui n'était pas le cas de Michael qui n'était pourtant pas du tout violent. Il avait juste tendance à être un peu trop bavard ou distrait. Il était naïf et ne se rendait pas compte de la plupart de ses bêtises. Billy était assis à l'avant dernière rangée de la salle de classe, il attendait Michael qui ne semblait pas arriver. Après 10 bonnes minutes de cours, le petit brun débarqua enfin. -Excusez moi de mon retard madame.. bredouilla-t-il. -Tiens donc, Michael, dit la grosse femme qui leur servait de professeur en se levant de sa chaise, quelle raison stupide avez-vous trouvé aujourd'hui pour arriver en retard à l'école et sécher lâchement les cours? Finit-elle sur un ton totalement méprisant, fixant le brun d'un regard noir. -Eh bien, madame, vous allez rire mais... -Oui, telle que vous me voyez je suis vraiment d'humeur à rire, le coupa-t-elle d'un air totalement blasé. Continuez. -J'étais chez moi et à mon plus grand re.. remo.. Regret ou remord..? Bredouilla encore une fois Michael, totalement mal à l'aise. -Laissez tomber, ne prenez peine de vous justifier. A mon plus grand regret, ou remord, comme bon vous semblera, vous me copierez 100 fois pour demain : \"Je n'arrive pas en retard en classe pour rater lâchement un morceau du cours et ne trouve pas d'excuses totalement ridicules à dire à mon professeur afin de faire preuve d'insolence envers lui.\" -Je.. Quoi? Mais c'est trop long madame ! -SILENCE ! Hurla-t-elle de sa voix aigu ce qui manqua de provoquer une otite à toute la salle de classe, ASSEYEZ VOUS ET NE VOUS JUSTIFIEZ PAS MICHAEL ! -Bien.. Finit-il tout en allant s'asseoir à sa place habituelle qui se trouvait derrière celle de Billy. Puis le professeur continua son cours après avoir jeté un dernier regard noir à toute la classe, Michael profita du fait que Billy était de dos à lui pour le fixer, posant son coude sur la table et son menton contre la paume de sa main. Il détourna rapidement le regard sur ses stylos lorsque Billy se tourna vers lui. -Tu l'as bien foutu de mauvaise humeur... chuchota-t-il en essayant d'être le plus discret possible. -Quand est-ce que tu l'as vu de bonne humeur, toi? Répliqua le brun avant de lâcher un petit rire. -... Jamais. Cette fois c'est toi qui a raison, petit con à la voix d'un gamin de 5 ans. -Ta gueule ! Répondit le brun en donnant un coup de règle en métal sur le front de son ami. -Aïe ! Mais t'es con ou quoi? Lui dit-il tout en se frottant le front et en ne pouvant pas s'empêcher d'esquisser un petit sourire. -Je crois bien que o... -ELIOTT ET CAFFREY ! DANS LE BUREAU DU PRINCIPAL ! Hurla à nouveau le professeur, brisant la conversation de Billy et Michael. Et sans plus attendre ils se levèrent et sortirent de la classe en courant. Il n'eurent qu'à se lancer un regard complice suivi d'un sourire que eux seuls connaissaient et ils sortirent rapidement de l'école sans se rendre dans le bureau du fameux principal, en éclatant de rire. Voiloou. Pour l'instant rien de bien intéressant mais je préférais faire un début sobre :) j'espère que ça vous plaira.

After all, why would he bloody care if Billy wanted to dance, when he regularly pulled up ladies' knickers round his thighs? Michael had been nice, serene, cool, and confident in himself and Billy. Then why had he started feeling left out? \"So how's the dancin' goin' along, Billy?\" Billy shrugged, shoving his ballet shoes down the front of his boxing shorts. \"Couldn't be better,\" he mumbled distractedly, adjusting them so they wouldn't be entirely visible. Michael had noticed how Billy normally hid things down his pants; it was effective, sure, as no one was meant to be looking down there, but Michael found himself watching Billy while he did it. \"Bug off; you're bloody obsessed,\" said Michael, and then met Billy's eyes when he finally looked up. He smiled. \"Yeah, I suppose it's pretty wicked.\" They started toward the door, Michael bringing up the rear rather slowly. When they'd closed the door to Billy's home, Billy said, \"Would you like to come to my practice, Michael?\" Michael felt very warm inside, and nodded. Maybe, after all, he'd been too antsy about being left out? \"Come on then, you bugger,\" Billy said happily, and Michael was dragged by his friend the whole way to the makeshift ballet studio. When they came in after making sure no one from boxing knew Billy was there, Michael said, \"Seriously, though; do you get to wear a tutu?\" \"Aw, Michael; you're talking like a poof.\" \"I not a poof,\" Michael said faintly. \"Then don't ask me if I get to wear a tutu —alright, mate?\" Billy was grinning, but Michael wasn't finding it entirely funny. \"Just—come on.\" Together they made their way to the boxing ring in silence. There, Mrs. Wilkinson met them, and shook Michael's hand warmly. \"Who might this be?\" Billy's grin was blinding—to Michael, at least. \"This is Michael; he wanted to come and watch us practice.\" \"You interested in dancin', too, then, Lad?\" Michael smiled weakly. \"No, not really, Ma'am.\" \"Call me 'Miss', please.\" \"No thanks, then, Miss,\" Michael said, giving Billy a sideways glance. \"I'm no good at dancin'.\" \"I've never seen ya dance,\" said Billy, and right then Michael could have smacked him. \"Who's to say you're not utterly brilliant at dancin'?\" \"I'm sure I'm not,\" Michael said quietly, and averted his attention to the stark white walls. Suddenly, he wished he was at home, regardless of a mad, drunken father or not. It almost wasn't fair, watching Billy dancing like he was a born-ready professional, and . . . just watching. Sometimes he wished he could join in, but he was no good with the dancing. And having Billy push him to try was . . . embarrassing. \"Come on, dearie, give it a go,\" Mrs. Wilkinson said encouragingly, holding out her hand for Michael to grasp. Michael hesitated; wouldn't it be amazing to be able to join in with Billy, to dance with him? Michael knew Billy was special, knew he was likely going to move on with bigger and better things. Michael also knew that he, probably, would be left at home, working the mines. But to dance, to learn . . . to stay with Billy. . . . \"I can't dance, Miss,\" he said firmly. Compared to Billy, he'd look like a flailing goose. Mrs. Wilkinson groaned, irritated, and lit herself a match. Michael's dad smoked, too. He hated it. \"Jus' give a try, will ya?\" Michael, without thinking, reached out and grabbed Billy's hand. He felt Billy stiffen, and Mrs. Wilkinson's eyes fluttered down to where Michael's hand was laced with Billy's. Then he felt Billy's eyes on his face, looked up quickly, and saw his stony expression: tight lips; wide, confused eyes; and knee-locked legs. He looked surprised. Michael's heart sped up. He began to feel ill, let go of Billy's hand, and said evenly, \" I can't dance , Miss.\" Then, he turned around, spinning slightly, and ran out without thinking about anything else. Michael barreled down the street, feeling light-headed, and then rounded the corner, desperately hoping Billy wasn't running after him like he knew he was. A moment later, Billy screamed, always true to self, \" Slow down , you bag of shit!\" Michael allowed himself to look over his shoulder; Billy was quickly gaining on him, arms pumping at his sides, his strong legs propelling him forward. He was startled at how fast Billy was, so he looked forward again and shrieked. Michael stopped his legs from moving, stopped himself entirely, and a millisecond later, Billy's arms closed around him, ultimately stopping him from plummeting headfirst into heavy traffic. \"What the hell d'you think you're doing!\" he was yelling furiously, dragging Michael back to safety. \"You bastard !\" Billy forced Michael's head around. \"Honestly, have you gone mad ! What's wrong with you?\" Michael's eyes shifted down the length of Billy's body, noticing how close they were. Then he shook himself. \"Sorry, Mate.\" \"You better be,\" Billy growled, standing up. \"What in hell's name was that back there? And then runnin' like I was gonna bite your bloody head off 'cause ya didn't want to dance?\" Billy took a deep breath, and held his hand out. \"Look . . . sorry, Mate.\" Michael begrudgingly took his friend's hand. \"It's just—that was a bit wild,\" Billy said, trying to force a laugh. \"For a moment, I thought you were trying to make a desperate attempt at suicide—I ran balls to the wall to get you out before your brains were on the road.\" \"Sorry, Mate,\" Michael repeated. Billy nodded, quieting down, and bit down on his lip hard. \"Will you come back with me?\" \"You know, Billy,\" Michael said quietly, \"I don't think that I want to.\" He looked away. \"I'll see ya tomorrow . . . okay?\" Billy blinked several times. \"Yeah . . . okay. See you, Michael.\"[Chapter 2] I was nervous. Never had I ever. . . . A week or so ago, I'd stupidly asked Mrs. Wilkinson if she fancied me—but that was mostly because of Debbie, tellin' me her mum did dancin' 'stead of sex. I'd thought that was odd, so I'd asked her if she fancied me, only because of her touchin' me . . . you know, showing me dancin' moves. I'd been a little uncomfortable at the time, and with Debbie tellin' me 'bout the whole sex-for-ballet trade, it had thrown me a bit over the top. But this—this was shittin' insane. This was a whole new bloody complication. Aye, I'd been stupid. And aye, I'd give up boxin' for ballet like a right sissy. . . . But that didn't mean I was a poof? Did it? When I came home after dancin' our nana was asleep sittin' up, in front of the fire. I wanted to move her, fearin' a good beatin' if I didn't, but she looked too peaceful. Da and Tony weren't home, so I could leave her. And since I was being outright defiant already, I also figured it would be safe to play a record or two. \"I Love to Boogie\" was me favourite, so I put it on and was able to choreograph a whole new dance in two hours before Da and Tony got back. In record time, not to mention. An' I was even able to get our nana in bed, too. She put up a fight, the old biddy, but I managed fairly quickly. An' , surprise, bloody surprise, I was in me bed when they walked through the door. I considered it me own personal triumph. Now, if only I could figure my Michael out an' what to do with him, then I would have to call meself a wizard . . . or somethin'. * * * The next day, I was none too surprised to find Michael tappin' on my window impatiently like he did on most weekends. It was seven O'clock in the mornin', Saturday, but I knew Da and Tony weren't home. Michael wouldn't 'ave dared knock on me window unless they were out. Thank God. Hoppin' out of bed, still dressed in clothes I'd worn last night, I carefully and slowly slid open the squeaky window with as much care as possible (force of habit), and eased meself up on the roof, bottom first. Michael was there and pulled me up so I wouldn't dive headfirst onto the pavement below. Michael was smilin' much like he hadn't been yesterday, and I wondered if he'd simply gotten over the whole incidnent. It would save me a load of crap, going through the 'Big Talk' I had all planned up and ready to spew out—but I could still talk with 'im if he needed it. He had certainly needed it last night. . . . But last night I hadn't had me 'Big Talk' plan. Today I did and of course the little bugger was feelin' all better. Typical. \"Hey, Michael,\" I said, fightin' to get me land legs so high up. \"Hey, Mate,\" he said, ready to catch me if I looked like I was about to fall. I didn't fall, thank bloody God, and we grinned at each other awkwardly, jumpin' down to another part of the townhouse like the experts we were. \"So,\" Michael said, concentrating on his climbin'. \"So?\" \"Me dad still says that I'm a hopeless git,\" Michael said. \"S'like the fifth time this week.\" \"Yeah—I'll be damned should that be right,\" I said. \"Tell 'im to piss off.\" \"I can't just tell me father to piss off, you know.\" \"Ya can try —I've wanted to tell me father to piss off all me life.\" \"That'll go down the ruddy shiter.\" \"Then you'll go down the shiter yourself, I s'pose.\" Michael frowned. \"I feel I've been down the shiter at least once ev'ry fortnight—s'nothing new.\" \"Looks like your bleedin' screwed then, Mate.\" He kept frowning. \"You got any ket?\" \"Sod off, ya ugly bastard.\" * * * \"Where've ya been?\" me Da asked, soon as I stepped inside. \"With our Michael—wa'n't any boxin' today.\" \"I found your nana wan'drin' about outside—make sure you're here next time, an' stop pissin' about.\" Da looked mad, but didn't take it farther. I couldn't be bothered much. \"She's not only me nana—Tony's, too,\" I muttered under me breath. He heard me anyway—figures with that annoyin' sod. \"I dun know why you're hangin' about that pansy anyway.\" \"He's not a pansy, Da.\" \"A bloody tart, he is.\" I rolled me eyes, but didn't say anythin'. This argument was lost. ","Summary":" Throughout everything, Michael had been nice, supportive, and understanding. After all, why would h"},{"Movie":"Billy Elliot","Title":"Michael","Author":"Serendipitous-Slug","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6130355","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Walking up the stone steps to the theater Michael was suddenly aware of the ruckus his heart was making in his chest. It had been at least four years since they had last seen each other and all he could remember was their goodbye. That kiss on the cheek and the tears that had come after. Of course he had been young then, and what did that matter when they 17 now. But there were those letters over the years, it didn't seem like anything changed. Billy was still that same goofy, brave kid. And Michael was…well he didn't know what he was in more than one way. When he reached the shining double doors he stopped taking a deep breath. After adjusting his worn and patched \"Sunday best\" and glaring at his scuffed shoes he walked through. Immediately he was engulfed in to a crowded room full of people dressed in suits and gowns. Feeling horribly under dressed Michael made his way into an empty corner. From there he could get the full picture of the room. Along the walls were framed posters of the Royal Ballet School, most picturing Billy. It was then that Michael realized this was really the first time he had seen how Billy looked after all these years. His dirty blonde hair was longer now, and he was taller, more filled out. His arms especially, from lifting all the ballerinas Michael guessed. Michael looked into his reflection of a nearby window. His own arms were thin, matching the rest of his lanky body. Plain black hair and brown eyes stared back at him. Michael looked around the room again and couldn't help but feel inferior. He was just from a little miner's town; these people were most likely all from London. Before his embarrassment and jealously could grow, the lights flickered signaling for the people to file into the theater. Trying not to bump into the growing crowd, Michael made his way to the usher taking tickets who gave him a look suggesting he didn't belong there.[Chapter 2] As Michael entered the theater he felt his nerves leave him, too distracted by the beauty of the theater. Rows and rows of plush purple chairs sat like thrones. Above, several balconies with matching purple curtains sat women in fur coats smoking imported cigarettes. He gazed above the smoke cloud to the crisp white marble ceiling. It was carved in intricate designs, swirling into the center where a large crystal chandelier hung. Michael had never seen anything more beautiful in his life and he stood there looking at until the usher said, \"Move 'er along now.\" poking him in the back with a flashlight. Michael ripped his eyes away from the chandelier and found his seat. It was a tight fit, between a large man and an even larger woman, and it was towards the back of the theater. Michael smiled thinking back to Billy's letter, \"I'm sorry I can't get you a better seat or nuffing but, me' Da' and Tony came last performance and well, the theater people are a bunch of stingy snobs, aren't they?\" The lights blinked a few times and then, slowly dimmed until only soft light came from the crystal chandelier. A hush swept across the packed theater and once it was completely quiet, music began. Michael watched the conductor, at first mistaking him for a dancer. Once he realized that the orchestra was concealed in a sort of dug out, the velvet curtains opened. The stage was done up as if it were a forest, a ballerina in a crisp white tutu (that Michael envied) stood on her toes center stage. She then began to shuffle, other ballerinas in pink fluttered out from behind bushes and trees and danced along with the ballerina in white. Michael tried to follow the story line but after a while found himself lost. Instead of trying to understand, he watched avidly at the fluid motions each girl made. Suddenly, the music went from soft violins to booming drums and deep basses as a figure in black crept from behind a tree and pounced on the white ballerina. He picked her up, flung her over his shoulder; she balanced and then fell, only to be caught up by him again. They danced in this same pattern, the man in black trying to embrace the ballerina and her failing to escape. As Michael watched, it seemed to be that time had passed, but the while ballerina was still captive. Hisses from the crowd sounded when the man in black slapped the white ballerina across the face and she fell, strewn across a rock, her shoulders shaking with tears. The man in black stalked off the stage to be replaced with sad and slow music. The white ballerina peeled herself from the rock, dancing along to the melancholy melody. She was so distracted, twirling and leaping, that she didn't notice another man, also dressed in white, walking on stage. He watched her and then began to dance behind her. When she turned around to see him she tried to run but he grasped her wrist. They began danced together, the music altering to include violas and flutes, building up. The two, now lovers, ran from each other, only to turn back. The white ballerina leaped into his arms and he raised her above his head as the music exploded and the crowd erupted. The man put the ballerina down and they both bowed. When they came up, Michael squinted and gasped. Billy.

I'm Sireiko, I love writing stories and I do hope you'll enjoy them with me. Thank you to my beta reader and best friend: Rainflurry The ride to Royal Ballet school was comfortable, but lonely. Everybody except for myself knew each other. Just a week ago, a letter from the Royal Ballet school came and told me that I have been accepted to school. My name is Billy Elliot and I am 11 years old. I live with my dad, brother and grandmother. My mother died when I was 9. I miss her so much. And I know I'll miss her forever. My dad and brother had worked so hard for this opportunity. At first they had seemed to be angry because they were those types of people who love boxing and football. I guess that's why they were angry at me for even trying to learn ballet. But at last they had finally understood how I wanted to learn and that I was actually good at it. The bus made a sudden curve and I was snapped out of my thoughts. I looked out to the window, and I saw a big, beautiful building. It said \" Royal Ballet School\". I was so nervous that I thought I would puke. I went out of bus and saw dozens of teachers in line waiting for the students to get out. The teacher in the middle was fat and seemed to radiate a commanding attitude, making it seem as if she was the principal. I noticed her from the audition I had. She looked more grumpy than when I had first seen her. Maybe she was tired, I thought to myself. She glanced at me and smiled. She seemed extremely nice, especially her eyes. When she smiles her wrinkles gather around them. I smiled back at her. I scanned the line and saw another man who looked as nice as her. It almost looked like as if he was her son. But all the teachers except for them looked mean. I glanced back to look at the students of line next to me. They all looked kind of mean and two of them did seem as if they weren't someone to mess with. One of them had brown curly hair and was skinny and small. Other one was blonde. He was skinny for his height and was very, very tall. When he noticed that I was looking at him, he glared at me and looked away. \" Hi. I'm Billy. Billy Elliot.\" I found myself introducing to him. I didn't know why. I just did. He looked really surprised and somehow smiled at me. He looked very kind when he smiled. I guess he looked kind of mean at first because he was nervous. He replied \" I am Charles Parker. Nice to meet you. \" I was so anxious, but happy now that he actually seems nice. I guess I might be able to be friend with him. Maybe, the other guy that looks mean might be kind too. So, I decided to talk to him, \" Hello. I am Billy Elliot. Where are you from?\" I said to the curly brown haired boy. He looked at me and said, \"What do you want? I know there will be some purpose if some stranger is being friendly to you. I am not stupid you know.\" I was very stunned and stared at him for a second. I looked down at my dusty shoes. Suddenly I heard someone talking behind me. \"Just because a stranger is friendly to you that doesn't mean that they always have a purpose, Brayden.\" Then Charlie rolled his eyes. Brayden glared at both of us and said \"Wait until you see me dance. I'm gonna beat you both.\" This time I rolled my eyes and then Charlie and I started cracking up. Brayden raised his eyebrow and walked away. Charlie and I tried to stop chuckling when the principal made a step forward and called \"Attention, please.\" and made a eye contact with everybody. I wonder how she does that. \"I am glad to see new people trying ballet. Some people might need a lot of practice, but I am sure all of you will do very great.\" Brayden smirked as if he wanted to shout out that he will do a great job. I don't know if this actually happened, but it kind of looked like the principal glared at Brayden for just a second. Next chapter will be up tonight![Chapter 2] And I'm back xD... Told you it would be quick... Oh and excuse some of my grammar, English is not my first language. There was a blonde boy that looked sensitive who was sitting on a bed. I knew that he would be my roommate because this is supposed to be me and my roommate's room. I introduced myself to him. \"Hello! I'm Billy Elliot. I guess I'm your roommate.\" I stretched my hand for him to shake. He ignored it and just said \" I'm Edward. I really have to study and don't you dare disturb me, because I'll kill you if you do that.\" I was speechless and stood there for something to happen, which felt so long. And suddenly, he smiled at me \" Oh, I am sorry if what I said hurt your feelings, I was just so nervous. I didn't want to come to a weird stupid Ballet School, but my mom made me. And somehow, I got in to this school on audition.\" I thought of punching him in the face, but I managed to control myself. \" What I wanted you to do was that you wouldn't disturb me while I study. We can be good roommates if we don't disturb each other. I am sure we will.\" And he came up to me and surprisingly, hugged me. I was not too surprised because my old friend Michael back from my old town was like that too. It was kind of awkward though. I think he might be kind of crazy because he had all these weird posters all over his wall sing things like: \" Math is the best\", \" Without mathematics, there's nothing you can do. Everything around you is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers.\". It looks like he also have a lot of books to read, because there were piles of books piled up on his bed. I started to unpack. I was too sleepy to do something else, so I just took shower and crawled into my bed. As soon as I covered myself in a blanket, I started to sleep. I dreamed about my mother. How it might had been like if she was still alive. I woke up in the dead of the night, but went back to sleep again. My dad and my brother was in my second dream. They were working in coal mines and suddenly the ceiling of the cave fell down on them. I tried to run at them, but I wasn't able to move like there was a wall between us. I woke up screaming very loudly. I wasn't able to go back to sleep after that. I know these are short but this is all I have time for now with school. ","Summary":" Hi guys!

This is my first fan-fiction, so let's see how it goes! Standard disclaimers apply- I don't own Billy Elliot. Enjoy! :) Billy smiled at the letter. Only two more days. Then he would finally go home. It wasn't that Billy didn't want to be at the Royal Ballet School. He recognized that he was lucky to have gotten in, and that it wasn't cheap to be there, either. Every day was magical, and he was certainly living his dream, but he missed his small mining town. London was a great, big, beautiful city, which could be overwhelming sometimes. He needed a break from the constant noise. And home meant seeing Dad and Grandma and Tony again. And Mrs. Wilkinson, he couldn't wait to show her what he'd learned. And Debby and the other girls in his old ballet class. And Michael. He'd finally get to see Michael. Michael had written the letter Billy was holding, which he had already read at least ten times. Billy's eyes lingered on the last line. I can't wait to see you, dancing boy. \"I can't wait to see you either, Michael.\" Billy whispered. The door creaked open just then, and Billy set down the letter. \"Oi, Billy! We're going out for coffee, wanna come?\" Billy's friend and roommate, Nathan, invited him. \"Aye!\" Billy put Michael's letter in his bag, and left with his friends. The walk to the coffee shop was short, and accompanied by loads of laughter and conversation. Nathan, Zara, and Emily had become some of Billy's closest friends during the time they had been dancing together. Their shared love of ballet immediately gave them something that they had in common. After getting to know each other, they realized that their personalities clicked. Nathan was loud and outgoing, almost like Michael, but not nearly as cute. Zara had a great sense of humor, and would make fun of herself and her friends constantly. Somehow, she managed to do so without ever hurting anyone. Emily was quiet and cared about her studies. They would joke that she was the mom of the group, always making sure that everyone followed the rules and did what was best. She was American, and it was funny to see her accent mix with those around her. Billy's geordie accent, and the London accent that weaved its way through Nathan and Zara's voices were all a stark contrast. Once the group of four arrived at the coffee shop, Zara ordered their drinks while the others found a place to sit. They decided on a small table in the corner. \"So, are you lot ready for break?\" Nathan asked. Billy had only been at the school for a short time, but Spring break was already approaching. \"Definitely,\" Emily replied. \"I love dancing and all, but I'm ready for a few days off. And I have written enough essays to last me a lifetime. This is a much needed vacation.\" \"No kidding about the essays, they're a load of shite,\" Billy added. \"I'm excited to go home, too. I want to visit my old ballet teacher. And I'm thrilled to be able to see Michael again.\" Just then, Zara came back to the table and started passing out drinks. \"Ooh, did I hear someone say 'Michael'?\" She gave Billy a playful punch on the shoulder. \"Dude, you have got to learn to control that crush. Does he even know you like him?\" \"I don't know. We haven't actually talked about it since I left. I mean, it's not really something that's easy to talk about through writing. We'll probably talk over break.\" Nathan felt the need to add his input. \"You better. Doesn't he still think you're straight?\" Billy sighed. \"I don't know that, either. I mean, when he kissed me-\" \"He kissed you?\" \"Just on the cheek, but yeah. That was kind of how he told me he was gay. I told him that liking ballet didn't make me a poof, and that was really the end of the conversation. But then I kissed him before I left, so hopefully he got the message.\" \"Well, I wish you the best of luck, my friend.\" Nathan said. Emily gave a sympathetic smile. The conversation shifted after that. They talked about school, homework, plans for break, and every other thing they could think of. Throughout the conversation, Billy tried to forget about Michael. After all, his new friends were there to support and listen to him. It was only fair to give them the same respect. After about an hour, the group decided to go to the library to study for their exams the next day. There was more studying and homework at the Royal Ballet School than Billy had ever experienced before. When the people at the audition said they expected excellence, they certainly weren't kidding. \"What did you guys get for 13?\" Emily asked, after the students had been working for several minutes. Billy gave her a look of shock. \"You're already on 13? You must be a fucking genius to have gotten that far.\" \"Thank you for noticing.\" Emily smiled. I did some last night, though. I'm not that fast.\" The group continued to work until Billy declared that he'd had enough. \"Do you guys want to work on pirouettes or something? I mean, we are here to dance, aren't we?\" Nathan agreed, but the girls wanted to stay, Emily insisting that she only had a few more pages she needed to read for her history class. \"You go on ahead. We'll join you in a few minutes.\" Nathan and Billy walked to the dance studio, leaving the others behind. \"So, any plans for break?\" Billy asked, trying to start a conversation. When he was with Michael, it always seemed to flow naturally. Even though Billy had great new friends, he couldn't say the same about them. \"I don't think I'm really doing anything exciting,\" Nathan sighed. \"I hated my old bloody dance teacher, so I won't be visiting her. She didn't like me either, said male dancers were weird.\" \"My dad thought the same thing,\" Billy said, remembering when he first discovered his love of dance. \"Yeah, my parents don't really care. I told them I wanted to be a dancer when I was really little. My older sister was doing tap, and I was fascinated when I saw their recital. They were fine with it. My sister quit the next year.\" \"Why?\" \"She just got into other stuff. Can't stay focused on anything. I think she does tennis now.\" \"Oh.\" Billy didn't know what else to say. He liked Nathan, but wished he was talking to Michael. He was more comfortable with Michael. They'd known each other longer. They understood each other. After a few awkwardly silent minutes, the boy's walked into a slightly crowded dance studio. Classical music was playing quietly. The large room had a mirror on one wall, and several barres on one side of the wide open space. The other was left clear, with plenty of room to dance. It was one of the many practice rooms, but Nathan's favorite. Billy had tried to ask why several times (the rooms all seemed basically the same to him), but Nathan had always said that the preference was something he couldn't really explain. They started by warming up with some partner stretches. Nathan was more flexible than Billy, a result of his years of experience. Still, though, there's only so much a small child can be taught. Both boys were at the school to improve and learn from the instructors and each other. Next they did a few demi-plies and releves, before extending to full plies. They practiced first through fifth positions and some arm movements before finally deciding they were ready to start. Just as the boys were getting in to position to practice a routine they had been working on, Emily and Zara walked in. While they warmed up, the two girls watched Billy and Nathan. \"Straight legs Billy!\" Zara shouted. \"Well if he isn't, how do you expect his legs to be?\" Nathan joked. Billy rolled his eyes. \"Only kidding, friend. On a serious note though, you shouldn't be bending your knees. It looks incredibly sloppy.\" \"I know, I know.\" Billy knew it looked sloppy. That was one of the first things he'd been taught. He heard Mrs. Wilkinson's voice in his head. You have to concentrate. You're not even trying. He pictured himself doing the routine flawlessly. You can do this. Do it for Michael. This is the reason you left him. It better be good. \"You know Billy, I bet you're distracted because you're so busy thinking about Michael.\" Zara teased. Billy denied it at first, but Zara gave him a disapproving look. Billy admitted that maybe he wasn't completely focused. They tried the routine again, with the girls joining them. Billy really tried that time, and they managed to go through all they had learned without stopping. The friends agreed that it was one of their best run-throughs. Nevertheless, they did it a second time. At the end of the second time, they found themselves in a competition to see who could do the most pirouettes in a row, which Billy won, although Emily was not far behind. Afterwards, the group decided to practice one of their older routines that they all already knew by heart. Billy felt the electricity pounding through him as he danced. His favorite part was the pirouettes. Near the end, he had a solo, and did as many as he could. In that moment, he felt as though he were truly flying. He felt a smile spread across his face involuntarily while danced with his friends. He lifted Emily after she did a leap. When they had first started learning, he was afraid he would drop her, or miss catching her completely. Eventually, those fears had faded. Catching flying girls became the most natural thing in the world. They continued dancing until dinner. Then they stopped for a quick meal in the dining hall and went back to the rehearsal studio directly afterward. After another half hour, the four friends were the only students left practicing. Zara proclaimed herself too tired to continue, and lied down in the middle of the open area. \"I'm done. Goodnight.\" Emily laughed. \"That reminds me of when I learned how to do grand jetes. My instructor would lay down like that and have us all leap over her.\" \"Really? Me too.\" Nathan said. Billy felt his face heat up. His friends all obviously had so much more experience. He'd only been dancing for a few months. \"I don't care about how you blokes learned to do grand jetes! It's too late at night to be discussing such things. I am trying to sleep.\" \"Zara, it's 7:30.\" Billy said. \"Then 7:30 is my bedtime.\" \"We have been working for a while. I think I'm ready to call it a night. You guys?\" Emily looked to Billy and Nathan. \"Aye,\" Billy said. \"I should study more for exams tomorrow.\" Billy had never been very studious until he started classes at the Royal Ballet. \"There's really no point in staying if you all want to go.\" Nathan led the way to the door. Billy noticed Zara still on the floor. \"Are you alright?\" \"No, too... much... dancing.\" \"Here.\" Billy helped Zara on to his back to carry her to the dorms. \"You know Billy?\" \"M-hm?\" \"You'd be a great boyfriend if you weren't such a poof.\" Billy shook his head. \"Shut up.\" Billy shared a room with Nathan, so they walked in together. Each of them studied on their own. Once his head became more filled with thoughts of Michael than arithmetic, Billy decided to pull out Michael's letter. Dear Billy, It sounds like you're having a lot of fun at dancing school. Your friends seem like a lot of fun. Especially Zara. I'm okay, but I really do miss you. Sometimes I wish you never left, but I know that you're doing what's best for you. I don't have too many friends, but sometimes I hang out with Debby. She fancies you and never stops talking about it. Sometimes it's a little annoying. I haven't told her that you're coming back to visit. I guess you can just surprise her. Anyway, I'm excited for you to come back. Maybe you can teach me some ballet again. We could even wear tutus! I know everyone says they're just for lasses, but, hey- What the hell's wrong with expressing yourself? Me mam caught me wearing one of me sister's dresses yesterday. I don't think she was pleased, but I don't care. She's a bloody idiot anyway. I hope you're really having a good time at ballet school. I can't wait to see you, dancing boy. Your best friend, Michael Caffrey The choppy collection of sentences never failed to make Billy smile. Not because the letter was a happy one, but because it was written by Michael. \"Is that from Michael?\" Billy jumped a little when he heard Nathan's voice behind him. \"Aye.\" \"You really like him, don't you?\" \"Aye. He's been my best mate for years. I can't wait to see him.\" \"You fancy him?\" Billy looked up at Nathan. \"Of course. He's adorable. Not just in looks, but personality, too.\" \"Well,\" Nathan said. \"Only one more day.\" \"Yeah,\" Billy repeated. \"One more day.\" Thank you so much for reading this. Please, please, please review. I'm a little worried that this moved too quickly, but this chapter is just setting the stage for the rest of the story. On a different note, you will definitely see Michael in future chapters. I just noticed that there wasn't much fan-fiction exploring Billy's time at school, so I wanted to start with that. Thanks again! -Ferocious Fangirl[Chapter 2] Hello friends! Thank you for coming back to read the second chapter! Also, thank you so much to everyone who has supported this story in any way (by reviewing, favoriting, following, reading it, all that jazz). I wasn't really expecting anyone to read this at all, so I'm so happy to see that some people are. In this chapter, I reference a scene in the movie where Billy starts teaching Michael to dance. That scene didn't happen in the musical, so if you haven't seen the movie, just know that it happens right after the Christmas scene. This chapter alternates viewpoints between Billy and Michael, which was a lot of fun to write. Enjoy! The last bell finally rang. Billy and his friends ran out of their final class, excited for two weeks off. In an hour, the train would come, and Billy would go home to Everington. Then there would be a two hour ride before he would finally be home. Only three more hours. Nathan hugged his three friends. \"See you in two weeks,\" and was gone. Billy looked to Zara and Emily. \"Aren't you guys leaving, too?\" \"No,\" Emily replied. \"Zara's mom is coming in an hour. We knew the train didn't come until then, and didn't want you to be lonely.\" \"Thanks.\" Billy smiled. He'd miss his friends over break. \"What do you guys want to do until then?\" \"Do you want to just go for a walk or something?\" Emily asked. \"That sounds like a brilliant idea!\" Zara said. She grabbed hold of both of her friends' hands, and started running to a path next to the nearby lake. Only three more hours. Then he'd finally get to see Billy. Michael stared at the alarm clock by his bed. Five o'clock. Billy would get home at eight. Would it be awkward when he finally got home? The two friends hadn't seen each other in months. It would probably be awkward. Michael couldn't help but expect the worst, but a few positive thoughts still managed to worm their way into his head. Maybe it would be perfect. Michael imagined Billy running up to him, greeting him with a hug. Or maybe even a kiss. Who could say? He knew his thoughts were childish, but he couldn't help the happy daydreams. What would they do when Billy finally got home? Michael remembered the one night that Billy tried to teach him to dance. That was fun. Maybe they could do it again? Michael was thrown out of his daydream when he heard his sister's voice. \"Oi, Michael, Can you- What are you wearing?\" Hannah's voice was interrogating. Michael glanced down at the pink floral-print dress he was wearing that had been borrowed from Hannah's closet. He hadn't prepared for the moment, but still managed to explain his attire calmly. \"I was just... dressing up.\" Hannah sat down next to him on his bed. \"Look, I'm not mad, and I'm only saying this because I care about you, but dresses are for girls. I don't know if you've worn my clothes before, but people are gonna think you're a poof if you keep doing it. I don't really blame you though, being friends with Billy. Boys who choose to dance aren't-\" \"Don't make fun of Billy! He's my friend.\" Michael's voice wavered. \"I know it's hard to understand, and that you think he's your friend, but it's not natural for boys to dance. Maybe it's good that he left for school. It'll keep him away from you. I don't want you turning into a poof, too.\" \"That's not how it works.\" Michael tried to get his sister to understand. He desperately needed her to stop. Hannah gave him a condescending look. \"Just go change clothes. And give me my dress back when you're done.\" \"What if I'm already a poof?\" The room was silent. Michael felt ice-cold as he waited for the response. Hannah stared at her brother. After a few painstakingly long seconds, she muttered two words with firm determination. \"You're not.\" \"But say I was.\" \"Just… don't be.\" Hannah left the room. \"So, any plans for break?\" Emily asked Billy as they began their walk by the river. \"Not really.\" Billy looked at the water. Such a clear, beautiful blue. It was calming. There weren't really any lakes back home. Michael would like to see the water. He loved bright, vibrant, colors. \"Billy, are you okay? You haven't really seemed like yourself today.\" Concern weaved its way through Emily's voice. \"Yeah. I guess I'm just… nervous? I mean, I want to talk to Michael when I get home, but I don't bloody know what I'm going to say. I want to tell him I fancy him, like. But if me dad finds out… He didn't want me to be a dancer, because he thought it was only for poofs, and now here we are.\" \"He did let you start dancing, though, so that's a start.\" Emily said. Zara seemed to sense the seriousness and put an arm around Billy's shoulders. \"And at least you know that Michael won't judge you. Plus you've got us.\" \"It's different back home, though. It's a mining town. Lads are supposed to do certain things, and lasses another. They already think it's weird that I'm a dancer, but being a poof? They'll think I'm mental. Michael says his mam's not being supportive, which admittedly won't be a problem for me, but what about the rest of me family? Dad and Tony'll think I'm a disappointment.\" The group arrived at a park bench, and although it wasn't their intended destination, Zara led the group to sit down. Billy sat in the middle, with Zara on his left and Emily on his right. They were quiet for a few minutes, and then Emily spoke. \"Billy, look at me.\" Billy wanted to keep looking at the water, studying every unique ripple, but forced himself to look up at his friend. \"No matter what anyone tells you, there is nothing wrong with being gay. And you can't be a disappointment to your family over something that you can't control. Whenever you talk about Michael, your face lights up.\" Billy gave a slight smile and looked away with embarrassment. \"Trust me, I've seen it. But anyone who thinks there is anything wrong with that can piss off, because they're wrong.\" \"Do you think I should tell my dad?\" \"If he has eyes he'll be able to see it, but tell him if you want.\" Zara said. \"Actually, I hate to say this,\" Emily started. \"But would it be safe for you to tell your dad? Because if he'd hurt you…\" \"I don't think he'd do that.\" Billy's voice was stronger than before. \"Would he still pay for you to come here?\" \"I'm… not sure.\" \"Okay, just, things to consider. Now, I hate to cut this short, but we need to get to the train station.\" As always, Emily made sure they were on time. The group started walking back. \"I vote we talk about something happier,\" Zara said. \"I wholeheartedly agree.\" Michael did end up changing clothes, but he told himself that it wasn't because his sister told him to. The dress was still in his room, and would not be returned. He used to be so careful, making sure to put borrowed clothing back every time for fear of getting caught, but if he had already been caught dressing up, it didn't seem like there was much point in hiding it. He escaped the house, although received many glares from Hannah while doing so. He told himself that he didn't care. What kind of sister was she anyway? Michael didn't realize until after a few minutes that he was absentmindedly walking to the gym, which doubled as a ballet studio. He was thinking about Billy, and had automatically connected the two. Michael wondered about what his sister had said. Could Billy have turned him gay? It didn't seem like it, as Billy was straight. Also, Michael had known he was gay for a long time, although he had known Billy a long time, too. Even if he had been turned gay, what was really so wrong with it? And what was wrong with Billy liking ballet? Sure, Michael had thought it was a little weird at first, but dancing made Billy happy. You couldn't really control what made you happy. Michael knew that kissing Billy had made him happy. Billy kissing him made him even happier. Michael was certain that those were feelings he couldn't control. The gym was empty. Michael turned on the light, but that seemed intimidating, so he turned it back were windows near the ceiling, and they lit up the large room just enough. Michael looked in the mirror. He remembered the one night that Billy started to teach him how to dance. Clad in a gorgeous tutu, having just kissed his best friend, and worried about being accepted, there were tons of emotions swirling around in his head. But they all disappeared when Billy started teaching. Maybe that was why Billy liked dancing so much. It was a way of escaping. A way of freeing yourself. Sure, it was a little nerve-wracking at first, but what wasn't? It was new and exciting, so different from the small mining town he was used to. It was his own little world. Just him and Billy. Billy's strong arms guiding his own as he formed the simple movements near perfection. The gym would hold those memories forever. It was the location where a magical night took place. A night that was strictly forbidden, because boys couldn't dance. Because boys couldn't kiss. Because boys couldn't wear tutus. Michael stood in front of the mirror, and began to dance. \"One last thing, Billy,\" Emily said. \"The train's almost here, can it be quick?\" Billy watched as the train came closer. Emily handed him a slip of paper. \"It has both mine and Zara's telephone numbers. I'm staying with Zara over break, so it's probably best to call her house first. But if you need anything , don't hesitate to call. Okay?\" \"Alright.\" He gave Emily a quick hug. \"Thank you,\" he whispered. He gave Zara a quick hug too, and then ran on to the train with his messenger bag. Only two more hours. Michael wasn't necessarily good at dancing, but it reminded him of Billy, so he continued to practice. He didn't dare join Mrs. Wilkinson's class for fear of his family finding out, but he did like to watch. Later, when he was alone, he would try his best to mimic the movements. First position, Billy had taught him. Feet at an angle; arms in a circle. Plie. Just simple motions, the stepping stones to something beautiful. He tried a pirouette, but it was way above his skill level. He fell several times before giving up. He needed a real teacher. Watching others dance didn't seem to be helping him learn. Billy would teach him. Michael glanced at the clock on the wall. Only an hour and a half. Billy had been trying to read books on dance technique for a while, but his thoughts became too distracting. What if his dad really did cut off the funding for his education? He'd probably never be able to see Nathan or Zara or Emily again. Not to mention that his dance career would be over. Without the proper training, it wouldn't matter how talented he was. Would it be worth it to tell his dad? No, he decided. It would be hard to lie, but he wanted to figure things out with Michael first. For the rest of the train ride, Billy read his books and thought about all that he would do when he was finally home. The train station was cold, but Michael knew that the uncomfortable wait would be worth it. His heart fluttered every time a new train arrived. He knew he was early, but each one that arrived could be Billy. Strangers passing by stared at him. Not many boys waited alone at the train station at a quarter to eight. But it was okay. They could wonder and judge all they wanted. Michael's best friend was coming home, and there was no way he was going to miss it. Another train came. Michael studied every face of the weary travelers scrambling out of the huge vehicle. Then he saw a familiar boy wearing a blue striped shirt. \"Aye, Billy!\" Billy turned when he heard his name. A familiar face was running up to him. Michael. Billy ran up to Michael, too, and they met in the middle, greeting each other with a hug. Each boy smiled, unsure of what to say. \"So, how's dance school been?\" Michael started, but he was interrupted when Billy's family found them. \"Billy!\" Tony greeted him, grabbing ahold of his brother's shoulders and giving them a friendly shake. \"How's your fancy poof school?\" \"It's not just for poofs, you know.\" Grandma butted in on the conversation. \"We tried renting out your room, but nobody wanted it.\" Her whole face lit up with the joke, and everyone laughed. Tony suggested that they go out for ice cream to celebrate Billy's arrival, which everyone agreed was a good idea. Billy hopefully asked if Michael could come, and his dad agreed. The group of five made their way to the nearest ice cream shop. They arrived, ordered and received their ice cream, and sat down at a table. Billy's family asked more about school, which he was happy to talk about. \"We have normal classes in the morning, and then dance in the afternoon, sometimes until late at night. I love it though.\" \"I still think it's fucking crazy,\" Tony said. Michael and Jackie looked at Tony. Michael, who had been silent since Billy's family had arrived, said, \"Have you ever actually seen Billy dance? He's bloody fantastic.\" Tony seemed taken aback by Michael's sudden words. \"Well, no, but dancing is still a right sissy thing to do.\" Billy grabbed Michael's hand under the table. Michael looked up at him in surprise, but neither boy said anything about it. \"It's not, really,\" Michael said. \"It's not like it's easy.\" \"And there are plenty of lads at my school who do it.\" Billy added. \"My friend Nathan's done it even longer than me.\" Tony still didn't seem convinced, but kept his mouth shut. Jackie tried to keep the peace by changing the subject, and asked his youngest son about his other friends. Billy told them all about Zara and Emily. \"So you're friends with lasses, too,\" Tony observed. \"Do you fancy any of them?\" \"Not particularly,\" Billy said. He hoped someone would change the subject. \"Are you sure?\" Billy's dad gave him a nudge. \"There must be at least one you think is cute.\" \"No, I'm really just there to learn. It's a school after all.\" Billy grasped Michael's hand a little tighter, their intertwined fingers hidden under the table. Grandma beamed. \"See, I have one studious grandson! Billy, right?\" \"Yes, grandma.\" They all finished their ice cream, and left the shop together. Michael let go of Billy's hand first, and the two boys shared a quick smile. Billy decided to walk Michael home, so the two groups went their separate ways. They walked in silence until they were sure that were out of earshot. \"What was that all about?\" Michael asked. The words made it sound like he was angry, but there wasn't even a trace of anger in his voice. Curiosity, yes, but no anger. \"I missed you.\" \"Oh. Well, I missed you, too, dancing boy.\" There was a moment's pause before Michael stretched out his hand. He looked at Billy, as though asking permission. Billy took the hand stretched out awkwardly in front of him. It was warm, just like before. It was new and different, but Billy knew it felt right. He was in love with Michael Caffrey. So, there you go! Another chapter down (YAY!). Please review and tell me what you thought of the multiple viewpoints. I've already started writing the third chapter, so that should be up soon. Thanks again! (Seriously, seeing that people like this makes my whole day.) -Ferocious Fangirl[Chapter 3] Hello again! Wow, it's been forever since I've written anything on here! I'm sorry if it seemed like I gave up on this story. Life is crazy, but I'll still definitely finish it. The ending is still a while away, though. Until then, enjoy chapter three! Although the town had remained similar to how Billy had left it, there were still many blatantly obvious differences. The next morning, Billy slept in. There was no need to get up early for boxing or ballet. Tony and Jackie, however, woke up with the sun for a full, tiring day of mining. The town had fallen back into the same familiar pattern as before the strike. Billy woke up to a cheerful voice. \"Oi, Billy! Why are you still asleep, like?\" With a slight panic, Billy threw open his eyes, only to see the smiling face of Michael Caffrey. \"Morning, Michael.\" He rolled over to lay on his stomach again, thinking that perhaps he could catch a few extra minutes of sleep. \"Afternoon, practically,\" Michael corrected. \"Yeah,\" Billy blindly agreed. \"What are you doing here, anyway?\" \"Just thought I'd come and visit. Didn't think you'd still be bloody sleeping.\" \"Oh.\" There was an awkward silence. \"I'm really happy you came back to visit.\" Michael said. \"Well, I didn't have much of a choice, but I'm happy, too.\" Realizing that Michael actually wanted conversation, Billy decided he could try to wake up. He pulled himself up in his bed and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, fighting desperately to keep his heavy eyelids open. Once again, he saw Michael's beautiful, happy face. You might as well get it over with now. Otherwise everything will be awkward for the rest of the time you're here. \"Hey, er, is anybody else home?\" \"Just your Grandma, why?\" Michael's tone was still bright. Billy hoped it would never change. \"Could you close the door?\" \"Sure, but why? Are you alright, Billy?\" Michael softly closed the door. \"I just… I need to tell you something.\" \"Well, go ahead.\" Michael sat down on the other side of Billy's bed, ready to listen. Always ready and eager to hear what Billy had to say. Billy took a deep breath. \"I… remember how I kissed you goodbye before I went off to school?\" Michael's cheeks turned pink. \"Aye, of course I remember.\" \"I've been thinking about it a lot, and the other one, too. After the Christmas party?\" \"I remember that, too.\" He spoke with hushed intensity. \"I want to do it again, but, real kissing perhaps? Not now, but, maybe… I don't know. I don't just want to be friends, Michael.\" \"So you do go to a fancy poof school.\" Michael flashed a sarcastic grin. \"It's not just for poofs.\" \"Okay.\" \"You won't tell anyone, will you?\" \"No, Billy.\" Michael gave his friend a kiss on the cheek. \"Do you want to go dance?\" \"Yeah.\" See, there was nothing to worry about. It's Michael. Billy tried to calm his nerves. If there was anyone who would understand, Michael was that person. The boys raced down the stairs, grabbed a piece of toast for Billy, said goodbye to Grandma, and began walking to the gym. Michael saw that Billy was nervous, and maybe a little scared, but he couldn't help but be happy. Billy fancies me. He's been thinking about the kiss, too. \"Let's go this way,\" he suggested, pointing towards small, beaten down dirt path. \"Why?\" \"It's less crowded,\" Michael replied, clutching Billy's hand. Suddenly, the events from the day before made sense. He wasn't just holding my hand out of pity. He actually likes me. Michael's thoughts were interrupted when Billy spoke. \"How did you know about this path? I've always gone the main way.\" \"I walk this way all the time.\" \"With Debby?\" \"Aye. Sometimes.\" Michael's voice began to fade. \"You're friends now, right? With Debby?\" Michael had become friends with Debby mostly out of necessity, but still agreed. \"Sort of.\" He wished Billy would stop prying for information about his social life. He wanted a day just between the two of them, and thinking about his lack of friends didn't necessarily scream 'happy Best Friend Finally Visiting From Fancy Dance School In London Day'. \"So you do have friends, then…\" Billy was oblivious to any hints drooped in Michael's voice. \"I don't know, Billy!\" His voice was harsh, but his heart sank directly afterward. Immediately, he was filled with regret. He was expecting more sharpness in return, but Billy's tone was soft. \"I'm sorry I left.\" Billy let go of Michael's hand. Oh no. He didn't want to hold hands. I've been taking it all too fast. He probably doesn't even really like me. But then, Michael felt a soft hand fall upon his shoulder, and paused for a moment. Billy noticed immediately. \"Is that too much? Sorry.\" He started to pull away, but Michael gently pushed it back. \"No, it's perfect,\" he replied, looking up at Billy. Then, to prove his point, he put his own arm around Billy's waist, so the two boys were locked together. \"And, about you leaving,\" He locked eyes with the boy tangled next to him. \"I know you had to go away to dance. I miss you, but… I get it now.\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" Billy gave a half-hearted smile, before Michael ended up tripping over his feet. Michael realized then that it was difficult to walk with another person so close. \"I've been working on learning some ballet,\" he said, as though it would make up for his clumsiness. \"I thought you said it was 'fucking weird'.\" Michael blushed when Billy mentioned his previous attitude towards dancing. \"But then… after the Christmas party…\" \"Aye. That was fun.\" The friends crossed the quiet road to go to a busier one, so they untangled themselves. It was awkward to have to let go so abruptly, but they was terrified of being caught. They silently agreed that it was worth the risk, though. Every second was precious. Billy understood why they had to let go, but it didn't feel right to just walk next to the other boy. He craved physical contact, even though that sometimes felt awkward, too. Everything was new, and although it was exciting, it took some getting used to. The boys walked into the gym together, only to find it completely empty. It seemed that the children in Everington were on break too. \"So you said you've been practicing?\" Billy asked Michael as they stood in the middle of the gym. \"Aye.\" Michael didn't move. \"Perhaps you could show me, then.\" Billy motioned his friend to the barre. \"Yeah,\" Michael replied. \"Right.\" Billy walked over to the barre with Michael, and saw his friend trembling as he got into first position. Part of him wanted to comfort the boy, whose stomach seemed to be bursting with butterflies, but another part of him said to stay quiet. He listened to the latter, because he thought his friend might need some silence to gather his thoughts. Then Michael was the one to break the quiet atmosphere. \"I'm not really all that good. I haven't taken classes or anything. Haven't even had a bloody teacher, like.\" \"You're fine, Michael. Just show me what you know.\" \"It's nothing. Look, I'm a fucking terrible dancer. I just like to pretend sometimes.\" Billy sighed. \"It doesn't matter if you're any good.\" The words brought back flashbacks of Mrs. Wilkinson saying similar things to him. \"Says the boy who got into The Royal Ballet School.\" \"Why do you like to dance?\" The exasperation was clear in Billy's question. \"It sounds stupid.\" \"Go on.\" Billy tried to stay polite, but he knew he was snapping at Michael. He loved Michael, but the boy was doing a fantastic job of wasting his time. \"I like to dance 'cause it reminds me of you. When you left I had nothing. No friends. No hobbies, really, except boxing. Not necessarily the best family. I'm not trying to complain, Billy. I know why you left, but I needed to keep a part of you with me. Dancing helped.\" Michael's eyes, which had started to linger on the floor, slowly turned their gaze to Billy. Until that moment, Billy had never thought much about his friendship with Michael. Sure, he'd had loads of daydreams about Michael when he was away, and they'd always been best friends, but he had never thought about Michael's view on their relationship. He was confident that Michael fancied him, but that was as far as it got. \"I really am sorry I left.\" Michael looked back down to the ground. \"No, like I said before. I get it now. It's still the only reason I started trying to do ballet, though. I'm not any good.\" \"Just show me what you've practiced. I know you don't have a teacher, but I can help.\" Billy saw Michael take a deep breath, and then watched as his friend began a well rehearsed routine. It wasn't nearly as good as what he was used to seeing at school, but he loved watching Michael try something new. No. What the hell are you thinking? Billy has seen some of the best dancers in the country, and you, the bloody idiot that you are, want to dance for him. Michael was horrified by the thought of messing up in front of Billy. You're taking an art form that means everything to him and destroying it. He's going to hate you. But he knew that his friend wanted to see him try, so he did. He tried to forget that Billy was there. He danced like he did when he was all alone. A form of art. A way of forgetting things. He finished with a series of lopsided chene turns, and landed in fourth position. He stayed there for a moment, just breathing. Then he dared to look at his friend. He was ready for judgement, but not looking forward to it. His heart skipped a beat when he saw Billy beaming. He was about to move, after all, he was finished, but Billy stopped him. \"No, stay there.\" Michael slid back to fourth position. As Billy walked over to his friend, his socks against the wooden floor were silent. Michael had danced without music, the dance itself being all that was needed. The only sound was the breathing of the two boys. \"Stand taller,\" Billy said, as he gently pushed Michael's shoulders back. \"Imagine you're a puppet hanging from strings on your head.\" Michael adjusted himself, and stood as tall as he could. He took Billy's advice with pride rather than shame, because he actually thought I did a good job! \"Aye, there you go.\" Billy moved around Michael, adjusting his friend's body as Mrs. Wilkinson had done for him in his early days of ballet. \"You know, you're actually sort of graceful when you try.\" \"You think so?\" Michael's face lit up in a brilliant smile. \"Of course, you idiot.\" Billy patted Michael on the back, almost in a brotherly way, breaking Michael away from his perfect fourth position. Overwhelmed with liberation, Michael engulfed Billy into a hug. \"I really did miss you. Life is a lot harder without your best mate by your side.\" He stayed there, not willing to let go, but also getting no resistance to the tight embrace. He breathed in the smell of his best friend, desperately wishing they could someday be something more. Billy spoke to Michael, his voice nothing more than a whisper. \"Right now, I don't want to go back.\" He gave Michael a quick squeeze and then carefully let go. They took a moment, just looking at each other, but Billy broke the silence. \"Do you want to keep dancing?\" Michael nodded, prompting a lesson similar to those led by Mrs. Wilkinson, although it had an absence of shouting. Once again, Billy walked Michael home. And once again, they took the back way so they could hold hands. They talked about the dancing for a while, both agreeing that the time they had together was fun. Billy couldn't wait to tell his friends back at school that he was starting to teach ballet. After a few silent minutes, a change in topic didn't seem strange, so Michael spoke up. \"Billy,\" he started. He paused, obviously unsure of what to say next. \"Aye,\" Billy replied, instantly concerned for his friend. Their day had been perfect, and he knew something was about to ruin it. \"Are you alright with all that we've been doing? I mean, most friends don't hold hands and stuff, especially lads.\" \"Michael, I seem to recall that I held your hand first.\" \"So, are we… boyfriends? Can two boys be dating each other? Are we dating each other?\" Billy had wondered about that on the whole train ride home. He'd even thought about it at school. He knew he fancied Michael, and he wanted to tell him. He just didn't know what that would mean. \"I've seen a couple of older lads dating at school, so I think it's alright. But, we're a little young, like.\" Billy glanced at his friend, hoping that Michael agreed with his thoughts. \"Aye… so it is lads who are together, and everyone's fine with it?\" Michael shot Billy a quizzical look. Billy returned the look as he talked to his friend. He'd thought that Michael would know more about boys dating each other than he did, but Everington was obviously still lacking in diversity. \"It's not common, but there are a few poofs at school. Some people don't like it, but most don't really care.\" \"I wish they didn't care here, either,\" Michael mumbled, his words sour. Avoiding eye contact, Billy spoke to his friend, his words starting out soft, but slowly forming a crescendo, until he was speaking at his usual volume. \"Michael, I don't care what they think. You shouldn't either. Someday, you'll move out. Someday we'll be boyfriends, and we'll live in London, and I'll be a professional dancer, and you'll be… whatever it is you want to be. And your family won't bother you, and you'll have a million friends. We just have to wait. It's going to get better.\" I thought that was a sweet ending. :) Please review and let me know what you thought! It really does mean a lot to me.

Open it! I wanna know what he said!\" Michael and Debbie had spent every day together since Billy left. Just talking. If they needed to escape from a drunk father or annoying mother, the other was usually there at the old wall, they were talking about the unopened letter from Billy that was crumpled in Michael's pocket. \"Alright, alright. I'll read it. Be patient Debbie.\" He fished the letter out from his pocket,filled with peppermints,cherry lolliepops from Debbie, and a set of house keys. He opened the letter and unfolded the parchment. \" 'Dear Michael, I miss you alot, tons really. I haven't made alot of friends here. Just one. Her name is Sirenelly Belle. I call her Siren. She's a pretty girl with flowing red hair and sparkling bright green eyes. She's a very nice girl. Like a mixture of you and Debbie. She's thirteen,and tiny,in height and weight. I have very good news Michael. I'm coming home for the full four months of summer break! I wrote to dad and Tony and Siren can come with me! Don't worry, she's very friendly. I told her everything I know about you and she's absolutely dying to meet you. She's looking forward to meeting everyone here. I miss you all. I'm going to be pulling into the station on June 8th at nine am. I hope I see you there. Love, Billy XOXO'\" Michael nearly fell off the wall he and Debbie were sitting on. Debbie choked on her cherrylolliepop,Michael had to pat her on the back. Billy was coming home! They hopped off the wall, hugged their goodbyes, and ran off to tell their mother's. said Debbie could go as long as was o.k. with it and she brought Billy around. Debbie promised and ran off to speak to the Elliot's. On the way,Michael ran into her-literally. \"Ow! Michael!\" \"Sorry Debbie.\" they got up and ran to the Elliot's. Very soon had said they could come and they would just wait until it was time to go in thirteen days. They really couldn't wait.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two... Debbie was waiting when Michael ran up,pulling his jean jacket over a blue T-shirt. She pulled him along to the bus station, checking the gold pocket watch her father got her for her birthday every five minutes. Debbie had recently turned thirteen. She had on a red shirt that fit her form snuggly,and jeans with black ballet flats. She had painted her nails blue(Billy's favorite color) and was wearing the little black Scottie dog pin he had sent her. She had on a bit of pink lipgloss and peach eyeshadow. When they finally reached the bus station they quickly found Tony and Billy's Dad(Debbie never could quite remember his name) and stood with them. The bus soon pulled in. People started pouring out of it. There were only six or seven people still on it now. A girl walked out onto the platform. Debbie stared despite herself at her. The girl was the prettiest girl Debbie had ever seen. A real life Odette. The girl's glossy red hair was swept up in a flawless bun and secured with a jeweled pin. Surely, this wasn't the girl Billy had met... Billy came off the bus. \"BILLY!\" Debbie and Michael called. He looked over. \"DEBBIE! MICHAEL!\" He cried,running over and huggning his tw best friends. The girl smiled a glossy red lipped smile and walked over. Debbie saw the silver nail polish glint with rhinestones. \"Im Sirenelly. But call me Siren.\" She said with a small shake of he hand as Debbie and Michael took her hand in turn. Billy's dad and Tony came over. \"Dad! Tony! Oh, I missed you!\" Billy said, hugging his father and older brother. \"This is Siren.\" He said. \"Wel Siren, welcome to our humble town. We hope you'll like it.\" \"It's alot different from the upper class of London. I like it already.\" She said cheerfully. Debbie smiled. \"We hope you do. I'm Debbie by the way. Debbie Wilkinson. And this is Michael Cafferey.\" She said, pointing to the boy next to her. \"Hi.\" Michael said quietly, it was obvious he thought Sirenelly was very pretty. \"Hello.\" Siren walked over to the luggage pile, took to brown travellers and walked over. \"So...Shall we go?\" ","Summary":" \"Come on Michael.

Die Temperatur lag fünfzehn Grad unter Null und der Wind der durch die Gassen pfiff, machte es noch kälter. Zumindest kam es einem so vor. Peter zog seinen dünnen Mantel enger um sich, versuchte auf den Beinen zu bleiben, als er auf einer glatten Stelle ins rutschen kam. Die Menschen, die ihm entgegen kamen, beachteten ihn nicht. Jeder war mit sich selbst beschäftigt. Auf der suche nach Nahrungsmitteln und nach Brennholz. Oder wenigstens nach etwas, was man verbrennen konnte. Seine Heimatstadt, Hamburg, lag in Trümmern. Nicht viel war mehr von ihr übrig. Häuser lagen in Schutt und Asche. Gespenstig sah alles aus und ein Schauer lief über Peters Rücken. Er hatte auf seinen Weg hierher viele Orte gesehen, aber keines war so schrecklich wie das hier. Seine eigene Stadt, sein Zu Hause, so zu sehen, tat ihm im Herzen weh. Getrieben um die Sorge um seiner Mutter und seines Bruders stolperte er vorwärts. Sein Blick fiel auf eine verkohlte Leiche am Straßenrand. Wie es schien, hatte keiner die Zeit, oder Lust, gehabt, sie weg zu schaffen. Peter wollte sich nicht ausmalen, noch vorstellen, wie viele Menschen noch unter den Trümmern lagen. Er hoffte, dass es seiner Familie gut ging. Das sie den Angriff und den Krieg überlebt hatten. Hamburg sah gespenstig aus. Kein schöner Ort, um zurück zu kehren. Keine schöne Zeit. Obwohl… Peter lachte humorlos auf. Was für ein Tag, um wieder heim zu kommen. Weihnachtliche Stimmung war hier nichts zu sehen. Noch spürte man Herzenswärme. Jeder war sich selbst der Nächste. Geschrei und Gefluche drang an sein Ohr und als er um eine Häuserecke bog sah er die Ursache. Eine kleine Menschenmenge hatte sich um etwas gescharrt. Schmerzenschreie ertönten und wildes Geschimpfe. Es fielen keine netten Worte. Peter wusste, was da vor sich ging und er beeilte sich, um von diesem Tumult weg zu kommen. Die hungernden Menschen schlugen sich aller Wahrscheinlichkeit um Lebensmittel. Nur noch wenige Meter trennten ihn von seinem Haus. Er hielt unwillkürlich die Luft an, beschleunigte seinen Schritt, soweit es seine geschundenen Füße es zuließen. Die Schuhe die er trug, waren durchlöchert und die Sohle hing auf halb Acht. Die letzte Ecke und er schluchzte auf. Wie durch ein Wunder war sein Elternhaus ganz geblieben. Er konnte es einfach nicht glauben. Peter stolperte vorwärts, überquerte die Straße und betrat das Haus. Es war dunkel im Hausflur, aber das störte ihn nicht. Er kannte den Weg nach oben. Sein Herzschlag beschleunigte sich, als er die letzten Stufen der Treppe hinter sich brachte. Was ist, wenn jetzt fremde Leute dort wohnten, wo sie früher gewohnt hatten? Was wäre, wenn seine Mutter und sein kleiner Bruder doch tot waren? Peter wollte daran nicht denken. Er wollte hoffen. Noch immer war das Namensschild an der Tür. Mit zitternder Hand, drückte er auf den Klingelknopf. Er fühlte sich hundeelend. Hundeelend, weil er die letzten Monate unterwegs war. Hundeelend, weil er nichts gegessen hatte, seit gut vier Tagen. Da war ein kratzendes Geräusch hinter der Tür zu hören, und dann wurde sie leicht geöffnet. \"Hallo Mami.\" Der Gesichtsausdruck von der Frau wechselte von Überraschung zu Unglaube und dann zur Wut. Sie holte aus und schlug Peter. Dieser biss die zähne zusammen. Die Reaktion seiner Mutter war verständlich. Sekunden später schluchzte sie auf und Tränen rannen ihr über die Wangen. Sie zog ihn in ihre Arme. \"Mein Junge. Mein Peter.\" Sie strich ihm über den Rücken, küsste dann ihren Sohn und zog ihn in die Wohnung. \"Mein Junge…\" Immer wieder wiederholte sie diese beiden Worte, weinte und lachte gleichzeitig. Sie konnte es nicht glauben, dass er wieder da war. \"Willi!\", rief sie und kurz darauf kam Peters Bruder. Sie starrten sich an und dann lagen auch sie sich in den Armen. Plötzlich brachen alle Dämme bei Peter. Er war so glücklich, dass sie alle lebten. \"Komm setzt dich hin\", sagte sie, schob ihren großen Sohn zur Couch. Er nahm Platz, wischte sich die Tränen weg und schluckte hart. \"Mama…Ich…Es tut mir leid…\", brachte er hervor und schluchzte auf. Er schlug seine Hände vor das Gesicht. Peters Mutter schlang ihre Arme um ihn, hielt ihren Jungen fest. Auch Willi weinte. Er setzte sich neben seinen Bruder, legte auch seine Arme um ihn. Sie waren wieder vereint. Sie waren wieder eine Familie. \"Das ist das schönste Weihnachtsgeschenk, dass du mir machen konntest\", flüsterte sie. ","Summary":" Peter Müllers Rückkehr Es war kalt an diesem Dezembertag.

You can all thank her, and her verbal expressions of said crush, for this one. (Also, she's just really cool.) Disclaimer: Sadly, I do not own Swing Kids, nor do I own Thomas and Peter - I just like to borrow them once in a while and have a little fun. ;-) The title was inspired by the Jamie Foxx song, \"Blame It (On The Alcohol).\" Just Blame It On the Alcohol \"You know, you're eyes are really pretty.\" Peter chokes on his mouthful of whiskey. \"W-what?\" he splutters, wiping the corner of his mouth on his sleeve. Thomas doesn't respond right away, but gently pries the half-empty bottle from Peter's fingers and takes another swig. \"They're brown,\" he finally answers, his voice matter-of-fact and more than a little slurred. \"I like brown eyes.\" Thomas's own eyes are dazed and unfocused, and Peter hastily reminds himself not to take anything he says too seriously. Thomas has been known to say some incredibly stupid things when he's bent. Even more stupid than usual. \"Um. Okay. …Thanks, I guess.\" Thomas flashes him this little, crooked grin before letting his eyes fall shut. The two boys sit together in silence for a while, side-by-side on the cold, hardwood floor next to Peter's bed. And then Thomas mumbles, \"So's the rest of you.\" \"Huh?\" Thomas has been perfectly quiet and totally still for so long that Peter was honestly starting to think he'd fallen asleep. \"Quiet\" and \"still\" aren't exactly at the top of the list of Thomas's specialties. But when Peter turns his head, he finds Thomas very much awake and staring straight at him in a way that makes the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. He shifts uncomfortably. \"What…what did you—?\" \"The rest of you is really pretty, too,\" Thomas says with more clarity. He scoots closer to Peter so that their thighs are pressed together, and Peter tries not to feel the sudden rise in his pulse. \"Like your hair.\" He reaches over, slowly, and then awkwardly drags a hand through Peter's overgrown locks. \"And your face.\" His hand falls, and then fingertips brush over high cheekbone and down to strong jawline, and all Peter can do is just sit there, frozen. \"And…and this little spot right here.\" Thomas trails his hand downwards one last time, coming to rest just over Peter's collarbone. Thomas must be really drunk. Really, really, really drunk. Too drunk to even realize what he's saying or doing, obviously. Then again, he didn't really have any more to drink than Peter did, and Peter is at least still in his right mind (probably), but Thomas has always been more of a lightweight than he's willing to admit. He's not going to remember any of this tomorrow morning. He's going to wake up, probably still on the floor, and have no recollection of any of this whatsoever, and he'll start bitching about the inevitable headache he'll have and then Peter will have to take care of him, as usual, and Peter will try to pretend that it never happened, like he has no memory of it either, and— And then Thomas is leaning in, and he's pushing Peter's unbuttoned shirt collar aside, and he's pressing his mouth to the little bit of exposed skin right where his fingers had been, and Peter's breath hitches in his throat and he stops thinking entirely. Finally, though, he comes back to his senses and shoves Thomas away. \"What the hell—?\" Peter glances down at the glass bottle still clutched in Thomas's left hand and makes a mental note to never, ever let Thomas talk him into getting plastered together again. \"Okay, you know what? I think you've had enough of this for now.\" He reaches down to pull it away, but then Thomas is making a grab for his hand and he's lacing their fingers together and he's holding on so tightly that Peter can't let go. Peter doesn't want to let go. Peter locks gazes with Thomas again, and there's something in his hazel eyes that hasn't been there before—or maybe it's always been there, and Peter just hasn't noticed it before. It's something that's open and honest and scary and it makes Peter want to look away; he wants so desperately to just look away and try to pretend that nothing ever happened and try to force himself to forget. But then Thomas's lips are ghosting over his in the barest, faintest trace of a kiss and fuck, Peter decides, to hell with it all. \"Wait,\" he breathes, pulling back for only a moment to grab the bottle and down the rest of the liquor. And then he's grasping Thomas by the shoulders and he's kissing him, finally, really kissing him, just the way Peter's been trying not to imagine, and it's something else entirely, something that's hard and hot and awkward and sloppy and perfect. And Peter, for once, just lets himself feel, and doesn't worry or think too much or try to hold himself back or make excuses. He doesn't need to. He's drunk now, after all. Really, really, really drunk—too drunk to even realize what he's saying or doing, obviously. And besides. He's not going to remember any of this tomorrow morning.

Enjoy! The year was 1955. World War II ended ten years ago but the effects of that horrid time period still ravaged the world, especially the now-disgraced Germany. Countless of lives had been lost and many families had been torn apart and destroyed. Members of the Nazi Party were still being sought out and tried for the crimes they had committed. Thomas Berger was not one of them. The former Swing Kid and reformed ex-member of the Hitlerjugend had successfully escaped the vicious clutches of the mad-man Adolf Hitler on the same night he had betrayed his friend and the love of his life. In the confusion of rounding up the 'criminals' at Bismarck, Thomas slipped away into the night and hid in the shadows, listening intently for any sign that he had been caught. After several long and worrisome hours, he still had not been discovered. Relieved, he allowed all the pent-up rage and frustration to flood his body and his senses. He tore off his uniform and sobbed at the horrors he had done. He had betrayed his family, his friends, his country, himself, and his love. From that moment on, Thomas Berger was no more. He made a new identity for himself and he swore that he would make up for the things he had done. He would seek redemption, even if it killed him, and he would find out what happened to Peter Müller after he had been taken away to the war camps. For years Thomas wandered around Germany and fought against the Nazis. He had met many people along the way and been to many places but he had not heard anything about Peter. When the war ended, he had gone to Buchenwald, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and many other concentrations camps looking for Peter but to no avail. He wasn't there. Devastated and trying not to give up hope, Thomas kept searching. Peter could not be dead. Peter just could not die. No. No. Nonono. NO! He refused to believe that Peter had died. Peter Müller was strong, even as a youth. He was a survivor and Thomas refused to believe otherwise. But ten years had gone by and there was still no sign of his boyhood companion and his teenage love. It was time to admit to himself that he had sentenced Peter to death that night at the Bismarck. He could have loved him and he could have been with him all these years had he only made the right decision. Instead, Thomas became the Judas to Peter's Jesus. He had sold Peter out for power and he had paid the ultimate price. Sighing wearily and holding back a fresh wave of tears that threatened to spill down his face, Thomas walked down the gloomy streets of Hamburg that still reeked of despair and devastation. He avoided making eye contact with anyone. He didn't fear that anyone would recognize him. He just didn't want to see Peter behind every smile and passing glance. He just wanted to visit the decrepit building that once was the Bismarck. That beautiful place was now just a memory of his sad past. Every once in a while he would go there, always at night, and remember all the good and bad times. He did not subscribe to the church or religious beliefs but whenever he was at the Bismarck, he would pray for Peter. The street was mostly empty now which suited the solemn man. Lost in his thoughts now, he rounded the corner and found himself staring at his old sanctuary. He didn't notice the person standing beside him. They both just stared at the broken down edifice. Thomas didn't become aware of his surroundings until he heard the person beside him humming a familiar tune. He tilted his head to the side and listened carefully, identifying the song to be Bei Mir Bist Du Schön . He hadn't heard that song in years. Not since that night… The hair on the back of his neck prickled and he slowly turned his head to look at his companion. Butterflies fluttered in the pit of his stomach and his heart momentarily stopped beating. The man beside him felt Thomas's stare and he also turned to look at him, smiling lightly. Peter. Peter Müller. Peter Müller was standing beside him. He was definitely older and he had the aura of someone who had stared straight into the depths Hell and survived. Ever after all these and years and who-knows-how-many horrors he had faced, Peter was still beautiful. Thomas turned fully towards Peter and took a step back, gasping and holding onto his chest, afraid that his heart would burst out. \"Hello, Thomas.\" Blood pounded in Thomas's ears and his mouth dropped. \"P-Peter…\" Both men stood there, staring at each other and eyeing all the changes that the years had bestowed on them. \"H-how…? What…? I-…\" Thomas swallowed thickly, unable to get his words out. Peter shook his head and smiled sadly. He held out his arms as an invitation, which Thomas gladly took. The moment that Peter's arms encircled his neck, years and years of emotions rose to the surface and he finally broke. Thomas clutched onto Peter for dear life, sobbing into the collar of his Peter's coat and repeating over and over how sorry he was. Peter rubbed his back in soothing circles and allowed his friend to release the demons that haunted him. They remained in their embrace for several long minutes. Neither cared if anyone witnessed their moment and no one did. Moonlight illuminated the empty streets and the stars twinkled in delight over their reunion. The men reluctantly separated but didn't let go on each other in case one of them disappeared. Tears continued to roll down Thomas's cheeks and Peter lightly brushed them away with his thumb. His finger inadvertently caressed Thomas's lips, causing the man's breath to hitch in his chest. Both froze and looked deep into each other's eyes, trying to read and interpret the similar emotion they found there. Their heads moved slowly towards each other. Both seemed scared and apprehensive of each other and they stopped a breath's width away. Time froze and waited for someone to take the first step. Thomas's heart pounded in his chest and his eyes fluttered shut as Peter's lips gently touched his in a butterfly kiss. Breaking for the second time that day, he wrapped his arms around Peter's neck and deepened the kiss, pouring all his love and longing and sorrow. Thomas felt Peter's arms wraps around his waist and pull him closer. He couldn't believe that this moment had finally come. After all the years and all the searching, he fantasized about the moment he would find his liebling*, but he never believed the day would actually come. The ever-watchful moon that had once witnessed their separation now witnessed their unification. The men broke the kiss. Their foreheads rested against each other as they stared into one another's eyes, gasping for breath. Neither said anything because nothing needed to be said. With every breath they took, the past drifted away from them and now they could both look towards the future; a future they would spend together and no force in this world or otherwise would change that. From a nearby window, a beautiful but sad voice surrounded the couple. Goodnight, my love…the tired, old moon is descending. The music washed over them; stilling their racing hearts and bringing them closer together. Goodnight, my love. My moment with you now is ending. \"No,\" Peter whispered, breaking the enchantment of the moment. Thomas's heart filled with dread at what that word might entail. \"It's not 'Goodnight, My Love' anymore. It shall now be, 'Hello, My Love'.\" Peter smiled lovingly at him, causing Thomas's soul to soar up into the heavens. \"Yes,\" Thomas agreed. His voice was thick with emotion. \"Hello, my love…\" Entwining their hands together, they turned away from the Bismarck and walked softly into the night, together at last. Liebling: sweetheart, love, darling.

Thomas Berger walked into he and Peter's swing club of choice that night, ready to find a pretty girl and dance the night away before returning to HJ in the morning. He caught the eye of the singer of the club, a young woman around his own age with striking blue eyes and a fire-red dress. \"It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing,\" she sang. It was the anthem of the swing kids. Thomas found a table and sat down to wait for Peter and Evey to arrive. He kept his eyes on the singer. They made eye contact and she winked at him before she turned to the rest of the dancers on the floor to finish the song. When the song and applause ended, she thanked the audience and walked off the stage. She walked to the table Thomas was sitting at. \"What's a fine HJ boy like yourself doing here?\" she asked, a casual smile on her face, not wanting to attract the attention of anyone else in the club. Thomas stuttered as he tried to think of a reply. \"I saw you the other day in a uniform. So what makes you think you can keep up the two lives?\" She lit a cigarette as she sat down at the table. \"I knew I was going to be forced to join at some point. It's just safer this way,\" he replied. \"And it hasn't been too hard.\" \"So you get the protection of being an HJ, but the fun of being a swing kid?\" she asked. \"Yep,\" he replied. \"It's been going great so far.\" \"Just wait,\" she said. \"Eventually, you're going to have to choose. Swing kid, or Nazi. You can't have both. One day, your fun will end.\" \"You say that like I've already chosen,\" Thomas said. \"A real swing kid would have asked any stray pigeon here to dance,\" she began, taking a drag. \"You, however, went right to sit down.\" \"I'm not a Nazi,\" he replied, his voice low. \"I'm a swing kid.\" \"Maybe for now,\" she said, moving closer to him to speak quieter. \"But it's not who you are when no one's looking, but who you are when everyone is. Who you are during the day. So it don't mean a thing what you do when you're not in that uniform. You still go back to it every day and that makes you just like them.\" \"I'm not like them,\" he snapped at her, causing her to back away. \"I'm not a Nazi.\" \"What you say won't matter if you keep leading the double life,\" she said. He stared at her in disbelief as she stood. \"Well, enjoy the rest of your night.\" She sauntered off to the stage to talk to the band members and prepare for her next song, leaving Thomas alone. \"I'm not a Nazi,\" he said to himself. \"I'm a swing kid. Not a Nazi.\" He continued to repeat those words in his head until Peter and Evey arrived. Only then did he ask a girl to dance. When they were on the floor, the singer caught his eye again. Her eyes repeated her words for her. \"It don't mean a thing...\" So it might not be very good. I thought this idea up a while ago and wrote it and just now decided to publish it. Reviews are lovely.

I cry at movies, but never like this. Part of it could benthat swing music does have a special meaning for me…part of it wasnjust that it was..wow. Anyway, I wasn't planning on writingnanything about this, but there was something screaming at me to writenit. I couldn't help it, I had to. I had to address why Thomas isna bastard, psychologically, his own reasons…etc. I hope this..sortnof does that. I'm not entirely satisfied, but on the same note, Indidn't want this to become a huge ongoing project because I havenenough of those already. So it might be a little rushed. Also, thenlanguage is not late 30s/early 40s accurate, I know that, it doesn'tnfeel on the level to me, but…for my purposes here…that's ok. nHope you like it regardless. Rebel He closed the book onnhis desk with a thick thud. Thomas Berger felt that at any momentnhis brain would explode from all of the information he had tried toncram in it tonight. There was so much more to learn, but Thomasncouldn't bare anymore. It wasn't even that he was learning, justnmemorizing words to recite them on a test. Absently, Thomas tracednthe letters on the cover of the hard-bound text book. His bestnfriend Peter was, like Thomas, studying to be an engineer. Germanynneeded good engineers, especially now. But he wasn't the scholar –nPeter was. No matter how hard Thomas tried, it was never enough. He couldn't learnnthis, he wasn't smart enough. All of his friends had high enoughnintelligence levels that had gotten them to where they were, but fornThomas it was only that his family had money. And his father'snwishes. Pushing the book away,nhe stood up and brushed back his long hair with one hand, grabbingnhis coat with the other. By now Peter, Arvid and Otto were probablynon their way to the Bismark, already finished their work…gonenhappily to dance and have fun without incident. Peter's mothernwasn't concerned with his love of swing, Arvid lived by himself,nand the same with Otto… The four of themnstarted like this, with swing. It was new, it was different, andnthat in itself was thrilling. But when it became illegal, the thrillnwas at its peak for Thomas. He loved that feeling, of doingnsomething he wasn't supposed to and not caring about it. Screwnauthority. He grinned slightly as he headed downstairs, but the grinnfaded and he paused. His father's mufflednvoice stopped from the next room and the man stormed into the hall. nSlowly Thomas walked down the stairs, watching him warily. Dr.nBerger looked up from his angry pacing at his son, and glared, \"Wherenare you going?\" \"Out, Papa…\"nThomas sighed. \"To that swing club?\" The boy noddednslightly. The doctor pointed anfinger at him in emphasis, \"You waste your time with thesenpointless…dances, when you could be doing more important things! nThat is what is wrong with society. What's wrong with you!\" Thomas clenched hisnfists at his sides, \"I'm not..wasting my time…\" \"No?\" Bergernquestioned incredulously, \"Not wasting your time? That is exactly what you are doing, boy! I saw your marks from school, you shame mynfamily! I will not have my son taking part in these..swing clubsnanymore, they will rot your brain and make you even more of andisappointment than you already are!\" Despite all that henthought instead, and the hatred he held for his father, the wordsnstill stung Thomas. He lowered his eyes slightly for a moment, thennlooked up at the man before he turned for the door. \"Don't walk awaynfrom me!\" Berger bellowed angrily, and grabbed Thomas' shoulder,nspinning him back around. \"I told you no more swing!\" The boy swallowed hard,nseething. He glared up at his father, \"If I'm such andisappointment, then why does it matter? I'll go anyway, you can'tnstop me, no matter how hard you try!\" Narrowing his eyes,nBerger raised his hand, and hit Thomas once, then stared at him againnin disgust and hit him again. \"You will always be a misfit.\" He kept his head downnas he brought up a hand to wipe the small drop of blood from thencorner of his mouth. Slowly, Thomas glanced up again. In thendoorway to the other room, his mother stood, watching helplessly. Henlooked up at his father again defiantly, then turned again and walkedntowards the door. \"I shouldn't letnyou in this house anymore, someday I won't, Thomas! Then wherenwill you go, not with one of your poor friends! They would neverntake you in!\" Berger shouted after him. Thomas slammed thendoor. On the porch, he sighed heavily and looked up at the dark sky.n Almost every time he left, there was some sort of confrontation. Itnwas a normal thing. Thomas thought that at some point he would benused to it. But he wasn't. He had the strongest urge to hitnsomething… As he walked, his handsnshoved deep into his pockets, staring at his feet, he suddenlyncollided with another boy who was also not paying attention comingnaround a corner. Thomas dusted himself off, and smoothed out hisnsuit as he stood up, glaring at the other boy, \"Why don't younwatch where you're going, are you blind or something?\" \"I was watching!\"nthe other boy protested as he stood up too, \"You ran into me!\" Thomas shoved him hard,n\"You want to make something over it?\" Now more provoked, thenother boy narrowed his eyes and shoved back. \"Bastard,\" he spatnat him. There was no pausenbetween the second shove – no need to think. Thomas swung hisnfist, punching the boy square in the jaw. The other boy quicklynretaliated, but Thomas gained the upper hand, shoving the boy againstnthe wall again. About to hit him again, he stopped and backed down anlittle. \"Get out of here..\" he said, panting a little. The boy stared at himnfor a moment before running off. Thomas sighed, brushing his hairnback with one hand. He didn't feel wrong in punching the boy atnall, he was in no mood to take anything from anybody, and people knewnthat about him. To some people, ThomasnBerger was intimidating, but to others like his friends, he stillnheld his own power. Because that's what it really was allnabout…power. He wouldn't tolerate a challenge. And that power –nit felt good. It felt right. He continued down thenstreets until he came to the familiar bridge by the docks. Peter,nArvid and Otto were already waiting. Thomas grinned at them as henapproached, \"Hey, are we going to stand around by the docks allnnight or are we going to go dancing, huh?\" \"Dancing..\" Peternanswered and looked at his friend with concern, \"What happened tonyour face?\" Shrugging, Thomasnlooked between all of them, \"Got into a fight..nothing important.\" \"Yeah…good…younbetter stop fighting before you get picked up by the pounders fornit…\" Arvid sighed, picking up his guitar case, \"Or at leastndon't let them come after the rest of us.\" \"I'd fight themntoo!\" Thomas replied with another grin, balling his fists andnpretending to box at Peter, who only shook his head and threw a fewnfake punches. He laughed and rustled Peter's hair, getting swattednat in the process, as they started walking across the bridge. It wasnall a front really, Thomas thought…but they'd never know what wasnbehind his mischievous grin and frequent fights. That was power. ","Summary":" Ok, well…I first sawnthis a few days ago.

If I did, it would have had a happy ending with Peter and Thomas riding off into the sunset…or into Bismarck together. As Peter turned to look at me while climbing aboard the truck that would send him to a work camp, I felt a pang of regret and I felt my heart break. I knew I would never see him again and at that moment I regretted everything I had done. How could I have betrayed him? How could I have chosen to be something I hate? It was supposed be a simple and fun game. HJ by day and Swing Kid by night. Instead, I lost myself to filth, hate, and lies. Hate and propaganda had replaced the music I love and the friends I had. And because of that, I've lost the one person that means the most to me. My best friend…my fellow Swing Kid…my secret love…Peter. He was the one that made swinging so amazing. He was the beat to my music. He was the one person I could depend on. When we tried to steal that radio, he went along with it despite the possible, and unfortunately inevitable, consequences of that action. He was the one person who made each and every day brighter even though there were troubled times in Germany. He was my world. I love him. That smirk he sent my way destroyed everything I believed in. He made me realize what an idiot I was for swallowing all the lies that the HJ fed us and now I realize that I've given up the person I once was to become a demon. The worst part about it is that I gave up on Peter. I gave up on the love of my life. I can't put to words the way I feel towards him. Anytime I was around him, my blood ran hot and my heart beat wildly in my chest. I had to pretend to be nonchalant and hide my jealousy when he was dancing with someone else instead of with me. Every time we would walk home after a night at the Bismarck, I would have to resist from pressing him up against a wall and kissing him. It's ironic that the time I get to be pressed up against him is when I'm beating him with fists and with a baton. Looking at him, sitting on that truck with blood running down his face, I regret not acting upon my feelings. Now I will never have a chance to tell him how I feel. I will never have another chance to even look at him again. If I could turn back time, I would smack my past self and tell myself not to steal the radio. I would tell myself to act upon my feelings before it's too late. I would tell myself so many things and do so many things to change the future. If only. If only. I bit back an angry and tormented scream for my lost love and for being this thing I am now. I could not tell Peter every little thing in that small precious time we had before the truck pulled away. The only thing I could say as an apology, as a confession, as a sign of defeat was \"Swing Heil\". I'm sorry, Peter. I'm sorry. I hope that deep down inside you know that. I hope that one day you can find it in yourself to forgive me. Now, we must go our separate ways. I will continue to be an HJ kid because there is no breaking out of that. I must live and suffer knowing my betrayal of you and of everything I believed in. And you, dear friend, will suffer but you will be free knowing you did the right thing. You stayed true to yourself, which is more than you'll ever need. Goodbye, Peter. I will always think of you and you will always be in my heart. Goodnight, my love.

(If I did, Christian and Robert would be a couple.) A/N: I'm sorry for any errors. My mind was blank. I didn't have much time to dwell on it; soon my mind was rushed by loud bangs and senseless shoving. It was becoming a hopeless cause to resist their attacks, and I have become an emotionless being. I can see him from across my camp. How he was transferred to be the guard here was pure fate, (or perhaps sheer dumb luck?). He avoids me, but I know he's watching my every move. He waits until I am so weak that I could collapse under the weight of a feather to look at me. I look into his eyes knowingly, his silent voice apologizing. I still love him. Thomas never smiles, I've noticed it more than ever. When former HJ students I have known laugh at our misery, he doesn't respond. He can feel it: that pain in his heart. It almost lifts my spirit, in a way, to think of it that way. Maybe his mind is rushing as much as mine... I think about our nights from years past... Does he think about them as well?... I'm certain he does... He is moved to guard our area of the camp. I can tell he is looking at me, and only me. I feel a strain on my heart when he yells at me, telling me to pick up the pace. Why are we marching in place? I don't even remember the cause they gave us. He smirked. Damn that smirk I know so well. I oblige however, and lift my feat higher and at a faster pace. I'll show him; all of them. I WILL make it out of this hell alive. It's finally over; the darkness of night has fallen and all the prisoners return to their quarters. Except me. We're staring straight at each other and I can feel almost an unnerving feeling wash over me. \"I want a moment with him. I want to break him,\" Thomas's voice... I missed it. It's now commanding, in charge of what's around him. I have to hold back a chuckle at the insanity of it. The other guards nod, quite pleased with his decision, and return to their own destinations. I watch them go, letting my shoulders droop a tad. \"You really--really--shouldn't push me like that,\" I smile weakly, it represents how I feel. \"Really?\" He questions me, his tone neutral now, \"Follow me.\" I do as he asks, humming a silent jazz tune as we walk. Between two rather large buildings, there is an almost alley-like space: dark and used for storage of sorts. He leads me down it, all the way to the end, where the surrounding brick wall stops the alley abruptly. He places a hand on my tattered clothing and grips it, pulling me close. His lips touch mine briefly, a soft smack of suction following. He smiles and presses me against the wall, running a hand through my mangled hair. I let my eyes close, almost sure of what's to come--he surprises me by pulling away. I grunt in disappointment. \"Relax,\" he whispers. Thomas's back is turned towards me as he reaches for a wooden box and lifts its lid. Inside I can see potatoes and bread, and my mouth begins to water. He pulls them both out, looking up at me. I know he can see the ravenous look in my eyes. He tosses me two potatoes and a small loaf of bread. Immediately I begin to tear into them, my stomach aching for all it can devour. His shoulder presses into mine gently as he stands with me against the wall. I slide down, tired and sore--mentally and physically; he follows and I lay my head on his shoulder. Munching on the potato, although not my favorite food, I almost want to cry out, break down before him, and have him hold me. But his presence is enough to keep me sane, even if it's for only one more night. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Swing Kids. (If I did, Christian and Robert would be a couple.)

When did it all go so wrong? How did I become the person I hate? There was a time I could look at myself in the mirror, but now? I can't. Peter's gone and somehow I feel to blame. Thomas Berger looked up for a moment to stare out the window, half thankful it was raining and dreary. He wasn't sure he could handle a lovely day. His soul felt empty and he looked once again at the pages of his journal. He started keeping one after that night…the night he wanted to take back…to forget, but he couldn't. Every now and again, he'd see Willie and, despite his attempts to take care of the young man, Willie despised Thomas, blaming him for Peter's arrest. Not that Thomas blamed Willie. He too blamed himself. If he had just not fought with his best friend…if he had just helped him sneak out. If he had only done anything but what he did. I don't know when I became so involved with the HJ. It started when we hoisted that radio. The one belonging to that Jewish man down the street. Peter had to join the HJ. I felt that it was my obligation to join my best friend. After all, why should he have to go through all that alone? When did it become my life? When did I become that person? When did I, as Peter said, believed that propaganda? When did I begin to idolize Emile and forget about my friendship with Peter? With Arvid? When…I ask myself when? I wonder how Peter was able to separate himself from the HJ, despite being in it? How was he able to maintain his beliefs and not believe everything that Hitler has told us? Peter was amazing that way. I just hope he makes it out of the work camp alive, but if he does, he'll never be the same. But, only in body. Or at least one hopes. If he does make it out alive and I have the chance…I am going to do everything I can to make him…to make Willie…realize how much pain I have felt and continue to feel over this. I betrayed my best friend. Even as Peter danced as he was being arrested, I fought with myself to do something. He looked at me and all I could do was yell 'Swing heil!' as he stepped on the truck. I saw Willie running, screaming, after Peter. When Peter yelled back 'Swing heil, Willie! SWING HEIL!', I knew that Peter would remain unbroken and that the Nazis would be facing trouble as Willie, a young boy of 10, yelled 'Swing heil!' back. He kept yelling and yelling. And I stood silent. When did I become that person?

Aside from loving it and being very much enlightened by it, I thought a lot about Thomas's character. Too Far Gone: These are Peter's thoughts about Thomas when he is at the concentation camp. I know it changes from first to second point of view right at the beginning, but I don't really want to change it because thoughts can change and take different paths during a reverie. I don't own Swing Kids or the characters Peter or Thomas. I don't know when it happened. I don't know when he finally slipped. Until the night of Arvid's suicide, I didn't realize that he had fallen for the Nazi propaganda hook, line, and sinker. And I had been falling for it, too. Jesus, it had started out as just a game- HJ by day, Swing Kid by night. Did Hitler Youth do that to everybody? This may come as a bit of a surprise, but I just have to say, thanks, Thomas. Your words were a wake-up call to me. When I saw what you'd become, I was never going to be one of them. Oh, what am I thinking? You weren't going to be one of them, either. You weren't supposed to be. I guess the horrible truth is that so many people can be bought in by the Nazi Party. But alas, my returned loyalty at the expense of your newly found one… and Arvid's death. It was your fault, Thomas, not mine. But it was so hard to hate you because you were my best friend. Sometimes, in the darkest parts of my stay here, I had even wished to be one of them. To be dragged down with you. To be on the side with all the advantages. God, it was so painful, the way they ripped us apart, the way they ripped everyone apart. Everyone says I was the stronger one, but I'm not so sure of that anymore. For the weaker you are, the stronger you must become to overcome your weakness. Thomas, I believe that you will overcome them someday. I will believe until the day that I die that you are not one of them. And perhaps you have overcome them already. The last day I ever saw you, you had almost beaten me to death. Then, you told me to run. And when I didn't, when I was being hauled away on that wagon, I saw you watching me. I believed in you, because you were so close to the surface now. Then, I looked at you again. Your face was blank. I saw fathoms and fathoms of emptiness, more foreign than ever before. And in that moment, I knew you were too far gone. You had saved me for old time's sake. You couldn't kill me, because you had become what all Nazis are- a coward. And then there was a change. You shouted 'Swing Heil!' after me. There's no telling what you are now and what you were in that moment. I only know that you shouted it in front of dozens of Hitler Youths. And at the moment, that didn't even matter. All that mattered was I knew you were back. But I have had a long, long time to ponder over it, and now it is all the world who you were around when you shouted it, for I know that my best friend chose his true side over his obligatory side. You became strong. Whether it was for the moment or all time, I do not know, and probably will never, for I don't expect to return. But even if it was for the moment, I still have high hopes for you. I saw how strong you were that day, and knew how strong you were from that point in your life onward. I have no doubt that you have the ability break away from the Nazi party. What you still may need is the will. Our friendship is destroyed beyond repair, I'm afraid to say. Even if I did make it out of here alive and could see you again, there would be nothing for us to say to each other. But I'm never going to make it out alive, I know that now. What I have seen here has taken complete control over me; the way I think and the way I look at things. Just like it had done to you. This time, I am the one who is too far gone. But it hadn't extinguished my morals, like you. What it had destroyed was my strength. But even if I'm destroyed, there's still hope for you. Now, as to if you have ever reformed, I will never know. But I will die never having lost my faith in you. What can I say? We just started out two swing kids, two rebels, with barely anything to rebel against. We weren't rebelling against the Nazis. We were rebelling against anybody who busted our clubs. We didn't even care about what the Nazis truly stood for. Just why did we hate them so much? Because we were kids and they were ruining our fun? Yes, that was it. That 'swing kid' we defended so long ago? The Jew? You couldn't care less about him. I always saw that side in you, Thomas, long before either of us were HJs. And now I can only hope that your guilt of what you, along with everyone in the Hitler Youth, had done, would change your views upon them for life. Maybe I am hoping for too much. What we were rebelling against was so different than the true rebellion against the Nazis. Maybe if we had known the difference, you wouldn't have become a Nazi and I wouldn't have become so close to becoming one. Maybe neither of us would've been too far gone.

He was on his feet in an instant, grabbing for one of the umbrellas in the nearby stand and calling out into the darkness. \"Who's there?\" he asked, and a pair of dark eyes appeared as someone stepped forward. \"Why are you covered in blood?\" a voice asked, and Thomas felt all the air rush from his lungs at once. Exhausted, he fell forward, barely catching himself on the banister. \"Effy, what are you doing here?\" he rasped, allowing her to undo the buttons for him and slip the nearly destroyed jacket off his shoulders. \"You're supposed to be with your family, in Switzerland.\" \"You didn't answer my question.

It's also the only one I'm the most proud of, thus I'm posting it here to be shown off. I hope you all enjoy it, and don't forget to review! And remember, I don't own these boys or anything in the Swing Kids 'verse for that matter. But you knew that already (I hope..) The three friends entered the club, feeling that sudden rush of excitement. Horns blared and drums beat off the sweet sound that captured everything that just made life seem so sweet. The tallest of the three, Peter Muller, gained a bounce in his step as he twirled his umbrella around in his one hand. A grin formed on his face, his brown eyes drifting over to the second tallest; Thomas Berger--his partner in crime. Thomas' smile spread from ear to ear. He shimmied out before his friends, twirling on his two-toned shoes, before gracefully slipping off his jacket. The jacket found it's way onto a chair at a vacant table before he slid onto the dance floor. Peter was quick to join, leaving the third of their group, Arvid, to find a seat at the table Thomas had claimed just moments ago. His clubed foot prevented him from dancing, but that didn't sway him from enjoying the music. He set out a sleek guitar case on the table, taking out his pride and joy. He had a gig that night, playing some Count Basie. Arvid would've preferred to play something from his favourite artist, Django Reinhardt, but he was known never to make a fuss whenrnit came to the genre of swing. Out on the dance floor, Thomas and Peter followed each other's lead, ducking and spinning, feet never missing a beat or a step. They were pros at what they did, and it showed in their enjoyment. The crowed quickly separated into a dance-off formation, as was a quite normal occurance in the swing clubs. Peter and Thomas immediately took center stage to show off their moves. The taller brunette took his performance solo, while Thomas pulled a girl from the crowd. She came willingly, and in her bright shoes and perfect dancing outfit, matched each of Thomas Berger's moves step for step, sway for sway. She was flipped and spun and led around in a routine entirely made up on the spot, though it seemed like a rehearsed number. The swing clubs, though hidden, were the only release the 'untainted' German youth had from Hitler and his dictatorship. As soon as the first song ended and the next one was about to begin, the club's Emcee took the stage and introduced Arvid to the crowed. He was met with cheers and applause, the crowd knowing his skills as well as they knew the moves of the dance. In a heatbeat, the band had started up again, playing that oh-so-familiar tune. Arvid strummed rhythmatically to the opening of the song, anxiously awaiting his solo while he glimpsed at the dancers on the floor. Flashy Zoot-suits and colourful dresses melded together in the mass of attendees. The night was still young and everyone knew it. Tonight was feeling like a perfect night where absolutely nothing could go wrong. Just as each song stopped and another begun, the smells of liquor and smoke rose in the atmosphere, easing the tensions of the days long labouring, discrimination, and in some cases, even the tension of having to hide religion from the Nazi soldiers. Thomas, Peter and Arvid were only highschool students. They went to school with a mix of students and knew the swingers from the Hitler Jugend. The jewish students had long-since been run out, save for the few who found a way of hiding it (including Arvid, but his friends hardly ever acknowledged that fact). The Hitler Jugend were rapidly taking over the belief of each and every 'pure' boy around, quickly deciding the 'masters' from the rest. They thrived on serving their country, and never disobeyed a single comand from their Führer. The three boys had been lucky not to get mixed up in the insanity of the war, but as it seemed, it would only be a matter of time. Most of their friends had enlisted and were trying to persuade them to do the same. Whatever excuses they came up with for reasons not to join must've been very good, being as they'd stayed out right up until this point, and even still had no intention on ever joining if they could help it. Yet another catchy song started up and found Peter and Thomas both with pretty and talented partners. Peter's was a regular; a girl whom he'd begun to really like, and the same went for her. Thomas, on the other hand, had a slew of girls who wanted to dance with him. He had a boyish charm and personality that must really radiate and just capture their spirits. With Thomas and Peter, itrnwas almost like dancing on air. Arvid continued to play with the band, his lightning fast fingers never missing a chord. He'd done it a million times before, yet each time he played, it seemed like a first. He continually got those rushes of excitement from being up there with the house band, imagining that he was probably in the exact same spot where many of his idols must've begun. His dark brown hair flopped down in his face and over his glasses as he got right into the beat yet again. The music was like oxygen, allowing Arvid to freely and easily keep in tune. It was when everyone had really gotten into the song when things began to get sour. The doors burst open to gasps and general mumbling as the band abruptly cut off in mid note, and those sorely despised uniforms broke into the room and through the crowd. Arvid jumped up from his spot on the stage as best as he could, slightly stumbling in his own clumbsiness. The club's MC quickly hurried him towards backstage, and the back exit in hopes of none of the HJ's who had just entered club catching him. On the dance floor, a mad frenzy began of swingers trying to get out of the club without being harmed or arrested. Peter and Thomas stayed calm with their dance partners held close. A silent and mutual agreement was made that they'd attempt to duck out the same way Arvid had managed to escape. Thomas and the two girls were edged on first, while Peter made a very quick swipe for their coats. His efforts were interrupted by a hand clamping down on his forearm. Peter's eyes trailed up the perfectly pressed fabric to meet the face of an old friend. It seemed yet another passionate swinger turned himself over to the other side. He went to jerk his hand away, and in successfully doing so, was returned with a fist meeting the side of his face. The pain echoed in his mind and through his nerves before he found the will to fight back, laying a punch of his own. Thomas stood out behind the club with Arvid and the two dance partners, bouncing on his spot as he shifted weight from foot to foot. His anxiousness and concern for Peter were bubbling up to a point where he felt like bursting back into the club. Arvid advised him against it, reminding him that Peter was capable of fighting. Back inside, the panic of swingers had changed to a full out brawl. The Hitler Jugend began to use sheer force to beat the harmless teenagers into submission. The luck ones who had gotten out would get their taste later; the HJ were becoming more resourceful, and with each swinger they recruited, another illegal swing club became known. Peter was extra lucky to be able to defend himself and eventually manage to slip out with only minor injuries. He quickly snuck around to meet with his friends, and once there, all three of them, including the girls continued to sneak away past the HJ's who were patroling the street in front of the club. That'd be the last time any of them would ever see that club.

I was posted as a guard at a concentration camp to prove my loyalty to the HJ and to the Fuhrer. I guessed they believed that to be some sort of promotion; from patrolling the streets to making sure none of the Jews or traitors tried to escape. I can honestly say that I don't recall which concentration camp I was posted at. Time has warped and the details of my life has blurred to the point of non-recognition ever since that night I betrayed him and became the cause for Peter's arrest. At the concentration camp, we were allowed to do pretty much whatever we wanted to prisoners. What were they to society? According to the Fuhrer and to the Nazi Party, these creatures were not people but some sort of animal. They were lesser than human for not being \"on the right side\", which means that the Nazis viewed Peter as lesser than human as well. Peter will never be lesser than human to me. He is everything that I am not and everything that the Nazi Party will never be. He is HUMAN. A true human being with compassion and a sense of right and wrong. He has, or had, the inner strength that I never possessed and for that, he is above all of us. But when I saw him, I could have been fooled. The love of my life, my childhood friend, was covered in torn rags with bruises adorning his dirt encrusted body. He looked as if he had gone through Hell, which is the case when one is a prisoner in a concentration camp. My heart wept for him. He, Peter, looked so ill, so weak. The fire in his eyes seemed dulled by whatever he has been through. I nearly dropped my gun, ran over to him, fallen to my knees, and wept while cradling his body. It took all the willpower I ever possessed to not follow through with the command my heart sent to my brain. If I had one wish in the world it would be to take Peter away from this horrid place; away from this destroyed Germany that has been beaten down into submission and turned into a prison by a blood-thirsty, delusional madman. I would nurse him back to health and everything would be better. I would bathe him and feed him and give him everything he needed. I would tell him how much I love him and I would make passionate and sweet love to him every night. He would receive all the love and attention I never gave him due to my cowardice and my pride. I would sacrifice life and limb for Peter. I wish…I wish I had done so before. I wish I had done so and never aided in his capture. Peter…how I regret doing that to you. All these thoughts ran through my head in the brief glimpse that I received of his broken figure. My love, how I long for you. I took a step closer but the crowd of sick and tortured souls engulfed him and I lost sight of Peter. I looked left and right, broke apart several groups of people huddled together; whether they were family or not, I did not know. All I could think about was finding him and…that's where my thought ended. I do not know what I would have done if I caught up to Peter. I do not know what I'd say but I know shame would course through my body as it is doing right now as I recount this memory. I lost Peter in the crowd and that was the last time I ever saw of him. I do not know if he lives or if he perished in that sick place. I only hope that the Nazis did not take everything away from him. I only hope that he still has a beat in his step and a song in his heart. The song of freedom. The song if human strength. The music of the Swing Kids.

Experiencentaught them to be quiet at least another hour after the last bootnfell on the wood floor above them, just incase. Analisenlooked up at him with her pretty green eyes, some smudges of eyelinernfrom the night they escaped still tracing them. She leaned in, hernlips pressing softly against his, her tongue worming her way into hisnmouth and wrapping around his own. He suppressed the moan thatnthreatened to escape from him, because he wasn't entirely sure thenNazis were gone yet. An hournlater she was asleep again. Her head in his lap, his fingers in hernhair and he was just on the edge of consciousness himself. Shenstirred slightly so that her eyes looked up at him, and he smiledndown at her. She took his hand in her own, lacing their fingersntogether with all the care of a lover. \"Peter,\"nAnalise whispered. \"When we get out of here, we should go tonAmerica.\" Henlaughed. \"Sure Ana. We'll go to America.\" \"Don'tnplacate. I mean it.\" She smiled. Hennodded. \"Andnwe'll get jobs working in Harlem at the best swing club there is.nI'll be a singer. You can tend bar. We can dance together on ournbreaks and our nights off. And we'll dance our way home in thenearly morning, under the stars.\" \"Thatnsounds good.\" He whispered. She gotnon her knees and leaned in, kissing him, pressing him against thenwall, the stone cold against his neck and the back of his head. Hernfingers went into his hair, his own resting on her waist. Therenwasn't a thing in the world but him, and her and that cold cellarnwhere they hid. Before he knew it, they were in the throws of makingnlove. And they fell asleep intertwined in each other. Legs and armsntangled together as if for that moment they'd become one, singlenbeing. She was curled up against him, her chest against hers. It wasnalmost certain, that their hearts were beating together, in time withnone another. \"Inwon't let them take you.\" He whispered, it was breathy andnmuffled by hair. She rannher fingers along his bicep. \"I won't let them take you either.nYou can't leave me. It won't be worth it to rescue me and bentaken yourself.\" \"Why donyou think that?\" He lifted her chin. Her eyesnwere filled with tears. \"Because I love you. I would rather dienthan know that if they find us and separate us, I lived while youndied for my safety. If they catch us, I want to go wherever they havenme scheduled to go. At least then I can die knowing I loved. And Indied loving.\" He feltnhis nose sting with the tears forming in his own eyes. He stroked herncheek, pushing aside some of her hair so he could look at her facenbetter. Peter leaned in and kissed her softly on the mouth. \"I lovenyou too. And I will do anything to save you. Ultimately there'snnothing I can do to make you save yourself. I just wish you would…nbecause if they take me, I want to know it wasn't in vain.\" \"Itnwon't be in vain.\" She smiled. \"You saved me just by doingnthis. I'd already be dead if you hadn't risked everything fornthis. And that for me, is enough. This will always be enough.\" Shensnuggled back against him. He stroked her hair, wordlessly. Hernconfession made him feel bittersweet. She was right. It was pointlessnto sacrifice himself. It would be ridiculous to imagine that shenwould be better off with him going off to the work camp or worse fornprotecting her. In the end, they'd likely find her again and she'dnget it ten times worse. She was always right. He kissed her forehead. \"You'renright. We'll always have this. And we'll let that be enough. Fornnow.\" Fin.[Chapter 2] Fournmonths previous He was waiting outsidenher door, impatiently. He knew she'd have to come out and henplanned to walk her to school as he had done since the first nightnthey'd met. He could see Thomas down the street looking annoyed andnslightly irritated by Peter's haulting of the trip. When Ana neverncame to the door and they had five minutes to make it before thenfirst bell, Peter figured she was ill today and he and his friend rannoff. On the second day shendidn't show he considered that she had a flu or perhaps a cold andnit kept her from feeling well enough for classes. On the third day henbegan to worry until Thursday afternoon when he saw her in the streetnshopping for groceries. He was with the HJ so made a point not tondisrupt her. He'd talk to her later. She didn't come tonany of the clubs that weekend so on Sunday morning, after church,nPeter brought what was left of mother's breakfast and knocked onnher door. When Analise answered she was in a robe and still lookednquite tired and slightly put off. \"Do you know whatntime it is? Peter you shouldn't be here.\" She barked. \"I've missed you!nWhere have you been? You disappeared on me. You haven't been atnschool and you haven't been dancing… \" Peter stepped closer. She backed furtherninto her home. \"I can't see you anymore. Good-bye Peter.\" Ana moved to close thendoor but he stopped it with his hand. \"Wait! Why?! Is it because ofnthe HJ thing? I know you hate them and I didn't have a choice… Intold you that.\" She flinched, and forna moment he saw tears in her eyes. He moved his hand, intending tonmake a bold move in and wrap his arms around her, sooth her tears.nBut Ana immediately slammed the door in his face. He stepped back tonavoid being hit, almost taking a fall down the stairs. He sighednheavily, looking at it before turning to leave, but was distracted byna piece of paper slipping under the door. Tonight at the CafénBismark. Don't be late. This will be the last time I see you. Peter looked it overnin disbelief. Crumpling it and shoving the note into his pocket, hentook off toward home. When he arrived, shenwas already there. She sat alone in a corner her eyes fixed on thentable in front of her, completely uninterested in the behavior aroundnher. Ana looked miserable, if he had to label it. When he sat withnher, she didn't even look at him. She had been crying. Peter couldntell by the black streaked tears on her cheeks. Leaning over henlifted her head and wiped her cheeks with his thumb. She jerked away. \"Stop.\" Shenhissed. \"Why? What is goingnon?\" He asked sounding confused. She said nothing, justnreturned her gaze down. He leaned back in his chair and studied hernhoping to get an idea of what was wrong with her by her bodynlanguage. He got no real read other than it was clearly disturbing. \"Okay. Analise younneed to tell me whats going on because the only way I can help is ifnI know the problem.\" He finally reasoned. \"You can't help.nYou won't help. I shouldn't have even come tonight.\" She got upnand headed for the door. He stood and took hernhand but she pulled away from him, shooting a warning look beforencontinuing out of the building. Still a bit put off, but notndiscouraged Peter followed her out the door. Once outside, he lookednfor her and jogged to catch up with her head start down the street. \"Ana wait!\" Hencalled. She didn't slowndown. \"Ana!\" Peter grabbed her bynthe hand and turned her to face him, like he'd done in the cafe.nThis time she didn't pull away or scowl or meet him with anger.nThis time she buried her face in his chest and began to sob. Henpulled her close, holding her against him. Her body shook in hisnarms, and though he had no idea what was wrong, his instinct was toncomfort her. \"Shh, it's okay.nWhatever's going on, I'm sure it'll work out.\" He saidnsoftly, rubbing her back. \"It won't worknout.\" She sobbed. \"It's never going to work out. They'rengoing to find me and they're going to send me away to God knowsnwhere or just kill me and you're in danger just by talking to me!nWhy don't you get it? Why don't you just go away?\" \"Ana… what are yountalking about? I love you. Why would I just go away? I don't knownwhat you're saying…\" \"I'm Jewish,nPeter!\" She almost screamed. If he hadn't knownnbetter, he could have sworn the world had just crumbled around them.[Chapter 3] He hadn't spoken tonher since her little reveal outside the café but not because henhadn't tried. He'd come over several times trying to get her tontalk to him, but she refused to see him And when they began raidnhomes for Jewish families and round them up to take them to camps,nPeter could only hope that Ana was in hiding. Every now and then henwould happen by the home and hope that she would peer out the windownfrom behind a curtain to signal to him that she was okay. Though, henimagined it was hard for her to find trust in him now, he was wellninto his position as an HJ. She hadn't talked to him in weeks,nthere was no way for her to know if he'd been brainwashed just likenThomas had been. Peter knew it was onlyna matter of time before he had to join in the raids himself. He hatednthe thought of going inside a family's home and kicking them outnjust because they were different. He hadn't been assigned to arrestnAna's home. He didn't even know that they were next until henhappened by as Nazi's broke down the door to go in. He'd nevernbeen so happy to be in his uniform. Following a group ofnthem inside he made his way through the home he was so familiar with,nlooking around trying to blend in as just another solider followingnorders. He made a passing remark to one of the other men, saying he'dnsee if there was an attic, before running up the staircase. Henwouldn't have found it if he hadn't seen the Star of David patchndropped on the ground just below it. The string was taped up againstnthe door in the ceiling so it would dangle and give away it'snlocation. Peter jumped up, grabbed the string and pulled down thenstairs. He made his way up thenstairs and then pulled them up behind him, once he'd found stablenfooting in the attic floor. As he turned, he was met with somethingnlarge and blunt nailing him across the face. He reeled, fallingnbackwards and landing on his butt holding his arms up to shieldnhimself. \"You asshole!\" Ananspit. \"I trusted you. And here you are to take me away like theyntook the rest of my family! I hate you!\" \"Ana wait!\" Hencalled, frantic as she raised her chair leg weapon again to hit him.n\"I'm here to help you!\" She stared at him,nskeptically at first but with shaking arms and her eyes quivering andnglassed over with the beginnings of tears, she lowered her arms andnput down the broken chair leg. \"How do you plan tonhelp?\" She asked, choking on tears. Peter melted andnwrapped his arms around her, slowly because she was still slightlynskittish. Her whole body was shaking but she was keeping silent andnforcing back her sobs so not to alert the men downstairs to his findnof her hiding up here. He rubbed her back soothing her shaken nerves. \"I don't know yet,nbut I'll find a way to help you.\" He whispered. She nodded burying hernhead into his chest to muffle the sobs she was losing control over.n\"They came for my family while I was out running errands. When Ingot home the place was trashed, my family was gone and they'dnmarked the door. I have been up here ever since, just waiting fornthem to come back for me.\" \"You aren't goingnanywhere.\" Peter told her. \"I won't let them take you.\" She looked up at himnwith tear stained and reddened cheeks, sniffling away the tears shenwas still trying to fight back. Ana gave him a long, examining starenas if she was trying to read his mind and see what was going throughnhis head. It was almost unnerving and he shifted slightly in hisnfooting. \"Why?\" Ananquestioned, \"Why would you do that? Why would you risk your life tonsave mine?\" Peter didn't miss anbeat. \"I'm in love with you.\" Ana leaned in on herntipped toes and planted a soft, gentle kiss on his lips. She leanednback down onto the soles of her shoes and looked away. The strong andnbreave girl he'd always known was replaced with someone blushingnand shy, a young girl experiencing her first romance. He smiled atnher, taking her cheek in his hand and tilting her head so her eyesnmet his. \"I'll be back…nwait here. Be quiet and hide. I'll come when it's safe. Don'tnmove until you hear the magic words.\" He told her. She gave him a smirk.n\"What are those.\" He made his way to thendoor in the floor that would take him out of the attic. \"I lovenyou. Then he pushed it downnand disappeared down the steps. Peter Mueller hadnnever considered himself a dishonest person. He did his share ofnlittle white lies, because he was a teenager and sometimes his motherndidn't need to know all his details. So sometimes when his marksnwere a bit off par, or he was out later than he should be, he toldnhis mother something a little skewed from the truth. He always feltnguilty for it later. But as the stairs went back into the ceiling andnthe string followed, making it invisible again, he could have beennthe greatest liar. The lie slipped through his lips like a knifenthrough butter. \"There's no one upnthere.\" He told the Nazi in charge. The Nazi looked himnover, as if tracing him with an internal lie detector before nodding.n\"Well then I guess we're done here. She's probably gone by now.nIf she comes back here, she's the stupidest Jew in Germany.\" The comment madenPeter's blood run a bit faster and more heated as the anger stayednstrangled just below boiling point, so not to give them away. He gavena nod and followed as the commanding officer lead the Nazi troops tonthe door. On managed to clap him on the back. \"Give it time boy,nyou'll get to have all the fun too.\" He said, and then walked offna head. Present \"Peter.\" Hernvoice, soft and groggy pulled him back into the current events. \"Yes?\" He croaked,nhis voice horse from lack of use. \"Why are you awake?\"nShe yawned. \"How did you know Inwas, mein schatzi?\" He replied. Ana sat up andnstretched a little, rubbing sleepily at her eyes from her placennuzzled against his chest. She then leaned down beside her, her elbownpropping up her arm with her hand holding her head up. She gave him ansleep smile. \"Your heart is fast.nWhen you sleep it's slower.\" He smirked. \"I wasnthinking about when you hit me with the chair leg in your attic.\" She scoffed. \"Oh,nlet it go Peter.\" He laughed and gave hrna peck on the nose. She pecked his lips and ruffled her hair with hernfree hand. \"I love you.\" Shensaid softly. Before he could reply,nthey heard footsteps above and the creak of the floorboards beingnpulled up from their place in the floor. Mein schatzi mynlittle treasure ","Summary":" They'dnsat in silence for the past few hours. All he could hear was thenpound of his heart against "},{"Movie":"Swing Kids","Title":"The Riot Side","Author":"kweenofalldreams13","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5805126","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chains \"Screw ya,\" I muttered under my breath, tugging on Astrid's arm. She followed clumsily, her feet dragging along with her as she continued to ramble nonsense in an undertone. It was the same, always the same: \" Astrid a good girl, Astrid good, Astrid no hurt people, not hurt people! \" Nights would end with her crying, and Mama crying, and Papa yelling, and me with my hands over my ears with the worlds swirling around me. I wasn't going to tell them about this one, that this time they'd caught us trying to get into the big, main record store when Astrid was retarded. \"Screw ya, screw ya, screw ya,\" Astrid repeated, and I rolled my eyes, clutching her arm in my hand and a thick stack of books to my chest. I wasn't used to this responsibility, lugging Astrid around with me everywhere I went, but now, now that we were in Hamburg and Mama had gotten sick and Papa had to work full-time, now she was slung upon me, something I wasn't accustomed to and something I never knew I would need to be. Sure, Astrid was my sister, and yes, I loved her, but I wasn't used to handling...someone like her. Caught up in my thoughts, I smashed into a few young men passing by, scattering the books everywhere, and I released Astrid for a split-second to collect them all back up again, feeling my heart drop through my toes. Two horrible things were going to come out of this: one, they would be members of the stupid, vile HJ and condemn Astrid for her mental disability, and two, Astrid would lose the calm she bore when life was balanced, and she would have another of her fits. Thankfully, neither of these happened immediately, and two of the boys stooped down beside me to hand me my books. I breathed heavily, panting due to my fears at what could have gone on, but didn't, thank the Lord, and praying that Astrid would just stay quiet and look down to her feet as always, and maybe the government would believe her almost normal; besides, it wasn't as though she was stupid, she was very good at math and sciences, but when you got her around people things were a train-wreck. The pair of them handed me the books, and two others behind them stood dutifully, one wearing spectacles and a hat and the other with blond hair and large eyes. The two were more handsome than their counterparts, though slightly less with the one with thicker eyebrows. I sighed out, hoping it would serve alright as thanks. \"No problem, doll...hey, haven't I seen you around?\" the one with the eyebrows queried and I shrugged, looking down to my books and reaching back for Astrid, who loyally gripped my hand in hers. \"Just started going to the Academy a few weeks ago, didn't you?\" I nodded this time, holding my breath in, lest it anger one of them. The Nazis didn't care if you had friends or a family or dreams...if you looked one way, spoke one way, smelled one way, they would slaughter you, just slaughter you for what you were. They didn't care... \"You can talk, can't you?\" the handsome one quipped, quirking his eyebrow at me. I nodded. \"Well, go on.\" \"I'm very sorry I bumped into you, but really, my sister and I must go home–\" I stammered, trying to brush past them once more, but the handsome one grabbed onto my arm. An odd feeling sparked in my stomach, arms, and legs, and I stopped in my tracks. \"Hey, hey, we're not gonna hurt you or anything. Here, I'll even tell you my name. See, I'm Thomas, Thomas Berger, king of the Castle Bismarck,\" he boasted, his chest expanding considerably, and I noticed the grey trousers he wore, with grey suspenders, a white shirt and a black tie, and one navy coat over it. \"See, now it's your turn, little lady. What's your name?\" \"Adelaide Schultz,\" I mumbled under my breath, \"and this is my sister Astrid. Now I'm really very sorry, but we must go home.\" \"Well, Adelaide and Astrid, two young ladies such as yourselves shouldn't ever walk Hamburg's streets alone, even now during the daylight,\" Thomas interrupted once more, his eyes growing large with enthusiasm. \"Perhaps it would be wiser for us to accompany you home?\" The back two looked uneasy, but Thomas and his counterpart seemed comfortable. I did not want to be taken advantage of, so I shook my head. \"No, no, really, it's all fine. We'll be off now, thank you very much for your concern, but my sister and I shall be fine. Thank you, thank you,\" I said hurriedly, and pushed past them, clenching onto Astrid's hand so tightly she half-cried out. I released my grip on her a little bit. \"I'm sorry, Astrid.\" Her eyes lost the pained look and went blank again. \"Sorry,\" she parroted. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry.\" I blew out another sigh, and kept walking quickly as fast as I could, taking as many backroads as I knew to avoid those damned Hitler Jugen, or worse, the twice as damned, twice as God-forsaken Gestapo, those evil, vile, dictatorial devils. I half-skipped, dragging Astrid along by her inflated hand, and she followed along, until we reached home and we were safe for now.[Chapter 2] Meine Alte Welt As Astrid and I slid through the front door, we found the house entirely empty and silent. Most likely, Mama was probably already asleep in her bed in her and Papa's room, and Papa was at work, per usual. Astrid started to wriggle about, looking uncomfortable in her blouse and jacket and wool skirt. I thought I knew. \"You need a bath, Astrid?\" I asked her, as she wrenched her hand out of mine to tug on the collar of her blouse, and her head bobbed like a duck's. \"Do you want me in the washroom with you or do you want to try this time yourself?\" She shrugged her shoulders over and over, and started to the washroom. I followed, turning away when she disrobed to start the water, and I filled it with as many bubbles as the damn Gestapo would let us have, as they knew of Astrid's condition and considered her one of the condemned retarded. We were under such close watch, what with her being the way she was. She climbed in, and I shut off the water. I sat down beside the tub, holding a bottle of shampoo and a soap-on-a-string for her. \"Ask the questions!\" Astrid ordered, splashing at our silence. I wiped a bubble away from my skirt. \"Five to the third power,\" I said to her, and she closed her eyes and huffed in exasperation while I squirted a fat lump of shampoo into her open, waiting hands. \" Hard questions!\" she demanded. \"Fine,\" I sighed, obedient, and tried to recall the problems in a book an old professor of mine had given my sister. It seemed in the old days that nobody but me and Mama really bothered to try and understand what went on (or what didn't) in Astrid's head. Nobody but me, Mama and old Professor Zimmermann. Professor Zimmermann had been my old statistics teacher back in Cologne. The first day of class, he went around the room, shook everyone's hand, and asked their names and what they wanted to do for a career. And then, once everyone was there and accounted for, he went around, reciting all our names and our aspirations. He was strict school-wise but he was witty and clever at the same time. He was my favourite professor of all. One time Papa fell off the roof when he was trying to fix a few of the broken shingles. I was at school, at an extra tutoring session with some of the other members of my class and Professor Zimmermann. Mama dropped Astrid off with me at tutoring so she could take Papa to the hospital. A bunch of the kids who were with us made these stupid comments and jokes about her and the way she talked and the way she acted and I just about snapped. I got ready to just leave and take Astrid with me, but he stopped them and made them apologize. He asked the two of us to stay after the tutorial was over, and we went into his office. He asked us questions about our family and our lives and things, and after we'd spent hours in that office, he finally dismissed us. He handed Astrid a book on the way out with all kinds of math problems, her favourite things, and smiled at her and she said thank you. He actually treated her like a person and not just another retard, like the rest of them when they saw her. I had full respect for him from that day on. He was my favourite professor and Astrid's too, whenever she was around my school. \"Towel,\" said Astrid, holding out her small, puffy hand to me. I gave it to her, leaning down to unplug the drain and let the water swirl down it. The radio sounded from Mama's room, a loud beat of a classical German polka. I twirled a little in the washroom. Astrid started twirling as well, in her towel, too. She dried off and fixed on her fresh clothes and the two of us both danced the polka in little circles. Astrid was laughing and I was laughing and we collapsed on the floor in a laughing fit. \"Girls! I'm home!\" Papa yelled from the front door, and Astrid jumped up, pushed past me and into the foyer, where Papa was. I threw her towel into the to-do laundry basket on the way there. \"Afternoon, Adelaide, my lovely. How are you, darling?\" He kissed me tenderly on the cheek, and squeezed me to his side. \"It was good, Papa. Astrid was a good girl today, weren't you, Astrid?\" \"Good girl,\" Astrid repeated mechanically, rocking happily from side to side. \"Good girl, good girl, good girl, good girl.\" \"That's right, Astrid,\" I confirmed, ruffling her hair and laughing when she shuddered. \"You were a lovely girl today.\" In turn, she squeezed my hand. \"Adelaide, what are you up to, tonight, I mean? Do you have any dates with any of these wild Hamburg boys yet?\" he jested. I blushed and shook my head. \"Why, then go get some, sweetie. Go make some plans, I'll take care of your sister and your mama. Go get ready, dress up. God knows you've had enough to worry about since we've come here.\" He kissed me on the top of the head and I sighed my thanks. \"Go on dear, get yourself lookin' gorgeous. The boys are sure to drop dead for ya.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Papa! Actually telling me to go out and enjoy myself for once, not just to mind Astrid, or watch Astrid. I felt free again, freer than I'd been since we left Cologne for this mad city.[Chapter 3] Mit Ihnen Gerade Tanzen \"What's a young lady like yourself doing out here in the middle of the night, where you could be corrupted by some nasty HJs?\" growled a voice from behind me, and I whipped around with a closed fist, hoping I could just make contact and run. \"Ow! Jesus Christ, that's the last time I sneak up on you, sweetheart. I'm sorry.\" I turned to look at the boy from today, nursing a bloody and fat lip. I clapped my hand over my mouth and tugged my handkerchief out from my purse, dabbing at his lip. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't expect–I mean, I just–\" \"No need to apologize to this halfwit, baby, he's always digging himself a hole,\" said one of the handsome boy's counterparts, one whose name still eluded me. \"Don't know if we got around to it, but it's Otto.\" He offered his hand and I shook it. The one with the eyebrows offered his next, a genial grin crossing his boyish face. \"Peter.\" Next was the one with the glasses who clutched his umbrella as if for life. \"Arvid,\" he nodded. Behind the boys, the final one, was a girl, shaking her head good-naturedly. \"Evey,\" she told me, smiling kindly. I smiled at them all, feeling a bit taken by all the appearances of people all around us. \"Pleased to meet you,\" she added, and I said the same. Her smile was warm and motherly. \"Getting back to my question now, what are you doing out here in the middle of the night all by your lonesome in this fine attire?\" Thomas asked, quirking his eyebrow, as his eyes ran me up and down. \"It's gettin' mighty late, isn't it, guys? Where were you heading off to at this time, sweetheart?\" I shrugged. \"Well, then, I suppose you wouldn't mind coming with us to a little spot we hang around at every so often.\" \"What did you have in mind?\" I inquired. I hoped I would catch on to whatever it was they wanted me to be a part of... \"It's all a simple question, really,\" Thomas insisted, draping an arm over my shoulders with that lopsided grin on his handsome face, even with his lip split from my stupidity. Peter rolled his eyes in good nature. \"Do you, uh, d'you like swing or are you on the side of the Hitler Jackasses?\" He said it as a joke but I blushed anyways. Could he really think that I, with a mentally disabled sister, could possibly be on the side of the Hitler Jugend? \"Honestly, I–I don't really know much about it. Is it very good?\" Thomas and Peter let out an identical low whistle and looked at each other in amazement. \"What is it? Have I said something amiss? I'm sorry, I should be going–\" \"You gotta come with us, then, we'll convert you. She'll be a hep kitten in no time,\" Thomas said confidently to the rest of them and Evey stifled a laugh. \"Making yourself another project, eh, Berger? What if this girl's actually smart and doesn't fall for your ridiculous charm?\" she taunted him, eyebrows raised. She was so pretty, so much prettier than I was. I remembered seeing her in school one time, thinking that because she was so pretty she had to be conceited, like all other pretty girls out there. But no, she wasn't. I supposed not all pretty girls were conceited. \"Eh, this one oughta work out. Look at you, huh, Evey? Just a few weeks ago, didn't you say you'd never be caught at the Bismarck and look at you now, a total hep kitten along with us for the ride against those damn ickies!\" Thomas sounded so joyful, so insistent. \"She'll certainly end up just as jazzy and swingin' as you've become, kiddo.\" She rolled her eyes at him again but he started some little jive out in the middle of the street until Peter socked him on the shoulder, his eyes crinkled up in laughter. \"Come on, let's get going, you're making an ass out of yourself again. Adelaide, were you coming with us?\" Peter inquired in a gentlemanly manner, offering up a smile. I looked about me, but this time there was no Papa and no Astrid to make a decision for me. The decision was my own to make. Thomas dramatically offered a heroic arm, bending down to a knee and raising his eyebrows expectantly. \"Yeah, I guess I'll go,\" I answered, taking his arm and hoping I knew what exactly I was getting myself into. When we passed into the club, I felt extremely foreign. People were dancing and and whooping to a music that was alien to my ears. The way they moved amazed me and frightened me all at once. Girls were flung over men's shoulders, swinging their legs and arms about like rag doll. I stared with my jaw agape. Thomas looked at me with a grin. \"Wanna give it a shot?\" he offered. \"I have no idea how to do that !\" I exclaimed, nodding at a girl flying over a man's shoulders, doing twists and turns in the air. \"Aw, no worries, sweetheart, I'll show ya, we'll start off with all the basics. You'll be fine in my hands,\" he promised, flashing me a wink. I continued to stare as the men flapped their arms about in wide circles. \"Can you make it so I don't show my knickers off to nearly everyone ?\" I gasped, and Thomas burst out laughing. Instead of giving me a verbal answer, he grabbed onto my hand and dragged me out onto the dance floor. He began to give me some instruction on how to twirl, how to spin. I started to get the hang of it, and Thomas flung me over his shoulder, spinning around, and then set me down, slid me between his legs and back up again. \"You're doing great, just great doll, keep it up and you'll be a swing girl in no time,\" he whispered in my ear, and just as he did, the music changed to a slower, more mellow beat. Thomas changed our positions, slinging an arm around my waist and letting my hand drift over his with the other. His forehead met mine and those twinkling eyes smiled into mine. \"Well, thanks for teaching me,\" I breathed, a weird feeling rising up within me. He glided us around the dance floor, keeping me steady even when I thought I was going to go completely weak in the knees and fall to the ground. When the song ended, Thomas led me over to a table where sat Otto, Arvid, Peter, Evey, and a new girl I didn't recognize. She stood up to introduce herself as Helga. I nodded and introduced myself. She seemed pleasant enough. After taking a break from time to time most of us got back up and dancing, except for Arvid, who usually just sat at the table talking to Helga or Otto, depending on who was off dancing, but a little later on he pushed away from the table and hobbled up to the stage with a guitar case in hand. He sat down, undid the case, and withdrew from it a gorgeous little guitar. One of the emcees sent him an introduction as \"the Hitman meets Count Basie\" and the crowd cheered. And then he started to play. His guitar felt like butter on my ears and immediately I was dragged up by Evey to go dance. It wasn't what you'd call serious swing, but we were having fun and laughing. Curfew was almost up, though, and I realised this just moments before the clock decided to turn against me. I rushed to the table to grab my coat and my purse and get out the door before I felt a hand grab down on my arm. \"Where are you going?\" Thomas shouted over the music. \"I have to go, I have curfew in a few minutes.\" He sighed and departed from the girl with whom he was dancing to get his coat from the chair he'd once occupied. The girl sent me a look of deep discontent before sauntering away to dance with some other swing boy. \"I'll walk you home,\" Thomas promised, and he and I exited through a back door, he with his hand on the small of my back, as though to guide me. The air outside felt refreshing, cold as it stung my cheeks, but new and not so filled with the indistinct combinations of men's colognes and women's perfumes. \"While I walk you, is it alright if I talk to you, too?\" I nodded. \"Of course. Anything.\" \"What about your sister?\" \"Anything but that,\" I answered, looking down to my feet. It figured. The only time I was absent of Astrid, I had to have some kind of nagging reminder. \"I'm sorry,\" Thomas apologized, rubbing his arm up and down. \"Did you have a good time tonight?\" I nodded wordlessly, my face still burning from the ugly, overprotective feeling deep in my stomach. \"I'm real glad you came. For someone who doesn't listen to swing, you sure dance it well.\" \"Thank you,\" I muttered. Then Thomas did something I didn't expect–he reached down and grabbed my hand into his sending me a confused look as though asking for my permission. I encouraged him, a small smile rising up onto my face. He mimicked it and my heart beat two times faster. He really was very handsome, with playful dark eyes that twinkled mischievously and long blond hair that framed his chiseled face. His collar was popped up and his ears were pink from the cold. He held onto his umbrella like the rest of them did, as though it was their instrument. I remembered the way I had once felt about the flute, back as a child. It was like a child to me. \"You know, Hitler might not see it, what with his Aryan agenda, but you are absolutely gorgeous. And that dress only makes you look lovelier in this light.\" And his words only made my cheeks grow redder in that light. The rest of the way we walked to my house with my face flaming and my heart pounding violently in my chest. Upon arriving at my house, Thomas pulled my other hand into his. \"Looks like this is your stop. G'night, doll.\" \"Goodnight, Thomas,\" I mumbled, making the bold move to kiss his cheek. I adjourned into the house with pictures of swing boys permanently burned into my mind. ","Summary":" Chains \"Screw ya,\" I muttered under my breath, tugging on Astrid's arm.

I pushed Cruz to the ground telling him, \"dude, we used to be best friends, what happened to you\". I start waling home again and as I am Cruz says \"yeah run you little bitch\". I should have just have ignored and kept walking but I said back \"shut up you gay tard, which was supposed to mean gay retard. Him and Chris then disappear behind a hill. As I am on a narrow path next to a lot of trees Someone grabs me from being putting me into a full nelson lock. It was Chris. Then Cruz comes up and delivers three punches straight to my chest and then lets out a big kick to my shin. My shin was bleeding and I can barely walk.

Misgiving. My \"everything\" has stabbed my perception of love. Causing me to only feel one emotion. Hate. But I realize you must love yourself for hate does nothing but kill. Peace steadily comes along And replaces you, lost, misunderstood for days, weeks, months but I finally do gain something, I realize you are your own vibe. Match yourself. Compete with yourself. Who are we to judge someone? Who are we to say who to fall in love with? Or how to fall in love? What is love? Because you shouldn't ever have to contradict yourself if you have it, if you share it with your significant other. I found love where it wasn't supposed to be.

I am so excited to finally be writing this story. It is an Ice age: Continental Drift fiction were instead of catching Shira, Captain Gutt catches Diego(this is the ship chase part). There is no cussing in this story, but there is some blood. I really hope you enjoy the story. \"One thing Sid!\" yelled Manny at the paralyzed sloth, \"You couldn't do one thing!\" Sid just lay there and groaned while, completely oblivious to the herd, the ship got caught by the current and started to sail away. \"Look at you,\" said Manny, pulling on Sid's eyelid. \"Sid, can you hear me?\" \"ByBy,\" said granny to the leaving ship. It was only then that the herd became aware of the situation, both of the leaving ship and the pirates charging at them. \"We gotta catch it before it hits open water!\" cried Manny. They started to chase the ship on a rough path. Along this path, Manny hit Sid's head on several rocks. \"Sorry, I'll hold yah higher.\" Sid's head then hit on some branches, \"Sorryyy.\" said Manny. The ship was starting to gain speed. Manny threw Sid at the deck of the ship, but he slid of the other side fortunately landing on a small ice float much to the relief of Manny. \"I'm coming Sid,\" Manny pushed over rock pillar, jumped onto it along with Diego and Granny, landed on Sid' float lunching him into the air, and caught him in his trunk exclaiming, \"Gotch yu.\" Seeing this and have rage build up in him even more, Capitan Gutt whistled and two narwhals shot out of the water. He jumped down and landed on the narwhals stating menacingly, \"I'm comin' for ya mammoth.\" as he shot forward with great speed. Manny thought fast and leaned back on the float causing the narwhals to slam into the side of it and ran it into ground. The herd slid on the ice toward a ramp that would throw them onto the ship, but unfortunately, Diego hit a rock jutting out of the ice sending granny (who was riding on his back) sliding onto the ship with the others. Diego staggered to his feet and chased after his herd that was now on the ship and about to leave the cove. As he came around a corner and heard Manny call to him, \"Diego! Come on!\" Diego charged along the path and was almost there when Shira came out of no where and pounced on him, pinning him to the ground. Seeing this, Manny picked up a log in his trunk and stuck it in the ice wall and pulled to hold the ship back. \"Why are you doing this!?\" cried Diego. \"You don't understand,\" said Shira, \"I don't have a choice.\" \"You don't have to live this way, Shira,\" said Diego, \"you'll be safe with us, we take care of each other.\" \"Diego!\" Manny cried in a strained voice, \"I can't hold on much longer!\" Just then, the log broke and the ship started moving again. Shira let Diego up and he said \"Come with us, come with me.\" Shira thought for a second then nodded. They started running again. As they ran to catch the ship, Diego looked back over his shoulder and seen Gutt about to grab Shira. He jumped up and spun in the air so as to land on Gutt. As he landed, he seen Shira jump and land safely on the ship. He turned to follow Shira but was stopped by an enraged Capitan Gutt. Gutt grabbed Diego tightly by the lower back, stabbing his claws into his side. Diego roared in pain and tried to twist around to slash at Gutt's face. But Gutt caught him by the neck and squeezed, forcing him to the ground. \"Your not going anywhere.\" said Gutt with an evil smile. \"Diego!\" Shira cried. \"Let him go ya freak!\" yelled Manny. \"I'm not letting him go any where, mammoth,\" said Gutt menacingly, \"I still have to get my revenge, and I will have it.\" Diego struggled under Gutt's grip, clawing at his hands, but it was in vain as Gutt just squeezed tighter. By then, the rest of Gutt's crew had caught up. Diego's vision was blurring from a lack of oxygen and he finally past out. Gutt lifted Diego of the ground and threw him to his crew who laughed as they swarmed around him and threw vines around him, tying him up, and dragged him away. \"See you at the main land mammoth!\" said Gutt as he turned to walk away, \"Oh, and Shira, I'll make you sorry you be trade me. See you at the main land.\" \"No.\" whispered Shira. Well, there's the first chapter. I know it was short, and I was thinking that I will ether make longer chapters that come occasionally, or short chapters that come often. So please tell me what you think about the story and please give me your thoughts and ideas because I really want to know.

Peter is in a concentration camp, and Thomas is there. I'm trying to be fairly historically accurate, so if you have any information that I don't, please pass it on! Edited for character mistakes. Peter's frail body ached as it never had before. His torso was covered with deep bruises, and the cuts were so numerous on his limbs that he appeared striped. He had now been in Neuengamme, a concentration camp near Hamburg, for six months. This particular day had begun with roll call before dawn, and stretched on with so many hours of labor that Peter had forgotten when he'd started. It was now late at night, and he was lying in the bunk he shared with two other young men, wide awake. He yearned for sleep, but his mind would not turn off. Thoughts spun like dervishes in his head. Were Willi and their mother doing all right? Where was Evey? Had she been captured? Had she even been at the Bismarck that horrific night? He couldn't remember. And where was Thomas? Had he realized the truth that Peter had tried so hard to impart to him? Peter prayed it was so. Peter did not sleep that night. Instead, he prayed. He had become a Christian shortly after imprisonment, from a man named Johann in his barracks. Johann had hidden Jews in his home ever since Hitler's reign of terror had begun in 1933, and had been arrested a year before. He now spent all the time he could witnessing to everyone and anyone who would listen to him. Peter had been led to Christ by Johann, and Peter was so thankful. He didn't know what his life would be like now if he hadn't surrendered it to Jesus. \"Jesus, I know you're here with me tonight, and with Johann, but Lord, please be with Thomas. Let him know that I'm alive. Let him know that I'm not going to give up. And, Lord, please let him know You. He needs You so much, Lord.\" Peter then fell into a restful sleep, for a few hours, until roll call. Miles away, in Hamburg, Thomas was awake, too. He wondered where Peter was. He'd heard months before that most of the swing kids had been taken to Neuemgamme, but he hadn't been able to secure a post there. He laid his heart open, but to whom he did not know. He just talked into the night, not caring who heard. \"I'm sorry. Sorry that I turned in my father, and sorry that I hurt Peter. I'm so sorry.\" Just saying the words made him feel much better. And somehow, he knew that Peter was alive. He just knew. This comforted him, and he promised himself that he would try as hard as possible to get a post at Neuemgamme. He had to. A week later, mostly through the work of Herr Knopp--the Gestapo man who was now married to Peter's mother--he had his post. He swallowed hard as he entered the camp. He had to find Peter. Peter was sluggishly completing his tasks, praying that he would move quickly enough to please his overseers, but slow enough that he wouldn't pass out from working. His parched lips cracked, but he pressed on. The Nazis were watching. He turned toward his overseers to report on his progress, and was shocked when he saw a familiar face approaching. Thomas? Thomas spotted Peter's weak frame instantly, and almost ran to his former friend. He held himself in check. Instead of running to Peter's side, Thomas reported to his superior, who assigned him to watch over Peter's group, as training. Thomas couldn't believe his luck! He marched to the overseers, saluted, and watched Peter. The tears in his eyes almost gave him away, but he forced his face into a contorsion of anger and ridicule. This was the expression Peter found on Thomas's face when he looked up. Anger. Ridicule. What had the Nazis done to Thomas? Was he truly as hardened as he appeared? His heart sank as he realized that Thomas hadn't changed, but instead continued down a path of destruction, littered with memories of friends and family betrayed. That was the moment Peter began to weep silently for his friend. This is only the first of many chapters (hopefully) to come, and I would appreciate feedback![Chapter 2] Many thanks to Shawcross Gal, who is writing Bei Mir Bist du Schon , the story that inspired me to write mine. Thomas watched over Peter that whole day, trying to invent a way of escape, but he couldn't think of one. He tried dozens of scenarios in his head, but they all had too many variables to be an option. Day after day passed like this. Thomas did not--could not--say anything to Peter, and it was tearing him to pieces. He knew that Peter thought that he hated him, and he couldn't do anything about it. One day, Peter was not working quickly enough. An overseer stood over him and beat him with a club. \"No!\" Thomas could not hold it in any longer. He tore the club from his fellow overseer's hands before he knew what he was doing. \"Are you going soft, Berger? Having pity on this traitor?\" the overseer demanded. \"No.\" Thomas lied. \"You aren't doing it correctly. It's like this.\" He demonstrated by beating Peter as hard as he could, but trying to strike where Peter was yet untouched. Peter collapsed completely under the rain of fresh blows, and Thomas almost choked on the lump in his throat. What had he done? Thomas yanked Peter to his feet. \"Stand up, swine!\" he yelled roughly. Peter struggled to stand on his own, but couldn't. He fell back to the ground. \"Take him to the hospital!\" he ordered the overseer. \"Are you mad, Berger?\" \"Take him.\" Thomas insisted. \"I want him to be strong so I can work him to death personally.\" Thomas grinned wolfishly, masking the wretchedness he felt within. The overseer nodded and hauled Peter to his feet. He then escorted Peter to the hospital. Thomas waited for night to fall the next day, and then he went to see Peter. He roused Peter from sleep by touching him on the shoulder. Peter reacted in stark terror, and suddenly Thomas had a terrible flashback of when Arvid had been in the hospital. \"Peter, hush.\" Thomas restrained his friend, wanting to retch at the sight of Peter. He had done this to him. \"I'm here to take you away.\" \"Where?\" Peter managed painfully, a thread of fearfulness winding its way through the word. \"Out of here. To Evey's. To my house--I don't know--just out of here!\" \"Can you take me home?\" Peter asked, almost childlike. \"I'm so sorry, Peter. I can't. Your mother married that Gestapo swine, Herr Knopp.\" \"No.\" Peter gasped. \"Yes.\" Thomas nodded. \"I'm so sorry, Peter.\" Thomas took the opportunity of a change of staff to lift Peter from the bed. He almost cried at how light Peter was--he weighed no more than a small child. They escaped by foot under the cover of night, right under the nose of a sleeping watchman. Neuegamme wasn't too far from Hamburg, and Evey lived on the outskirts of town. They made it to her house in the wee hours of the morning. Thomas knocked as quietly as possible on the door. Evey answered almost immediately. \"Thomas?\" she gasped. Then she saw the limp form in Thomas's arms. \"Peter!\" \"Can he stay here, Evey?\" Thomas asked. \"I'm so sorry, Thomas; he can't. My mother, like Peter's, married a Nazi to secure standing. Peter wouldn't be safe staying here.\" \"Where can we go, then?\" Thomas asked. \"Arvid's apartment!\" \"What?\" \"Helga's been living there. Her family kicked her out for dating a cripple. She can help you.\" \"Do you have a way for us to get there without me having to carry Peter?\" \"Yes. Wait around back.\" Evey disappeared back into the house, and Thomas carried Peter around to the back of the house. Evey met them there with a bicycle and small cart. Thomas placed Peter in the cart, covered him with an old blanket, and took him to Helga's apartment. As he biked through the streets of Hamburg, he noticed how deserted they were. People were afraid of curfew, he supposed. Helga met them at the door; Evey had called her. She took Peter from Thomas and settled him into the bed. \"You're a good man, Thomas Berger.\" she whispered. Now, Thomas was presented with two problems--he had to be back by dawn at the camp, and he had to return Evey's bicycle and cart. He quickly bid Helga goodnight and returned to Evey's house. He related his plan to her, and she acquiesced. Thomas biked as fast as he could to the camp, Evey riding on the handlebars. They reached Neuegamme just as dawn was breaking. Catcalls from various guards sounded as Thomas jumped off the bike and relinquished it to Evey. \"Hey, Berger, what's a classy girl like that doing with you out all night?\" one guard shouted. Thomas just smiled and shrugged. \"I don't know. But I don't really care for her--her stepfather is a block leader in Hamburg.\" \"Thought you were a man of morals, Berger!\" \"No; I'm a national socialist!\" he joked, a comment which was met with laughter. \"Did you hear about the guy who escaped last night?\" one of the guards asked him at breakfast. \"No.\" Thomas shook his head and gulped a mouthful of coffee. \"That kid you were beating up yesterday. The traitorous H.J. and former swing kid.\" \"How'd he get out? I nearly beat him senseless.\" Thomas commented, lamenting that the fact he'd just told was completely true. \"I don't know--probably another prisoner. A few went missing last night, but two were tracked down and shot. He's the only one who got away. Must have had someone waiting on the other side for him.\" Thomas breathed a sigh of relief. They would search for Peter, but probably not thoroughly. He was one of thousands of prisoners, with few guards to keep track. \"You okay, Berger? Not green at the thought of traitors being shot, are you?\" Thomas shook his head. \"No. They don't belong here.\" Thomas said, knowing that they would take his words as meaning the prisoners deserved to be dead. What he really meant was that all so-called \"traitors\" deserved to be free.[Chapter 3] A/N: This is the last chapter, it's long, and lots happens! Thanks for reading! Peter woke in Arvid's old apartment. Helga was watching him, making sure nothing happened. \"Water...\" Peter gasped. Helga got him a glass, and cradled him into a sitting position so he could sip. Then she fed him a small square of toast. \"If you have too much at one time, you can die.\" she told him bluntly. \"Your stomach isn't used to regular food.\" Peter nodded weakly and drifted back to sleep. Days went by like this. Helga slowly nursing Peter back to health, and both friends wondering if Thomas was okay. \"Berger--we've got another cart for the ovens.\" Thomas's superior instructed him to take the cart to the ovens and help the men there burn the bodies. Thomas almost retched at the sight and smell of death. \"Still green, Berger?\" his superior chuckled. \"No, Sir!\" Thomas replied, saluting. Then he completed his task. That night, he stole away early from his shift, and traveled to Helga's apartment. She let him in after he softly gave the signal he'd never forgotten--\"It Don't Mean A Thing.\" \"How is Peter?\" Thomas asked as the pair mounted the stairs. \"Better.\" Helga said. \"Much better than he was.\" They entered the room where Peter lay on the bed. \"Peter!\" Thomas crossed the room and enveloped his best friend in a gentle hug. \"Thomas...\" Tears were in Peter's eyes. \"What's wrong?\" Thomas asked. \"Nothing...I'm glad you're safe, Thomas. So glad. Thank you for everything.\" \"You shouldn't be worrying about my safety, Peter.\" Thomas said, his voice thick. \"It's because of me that you were ever in danger.\" \"No, Thomas. It's all right. If I hadn't gone to the camp, I might never have become a Christian.\" \"You became a Christian?\" Thomas asked in disbelief. \"Yes. And no matter what happens to me, I'm secure in Jesus.\" Peter told his friend, joyfully. \"My soul is safe with Him.\" \"But...\" Thomas protested. \"A Christian? Peter, did you have to pick such an extreme religion?\" \"It's not a religion, Thomas.\" Peter shook his head. \"It's a faith--my faith.\" \"Oh, Peter. They brainwashed you!\" \"Do you think the Nazis are Christians?\" \"Well, the Christians are against Jews, aren't they?\" \"No!\" Peter shook his head in frustration. \"Christianity is rooted in Judaism. I was saved through a man in the camp, a Christian who hid Jews in his home for the past six years. He is holding onto life only to tell as many people he can about the truth. Otherwise, he would surrender and let Jesus take him home to Heaven.\" \"Oh.\" Thomas felt very small. \"Nazis aren't Christians. Christians love one another, and they even love their enemies. That would definitely rule out the Nazis as Christians.\" \"So why are you a Christian?\" \"I believe that Jesus Christ came to earth in human form to save lost souls. He is our Salvation and Savior.\" \"Who else believes this nonsense?\" Thomas asked. \"I do.\" Helga spoke for the first time since they had entered the room. \"Peter led me to Christ not two days ago.\" \"Thomas, make the choice to follow Christ.\" Peter urged. \"The man who led me to Christ, Johann, told me about a Bible verse that says if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord, and believe in our hearts that God raised Him from the dead, we will be saved. The Bible is God's letter to his children, those who believe on his name.\" \"So all I need to do is believe?\" \"That's all, Thomas. And you will be a new creation in Jesus.\" \"How do I confess with my mouth?\" \"Speak directly to Him. He will listen.\" \"God, I believe that Jesus is Lord, and that he died and that You raised him from the dead, and I believe he will take me to Heaven when I die someday.\" Thomas prayed. He was immediately filled with a peace he'd never known before. It felt so comforting. It didn't last long, though. There was pounding at the door. The police were there, and they arrested Thomas, Peter, and Helga. All three were imprisoned at Neuemgamme, along with Evey. The foursome were to stand trial, due to Peter and Evey's stepfathers' standing. There wasn't much time, but all three Christians in the small group spoke to Evey every chance they got, and the day before the trial, Evey accepted Jesus as her Savior. The trial was short, and not entirely fair. It resulted in the death of Peter, Thomas, and Helga, and the imprisonment of Evey. Evey lived through the war, and eventually emigrated to America, where she was welcomed into the tight-knit community of Chester County, Pennsylvania. Evey enjoyed visiting the county libraries, where she spoke about her concentration camp experience, about her salvation, and about her first love, Peter Muller. Thanks so much for reading!

Chapter 1: It was a chilly autumn Wednesday afternoon on the month of November and the Monstars were in the gym where it was nice and warm. Pound and Blanko were playing some basketball, Nawt was running on the treadmill, Bang was lifting some weights, and Bupkus was on a stationary bike. It was just an ordinary day at the gym until, Pound called out his crew. \"Team meeting!\" When the four Monstars heard his call, they walked to bleachers and sat down. \"Alright everybody! It's the day before Thanksgiving so we're heading to the store to buy a lot of great things to eat.\" Pound told his team. \"Awesome! I love me some turkey!\" Bupkus said with a satisfied smile rubbing his belly. \"Me too dude! I can already taste those meals right now.\"Blanko agreed. \"Pumpkin pie here I come!\" exclaimed Nawt. \"Don't forget the cranberry sauce.\" Bang reminded. Pound smiled to see all of his friends excited for the big day. \"Nice to see you boys excited. Now let's head to store, I already got the turkey yesterday so we don't have to worry about them being sold out.\" The boys put on their coats, hats and headed outside. After Pound locks the gym doors shut, the five Monstars went into their car and drove to the store. The gang arrived at the shopping center parking lot and went into the grocery store. The gang gathered lots of goodies in the cart such as mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, bread rolls, corn, yams, and a lot more until their cart was nearly full. Pound maneuvered the shopping cart towards the meat section, their final destination while the rest of the team followed him. Pound reached for the honey-baked ham when suddenly, Pound's hand bumped into someone's tan brown hand. Him and the stranger apologized to each other, \"I'm sorry.\" When Pound looked at the stranger, he was mesmerized. The stranger was just a beautiful tan-skinned lady with long black hair, and brown eyes. She was wearing a pink sweater, long blue jeans, red sneakers, and emerald earrings. The two of them gazed into each other's eyes and smiled. Both of them said \"hello\" to each other and introduced themselves. \"Hi. My name is Pound.\" He said. \"Nice to meet you. My name is Gretchen, Gretchen Deville.\" She said. \"You have a cute name. I like it.\" Pound said in a deep,attractive voice. Gretchen smiled and blushed at Pound's compliment, \"Aww why thank you. You're so sweet.\" The two of them shook hands until Gretchen noticed the four Monstars were smiling at her. \"Those guys' friends of yours?\" Gretchen asked. Pound turned around and replied, \"Yes\". He cleared his throat then introduces his friends to her. \"Gretchen I would like you to meet my friends Bupkus, Bang, Blanko, and Nawt.\" Pound continued, \"Fellas, this is Gretchen.\" Gretchen smiled as she waved to the boys. \"Nice to meet you guys.\" The boys talked to Gretchen for a while as they started to like her and got to know her better; until she had to go. \"It's been nice knowing you all but I have to go. You guys can have the ham.\" Gretchen headed to the self-checkout and after she was done, she put her groceries in the paper bags when suddenly, Pound called her name. \"Hey Gretchen!\" She turned around when she heard his voice. \"What is it Pound?\" she asked. Pound walked to her and said, \"I was wondering if you're not too busy tomorrow, maybe you can come over to our house for Thanksgiving dinner.\" Gretchen thought about it for a bit and liked the idea. \"Sure! Maybe I can meet you guys at 3:30 PM tomorrow. Sounds good?\" she asked. \"Yes, I would love that!\" Pound smiled with glee. Gretchen gave Pound her phone number and Pound gave Gretchen his phone number. \"Alright, I'll see you tomorrow Pound and I'll call you later.\" she told him. \"Same here!\" Pound said. Gretchen waved him goodbye as she heads out of the store. Pound smiled dreamily as he walked back to the team with his eyes shaped like hearts, his face being red as a tomato, and his heart beating really fast.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Pound snapped out of it when he noticed his team was giving him big smiles. \"Why are you guys looking at me like that?\" he shrugged. Bang raised a brow, \"You know why Romeo.\" Nawt cuts in, \"You got a crush on Gretchen.\" Pound folded his arms and scoffed, \"What? No I don't.\" The four Monstars raised their eyebrows at him, \"Sure you don't.\" Pound growled at them, \"What does that supposed to mean?\" Bang answered, \"It's means that you're lying. You do like her.\" Pound was being stubborn about his feelings,\"Ok that proves nothing.\" Bupkus said, \"Pound, you were making googly eyes at her.\" Blanko adds in, \"And when you walked back here your eyes were shaped like hearts and your face was red as a tomato.\" Finally, Pound admits it, \"Alright fine! I do have a crush on her! Happy now?\" Bupkus tries to calm him down after he felt tense. \"Whoa man chill! We're not making fun of you for liking her. We're just happy that you invited her over for dinner tomorrow that's all.\" Blanko said, \"Bupkus is right. You can't deny true love and besides, she's really nice. I'm sure she'll be lucky to have you as a boyfriend in the future.\" Pound smiled, \"Thanks Blanko! And you guys are right, I shouldn't be afraid to tell her how I feel.\" Pound and the others noticed it was getting late so they headed to self checkout to pay for the food and put their groceries into paper bags. In their car, they drove home with a trunk filled with lots of good things to eat for tomorrow's feast. Meanwhile at night in the Monstars' house, after they put away all the groceries from the trunk of their car, they were having roasted honey barbecue chicken legs with a side of fries for dinner in the dining room. Then the boys started talking about Gretchen. \"Man, Gretchen seemed like a nice girl back at the store.\" Bupkus said smiling. The gang agreed by nodding their heads. \"She's also kinda cute too. \" Blanko said. While Pound was eating his chicken leg and fries, he noticed his team looking at him with big smiles on their faces. \"What is it now?\" he whined. \"We were just wondering, what do you like about Gretchen?\" Nawt asked. Pound rested his head on his left hand and thought about what he liked about her, \"Well I do like her long hair, lips, and smile.\" He continued dreamily, \"But what I love most about her is those deep,chocolaty eyes.\" The four boys looked at each other and sensed that Pound was crazy about Gretchen. \"Man, you really love Gretchen do you?\" Bang asked. Pound flushed, \"Yes. That's why I invited her to come over here for Thanksgiving dinner.\" Blanko walks over to Pound and puts his hand on his shoulder, \"It's okay dude. Like we said, you falling in love with Gretchen is nothing to be ashamed of. We all like her and we thought that you inviting her over for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow was the best idea you came up with. I think you should be happy for falling in love with her. She's awesome and so are you Pound.\" Bupkus agreed, \"I agree with Blanko. We know you'll impress her.\" Nawt cheered for him \"We believe in you man!\" Bang said to Pound, \"You can do it man!\" Pound smiled at what the boys said, \"Thanks for the pep talk you guys.\" Him and the others got out of their seats and gathered around for a group hug. Later on when the Monstars finished eating, they carried and cleaned their plates in the sink and put them back in the cabinet. Pound looked at the kitchen clock and said \"Alright everybody, let's brush our teeth, head upstairs and into bed. We got a big day tomorrow!\" The Monstars brushed their teeth in the bathroom, went upstairs to put on their pajamas in their rooms, and headed straight to bed.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The next morning in the kitchen, after the Monstars ate breakfast Pound grabbed all the food and cooking supplies and puts them on the kitchen counter for their big Thanksgiving feast until Bupkus and the others walked towards him. Pound turned around and responded, \"Hey guys, what's up?\" Bupkus asked,\"Pound, can I ask you something?\" Pound replied, \"Sure, I'm listening.\" Bupkus tells him about his idea. \"I was thinking, maybe instead of you preparing dinner for our lovely guest, we could prepare dinner for you and I could be the host.\" Pound felt unsure about the idea, \"I don't know Bupkus, are you sure? Because being the host requires a lot of responsibility.\" Then Nawt tries to reason with him, \"Oh come Pound, I'm sure we'll do fine preparing dinner for you and your gal and I'm sure Bupkus will do fine keeping an eye on us while we're fixing dinner.\" Pound still felt unsure. \" I agree with Nawt. We want to help you make a good impression on Gretchen. And what better way to do that than to help you prepare dinner?.\" Blanko agreed. \"If these guys want to be on board with this, then I want to be on board too Pound.\" Bang said determinedly.\" Bupkus continues to convince Pound. \"See Pound? Everyone here wants to be on board by helping you prepare dinner for Gretchen so you can make your move on her and win her heart. Even me. So what do you say? Will you let us help you?\" Pound thought about what Bupkus and the others said for a bit. He accepted the offer and the two of them shook hands. \"Alright Bupkus, I'll let you be in charge of the preparations and I'll let the rest of you guys be in charge of setting the table and cooking the food.\" The rest of the Monstars smile at Pound after accepting Bupkus' offer. \"Thanks Pound! I'm telling you that this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever!\" Bupkus said with excitement. \"Don't worry dude! Leave everything to us.\" Blanko said. \"Thanks. You guys are the best.\" Pound said smiling. Bang, Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt smiled back at him. \"Well guys, we better head into our rooms, get dressed, and get ready for this afternoon. \"I'll call Gretchen and ask her if I can pick her up at her place.\" The five Monstars went upstairs into their rooms and got dressed into their tuxedos. After Pound got dressed, he looked at the paper with Gretchen's phone number on it on his dresser. He toughened up and thought to himself. \"My friends are right. I shouldn't be afraid to tell Gretchen how I feel.\" He walked to the dresser and picked up the paper with her phone number on it. While looking at the digits, he brought up his cell phone and dialed the number. Finally, Gretchen answered. \"Hello? Pound: Hey Gretchen! It's me Pound! Gretchen: Hey Pound. How's it going? Pound: I was wondering if I can pick you up at your place and drop you off at our place. Gretchen: Sounds very sweet of you. I'll be waiting for you outside my house. Pound smiled with joy over the phone and got back to Gretchen. Pound: Ok! I'll meet you there. Bye. As Pound hung up his cell phone. He smiled dreamily while his face turned red and hearts circling around his head. (Sorry about the long delay. I was busy with schoolwork I forgot. Even though Thanksgiving is over, that doesn't stop me from finishing this story. )[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Pound and the boys walked out of their rooms wearing their tuxedos. Nawt asked, \"So Pound. How did the talk between you and Gretchen go on your cellphone?\" Pound responded, \"It went pretty good. She said she would love for me to come over at her place to pick her up. I even got her address she sent me for my GPS app.\" Bang gave him a thumbs up. \"Thanks good to hear man.\" Pound smiled at Bang. \"Thanks.\" Pound walked to Bang and gave each other a fist bump. After the five Monstars went downstairs, Pound was heading to the front door. Before he opened the door, he looked at his team to say something to them. \"Guys, when I come back here with Gretchen, I want everything set up in the dining room for Thanksgiving.\" He told the boys. \"Right.\" The four of them replied. Pound looked at Bupkus and said, \"Oh and Bupkus, make sure you keep an eye on the boys.\" \"Don't worry Pound. I'll take it from here.\" Bupkus responded proudly. Pound continued, \"Okay then. I'm counting on all of you.\" As Pound opens and closes the front door of the mansion, he heads to his car and drives out of the driveway. After Pound left to pick up Gretchen at her house, Bupkus gave orders to Bang,Blanko,and Nawt like a true host. \"Alright everybody listen up! Here's how we're going to set up dinner. Blanko and Nawt, I want you two set up the table. \"Alright Nawt, let's do this.\" Blanko said eagerly. Nawt replied, \"I'm with you Blanko.\" The two Monstars smiled and gave each other high-fives. Bupkus continued to give out orders. \"Bang, you can be in charge with the meals.\" Bang responded, \"Sure, I can do that. Piece of cake.\" After Bupkus assigned the three Monstars with each job, they were ready to set up everything for Thanksgiving dinner. Bupkus told them, \"Alright boys! Let's do this. For Pound!\" \"For Pound!\" The three of them said. While the four of them were back home preparing dinner. Pound was on his way to pick up Gretchen at her house. While driving he thought to himself, \"Alright Pound. This is your moment to shine.\" You're going to pick up the woman of your dreams and win her heart. Nothing to be nervous about.\" Finally, Pound made it to Gretchen house located on Harewood Drive like the GPS said and parked into her driveway. Pound got out of the car and went up to Gretchen's front porch. When he rung the doorbell, he waited for her. When Gretchen opened her door Pound couldn't believe his eyes. Gretchen was wearing a red dress with pink lipstick, pearl earrings, and pink shoes with heels. Pound melted at what he had saw and Gretchen noticed how weird he was looking at her. \"Pound, are you feeling ok?\" she asked. He snapped out of it and responded, \"Yeah, I'm feeling ok Gretchen. It's just that you look amazing.\" Pound slowly grabbed Gretchen's hand and kissed it. She smiled and replied, \"Thanks. I think you look amazing too.\" After Gretchen locks her front door shut, she and Pound held each other's hands as they got to his car. Pound opened the right door in the front of the car for Gretchen and closed it. When Pound got into his car, he started the engine and drove out of Gretchen's driveway to head back to the mansion.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Meanwhile back at the Monstars' mansion, Bupkus was checking on Bang,Blanko,and Nawt to make sure that everything is running smoothly for Thanksgiving dinner for Pound and Gretchen. First Bupkus checked on Bang in the kitchen while he was looking after the turkey while wearing his chef's hat and apron. \"Hey Bang. How are the meals coming along?\" As Bang showed Bupkus all things he made for dinner, he replied,\"The meals are coming along great. I made homemade mac and cheese,mashed potatoes, yams and strawberry shortcake for dessert. I'm also heating up some stuffing, corn on the cobs, and some spinach too. I even made some cheesy fried green tomatoes as appetizers and strawberry shortcake for dessert. The turkey will be ready soon.\"Bupkus smiled and said, \"Nice! All these meals look good enough to eat.\" Then Bupkus went to check on Blanko and Nawt in the dining room while the two of them were setting the table. \"Hey Blanko and Nawt. How's the table looking?\" Nawt went first and said, \"Table's all set Bupkus. Blanko and I also set up the plates, utensils, glass cups, and napkins.\" Then Blanko said, \"Man, I can't wait to see look on Pound and Gretchen's faces once they see our presentation.\" Bupkus agreed with the two boys.\"Me too you guys. The lovely couple should be on their way.\" While Pound and Gretchen were riding the car on their way to the Monstars' mansion,Gretchen couldn't wait to dinner with Pound and his aliens friends. \"Man Pound. I can't wait to have dinner to with your friends.\" she said eagerly. Pound smiled and said, \"Me too.\" Finally, they arrived at the mansion and Pound drove the car to the driveway. When they got out of the car, Gretchen couldn't believe that Pound and his team live in a mansion. She exclaimed, \"Wow Pound! You guys live in this mansion?!\" Pound nodded his head and replied, \"We sure do. Do you like it?\" Gretchen answered, \"Like it? I love it!\" Pound smiled at Gretchen's words, \"I'm glad you like it.\" Pound unlocks the front door with his house keys and opens the door. When Pound and his lovely guest walked inside the mansion after closing the door, Gretchen was amazed how big the inside of the Monstars' home was. \"Whoa! This place is huge!\" Gretchen exclaimed. Pound replied, \"It sure is.\" Then Pound called out to his team, \"Boys! I'm back with Gretchen!\" As Bupkus and the others heard their orange leader had arrived with the lovely guest, Bupkus told the others, \"Alright men! Let's show Gretchen a good time and help Pound win her heart!\" \"Right!\" They all replied. As Bupkus,Bang,Blanko,and Nawt walked towards Pound with his love interest near their front door, the four Monstars were shocked at how beautiful Gretchen looked in her dress. Bupkus complimented her in a deep, sensible tone, \"You look beautiful today Gretchen.\" Bang agreed with Bupkus, \"Amazing indeed.\" Then Nawt added, \"Pretty.\" \"You look amazing dudette!\" Blanko smiled. Gretchen smiled and blushed at their kind words as she looked at the boys in their tuxedos. \"Aww, thank you boys.I think all of you look handsome in your tuxedos.\" The Monstars felt bashful at what Gretchen said to them. \"Thanks.\" They all said. \"Oh Gretchen. I almost forgot to tell that Bupkus is the host for this Thanksgiving dinner.\" Pound mentions to Gretchen. Bupkus responded, \"I sure am. Dinner will be ready soon, so why don't you two wait in the living room?\" Bupkus leans over to Pound and nudged him on the arm as he winked and smiled at him. \"Okay. Come on Gretchen.\" Pound rolled his eyes. As he stopped and turned around to look at his friends, they gave him big smiles and thumbs up. Pound smiled back and turned around to head to the living room where Gretchen is.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Bupkus, Bang, Blanko, and Nawt went back to the kitchen to set up dinner while Pound and Gretchen were sitting next to each other on the couch in the living room while waiting for their dinner. Gretchen went first and told Pound, \"Man Pound, it's really nice of your friends to make and prepare dinner for us.\" Pound chuckled and replied, \"You can say that again. Those guys are like brothers to me.\"Gretchen smiled and said, \"Yeah, I really like them too.\" The lovely couple smiled at each other and started talking to each other. An hour later, Pound and Gretchen were having a good time. \"You know Pound, I really love talking to you.\" said Gretchen, \"You're a very good listener.\" Pound blushed and replied, \"Thanks Gretchen.\" Finally, Pound straightens himself up and gulped as he was ready to express his feelings to her. \"Gretchen, there's something I want to tell you.\" he said. Gretchen asked, \"What is it Pound?\" Pound replied, \"When I first met you at the grocery store yesterday I saw how amazing you look. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever met and it was really nice for my friends and I to get a chance to know you better.\" Gretchen was touched by Pound's words. \"Why thank Pound, I'm flattered.\" she said, \"I thought it was really nice meeting you and your friends too. To be honest, I think you have the most amazing features I ever seen. \" Pound raised his eyebrow and said. \"Really? Tell me what you like about me.\" Gretchen took a good look at Pound and swooned, \"Well, you're really nice, charming, and I love the sound of your voice. It's so deep and handsome.\" Pound wiggled his eyebrows and responded in a deeper, attractive voice, \"Oh really? I can make my voice deeper if you like.\" Gretchen blushed and giggled, \"Oh stop it Pound, you're making me blush.\" Pound and Gretchen chuckled for a bit and straighten themselves up. \"Listen Gretchen,I also have another thing to tell you.\" said Pound as he touches her hand, \"The truth is, I love you. Ever since my friends and I met you at the grocery store I started to develop a crush on you and I wanted to wait for the right moment to express my feelings for you because you're the most beautiful girl I met.\" Gretchen smiled when Pound expressed his love to her. \"Pound, that's the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.\" she said as she gazes into Pound's eyes, \"I felt the exact same way when I met you and your friends. I love you too.\" Pound and smiled and gave each other a big hug. After Pound and Gretchen finished hugging, they closed their eyes and slowly kissed each other on the lips.[Chapter 7] Chapter:7 Suddenly after Pound and Gretchen stopped kissing, they were startled when the two of them saw Bupkus, Blanko, Bang, and Nawt walked into the living room and said, \"Awww.\" Pound and Gretchen blushed and showed embarrassing smiles on their faces as they got off the couch. Pound asked, \"How much did you guys hear?\" The four them smiled and replied, \"Everything.\" The two lovely couple chuckled for a bit until all of a sudden, there was a loud grumbling sound coming from Pound's stomach. \"I don't know about you guys but I'm getting kinda hungry.\" \"Me too\" said Gretchen. Bupkus replied, \"Well Gretchen, you and Pound are in luck. After he left the mansion to pick you up, the four of us worked together to set up a big and delicious Thanksgiving dinner for all of us.\" \"We even worked together to set up the dining room table.\" said Blanko. \"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's eat!\" said Nawt. When the four Monstars walked into the dining room, Pound and Gretchen held their hands together and went to the dining room with the others. When they made it to the dining room, Pound and Gretchen were amazed at the delicious foods they set up for dinner on the dining room table such as turkey,stuffing,homemade mac and cheese,mashed potatoes,yams,spinach,cheesy fried green tomatoes,corn on the cobs and strawberry shortcake for dessert. \"Oh Pound,I'm impressed!\" said Gretchen. \"So am I.\" Pound replied, \"Great job you guys!\" \"Thanks!\" The Monstars replied.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Pound, Gretchen, and the rest of the Monstars sat down at the dining room table with food on their plates and glass cups filled with apple cider. Before they started eating their meal, they all held each other's hands while Pound started saying his grace. \"Dear lord, thank you for this wonderful food and for letting us all be here together on Thanksgiving.\" \"Amen.\" They all said. \"Alright everyone, let's eat.\" said Pound. So the Monstars and Gretchen grabbed their silverware and started to eat their Thanksgiving dinner. They ate fried green tomatoes as appetizers; turkey legs, homemade macaroni and cheese,yams,spinach,mashed potatoes,stuffing,bread rolls, and cranberry sauce as the main course; a slice strawberry shortcake for dessert; and drank apple cider. After Pound, Gretchen, and the rest of the Monstars finished eating, they were all exhausted after eating their dinner. \"Dudes, I'm stuffed.\" Blanko groaned. \"You're not the only one.\" Bupkus replied.\"Man you guys, I don't think I can eat another bite.\" Nawt moaned. \"Boys, I couldn't agree more.\" said Pound. Suddenly, he let out a huge burp which surprises Gretchen and the rest of the Monstars. Pound blushed and chuckled embarrassingly. \"Whoops, excuse me.\" he said. Gretchen replied, \"It's cool. Besides, the food was delicious.\" \"You should thank Bang.\" Bupkus suggested, \"He was the one who cooked the food.\" \"Well in that case, thank you for the food Bang.\" said Gretchen, \"I think you're an amazing cook.\" Bang smiled at her complement. \"Thanks Gretchen. I'm glad you liked the food.\" \"Alright everyone, now that we finished our dinner, what do you guys say we clean our dishes the together?\" Pound suggested. Gretchen and the rest of the Monstars liked the idea, so after everyone puts the rest of the food in their refrigerator for leftovers, they grabbed their plates off the table and got out of their seats to head to the kitchen to wash their dishes in the sink.

It is an honor to be chosen for the first airbornenassault on Great Britain, remember that. You will report silentlynand promptly after dinner. Dismissed. Heil Hitler! \" Thomas echoed thenNazi salute, but there was no feeling in it. Of all places, he hadnto end up here. Hitler, in order to step up the advance, had orderednall HJs of seventeen or older into the armed forces. Only an elitengroup was admitted to the Luftwaffe , although many work campndetainees had been sent too. The mortality rate was expected to benhigh in any direct attack on Britain. At least the first one wouldnhave the advantage of surprise. After this, I'll find a way tondisappear , he thought. If I survive. It took awhile tonget through the crowd, but at last Thomas made it to the list ofnassignments. With him would be Emil, some pilot named HoritznSchuler…and Peter. As if on cue,nsomeone softly started whistling \"It Don't Mean a Thing.\" Thomas spun around. \" You! You're here …\" Peter'snface was unreadable. \"Hello, Thomas.\" It had only been for twonmonths, but his face was paler, more gaunt from living in a workncamp. Then he'd been forced to enter training for the upcomingnmission. Thomasndidn't know what to say. The last time they'd been face to face,nhe'd nearly killed his best friend. Did Peter resent him for it? \"You'rennot a murderer, Thomas.\" \"I know who my friends are.\" Somethingnhad happened that night outside the Bismarck. Ever since, Thomas hadnfelt disgusted at what he'd said, what he'd become. He wantednout. Now it seemed he was as much a prisoner as Peter was. Peternsaw the haunted look in his friend's eyes. The Thomas he knew wasnstill in there, fighting the cage the Nazis had put him in. \" It'snokay, I don't need to hear it.\" \" No,nI really need to say it. I was such a—\" \" Forgetnit,\" said Peter. He was smiling in a way he hadn't for a longntime. \"That's all behind us now. And anyway, if we're gonnandie prisoners, at least we'll eat better here.\" Thomasncouldn't help but grin back, his old, cocky grin. \" So,nit's back to keeping an eye on you two.\" Emilnstrode up, hands held casually in the small of his back. \"Especiallynyou, Müller. Such a waste, to be caught at a swing club.\" Thomasnthrew Emil a dirty look, but luckily it went unnoticed. \"Save thenlectures for the flight, Emil. Let's get some food while theynstill got some.\" Theynheaded for the mess hall, Thomas feeling lighter than he had innmonths. Maybe he hadn't lost everything after all. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Dear Emma, Sonfar we've seen little action, but there are rumors that Germany isnplanning to attack Britain directly. How, I'm not sure. I hopenthis letter finds you safe and whole; it is the reason I chose tonfight in this war. God's purpose will come out in the end, as Dadnwould say. Someday he'll understand. Pray for the war effort, andnkeep your nose clean for me. Yournloving brother, Ben - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \" Innthe wake of the bombing, Londoners remain shaken but undeterred. Volunteers spent the night battling fires throughout the city. Nownthe search continues for survivors in the worst of the damage. Several Nazi planes were shot down, but so far no enemy has beennfound alive. Meanwhile…\" \"EmmalinenAnne, come to breakfast. You've wasted enough time in front ofnthat machine.\" Inrolled my eyes and stood up. Dad hated newfangled inventions inngeneral. The only reason we had a radio was because I convinced himnof the need when Ben enlisted. My brother was four years older thannme, but we'd been really close since Mum died. I followed everynscrap of war news I could find. Dad gave me a cross look when Infinally sat down. \"Inhope your radio told you that school is still on and you'd betternhurry up,\" he said sternly. He wore his vicar's collar evennthough he didn't have to work today. \"What?!\" \"Younheard me,\" he said in his no-nonsense voice. \"They called aboutntwenty minutes ago. You'll have to go through the park; there'snan unexploded bomb in the middle of Ash Street.\" Inwolfed down my sausage and eggs, and then dashed upstairs to get mynschoolbag and shoes. Good thing I dressed in my school uniformnout of habit . My curly brown hair, cut above my shoulders, wasnas unruly as ever, but that couldn't be helped now. \"Bye,nDad!\" Thenpark was spookily quiet, deserted because of the time of day and thenbombing. Right in the center was a plane crumpled on the groundnbehind the trees. I was nearly level with it before I caught anglimpse of the black swastika on the tail. A figure was stillnslumped in the blood-spattered cockpit. Inhad to swallow a scream and a wave of nausea as I broke into a run. German or not, that was a human being who had met a sudden andnviolent death. Somewhere, far away, a worried family had just lost anson. \"Emma,nare you alright?\" Notnlooking where I was going, I nearly ran headlong into my best friend,nCatharine Hemler. \"You're crying !\" Indid, indeed, have tears streaming down my face. Catharine handed mena hankie and guided me to the nearest bathroom. It was a few minutesnbefore I could calm down enough to talk. \"Therenw-was an unexploded bomb on Ash Street, so I had to go th-through thenpark. I saw a c-crashed plane with a G-German inside. He was d-dead. It was awful!\" Catharinenclapped a hand to her mouth, then hugged me tightly. Her family hadnfled the worsening condition in Germany when she was only five, sonshe still felt some connection. But they supported the Allies asnmuch as any Briton. \"I'mnsorry you had to see that,\" she said, trying to comfort me. \"Nonone should have to see such times.\" \"Whyndo people feel they have to attack and kill to accomplish things?\" \"Godngave mankind free will. Some people choose the path of the devil.\" Catharine also went to our church. \"At least that's what yourndad would say.\" Goodnold Catharine. She never failed to make me smile. \"Nownwash your face, and we'll go to class.\" Ingiggled. \"Now you sound like my mum.\" Wenboth giggled all the way to class. Catharine told me about how hernlittle brother, Hans, had gone out as soon as the all-clear soundednto look for souvenirs of the attack. \"Everyone'snon the treasure hunt for whatever they can lay their hands on,\" shenfinished. \"I picked up a bullet casing on the way to school, but Inwouldn't go looking for them.\" Inshuddered. The thought of someone poking around the ruins of planesnand buildings for souvenirs was creepy. Thenday passed slowly. The memory of the park kept resurfacing, sonCatharine had to keep distracting me. By afternoon she was startingnto worry. \"Maybenwe should skip your lesson for today.\" \"No!\" Catharine had secretly been teaching me German, a subject I foundnquite intriguing despite the war. \"You'renclearly still in shock. Mama can drive you home, where you can havena nice cup of tea and a nap. That always makes me feel better.\" \"Please,nthe last thing I need is more breaks in routine. Anyway, I actuallyngot to practice this week while Dad was at a meeting. I just neednsomething I really enjoy to take my mind off things.\" \"Maybenwe'll be able to go swing dancing later.\" Swingndancing! There was nothing I loved more than those electrifyingnnights at the dance hall. Dad disapproved of the whole business,nlike that ever stopped me. Ben used to take me all the time beforenhe left. Butnthe dance halls were closed. As days turned into weeks and months,nthe German Luftwaffe continued to pound London to rubble eachnnight. My life became a blur of blackouts, safety procedures, andnnights in the bomb shelter. Many of our valuables had been moved toneither the shelter or the basement. Onennight, as we were crossing the back yard, a plane crashed so close wencould feel the blast of wind it created. I wanted to stop and look,nbut Dad pulled me through the door.[Chapter 2] Finally the bombings slacked off, at least in our part of the city Finallynthe bombings slacked off, at least in our part of the city. Thenschool had been hit a couple of weeks before, but most of thenchildren had already been evacuated out of the city. Catharine andnHans were among them. I simply refused to leave Dad all alone. \"Inpromised your mother I'd take care of you!\" said Dad in one ofnour many arguments. \"What a success I've been. You risk yournsafety in a city under attack, and Ben's run off to be in the thicknof it. What am I to do with such children?\" \"Inwant to help! And I'm not a child, I just turned sixteen!\" Innthe end I won him over. School was replaced with nurse's training,nand I put all my energy into it. Helping others made me feel like Inwas helping the cause. Thenncame a rare day when I was let off duty early. I passed the planenI'd watched fall so many nights before. The sight was no longernshocking, just another part of life. This one in particular had beenncushioned by trees, so it wasn't so badly bent up. Suddenlynthe wind blew my nurse's hat off. It bounced along the groundnbefore disappearing into a nearby house. The building had luckilynbeen empty when a bomb took a large portion out of the yard andnliving room. It looked rather dark and unsafe. Nothingnwill be in there , I told myself, except your hat . It wasnhard to pick my way through the shadows and rubble. I found my hatnand quickly turned to leave. Strongnarms grabbed me from behind, and a voice spoke in my ear that made mynblood run cold. It was German . Mynmind raced through my feeble vocabulary. What do you say to a Nazintrapped in hostile territory? \" Nein! \"nI managed to squeak out. \" Ich —uh— freund , Inthink.\" The arms let go of me. \" SprechennSie Deutsch? Wie kommen Sie hier? \" \"Wait, nein, gulp British,\" I said, very scared. Silencenreigned. I ventured to turn slowly around, hands in plain sight. Thensoldier who walked out of the shadows was, at most, the same age asnBen. Only his hazel eyes, half-hidden by light brown hair, betrayednapprehension. \"You…younwill be more comfortable with English?\" he asked. Inwas dumbfounded. \"You speak English?\" \" Ja . I studied for several years.\" His accent wasn't bad, I noted. He spotted my hat and bag. \"You are a nurse?\" \"Yes,\"nI replied, confused. \"Thennmaybe you can help. You will follow me? I will not hurt you.\" Thensoldier led me through the dark, rubble-strewn space to a roomnfurther in. One lamp was functional. Ansecond soldier lay close to the lamp. His left thigh was bound up inna haphazard field bandage, and he was asleep. I hoped. My heart wasnpounding. \"PeternMüller, my best friend,\" said the first soldier. \"He was hit bynshrapnel just before we went down. The pilot was already dead, andnthe fourth crew died in the crash.\" Mixed feelings showed on hisnface. \"I'mnsorry,\" I murmured. Now that we were talking in a more civilizednmanner, he didn't seem so frightening. But first things first. Inknelt down next to Peter and undid the bandage. The shrapnel wasn'tntoo big, neither was the damage. After giving him a dose ofnmorphine, I felt confident that we wouldn't be discovered. Thenministrations went smoothly for being on my own. \"Henwill be okay?\" asked the first soldier. \"Inthink so. For now, at least. It's gotten infected. I'll havento get antibiotics.\" \"AndnI'll see you again?\" Inblushed. Somehow this was not how I'd pictured a Nazi to be likenat all. \"I suppose so.\" \"Mynname is Thomas, by the way. Thomas Berger.\" \"Emmaline—Inmean, Emma—Reynolds.\" \"Emma,\"nThomas repeated. \"I like it.\" Peternstirred. Thomas put a hand on his shoulder and spoke quietly innGerman. I saw for the first time that every Nazi insignia had beenntorn off their uniforms, even though they were still obviouslynGerman. Swastika-marked knives lay only just within reach. \"You'rennot really one of them, are you?\" \"What?\" \"Nazis.\" Thomasnlooked suddenly troubled. \"I was. Peter knew they were wrong, butnI soaked up every word they said. He was caught when we raided thenBismarck one night. I nearly killed him, with my own hands. \"Afternthat night I wanted out, wanted nothing more to do with the Nazis ornthe HJ. Then Hitler ordered everyone seventeen or older to move upninto the armed forces. I was one of the few admitted to the Luftwaffe directly. Peter was forced in with other prisonersnfrom the work camps. They were trained, yes, but not many werenexpected to survive these missions anyway.\" Thomas' hardnexterior was crumbling. \"I have done so many terrible things.\" Infound myself comforting, even hugging this broken man. A Britishncivilian hugging a German soldier. His story sounded so close tonsome of Ben's recent letters. \" Todaynwe had to fight man-to-man in the streets of a ruined village. Mynbayonet caught a Jerry in the stomach, and I watched him die beforenmy eyes. I'm so ashamed, Emma. Is this what must be done tonachieve peace? I saw the bodies of soldiers who were no more thannkids. Kids! Sixteen or seventeen, upholding the cause of a madman…\" Inwas crying. Crying not just for my country, but for every wretchednsoul trapped in this awful conflict. \"Arenyou going to turn me in?\" Caughtnunawares, I jumped before looking at Thomas. He held up his hands asnif expecting to be handcuffed. I stared at them. A reckless daringnseized my thoughts. \"No,nI'm going to keep you safe,\" I said quietly. Thomas helped menrepack my nurse's kit. \"My house is only a few doors down, andnDad is out. I can return quickly with a few supplies and a decentnmeal for you. As soon as possible, I'd like to move you to a safernplace.\" Thomasnnodded, and watched the petite girl leave. The further he got intonthis conflict, the more people took him by surprise. She was hidingnthem, like so many people at home tried to hide Jews. \"Cannwe trust her?\" asked Peter. He painfully tried to sit up. \"Indon't think we have much choice,\" Thomas replied. \"But she'sndifferent. Instead of handing us over to the authorities, she'snrisking everything to treat us like friends.\" Henfelt another pang of guilt, but this time it didn't seem sonoverwhelming. Could something as trivial as a hug make such andifference? \"Sonthen I told him he was a jerk, and that a concussion resulting fromnwatching the planes instead of his feet could hardly be considered anwar wound,\" I finished with a giggle. We were having a sort ofnpicnic in the abandoned house. Thomasnlaughed out loud. \"I guess everyone meets a few of those in theirnlifetime. What was it he wanted from you again?\" \"Henwas trying to ask me out on a date,\" I replied. \"Unfortunately,nseveral of my friends had also been angels he'd woken up to. Itnwould be several weeks before he could take a girl out anyway.\" Peternasked something in German. He knew very little of English, and bothnThomas and I had proven hopeless at teaching. I made a mental notento introduce Catharine as soon as she returned. \"Well,nwe both agree that you must be an angel,\" said Thomas, switchingnabruptly back to English. His fluency had increased considerably inna short time. \"You're an excellent cook, and probably the onlynBritish citizen who wouldn't have had us shot.\" \"I'mnnot the only one,\" I commented. He didn't know it, but Thomasnhad brought my thoughts back to my brother's most recent letter. Aside from his rant about young soldiers, he'd had an argument withnan officer in his company over the treatment of surrendered enemyntroops. I told Thomas this, and he nodded solemnly. \"Yournbrother has the courage to fight the evil in this world, but he doesnnot kill needlessly,\" the young German said. \"A true soldier.\" \"Thatnletter was from over a month ago now,\" I said glumly. \"Wellnbefore I found you. These long silences worry me.\" Thomasnsaid nothing. I could tell he wanted to, but what could assure ansoldier's safe return? Without really noticing, he put his armnaround my shoulders, and I leaned closer. ThennI heard the whistling. Very softly, someone was whistling \"ItnDon't Mean a Thing.\" I looked at Thomas. He too was lookingnaround curiously. \"Do-wah,ndo-wah, do-wah, do-wah…\" Peternwas leaning against the wall, swinging his makeshift crutch to thenbeat. All three of us started laughing. So that's where he'dnlearned those few English words! \"Comenon,\" said Thomas. He stood up and started to pull me up too. \"ButnI'm not dressed for—\" \"Justna little, then. Nothing too crazy.\" SonPeter sang quietly while Thomas and I danced until we were dizzy. For the first time since the blitz had started, I felt truly happy. Outsidenwas fading to dusk; soon it got chilly. I pulled my sweater close asna breeze whipped through the ruined house. \"Youncan't stay here much longer, you'll catch your deaths!\" \"Wherenelse is there to go?\" Thomas pointed out. Inchewed on my lip for awhile. \"I've got it! Since Dad makes mensleep out in the shelter—with all the air raids—you could stay innthe basement! He never goes down there. Most of the stuff wasnMum's, he can't bear to look at it. It's dark enough now thatnno one will recognize your uniforms, but Dad won't be home yet.\" \"Insuppose so, just a moment.\" Thomas relayed everything in German tonPeter. They discussed it for some time before turning back to me. \"Lead on.\" Wenpacked their meager supplies and, with Thomas supporting Peter, madenit as quickly as could be managed to my house.[Chapter 3] It felt strange to be sneaking into my own house, but I knew we couldn't take many chances Itnfelt strange to be sneaking into my own house, but I knew we couldn'tntake many chances. I was smuggling German soldiers within a countrynat war. Finally, and without incident, however, we made it to thenbasement. \"It'snnot much, but it'll be warm and no one will come nosing down here.\" I poked around one ofnthe boxes while they got settled. Mum's jewelry box sat on top. Memories flooded my mind's eye as I looked through the littlentreasures. Her favorite necklace, a heart pendant set with a singlenstone, had been a gift from Dad because he couldn't afford annengagement ring. I tried it on with trembling fingers. \"Emma?\" Inturned around, startled. Thomas' eyes jumped immediately to thennecklace. \"Thatnis schön . Belonged to…\" \"Mynmum, yes,\" I finished. Thomas stepped close, and placed a handngently on my cheek. \" Dunbist auch schön . Thought so since I first set eyes on you.\" Thenfront door opened and closed, making both of us jump. \"Emma?nI'm home.\" Inran upstairs and shut the door behind me. \"Hi, Dad.\" \"Whynare you wearing that?\" he asked. I realized he was staring atnMum's necklace. \"SometimesnI like to look through her old things,\" I replied, a little coldly. \"When I feel alone.\" \"Putnit away, please,\" he said without looking at me again. Unbidden,nanger flushed my face. \"What if I don't want to? Some of usnprefer to remember her rather than push her away.\" \"Insaid—' \"It'snbeen six years!\" I shouted. \"For six years you've buried hernunder everything and yourself in your work.\" \" God's work! Emmaline, I've raised you better than—\" \" You've raised me? You know nothing about me! Ben and I spent so much timenwith no one but each other for comfort, but now you bury him toonbecause he's nothing like you. Neither am I!\" I spun around,nangry tears blurring my vision. \"Comenback here, young lady! I suppose you expect dinner to just appear,\"nDad yelled after me. \"Therenare leftovers in the refrigerator. I'm not hungry.\" Withoutna backward glance, I stormed back to the basement and locked the doornbehind me. Thomas and Peter let me retreat to the corner where Mum'snbox was and cry for awhile. Only when I started to calm down didnThomas approach. \"Whatnhappened to her?\" he asked quietly, sitting down close to me. Inhiccupped, then took a deep, shuddering breath. \"Mum and Dad hadngone on a trip, just the two of them, and were on their way back. The car was new. They were just outside of town when it stallednpartway across the tracks. Mum thought Dad was joking—then theynheard the whistle. Dad got out to push, while Mum took over thenwheel. The train…crushed the f-front half to pieces.\" New tearsnhad sprung to my eyes. Thomasnstarted to say that was enough, but I waved him off. \"The doctorsnsaid she probably didn't feel anything. Dad still can'tnreconcile himself. For six years Ben and I have all but raisednourselves. Then he left me all alone…\" I felt those strong armsnaround me again, no longer threatening, and couldn't help but sobninto the filthy black uniform. Not even Ben's arms had offerednthis kind of comfort; he said we should be strong for Mum. Faintly,nI heard the air raid sirens going off. Dad pounded on the basementndoor. I looked at Thomas, suddenly afraid for him. \"We'llnbe okay down here,\" he whispered. Already he was moving out of thenline of sight. \"Don't make your father worry.\" Intook one step, then dashed back to Thomas, kissed him lightly on thencheek, and ran up the stairs. Another long night in the bunker. Indon't know how Dad didn't realize something was up. We both hadnresponsibilities: me with my volunteering, him with his duties as anvicar. But I was spending all the free time I had down in thenbasement. Then there was the issue of food. Dad did his fair sharenof the cooking; one would think he'd notice it was going twice asnfast. Nonenof it seemed to matter, though. I had found friends when they shouldnhave been enemies and, more importantly, someone who truly carednabout me again. Peternwas doing better by the day, despite being confined to a tinynbasement. Now he and Thomas took turns dancing with me. ThenRAF was clearly gaining the advantage as the air fights continuedntowards the end of November. I told the boys every bit of news Inheard of the war in continental Europe. And anything else they mightnfind entertaining. \"Intreated an injured pilot today,\" I said as I served tea. Dad wasnout again. \"One of the Americans come to help the RAF. He saidntoday was Thanksgiving in the U.S., and that he wished he could benhome for his mum's pumpkin pie.\" \"Somenof us have a lot to be thankful for,\" said Thomas. Inlooked at him quizzically, \"Well,nfor starters, me and Peter. Our plane crashed in late Septembernbehind enemy lines, yet here we are. Healthy and safe, and beingnkept so by a beautiful and courageous young woman.\" Inblushed. \"Thennthere's you,\" Thomas continued. \"You mentioned before that Bennwas the closest companion you had before he left to fight. Thenseparation deeply affected you. Yet over the past months now you'venlearned to smile and laugh and dance again.\" He ran a hand throughnhis brown hair. \"Maybe even love.\" \"Younseem to have given this a fair bit of thought,\" I said. \"Yes,nit's amazing what one act of kindness can do. Forgiving someone ofna hurt they caused can save a friendship.\" Thomas turned to Peternand said something in German. Peter nodded as he replied. \"Sheltering an enemy unconditionally can show him he's not thenmonster he thought he was.\" Thomas'ngaze locked with mine and held it. \"I've struggled with that forna long time. I confessed so much to you that day, but you comfortednme as a friend. Like a brother. That was all it took.\" Mynmouth was hanging open in wonderment. That simple moment ofncompassion had just come naturally, like I knew it was the rightnthing. I never thought it could turn an entire life around… Someonenwas knocking on the front door. Thomas couldn't help smiling as henwatched Emma disappear from sight. Such traits could mend a war, ifnmore people chose to do so. Thud. Withoutnthinking, Thomas was up the stairs. A man in a British uniform wasngetting back into a car, and Emma was sitting on the floor. She wasnshaking. \"Emma,nwhat happened?\" Inheld one hand to my mouth, a folded piece of paper in the other. \"Ben'snbeen critically injured,\" I whispered. \"And the hospital can'tnevacuate. They don't think he'll survive.\" I've nevernwanted to cry so badly in my life. Thomasnpulled me up and held me tightly. \"I don't know your brother. But if he's anything like you, he'll make sure he survives.\"[Chapter 4] I don't know how long we stood there Indon't know how long we stood there. Nothing else seemed to existnuntil a crash on the porch brought both of us back to reality. Dadnhad dropped the bag of groceries he'd been carrying. Upon drawingncloser to the house, there had been no mistake that Thomas' uniformnwas not British. \"He—you—\"nDad couldn't seem to decide whether to be angry or afraid. \"Younhave to let me explain, Dad,\" I said shakily. Already I wasnbacking into the house, keeping myself between my father and Thomas. \"Explain?!\"nspluttered Dad. He shut the front door behind him. \" He's anNazi! \" \"Nonhe's not!\" I pleaded. \"He doesn't want anything to do withnthem! Thomas and Peter were forced to fly in the air raids, andnsurvived a crash-landing two months ago. I've been helping themnever since.\" \" Helping them?!\" The incredulous look on Dad's face was terrifying. \"Yes! 'If you've helped the least of these, you've helped me,'nremember? I found them injured and without supplies in a bombed-outnhouse. If I hadn't helped them, I couldn't live with myself. Atnleast I learned something from you!\" Dadnlooked too stunned to retort. I heard footsteps, and turned to seenPeter emerging warily from the basement. \"Looknat him, Dad,\" I said more quietly. \"If his hair were a littlenlonger, he could be Ben's double. They're his age or younger…\"nI choked as the words of Ben's letter surfaced in my mind. Finally, the burning tears came. \"Now we might never see Bennagain!\" \"Indon't understand.\" Inhanded Dad the piece of paper. Thomas and Peter were watching withnapprehension. WhennDad looked up, he too was crying. Without a word he walked up andnhugged me like hadn't done in years. \"I'mnso sorry,\" he whispered. \"I'm sorry for everything.\" \"It'snokay, Dad.\" Suddenly I didn't need to hear the emphatic speechnI'd longed for him to say. This moment needed only kindness. Onenact of kindness. Itnwasn't as bad as I thought it would be. After a lot of carefulnexplaining and days of interrogation, the boys were allowed to staynat our house without 24-hour supervision. A couple newspapernreporters showed up, but Dad turned them away. He said the boys hadnbeen through enough. WhennCatharine heard about it, she bombarded me with questions. SoonnPeter was getting more letters than I did—in German, of course. Thenair raids stopped shortly before Christmas; refugees startednreturning not long after that. Families wanted to be reunited fornthe holiday, despite most of the city being in ruins. Catharinenshowed up at our door on Christmas Eve. \"You're here !\" I screamed, throwing my arms around her neck. \"Ofncourse I'm here,\" she said through her laughter. \"Now, wherenare these amazing gentlemen I've heard so much about?\" Inturned around to see Dad standing there with a sly expression on hisnface. \"They'llnbe along in a minute,\" he said. \"In the meantime, you should getnready yourselves.\" \"Dad,nwhat's—\" \"Everything'snbeen laid out in your room, Emma. For both of you.\" Utterlynconfused, I led the way upstairs to my room. Two dresses had beennlaid out on the bed, one of them my favorite light-green dancingndress. Set right above it was Mum's necklace. What on earth… Wendressed as quickly as possible, and hurried downstairs. There stoodnthe boys, both dressed for dancing and each holding a rose. \"What'sngoing on?\" I asked. Dad smiled again. \"You'llnsee, but I guarantee you'll love it.\" Catharinenand Peter chatted in German the whole way. Thomas and I were anlittle quieter. I studied my rose affectionately. \"Thisnis very sweet of you, but could you please tell me what'sngoing on?\" Thomasnonly grinned cockily as we turned a corner. Many of the buildingsnwere dark and damaged, except for one. The dance hall was brightlynlit and emitting faint music. \"I convinced your father to let younhave one night.\" Wenran for the entrance. Timendidn't exist on the dance floor. I felt light as a feather asnThomas swung me around. Sometimes he'd softly sing the slow songsninto my ear. I knew all about the swing kids by now. Here, he wasntotally free. Butnit wasn't until we got home that the biggest surprise of allnrevealed itself. \"Whatnis a white van doing at your house?\" Thomas asked. I'd beennwalking with my eyes closed, resting my head against his shoulder. \"Hmm? Oh…I'm not sure.\" It drove away as we came up the front walk. Slowly,nI opened the front door. Everything felt like a dream. The lightsnwere soft, and there, leaning on a cane, stood Ben. Allnpower of speech left my body. I was running, and then I felt Ben'snarms wrap around me. We were laughing and crying at the same time,nhugging each other like we'd never let go again. \"It's—it'snreally you!\" I finally managed to say. \"The way they told us, itnsounded like you were already dead.\" \"I'dnsay they're wrong, then,\" chuckled Ben. He held me out at arm'snlength. \"Look at you…you look so much like Mum now. It's anshame this ruined knee won't be able to dance like it used to.\" He glanced behind me. \"But I see you've made up for that. Who'snthis?\" Thomasnstepped forward to shake Ben's hand. \"Thomas Berger. I'venheard nothing but praise about you from your sister.\" Bennlooked confused. \"A German? What have you been up to, Emma?\" Ingiggled, sliding a hand into each of theirs. \"Just helping thencause with one act of kindness.\" Anlittle cheesy at the end, yes. Call me a hopeless romantic if itnmakes you feel better, not that I care.

Hi guyssss. This my first fanfiction. This story was mixed four anime which.. One piece, Beelzebub, Katekyo Hitman Reborn and Naruto. This story based at Akumano Academi which before is Ishiyama High School. From Beelzebub. The school name still same, Akumano Academi. The school assembled most of delinquent or candidate for fighter. But if there you realize a unknown name, its just my own character. For fun of course! This school was separately to four class only. Which class first for captain or leader of something. Based on their statues. Class second is for right hand man or higher job holder. The third class is for other crew. Same with class fourth. Based with their talent and power and intelligence. Clearly, this school didn't put their student by age. So, I ask a big of apologises to make a mess with their age. Coz I put their age at place i think suit. For example: Luffy:15 Sanji: 16 Robin: 16. Nami:15 Trafalgar law: 16 Cavendish:16 Lussuria:17 Zoro:16 Chopper 13: Tsuigetsu:16 Xanxus:17 Squalo:17 Bel:16 Fran:13 Bianchi:17 So I hope my lovely reader can imagine their face in such young look~ For the truth, vongola and character from Beelzebub just the only on their real age.. Gomenasaiii. Their power of course will always been show. That's fight school. Weapons are allowed!!! Including Zoro's three sword, Xanxus X guns, Box weapon, Belphegor's knife and the other. Its such a fun school ( In my thought ). The subject, of course not learn language, math or normal science. They learn how to make a bom, create a awesome ship or weapon, fight skill, cook, how to measure star at sea, war skills, historical about war only, how to manage organisation and other. Its suit for the 'delinquent' huhuhu~ The teachers was majority from Naruto like, Kakashi-sensei, yamato-sensei and other. But there is special teacher like Rayleigh from One Piece. And Zenjuuro from Beelzebub. And have some from Ninja Boy Rantaro. Hihihi... If you all realize it later. Then another apologise for the OOC. It may or will happen later. Like over sweet friendship between Belphegor and Fran. Beside that,I also put every character own BFF or partner that I think they suitable for each other. I will take from different anime for more fun ( I think ). Sometime they will stay with their originally group, but in class they will not always with their allies ~ . About their home will give in detail in story by time to time. But of course Varia will stay at their hostel, and Rokudo at Kokuyo Land like usually. I will try to make some interesting part by try to existing 'crush' part. But I not really focus on it. Because for any love story part will be create at new story~~ ( Please take a note...plzz ) About the crush or lover thing, I will not mess up with their originally lover. Like Sawada Tsunayoshi who we all already know he like Sasagawa Kyoko, so I not change it. Either like Boa Hancock that really love Monkey D.Luffy. Okay, that's all for introduction. Any info, I'll inform in next chapter. If there any question or disagree can put their opinion at comment or private message. The pentagonis character, I still decide it. But before you guys start to reading, I like to give some advice for more fun and easy for imagine the story, scene and situation. Please forget Craddle Affair, Battle Of Ring, Fighting between En-sama, Sasuke's Betrayed, Journey In One Piece and the reality of the Story. its , Fanfic. I would like to make my own plot. Hope didnt care.. I hope you all will like and vote my story. I really need reader support. So guyssss.. Please support me!! Well, I Am newbie~ _YdahBoy24 I'm not owner of KHR or One Piece or Naruto or Beelzebub. I'm just a fan...[Chapter 2] The pentagonis has been chosen. Then here is chapter 1. Please Read it until the end~ Warning!! Grammar error!!! Warning!! Out Of Character!!! The green hair boy tied his shoes and slide the sliding door. He about to going to school. \"Zoro..Matte!

Then you can protect him.\" Yamamoto say in happy tone. \"I never expect somebody will crying in such early morning..\" Zoro say while walking to them and Luffy at his side. \" Ohaiyooooo\" Luffy greet them with addition 'O' behind the greet. Yamamoto greet him back with laugh. \"Tch, Marimo will not understand what right-hand man Jyudaime feel.\" Gokudera reply with annoy greatly. \" Fine..

Class 1 Tsuna relief because he sat between Luffy and Oga Tatsumi, a baby back brawler. Even Oga is strong and sometimes show his demon face, but he is a good friend. \"Tasukata... Hibari-san was already standing near the gate but we still have a minute.\" Tsuna said as showing his glad to not be bite to death. \" Yeah.. He really strict about school rules.\" Luffy said too. \" I tought Luffy never know meaning of afraid. But its so funny to see your guys face when Hibari raised his tonfas.\" Oga joined Tsuna and Luffy conversation. \" Hibari? I also shiver when walked near him.\" Uchiha Sasuke, who sit behind Tsuna say too. They all laughing bit still control the voices because Baby Beel still sleep. \" But we need to be more awareness because Hibari and us is classmate now.\" Naruto, sit next Oga remind his friends. Hmmmm look like Hibari be their first topic for this morning. The 15 year's olds kid conversation end when their homeroom teacher, Rayleigh enter the class. The class start after Hibari entered the class use back door. Rayleigh start the class with introduction and manage class organisation. \" Okay classes, I will chose your monitor. We will not chose by any candidate. I already decided it by myself. So... The leader for First Devil Class is...\". Who? Who? Tsuna ask himself. It should be a strongest one. Not easy to handle this class, which full of delinquent. \" ...Sawada Tsunayosh!!..\" Speechless (The whole class) \" Eh!! Nani?!!!\" Tsuna hit by a big shock. He yelled and standing immediately. \" Why are you look so shock? It's your name right? Sawada Tsunayoshi, Vongola leader.\" Rayleigh repeat. \" But, Sensei..I not agree. I can't!\" Tsuna against. \" I'm sorry, but there is no against. By the way, this is time for you to show your talent as mafia leader. \" Tsuna sit back on his chair. He crying from the deep heart. 'I no want to be a mafia...' \" Hey Tsuna.. You are great. \" Luffy thumbs up and smile. Once again, Tsuna cry. \" Okay, next is assistant. Kunieda Aoi.\" Kunieda standing when Rayleigh called her name. \" Please give a hand to Sawada\" said Rayleigh. \" Yes, Sensei.\" Kunieda agree and sit back. She look at Tsuna. ' Hmmm I be more happy if it was Oga..' \" Okay, next...\" The discussion continue for a while... Class 2 Superbi Squalo - 20 Roronoa zoro -17 \" Yatta!!! Squalo our class leader!\" Zoro cried happily. Squalo look unsatisfied. He didn't want to be monitor. The second class is such full of trouble people. \" Okay, Squalo you got 3 more supporters than Zoro.\" Zenjuuro said while his hand write Squalo name at blackboard. \" But, Sensei.. I'm too busy to take over this class. Zoro is more free.\" Squalo give his opinion to not be monitor. Enough just with problem to handle Varia. No more. \" Nee Squalo, Leader not choose by his busy level, but by the supporter.\" Zoro answer for Zenjuuro. Squalo stare at Zoro with glaring like I'm-going to- kick-you-ass and Zoro just smile back. \"Tch, whatever... So, who my assistant? Better be a useful one.\" Squalo look at Zenjuuro. Zenjuuro look at his note book. \" Well, I guess she a useful one. Hyuga Hinata.\" Hinata look shock. \" Eh..me? But...\" Squalo sigh. What a troublesome. Meanwhile, Zoro giggle. He love to see Squalo's stress face. \"Zoro.. You are cheeky... Squalo gonna kill you.\" Himekawa, in front Zoro whisper to him. Zoro just smile and raise his eyebrow. Class 3 Class 4 There no much problem. But still sometimes got rebellion. However the leader is Killer and assistant is Chrome Dokuro.

Furuichi is a coward, but I bet, he gonna be a brave one because Baby 5 is such a adorable girl.~ \" Kunieda-san!\" Tsuna chase her after she out from class with her best friend, Nene. Kunieda look at Tsuna. He already hunchback and say \" I hope you can back me up. I'm a coward and weak, control this class such a burden to me. So, help me.

She also smile to show her sincerely. \" Arigatou gozaimashita!\" Tsuna utter in happy. Then Kunieda continue her stride. \" Nee-san.. Is that your leader?

Ashamed yourselves! Now take back your paperworks and do it yourselves. No one can out for on this class as long as you didn't done this task!\" For a moment they are silent and then everybody take back their paper and sit. Tsuna relief. Thanks to Kunieda. Hibari put his paperwork on Tsuna's table and out from class. Tsuna checking the paper. 'Sugoii.. Hibari-san really done it..' Tsuna thought to himself. Sun was about to set. Students from class one starting to back to home. After Tsuna give to Reyleigh the pile of paperwork, he walking out from school. \"Fyuhhh.. What a tired day..\" He said as wiped sweat from his forehead. \"Tsuna!!\" \"Jyudaime!\" Tsuna look shock when saw his friends standing under the tree and smiling at him. \"Why are two doing here?\" Tsuna asking. \" Well..I'm waiting for you.. But I don't know why this yakyu-bàka following me..\" Said Gokudera. He pointing his thumb to Yamamoto. \" What? I'm want to walking home with Tsuna too..\" Answer Yamamoto with his delight smile.

This story was mi"},{"Movie":"Swing Kids","Title":"No title as of now","Author":"Mandy Kay Miller","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/807670","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: yes, this fic is ALSO screwed up. =) Peter and Thomas are HJs, but they are GOOD HJs. Arvid is alive, everything's happy. One thing you'll notice about my stories: I put a person's name in capital letters at the beginning of a chapter and that's who's POV it is. The first few are Peter, but I do have others. Promise! =) Oh, and nothing is mine except Lorraine, Leone, her dad, Conrad, and Garrett. You can use them if you want, just please ask first because I'd like to know. PETER \"So what does this beauty of yours look like?\" I asked my friend Arvid as I sat down at the table where he, Otto, and Garrett sat. \"I've heard a lot about her.\" \"Leone?\" Arvid asked. I shrugged. \"I don't know. The pretty one.\" \"You have to see her!\" Garrett said. \"She's gorgeous!\" I looked at him, smiling. Garrett's approval was hard to get, so she must have really been as pretty as they claimed. I was happy for Arvid; that he was able to find a nice girlfriend. I thought that he'd enjoy Helga, the girl that I'd set him up with before, but they claimed to be friends. Still, I couldn't help but wonder how she felt about Leone, Arvid's new girl. \"What have you heard?\" Otto asked. I nodded to Garrett. \"That she's gorgeous. And a good dancer, nice, proper…\" Arvid's head perked up when he spotted someone who'd entered. \"She's here.\" He began to get up, but Otto put his hand on his shoulder and got up himself. \"It's OK. I will.\" I watched him walk up to a redhead and say something, grab her hand, and slowly lead her towards us. I wasn't lied to. Her silky, yet explosive red hair must have been the envy of every girl on earth. She had a fair, pale complexion that made her look rich. And her eyes were a light green, lighter than I'd ever seen. In fact, they were a little too light. Almost cloudy… \"Arvid is here,\" Otto said, placing her hand on him. Then he took it off and pointed with it. \"Peter is right there, and Garrett is over there.\" I gave Arvid a confused look. What was going on? Why was he pointing? \"She's blind,\" Arvid said a little quietly. He didn't want to announce it. He pulled out a chair next to him and showed her where it was. \"Please, sit down.\" I'd never encountered a blind person before. Other than Arvid, I'd never actually met a disabled person before. I didn't know what to say, how to act. I guess it was a little to my advantage that she couldn't see my reaction. Leone turned to me, like she knew exactly where I was. That much surprised me. I decided that she knew based on where Otto had pointed. \"I haven't met you before, have I?\" \"No,\" I replied. She held her hand out. \"My name's Leone. You may have already known, but we need to properly introduce ourselves.\" I shook it. \"I'm Peter.\" Leone smiled. \"It's a pleasure to meet you. We'll have to dance later.\" I wondered briefly if a blind person could swing dance. \"I look forward to it.\" She laughed. \"Arvid, your friends are certainly polite.\" \"Peter just likes pretty girls,\" Garrett replied. She laughed again. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" \"How long are you staying?\" Arvid asked her. \"I'm not sure. An hour, perhaps. I don't want to leave Conrad alone for long with father.\" \"Tell me before you leave so I can walk you home.\" \"You don't have to.\" \"That doesn't matter. I want to.\" Leone smiled and kissed him on the cheek. \"You're so sweet.\" She stood and walked away. As if right on cue, Thomas walked up to us and sat down just then. \"What happened?\" he asked, watching Leone walk away. He was in his usual joking mood. \"Did Peter scare away the girl again?\" The comment earned him a few chuckles from Garrett, Otto, and Arvid and a playful hit from me. \"I don't mind,\" Arvid said. \"I'm going to see her later. I'm walking her home.\" \"Are you sure you want to do that? Wouldn't it make a pretty good target for the HJs?\" Dang it, Thomas, I thought. If only you could keep your insults and \"jokes\" to yourself.[Chapter 2] PETER I licked my lips and watched Lorraine. She didn't know I was watching her from the other side of the street. She had blond hair and blue eyes. The perfect Aryan… I looked down at my black HJ uniform. I looked better in the black than tan. I never thought that being an HJ would be good for anything, but finally it was. I had a much better chance with her if I was wearing a Swastika. I sighed and stared at her hair. I couldn't get over it. She wouldn't go for me. I… I had brown hair. Get a grip, I told myself. Don't let her looks intimidate you. Just walk up to her and ask her to go to the Café Bismark.[Chapter 3] A/N: the next chapter is from Garrett's POV, so don't worry! Then it's Arvid, then Leone… I'm trying to not do too many Peters just because the first 3 are all Peter. Anyway, here's the next one! Enjoy! PETER \"Do you think she's going to come?\" I asked Otto as we stood by the doors. I figured that if she walked in and heard Swing she'd storm out right away, so I made sure I was at the door to stop her long enough for Garrett and Thomas to see. \"I don't know. The General's daughter? That could be risky.\" \"She's not coming,\" I said. \"she was just being nice before. Playing along.\" \"Don't say that. She knows you're an HJ. She has no idea that you're a Swing Kid.\" \"It doesn't matter. She doesn't like me.\" \"It's 5 after 7,\" he said. \"If she's coming, she's late.\" \"Perfect,\" I muttered. I couldn't remember when I'd been so anxious. I'd always been good around girls. \"Well, good luck,\" Otto said. \"I hope she shows.\" Then he left. When Lorraine walked in I almost jumped for joy. I'd done it! The Nazi General's daughter was at a swing party because of me! I'd won the bet! Lorraine took a quick glance around and turned to leave, but I caught her arm. \"You can't leave so soon,\" I said. \"Sit down. Relax.\" \"Swing?\" she demanded, obviously furious. \"How could you trick me like this?\" \"It isn't a trick,\" I replied. \"Let's eat.\" \"What is this? A stupid game? I have mind to report you, Peter Mueller!\" Suddenly, it wasn't about a dumb bet anymore. If she reported me I'd be sent away. No questions asked. And if she told them it was at the Café Bismark I wouldn't be the only one. \"It's music,\" I said, my voice pleading. \"Just music.\" \"JEWISH[Chapter 4] Here we go again…. Lord knows it's beennyears since I've updated this fic. It's actually finished,nsitting in my notebook, I just don't have all the chapters typednup. Hopefully someone can still enjoy it, even though I wrotenit such a long time ago so it's… not my best work. Sorrynthis chap's so short, too. In fact, y'know what? Ifnyou like it, great, but if you don't, don't even bother tellingnme what's wrong with it. Because I already know. GARRETT I spotted a pretty blonde girl heading out of the Bismark. Shenlooked a lot like Van Esling's daughter. I wondered if shenwas, then decided to approach her. I tapped her on the shouldernas she was about to leave and she turned around to look at me. nDefinitely a Van Esling; she was stunning. \"Lorraine Van Esling?\" I asked. She exploded. \"What?\" she demanded, voice raised and angry eyes flared. n\"Am I famous among the rats? Who are you?\" \"My name is Derrik,\" I lied. I'd learned that it'sndangerous to give out my real name while at a swing party, especiallynto a Nazi general's daughter. \"How do you know my name?\" \"You just look a lot like her is all.\" \"If you dare touch me again I'll report you,\" she said. nThen she stormed out of the cafe. I caught myself wondering what exactly had just happened between us. Peter must have scared her away, I thought. When I sawnhim across the room sitting down at a table, I walked over and satnnext to him. \"I saw Lorraine,\" I said casually. \"She's going to report me,\" he said, seemingly distant. n\"And probably the rest of the people here.\" \"So, what now?\" \"I don't know. She might not do it.\" Though henspoke a word of hope, Peter looked extremely nervous. \"We should stop the band?\" I wondered. \"So if they comenin...\" \"We'll know about it,\" Peter answered me. \"They aren'tnthe only people with brains. We have lookouts. We...\" nHe stopped suddenly, then shook his head a little. \"I'mnrambling, aren't I?\" I smiled and nodded. \"Yes, you are. But don't worry;nyou're right. If they bust in, we'll know about it first.\" \"Still...\" Peter's head perked up. \"Leone'snhere.\" I looked over to the door and saw her enter. God put extraneffort into her, and that much was obvious to any person who lookednat her. It seemed like Leone was always in the center. nEveryone was always looking at her, revolving around her, and she wasnnever less than perfect. Leone was the kind of person who couldntalk a long walk outside on a rainy day and stay dry the whole time;nshe simply had that essence about her. She could run anmarathon, win, and manage to never sweat or mess up her hair. nShe didn't even try, which made her all the more perfect. Shenwas simply that way. A natural goddess. \"She's perfect,\" I murmured. \"No she isn't,\" Peter said, seeing the look on her face. n\"She's hurt.\" Then, after my daydream ended, I was able to see what Peter hadnseen. Her expression... something was largely wrong. Wenhurried over to her. When Peter touched her hand, her other onenflew up and smacked him in the face. \"Leone! Leone!\" I said quickly. \"It's Peter andnGarrett. It's okay. What's wrong?\" \"I'm sorry!\" she said instantly. \"Which one did I hit? nI'm so sorry!\" \"Peter,\" Peter said. \"You hit Peter, me. But that'snalright; I'm used to it. What's wrong?\" \"Where is Arvid?\" she asked us. I looked to Peter. I hadn't seen Arvid yet tonight, and itnappeared that Peter hadn't either, because he shook his head. n\"I don't know. Why?\" \"I need to talk to him,\" she said. \"I really need to talknto him. Where does he live? Can you take me there?\" \"I don't – \" \"Please!\" she begged. Tears formed in her vacant, blindneyes. She spoke again with a quivering lip. \"I... Inneed someone.\" Next chapter... ARVID ...\"What happened?\" I asked, getting off mynbed... ...\"He hit Conrad. He... he hit him.\"... ... \"Leone, did he touch you?\" ... \"I heard Conrad yell. I tried to stop it... hold me...\" ... Leone sniffed and pulled away to face me. She pulled up hernlong red hair so that her shoulder showed... it was still bleedingnquite a bit... ... \"Where are you?\" she asked suddenly, her voice slightlynshrill. \"I can't feel you! Arvid!\" ","Summary":" A/N: yes, this fic is ALSO screwed up. =) Peter and Thomas are HJs, but they are GOOD HJs.

Надявам се тук да има хоря, които знаят бългърски. Та така. Тук мисля да побликувам историите ми, които пиша и в приложението Wattpad. Първата, която ще побликувам е Destroyed Souls: I miss you, love. Дано да ви харесва както и на читателите в Wattpad! Proluge. ,Mинаха две години. Две мъчителни години. Дори не знам защо пиша това чак сега. Явно имам нуждата да споделя с някой. Да споделя нашата история. История за две разрушени души, които се намират след дълго време. Просто се влюбих. Мога да кажа, че бях влюбен до уши в нея. Но ми беше отнета. Не е най-щастливата история, но си има и своите моменти на забава. Не започва добре, но и не свършва добре. Не е от историите, които започват с , Имало едно време... \" и не завършва с , И заживели щастливо... \". Наистина. Понякога се питам. Какво толкова сме направили, че да заслужим такава съдба? Поне тя нищо лошо не беше направила. Минахме през толкова изпитания и до къде стигнахме? Няма я. Това ме разбива от вътре на милиони парчета само като си помисля, че е далеч от мен в момента. И то доста далеч. Скочихме и стигнахме дъното, края на възможностите си. Но всеки край е ново начало, нали? Но не и този път. Не и за нея. Като имате предвид, че първоначално я ненавиждах, заради брат ѝ. Но после като я опознах, а още повече, разбрах, че се познаваме от деца, просто се влюбих. Влюбих се в това синеоко и красиво изпълнено с живот същество. Мога да кажа, че тя беше първата ми истинска любов и май ще си остане и последната. Не мога да обикна така човек, както си позволих да обикна нея. С нея се чувствам себе си и имам чувството, че само тя ме разбираше. А сега като я няма...разбирам колко ценни са били малките неща. Като примерно: всяка сутрин да се чуди какво да облече или да направи за закуска. Толкова ми липсва да я видя как носи моята тениска, която съм и дал и се опитвам да я накарам да си я сложи. Защо не мога да я забравя? Винаги като постигна някакъв напредък и създам някаква защитна стена, тя бива събаряна. Винаги. Не мога да понеса това, че заради миналото ми тя си отиде. Отнеха ми я, без да разбера, без да осъзная, че това бяха последните ни мигове заедно. Отнеха я от света. Историята ни не започна както започва с всички връзки. Още в първия ден когато се видяхме и я поканих да излезем още същата вечер. Просто ми дойде от вътре и я целунах. Тогава не я харесвах, а се жертвах за общото благо на групата от така наречените ми , приятели ''. Но за всичко си има първи път, не мислите ли? Точно. За това се чудя какво ще стане с мен. Ще живея ли отново щастливо без нея? Не ми се вярва, но поне ще намеря ли, ще изпитам малко щастие? Дори и съвсем малко и то за кракто? Дължах ѝ толкова много. С нейна помощ успях да разбера истината за живота ми. Разбрах кои са истинските ми приятели, благодарение на нея. Всичко хубаво в живота ми го донесе тя. Донесе го и след това си го взе със себе си. Имам страшно голямата нужда да чуя този глас, да видя тези сини очи да ме гледат с необятна и мистериозна искра в тях. Просто искам да я видя дори и за част от секундата. Живота е толкова нечестен. Тя какво беше направила, че да заслужи това? Вярно. Аз не съм света вода, но аз заслужавах такава съдба. Тя трябва да е тук на мое място. Да намери човек, който да ѝ даде щастието, да направи това, което аз не успях да направя. Да създаде семейство. Да има внуци, но не. Съдбата избра аз да съм тук. Толкова те обичам, любов. И знам, че си там и ме виждаш, както и чуваш, но това звучи толкова наудничиво, за да е истина, но просто го чувствам, че си там някъде и ме чакаш. Ужасно силно те обичам, не го забравяй. Липсваш ми. Липсваш ми толкова шибано много. Ще има ли щастлив край все пак на тази лудост?

The boys were reading sports magazines while drinking a glass of cold lemonade. The rest of the Monstars stopped reading their magazine when Pound started speaking. \"Well boys, it's the first day of do you guys want to do first?\" Bupkus,Blanko,Bang, and Nawt worked together to brainstorm ideas on what they should do for the first day of summer. Finally, the four Monstars had an idea. \"How about we go on a camping trip to explore the wilderness?\" Bupkus suggested. Blanko replied,\"Yeah can go hiking and explore nature.\" Bang said \"We can even roast marshmallows, roast hot dogs, cook some beans, and make delicious s'mores for dessert.\" Nawt added, \"Don't forget about fishing.\" Pound thought about it for a bit and liked the idea of going camping. \"That's not a bad idea you guys.\" said Pound, \"In fact, that's a great idea! We'll start our camping trip this Wednesday.\" Bupkus,Blanko,Bang, and Nawt both gave each other a hive five after Pound accepted the asked \"Hey Pound, can we text to our friends to see if they would like to come too?\" \"Sure. I don't see why not. \"Pound said. The Monstars grabbed their cell phones out from their pocket and starts texting to their friends to see if they want to join them on their camping trip. After they finished texting their friends about their upcoming camping trip, the boys did some planning on how they'll be prepared for the trip. Pound said, \"Alright boys, it's settled. We're going camping on Wednesday!\"The Monstars cheered with excitement when they knew that they were about to go camping on Wednesday.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The next morning, the Monstars were in the kitchen eating pancakes, sausages, scrambled eggs, and toast for breakfast with orange juice. While eating their meal, the boys were coming up with plans for their camping trip. \"Man you guys, I can't wait to go camping with some of our friends.\" Bupkus said. Bang agreed with him, \"You got that right Bupkus. I'll even bring some of my cooking supplies to cook some food when we start camping tomorrow.\" Nawt was also excited for the camping trip. \"This is going to awesome!\" he said with glee, \"When we go fishing tomorrow, I'm gonna catch a huge fish!\" \"This is exciting dudes!\" Blanko said, \"Who knows what we'll discover in the wilderness.\" After Pound finished his pancakes, he told the boys to calm down the boys down and told them that they need a plan before their trip starts tomorrow. \"Alright boys, listen up. If we want to prepare ourselves for the wilderness we'll need some equipment.\"Nawt asked, \"Like what Pound?\" Pound replied, \"You know, stuff like food,water,snacks, new clothes and fishing gear.\" Bupkus said, \"That doesn't sound too much. So all we gotta do is do a little shopping and we'll have all the stuff we need for our camping trip tomorrow.\" Pound replied, \"Exactly.\" Nawt had a question and decided to ask Pound about it, \"That sounds like a good idea Pound but why do we need new clothes?\"Pound replied, \"To make us look like we're prepared for the understood and said, \"Oh, that makes perfect sense.\" \"Alright then. Today, we'll head to the mall to get all the stuff we need for tomorrow.\"Pound told the others. After the Monstars finished eating breakfast and cleaned their dirty dishes, they went into their car inside the garage of their mansion. After Pound opens the door with the garage door opener, he drives the car out of the he closed the garage door, he drove the car away from the mansion to head to the mall.[Chapter 3] Chapter:3 Meanwhile inside the mall, the Monstars were about to do some shopping for some camping equipment for their big camping trip tomorrow. Pound said, \"Alright boys. Now that we're here let's get down to business.\" Pound gave the rest of Monstars different tasks to find what they need for their trip. \"Bupkus and Bang, you two will be in charge of getting snacks and the stuff we need to make s'mores.\" Bupkus said, \"No problem Pound. Buying snacks and the stuff we need to make s'mores from the store is easy.\" \"Bupkus is right.\" Bang said, \"We'll do fine.\" Pound smiled and said, \"That's the spirit!\" The orange leader continued giving each task for his teammates and himself. \"Nawt and Blanko, you two will be in charge of getting the fishing gear and I'll buy us all some backpacks to put our camping stuff in.\" \"Sounds like a great plan Pound.\" said Nawt. \"Yeah man, we'll be able to get everything we need for our trip in a flash.\" Blanko said as he snaps his fingers together. \"Good to hear that!\" Pound said with a smile, \"Now let's split up and get shopping! Meet me at the food court for lunch at 12:00.\" The five Monstars went to different shops and stores inside the mall to get everything they need for their big camping trip. After two hours of shopping, Pound and the rest of the boys met each other at the food court while holding lots of shopping bags. Pound said, \"Right on time you guys. Did all of you get everything we need for our camping trip?\" \"Bupkus replied, \"We sure did Pound. Bang and I got all the snacks we need for our trip.\" Bang said, \"We also got boxes of graham crackers, milk chocolate bars, and bags of marshmallows to make s'mores.\" Nawt said, \"Blanko and I also got fishing rods and other fishing supplies.\" Blanko asked Pound, \"What about you Pound? Did you get the backpacks?\" Pound replied, \"I sure did. I got us all some backpacks that has the same color we do.\" Pound and the rest of the boys went to an empty table and sat down on each five chairs after they put bags next to their seats. The boys were exhausted after shopping for two hours. Suddenly, the rest of the Monstars heard Nawt's stomach growling. Nawt rubbed his belly and said, \"Man, all of that shopping sure works up an appetite.\" Pound got out of his sit and asked his team, \"What do you boys say we get a pepperoni pizza for lunch?\" \"Yeah.\" Bupkus,Blanko,Bang, and Nawt said as they smiled. The rest of the boys liked the idea and got out their seats as they head to a pizzeria outlet named, \"Papa Lorenzo's Pizza.\" to get a pepperoni pizza lunch.[Chapter 4] Chapter:4 Thirteen minutes later in the food court, the Monstars were sitting back at their table, eating slices of pepperoni pizza they ordered with a side of garlic knots in a medium plastic container, tomato dipping sauce, and drinking cups of cherry cola. While the five aliens were enjoying their lunch, they heard the notification sound from their phones inside their pockets. They grabbed their phones out of their pockets and saw text messages from Bugs,Daffy,Porky,Taz,Wile E. Coyote,and Yosemite Sam. \"Hey guys, we got a bunch text from some of our friends.\" Nawt told his friends with his mouth full of pizza. Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang glared at Nawt after he finished talking while chewing his pizza. \"We already knew that group texted them yesterday. Remember?\" Bang reminded Nawt. Nawt replied with his mouth full of pizza once again, \"Oh yeah.\" \"And don't talk with your mouth full Nawt! You'll choke!\" Bupkus scolded at him. Nawt swallowed his pizza and showed an embarrassing smile as his face starts to blush. \"Oops,sorry.\" He said while blushing. \"Anyway, let's see the text messages some of our friends sent us about joining us on our camping trip tomorrow.\" Pound said told the others. The Monstars looked at the text messages Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Taz, Wile E. Coyote, and Yosemite Sam. Their messages read: Bugs : A camping trip huh? I was going to organize my carrot collection in my rabbit hole tomorrow, but I don't see why not. What time do you us to meet you guys in front of your mansion? Daffy : Meh,why not? I got nothing better else to do this summer. Porky : A camping trip sounds like a great idea! Count me in! Taz : Oh! A camping trip? Taz wanna come too! Wile E. Coyote : Sounds splendid. Yosemite Sam : A camping trip? Ah what the heck. Can't say no to a camping trip that tests your manliness. The Monstars text back: Hey guys! We're glad that some of you boys will be joining us on our big camping trip. It's going to be a lot of fun! We'll go hiking, explore nature, have a picnic, roast marshmallows, make s'mores, and sleep in cool comfortable cabins. Meet us outside our mansion at 10:30 tomorrow in the morning. After the five boys finished texting, they put their cell phones back in their pockets. \"Alright boys.\" Pound said to the others, \"Now that we texted some of our friends about our camping trip, let's finish our pizza lunch and shop for some clothes for us to wear for tomorrow.\" The five Monstars continued to eat their large pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, and drink their cups of cherry cola in the food court before they shop for new clothes to wear for their big camping trip tomorrow.[Chapter 5] Chapter:5 After the Monstars finished their pizza lunch and cleaned their table, they left the food court with satisfied looks on their faces while rubbing their bellies filled with pizza. \"Man that was good pizza.\" said Blanko. Bang sighed, \"You can say that again Blanko.\" Pound agreed. \"Those garlic knots were good too.\" Nawt said while licking tomato sauce off his fingers. Bupkus said, \"I couldn't agree with you guys more.\" Suddenly, Bupkus let out a huge burp which startled the rest of the boys and caused him to blush while smiling as he excused himself. \"Whoops, pardon me.\" Bupkus said. \"Alright boys.\" Pound said to the others, \"Now that we had our lunch, let's shop for new clothes for our camping trip tomorrow morning and head home.\" \"I can't wait to try out some new clothes!\" Nawt said with enthusiasm. \"Yeah dude. This is gonna be awesome!\" said Blanko. \"New clothes for camping? I'm in!\" said Bang. \"I'm in too!\" Bupkus said with delight. \"Glad you boys are on board with this.\" said Pound, But before we buy any clothes for our camping trip, we'll need to do some browsing before start choosing what clothes we want to wear. After we choose the clothes we like, we'll head to the dressing room to see if they fit. After that, we'll get back into our jerseys and sneakers in the dressing room then pay for our new clothes.\" \"Sounds like a pretty solid plan Pound.\" said Bupkus. \"It sure is.\" Pound replied, \"Now come on boys, time to shop for some camping clothes.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter:6 While the five Monstars carried their bags full of groceries and stuff they need for their camping trip tomorrow, they went to a store inside the mall that sells clothes, shoes, pants, jackets, and many more. When the boys got inside, they were amazed at the numerous amounts of clothes they have in the store.\"Alright boys!\" Pound said as he got the others' attention, \"We're going to look for some new clothes to wear for our camping trip tomorrow.\" \"Awesome Pound! So what's the plan?\" asked Blanko. Pound starts explaining his plan to the other Monstars. \"It's easy. All we have to do is look around and see if there's any clothes that we would like to wear and find out if their right size for us by trying them on in the dressing room. After that, we'll put our jerseys, shorts, and sneakers back on, purchase our new clothes, and get the heck out of here.\" \"Sounds a great plan Pound. I can't wait to try on some new clothes!\" Bupkus said smiling. \"Well, you're the boss. Let's do it!\" said Bang. \"This is gonna be sweet!\" Nawt said. \"Okay guys, let's finish our shopping!\" Pound told the others. So the five Monstars went to the men's section and started their search for new clothes and shoes to wear for their camping trip. After trying on some shoes and boots, they picked the one's they like and the one's that fit. The boys continued their search for new clothes in the store. After 15 minutes of searching, the Monstars finally found some clothes they like. The five of them headed to the dressing room while carrying the clothes they chose to try on. Pound chose a red plaid shirt, blue jeans, and light brown hiking boots; Bupkus chose a white muscle shirt, blue pants, and black boots; Blanko chose a blue and black plaid shirt, grey shorts, and dark blue tennis shoes; Bang chose a grey muscle shirt,dark brown shorts, and beige boots; and Nawt chose a royal blue t shirt, beige shorts, and red sneakers. \"Okay boys.\" says Pound, \"Now that we've chosen the clothes we would like to wear tomorrow, the next step is to try them on to see if they fit.\" \"Well what are we waiting for? Let's do it!\" said Nawt. The Monstars carried their clothes to the dressing booths in the men's side of the dressing room and closed the curtains so they can change clothes. After they took off their jerseys, shorts, and sneakers, the boys changed into the clothes they chose to wear for their big trip. Each Monstar looked themselves in the mirrors in the dressing booths so they can see how they look. The Monstars were impressed of how they look wearing the clothes they chose while looking in their mirrors; especially Bupkus. Bupkus started smiling as he wiggled his eyebrows and flexing his muscles while looking at his reflection from the mirror. \"These clothes fit perfectly.\" he said to himself, \"Looking good Bupkus.\" Bupkus pushed his hair back with his right hand and bounced back into its normal position. \"Mmmmm, handsome.\" Bupkus said in a deep voice. \"Alright boys.\" Pound said to the others, \"Before we change back into our normal clothes, let's see what we look like in these clothes first.\"The five Monstars got out of the dressing booths and saw each other wearing the clothes they chose to wear for their camping trip. Pound was impressed at how amazingly stunning his friends look. \"Wow! You guys look amazing!\" he complimented the others. \"Thanks Pound.\" said Bang, \"You look pretty good in those clothes too.\" \"Yeah dude.\" said Blanko, \"You look awesome!\" Pound smiled and replied, \"Thanks you guys. I thought the exact same thing when I saw myself in these clothes, and they fit too.\" \"I agree! \"Nawt said with glee, \"We look so cool in these clothes!\" \"You can say that again. These clothes makes me look like a hunk.\" Bupkus said while smiling and flexing his right muscle. Bang rolled his eyes and chuckled, \"Whatever you say Romeo.\" \"Alright boys.\" Pound said to his crew, \"Now that we know the clothes we chose are the right size for us, let's change back into our normal clothes, purchase our new clothes, and head back home.\" \"This is gonna be awesome!\" Nawt said with glee, \"Wait until our friends gets a load of us tomorrow!\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: After the Monstars went back to the dressing booths, they changed back into their jerseys, shorts, and sneakers. When the boys left the dressing room, they carried their bags including the clothes they chose to wear for their camping trip and went straight to the checkout line to purchase their new clothes. After ten minutes of waiting in line, they purchased their clothes and left the store carrying their shopping bags. The boys were exhausted after doing a lot of shopping for the things they need for their big camping trip tomorrow. \"Dudes, I'm exhausted from all of that shopping.\" Blanko groaned as he wiped sweat off his head. \"You're not the only one Blanko.\" Nawt replied. \"Guys I couldn't agree more.\" said Bang. \"Me too. This has to be the most exhausting day of our lives.\" Nawt moaned. \"C'mon you guys.\" Pound told the others, \"I know we're feeling sluggish after shopping for so long but that's ok. Once we head back to our car, we can get the heck out of here and start packing for our trip tomorrow when we get back home.\" \"That's good, I'm tired of shopping.\" Bang groaned. Suddenly the rest of the Monstars heard Nawt's stomach growling. \"I don't know about you guys but I'm super hungry.\" said Nawt. \"Maybe when we get back home, I can cook up some pork chops with mashed potatoes, green beans, and blueberry pie for dessert before we start packing for our camping trip.\" said Bang. \"Well it is getting a little late anyway.\" Pound said while looking at the clock from his cell phone. \"C'mon boys, let's head home.\" The five Monstars left the mall carrying their shopping bags and went back to the parking lot where their car is. After they put their bags in the trunk, the boys went back into their car and drove out of the parking lot to head back to their mansion to eat dinner.[Chapter 8] Chapter:8 Meanwhile back in the Monstars' mansion, after the gang got back from the mall, the boys put all of their snacks for camp on the kitchen counter,and their camping clothes and supplies in their rooms, The Monstars were in the kitchen eating pork chops with mashed potatoes and green beans Bang made for dinner while waiting for his blueberry pie to bake in their oven. The rest of the boys enjoyed their meal as they continue to eat. Blanko swallowed his food and said, \"Man Bang, these pork chops are delicious with these mashed potatoes and green beans.\" Bang smiled at Blanko's complement. \"Thanks Blanko. I appreciate that.\" he replied. Suddenly, the gang heard the oven's timer go off when Bang's pie was finished baking. He got out of his seat and went to the oven to check on his pie. When Bang opened the oven's lid while wearing oven mitts, he saw how good his pie looked. \"Oh good my pie done.\" he said as he puts the pie on the counter to cool down. Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt smelled the delicious aroma from Bang's blueberry pie from the kitchen to the dining room and loved it. \"Mmm,that pie smells good.\" said Bupkus. Bang replied, \"It sure does. I'll let it cool down for five minutes so we can eat some for dessert.\" Bang went to his seat and the rest of the Monstars continued to finish their dinner. After the Monstars finished eating their dinner, the five started to discuss about where they are going for their big camping trip. \"So where are we going for our camping trip tomorrow Bupkus?\" asked Pound. Bupkus replied, \"I was thinking we should go to The Warner Bros. National Park. I looked it up last week and it's got comfy cabins, a beautiful environment, a nice, clean lake, and it even has a basketball court.\" \"That sounds awesome dude!\" said Blanko. \"I agree Blanko.\" says Nawt, \"That does sound awesome!\" \"Yeah Bupkus.\" said Pound, \"That sounds like a great place for camping.\" \"It sure does.\" Bupkus replied. \"Hey Bang.\" said Blanko,\"Is the pie cool enough to eat yet?\" Bang replied, \"Yeah, it's cool enough to eat.\"[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Bang grabbed a knife from the top kitchen drawer and cut the pie into five rest of the Monstars lined up in front of him as he placed one slice of blueberry pie on each of their plate with a spatula. After Bang puts the last slice on his plate, he heads back to the dining room with the rest of the Monstars and started eating their slices of pie. \"Mmmm, this blueberry pie is delicious Bang!\" said Blanko. \"You can say that again.\" said Bupkus. \"This tastes good. Thanks for the pie Bang.\" said Nawt. \"No problem.\" Bang replied. \"Alright boys.\" said Pound. \"Let's start packing our bags and take a nice shower so we can get ready for our camping trip tomorrow. We'll make our lunches after breakfast first thing in the morning.\" So after the Monstars clean the dishes and put them away, they all went upstairs into their rooms and started packing most of their belongs in their camping bags. In Bupkus' room, while he was packing his stuff in his bag, he grabbed Mr. Snuggles, his teddy bear from behind his pillow and gave it a big hug. \"Hey .\" he said to the stuffed bear, \"Guess what? You're coming with me on our camping trip tomorrow. Bupkus gave his teddy bear a big kiss and said \"goodnight\" to it as he puts it in his bag. After each of the Monstars finished packing their bags and took turns taking a nice hot shower to freshen up, they all brushed their teeth in the bathroom and went back into their rooms to head to bed. The five aliens went into pajamas and said \"goodnight\" to each other as they turn off the lights and headed straight to bed. ","Summary":" Chapter 1: It was the first day of summer and the Monstars were in their backyard sitting on beach "},{"Movie":"Space Jam","Title":"Space Jam - Revolution","Author":"Empress Oriana","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182839","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello again! I wonder how long it's been since I got the chance to write down a new story.. hmm.. Probably not in a good while. Well guess what? I decided to make a new (doubtfully the last) Space Jam fanfiction for you all to read. This will be another time skip, so I hope you all don't mind! :) Ready? Two Years Later… \"Alright, I see that you got the whole concept of particle combustion. Now your essay doesn't seem to have any flaws from what I see. You got the grammar structure down in a good flow and.. Kari, are you listening?\" Hale looked sternly as his younger sister, who was fast asleep on the study desk with her head buried in her arms. Hale growled lowly before rolling up the five page essay in his hands and whacking his younger sibling across the head with it, causing her to snap up into attention with a panicking start. \"WHAT? WHO DIED?! ARE WE UNDER ATTACK?!\", she hollered with disarray. Hale glared daggers at her. \"No, no one died.. yet. \" Hale sighed exasperatedly and rubbed his temples with his fingers, \"Kari, you do realize that this is your last year of high school, and you DO realize that I'm trying to help you pass your chemistry class, which you are borderline of getting a 'C'?\" Kari lowered her head bashfully. \"I'm sorry, Hale. I just haven't been getting much sleep, what with all the studying that we've been doing lately.\" Hale glanced up at her and smiled wryly. \"I know, but you can't keep falling asleep every time either. Now, I just finished reviewing your term paper. It looks good enough to be weighed as a 'B+', maybe an 'A-' if you're lucky. The grammar was good and it looks like you got a full understanding of your topic.\" He flipped through the pages with satisfaction. Kari yawned and then smiled brightly. \"Awesome! So I should be able to bump my grade up to a good rank!\" Hale chuckled with amusement, \"Yeah, it should bring your grade up to a 'B' average, at least. Keep this up for the next couple months and you'll have an 'A' like the rest of your classes and get on the principal's list.\" Hale and Kari grinned at each other gleefully. It's been a few more years since the Rodgers siblings had to go through another bout against the evil Swackhammer. After reuniting with their friends the Looney Tunes, the Monstars, and with the help of some new friends, the young teens were able to finally put an end to Swackhammer and his cruel plots once and for all. Now after two years since then, many changes have taken place. Hale is now at the ripe age of twenty years and has boarded with a full scholarship to a local community college. His hair grew slightly, making him look more Japanese than ever and has even gotten a few inches taller. He now regularly sports well fitted jeans and a white shirt with a black blazer with a printed cross on the back and a pair of black loafers, making him look like some Japanese rock star. He started dating Elise shortly after their return back from Moron Mountain two years prior. Also, both he and sister continue to create music for theirs and their loved ones, as well as doing occasional tours around their community for fun entertainment. Kari has blossomed even further as well. She decided to let her hair grow out to her waist, but kept her bangs in a straight cut. She still remained her same height of five foot five, but filled out her figure and toned up. She normally sports now a grey jean skirt with faded blue converses and a teal tank top with a light blue jean vest. Her eyes became slightly lighter in its color in addition, lighting up her facial features. In relationship terms, she and her Monstar boyfriend Nawt still continue dating and hang out more than they ever had before in the years past. After the defeat of Swackhammer, the two young lovebirds took their time to catch up over many lost years of being in each other's company, piecing back their lives one piece at a time. As for the rest of the Monstars, they too have begun having their share of companionship as well. Pound and Mika spend their time walking around the park and messing around with Photoshop with pictures that Mika takes during their personal adventures. Blanko and Nada spend their quality time with one another tending to Blanko's garden and sorting out flowers. Every now and then, Blanko would get a nice bouquet of 'Forget Me Not's for Nada, knowing that those became her favorite flowers since they reminded her very much of him. Bupkus and Lexi have taken a turn for the better, as they both spend their time in Lexi's personal gymnasium working out and on occasion, playing some rounds of bowling, which soon became Bupkus' favorite pastime. Bupkus even sneaks out to the Rodgers residence to help out to babysit Hale and Kari's cousin Marie when she was down there to visit. Marie and her mother decided to move close by the neighborhood where Kari and Hale lived, considering that the young child was very close to her older cousins and grew extremely fond of Bupkus, to whom she still continues to call by the pet name \"Kitty\". Though he will never admit it, he personally adores the name. As for Bang and Maddie, they were like two green peas in a pod. Those two continued rocking out to the most hard core rock bands out there and enjoy playing COD on Maddie's XBOX 360 (she wins 30 to 10 against him by far). Whenever the entire gang gets together, they insist on barbequing, much to Pound's dismay. In the account of the Looney Tunes, they were still causing comical mischief and fun in Looney Tune Land. Bugs on more than one occasion invited the human teens over to join them in festivities and entertainment, which was almost most of the time. Life became easy again, at least for the time being. Now that Hale finished high school, Kari is now a senior herself and is currently struggling to reach the top, just like her older brother. Now that she's within the cusp of getting straight 'A's, she knows for sure she's got her final year of high school in the bag. Also like her brother, she achieved scholarships from joining the girls' basketball team, just as he join the boys' basketball team. Wrapping up her essay and putting it into her backpack, she grinned thankfully at her brother, \"Thanks again, Hale. You're honestly the best big brother ever!\" Hale smirked his trademark smirk. \"No prob. Hey, we promised the gang we would meet up at Looney Tune Land if you finished up early. You ready to roll?\" Kari smiled, \"Sure! Even better, why don't we do another award-winning performance? It'll be a blast!\" Hale nodded as he grabbed his guitar. \"I was thinking the same thing. Grab your stuff, Kari. We're leaving for another debut on stage!\" Both young adults laughed gleefully as they grabbed their instruments. Kari glanced down at her bracelet that Nawt made for her years ago, a twinkle in her eye. ' Speaking of which, I wonder how Nawt's doing since I've been busy with my studies as of late..? Guess I'm about to find out!' , she thought as both she and her brother aimed out the door in a heartbeat, with Hale dialing a couple numbers down on his phone.[Chapter 2] So I'm back with another chapter here for you all! *crickets chirping in the background* Aaaaanyway, this will be chapter two of my new 'Space Jam' fanfic. I own nothing of the sort, except for the Rodgers siblings, Lexi, Maddie, Mika, and Marie. Yep. All rights go to Warner Bros., MonstarzGirl for her character Nada, and Icon for Hire for their song \"Theater\". Third Person POV: \"Oi! What's taking you bunch?! We're gonna be late!\", a thundering voice boomed throughout the entire mansion as Pound shouted for his alien teammates to hurry up. Blanko was struggling to put on a pair of his sneakers and succeeded before falling down the stairs in a tumbleweed fashion, landing face first with his long legs dangling in the air. He lifted his head up and with a goofy grin, gave a thumbs-up. Pound shook his head in disbelief, ' Can't believe I actually LIVE with these guys. They're worse than women in terms of getting ready and out-the-door!' Moments later, Bang came sliding down the polished wood railing of the stairs, wearing a black leather jacket with the ACDC logo on the back of it, while holding a box of chocolate, flowers, and a green teddy bear with the same jacket that he's wearing. \"I'm ready!\", he shouted, pumping his fist in the air with assertion. Pound and Blanko stared at him with blank looks on their faces. Pound slapped his hand on his forehead before sliding it down his face. \"Lord, give me strength..\", he mumbled to himself. Blanko grinned at his green companion, \"Nice flowers. Cute bear too. Is that for Maddie?\" Bang snorted with sarcasm, \"Nah, it's for the tooth fairy. Of course it's for Maddie! No fair that I'm left out from being extravagant with my lady!\" Pound raised a brow. \"What do you mean by that? I gave Mika some flowers. That's not extravagant..\" Blanko bit his lip. \"Yeah, and I got Nada some 'Forget-Me-Nots', and a blueberry muffin. So what do you mean by extravagant?\" Bang gawked at them then started to sweat bullets. Pound gave a stern look. \"Bang, it looks like you're going to sweep her off her feet, and it ain't Valentines yet!\" Bang looked down at the gifts he was holding then looked back up at his friends. \"Well, then I'll get more for her on Valentines!\" Blanko and Pound stared at him with dumbfound expressions. A few moments later, they heard what sounded like a crashing sound coming from upstairs. Bupkus ran out of his room, looking completely oblivious and stupefied. \"Are we late?!\" Pound growled at him. \"We will be late if you and Nawt don't hurry your sorry behinds ASAP!\" Bupkus nodded his head. \"I'll go get Nawt. Be back in two shakes!\" He sped off to the direction of Nawt's bedroom, wondering what's taking him so long. Upon knocking on his red friend's door, his ear perked up at Nawt's voice sounding troubled. Getting the feel that his friend is in some kind of turmoil, he opened up the door. \"Hey. What's holding ya? Kari and Hale are on their way on over!\" Nawt jerked quickly upon Bupkus entering his bedroom and threw some cloth over his desk, turning around quickly with a nervous smile. \"Oh! Hey, Bupkus! Just, uh, finishing up and getting ready!\" Bupkus looked at him with a mix of concern and amusement, and decided to close the bedroom door behind him. \"Alright, smart guy. I know you're hiding something. Spill!\" Nawt stammered, \"I-I have no idea-\" Bupkus cut him off with a short laugh. \"Come on, man! You're always clamped up here, tinkering away at whatever! Lemme guess, it's another gift for Kari, right?\" Nawt's eyes seemed like they were going to roll on out of his skull, then he shrunk back in embarrassment. \"How did you know?\" Bupkus snickered in an amused manner. \"Man, you are just crazy about her! Every time there's something that you want to do for her, you take your time and close up from everything else. So what ya got there, huh?\" The purple alien nodded his head at the cloth covering the table behind his friend. Nawt bit his lip and let out a sigh. He glanced over at Bupkus in a serious manner, catching him off guard. \"Swear you won't tell a soul? Not even her brother?\" Bupkus flinched slightly before nodding his head in compliance. \"Swear on my mother's grave, man. But wait, you seriously don't want Hale to know? Now why-?\" Before Bupkus could finish up his sentence, Nawt lifted up the cover and showed him what he was working on. Bupkus had a confused look before looking over what was on the desk and then it registered. \"Woah…\" Nawt looked down at the table too, a mixture of nervousness, excitement, and uncertainty in his eyes. \"Yeah.\" \"So that's why you've been locked up here as of late! But, Nawt.. You're actually serious about this?\" The red alien nodded without looking at his muscular friend, \"Yes. I am.\" Bupkus ogled his eyes widely at him and whistled, \"You sound so certain! Well damn, son! I applaud you and all, but then that just leaves one thing.. When are you gonna ask her?\" Nawt inhaled a deep breath before letting it out. \"That… I still don't know. I still have a lot of work to do on this and cause of that, I can't say when.\" Bupkus raised a brow, knowing that's not all. \"But that's not only it, is it?\" He only got silence from the red alien, and then continued. \"You don't want Hale to know cause of his hot headed temper and how he is with his sister. Especially now, that you are seeing her almost all the time and are completely inseparable. \" Nawt silently nodded his head. \"He's still uneasy about us.\" Bupkus growled, \"Man, I know the kid is cool and all, but he can't interfere with what makes both you and Kari happy. Doesn't matter if he's her brother or not, this business is between you and her. He may have his opinions, but he's not the boss around here in this matter.\" Nawt turned around and looked up at Bupkus, surprise etched on his features. Bupkus crossed his arms and stated firmly. \"If you want to ask her to marry you, that's your guys' call. Not his.\" A moment passed before Nawt spoke, \"I know, but it makes it tougher when you have one member of the group who's more than likely to oppose the idea. This isn't only based off of assumptions either. Whenever I do hang out with her and he's there, Hale is pestering her with questions. Not as bad as it was years back, but still.\" Bupkus held his tongue, seeing where Nawt is going with this. \"Alright. I won't tell a soul like I said, but you will have to confront him about it yourself and give him the facts, sooner or later. And I don't mean in an aggressive manner. Kari will have to do the same, too.\" Nawt was silent for a couple moments before nodding his head and covering up the table with the cloth. Bupkus glanced over at the alarm clock before letting out a shrill cry. \"Oh damn! We're running late!\" Nawt jerked his head to the clock and gasped. \"Crap! You're right! Let's go!\" Both Monstars bolted out the door, slamming it shut behind them as they raced down the stairs towards the front door. Blanko, Bang, and Pound were already half way to the amphitheater on their way to meet the Looney Tunes, the girls, and the Rodgers siblings. Pound growled under his breath in aggravation. \"What the hell was taking them so long?!\" Blanko nervously piped up, \"Maybe they forgot to take the trash out?\" Pound snarled at the blue alien, \"The trash was already taken out this morning, Blanko. If they don't show up, I know who's not gonna be happy about it. Am I right, Bang?\" Bang was too occupied with the gifts for Maddie that he had in his arms to even notice. Pound let out a sound of agitation as he rolled his eyes, while Blanko gazed back momentarily behind them. \"I sure hope everything's alright and that they make it.\" Meanwhile, at the amphitheater, Kari and Hale were setting up their equipment on the stage, while the Looney Tunes were taking their seats. On their way to Looney Tune Land, the siblings decided to pick up their cousin Marie from their aunt's so she can join them in their festivities as well. Marie was now a very social young girl, almost at the peak of turning five years old. \"Hey, when's Kitty coming? I thought he would be here.\" The young child said in a worried voice. Hale put the finishing touches on his guitar and looked at his cousin with a grin. \"Don't worry, Marie. He'll show up, along with the other Monstars.\" Kari nodded, though she wouldn't admit that she's a little concerned herself. She finished adjusting the mic and straightened herself up. Nada set up her equipment and got her synthesizer ready when she received a text on her cell. She pulled out her phone and smiled, \"It's Blanko. He says they're on their way, although Bupkus and Nawt got held back for some reason or another.\" Lexi crossed her arms while holding drumsticks in each hand. \"Now why would they be late? Bupkus better have some serious explaining to do. We're about to start our show!\" Mika and Maddie were sitting among the audience, indicating that they will be spectators for the entire performance like the others. Pound, Blanko, and Bang finally arrived and made their way to the front, greeting the group and gave friendly hellos to the Tunes. Mika hugged her beau and noticed his stiff look. \"Is something wrong?\" Pound growled. \"No, though Bupkus and Nawt are taking their sweet time getting here.\" They turned around as they heard Maddie squeal right next to them as she received the gifts Bang got for her. She placed them down momentarily to bear hug the big green brute and pecked him on the cheek, causing him to blush like a tomato. Nada and Blanko exchanged warm greetings with one another, pecking each other on the lips. Kari approached Blanko with light concern with Lexi, Hale and Marie in tow. \"Hey, Blanko. Where are Bupkus and Nawt?\" Suddenly, the ground slightly shook as thundering footsteps were heard making their way to the front of the stage. In front of them appeared Nawt and Bupkus, struggling to catch their breaths as they were sweating profusely like they just ran a marathon. Lexi waved her hand towards them. \"And there they are! Where were you guys?\" Bupkus gave a wry smile at his girlfriend, \"Hey, babe. Sorry we took a while. Nawt forgot to take the trash out.\" Nawt gave a dirty look at Bupkus, but nodded in agreement to his statement. Blanko looked back at Pound. \"Told ya!\" Pound threw his large hands up in the air, as if flipping an invisible table. Kari smiled and sauntered up to her boyfriend, giving him a big hug and a kiss. Nawt returned the gesture with gusto, a smile brought up to his face while doing so. Hale huffed about it, but stayed quiet. Bupkus raised a brow over at the spiky haired wonder. \"Hey! Bobby Fisher! Where's your woman at?\" Hale shot a look at Bupkus. \"She couldn't make it. Elise said that she had to help her mom at the animal shelter. Apparently they got a couple of dogs getting adopted, so her mom needed her to give a helping hand.\" Lexi smiled, \"Aw. That's sweet of her.\" Nawt looked over at her. \"Ain't she always the sweet one, though?\" Marie ran up to Bupkus and jumped on him, embracing him with glee. \"Kitty! I thought you wouldn't come!\" Bupkus gave out a merry laugh and picked up the toddler, giving her a gentle hug and a kiss on her chubby cheek. \"I wouldn't think about missing out on seeing my beautiful women!\" Marie giggled and squealed as Bupkus tickled her sides, with Lexi smiling warmly at the sight. She tilted towards Kari and whispered, \"It's moments like these that make me fall in love with the big guy all over again. I swear, he'd make a wonderful dad.\" Kari couldn't help but smile at that. \"Yeah, he would. You got lucky, Lexi.\" Lexi gently punched the auburn haired girl on the arm. \"Ow! What's that for?\" Kari gave a baffled look as the blonde whispered again. \"You bimbo! You're just as lucky as I am! Don't talk nonsense unless you're a part of it!\" The girls both giggled at the comment, knowing that it was a fact on how lucky they all were. Hale cleared his throat, gaining their attention. \"I hate to burst the moment for you all, but we got a show to start! We can chat right after once we head on over to Monstar Manor, what ya say?\" Everyone nodded and cheered in agreement, as Kari, Hale, Lexi, and Nada got on stage with their music equipment set up and ready to go. Bupkus took his seat while holding on to Marie, with Nawt sitting next to him, followed by Blanko, Bang, Maddie, Mika and Pound. As the overture proceeded, the strums of the guitars rang throughout, with the beat of the drums and the tune following out. Kari, taking point on vocals, then sang out. \" My life is a musical I know how to put on a pretty pathetic show I hide backstage Keep the curtains closed ' Cause I'm scared, I'm scared I'm getting pretty good at feeding them the lines they like But I don't recognize the girl I face each night I can compromise till I'm convinced It's right What happened to the girl who can overlook the world? She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine? ' Cause that never worked for me I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line Like \"this is it!\" They say all the world's a stage Rewriting your identity is all the rage Well next act please, I'd like a change I don't really like pretending This way What happened to the girl who can overlook the world? She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine? ' Cause that never worked for me I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line Like \"this is it!\" I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line Like \"this is it!\" And the sad thing is we're all in on the action We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction You play your part I'll be playing with matches And if you'd like a show, you can follow the ashes I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line Like \"this is it!\" I'm gonna burn this theater down and pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line Like…. \"THIS IS IIIIIIIIT!\" The guitars came to a crashing finish, along with Lexi's drumming, with Kari giving a faint vocal \"ah\". Afterwards, the entire stage burst into a round of applause and cheers. The Tunes were nuts about the entire spectacle and the Monstars as well. Bang and Maddie gave their hoots and hollers, while Pound and Mika whistled and clapped. Blanko gave a huge smile and clapped, making Nada flush. Marie was hosted up and placed on Bupkus' shoulders, as the both of them cheered. Lexi smiled at the both of them, her pride swelling slightly. Nawt smiled, feeling once again a boost of confidence and understanding from that song. 'Kari, you sure know how to sing what's in my heart and mind.' Kari smiled brightly, holding Hale's hand as they took a bow in front of the entire crowd. Getting down from stage, Kari and Nawt walked up to each other, with each side in tow behind them. \"Let's head on over to your guys' place. That way, we can chat and be merry!\", the auburn haired girl joked. Everyone gave out a \"yeah\" and \"let's go\", as they packed up their equipment and got ready to head on over to the Monstars' domain. As they were ready to take their leave, Lexi tugged on Bupkus' left arm, leaving him holding on to Marie with his right. The tanned blonde looked at her beau with level eyes. \"You still have some explaining to do as to why you guys were running late. Literally.\" Bupkus gulped inaudibly, knowing that there was no getting around Lexi. He slowly relaxed and gave in. \"Alright, I'll tell ya. But I'll tell you as soon as we get to the house. You're not gonna believe it..\".[Chapter 3] Hello again! I am back with another chapter for 'Revolution'! So far, this seems pretty good and everyone's all at the edge, wondering \"Is she going to say 'yes'?\" Wait no more! I can't say what's going to be here, so I'll let you read to find out. I own only my OCs. Kari's POV: We were on our way over to Monstar Manor just after we finished up our performance. I could tell Hale was peeved about Elise not being able to come, but for some reason, it seemed like he was upset about something else other than the fact that his girlfriend couldn't tag along for our show. Just a couple months after we beat Swackhammer and I got into the flow of spending more time with Nawt, Hale has been acting more paranoid that he leads on to be. I mean, sure, he said he trusts Nawt and knows that he wouldn't do anything of the sort that may seem like an advantage, but I still feel like he's not trusting him as much as he said he did. ' Hale, what's gotten into you? Why is it that you don't seem to still fully trust Nawt?' My thoughts were interrupted as we finally came to a halt in front of the Monstar's domain. Pound made his way around the crowd towards the front door. \"Lemme get that open for y'all.\" He unlocked the double doors, allowing us to make our entry. We entered in first, followed by the Tunes, and then the Monstars. Pound and Mika decided to go to the kitchen to start preparing a nice meal for everyone, with Bugs and Lola tagging along with them. Bang and Maddie were still on cloud nine as they both opted to go up to his room for the time being until the food was ready, which most likely will be them ending up playing more COD and Battlefield. Blanko and Nada vouched on getting some fresh vegetables from Blanko's garden in the backyard, along with some fruit for a nice fruit salad. Daffy, Sylvester, Granny, Witch Hazel, and Foghorn made themselves at home by sitting on the sofa and watch some television. Lexi, Bupkus, Marie, Wile, Yosemite, Elmer, Porky, and Pepe sat in the living room as they listened to some of Bupkus' jokes, which most of them were pretty funny. I sat down with Nawt and Hale right across from them, with Nawt placing his arm around my shoulders. I felt a slight shiver of delight shoot down my spine, bringing a pink tinge to my cheeks. Hale had a stern look at the corner of his eye, but his attention soon snapped over to Bupkus as he approached him with Marie. \"Hey, Hale. Could you hold on to Marie for a short bit? I need to talk to Lexi about something. She's still upset about us arriving late and demands her explanation.\" Hale nodded and took the small child. \"Sure thing. Good luck with that, man.\" Marie gave a pout at Bupkus. \"You better be back soon, kitty!\" Bupkus rumbled out a chuckle. \"I will, sweetie. Just gotta tell Lexi what happened this morning. It'll only take a few minutes.\" Bupkus then looked over at me and Nawt and gave us a wink along with a thumbs up. I gave a confused look and glanced over at Nawt, who seemed a brighter red than usual and with a look that almost resembled embarrassment and something else. Marie let herself down as Bupkus and Lexi made their way to a separate room, and she turned to face Hale. \"Hale, can you show me some basketball moves? I wanna learn how to play like you and Kari! Pretty please?!\" Hale gave a flabbergasted look then glanced at me, as if asking for help. I laughed merrily, \"Go on, Hale! She wants you to teach her. I'm sure you can spare her a move or two.\" My brother shot me a look and muttered under his breath, \"Traitor.\" He got up in defeat, much to mine and Nawt's surprise, making a giddy Marie squeal happily. \"Yay! Hale's gonna teach me some basketball!\" The Tunes in the living room got up and joined with Hale and Marie. \"Mind if we play too?\", Elmer asked contently. Hale gave them a blank look for a moment before sighing, a wry smile appearing on his face. \"Sure, why not? It will be easier to teach her that way, too.\" The group gave a cheer as they all started making their way out the back sliding door. Hale gave me one last look, as if to say \"Don't even think about it\". I stuck my tongue out at him in defiance and frowned. Once they all were outside and the sliding door was closed, I gave out an exasperated sigh. \"Geez! Sometimes Hale makes it hard to breathe the same air! Why is he acting like this?\" Nawt rubbed my back gently to soothe me. \"It's alright, sweetheart. I guess he's just still in his 'big brother' mode.\" I frowned sadly. \"Yeah, but he can't keep treating me like a baby forever. I'm able to handle myself just fine. It's not like he always needs to be there wherever I am, especially when I'm with you.\" I heard him chuckle out lightly, causing me to lift my head up and look at him in curiosity. \"What's so funny?\" He gave me a wry smile of his own and replied, \"Guys at his age are still immature. True, I have my own moments, but I think he's just still filling in the gaps. I'm sure that someday Hale will understand that his beloved sibling doesn't need to be babysat constantly and will come to terms with us being together without worry.\" I gave out a sigh and placed my head on top of his shoulder. \"I sure hope you're right. Goodness, I wish Elise was here. She could definitely place him in a more level state of mind.\" Nawt laughed heartily and brought his arm snug around me. \"I doubt 'level' is the proper word to use when it comes to him being with her, you know that Kari.\" I looked up at him. \"What do you mean?\" Nawt lowered his face closer to mine and whispered, \" She makes him feel the same way I feel about you. \" I couldn't help but blush at that comment, and I gently punched him on his side. \"Stop. We can't do that here.. the others might see..\", I said bashfully, unable to hide the red blood rush that is now coloring my face. Nawt brought me closer to his muscular frame and breathed down my ear, making me blush even more to the point that the room felt like its spinning! \"Well, then we can go to another room… Everyone else dispersed, so why not us?\" I bit back on any urge of a sigh or even a breath of any sort. I shyly gazed up and met my eyes with his. Nawt's stare was intense that it felt like he was burning holes into me! He then bent down and placed butterfly kisses on my neck. \"Oh! That's… that's just not fair..!\" I cried lightly. I screwed my eyes shut as I tried to keep myself from squealing in delight. 'That's not fair at all! This is entrapment, this is seduction, this is… HELL-O!' My eyes shot wide open as his left hand trailed down my thigh and went to the underside of it, while the other slid under my shirt and rested in between the base of my ribs. I felt like I was about to explode from joy, pleasure, and embarrassment of it all. Gathering some sense, I gently pushed him up and while at it, taking in a couple of deep breaths. \"Nawt.. upstairs.. now..\", I said shakily, still feeling light-headed. He smiled gently at me and picked me up bridal style in his arms. I clutched onto his jersey as we made our way upstairs and down the hall into his room. Once in there, he placed me on his bed then went to shut the door behind him securely. I propped myself onto my elbows as he made his way over to me, kicking off his shoes and crawling onto the bed next to me. Nawt gazed at me lovingly, bringing up a long red finger and tracing it on the contours of my face. Adjusting his body, he brought himself closer to me and I to him. Flashing a heartfelt smile, he whispered, his lips a few centimeters away from mine. \" Je t'aime, amour.\" Within seconds, our lips joined in sweet bliss and rapture. I took a hold of his jersey and pulled him forward, bringing his body onto mine. I felt his hands wander my back to my sides, and from there they slid under my shirt. I moaned gently into his mouth, which caused him to press his lips harder into mine, a deep growl emanating from his chest. My head was certainly spinning for sure now. I was lost from my senses as I felt Nawt shift his weight even more and nestled himself in between my legs. 'Crap! If Hale comes up and finds us like this, then we won't hear the end of it!' I pulled apart from him briefly and breathed out the best I could in some sense. \"Nawt.. wait. We should stop. What if Hale comes up and sees us like this?\" Nawt looked down at me and after a moment, dove down and started trailing kisses from my jaw to my neck to my collar bone. \"Ah! Nawt! Wai- Oooh!\" I felt his warm tongue sliding on my collar bone, and then brought his lips up to the base of my neck and bit down gently. His hands glided up my bare back and slid further under my training bra. \"He won't.\", he breathed raggedly, shifting his whole being further onto me. I let out a cry, which was soon drowned by his lips capturing mine once more. I felt his hips beginning to grind into mine and from there, I lost all my senses completely. I grabbed a hold of his jersey and attempted to pull it off from him. Nawt took note of what I was doing and lifted himself off from me for a moment. He smiled and took off his top, revealing his muscle bound torso. 'Oh my goodness, he is just perfect! God, I love him.' , I thought to myself as he took ahold of my hand and pulled me up onto my knees with him. Wrapping his arms around me, he flashed a devilish grin with mischief dancing in the light of his eyes. \"So I see. You're such a vixen, Kari. Now let me try…\" Before we could get any further, a knock was heard on Nawt's bedroom door, followed by the sound of Bupkus' frantic voice. \"You guys better get out of there soon!\" I noticed that Bupkus sounded scared and so did Nawt. We got off the bed, Nawt putting back on his shirt and shoes as well. I fixed my disheveled self and went up to the door and opened it. \"Bupkus? What's wrong? Is everything ok?\" Bupkus glanced down and studied me before taking a breath. \"Were you guys doing what I think you were?\" I flushed mildly at his comment, not knowing what to say. Nawt came up from behind me, looking frustrated and cranky. \"No, Bupkus. We weren't. Now what's the problem?\" Bupkus gave out a huge sigh of relief. \"Thank goodness. Hale just finished playing with Marie a couple minutes ago and started acting up because you two disappeared. If you don't get your butts down there, he's gonna turn the whole house upside down!\" I gave out a huff and took a hold of Nawt's hand. \"Well, we're going down now, so his royal highness can calm his tooters down. Let's go, Nawt.\" Nawt followed me as we went down the hall and towards the stairs. Bupkus tailed right behind us, though Nawt looked back at him then stopped as we reached the top of the stairs. I turned around to see what's keeping him. \"Hey, what's up?\" Nawt looked over and me and smiled. \"You go on ahead. I'm gonna check something with Bupkus. It's just guy talk.\" I looked at him in confusion for a moment then nodded, smiling back. \"Okay, but be quick. I certainly don't want to deal with Hale for long.\" With that I took my leave down the stairs. Nawt's POV: I waved off to Kari as she went down the stairs. As soon as she was gone, I cursed silently to myself. 'Dammit! Why does this ALWAYS happen whenever we get some time to ourselves?! It's like Hale is the ultimate security bug or something! I know he means well for his sister, but come on!' I turned to Bupkus, who was shuffling his feet around nervously. I raised a brow, his behavior being completely strange. \"What's wrong with you?\" Bupkus stood at attention and chuckled weakly, \"Well, you see… Lexi asked why we took so long… and so I…\" I gawked at him, knowing what he did. \"You told her, didn't you?\" Bupkus threw his hands up in defense. \"Oy! She's able to keep a tight lid about it. The problem isn't her though...\" I felt my stomach do a couple flip flops, and not in a good way. I stared at him with a scared look etched on my face. \"Go on…\" Bupkus looked down at me with a nervous look. \"Someone eavesdropped on me and Lexi talking about it.\" If there was a time that I was borderline between flipping tables and trying to remain calm, then this was one of those times, and a big one at that. \"Who heard?\" Bupkus swallowed hard. \"Pound. He heard it all.\"[Chapter 4] I am finally back with another chapter for 'Space Jam – Revolution'! A lot has been occurring as of late during the summer break and I now have an opportunity to catch up on work that needs to done, in terms of story writing! I only own what is rightfully mine. MonstarzGirl owns Nada Sampson and The Looney Tunes and the Monstars are rightfully owned by Warner Brothers. Now to continue where we left off, shall we? Pound's POV: I started gathering ingredients from the spice cabinets as Mika and I started getting preparations done for a nice relaxing lunch for us all. My darlin' gal started taking out some sausage and carrots out for a delicious gumbo, humming the tune of the song that Kari finished performing earlier today at the amphitheater. I smiled while glancing down at her affectionately. \"You got quite the lovely voice there, boo. Perhaps you should sing a tune sometime.\" Mika let out a hearty, girlish laugh. \"Babe, you know that I get stage fright easily. I can't even face a crowd even to save my life! Nah, I prefer taking photos and editing them. That's my magic talent for creativity.\" I set down some of the spices and walked over to her, placing my huge hands on her dainty shoulders. \"Baby, you're talent is amazing. But I think you can do it. Just take a look at Kari and Hale: they're succeeded in learning how to dance and they couldn't dance for jack! Heck, look at me! I learned how to cook and play the cello!\" Mika turned around and gawked at me before letting out a fit of giggles, \"When did you learn to play the cello, of all things?!\" I blushed slightly and averted my eyes to the spices that remain on the countertop. \"Well, I, uh, I asked Kari and Elise for some lessons on how to play an instrument, and um, I learned to play the cello… So that way, uh, I.. I can impress you.\" I glanced back at her nervously, only to see her with a lovely smile on her beautiful face and her bright eyes twinkling back at me. \"Aww. You always impress me, big boy. Alright, you win.\" I gawked down at Mika in confusion. \"Huh?\" She placed her hands on her hips and had her plump lips in a pout. \"Don't 'huh' me, suguh. I said I'll give it a shot at singing the next time the opportunity comes. My boo learned to play the cello and is now a music wonder, but not me? Nuh-uh. Nope. I'm gonna do my share and learn something myself too!\" I cracked a huge grin and lifted my woman up in a hug. \"That's my girl! That's the fire I was lookin' for! I just know you'll knock 'em dead!\" She wrapped her arms around me and laughed her wonderful laugh, \"Thank you, baby.\" We pulled apart and kissed one another on the lips. ' I can see why Nawt was nuts about his girl. This woman's a total wonder!' After pulling apart and settling her down, my ears picked up a couple voices in the next room closest to the kitchen. The voices I came to recognize as belonging to both Lexi and Bupkus. Mika heard them too and gave a saucy smirk. \"I guess Lexi still isn't gonna let her beau off the hook that easily. Poor soul. She's a tough cookie to shake.\" I let out a deep chuckle. \"Well, that's what he gets for taking his precious time getting on over to the show! Shame that Kari ain't giving Nawt the same trea—\" I was broken off as both Mika and I jumped at what sounded like Lexi shrieking. Exchanging a quick glance over at Mika then back to the entrance of the other room, I stealthily sauntered my way over to hear what the commotion was all about. I heard Mika right behind me whispering harshly, \"Pound! Get back here!\" I ignored her with a small smile and leaned up against the wall, trying not to get noticed. Mika stood next to me with a scowl, but then became quiet and curious when we heard Bupkus speaking up, \"Shh! Quiet, babe! No one can know about this!\" I raised a brow and glanced momentarily at Mika, who only shrugged before we turned our attention back to the two. Lexi piped up in a whisper, her voice laced with disbelief and excitement, \"So wait! Hold up! Nawt is planning what now?\" ' Oh, great. Why am I not surprised? Nawt's always planning something. Bet twenty bucks it has to do with Kari too.' Bupkus spoke up quietly, \"He's planning this huge thing for Kari. I'm telling you, he's serious about it!\" ' Bingo. Now just what does he mean by huge? And what does he mean that Nawt's serious about it? What in the world is he talking about?' Mika leaned in closer, her curiosity growing by the minute just as much as mine. \"So what exactly is it? I mean, I know you say it's the 'ultimate vow', but you have yet to tell me what it is!\", Lexi fumed. Mika's eyes were growing wide while mine were already boggling out of my head. ' What in the Hans Christian Anderson does THAT mean?! Ultimate vow? Hol' up! This is something I gotta hear!' I heard Bupkus' nervous voice pick up, which can either mean that it's a bad thing and they don't want me to know about it, or something else. But I can definitely say that what was going to be said, I will most likely not be happy. \"Well, he plans to.. uh…\", he stumbled on his words, making the tension in the air grow more than necessary. I was so close to charging in there and squeeze the words out of him as Mika quickly grabbed my arm and rooted me in place. Lexi huffed and almost shouted \"Come on, Bupkus! Just what was it that kept you and Nawt so busy that you took so long? What is he planning that you're helping him out with?\" I rolled my eyes and mentally slapped myself, 'For the love of all that is looney, just say it, man!' Finally, Bupkus spoke up. \"I'm sorry for being late! Really! I was helping him out with a ring he was making for her. A wedding ring!\" There was a silence in the now stagnant air as none of us made a sound or spoke a word. Mika's eyes and mouth were all wide open in shock, while I was standing there next to her completely stupefied. '.. What? Did he just say a wedding ring..? Now just who-?' \"Nawt plans to propose to Kari and ask for her hand in marriage.\", Bupkus said flat out. \"SAY WHAT NOW?!\", I hollered in total astonishment. After those words fell from my mouth, the next thing I knew I was toppling over with Mika tumbling over alongside me. We both landed on the floor with a now shocked and very surprised looking Bupkus and Lexi gawking down at us. There was an exchange of uncomfortable stares and silences before Bupkus gave a nervous wheeze and choked up some words, \"H-hey there, Pound! Haha. What- what did you hear?\" I continued staring with a dumbstruck look, then gave a serious growl \"Everything.\" Mika got up from me and brushed up her skirt before turning her attention to Lexi. \"Girl, is this true?\" Lexi shrugged and gestured to her boyfriend. \"Don't look at me! I'm just as surprised as you are! Bupkus, are you being serious about all this?\" Bupkus waved his hands in defense. \"It's true! Ask Nawt! He'll tell you the facts straight up!\" I got up, my voice rumbling in disbelief, \"Oh, you can bet your butt I'll be asking him! Just what is he thinking?!\" Mika turned to face me, \"Pound! That's enough!\" I looked at her in surprise. \"Mika, how can you expect me to just let this be? You do realize that—\" \"That he loves Kari so much that he's willing to spend his life with her. Pound, you can't keep Nawt on a leash like a dog forever. You know as much as I do that Nawt cares deeply for Kari, just as much as she loves and cares for him.\", she told me soothingly. I couldn't believe my ears, but then again, I guess this has been going about all day so far. I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply, then released my breath. 'Mika's right. I've been way too uptight with him. I should know better by now. Guess I need to live and let live more than just preaching about it while acting so against it. However..' \"There's just one problem.\", I said in a low voice so only they could hear. Mika raised her brows. \"And what would that be?\" Just then, we heard Hale's voice raising up in agitation, clearly due to the whereabouts of his sister and Nawt. I pointed one huge orange finger in the direction of the voice. \" That.\" I then turned to Bupkus and gave out my order. \"Bupkus, go get those two. I bet ya they're upstairs doing only God knows what, so get them in action and tell them that Hale's on the move. Also..\" Bupkus swallowed hard, \"Also..?\" I sighed and mellowed slightly, \"I need you to bring Nawt downstairs. We will need to have a matter-of-fact conversation about all this.. 'wedding' stuff.\" Before Mika could scold me even further, I added, \"If he's gonna go through with this, I want him to at least know that I have some say so as well, as his friend.\" Bupkus gave me a confused look, only for me to growl at him in annoyance. \"Well, get going! The last thing we need is pyro over there finding out about this himself!\" With a quick nod, Bupkus rushed away and up the stairs. Mika and Lexi glanced up at me with raised eyebrows. \"So you're not going to kill him?\", the blonde inquired. I shook my head. \"Nah. But I need to be clear on a couple of things with him. We also need to discuss about what to do with the ' problem ' that I think is more of a worry than I am.\" I motioned my head over to where Hale was at, emphasizing my point. The girls looked over past me then nodded in agreement. Mika rubbed her temples with her left forefinger and middle finger. \"Yeah, he's going to be the real tough one, alright. So what's the plan?\" Lexi bit her bottom lip, \"Perhaps we should ask Bugs?\" I gawked down at the tanned girl before me, with Mika giving her an equally disturbed expression. \"You're joking, right?\" Lexi glared at us both, causing us to shrink back. \"Look, I know it may mean the Tunes possibly finding out about it, but it's the one option we have to find advice that won't lead us to have our heads end up on a platter at the mercy of a strict brother.\" Knowing she makes a point, we really didn't have much of a choice. I sighed exasperatedly, willing to go along with the idea. ' Now let's hope we can keep Hale from finding out… At least, for now…\"[Chapter 5] Here we go with another chapter for 'Revolution'! I will try to make this one a little longer and a bit more interesting. Bear with me, people! I only own my OC's. Disclaimer has been stated. Here we go! Third Person POV: It didn't take long for Kari to arrive into the living room area, where her brother was making a fuss about hers and Nawt's whereabouts. As Hale was about to call out for his sibling, he spotted her at the corner of his eye and turned to face her with a scornful frown. \"There you are! Just where the heck did you go?! You better not have been doing anything that you shouldn't be!\", he said sternly, his frown growing bigger. Kari rolled her eyes in obvious annoyance. \"Of course not, Hale! Honestly, you need to lighten up!\" Marie, who was standing next to Hale, shuffled her feet nervously at the tension between the two older cousins. Bugs, Daffy, Lola, Wile, and some of the other Tunes who picked up on the commotion came into the living room as well. \"Say docs, what's all the ruckus about?\", the grey hare asked curiously. Wile then noticed Marie looking uncomfortable and pulled over the five year old gently by the hand. Daffy also noticed and raised a brow. \"What's up, Marie?\" Marie glanced up at the Tunes then back at her cousins. \"I think Hale and Kari are mad at each other..\" Hale snapped down at his young cousin. \"I'm not mad!\" Kari scolded her brother for his aggressive response. \"Don't snap off at Marie! It's not her fault that you've been acting so angry as of late.\" Bugs stepped in between the two young adults and raised his paws up. \"Ok, break it up, you two! This is no way to act around a kid! If you need to talk things out, why not do so outside?\" Kari nodded at Bugs in agreement. \"I agree with you, Bugs. Hale, let's go outside and discuss this.\" Still fuming, Hale followed his sister out the screen door and into the backyard. Bugs scratched his head in confusion as the feuding brother and sister walked out and closed the door securely behind them. At the same moment, Nawt, Bupkus, Mika, Lexi, and Pound entered the living room area. Nawt looked at the Tunes and the child before them. \"Hey, Bugs. What happened? Where's Kari and Hale?\" Daffy turned around to face the red Monstar. \"Lookths like they got into a fight and went outsthide to disthcuss things.\" \"Who got into a fight now?\" Everyone turned towards the back of the room to see Bang, Blanko, Nada and Maddie now all present with the rest of them. Pound growled, \"Kari and Hale seem to have gotten into an argument. But right now, I think it's best that we let those two settle whatever they have between them alone. Nawt, we need to talk, and \"I think everyone has the right to know what's going on.\" Nawt snapped his attention back over at Pound. His red skin started sweating profusely as he felt the eyes of every single being in the room right on him. \"Y-yeah? What is it, Pound?\" The large orange Monstar stepped up with a serious look. \"So tell us, what's this about a 'marriage'?\" Kari and Hale walked through the vegetable patch and fruit trees until they came upon the gazebo near Blanko's greenhouse. Once there, the two siblings faced one another with a stubborn glare. Kari crossed her arms, wanting to get to the bottom of this long standing feud once and for all. Hale shoved his hands into his pockets, lowering his face slightly, but keeping his gaze firmly on his sister. \"So why are we even here? I told you, I'm not-\" \"Oh cut the crap, Hale! This has been going on for too long! Just what is it with you?!\" \"Excuse me?!\" Kari placed her hands on her hips angrily. \"Yes, excuse you! You have been acting like a jerk every time I try to spend time with Nawt! Hale, you know we'd never do anything that would be knowingly wrong, but you've got to understand that I'm not a little kid anymore that constantly needs to have her older brother baby-sitting her wherever I go or who I'm with, particularly my own boyfriend!\" Hale clenched his jaw before responding back harshly. \"Me? Being a jerk?! Kari, I only want to be sure you're safe! As for being a little kid, yeah, we're both not kids anymore, but that doesn't change that I'm your older brother just trying to be there for his younger sister! I only want what's best for you, don't you see that?!\" Kari fumed back, becoming more frustrated, \"Being my older brother doesn't mean always, no- constantly in my business and with whom I'm in company with! I can't always be under your wing and I certainly won't be held back on a leash like some puppy for the rest of my life, especially by you! \" Hale's eyes grew wide in shock and his mouth left agape. After a few moments, Kari finally realized what she said and her eyes grew wide as well. 'Oh, no. What did I just say?!' With a grimace, Hale said in a low voice, \"Fine.\" The auburn haired girl stammered, \"W-wait, Hale. I-\" \"Save it, Hikari. If you want to be left alone, then fine.\" The older sibling started making his way, Kari tried to stop him. \"H-hold on! Big bro-!\" As she tried to grab his hand, he pulled away and briefly turned to face her, anger evident on his features but pain in his eyes. \" WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER?! PERHAPS IF I WERE TO JUST DISAPPEAR, THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU ANYMORE!\" In that single moment, time felt as though it came to a sudden halt to Hikari. Her eyes were wide as she stared at her brother, her breath coming out in shuddering gasps. \"D-don't say that, Hale! You're just acting like a brat now!\" Hale laughed a crude laugh. \"Oh, I'M the brat?! Says the one who thinks she's better than the rest and is the superstar!\" Now she felt hurt, as she felt her eyes beginning to sting and water. \"That's not true! I-\" He cut her off again, and what words fell next from his lips would break what's left of her composure. \"Forget it! Why don't you just kiss off and die?!\" Within the next few seconds, a loud smacking sound echoed through the air as a hand slapped him across the face. Nada stood in between the two siblings, her bright leafy green eyes filled with disappointment and disgust toward the pyro male. \"That's going too far, Hale! She's your sister! Kari doesn't deserve to be treated that way!\" Not too from the gazebo stood all the Tunes, Monstars, and the remaining girls, as they held disappointed and shocked looks at the display. Blanko was stunned at the bravado his girlfriend showed, but was in even more shock at the words that were exchanged between the other two. Mika and Maddie shook their heads looking the least bit happy and Lexi with her hands on her hips with a glare towards the oldest Rodgers sibling. Pound had his arms crossed muttering \"What the hell?\" under his breath, while both Bang and Bupkus were raising their brows in an upset manner. Nawt, on the other hand, was far more upset than the rest. He looked on at Hale with an appalled look, unable to believe that the boy would say such horrible words to his own sister. It wasn't until the red Monstar glanced over and caught the distraught features on Kari's face that he felt his stomach churning horribly. Kari's body started shaking slightly and her eyes becoming glossy with tears. Before he or anyone else could react or say anything else, the young girl made a break for it and sprinted out of the gazebo and into the vast vineyard of the garden. Marie cried out for her cousin, feeling bad at the turn of events, \"Kari! Wait! Come back!\" Bupkus scooped her up and gestured at the others with a nod. \"I'll take Marie and we'll go get her. Doubt she'll get far.\" Lexi and Mika opted as well to go look in another direction for their friend, while everyone else stayed behind to handle the situation with Hale. Pound placed his shoulder on Nawt, \"You should go look for her too. We'll take care of Mr. Hot Stuff over here.\" With a quick nod, the red alien took off in the direction he saw his girlfriend take off in, but not before casting a slight glare at Hale, who cast his eyes down to the ground bitterly. Once the red speedster was out of sight, Pound took the opportunity to step up to the pyro and roughly pinned him to one of the gazebo beams. \"Boy, you really screwed up big time.\" Hale kept staring down at the hard concrete, not even bothering to fight back on Pound's hold. Bugs munched on another one of his carrots and walked up to them. \"Take it easy there, Pound. Hale, that wasn't a nice thing to say to your sister. You know she loves ya very much and appreciates that you care for her, but she is right; you can't keep her in your shadow forever.\" Daffy walked over and picked up a stray daisy and started plucking the petals one by one. \"Hare brain's got a point. I mean, come on! Who can blame her? She's felt all cramped up and put in a bind from having any freedom that even her comfort zone is gone!\" Lola shot a look at Daffy. \"Daffy, that's not helping!\" The mallard shrugged his shoulders. \"What? You want it sugar-coated? The kid's gotta face reality: no one wants to stay cooped up forever! You gotta fly on your own someday, and believe me, I doubt that there should be any issues with it! His sister is a pretty reliable and trustworthy chick! If she wasn't, then we'd probably wouldn't have trusted her with saving our lives long ago to begin with!\" Everyone stared at Daffy with stupefied looks, unable to process the fact that what he said made complete sense. Daffy shot a look at the entire group. \"What? Oh, come on people! Even I can make sense every now and then!\" Hale stared at Daffy for a moment before looking back down shamefully and nodded slightly. Nada agreed with the black duck. \"Daffy's right. She can't be stuck with you acting like her nanny for the rest of her life. Also, I doubt you'd even want that for yourself either. If you really want your sister to be happy, then you should let her live and let live.\" Daffy plucked two more petals off the dead daisy. \"See? I make a point! Time you let your sis spread her wings! After all, she is gonna get hitched, ain't she?\" Hale snapped his head back up at the revelation, not able to believe what he's hearing. \"What?\" Pound smacked his face in dumbfounded bewilderment. \"Way to go, loudmouth!\" Bugs gave a sour look over at Daffy, and was joined in with all the other Tunes and three Monstars. Nada rolled her eyes as if to say 'oh brother!'. Daffy plucked the last petal, glancing around stupidly. \"What? What did I- oh..\" Ignoring his feathered rival, Bugs walked up to take point, knowing there's no going back about it. \"Listen, Hale. Everyone here practically knows about this except you and your sister. Nawt plans to propose to Kari and ask for her hand in marriage and to be clearly honest with ya, we all support this. Nawt's been very good to your sis and has been there for her through the good and the bad. Not to mention they've also know each other for a pretty long time. You know deep down as well as any of us that he will never, and I say never, hurt her or do any sort of harm towards her or even to you. Nawt knows how much you care for your sister and that you mean well as her brother and even rightfully so, but you got to let them make their own choices too.\" After a few moments, Hale swallowed hard, his eyes burning with guilt and his anger replaced with remorse. \"What have I done? I- I shouldn't have those things to her..\". Bugs motioned to Pound to let the male go. Pound nodded and released his hold on the now guilty pyro. Bugs placed a hand on Hale's shoulder, assuring him. \"Now, it's not something that can't be fixed. You were just trying to do what you thought was what a good big brother should do. Now why don't we just put this behind us and go look for your sister?\" Hale nodded. \"Yeah. I got to apologize to her. It wasn't fair that I said those awful things to her. Kari's right: I was acting like a brat. And you're right too, Bugs. Nawt has been there many times for my sis, even if I may not feel like acknowledging it.\" Bupkus asked with a bit of nervousness, \"So does this mean that you're ok with him marrying your little sis?\" Hale looked up and nodded. \"Yeah. To be honest, I guess I'm just afraid. Afraid that my sis is already such big steps and… afraid that she won't need me anymore.\" Nada placed a hand on his shoulder. \"That's not true at all, Hale. Kari does and will always need you. She's always looked up to you. But you have to trust and believe in her.\" Hale smiled at the moreno's words. \"Yeah. Thanks, Nada.\" Daffy tossed aside the dead petal less flower and spoke up. \"Alright! Enough sentimentality and mushy stuff! Let's just go find her so hot shot here can say his 'sorry' and get an 'OK' on this marriage stuff!\" With a cheer, the entire group split up into smaller units as they spread about in search for their fellow friend. A little more than a mile away was Kari perched up in a tree branch, her quiet sobs only audible to her own ears, as well as another's not far from where she was at. Only a few yards away in the darkness sat a tall, slender and mysterious figure with dangerously glowing green eyes. With an evil chuckle, he breathed out in a cruel and sinister voice. \"Not to worry, my sweet. Soon, very soon… I'll put you out of your misery. You.. and your brother! \"[Chapter 6] I didn't expect things to climax so quickly, do you? Well, don't be so certain that that's all of it! There's far more to come in this next chapter! I own my OCs and only my OCs. I couldn't believe what happened back there, and more especially, I couldn't believe the harmful words that we've exchanged between us. One moment, I was frustrated and upset at how my brother was behaving constantly, and the next thing I knew, I was running off like a speeding bullet out of the gazebo and away from everyone else with tears stinging in my eyes. Somewhere behind me as I jumped out from the pagoda, I swore I could have heard Marie call out for me, but I was too muddled and distressed to even bother or care. My body was screaming at me to keep on running and don't stop. It's like it was demanding me to release whatever pent up emotions I had at the current time and to not stop at any time soon. It soon became dark outside, and after a good long while of running, I slowly came to a stop and walked up to a tall tree. I started climbing up on it and made it high enough to where I felt I was out of sight for the time being. Once nestled on the branch, I let everything loose and began to cry. 'This is terrible. What Hale said was uncalled for, but what I said to him was just as bad. We've never had a fight as bad as this before.' I continued to sob for a good five minutes or so, letting all my anger and pain out. I whimpered softly to myself, \"What I would give for a hug right now..\" Like the many times before in the past, I felt a strong arm pull me gently close to a muscular and warm body, and the voice of the owner hushing me with kind familiar words. \"It's ok, baby girl. Shh. I'm here, so don't cry.\" Some more tears leaked out as I fully embraced the figure back, knowing well who it was. \"Oh, Nawt. What have I done? I didn't mean to get off at him. It's just that I was so frustrated, and-\" He gently stroked my back, trying to soothe me and silenced my cries and whimpers. \"Kari, look at me.\", he said firmly. I stifled a sob, refusing to look up at him from shame. Gently, he took a hold of my chin and lifted my face so that my eyes came in contact with his. \"Kari, none of this was your fault. You had every right to be upset and we all know you didn't mean to say what you said to Hale. So you told him the honest truth; doesn't mean it's the end of the world for either of you! The others are trying to reason things out with him as we speak at this precise moment, so don't you start worrying your pretty little head about it, alright?\" He flashed me his giant toothy grin to try and cheer me up. I sniffled a bit and gave him a small smile back, only to momentarily go back to a frown. \"But- but what if he doesn't forgive me? And what about what he also said?\" Nawt shook his head. \"He won't hold it against you, Kari. Hale may be a bit head strong at times, but he does love you immensely, and I'm very sure that right now he's feeling just as bad for saying what he said to you too.\" Letting his words sink in, I nodded with a small smile. Deep down, I knew Nawt was right; Hale does care for me very much and despite that he has his moments, he is trying his hardest to just be the best brother he can be for me. I hugged Nawt tightly and spoke just barely above a whisper. \"Thank you, Nawt. You are always there beside me when I needed you. I love you.\" His chest rumbled as he chuckled happily and hugged me back, showing how glad he was to help. \"Anything for you, beautiful. I love you too.\" I lifted my head up to meet his gaze, the tears gone but their salty trails still remaining on my face. He caressed his thumbs carefully over the somewhat dry tear stains, as if trying to erase the pain they left behind. I flushed slightly, my body starting to feel a bit tingly. He then leaned in and kissed me tenderly on the forehead, followed by the tip of my nose and then lingered a few centimeters away from my lips. I waited to see if he was going to do what I thought he was, but to my surprise, he pulled away and instead pulled me in more tightly into his embrace. I noticed that Nawt's breathing became a bit shallow and I could feel his heart pounding at a fast rate. \" I love you so much that I can't stand it.. I can't wait until..\" Curious about what he meant, I breathed into his ear, \" Can't wait until what, Nawt..?\" Before I could get him to tell me, his ears then perked up as we both heard Hale's, Bupkus, and everyone else's voice calling out for me. He glanced down to the ground below us, then turned back to me with a disappointed smile. \"It's nothing. Let's go, Kari. The others are looking for you and they're probably getting very worried right about now.\" Nodding in response, he raised himself to his feet and jumped off the branch and down to the rich soil below. Once he landed, he got up and extended his arms out towards me. \"Come on, Kari! I'll catch you!\" I smiled down at him, feeling better than before and threw myself down towards his open arms that awaited me to fall into. Within moments, he caught me like a ballerina caught in midair. As he placed me down on my feet and held me in place, I couldn't hold back about the butterfly feeling in my stomach and leaned up to kiss him square on the lips. I held on firmly to the sides of his face, and no sooner did I feel his arms wrap tightly around me, pulling him as humanely close as possible. After a few couple minutes, we pulled apart and smiled at one another. \"Thanks so much, Nawt. You're the best man a girl like me could ever have in her life.\" Nawt grinned brightly from ear to ear, looking like an adorable goof ball. A few moments later, Hale, Pound, Mika, and a couple of the Tunes came to where we were at, all looking relieved. Becoming self-conscious about being still in Nawt's hold in front of Hale, I pulled apart from my boyfriend for the moment and turned to face my brother. \"Hale, listen I-\" \"Kari, look I-\" My brother spoke at the same time as me and then we both looked awkwardly at one another. Hale then took his chance and taking a step forward. \"Kari, I- Well, what I wanted to say is- uh, I'm really sorry for- for being a jerk and a brat, and I-\", but before he could finish up his sentence, his eyes grew wide and suddenly jumped out at me. \"KARI, MOVE!\" He shoved me to the side roughly and as I was about to hit the ground, Nawt nimbly caught me. \"Hale, what-!\" I stopped at mid-sentence as I heard a shot echo in the air and it hit Hale! The next thing I knew, I saw my brother get electrocuted by whatever that was shot out, his eyes rolled back as he screamed in agonizing pain. \"HALE! NO!\", I cried out in dismay. Acting quickly, Pound seemed to have seen the source of the electric shots and grabbed it, which also electrocuted him as well. The orange Monstar roared in pain, though he was trying to fight it. Using whatever strength his iron control could muster, he ripped off the main conductors that were attached to Hale's body and threw them back to the source from where it was shot. The conducted plies whizzed past the branches and hit the source, a loud roar echoing through the dark night skies. Pound began to sway back and forth before collapsing onto the ground, completely losing conscious. Smoke was emitting off from Hale, and he too, suddenly fell hard onto the cold ground with a loud thud, lying there motionless. Bang looked down at their fallen leader completely horrified, then with an angry snarl, turned to where the assailant attacked. Bupkus handed Marie over to Lexi and Maddie, as both he and Bang ran to find the attacker. Blanko held on to a shocked looking Nada, completely taken by surprise himself at the sudden ambush. Nawt continued to hold me, his countenance showing as much revulsion and surprise as any of us. Mika was panicking and tried to wake Pound, but to no avail. As for me, my sight was dead set on my brother's motionless body. I felt my body go entirely numb and all other sound around me was as if it was put on mute. My eyes wouldn't water but stung more than they ever did. I couldn't even tell if he was still breathing or not. All I knew was that my brother got attacked… while trying to save me. ' Hale… What- what just happened..? Please… please tell me this is all just some crazy nightmare… Hale… HALE..!' From there my mind stopped working, and my entire vision went pitch black.[Chapter 7] So I have another chapter on the works coming up right here! One can only imagine what fate has in store now for our heroes! I only own my OCs, except for Nada, who belongs rightfully to MonstarzGirl. This might be a bit of a short chapter, but I will make up for it later on! Black. There was nothing but black. I felt like I was all alone as I stood in the empty void and thought about the events that just happened right before my eyes. Flashback: \" KARI, MOVE!\" Hale pushed me down to the ground, but not before Nawt broke my fall. \"Hale, what-?\" Then I suddenly saw my brother get hit in the chest, almost close to his heart with two conductors of the sort and was painfully electrocuted. Pound was the only one who saw what was going on and reacted as quickly as he could before Hale could be totally fried, but it also caused him to get hurt just as badly. As soon as Pound grabbed whatever was clutched on to my brother, ripped it off, and threw it towards the origin of where it was shot from, the mighty giant fell… and so did Hale. After that, my world went dark. End Flashback Feeling some light poke around my eye lids, they slowly fluttered open. Blinking away some of the blurriness, I looked around to see I was in Nawt's bedroom and on his bed, indicating that we were most likely back at Monstar Manor. However, as I looked around the room, I noticed that Nawt was nowhere to be seen. Gathering up my strength, I lifted myself up and off the bed, wobbling a bit as I stood up. I began making my way out of the room and out towards the hallway and down the stairs. Some of the Tunes were down in the main lobby: Tweety, Granny, Sylvester, Elmer, Foghorn, and Yosemite. The small yellow canary saw me walking down the steps and chirped, \"Kari! You're awake!\" Noticing that I was holding on to the railing for support, Foghorn and Sly made their way over to help me out. \"Are you, I say, are you alright now, hon?\" The black cat also spoke up with his lisp, \"Yeah, you had quite the nasthty shock back there!\" I shook my head and muttered, \"I'm perfectly fine, but thanks. Do you guys know where my brother's at?\" The moment I said that, everyone looked down at the floor with dead silence, not helping the situation and thus making me very anxious. Granny noticed how worried I was and walked her way over to me. \"Sweetie, maybe it's best that you go downstairs and see for yourself.\" \"Wait, downstairs? I didn't know there's a downstairs.\" She took my hand and started leading the way towards a door in the very far back of the house. Opening it, there was a stairwell leading further down into what I suppose was the Monstar's basement. Feeling more stable, I began stepping down the steps, and found myself in a huge bright room. The entire area was so big, you could assume that it was at least the other half of the whole house! However, I discerned the mixture of some very strong chemicals, almost like the disinfectants and alcohol they use inside of hospitals. My stomach did more twists and turns, knowing that what I will find here won't be good. My hearing also picked up the sounds of voices, both deep ones and feminine ones, as well as a couple of toonish ones, presumably Bugs, Daffy's, and Lola's. I walked on further until I reached the far back, which was another room encased with glass walls and tall glass doors. Opening it, silence fell in the room as all eyes turned to me. Some in shock, and even some in sadness and pity. I ignored the people around me, as my eyes fell on the two bodies lying on two separate beds, and connected to them, are a bunch of monitors and life support systems. Mika was sitting down next to Pound's unconscious being, her eyes slightly red and her face tear streaked. My eyes settled down on my brother's body, his chest rising and falling very slowly. As I began striding my way to him, Bupkus' big hand stopped me from going any further. That's when I began looking around at them all, as I transgressed from worried to frantic. \"What happened? What's wrong with Hale?\" Witch Hazel, who was also with them, shuffled up to me and placed a green hand on my shoulder. \"Relax, dear. Sit down for a minute.\" Nawt pulled me up a chair and gently helped me into it. I held onto his big red hand in need for comfort, and he squeezed back gently. The looney witch sat down herself in a separate chair and looked back at me with some sorrow. \"Dearie, as you are well aware of, when your brother found you, he was attacked-\" \"To save me. That attack was meant for me, and Hale took the hit.\", my voice cracked slightly, feeling somewhat guilty. Nawt rubbed my back with other hand to try and assure me otherwise that I wasn't to feel guilty about anything. Witch Hazel nodded. \"Well, yes. So it may seem. We cannot be too certain of that yet. As I was saying, dearie, the attack was a very strong one. It consisted of a powerful electrical charge that goes beyond that of a normal one here on earth.\" \"Wait, what?\" This caught my attention. Bupkus spoke up. \"What Witch Hazel is saying is that this sort of attack isn't a simple one. Normally, if someone gets electrocuted, it can lead to some obvious complications like unconsciousness, possible burns of the epidermis, and heart complications as well, not to mention it can affect your brain drastically.\" I nodded, trying to follow at what he's trying to get at. Bang took over from there, with Maddie standing alongside him. \"The attack was well planned out. Bupkus and I ran to find the source of the weapon used to attack your brother, and we were hoping to find the attacker himself. The perpetrator disappeared, but they did leave behind part of their weapon.\" The green monolith tossed over to me the two metal conductors, which looked like the ends of an input cord for audio/video of a video game console, only with two sharp needle like prongs sticking out at the ends, which were slightly coated in blood. The conductors were connected to the ends of some cords that were also capable of insulating the electrical charges. \"This sort of material cannot be found anywhere here on Earth, let alone produced.\" I snapped back up to the green alien in total surprise. \"So you're telling me that the weapon is from another world?\" Bang nodded. \"Exactly. So we can also assume that the attacker is definitely not from around here either.\" I stood up abruptly, my voice filled with anger. \"But who else is there aside from you guys that knows about us that would make them want to hurt us? Swackhammer is dead . Hale and I shishkabobed him for sure a couple years back, and we all saw that!\" Bupkus moved his hands as if to usher me to calm down. \"We know, Kari. That's where we are kinda bamboozled about too. The only thing we can hope for is to try and see if our computers here can identify the foundation, or should I say, the manufacturer of the material used for the weapon and from there, see where that will lead us.\" Biting my lip slightly, I looked down at the pieces of wire and metal ends in my hands before looking back up at Bupkus. \"How long will that take?\" Bang sighed, shaking his head. \"For material like that? We can't really say. At least about three weeks to a month, maybe more.\" Everyone including myself gawked up at him with bewilderment. \"A month?! That long?! But what about Hale, and Pound too?!\" Blanko piped up from the side, who was sitting next to Nada in a couple of chairs as well. \"Well, from what our medical technology could gather, as well as what Witch Hazel's magic can procure…\", he trailed off, looking uneasy. \"Well? What is it? How long will they be like this?\", I snapped. I was becoming uneasy myself, worried about what the fate of my brother and the Monstar leader will be. Nawt took point turning to face me, placing both his hands on my shoulders. \"Kari… We don't know. The attack is about three times more powerful and possibly, even more fatal, than a regular electric shock. We're lucky that.. Well, that Pound acted like he did and stopped the attack before another moment longer…\" \"W-What..?\" My voice was cracking even more. Nawt saw my crestfallen features and stopped. Bupkus picked up from there, knowing it was just as hard for Nawt to tell me as it was for him. \"Had Pound not interfered, the electrical charge would have successfully shut down your brother's internal body functions for good. In other words, Hale would have died within less than a minute.\" I brought my hands up to my mouth to stifle a sob, not believing what could have happened had Pound not acted when he did. In the end, it also caused the Monstar leader to almost lose his life to save my brother's. Bang turned to the two motionless bodies that were in the hospital beds with worry. \"For all we know, they might never wake up. At this point, they're comatose.\"[Chapter 8] The intensity of this story really is getting to the edge! Alas, there will be some good news coming up son, so do not fret! I only own my OCs. Nada belongs to MonstarzGirl. I do not own \"The Grey\" by Icon for Hire either. A couple days have passed since the brief yet cruel attack on Hale and Pound. Bugs, Bang, and Bupkus, along with Nawt, came with me to explain what had happened to my parents, which devastated them both. We were also able to explain that the other Monstars were currently working on trying to find a way to get the comatose duo to become more stabilized and get them on a quick road to full recovery. Thankfully, mom and dad grew more calm cause of that and asked me to keep an eye on things. They also had to leave on another business trip together, so they said that Aunt Jackie will check up on me every now and then if I need anything, as well as having me check in to let them know about any progress about Hale's condition. Another thing came up that Elise was away and out of town with her mom due to an emergency call from someone that needed assistance with another animal shelter in a different county further up north. I knew she was wondering why Hale didn't call or text her, so I had to gather up by courage and contacted her about the news. Of course, Elise too, was just as distraught and told me that she'll be returning as soon as possible to see what she could do to help. After all, she loves my brother to bits and pieces and would do just about anything for him. To sum it up, I was home alone with only my presence keeping the residence occupied. Nawt heard about my being alone in my own house and vouched to keep me company for the duration that my parents are gone, as well as my brother's absence. Bang almost went against it, but thankfully, Bupkus was on his side and agreed that it was a good idea for my boyfriend to stay by my side while things are tough as they are at this time. It was Friday, and I didn't have to go to school since it was Thanksgiving break. I received a phone call from Nawt, saying he was going to come by later this afternoon with some of his belongings to accommodate his 'moving in' with me. It made me feel a bit better about things, but it didn't feel the same without Hale. I sat down in the recording studio that our dad had installed in a spare room downstairs about a year and a half ago for whenever Hale and I had a song that we had and wanted to test out or record. It didn't feel as lively as it did when my brother was around with me. By now, Hale and I would be sitting here arguing about what lyrics we should sing, what words to use, or even laugh and joke around as he would make some random noise with the musical equipment. Trying to hold back more useless tears, I tried to distract myself with something, then I saw Hale's acoustic guitar sitting right in the corner to the right of me. \"Hale… It really does feel like you've disappeared… I feel like I'm just standing on the edge of what's real and what's not. Please, big brother! Please, come back! I'm very lost without you now!\" I was whimpering bitterly to myself, still unable to grasp the reality that my brother is now in a coma, with no way of knowing if he's a vegetable or if his mind is still lingering there somewhere. As if my body and mind decided to work on their own without my consent, I got up and took Hale's guitar then started turning on the recording and musical equipment. Taking a deep breath, I started playing the recording of the piano notes I did about a few weeks back with Hale, and started singing. \" I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away I am letting myself look the other way. And the hardest part in all of this is I don't think I know my way back home Is it worth the journey or do I let my heart settle here? How cold have I become? I didn't want to… Lose you by what I've done Caught in the grey\" I started strumming my brother's guitar a little more, feeling the vibe of the music and the other instruments coming together. \" I don't wanna look you in the eyes, you might call me away I don't wanna give you the chance to make me stay And the hardest part in all of this is I know my way back I don't want to go And let you see all that has become of me I should have known, I should have known I didn't have a chance\" I began strumming harder, my voice becoming desperate and anguished. \" How cold have I become? I didn't want to… Lose you by what I've done Caught in the grey It burns for a moment but But then it numbs you Takes you and leaves you just Caught in the grey\" The next set of lines I started singing out unconvincingly at first, but soon fell passionately with each line I sang out, emphasizing the very last words. \" You tell me In your deepest pain In your weakest hour In your darkest night You are lovely You tell me In your deepest pain In your weakest hour In your darkest night You are lovely\" Taking up my heart felt feelings and pain, I sang out lowly at the first few lines, then my voice rose with as much feeling as possible, the fresh tears beginning to emerge from the corners of my eyes. \" How cold have I become? I didn't want to… Lose you by what I've done Caught in the grey It burns for a moment but But then it numbs you Takes you and leaves you just Caught in the grey In your deepest pain In your weakest hour In your darkest night You are lovely In your deepest pain In your weakest hour In your darkest night You are lovely..!\" I let the piano come to a finish as I said out the last line, tears streaming down my countenance. \" I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away.\" I stopped the recording as the song came to a close. Little did I know that I had an audience that was silently watching the entire time I was singing. As I turned around, I caught sight of Lexi, Marie, Bupkus, Nada, Blanko, and Nawt, all looking with awe and even some sadness. I walked out of the recording studio booth and was pulled into a big hug by the girls, including my little cousin. \"Don't cry, Kari. Everything will be ok! You'll see!\" Marie beamed up one of her cute and cheery smiles at me, and it really touched me. Lexi squeezed me with one of her bear hugs. \"She's right. It'll all work out in the end. We just gotta stick together, that's all!\" As she pulled away, Nada moved in and hugged me as well. \"Yeah! In no time at all, Hale and Pound will be back to their old, grouchy selves and everything will be back as it was. We just gotta wait for Elise to be back in town and have her work her magic! It always pulls through for us when we need a super fixer upper, right?\" Pulling back from my female companions, I smiled brightly, wiping away whatever saltiness from eyes that remains. \"Yeah, you're right. Thank you very much, gals. You're the best!\" Blanko had a warm grin on his face, liking that we were all becoming a bit positive for once. Bupkus had a large toothy grin and picked up Marie into his massive purple arms. \"That's my Marie for ya! Always a bright ball of sunshine!\" He kissed her on the forehead, earning a giggle from the five year old girl. Blanko stepped himself, \"We just finished helping Nawt drop off his stuff in the guest bedroom upstairs, if that's okay with you?\" I nodded, feeling much better and comfortable than before. \"Yes thank you, Blanko. Thanks to all of you. I'm glad to know I'm not alone in all this.\" Nawt stepped up to me and pulled me into one of his warm embraces. \"You're never alone, Kari. You'll always have us around, and no matter what, we've always got your back!\" Hearing those words gave me a huge boost of assurance and self-confidence. I threw my arms around him and gave him a huge hug back. Lexi looked down at her phone to check the time and gasped. \"Whoa guys! We got to get rolling! Elise should be back in town in about half hour, so we gotta go fetch her. Nada, could you take Marie with you back to Monstar Manor?\" The raven haired girl nodded. \"Sure thing. C'mon, Marie!\" She took the child and held her hand, and the both started making their way back to my room so they can pass through the mirror back to Looney Tune Land. Bupkus took a serious appearance once Marie was out of sight and earshot. \"Alright, team. Let's vamoose! Nawt, you stay here and take care of your gal. Both of youse better behave and don't do anything you shouldn't!\" With that said, the two Monstars and tanned blonde made their exit out of the room to go fetch Elise at her house. Once they were gone, it was just me and Nawt left alone in the house. I smiled and took my Monstar boyfriend's hand. \"C'mon. I'll help you unpack and get settled down.\" With a smile, we both went upstairs and began unpacking.[Chapter 9] So here I am, back with another chapter for 'Revolution'! I do plan to make this story the longest one (hopefully) out of all the Space Jam stories that I have done by far. So far, it's looking good! I intend to bring in more good news into this chapter to lighten things up more, and so on! Thanks to those who favorite, followed, and are reviewing this story! I very much appreciate it! I only own my OCs, Nada is owned by MonstarzGirl, and I don't own Warner Brothers. Third Person POV: Bupkus, Blanko, and Lexi exited the house and set off on their mini trek to go find Elise and bring her over to Monstar Manor. Lexi's short wavy locks bounced as she trotted down the front porch steps following the two aliens. Much to their dismay, the two males grabbed their female companion and jumped into the bushes to hide, as there were a few obstacles that they had to… avoid. First, the mail truck was just around the corner, meaning that with the mail man making his rounds, the two Monstars could easily be spotted. Second was that the neighbor right across from the Rodgers' household was out watering his petunia patch, which makes for another easy discovery. Finally, said neighbor had a Doberman outside as well, and for obvious reasons, could make their discovery all the more easier. \"Crap!\" Bupkus muttered as he analyzed the entire background. Blanko raised a worried brow. \"How are we gonna get past all this?\" Lexi glanced at the two with confusion. \"What? I don't get it, why are we hiding?\" Bupkus looked down at Lexi with a serious face. \"Lexi, if you were them, how would you react if you saw a pair of two huge aliens from outer space?\" Lexi then realized what he meant and smiled bashfully. \"Oh, right. My bad.\" Blanko looked over at the neighbor, then the dog, then the mail man, then immediately back to the dog. \"Uh, Bupkus? The mail man and the flower guy I'm not too worried about, but what about the dog?\" Bupkus glanced at his blue friend. \"What do you want me to do? I'm just as stumped as you are!\" Then like a light bulb lit above her head, Lexi took out her cell phone and dialed a number. The two aliens eyed her curiously as they heard her phone ringing, followed by someone picking up, and it sound like someone with a bad lisp issue. \"Hello, Daffy? Hey, I thought this was Bugs' cell? Well, never mind. Listen, I need you two to do me a favor, you see…\" She then began explaining the dilemma, and no soon after did she hear a loud \"hoo hoo!\" followed by the call ending. \"So what the duck say?\" Bupkus asked his girlfriend with an inquisitive look. Within a couple moments, the ground next to them rumbled a bit and out came two familiar figures. \"Eh, what's up, doc?\", Bugs munched on his carrot, along with saying his usual catch phrase. Daffy peeped an eye out through the bush and pulled back with a bewildered look. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Back up! I knew you said you had a people problem and a dog problem, but you said nothing about a Doberman!\" Bugs scowled at his black feathered friend. \"Daffy, it's no big jiff! Don't worry, Lexi! We'll take care of the dog, while you guys carefully sneak over to Elise's house. By the way, here's something Witch Hazel wanted me to give ya.\" The grey hare handed over a small bag to the tanned girl, who shook the contents with wonder. \"What is it?\" \"It contains a mirror brooch that Elise can put on the top of any large mirror in her house, which can enable you guys to transport yourselves back to the infirmary in Monstar Manor without having to worry about making another long trip.\" Blanko gave a stupefied look over at the grey rabbit. \"But doesn't the powder that she gave us take care of that already?\" Bugs nodded. \"Yeah, but like she said, it can lead you to just about anywhere also. And time is of the essence, so we want to get things done as quickly and efficiently as possible so we can save Hale and Pound.\" With full understanding, Lexi securely pocketed the small package in her pocketbook. \"So will you guys help us?\", Bupkus asked, mainly glaring down at Daffy. The mallard shot a look at the purple mass of muscle and growled. \"Oh, fine! Seems like we don't have much choice here. If it will help Hale and Pound, then yeah we're ready!\" Blanko suddenly grew alarmed and whispered to his fellow allies. \"Uh, guys? You might wanna get goin' on that plan of yours! Fido is making his way over to us now!\" The Doberman's ears perked up at the noise coming from the bushes across the street and let out a low growl. Getting up from the porch without his master noticing, he began making its way over to the sounds and voices coming from the shrubbery. With a quick salute, Daffy and Bugs dove back down into the ground and started tunneling into the ground, making the dirt rise above them. The Doberman then saw the dirt rising into two separate burrows and growled. The dog turned and started to follow the trails, giving the two Monstars and the human girl the perfect opportunity to progress to the far end of the street. As the mailman was filling in some of the mail boxes on the other side and wasn't looking, Bupkus tiptoed from tree to tree to bush, avoiding detection. Lexi decided to casually walk out in the open, if the occasion called for her to create a diversion so that the other two aliens and Tunes needed aid from being caught. Bupkus swung from the high tree tops like Tarzan, trying to resist the urge of doing Tarzan's yell while doing so. The giant dog continued following the burrowing of both rodents, until they both split into opposite directions rather than going the same way. Unknown to Daffy did the dog decide to follow his trail rather than his long eared compadre, and what came next, was quite unexpected. Once near some bushes and inside the doghouse, Daffy popped his head out to see what progress has been made. As soon as he turned his head around, he saw the giant dog right above him, growling menacingly. The mallard's eyes grew as big as saucers and squeaked. \"Mother!\" Bugs, not too far away, saw what was happening and covered his ears with an \"Oh, brother. Here we go.\" The dog started barking like mad along with Daffy's cries and squawks. This drew the attention of the mailman, as the owner was inside the house to get a refreshment. \"What in the world?\" the mailman bent over to see what the commotion was within the dog house, only to have something black and feathery fly out towards him, knocking him into the ground. No soon after did the Doberman follow suit and jumped right onto the mailman, who was covered with all of the stationary that he was delivering. Bugs took the chance and grabbed Daffy by the tail feathers, yanking him into the burrowed hole and out of site before they could gather even more attention than they asked for. The owner of the dog stepped out of his house and dropped his tall glass of lemonade, as he saw his dog attacking a very frantic and hysterical mailman. As the trio tumbled in their own roundhouse fight, Lexi waved over to the Monstars that it was safe to make the rest of the journey over. Bupkus skipped over a couple picket fences and dodge rolled up to the front porch of Elise's home. Blanko swung from a very high branch and landed into the soft grass, straightening his lanky form. In the ground below them popped out both Bugs and Daffy, with the latter looking a bit battered and bruised from his encounter with the massive canine. \"Well, it looks like they've got their own issues to deal with now, docs! We'll see ya back at the mansion!\" With a wave of his gloved paw, the clever hare dove back into the hole. \"Thatsth… is the lasth time I will ever do work involving dogsth!\" Bug's gloved paw stretched back out to pull down the complaining duck back with him, as they both returned back to Looney Tune Land. Seeing the fight between the mailman, the Doberman, and the dog's owner wasn't going to simmer down anytime soon, Lexi turned to the two aliens. \"Well, shall we gentlemen?\" Blanko nodded and courteously knocked on the front door. Greeting them was a very familiar and kind hearted face, and the one they need the most help from. \"Oh, hello! I was wondering when you would come! Please, come in!\" Elise smiled at her friends, and welcomed them inside. ","Summary":" Hello again! I wonder how long it's been since I got the chance to write down a new story.. hmm.. P"},{"Movie":"Swing Kids","Title":"To No One Go The Spoils","Author":"The Madmadam","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4952709","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Tiny black dots floated down from the sky, dropped from larger grayer dots, to the seas, and disappeared under the latter. The young soldier looking upon couldn't help but snicker. The \"Allies\" were almost as bad off as they were. \"This is crazy!\" The soldier beside him exclaimed. \"A smart fellow knows I'm as loyal as the next person, but Hitler is wrong this time. We have nothing. Our planes make a poor match to theirs. We need to move out.\" \"You shouldn't speak so of your superiors.\" The young soldier felt himself saying out of habit, though the part about no planes was undeniably correct. \"Halt die Schnauze, Lutz. Just because you're older than most of us doesn't mean you have the right to talk down.\" \"You're wrong.\" Lutz smirked, though he wanted to wring this retarded imbecile's neck. \"I have been here longer than any of you. I have the experience. You—have nothing.\" \"If you were a Frenchman, I'd kill you in a second.\" The younger fighter said in disgust, reloading his rifle and staring with intent at the crawling, American-packed beach. If he were not under orders, he would kill this boy in a second, Lutz thought to himself in frustration. He didn't know how he had toiled, idled, and prepared for this role. Nobody knew how he had had to bargain, crawl, beg, intimidate, sit back and take orders, not to mention that stupid WEL camp training he had to go through, for 6 weeks, for years, years before this . They would not even put Lutz, who had long been qualified, held back because he was qualified, in an advanced camp. And Herr Berger had gotten right in without trying. Luftwaffe. He could swear that bastard was a fucking faggot, the way he moped around after Peter had been hauled away to Fuhlsbüttel, where those other Hamburg Swingheine were taken. Well he had \"wised up,\" hadn't he? Anything was better than the pointless humiliation those Swing Kids faced, but it was the local Gestapo, the Hitlerjugend leader, and so Hitler himself that had done this to him, held him back for so long. Neither side could win. The same seemed true for the situation he witnessed now. Most of the paratroopers were drowning, and few were getting past the hedgehogs they had set up in the sea. But the Allies had air superiority and 5000 planes on its side. The Luftwaffe, in grim comparison, had 820 aircraft, 200 of which were ready to go into battle. Allegedly no regiment had received commands from the Führer yet. There was a story going around that their leader had gone into hiding after hearing about the surprise and could not currently be found. 'That showed how brave of a leader we have had these past eleven years,' several fighters Lutz had overheard said with disgust. The story was nonsense. Hitler was awake, alert, and aware of their action on the beach and would be ready to call them back if they failed. Rommels was in Germany now, but they didn't need him to give the word- Hitler was the high commander. If the entire division was gullible enough to believe this wide-spread tall tale, they were not worth much- a fact that would not surprise Lutz. Back in his day the HJ leaders had taught eager students, not these oafs he had to call his comrades now. Even Berger had had a healthy patriotic spirit for the year or so he was enrolled. Berger may be a faggot, but he had had more 'man' to him than this whole division put together, it seemed. But he was still a cheating, conniving, sickening faggot . If Lutz ever met his former friend again, he would kill him without consideration. Lutz, looking at the beach, felt a strange ringing in his ears and swore he could almost hear the radio broadcast that would surely be blaring from every radio in the country even so soon at the end of the day: 6 June 1944: Heil Hitler! Long live the Reich! No matter who had the airways, the Americans would be licked on the beach. The pillboxes would make sure of that. And as far as they were concerned, they were invisible, safe in the cliffs. They would surely win. He had not felt so happy since his training in the Hitlerjugend, those days so long ago. 5 years ago he was 17 and born ready for this. 4 years ago he was held back. He would, could, never have his revenge. Only now was he receiving compensation, and it was surely not even worth everything that he had lost. Emil Lutz, no longer a fool and no longer useless, never forgave and never forgot.[Chapter 2] Emil was more lenient than usual during the training session. Then again, he had not had such an all-out boxing match since Berger had gotten smart last year. Face glassy with forced patience, he taught a young boy to block. Embarrassed that he couldn't do it right, the boy kept muttering apologies under his breath. What a pansy. \"Lutz? Herr Lutz?\" Emil turned around. \"Yes?\" \"The Gestapo seeks your presence immediately in the next room. Heil Hitler.\" Japanese Sandman, the familiar tune scratched in by the faint-sounding guitar chords of Django Reinhardt, was playing on a phonograph in the background. Mildly surprised at having identified the musician so easily, Emil shook his head a couple times, disoriented, and again looked at his leader, the Bannführer, mirroring his gaze with an expectant glance. \"Heil Hitler.\" Emil held out his arm and disinterestedly turned out in the hallway. He obeyed all the rules so he knew he wasn't in trouble. This immediate conference- whatever it was- could not be of importance. Herr Knopp was the man in the \"next room.\" Emil was not surprised. He turned around immediately at the closing of the door. \"Ah. Herr Lutz. Such an honor to speak with you, as always.\" Emil raised his eyebrows, a mild expression of polite inquisitiveness on his face. Such a bore to speak with the Gestapo, as always. \"I understand you are to be transferred to the Heer in two weeks.\" Emil nodded, smiling. Such a relief to be away from Berger, that nuisance. Berger was joining the Luftwaffe. \"I have heard wonderful things of your leadership skills.\" Herr Knopp smiled charmingly, staring clearly at him. \"Such a shame we must lose such a devoted teacher.\" Silence. Emil still stared at him. Why had he brought him here? Was it congratulations? With training these infants for so long, he deserved one. \"Ah, well, of course I came for a reason.\" Herr Knopp glanced away for a second, speaking again in his soft voice. \"A request, actually.\" This was beginning to become very annoying to Emil. \"I am afraid we are rather short on trained leaders with so much… talent.\" Herr Knopp drummed his fingers against each other. \"The leader of this Hitlerjugend group and I have decided that it is best if you stay, even though we know you have turned 18.\" Herr Knopp paused, scratching his cheek. \"You are simply to continue what you have been doing with the Jungen for a while now. Same routines, of course, possibly a little more rigorous than your previous pace. You are a very fortunate young man, Herr Lutz. Our Führer no doubt likes to see such vigor for the Father. Our youth truly do lead the way. Congratulations.\" He left the room, walking past Emil on the way to the door, without waiting for a response. Emil had none. Knopp was certainly happy with himself now. That was no request; that was an order. Emil could not say no. But he should've known. Any request from an elder to a youth could not be refused in this administration. He wasn't moving on to the Heer. There was no reward. He was stuck teaching these boys- indefinitely. Emil, as always, walked stiffly at a brisk pace, and continued this as he left the room. His shoulder brushed against another HJ who was walking even faster than Emil. \"Hey! Watch who you bump into!\" He shouted, expecting the boy to turn around and apologize. The boy was Thomas- he had caught a glance of his face- and now Emil was facing the back of his uniform and his slick, short hair. Too late to take back the words now that he realized it was him- not that he really wanted to, but they were useless on a fool like him. Berger could've started a fight with him again just now. But Thomas just walked on, his stance much more relaxed than Emil's; he still had a remnant of the notorious Swingjugend swagger, long since he had stopped hitting the clubs. Emil had been rid of all traces naturally. Thomas had been acting strange ever since the raid Emil had led at the Bismark a few months ago. Emil couldn't understand why Peter was so important to him, no matter if they were best friends. He was captured because he wasn't strong enough to resist the spell that Jews had placed over him. Someone so weak was of little value to them. Perhaps he was upset because he suspected- as did everybody else- that Peter was planning to leave the Hitlerjugend. There were many rumors about it. And, Emil had thought it only rumors; he hadn't even known it was possible. But at the last raid at the Curio-Haus, 237 boys were discovered to be Hitlerjugend members or former Hitlerjugend members; 52 of them had left. He had never met someone who had left and probably never would. Most of the Hamburg Swingjugend were sent to Fuhlsbüttel so at least Thomas knew where he was. Fuhlsbüttel was merely a prison camp so Peter would even probably be all right. He was lucky. Though, Emil did admit, they were not so lucky as the Berliners- who by authority of the government had a place especially made for them- Moringen. There they could deal with each other and not new strangers. Though it hardly mattered because all prisoners were the same. The camp was still in construction. And there they would also be put to good work- in an ammunition factory at Volpriehausen. Also there would be the ones who dared stand up to the Third Reich. Emil almost felt sorry for Thomas and his misplaced attachment to people. He was a rebel all right, and against the wrong people. He had been concerned about Thomas for a while, in fact- but he had turned out all right. He just had too much of an instinct for mercy. Emil went back to meet the Bannführer to discuss this. There was no way in hell he would go back to teaching these imbeciles until he got explicit instructions on what he was wanted to do. Herr Knopp did not have the courtesy to grant him that. When an HJ member turned 18, he either had to join the SS or Wehrmacht - and become a member of the Nazi Party- (chances are, both his parents already were members of the Nazi Party) as of 1927. But not all members would be so fortunate. Most members. Emil must've forgotten; of course they had explained that when he had joined. He must've been dozing off, or fooling around, or doing something that he was not supposed to. Surely. Who the hell did Knopp and that youth leader think he was? He had been a loyal Jugend member for 4 years now- 2 years in the Jungvolk - and had he ever disobeyed orders? Had he ever, ever goofed off at a meeting, especially his first one? To be fair, he had fooled around for a few months after leaving the Jungvolk, though that was all in the past. He had been a leader even then: the original hepcat. Emil was ashamed now to have been proud of it. Now, he was the leader of something that actually mattered. He was no longer dancing to that ridiculous music that really wasn't dangerous in any way- he knew, he had been a part of it once- just foolish, and useless. All boys have their rebellious period, and Emil had had his just as every boy did. Thomas never left his and Peter wasn't a true rebel- he was completely transformed by that music. Knopp didn't know best. He, Emil, did. And going into the Wehrmacht-Heer was the best thing that would've ever happened to him in his life- there was nothing more he wanted to do than fight for the Fatherland- and they had destroyed that. Tossed it aside like those Jews sent to camp. By putting Emil so low beneath themselves, they were placing him on the same level as them . The thought disgusted Emil. The Nazis didn't care about anybody but themselves- He would show them that they weren't always right like they thought they were. If he wanted to fight, why wouldn't they let him fight? He would get in the Heer, even if it took years, and he would be the best fighter Germany had ever had, and he alone would pay for the discrimination the \"Allies\" had showed them by, with his own hands, destroying them. The Führer was the only true, undying, and unrelenting person in the entire Nazi Party. All others were hypocritical- greedy and manipulative without limit. It was disgusting. Herr Knopp himself listened to that Swing music and filled his body with impurities. Hitler had promised to cleanse their race and perfect it, ridding all traces of Jew, homosexuality, retardation, and other flaws needing correction. Was there anything he did that didn't go a step in that direction or contradict it? Emil would have to continue what he had been doing before- follow orders. He was obedient- at least to a person's face and not their back. So whatever he was doing now he would continue to do, no matter for how long. The Bannführer agreed wholeheartedly, much to Emil's disgust. Well, it was back to work- and curtains for him.[Chapter 3] AN-nI changed last chapter because I found out that the 'Hitler YouthnLeader,' aka, the adult who is in charge of all HJs in an area, isncalled a Bannführer. A Gefolgschaftsführer, alternatively, is anyouth leader, usually young (around Emil´s age) and in charge of 150nor so HJs- like a unit. Again, the sentiments expressed are not mynown. (I deleted the AN that came before the first chapter, which thatndisclaimer had been on.) Speaking of disclaimers, I do not own Emil,nHerr Knopp, Thomas, or Peter, or any of their parents, etc. Thenvon Hessler brothers were the most promising incoming members thatnthe Hamburg Hitlerjugend had had in years, both involved innthe Jungvolk from the day they turned ten. More exciting thannanything—they were being placed in the Hitlerjugend togethernon request of their father (boldly claiming that the von Hesslersnplaced family above anything else, except for the Reich) at the agesnof 14 and 15. Jürgen had held back a year for his brother toncomplete the course, being offered the privilege of inspecting hisnpeers. Jan was the younger one. Not only were both boys extremelynathletic and fit, but they were exceptionally good-looking andnwell-liked in their school as well as the local Jungvolk . Thenperfect children were here in their wake. HerrennKnopp and Kalinger (the Bannführer) were excited. As was Emil. As anGefolgschaftsführer of the Jugend the boys would be under hisntraining. It would be a great pleasure to teach them; rarely was anrecruit already worthy of defending the Fatherland. Any person withnborn ability made his job easier. Also, if a boy didn't have bornnability, he would never be well-trained enough to fight in the timenallotted. Emil,non one of his lengthy walks around the local Hitlerjugend building, noted that the brick was worn with dents and nicks just bynhaving boys around every day. The obvious lack of care these boysnshowed when off-duty reminded him of he and Thomas acted when theynwere hep cats. Thomas was out of here now. Hell, why'd this have tonkeep coming back to him? Thomas was in the right place in the rightntime—as Emil himself had been until a few weeks ago. They had beennthere together once, before Thomas had to be the wimp and back out.nThe news about his father really was a shame—Emil had known HerrnBerger, who had always seemed loyal enough. Who knew about poor Mrs.nBerger with both of them gone? HerrnKalinger stopped Emil in the hall. \"Herr Lutz?\" He asked. \"Whatnare you doing, if I may ask?\" \"Justnwalking, sir.\" Emil replied. \"There is still a half hour beforenthe new recruits arrive, yes?\" \"Yes.\"nHerr Kalinger nodded slowly. \"Well, enjoy your walk. Heil Hitler.\" \"HeilnHitler.\" Herr Kalinger walked past. Emil paused, before doing thensame. An authority always was first to leave before his inferiornunless his orders said otherwise. Knopp was a great exception nearlynalways to the first. People always came to him on his demands. Knoppninfluenced everybody, including the Bannführer himself, who wasnprobably scared stiff to make such a decision himself to hold HJnmembers over until further notice. Knopp had surprised Emil, fornexample, with his ways of ordering that didn't even seem to benorders. Knopp, by deduction, could not have been anything more than ancoward. Wrong. As soon as Herr Lutz heard from his son that he was toncontinue being in the Hitlerjugend until further notice, henpromised to personally see Herr Knopp and see if he couldn'tnconvince him otherwise. Knopp, with his light, weak persuasive ways,nwouldn't budge by Emil´s father's requests. It had probably notnbeen a good idea to let Herr Knopp set the meeting time and place,nbut Emil's father had disagreed; he had thought that the bestnstrategy—letting Herr Knopp think he was in control. It was a pitynand a mystery that Herr Knopp was always in control. Thendiscussion had been tactful and uneventful, and Herr Lutz had stillnwanted his son in the Heer. Herr Knopp assured him that Emil wouldnindeed fight in the Heer; he just didn't know when (and how, asnEmil suspected,) as of yet. Emil was nearly as upset as his fathernwhen his first (and confident) hopes of being released were dashed.nNow there were other ways—earning the Bannführer's absolutenrespect as an inferior by showing respect, getting a good word fromnthe new recruits, and impressing upon Herr Knopp as well. That mannheld all the power; Emil may as well have accepted it by now. Therenwere about ten new recruits talking amiably to each other when Emilnarrived in the meeting room five minutes early, clad in uniform. Henstood away from the recruits and continued to think: how much longernwould he be in the Hitler Youth instead of the army? Herr Kalingernhad informed him earlier that they were short on members and hadnneeded some of the old members to stay and help with the training atnthe ranking of Gefolgschaftsführer. At the rank ofnGefolgschaftsführer, each person would be in charge of over onenhundred HJs. Emil had already been a Gefolgschaftsführer for a yearnand a half. The Bannführer also needed the hardest workers, as well,nbecause the routines were going to get more rigorous as of this year. Emilnwas in the right place at the right time. Correction: Emil was in thenright at the right time with a twist, a detour. Emil didn't likendeception. He didn't want leadership—he wanted to move on. He didnnot want to be in charge of a hundred and fifty HJs forever. Hell,nbeing promoted to Bannführer wouldn't have changed his mind. Andnhe was probably the only member who was forced to stay; he hadn'tnheard about any others. Damn the stupid liars. In 1940 the web ofnlies grew tighter, pulling Emil in and trapping him when he thoughtnhe had been home free. Hard work and honest work were the only thingsnthat could get him out of this fix, he knew. Glancingnaround the room, Emil could not help but observe the new recruits.nThere were exactly eight, which had been close to his previousnestimate. All of them looked to be fourteen years old. There were nonolder boys left to join. All of the older boys were soldiers when thenrestrictions for attendance of Hitlerjugend meetings hadntightened in 1939, one year ago. There was no way of knowing whichnones were the von Hessler brothers; all of the boys had fair to darknblonde hair and most were arguably good-looking, (the onlyndescription Herr Kalinger had given him of the boys) excepting thenheavyset boy who was slumping in the back. If nothing else, thenroutines here would whip him into shape. He had obviously beennnowhere near the Jungvolk routines at their roughest, ornperhaps none at all. Likely the latter. Emil'snwatch, (which his friends had once jokingly—and accurately—callednhis only conscious,) pointing fingerlessly at numbers, indicated thatnthere were about two minutes to wait before he would begin with thennew recruits. They still chattered. The first lesson they would learnnwas to be quiet by the time training was to begin. Emilnlooked at his watch again. Time. \"Inam Emil Lutz, your unit leader.\" He said, standing and beginning tonpace in front of the recruits. The boys looked at him. \"As I passneach of you, you will tell me your name. Which will be followed withnyour age and why you are here.\" If their previous leader had taughtnthem correctly, how it seemed that he had, they would all knownexactly what to say. The Reich—as well as the Bannführer—demandednabsolute loyalty. By this time, he had made it to the far right ofnthe room. \"Startingnwith you.\" He pointed at the heavyset boy, who had been the firstnone in the line starting on the right, and slowed his pacing. \"FalknAckermann. 14. Heil Hitler.\" Emilnnodded curtly at him and looked at the next person. \"You.\" \"IngenMauhler. 14. Heil Hitler.\" \"Jürgennvon Hessler. 15. Heil Hitler.\" \"Jannvon Hessler. 14. Heil Hitler.\" \"ArturnAckermann. 14. Heil Hitler.\" He paused, looking pointedly at thenboy on the far right, and said \"No relation, sir.\" Thenheavyset boy named Falk began to snicker. Emil raised his eyebrows atnhim, giving him a silent look before redirecting his attention to thennext recruit. \"You.\" \"OrelnSchwarzenbach. 14. Heil Hitler.\" \"OswaldnGehl. 14. Heil Hitler.\" \"OskarnSigg. 14. Heil Hitler.\" Emilnstopped at the end of the line, turned, and paced in the otherndirection. \"Many of you were transferred directly from the Jungvolknand therefore know what kind of routines to expect. Would anyone carento inform me what the last thing was you did there?\" Thensecond boy, Inge, raised his hand. \"We… we were working withnbows, sir.\" He said quietly. \"Archery.\" \"Here,\"nEmil had just waited for him to finish, barely listening. (He had ancurriculum to follow, regardless.) \"You will become skilled innself-defense. You will learn, if you have not already, how to use anLuger. You will spend much time in the shooting range, and know hownto throw a hand grenade. You will learn all important skills thatnwill qualify your participation in the Wehrmacht, whether you joinnthe Luftwaffe, Heer, or Kreigsmarine. This will depend on yournmembership in the Fleiger-HJ, Motor-HJ, or Marine-HJ. You will shownme, as your unit leader, as well as the Bannführer, absolutenrespect. I will be your trainer. I have neither the time or patiencento work with fools. Watch me, keep up, and you should do fine. Anynclowning around will be stopped and the instigators will benpunished.\" Emil stared down hard at the boys in an attempt tonintimidate them. Some of them were intimidated. They weren'tnsupposed to be intimidated—they were supposed to be intimidating.nBy the time they were out of here, they would know thatndifference—and well. If from nobody else, then from him. \"Hallo!\" Emilnturned around in surprise. His part of the meeting was over; thenrecruits were turned over to the Bannführer for the rest of the day,nas was he, for Emil was still a member. Jürgen and Jan, the wondernbrothers, were attempting to catch up to Emil. Emil slowed down inncourtesy, albeit with suspicion: How could a brisk walking pace whipnthese boys out of shape? Fifteennseconds later, the von Hessler brothers and Emil were walkingntogether. \"Sorry.\" Jürgen apologized, \"Our leader in thenJungvolk didn´t want us to run in the halls and that´s what we´renused to. You a Gefolgschaftsführer?\" \"Yes.\"nEmil said. \"I was promoted last year. I am supposed to continue mynjob indefinitely.\" \"Bummer.\"nJürgen replied. \"I mean, for some people. Like me. I´m going tonbe in the Luftwaffe after I leave here.\" Emilnraised an eyebrow. \"Congratulations.\" He certainly wasn´t anmodest boy. \"Donyou plan to train for the rest of your life?\" Jan asked. Emilndirected his attention to the other brother. \"No. I´ll make it tonthe Heer someday. \"Ah!nKnew you had it in you, the way you were bossing all of us aroundnjust now.\" Jürgen grinned. \"A hint of bitterness in thengentleman´s life.\" Emilnforced a smile. \"Call it what you will. I´m not bitter.\" \"Wh-oooooops.nMy apologies, frie… Sir.\" \"Hownlong have you been here, then?\" Jan asked. \"This´llnbe my fourth year. Fourth and a half.\" \"Andna-half?\" Jürgen prompted. \"Inwaited half a year before joining,\" \"Afternleaving the Jungvolk, you mean.\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" Emilnstiffened. \"Illness.\" \"Whatnkind of—\" \"Jesus,nJürgen. You´re a snoop.\" His brother teased. \"Whonare you callin´ snoopy?\" Jürgen glared at his brother. \"Andnnow I have a question for you both: why are you talking to me?\"nEmil asked. Silence.nJürgen turned slowly to his brother. Emilnsmirked, satisfied. Thenboys shrugged simultaneously. Jürgen laughed heartily. \"Fairnquestion. Fair, fair, fair.\" Emilnclosed his eyes. \"HeynJan—I think we pissed him off. Sorry sir.\" Jürgen smirked. \"Ohnno, boys. I just have a headache. A large one, as a matter of fact.\"nEmil said through gritted teeth. \"SorrynSir. We didn´t notice.\" That was Jan. \"Asndid I either.\" Jürgen said. \"What's bothering you, ma… Sir?nDo you feel alone in this war-torn world?\" \"Ifnyou weren´t going to join the Luftwaffe, Herr von Hessler, I daresaynyou would´ve made an excellent interviewer.\" \"That´snJürgen to you. And for him,\" Jan said, gesturing toward hisnbrother. \"Except he, obviously, is Jan.\" \"Bothnof you are Herren von Hesslers to me. Courtesy.\" (Emil hadnforgotten to add \"orders\" on the end.) Jürgennagain turned to his brother, slowly, and for the first time sincenmeeting him, to Emil he looked serious. \"We are men now, Bruder.nDanke amen.\" Jannfrowned. \"We've never been men before? Great.\" Emil,nironically, nearly smirked at them. Instead, he simply continuednfacing forward. \"Yes,nyou are men. And so your performance and trial will be that of men.nThis training is harder than the Jungvolk is. Expect that.\" \"Wendo and will, Sir. We will work until we are ready to defend thenFatherland, and there we will die if necessary—when we are ready.\" \"Gladnto hear it.\" Emil said idly. Jürgenncracked a grin. \"I mean it, you know. Especially about dying.nReally. I´m happy to die. Of course, my brother has to go first,nafter he´s sufficiently saved my life and apologized for every timenhe tickled me every time the guns were about to start a footrace andnwon.\" Jürgen smirked. Emilnlooked at Jan. \"Thatnwas a long time ago!\" Jan protested. \"And only once.\" Werenthese goof-ups really the best the Jungvolk had to offer. No,nthis had to be a mistake. They had to be a mistake. \"Sonthat other guy, Falk. He´s a bit of a hefty one.\" Jan muttered tonhis brother. \"Never know how he´s going to make it throughntraining—\" \"Makenit? The boy´ll never make it. Ackermann´s no better, that snob. Inswear he and the blimp are cousins.\" \"AsnI know it, the blimp is also an Ackermann, is he not?\" Jan repliednto his brother. \"Thenblimp is The Blimp. End of story.\" Jannand Jürgen howled with laughter. Emilnlagged behind the boys a good distance before making his way pastnthem and shuffling again to the front. Lagging made him sick, anyhow.nIt was his duty as a leader to stop this, but that duty had nevernbeen carried through, by the Bannführer or any other of thenGefolgschaftsführern he had known during his Hitlerjugend years. And honestly, these were trivialities when training for a war.nHe had more important things to worry about—as did everyone. If anboy couldn´t handle something like this then he should´ve beennthrown in a camp with the rest of Hitler´s leftovers. Weakness wasnfor no one, women at the bare minimum, though his father would beatnhim hard for saying that. But his father hadn´t known Anne. End ofnstory. ButnEmil didn´t want to think about his old girlfriend. Not now. Therenwas the Bannführer and his speech to worry about now, though he hadnheard it four times now. Thendoors opened to the film room and Emil was the first of his condensednunit to enter. He stood in the back. No recognition. No prize.nNothing for being the only boy to have unfairly flunked out of thenWehrmacht. His anger swelled as the slide pictures of a regular mannand a Jewish man were shown on the screen with the Bannführernpointing to them and talking. Emilnwas not trying to listen. Emil had had to listen to this atnleast a thousand times and it was unfair to make him listen again.nThe slide turned to a picture everyone knew—one of a gorilla-lippednblack man playing the saxaphone. And when Bei Mir Bist Du Schönnbegan playing and, suddenly, imbedding itself in his head with anmorbid sensual beckoning, Emil could swear that the teaching wasncomplete and utter bullshit. There was no spell with Swing.nThere may´ve been with Jews, but not with Swing. Swing maynhave been pointless and stupid, but no more than the teaching. It wasnall overrated, sickeningly overrated with a brand on music thatnneedn´t be bothered. Emil could swear, in a single moment, that all these teachings were overrated. The Jews were inferior, all right,nbut they were obviously not going to take over the world. Whynwould anybody try that undercover for hundreds of years? Besides,nthey weren´t smart enough, not by a long shot. Their spells were notnoverpowering. The Jews, indeed, were overrated- just like that trashnmusic. Emil was ready to walk away from this stupid preachingnand go to a club. Swing was stupid but at least it wasn´t preachy. Asnsoon as the veil had fallen, it was lifted. Emil now knew exactly whynhe had turned to Swing all these years ago. And he would nevernforget, not for the rest of his life. Thatnwas what he had thought at the time. Thennext slide came and Emil no longer saw red. His breathing slowed. Henhad simply been crazed, angered. He had been so for good reason. Hennever got any recognition. Hadnanyone noticed? Emil looked around. Thennew recruits of his unit stared at the Bannführer. Not a personnmoved. Any one of them could´ve heard a pin drop, but by the waynthey were acting now, no one would´ve dared turn around to see it.nThese recruits didn´t have such a long way to go after all.[Chapter 4] 26nmembers of Emil's unit, including the recruits, were standing in ansmall practice room with a boxing/wrestling ring in the center. Thenday-old recruits' vigor had disappeared to nowhere in particular,nas they leaned on the walls and sat whenever possible. They weren'tngoing to get off so easily. \"Werenany of you taught how to wrestle in the Jungvolk ?\" Emilnasked, carefully eyeing the group of recruits, packed together in thenback. \"Yesnsir, but only the basics.\" Inge called across the room. \"Todaynyou will all learn to wrestle. One of the most important componentsnin your favor is a firm stance. Stand with your feet shoulder-widthnapart.\" Allnthe boys complied. \"Nownbend your knees. Keep your back straight. Herr Mauhler, what wasntaught in the Jungvolk ? Were the Bridge and Headlock covered?\" \"No,nsir.\" \"Partners:nHerr Mauhler, Herr Schwarzenbach. Herr Gehl, Herr Sigg. HerrnAckermann and Herr Ackermann. Falknshuffled his feet and Artur sighed. \"I told you we weren'tnrelated.\" \"Benquiet.\" Emil barked. Arturnstraightened up and went to stand beside Falk. He didn't have tonmove; Falk was joining him. \"Herrnvon Hessler and Herr von Hessler. Herr Abrahamsen and Herr Schmidt.nHerr Ferenbacher, Herr Abrell. Herr Stief, Herr Kolberg. HerrnKossler, Herr Gille. Herr Krueger, Herr Heike. Herr Zimmermen, HerrnBrosmer. Herr Neuer. Herr Rad, Herr Salge. Herr Stein, Herr Thompsen.nWe'll go over some basic wrestling moves. First, we will do thenHeadlock. Would anyone like to demonstrate the headlock with me?\" Severalnboys raised their hands. None of them was a new recruit. \"HerrnAbrell. Thank you for volunteering.\" Thenboy stepped under the ropes and into the ring. Emil, who had beennstanding directly in front of the ring, did the same. \"We willnbegin with the Headlock. Wrap your arm around your opponent'snneck.\" Emilnlet the younger boy (albeit the same height) wrap an elbow around hisnneck. \"Takenyour opponent down.\" Emil knocked Abrell to the ground. He lay onnhis back. Abrellnrose, weaving his arm under Emil's and pressing it against the backnof Emil's head. \"Thatnwas a poorly attempted Half-Nelson. Keep your feet closer together.\"nEmil twisted out of the grip and again knocked his opponent to thenground. \"Footwork. Always keep a firm stance as your base.\" Hendropped down to his knees and pinned Abrell to the floor. \"Pin yournopponent to the ground by applying pressure to his shoulders. Thanknyou, Herr Abrell.\" Abrell,npeeved, dove under the ring and rejoined the mildly roused audience. \"ThenArm Bar, Bridge, and Cradle are next. Any new volunteers?\" Thenboys didn't budge, their confidence gone. \"HerrnAbrell, would you join me?\" Abrell,nagain, walked up and into the ring, more slowly this time. \"ThenArm Bar is another lock, like the Headlock. Watch carefully.\" Abrellnlooked at his mentor uncertainly. Emilnsuppressed a smirk. Abrell had been well put in his place. \"Placenyour arm over your opponent's elbow and behind his back and hold.\"nHe waited for Abrell and smirked, knocking him to the ground. \"ThenBridge is one of the most useful defensive moves. Arch your back awaynfrom the mat, using your arms and legs. This takes flexibility. Itnprevents your opponent from pinning you.\" Abrellnrose from the mat after doing the Bridge and stood behind Emil. \"ThenCradle—\" Abrellnstopped in his tracks. \"isna commonly-seen move. Pick up your opponent. Place one arm around hisnneck and the other behind his knee. Get both knees if you have thentime to.\" Emil picked Abrell up. \"As such.\" Severalnof the boys snickered. \"Dragnyour opponent's knees up to his face.\" Emil curled Abrell'snlanguid body up into a ball, lifting him above his head, and walkingnto and fro to show all the boys the position. \"The next move wouldnbe to throw him on the ground.\" Emil dropped Abrell. \"Spread outnand practice.\" Abrellnsheepishly ducked under the rope and went to the very back of thengroup, pressing his back against the wall. Boysnwere always more apt with physical activities; the pattern neverndeceived. Emil walked around the partners, shirking some odd limbsnand moves, giving no advice. The von Hessler brothers were goofingnoff with just as much confidence as they used performing the movesnthemselves without skipping a beat. Jürgen had taken to locking Jannin the Cradle and jogging laps around the room, like an Olympic torchncarrier, several times in the past few minutes, perhaps hoping tongain attention. The only consequence: no one was paying attention tonthem. Emil,nhaving long ago learned to keep half his mind stay rooted firmlynsomewhere and let other half meander free, noted idly that the boysnwere no longer spread out. \"Staynspread apart.\" Emil reminded loudly. \"Practice is almost o—\" \"Looknat 'em go!\" Jürgen whispered, as if he were face-to-face withnGoethe * himself. \"Thatnchubster's good! Ackermann doesn't stand a chance!\" Jannreplied, eyes following the same target, equally shocked. Emil,ntaller than most of the boys, could successfully look over most ofnthem to see what he assumed was the source of the excitement. In thenvery center of the crown crouched a boy on the floor, holdingnanother, more heavy-set, boy in place. He had assumed correctly.nKnowing that the heavy one was Falk Ackermann, the other boy had tonbe Artur Ackermann. \"Isn'tnhe going to get up?\" A boy near him complained. \"Yes.nWatch. Chubs can't stay on the floor forever.\" His companionnreplied, bug-eyed. Thenheftier Ackermann sprang up, sending the punier one off to the side.nHe landed on his back. \"That'snenough.\" Emil said loudly. \"That's enough.\" Ackermannnhoisted a leg in each arm, nearly lifting his opponent completely offnthe ground, and stepped over one, dropping him on the groundnface-down. \"ONE!nTWO! THREE!\" Jan von Hessler yelled. \"Four.nFive. Six. Seven.\" Jürgen counted with his brother. \"Eight.nNine. TEN!!!!!!!!\" \"Going,ngoing—gone!\" Jan beamed. \"And… Ackermann wins!\" \"Shhhhh.\"nJürgen placed a finger over his lips, eyeing the area to see ifnEmil—their trainer—was nearby.\" \"HerrnLutz is okay.\" Jan said, familiar with his brother's neverendingnconcern. \"Maybe,nbut he could put in a bad word for us.\" The elder brother lowerednhis voice. \"I can't take that risk. We have to tone it down, Jan.nWe aren't kids anymore. Don't you want to be able to join thenLuftwaffe?\" \"Whatevernyou say, Jürg, whatever you say.\" Jan chuckled. Silence. \"Itnis now our sacred duty to grab Ackermann and celebrate.\" Jürgen'snface split into a grin. Face flushed from practicing, he lookednrather like a deranged pumpkin. \"Ackermann?nWhat happened to the Blimp?\" Jan asked with a knowing smile. It, ofncourse, had been a rhetorical question. \"Herrennvon Hesslers?\" Emil walked over to them. Bothnboys looked intently at him. \"Keepnit down, please.\" \"YesnSir.\" Jürgen replied. He and Jan walked over to where FalknAckermann was standing and shaking hands with Artur Ackermann with ansemi-sour expression on his face. Emil followed with his eyes. Takingninto consideration the features of the boys' faces, still not atnall near the intensity of that fight he had had with Thomas. \"Sonhow come you never talk about her?\" \"Who?\" \"Yournold girlfriend.\" Jürgen said, winking at him. \"We know all aboutnher.\" Ackermannnsighed. \"Okay… what's your name? Jan? I don't have angirlfriend.\" \"Well,nwe know you don't have one any more .\" Jürgen smirked. \"I'mnJan, by the way. Who was she?\" \"I'vennever had a girlfriend in my life.\" Falk replied stiffly. \"Never?nNever?\" \"HJsnaren't supposed to have girlfriends, anyway.\" \"Whonsays?\" \"Justnheard it around.\" \"Heardnwhat around?\" \"ThatnHJ members are sexually deprived by definition.\" Falk cracked angrin. Bothnboys roared with laughter. \"Well,nno matter. We're getting him a girl.\" Jürgen stage-whispered tonhis brother. \"Hencan hear you.\" Jan smirked back. \"Wonderful.\"nJürgen turned back to Falk, grinning from ear to ear. \"What do younthink, then, Ackermann?\" Falkndid a double-take and looked in instinct at Artur. and his friendsnwere all on the ground, perfecting their own version of the Bridgenand collapsing, their bodies trembling noticeably at every attempt.n\"Him?\" He pointed behind his shoulder. \"Va?nThat Scheißer? He has no nam…\" Jürgen said loudly, beforenlaughing. \"What the hell is he doing? He looks like he's…\" \"Havingna baby.\" Jan finished, smiling. Thenboys smirked at each other. \"What'snthat, Frau?!\" Jürgen yelled with a hand cupped over his mouth.n\"How far along? It is a little boy or a little girl?\" \"That'snwhat his girlfriend looks like.\" Jan added sagely. \"Must havengotten her pregnant.\" Arturnglared and walked away with his friends. \"That took care of Puny.nHe's a queer one.\" Jürgen said in an undertone to Jan and Falk. \"Whyndo you think he's so… stuck-up?\" Jan asked. \"What'snit to us to know?\" Jürgen shrugged. \"If he's an asshole, he'snan asshole. We'll just stay away from him… right,nAckermann-with-no-relation?\" Falknhad walked away. Jürgennclapped his hands once, then followed him. \"Inknow a marvelous girl in the BDM who would be just fine for you. Justnjoined a month ago.\" Falknsighed. \"Didn't I tell you that HJ members never getngirlfriends?\" \"Neitherndo BDMs. It'd be a perfect fit.\" \"Ifnyou're tricking me…\" \"Inbelieve you.\" Jan cut across him, having seen the recent fight asnclearly as any other. \"And he does, too. Time to believe us now?nBitte?\" \"Wenlove girls; we know lots of them.\" Jürgen assured. \"She's verynpretty.\" \"Ach.nGirlfriends are no good to the world.\" Henreally had this world pegged, then, thought Emil, overhearing. \"Thatnis not so, I am afraid.\" Jürgen nodded sadly. \"Don'tnworry about it. Girlfriends really aren't any good to the world, ifnyou think about it. Neither are women. My sister will be in the BDM ancouple years from now and I'm almost sorry for her, what they teachnthere. Cooking. Cleaning.\" Jan wrinkled his nose. \" Camping .nBut they can't fight, of course. That's the way things are.\" \"Shame,nreally. But Elfi's a swell girl. She likes manly-men, too. Won'tnlook at a guy if he's not in the Hitlerjugend , little vixen.nAnd look at you! You beat down Puny here down pretty good awhilenago.\" \"Andnwe'll never have girlfriends when we're pilots.\" \"No,nonly time when girlfriends are really useless.\" \"Sonenjoy her while you can.\" The boys chorused. \" Anyhow ,\"nJan began, \"what do we do now? Practice is over.\" \"Mmm-mmm.nHerr Lutz hasn't said so yet.\" \"No?\" \"Henwas probably given instructions for us to go until a certain time.nLook—some of us are still practicing.\" \"Speakingnof which, we'd better find our partners and at least pretend tonbefore he catches us, as well.\" \"Jürg,nhe won't do anything!\" \"Let'snnot take our chances.\" Jürgen lowered his voice. \"They're morenserious here, Jan. We can't go around disrespecting the trainers.nHere, it's about absolute conformity.\" \"Wasn'tnthat what it was about in the Jungvolk ? Isn't that what thenNSDAP is about?\" \"Yes,nit should be, I suppose.\" \"Thennwhat are you worried about? We're fine. Father said thenBannführer was eager to make our arrangement last year and excitednto have us join the Hitlerjugend this year.\" \"They'renshort on members.\" \"Donyourself a favor, Jürg, and shut up. Would you look at that?nAckermann's gone again.\" \"Good.nNone of us will get in trouble, the—\" \"Practicenis over. There will be a competition at the end of this week. Thenwinner will be rewarded with an entry in his Leistungsbuch.\" Emilnannounced. \"For the rest of the week you will be trained in simplenself-defense skills as a review; next week we will begin work withnLugers. My work with you is done for today. You will now report tonthe Bannführer.\" Emil said. \"Follow me.\" Itnhad taken Emil three months to memorize the surname of every man innhis unit, which had amounted to a total of nearly one hundred andnsixty names. It had taken him twelve times that long to earn thenranking of Gefolgschaftsführer. It had taken him that divided bynthree to get over his Swing craze. These things he had calculatednlong ago. Long ago he had been the same person, produced the samenthoughts, and followed the same path until it was cut short. Itnwas what he didn't know that he feared most. *Johannnvon Goethe was a very famous German poet. Many of his writings werenlater converted to songs.[Chapter 5] Eight months later – July, 1941 \"Hold your non-throwing arm out. The grenade should land fifteen meters away. Get down immediately after the throw—you don't want to be visible to the enemy.\" Emil paused. \"Throw!\" Inge's grenade landed no more than ten feet outside the pit and lay there morosely. Despairingly, he looked at his trainer. \"Don't throw at the ground.\" Emil barked. \"Let go of the grenade while your arm is still high. Down, Herr Mauhler. Get down.\" Inge ducked. \"Next person in line, enter the pit.\" The pits were narrow areas that resembled stalls. There were eight pits lined up in a row, Emil's entire unit stationed behind them. The shooting range had been keenly transformed for grenade training today. Army procedures created a larger role for the Gefolgschaftsführern for their original purposes—control over their unit. Roughly two thirds of Emil's unit had thrown. They were in line behind the boys who hadn't. Most of the boys left were new recruits. \"Position.\" Pause. Eight boys, few of them recruits, swiftly held their non-throwing arms out, each keeping the arm with the grenade close to his chest. \"Throw.\" Eight heads disappeared. Eight training grenades flew through the air semi-expertly. They made indignant popping noises as they detonated, all within seconds each other. \"Next person, in the pit. Don't lag!\" The von Hessler brothers stepped up to their pits, agitated beads of sweat piercing their tendrils and soaking them. It was a mildly hot day today, not what Hamburgers was used to. \"Position! Herr Ferenbacher, move more quickly. Don't make yourself a target to the enemy. Throw!\" Ppop-pop-pop-Pppop-pop. \"Next!\" Oskar, Artur, and Oswald moved up with five more recruits. \"Position!\" He watched them closely. \"Throw!\" Of the recruits, only two of them had made the suggested fifteen meters. Emil sighed. \"Throw harder!\" was about the advice he could give at this point. \"Next!\" The eight boys stood and departed the pits. Oswald yelled \"Yes Sir!\" Artur curtly jerked his head up and down. Oskar stumbled and wiped the sweat off his brow. There were only four new lines left. All behind them had thrown. The eighty or so '40 and '41 recruits in his unit were not doing as badly as Emil had first predicted. Still, there was no room for mistakes, and they were making too many. Falk and Orel were with the next eight. Both of them were crippled by the sun's heat. Falk walked upright and stiffly. Orel stumbled along, much like Oskar. Falk had lost a considerable amount of weight from the training, and was even good-looking now, albeit short. It was strange, nearly comical, to see Orel, the taller-framed boy, compose himself in an awkward manner and Falk, still pudgy, retain the true Jugend stride. \"Position!\" Emil was tempted to wipe his brow. \"Throw!\" If only grenades could be launched from a bow as arrows were. Half the boys, who had been fine archers, lost their talent in drawing upon their own arm strength. \"Throw hard! Release grenade while your arm is in mid-air, not while it is pointing toward the ground! Your movements must be swift and confident! Get down immediately after the grenade is thrown! Next!\" Two seventeen-year-olds, four sixteen-year-olds, and two recruits. They would never win the war with fighters like these on a battlefield, unless they completed another round. \"Position! Throw!\" Emil, standing behind the lines, could not measure how far the grenades would go until they had landed. A bold, short wall indicated the end of fifteen meters. It was the mark that the boys' grenades would have to pass if they would ever be able to consider themselves true soldiers. Hitler's true men were flawless fighters; advocators and appliers of bravery. They would never fall. They could never fall. There were simply too few of those kind fighting right now.* \"Next!\" Eight more boys. \"Position! Throw! Next!\" Eight more boys: last time. \"Position! Throw!\" The boys stumbled doggedly out of their formation. \"Get back in line for another round!\" Emil yelled. The boys stopped in their tracks and looked behind them at Emil. \"This is unacceptable! If you don't quit throwing like half-wits then look forward to staying out here until sunset!\" A groan came from the boys, building and rising quickly to a shriek of indignation. They sidled back to their lines, from which no one had moved very far. The original line yielded to the last line as the components of it staggered to the very back, throwing Emil subtle glares. Emil respired silently. \"Position!\" He yelled. Jürgen and Jan ran up to Emil immediately after the second round had ended (sufficiently). \"How'd we do?\" Jürgen asked eagerly. \"You boys did fine.\" Emil smiled at them. \"As usual.\" \"Better than most of them, right?\" Jan prompted. \"It was only right, making us do it over.\" Jürgen smiled thoughtfully. \"Our friend is wise, is he not?\" \"Perhaps.\" Emil said vaguely. Discussing training methods with a student was utterly out of the question. Jürgen should have known that by now. \"Very.\" Said Jan absently. \"Alas! My brother is tired!\" Jürgen smiled. \"Are we doing anything else, Herr Lutz?\" \"No, but we are reviewing Lugers tomorrow.\" Emil smiled at Jürgen. \"You and Jan are doing well and have nothing to worry about.\" \"No, nothing but my girlfriend.\" Jürgen's smile faded. \"She is causing me… problems.\" Emil laughed. \"What kind of problems?\" \"Only problems a—\" \"Girl could cause.\" Emil finished for him. \"She won't talk to me until I buy her a birthday present.\" Jürgen rolled his eyes. \"Fran's such a brat. Maybe I won't buy her a thing. She doesn't deserve anything, that's for sure.\" He smirked. \"Treat women mean and they'll leave you.\" Emil said. \"Treat them nice and they'll do the same thing. Learned it the hard way.\" \"And haven't got a girlfriend since, eh?\" \"That's right. And now I have a successful theory about women.\" \"Proof?\" \"That your Fransizka is exactly the same as my old girlfriend.\" \"Implying?\" \"That woman are indeed much inferior to men. There is no variety, which indicates lack of complexity in their brains and thinking patterns.\" Jürgen chuckled. \"Ah. Harsh. But that is a fact that men have known for hundreds of years.\" \"Do you suppose the women have found out yet?\" Jan asked. \"Surely not.\" Emil said. \"No. They'll probably never find out, poor things.\" Jürgen laughed. \"Probably not.\" Emil repeated. \"You're serious, aren't you?\" Jürgen asked Emil, laughing harder. \"You've got them pegged then, Herr Lutz, if a little bit too much so.\" \"Girls are ditzy, yes. The only girl who isn't is the girl you eventually marry.\" Jan said. \"That is true.\" Jürgen replied. \"Perhaps.\" \"But my girlfriend promises to visit me, and never does. Then she complains that I'm neglecting her ! She has nothing better to do than go to school and pinning it all on me ! She's so silly I almost like her.\" Jürgen grinned lazily. \"I think you do.\" Jan joked. \"To have been seeing her for so long.\" *\"I think that she's blackmailed me and I don't know it.\" Jürgen replied, without missing a beat. \"Or so, that's just an excuse.\" \"Or so, you're making a big deal out of what isn't.\" Jürgen was vexed. \"Or you're losing your temper because you're being contradictory.\" Both boys laughed and hung arms around each other, walking off into the distance as they talked about some new topic. Emil had been lost since the beginning. He probably wasn't even supposed to keep boys training under him as his companions. But there was no one else and certainly no one else his own age. Thomas had been his friend, once upon a time. All things considered, no one could replace Thomas. And friendship was just as useless as romance. Being in the presence of the von Hessler brothers peeved him in a way that only Thomas could. Emil hadn't been lying when he had confessed to having a theory about women. He had a theory about friendship as well. The next day was Lugers. The boys had had to take down the pits and replace the throw line with targets. The day began at dawn. The war had begun accelerating. The program had grown yet more rigorous. It was not just about the older ones who were ready to leave the Hitlerjugend ; it was about those who would be called in case of emergency. As a trainer, the war was none of his business. Emil was not fighting in it. Not now. Not yet. \"Always keep your eyes on the target.\" Emil ordered his sleep-logged unit. \"Keep both eyes open and alert. Aim for the target. Do not aim for anything other than the target. All this, you should remember.\" He gazed at the members in his unit to make sure that every one was listening. \"When on the battlefield: there is no time for thought. There is no time for mercy. War is won by casualties, as are victories. And alertness—\" He shoved a nearby recruit to test his balance. \"Is the basis for your own victory. You must kill to survive. Today I expect no sluggards or dunces. You must be as quick in mind as you had to be quick in movement in practice yesterday. Get in your lines.\" The boys, just as unmotivated as they had been a minute before, complied. Emil had expected nothing more of them. \"First one in line, step up.\" Eight boys, as yesterday, crawled forward. One of them stumbled and fell to the ground, over the shooting line. \"Herr Schmidt,\" Emil said coldly. \"If Hitler had wanted someone with coordination such as yours, he surely would not have been disappointed upon visiting a bar. The next person who trips today will be punished. Ready.\" Emil paused for a few seconds, waiting for the boys to resume their positions in front of the shooting line. \"Aim.\" Each boy lifted a Luger from his left and pointed it at his target. \"Shoot.\" It was here he slept every night, and here he woke every day, solemnly circumspect. It was here where he faced no surprises. Emil woke at the same time every day, in the same room. He never took naps; taking naps was bad for the overall concentration and mental balance of a man. He had never slept anywhere else a day in his life. Even when he and Anne… . His parents were downstairs, talking, always talking, talking for as long as he could remember. Nothing had ever changed in his life, really. Life would be different once he left Hamburg to begin his assistance for the victory of the Fatherland. Life would Change. Emil didn't embrace change or dread it; there was simply no time. There was scarcely time to forget; he remembered so much by habit. Hell, he hadn't forgotten anything since Anne… . Emil rose and changed into his uniform. He left his room and closed the door. He descended the stairs nearest to his room, the ones that led to the dining room. The slim shadow of Frau Lutz stood in the very center of the room, gazing at the chandelier. Her husband stood beside her, his tall frame blocking the little light that eminated from the room. He gripped a cane, as he always would. They stood at a forty-five degree angle away from the adjacent wall, their backs still to their son. They whispered, to avoid waking him. Emil hated whispering; he heard whether he was asleep or not. Having his choice to eavesdrop or not, he decided not to. \"Mother. Father.\" \"Good morning, Emil.\" Frau Lutz smiled at her son. \"How are you this morning?\" \"Well.\" Emil said. \"As always.\" \"Have you eaten?\" \"No. I will soon.\" \"Good. Rolf is preparing breakfast for us.\" \"That is good.\" \"Is your training going well?\" Herr Lutz asked tentatively. \"Yes. It is going well.\" \"Don't worry, Emil. You'll leave. I'm sure they'll release you soon. I still don't like this about the Bannführer holding you back.\" \"Though he did it because you are a good student and a good trainer.\" Frau Lutz assured. \"They'll be needing more soldiers. Soon they'll need you.\" She smiled at Emil. \"Damn right they will. Emil's not getting cheated of anything—\" \"Of course not, Georg. Emil will be the best one fighting. He will fight.\" \"Yes, Father. I will. They promised to let me go.\" Knopp hadn't promised anything. But a place in the war—a real place, not this training bullshit—was a God-given right. If the war passed by without Emil's participation, Knopp would hear about it—from Herr Lutz, at least. \"Rolf—where is Rolf? Rolf.\" Frau Lutz snapped. Rolf, the family's cook and butler, rushed into the room. \"Frau?\" \"Rolf, where is our breakfast?\" She chuckled. \"It is early, yes, but our son is a busy man.\" Rolf left the room, returning with the family's breakfast: ham. \"My apologies, Frau, I misunderstood you to mean that I was to bring breakfast later—\" \"You did, you did. I apologize for snapping at you. For, where would this family be without a good butler?\" \"Katarine,\" Herr Lutz began, as soon as Rolf was gone. \"I'm afraid that—\" \"Does this have to do with Rolf?\" Frau Lutz cut across him. \"We've made Rolf's—issues—known to the authorities for years, but since things have tightened so much since last year—\" \"What, because he is a criminal? He is a good worker! I will not have—\" \"What will we tell them? I'm not sure they'll let him go this year.\" \"That he is a good worker! They have no right to take away our butler! Where do they get that right—\" \"Katarine!\" Herr Lutz barked. \"What, Georg ? I don't like the fact that they're taking something that belongs to us—\" \"Do not speak that way of us, Katarine.\" Herr Lutz warned. Herr Lutz was a strong Nazi Party member. He had not missed a meeting in over ten years. When he was a youth, he was one of Hitler's stormtroopers, rounded up in Berlin with the others when he had been released from jail. He had met his wife in Hamburg and married her there. Somehow the Lutzs had never gotten back to Berlin. Frau Lutz sighed. \"You're right. I am sorry, Georg. But times are hard, no? We cannot afford a new butler.\" \"What if the authorities would compensate?\" Herr Lutz sighed. \"But they wouldn't. We wouldn't.\" \"Compensation is good. But who knows if we even want a person like Rolf in our house anymore. We can get better. Times are hard; times are hard…\" Silence. Emil ate his breakfast thoughtfully. They had held onto Rolf for too long now, being the type of person that he is. That was dull news. However, his father flaring up against his mother—taking into consideration that Herr Lutz had always considered his wife as almost an equal—was strange. Emil stood, glancing at his. \"I must go now.\" Herr and Frau Lutz beamed at their son. \"Good luck with training.\" Herr Lutz said. \"Thank you.\" Emil replied. He walked across the dining room to the long hallway that led to the front door. Today, the boys would learn the basics of driving and controlling a tank. Emil's entire unit was composed of Motor-HJ members. In addition, they would learn the advanced procedure of throwing a grenade from the ground, in continuation to their lesson two days ago.

It is set four years later, so Michael is 15 and Debbie is 14. I hope you enjoy it! What Happened Next - Debbie And Michael Debbie Wilkinson clambered onto the bus and plonked herself down on an empty seat. An old woman walked past, glancing at Debbie, and Debbie glared back. But when the woman had turn her back, Debbie pulled her coat further down over her tutu, embarrassed. There had once been days when she had been proud to let people see her in her ballet clothes. When she had gone home humming Mr. Braithwaite's merry songs. When she had rehearsed the new steps in her head, her feet tapping along sub-consciously. She didn't see the point of that anymore though. She didn't see the point of anything. The bus doors opened with a hiss of steam and a boy stepped in. He was short, like Debbie, and his unruly hair curled around his face like a chocolate-brown halo. He looked around the bus, searching for an empty seat. The only one was next to Debbie. The boy noticed this, and his cheeks turned a bright shade of pink. He stood there, he eyes fixed on the empty seat, until the bus driver called out; 'C'mon, lad, we 'aven't got all day!' The boy turned pinker, but did as he was told and sat down next to Debbie, on the far side of his seat so they wouldn't touch. Wanker. Debbie turned to the window angrily and searched through her old ballet satchel until she found a cherry lollipop. Her Mam had packed one for every day since her first ballet class. Now, she gazed longingly at the crimson gleam of it, before opening the window and tossing the lollipop out. She hadn't eaten a sweet in 4 years, not since he left, and wasn't about to start now. Her body had shrunk from that of a plump little girl's, to a thin graceful woman's, the body of a real ballet dancer. And with it, had shrunk her happiness. She only wished he could see her now. He would be so impressed. Then again, maybe not. The boy in seat next to Debbie glanced up at her, nervously, as if he was considering whether or not to leg it. Finally, Debbie could stand it no more. 'What is your bloody problem?!' she snapped at the boy. He jumped like Debbie had had slapped him. 'Nothing' he mumbled. 'Then why are you looking at me like you're a puppy that I just kicked in the 'ead?' 'No reason, it's just... You're familiar.' 'We don't know each other' said Debbie, turning back to the window. 'No, really, we do. At least, I'm sure I know you' the boy said frowning with concentration and frustration. Debbie glanced back at him. His eyes were the colour of the sea. 'I've heard that line before mate, a million times. You're wasting your time' Debbie insisted. 'I'm not chatting you up' the boy murmured, going pink again. 'I swear. I'm Michael.' Debbie rolled her eyes and turned back to face him fully. 'Michael what?' 'Michael Caffrey' Debbie frowned. The name was familiar. 'I'm Debbie. Debbie Wilkinson' The boys face lit up with realization. 'Yeah! Mrs Wilkinson's daughter!' 'No shit, Sherlock.' sighed Debbie. She was beginning to feel dizzy. She hadn't eaten lunch or breakfast after all. 'I mean... the ballet teacher's daughter. Billy's teacher. Billy's old teacher anyway' Debbie sat bolt upright. The dizziness was gone. Billy... Billy Elliot. Debbie hadn't spoken that name, hadn't even dared to think of that name in 4 long years. 'You know Billy, don't you? Knew him. Whatever' said Michael. 'I... I don't know who you're talking about. Billy? That's a boy's name! Mam never taught a boy to dance!' Debbie stammered, though her voice shook even as she said it. 'I miss him too...' sighed Michael, leaning back in his seat. When Debbie looked closer, she saw the tears in his eyes. 'He talked about you a lot, if that makes you feel better' Debbie said quietly. 'When he he was at ballet, I mean' Michael said nothing, but she could tell that her words had pleased him. The tears left his beautiful eyes and a small, secret smile formed on his rosy lips. The two sat in silence for a few minutes, Debbie staring at Michael, Michael staring at the fan on the ceiling. 'You haven't, like, heard from 'im have you? Or seen 'im?' said Michael, not taking his gaze off the fan. 'Nah. You're more likely to than I am, you were his best mate after all. What was I to 'im? Nothing' Debbie muttered, her throat closing up. 'I don't think so.' Said Michael simply. 'What do you mean? What would you know anyway?' Debbie said, blinking away her tears that threatened to spill down her cheeks. 'I felt the same way you did. Still do, really. Felt that I was nothing to Billy. But then you realize that no one knew what they were to Billy. I don't. You don't. His Dad definitely doesn't. His brother doesn't either, but he pretends not to care...' Michael sounded like he was going to say more, but instead his words drifted off into some unknown corner of his mind. 'We ought to see him. Go down to the school, I mean. Find out how he is.' Michael stared at Debbie, a new look about him. 'I didn't know... I mean, I never knew you cared about...' 'I don't. I mean, I was just thinking, since YOU miss so much, we could...' Debbie didn't finish. She didn't have to. Both of them were clearly thinking the same thing. 'Let's meet here, first thing tomorrow morning' said Michael, standing up. There was a gleam in his eye like Debbie had never seen before. 'You're on.' Michael shot her one last deliriously happy look, before getting off the bus. 'But wait a second, Michael, what about-' the doors slammed shut behind Michael. '...Money' Debbie stared after the retreating figure of the boy. There was a feeling in her stomach that she hadn't felt for years, back when she cared about things like ballet recitals and when her homework was due in. It was butterflies. Nerves. Excitement. All the things Normal Debbie couldn't and wouldn't stand. But New Debbie was absolutely loving it.[Chapter 2] Debbie and Michael sat in a large, empty, gleaming glass waiting room. 'Thanks, again' whispered Michael, sheepishly. 'The money thing kind of slipped my mind...' Debbie rolled her eyes. 'Don't worry about it. Mam's happy for us to go and see Billy. At least, I think she is. She said some weird stuff...' 'What kind of stuff?' 'She never said it outright but... I don't know' 'What?' said Michael staring in to Debbie dull brown eyes as if the world depended on it. 'She gave me the money for the journey and all that, then she started telling me this story... about her best friend from school, who'd gotten a gig in some West End ballet show or somethin'.' 'So?' 'Mam said she went down to see the show and went visit her friend in the dressin' rooms afterwards. But her mate didn't want to know. She'd gotten all hoity-toity and thought herself better than everyone else.' 'Your Mam's not trying to say that Billy...?' said Michael. 'I don't know. All I know is that the story was a load of bull. Her best friend from school was Hetty Green from down the road and the most performing she's done is the pub karaoke when she's totally pissed.' 'Billy wouldn't! Your Mam's talking rubbish' hissed Michael indignantly. Debbie looked at him sideways. 'You don't have to convince me. I agree with you' 'Oh. Sorry. It's just that I can't bear when people talk shit about Billy. He was, is the best lad anyone could ever have for a... mate. Though, what do I know? I haven't seen 'im for years, he might be a total arse now.' Michael murmured, his voice cracking. 'He won't be' said Debbie reaching over and squeezing Michael's hand. Michael didn't squeeze back. In fact, he looked a little uncomfortable, but he smiled at Debbie all the same. 'Deborah Wilkinson and Michael Caffrey?' called out a bored-looking woman from the front desk. Debbie snorted with suppressed laughter. 'Why is she calling us by name? We're the only ones in the bloody waiting room' 'Shhh!' hissed Michael going pink. He jumped up and practically ran to the desk. Bless, thought Debbie, grinning. She got up and strolled over to the desk lazily. The lady frowned down at the two of them, disapprovingly. 'Well? Can I help you with something?' she snarled. 'Please, we're here to see Billy. Billy Elliot?' stammered Michael. The woman looked blank. 'He's been at the school for four years and he...' Michael drifted off. 'I'll look him up in the system' said the woman, sighing as if this was an extreme effort. Debbie clenched her fists. 'Well, if this such a bloody chore for you-' Debbie shouted, before Michael jammed a hand over her mouth. The woman raised her eyebrows but said nothing. Michael released Debbie, who glared at him. Michael may have been short, but he was still a good deal taller than Debbie. Debbie hadn't noticed it before. She also hadn't noticed how large his hands were. Or how strong he was. 'Elliot, Elliot, Elliot...' said the woman, frowning. 'What did you say his first name was?' 'Billy' said Michael reverently, as if he were saying 'God'. 'Ah, you mean William. Sweet boy' said the woman smiling. 'Why are you here? Is he expecting you?' 'Yes. Well, no... I mean...' Michael couldn't finish. 'We're his cousins' said Debbie triumphantly. 'He's not expecting us... until next week, that is, but we've had to come early and he wouldn't want to miss us.' Michael stared at Debbie in awe, but the woman just frowned, unconvinced. Thank goodness she seemed to be getting bored with them. 'I highly doubt it, miss. But just this once I'll turn a blind eye. He's in dorm 41. That's on the 4th floor. Wait for him outside, his class will be over in 10 minutes.' The two children hurried away, before she could change her mind, Michael making quiet thanks, Debbie sniffing. By the time the two of them had found dorm 41, they could already hear the laughter and chatter of young boys running up the stairs. Michael grabbed Debbie's hand sub-consciously. He could feel his heart beating so hard he thought it might burst. Tears were filling his eyes and he was having to breath harder than usual. This was it. Billy was coming.[Chapter 3] A boy ran up to Debbie and Michael, the last remains laughter from some unknown joke fading from his face. He was fair, like Billy, but it wasn't like Billy's dark golden-blonde. It was so blonde it was practically white and, again unlike Billy's unruly mane, it was slicked back with some sort of gel. His eyes were blue, but not like Billy's warm, welcoming turquoise. Instead, they were a cold baby blue, like ice. The boy stared at them. 'Do you mind if I… um. Well, uh, sorry, but… this is… well, my dorm' stuttered the boy, shifting uncomfortably. He didn't sound unpleasant in the slightest. His voice was tinged with an posh, London accent. 'Sorry…' said Michael, going red again. 'We were looking for… Billy?' Michael had thought for a second about saying 'William', but couldn't bring himself to do it. Billy was called BILLY. And he always would be. 'Ah' said the boy, his face clearing. 'That explains it. I'm his roommate.' 'Roommate' said Michael, swallowing hard. 'Yes. Name's Charlie. And you?' Charlie smiled at the two brightly. 'Debbie' said Debbie, sensing that Michael may be too overcome to answer. He was still holding her hand. 'And this is Michael.' 'Nice to meet you. How do you know Billy, then?' 'Friends. We've known him forever.' said Michael, meaningfully. 'And are you two, like…' Charlie gestured to Michael and Debbie's clasped hands. 'No!' Michael practically yelled, dropping Debbie's hand. Debbie's stomach dropped at the same time. She shook her head hard, by way of answering Charlie's question, but found that her eyes were stinging. Charlie just looked amused. Michael saw his smirk and wanted to punch him in the throat. 'Well, you'd better come in and wait for Billy. He'll only be a few minutes.' Charlie pushed between Debbie and Michael, opening the door behind them. 'Welcome to dorm 41.' The room was small, but homely. On either side of the door was a mirror and a sink. Directly opposite the door was a large, open window, curtains gently swaying in the breeze. Charlie went over to the left side of the room, where a single bed stood, feet end facing the door. At the end of the bed of a wardrobe, pushed up against the wall. Charlie chucked his bag on the floor and sat down on the bed, turning on a lamp that sat on a bedside table under the window. 'Make yourselves at home' smiled Charlie. Debbie sat silently down next to Charlie, still blinking. 'So,' she croaked, trying to make her throat feel less tight. 'How long have you been at the school then?' As Charlie and Debbie talked, Michael turned to the right side of the room, which mirrored the left exactly. He walked slowly over to the bed, not daring to sit on it. He stroked the duvet, carefully, his eyes welling up. He stared at the pillow, which had a soft dent in it from where Billy had lain his head every night for four years. Michael had waited so long for this moment, but now that it had arrived, he wanted nothing more than to turn back and go home. He couldn't bear it if Billy had changed into some posh, blabbering fool, like Charlie. Charlie was nice enough, but he wasn't like Billy, not even close. Michael wanted the OLD Billy, not some new one. He wanted the kind, innocent dancing boy he had once known. He wanted to take the Billy he knew in his mind and hug him to himself, never letting go. Michael turned to Debbie to propose that they left. That's when the door burst open.[Chapter 4] The first thing that Billy saw was Debbie, but not as he remembered her. It was quite definitely Debbie, but a Debbie who wouldn't dream of sucking a sweet red lollipop. A Debbie who was slim and graceful, not chubby and awkward. A Debbie who's kind, innocent had dimmed, to show eyes that had seen far too much before their time. She sat on Charlie's bed, these new eyes fixed on Billy. She didn't speak. She didn't move. She just stared. Billy sensed that she was waiting for him to do something, but what. For some inexplicable reason, he felt as if he was under pressure, like saying or doing the wrong thing would send Debbie running from the room, never to return. 'Wow... Debbie, I...' Billy trailed off, before running up to Debbie and throwing his arms round her. She leapt up off the bed to embrace him back. 'What are you doing here, Debbie?' said Billy. 'I've missed you' blurted out Debbie, before clapping her hands over her mouth. Billy grinned. 'I've missed you too. It's great to see you. You look so different.' Debbie just looked at the floor, trying to hide her scowl. It wasn't meant to happen like this. Debbie was meant to be in control now. Billy was supposed to throw himself at her feet and beg her to be with him. He was supposed to fawn over her new and improved looks, not make her blurt out dumb things and feel awkward and embarrassed and well, like the OLD Debbie. When Debbie finally looked back up at Billy, she saw that he was looking confused. She knew she had this one chance to turn things around. 'You never wrote' said Debbie half-smiling flirtatiously. 'Thought you might of forgotten me.' 'Nah' said Billy awkwardly. 'I would never. How's everyone? How are you?' This wasn't the reaction Debbie wanted. 'Fine. And how are you? How's the ballet going, dancing boy?' Debbie giggled playfully. Dancing boy... Billy stared at Debbie. 'Yeah, it's good. Um... Debbie... how's Michael?' Debbie gave up, feeling tears rush back to her eyes again. It was over. Clearly, Billy would never look on her as anything, just as she had suspected. Why had she listened to Michael? Hope was futile. Second chances? Don't exist. 'Ask Michael yourself' said Debbie, her voice cracking. She sank back down onto the bed. Billy's heart leapt as he turned around. Ask Michael yourself... that could only mean... 'Hi, Billy' Billy saw Michael. He stood shyly, by himself next to Billy's bed, a small smile on his red lips. His eyes were brighter than Billy remembered. His frame was thinner. Billy hugged Michael to him, never wanting to let go. Michael hugged Billy back and Billy could feel Michael gently shaking, and felt Michael's warm tears on his shoulder. Even now, Billy was taller and stronger than Michael and perhaps it was this that made Billy want to protect the other boy with his life. To pull him out of harm's way and never leave him again. But Billy knew this was impossible. When Billy started to feel Charlie and Debbie's eyes boring into his back, he reluctantly let Michael go. 'Come on. I'll give you a tour.' said Billy, quietly, needing time alone with Michael. Michael headed wordlessly to the door. Debbie stood up to follow. 'After you, Michael. ' said Billy, meaningfully. Charlie pulled Debbie back down next to him. It wasn't necessary. Debbie had already taken the hint. Billy knew he would hurt her feelings, but he couldn't be bothered with that now. Michael was here. That was all that mattered. The two boys walked silently to the ballet studio. Michael watched as Billy's toned, athletic body loped ahead of him, his graceful stride far longer than Michael's own. Billy took in Michael's thin face, wanting to etch the memory onto his mind, never to be forgotten again. The ballet studio was large and echoing. Mirrors and bars lined the walls and an eery silence greeted the boys as they crossed the wooden floors. A beautiful mosaic gleamed on the ceiling, but Michael had eyes for nothing but Billy. His old denim was gone, replaced by loose fitting gear with the schools logo on it. But, Billy was still the same Billy. His eyes a warm blue. His hair the colour of honey. His frame muscly and tanned. His smile bright and sunny. His whole being pulling Michael in. 'Billy... I've missed you. So much' 'I've missed you too, Michael.' And Michael believed him.[Chapter 5] Billy smiled at Michael, not knowing exactly how to fit 4 long years of longing, sadness, love and suppressed emotions into words. But he knew he had to try. 'Um, Michael. I just want to say... I'm sorry. Sorry for not writing to you. I should have. Even just as a best mate, not necessarily as a...' Billy stopped, seeing Michael flinch at the words 'just as a best mate' and wanted to kick himself. He couldn't believe he was making such a muck up of something so important. 'Oh God, I'm so bad at this...' Billy stammered. Michael shook his head. 'Me too, Billy. I don't know how to explain... Well, I guess things are different now. Maybe there's no need to explain.' Billy stared at Michael, feeling his limbs start to tremble, the way they always did when he really scared or nervous. Michael saw this, and he knew what the trembling meant. Michael knew most things about Billy. 'I'm sorry things have been this way, Billy. I don't mean to make you feel awkward or nervous round me, I just... I came to say I miss you. I miss... my best mate.' Michael swallowed down his feelings and gave Billy a slight smile. Billy felt himself start to shake. He couldn't bear the formality between them. This wasn't the way he'd imagined things. Why was he such a coward? He knew why. He just wished he could explain it to Michael. In seconds, the gap between the two slender boys was gone, as Billy pressed himself to Michael and lightly touched his lips to the smaller boy's. The tender kiss seemed more like a question than anything else, a warning. Something to say 'is this okay with you?'. Michael caressed Billy's face with his smooth hands, and Billy had the answer. Their perfect, salty kisses lasted for several minutes before Billy finally pulled away and wiped Michael's eye to staunch the crystal tear that threatened to spill down his cheek. 'Come on.' whispered Billy. 'Where?' said Michael, sad that the beautiful kisses were over. 'Out. I want to take you around, show you London. I love exploring it and I've been wanting to do it with you for ages' 'Really?' 'Yeah' 'Okay, then, let's go' But their romantic evening was spoiled when Charlie arrived at the front entrance next to them, announcing that he'd had the same idea. 'It didn't seem fair that Debbie should come all the way here not to see the city. So I offered to take her round' Charlie said cheerfully. Billy and Michael reluctantly agreed and Billy hurried off to find spare gloves and hats for Michael and Debbie, to fend off the chill of the the cold London nights. Debbie and Michael were left staring at Charlie, who's bright smile suggested that he was oblivious to any awkwardness. Within a minute, three girls had wandered up to Charlie, claiming that they were 'ready to go'. 'Forgot to say,' smiled Charlie apologetically. 'I invited them to come too.' Michael mumbled something inaudible, seeing his perfect night with Billy rapidly fading into the distance. The first girl, a tall, slim, ringlet-haired blonde, flung her arm around Charlie. 'Hiya!' she squealed, with a grin as bright as a 1000 watt bulb. 'I'm Violet. Charlie's sister' Michael frowned as he heard something like a sigh of relief from Debbie, but couldn't give it much thought because Violet was already introducing the second girl. 'This is Sara,' said Violet squeezing the other girls hand. Sara was incredibly skinny, more so than Debbie even, and had a pale, gaunt face. Her mousey brown hair flowed freely to her shoulders and she shrank into herself as she smiled shyly at Michael, as if she was uncomfortable in her own skin. The last girl was different. She slunk into the tight knit group as if she owned the room, her thick, glossy, jet black mane fluttering down her back. Her face was creamy white and her big blue eyes pierced everything she looked at. Debbie couldn't help admiring her perfect round lips and equally circular curves. Her nose had a perfect upturn to it, unlike Debbie's, which she had always hated because of the clumsy, unnecessary bump in the middle. Despite the fact that this girl was the shortest person Michael had ever seen, she also seemed to radiate the most power. And when she opened her perfect little mouth, narrowed her perfect little eyes and spoke with her perfect little voice, the words she said sent a dagger through Michael's heart. 'Hi. I'm Willow.' Her pink lips curved into a smile. 'I'm Billy's girlfriend.'[Chapter 6] It was an hour into the worst evening of Michael's life and he was desperate to leave. He was in the most glamourous place he'd ever been, with the person he'd been dying to see for four years and yet he would rather be anywhere else. He glanced over at Debbie, who looked equally miserable. Coming to see Billy had been a terrible idea after all. After the beautiful kisses they'd shared in the dance studio, Michael had allowed himself to dream of what could be. But now he realised it had been futile. He was only kidding himself. The group were in a smokey West End bar. The walls and floor were made of shiny black marble, flecked with silver. Bright spotlights darted round the room and everyone sat on bar stools or in booths with seats made out of zebra skin. The place was crowded with students from nearby colleges and universities, smart couples that had come straight from musicals and plays, and drunk young socialites fresh from the closest nightclub. No one, including the handsome bouncer at the door, had paid much attention to the group of teenagers sat in the booth farthest from the door. Willow was draped over an uncomfortable-looking Billy, ignoring the flirtatious glances she was given from every man that passed her. Debbie was wedged awkwardly between Charlie and his sister Violet, trying hard to make conversation and simultaneously ignore Billy. Michael sat next to a silent Sara, who was constantly looking at him, drawing breath as if about to speak and then shutting her mouth again. A good-looking young boy, about 17 or 18 years old approached the table, grinning at Willow. Willow turned away and ran her fingers through Billy's thick mane of hair. The boy's smile dimmed, but he turned to Violet and said, 'Do you want a drink?' Charlie stiffened, and Debbie couldn't help smiling at his sweet, overprotective-brother attitude. 'Sure' said Violet, flashing her luminous smile. Charlie opened his mouth to protest, but Violet just winked at him and left with the boy. 'So,' purred Willow. 'How long are you two planning to stay?' 'Not long' blurted out Michael. Billy looked up, his expression unreadable. It was sort of a cross between hurt and apologetic. Michael could have bitten his tongue off. 'I mean, we wanna stay for a while, but I dunno when we're expected home and stuff, so...' Michael trailed off. Willow was still looking at him, waiting for him to finish, but they way she had snuggled up to Billy and pulled his arm over her, rendered him Michael unable to speak. Billy drew back his arm and hastily sipped at his drink. Debbie could feel her eyes filling with tears. What is wrong with me? Any one of my mates would kill for a night out in London. And here I am, about to start blubbing! She swallowed the tears down and forced herself to look up at Charlie. 'How long have you been at the school then?' She said. Charlie jumped, surprised at her question, but mouth settled into a smile. 'Just over 5 years. I've always loved dancing though.' 'And you never got teased or anything?' 'Not really. Though I guess I didn't tell my old mates about it enough for them to tease me.' 'And your parents were okay with it?' 'Course.' 'They didn't think you was gay?' Charlie looked confused. 'No. I mean, I understand why they would, a lot of the boys at the school are. But I told them I wasn't and they believed me. I guess it helped that Violet understood the appeal of ballet, and she could help explain it to them' Debbie glanced over at Billy, who was gradually turning bright pink as Willow whispered into his ear. She turned back to Charlie, but his attention wasn't on her anymore. He was staring at something behind her. Debbie turned to see what it was. It was Violet, her blonde curls flying around her head as she danced with the boy who'd bought her a drink. She looked so happy that Debbie almost felt tearful again. I've never looked that happy , she thought. She looked at Charlie hands, which were clenching into fists as he watched the boy wrap his arms around his sister's waist. He looked furious. Debbie could feel herself smiling. She placed one small, slender hand on his wrist. Charlie jumped again and stared at her. His face seemed to change. Suddenly, he leant over and whispered in her ear, 'Go in there,' he nodded to a door across the room. 'I'll be there in 10 minutes'. Debbie got up and walked through the door, heart pounding. Maybe this evening won't be such a disaster after all. 'Where's she going?' said Billy, leaning forward, away from Willow. 'Bathroom' shrugged Charlie. 'Looks like Violet's having fun' smirked Willow, gesturing to the dance floor. 'I guess' 'You're not going all protective big brother on her again are you, Charlie? You're 10 minutes older than she is' 'So?' Willow rolled her eyes and leant back in the chair. 'How are you, Sara? Haven't seen you in a while' said Billy, desperately. 'Fine' Sara murmured. It was the first time Michael had heard her speak. Silence, for another few minutes. 'Well, this is an eventful evening if I ever saw one' snickered Willow. Billy wanted to sink into the floor. 'Do you want to dance, Billy?' 'I'm fine, thanks' 'What's wrong? I thought that's what they all you. At least, that's what Devi calls you, isn't it? Dancing boy?' 'It's Debbie' 'What?' 'You said Devi. Her name's Debbie' Willow gave a snort, then stood up. 'Well I'm going to have fun, even if you're not. Coming Charlie?' 'Nah' Charlie shook his head, glancing over at the door into which Debbie had disappeared. Willow shook her head and walked away. Debbie lean against a pink, fur wall, in a long corridor. It was lit only only by candles and it smelled like sweat and roses. The corridor was lined with red velvet curtains, most of them drawn, and behind the curtains came the sounds of lots of couples... having fun. Debbie felt her cheeks get hot. She was a virgin and she'd only met Charlie a few hours ago. What on Earth did he expect from her? The door she'd come through burst open. Debbie spun towards it, expecting to see Charlie. Instead, there, in all her beauty, stood Willow. Willow strode up to Debbie, her mesmerising eyes on fire. 'Stay away from Billy. I don't who you are, or what you want with him, but you aren't going to get it. Billy deserves the best and you...' Willow looked Debbie up and down. 'Well, you will never be the best.' Willow started to leave, but Debbie spoke up, 'Why do you need to tell me that?' Willow stopped. 'What did you say?' 'I mean, if I'll never be good enough for Billy, then why even bother telling me? There's no need to. I'll just never get him, if I'm not good enough. You don't have to tell me.' 'You're a freak' said Willow, rolling her eyes and walking away. 'The only reason you're trying to intimidate me is because you feel threatened' Debbie carried on, even though her knees felt like they were about to melt. Willow whirled round. 'Threatened? By you ?' she cackled. 'Don't kid yourself' If you didn't think I was capable of stealing Billy away from you, you wouldn't try and force me not to' Willow face turned to stone and she spat at Debbie's feet. Then she left without another word.[Chapter 7]  ","Summary":" Authors Note: This short story is about what happened after Billy left and went to the Royal Ballet"},{"Movie":"Space Jam","Title":"Monstars: Nawt's Sugar Rush","Author":"DragonBallZJam3000","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12843952","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: On a nice,dark evening, the four Monstars Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt were in the living room watching TV while Bang was baking fresh chocolate chip cookies in the dining room. Bang was wearing a chef hat and a black apron that says \"Kiss the Cook\" with flames on the the oven went off, Bang took the tray of cookies out of the oven while wearing oven mitts and placed the tray on the dining room. The sweet aroma spreads through the kitchen to the living room and flowed straight into the four boys' noses. Pound,Bupkus, Blanko, and Nawt smelled the sweet chocolatey aroma from kitchen as they closed their eyes and smiled with delight. When they opened their eyes again, they were mesmerized by the smell. \"Man, did you guys smell that?\" Pound asked the others. Blanko replied, \"We sure did dude. Bang made chocolate chip cookies.\" \"Yeah, and they smell good too.\" Bupkus added. \"They sure do you guys.\" Nawt got off the couch and told the others,\"Well what are we still doing here for? Let's get some cookies.\" The three smiled and replied, \"Yeah!\" Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt also got off the couch and the four Monstars went to the kitchen to get some chocolate chip cookies Bang made. When the four Monstars made it to the kitchen, Bang noticed them and said, \"Sup guys? Are you some of my delicious,fresh chocolate chip cookies?\" Pound replied, \"We sure are Bang. You must've put a lot of effort into baking these cookies.\" Bang smiled at Pound's compliment, \"Thanks Pound. I appreciate the compliment.\" The two them gave each other a fist bump. \"Well guys, let's get some napkins and eat some cookies.\" Bang said taking off his chef hat and apron. After the Monstars brought some napkins from the counter next to their sink, they each grabbed three cookies from tray and wrapped them around with their napkins. Pound and the gang took a bite of their cookies and were satisfied by the taste. \"Man Bang, these are the best cookies I've ever tasted.\" Pound said with a smile. \"Yeah cookies are fly!\" Blanko agreed. \"Super fly!\" Bupkus added. \"Thanks you guys. I'm really glad all of you love my cooking.\"Bang smiled. Then suddenly,Nawt belches out loud after eating his cookies in a nick of time and makes the rest of the boys jump. \"Nawt!\" The four of them shouted. \"Whoops. Excuse me.\" Nawt said while showing an embarrassing smile. Nawt was filled with wonder and joy after eating those Bang made. \"Man those cookies were so good! I must have more!\" He exclaimed. Right before Nawt reached for the cookies on the tray, Bang slapped his right hand which caused him to yell in pain. \"Ow! What the heck was that for Bang?!\" \"Nawt, there is no way I'm letting you eat all of these cookies that I baked!\" Bang growled at him. \"Bang's right. He didn't bake those cookies just for you. He baked the cookies for all of us.\" Pound told Nawt. Nawt rolled his eyes and asked, \"Oh come on you guys. What's the harm of having a few more cookies? \"It's just that people sometimes regret after eating too much sweets,especially cookies.\" Blanko reasoned with him. \"I agree with Blanko. That's all we're saying.\"said Bupkus. Nawt sighed as he realized he couldn't argue with his friends for trying to not to eat too much cookies. \"You guys are right.I promise not to eat too much cookies.\" \"Good.\" Pound said, \"Now come on you guys, let's head back to the living room and watch some TV.\" When Pound,Bupkus,.and Blanko went back into the living room, Bang turned around and gave Nawt a warning. \"Listen Nawt.\" he snarled, \"If you eat all of my cookies so help me I will beat the red off of you. Do I make myself clear?\" Nawt gulped in fear as he answered, \"Cr-crystal clear Bang.\" When Bang left the kitchen to the living room with the rest of the Monstars, Nawt followed him as his heart started throbbing really fast after hearing Bang's warning.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The next afternoon, the Monstars were in the gym playing basketball and exercising Pound and Bang were playing a little one-on-one, Blanko was doing push-ups, Bupkus was lifting weights, and Nawt was doing sit ups. After doing thirty sit ups, Nawt sat down on the bleachers to take a brake and drink his bottle of water. While sitting on the bleachers, Nawt couldn't stop thinking about how good Bang's chocolate chip cookies were last night. Thinking about them made him lick his lips and his stomach growling. \"Man, those cookies Bang made last night were so good, I have to have more of them.\" he thought, \"But then again, I don't want to break my promise to my friends.\" Nawt right eye started to quiver, his teeth chattered, and his body began to shake. Nawt knew he couldn't take it anymore and wanted to eat more of Bang's cookies. Suddenly, Nawt had an idea, \"That's it!\" he thought to himself, \"I'll just tell the others that I super hungry and we'll head back home for lunch so I can eat more of those yummy chocolate chip cookies. And besides, it's only 12:00.\" Nawt got off the bleachers and put his plan into action. He walked up to the four Monstars while they were taking a break and said, \"Hey guys, are you all hungry? I'm a little peckish.\" Pound replied, \"Yeah Nawt. To be honest I'm a little hungry too. Bang agreed, \"Yeah me too.\" \"Me three man, playing basketball and exercising sure does work up an appetite.\" Blanko said rubbing his stomach. Pound looked at Bupkus and asked him if he was hungry too, \"What about you Bupkus? Are you hungry too?\" He replied, \"Not really.\" But when everyone including Bupkus heard his stomach growling, the rest of the Monstars stared at him; causing him blush and chuckle. \"Heh heh, maybe I am a little hungry too.\" Bupkus said as he gave out an embarrassing smile. Nawt had a smile on his face when he knew that things were all going according to his plan. \"This is great Nawt. Now all you gotta do is tell them you would like to head back to the mansion for lunch and you're good to go.\"he thought. Right before Nawt was about to say something, Bupkus suggested that they should go somewhere else for lunch. \"Hey I know! Let's head to Burger Barn to get some cheeseburgers, fries, and some shakes for lunch. The rest of the Monstars loved his suggestion, except for Nawt. His jaw dropped in shock when he realized his plan didn't work out too good, so he shook his head and went with Bupkus' suggestion. \"Yeah, that's a great idea.\" he said. \"Then it's settled. Let's head to Burger Barn to eat some burgers.\" Pound told them. When the five Monstars left the gym, Nawt face palmed and thought, \"Darn it! So close!\" Pound locked the door up shut, and the boys went into their car to drive to Burger Barn for lunch.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Meanwhile at Burger Barn, the Monstars were eating some delicious cheeseburgers with a side of fries and milkshakes. While Pound was eating his burger he was satisfied by the taste. \"This is the best burger I've ever eaten.\" Pound said. \"You can say that again.\"Bupkus agreed. Everyone was enjoying their meal. Even though Nawt's plan didn't work out, he tried to look on the bright side of life. \"Oh well, at least it wasn't a total lost. You got something to eat for lunch.\" Nawt thought to himself as he took a bite off of his cheeseburger and fries. While the guys were eating, they were talking about what they should do when they get back home. \"So what do you guys wanna do next?\" Pound asked the others. Nawt ears perked up when he had another idea to eat more of Bang's cookies. \"I have an idea.\" he said, \"Why don't we head back home and watch some Basketball?\" The other Monstars thought about Nawt's suggestion and liked the idea. \"That's not a bad idea Nawt. We can watch Women's Basketball!\" said Bupkus. \"Nice idea Bupkus! I love Women's Basketball.\" Pound said with delight. \"Me too guys.\" Blanko agreed, \"There's nothing better than watching a bunch of hot and strong girls playing basketball like we do.\" \"Yeah.\" The rest of Monstars said dreamly. \"Then it's settled.\" Pound told the others, \"After we finish our food, let's head back home and watch some Women's Wrestling on TV.\" When the boys finished eating, they left Burger Barn and went back into their car to head back to their mansion. On their way back home, Nawt had a big smile on his face when he knew that his plan worked. \"Yes! My plan is working!\" he thought, \"Once we head back home and wait for the right moment, it'll be cookie time!\" Finally, the Monstars made it back home and Pound drove the car inside the garage when he opened the door with the garage door opener. When the boys got out the car, Pound closed the garage door and they all went inside their mansion.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Meanwhile in the living room, the five Monstars were on the couch watching women's basketball on their HD TV in their living room. The five of them were enjoying their show. \"Man, watching women play basketball is a awesome idea.\" said Bang. \"It sure is man, nice thinking Bupkus.\" said Blanko. \"Thanks you guys,\" Bupkus said smiling, \"Isn't it great seeing beautiful young girls playing the same sport as we do?\" \"It sure is.\" they all agreed. While they were still watching their favorite show, Nawt had a sly idea.\"This is a great!\" Nawt thought cunningly, \"Now that the others are distracted by our favorite show, this is my chance to go to the kitchen and get those cookies!\" Nawt slid off the couch slowly and tiptoed to the kitchen. Before he got there, Pound,Bupkus,Bang and Blanko turned around and noticed Nawt was heading towards the kitchen. Pound asked, \"Nawt where do you think you're going?\" Nawt jumped and turned around to face Pound and the others and tried to be calm. \"Nothing, I was just about to head to the kitchen to get a snack.\" The others felt suspicious about what Nawt was up to. Bupkus raised his eyebrow and asked,\"Nawt, you're not thinking of eating all of those cookies Bang made are you?\" Nawt gulped nervously and replied, \"No, not at all. I just want two cookies, that's all.\" \"Fine, you get two cookies and that's it.\" Bang told him. Nawt smiled with glee and zoomed into the kitchen. After Nawt grabbed a napkin, he opened the cookie jar, grabbed two cookies with his napkin, and closed the jar as he went back to the living room. Nawt sat back on the couch with his best friends and starting eating his cookies. When Nawt finished eating them he shivered by the taste and asked Bang if he could have another. \"Hey Bang, can I have another cookie?\" \"Seriously Nawt?\" Bang said glaring at Nawt,\"You just ate two cookies and now you want another one?\" Nawt replied, \"Yeah. So can I have another cookie?\" \"No!\" Bang said sternly, \"We're not going to let you eat more of my cookies.\" \"Bang's right.\" Pound agreed, \"You had enough.\" Nawt whined, \"Why are you guys doing this to me? I just want one more cookie.\" Bupkus reasoned with Nawt, \"We're doing this because we're your friends. Also, you should lay off the cookies for a while.\" \"But why? Nawt asked,\"Bang's cookies are so chocolaty and delicious.\" \"You see Nawt when people eat too much sweats like cookies, they enter in a sugar rush and later become worn out and tired.\" Blanko told Nawt. \"Blanko is right Nawt, that's all we're saying.\" said Pound. \"Ok, I understand.\" Nawt sighed. \"Good. Now c'mon you guys,it's burrito night. Let's head to the kitchen to eat some burritos.\" Bang said. The five Monstars like the idea, so they got off the couch and went to the kitchen for some burritos. When they got there, Nawt asked, \"Can I still have one more cookie after I finish my burrito?\" The rest of the Monstars glared at Nawt and shouted, \"NO!\" Nawt gulped and smiled nervously. \"Never mind.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: In the kitchen, the Monstars made some burritos for dinner. After they finished making them, the boys went back to the living room to watch their favorite show. They sat back down on the couch and ate their delicious burritos. Even though Nawt was enjoying his burrito, he still couldn't stop thinking about Bang's cookies and realized that his plan wasn't working. \"Dang it Nawt!\" he thought to himself, \"Pull yourself together! You gotta get those cookies!\" But Nawt also remembered what Bupkus and the others said about eating too much cookies. \"No I can't do it! My friends are only doing what's best for me!\" Nawt couldn't make up mind and his right eye was twitching. He shook his head and snapped out of it. \"The others are right.\" Nawt thought, \"I don't need to eat all of those cookies. At least I got a burrito to eat.\" The red Monstar continued to eat his burrito and watch Women's Basketball on TV with his friends. Five hours later after dinner, the Monstars got into their pajamas in their rooms and went straight to bed. The Monstars were sleeping peacefully in their rooms, until Nawt woke up in the middle of the night when he realized he couldn't sleep. He still kept thinking about Bang's chocolate chip cookies. \"That's it! I can't take it anymore!\" he thought anxiously, \"I have to get more of those cookies!\" Nawt did some thinking and had another sneaky idea. \"That's it!\" Nawt thought eagerly,\"I'll just sneak into the kitchen, get two cookies to eat from the cookie jar and head back to bed. What could possibly go wrong?\" Nawt got out of his bed while wearing his light red footie pajamas and snuck out of his room to head to the kitchen downstairs for some cookies. When he got to the kitchen, he opened the cookie jar next to the microwave and grabbed two cookies. The pupils in Nawt's eyes started spinning and he started to drool a little bit. He whispered to himself, \"At long last! My precious cookies!\" The little red Monstar tossed the two cookies and went straight into his mouth. After he chewed the cookies, he swallowed them and started shivering with joy and delight. \"Sooo good.\" he left the kitchen and went back upstairs. Before he went into his room, he heard Pound voice, \"Stop right there Nawt!\" he said, Nawt was startled when he heard Pound's voice. The little red alien kept his cool and turned around seeing Pound wearing his light blue pajamas and a nightcap with a suspicious look on his face. \"Hey Pound. What's up?\" he said casually, \"What were you doing in the kitchen at 2:00 in the morning?\" Pound asked Nawt. Nawt gulped and started to sweat a little as he came up with a lie to fool Pound, \"Uh, I went to the kitchen to drink some water.\" Pound raised his eyebrow, \"Really?\" Nawt nodded his head and replied, \"Yeah really.\" \"Just go back to bed Nawt.\" Pound told him. The two Monstars went back to their rooms and headed straight for bed. When Nawt went back into his room he wiped off the sweat from his forehead and sighed with relief.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The next afternoon after lunch,the Monstars were about to head to the park to play some basketball. \"Alright boys!\" said Pound, \"Let's head to the park and play some basketball!\" \"Yeah!\" The Monstars cheered as they left the mansion. Pound closed the front door shut and the five aliens walked to the park. While the boys were on their way to the park, Nawt had another sneaky plan. \"Okay Nawt. Keep it together\" he thought to himself, \"You're new plan won't get sabotaged this time.\" Nawt came up with a new plan to eat more of Bang's cookies in his head. \"First, I'll play basketball with my friends for a couple of minutes. Then, I'll tell the others that I have to go to the bathroom. Finally when I get back home, I'll sneak into the kitchen and eat more cookies.\" Nawt had a sneaky smile on his face as he chuckled cunningly. When the five Monstars made it to the park, they head to the basketball court to shoot some hoops for a couple of hours. As time went by, the boys sat on the bench in the court and took a break. Pound was drinking his bottle of water, Bang was eating an energy bar, Blanko was playing a video game on his cell phone, Bupkus was wiping sweat off of his face with a washcloth while he had his jersey off, and Nawt was twiddling his fingers as he tries to tell his friends that he has to go back home to use the bathroom. \"Hey Pound.\" Nawt said, \"I have to use the bathroom back in the mansion.\" \"Why didn't you go before we left?\" Pound asked him. \"And why don't you use the restrooms here in the park?\" Nawt started sweating, and shifted his eyes back and forward when Pound asked him those questions. The little red Monstar replied, \"Because I didn't feel like need to go until now and I like the scenery of our bathroom.\" Pound,Bupkus,Bang, and Blanko looked at each other and gave Nawt a suspicious look on their faces;knowing that their little red friend was up to something. So Pound came up with an idea to find out what Nawt is planning. \"I have a better idea.\" Pound said, \"Let's head back home anyway.\" Nawt grew nervous when his plan wasn't working for the third time. He stammered, \"A-Are you sure that's necessary?\" Pound replied, \"Oh it's necessary alright. It's better than coming back all the way here from the mansion just to use the bathroom right guys?\" Pound turns to Bupkus,Blanko, and Bang and gave them a wink and a smile. Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang knew it was part of Pound's plan to find out what Nawt was up to. So, they agreed with him. \"Right!\" The three of them said as they winked and smiled back at him. After Bupkus puts his jersey back on, he said, \"I agree with Pound. We are getting tired anyway.\" \"Yeah.\" said the four Monstars. \"C'mon you guys.\" Pound told the others, \"Let's head back home for a nap.\" Pound and the others smiled and winked at each other and the five Monstars left the park and headed back home. On the way back home, Nawt still couldn't believe that his new plan didn't work. \"This is impossible!\" he thought hopelessly, \"No matter how I try to get more of Bang's cookies, the others tried to stop me.\" Nawt felt like giving up, but then he had another cunning idea. \"What a minute! Nawt thought to himself, \"If Pound and the others are tired, that means they'll take a nap when we get back home and I can eat more of those cookies!\" Nawt smiled with joy when he realized his plan was working after all. But little did he know that Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang were planning something to stop Nawt from eating all of the cookies back in their mansion.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: When the Monstars got back inside the mansion, Pound closed and locks the front door shut. \"Well guys, we're back home.\" Pound said. \"Since we're back inside the mansion, I bet you guys are tired right now.\" said Nawt. \"We sure are little dude.\" Blanko smiled as he replied, \"We're so tired, we could nap for hours.\" \"Blanko is right.\" Bupkus agreed, \"I'm so tired, I could sleep like a log.\" Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang pretended to yawn to fool Nawt so they can stop him from eating too much cookies. Nawt smiled as he thought to himself, \"Finally Nawt! This is your chance!\" \"That's alright.\" said Nawt, \"You guys get your rest while I go to the bathroom.\" And so, Nawt walked slowly next to the bathroom door while Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang were pretending to walk upstairs by walking in place on the stairs. Suddenly, the saw their little red friend zoom into the kitchen. Pound whispered to the others, \"C'mon you guys. Let's see what our little buddy Nawt is up to in the kitchen.\" \"You got it.\" The rest of them whispered. The four Monstars tiptoed from downstairs and snuck next to the kitchen entrance. The four boys poked their heads in the kitchen and saw Nawt opening the cookie jar next to the microwave. Nawt smiled with joy when his plan finally worked. \"I did it! He said with glee, \"I finally get to eat more of these cookies!\" Nawt started eating the cookies straight from the jar and felt giddy inside.\" Suddenly, Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang jumped into the kitchen and caught Nawt red handed as they shouted, \"Aha! Busted!\" which caused Nawt to jump in fear. He turned around with a nervous look on his face while Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang were furious with him. Nawt gulped when he asked the others a question.\"Guys? How did you all know that I was eating more cookies? I thought you guys were about to take a nap.\" Bupkus replied, \"We knew you were up to something, so we came up with a plan to stop you.\" \" did we tell you about eating too much of Bang's cookies?!\" Pound asked sternly.\"Pound's right Nawt.\" Bupkus agreed, \"Eating too much of Bang's cookies can give you cavities and make you feel sick. You know that right?\" \"I know.\" Nawt replied, \"But I can't help myself. Bang's cookies are so good!\" Pound said, \"That's still no excuse to hog them all for yourself.\" \"I agree with Pound, dude.\" Blanko reasoned with Nawt, \"You shouldn't eat too much sugar; it's not good for you.\" Bang was also furious at Nawt for trying to eat all of his cookies for himself. \"You should be ashamed of yourself Nawt!\" he growled, \"I told you that I didn't bake those cookies just for you. I baked those for all of us.\" \"I'm sorry Bang.\" Nawt apologized, \"But I can't help myself.\" Bang was fed up with Nawt's excuses and couldn't take it anymore.\" I don't want to hear any more of your excuses!\" he shouted, \"You better save us some cookies! If you don't,I'm gonna make you bake them without my help and without my recipes!\" Nawt shook nervously when heard Bang's threats. \"But I don't know how to bake cookies!\" Nawt exclaimed, \"I don't even know how to cook!\" \"You'll learn how to cook if you keep eating those cookies!\" Bang yelled. Bupkus restrains Bang, \"Bang, don't you think you're being a little harsh on Nawt?\" Bupkus reasoned with him. \"You have to calm down\".\" Bang took a deep breath and finally calmed down. However, the rest of the boys were still upset with Nawt. \"We're really disappointed in you Nawt.\" said Pound. \"Yeah, man.\" Blanko said, \"That was a very selfish thing to do. Pound,Blanko, and Bang left the kitchen. Before Bupkus left, he told Nawt, \"Before you start eating those cookies, ask yourself; what's more important? Cookies or your friends?\" After Bupkus left, Nawt was filled shame inside. \"What have I done?\" he asked himself.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Later at dawn, Nawt felt shameful about trying to eat more of Bang's cookies for himself, which made his friends disappointed in him. \"Man. How can I be so selfish?\" Nawt thought shamefully, \"I can believe I let those cookies get in the way of my friendship with the others.\" Nawt was full of regret about what he did. \"The others were right.\" Nawt thought, \"I've should've listen to them about eating too much cookies.\" Suddenly, Nawt heard Pound call his name from the living room.\"Nawt! We need to talk to you.\" Nawt knew he had to stay strong and accept any punishment they have for him. Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang looked at their little red friend with displeasure as Nawt walked into the living room. The four Monstars scoffed, \"Well,well, it isn't Nawt the Cookie Eater.\" \"Hey guys. Is there something you guys want to tell me?\" Nawt asked. Pound said,\"Bupkus,Blanko,Bang, and I are going to the gym to do some exercise.\" \"And I'm coming too, right?\" Nawt asked with an nervous smile, Bang growled,\"Oh no you're not! We have a special punishment for you.\" Nawt gulped and started shaking in fear. \"What is it?\" he asked nervously. \"While we're gone, you are going to clean the entire mansion from top to bottom when we get back. \"What?! But that'll take all night!\" Nawt exclaimed.\"I don't want to hear it!\" Pound shouted, \"You chose to eat most of Bang's cookies for yourself, so this is your punishment!\" Bang growled, \"That's what you get for trying to eat all of my cookies for yourself!\" \"This is for your own good Nawt.\"Bupkus said. Blanko scolded, \"We tried to warn you Nawt, but you didn't listen.\" \"C'mon you guys.\" Pound told the others, \"Nawt has a lot of cleaning to do.\" When Pound opens the front door, he and the others glared at Nawt as they leave. After the door closes, Nawt felt more ashamed of himself when he knew how upset his friends were when they caught Nawt eating most of Bang's cookies. \"I blew it!\" he blamed on himself, \"I'm stuck here all because I wanted Bang's cookies all to myself and it's all my fault!\" Nawt was filled was extreme guilt and sadness. \"My friends were right.\" Nawt said, \"I should've listened to them about eating too much cookies.\" Nawt knew it was time to take responsibility for actions clean the entire mansion, and apologize to friends about what he had done. \"I gotta apologize to the others.\" Nawt said to himself, \"But first, it's time to get cleaning.\"[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: After 3 hours of cleaning the entire mansion,Nawt was exhausted and went to his room. \"I did it.\" He said to himself, \"I finished cleaning the entire mansion including my room from top to bottom.\" Nawt felt super tired and decided that it was time for a nap. He yawned, \"Man, after cleaning the mansion, I deserve a break.\" After Nawt takes off his sneakers. he gets into his bed and closes his eyes shut. In his dream, Nawt starts having a nightmare about him screaming as he falls down in a spinning spiral background with cookies flying around. Suddenly, he starts hearing Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang's voice and stopped screaming. \"NAWT! NAWT!\" \"Guys?\" asked Nawt, \"Where are you guys?\" \"We're right here dude.\" Blanko replied. The four Monstars appeared around him like ghosts which caused the little red alien to scream in fear. Nawt exclaimed\"Guys?! What happened to your bodies?!\" \"That's not important!\" Pound said sternly, \"Why didn't you listen to us about eating too much cookies?\" Nawt explained, \"I'm sorry you guys! But I couldn't control myself; Bang's cookies were so good!\" Bupkus scoffed at Nawt, \"What are you talking about Nawt? You can control yourself when you eat his cookies! You're just making excuses.\" Bang agreed with Bupkus and said, \"Bupkus is right! I was the one who made for all of us, not just for you!\" Blanko scoffed, \"This is what you get for eating too much cookies dude.\" Nawt apologized to his four ghostly friends for what he has done, \"I'm sorry you guys. I just wanted to eat more of Bang's cookies!\" Bang growled, \"You want more cookies? We'll give you more cookies!\" Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang snapped their fingers together from their right hands and made Nawt disappear. The little red alien reappeared back in the kitchen and fell flat on his face like a pancake. When he got up, he realized the kitchen was humongous and he was shorter than his normal size. \"What happened to the kitchen?!\" Nawt exclaimed, \"And what happened to me? I know I'm short, but this is ridiculous.\" Suddenly, Nawt saw the cookie jar moving; which caused him to sweat and shake in fear as it kept shaking until something in the jar moved the lid off from the inside. Nawt gulped when he knew something bad was about to happen to him. But then, Nawt saw something absolutely horrific. A bunch of man-eating cookies jumped out the cookie jar and landed on the kitchen floor glaring at Nawt as he shook in terror. \"Get him boys!\" The cookie leader with an eye patch shouted, \"That's the red troublemaker who ate most of our friends!\"Nawt screamed with fear as he ran away from the man-eating cookies that were trying to eat him. He ran into the living room until he finally made it to the front , Nawt was too small to open the door and tried to jump up and down to get to the doorknob, but remained unsuccessful. Nawt turned around and looked at the army of man eating cookies heading towards him with fear. Nawt was surrounded and knew that there was no way out. \"It's hopeless! There's no way out here!\" Nawt exclaimed. He started to feel extremely guilty as the cookie army went closer to him. \"My friends were right!\" he said to himself, \"I SHOULD'VE LISTENED!\" Finally, the nightmare ended.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Meanwhile back in Nawt's bedroom, Pound,Bupkus,Blanko, and Bang were trying to wake up Nawt as they shake him while he was talking in his sleep.\"I should've listened! I should've listened!\" Pound shouted, \"Wake up Nawt!\" \"C'mon Nawt, you gotta get up man!\" Blanko told him. \"Nawt, you have to wake up!\" said Bang. \"Nawt! You have to get up!\" said Bupkus. Finally, the four Monstars paused for a moment when they saw their little red friend wake up from a terrible dream. Nawt rubbed his right eye with his right hand and moaned, \"Man, What happened?\" Bupkus responded, \"You were having a nightmare Nawt.\" Blanko said, \"Yeah little dude. It sounded liked you had one heck of a dream.\" Nawt remembered what he did before he took a nap. \"That's it!\" he exclaimed, \"I took a nap after I finished cleaning the entire house!\" Bang scoffed, \"Looks like all the sugar from my cookies you consumed really put you to sleep. You're lucky that I wasn't the one to put you to sleep.\" Nawt chuckled nervously as he rubs his head and said, \"Yeah, lucky me.\" The rest of the boys look at Nawt with displeasure. \"We're still upset at you for what you did.\" Pound scoffed. Nawt saw how upset his friends were and decided to apologize for what he had done. \"You guys have every right to be upset with me, because my dream made me realize what I did was wrong and I want to apologize about my actions.\" Pound and the others looked at each other and looked back at Nawt. They could tell that he was deeply sorry about what he had done. Nawt continues to apologize to the boys, \"I shouldn't have tried to eat all of Bang's cookies for myself. That's not who I am. I learned that what I did was selfish because I kept thinking about how good Bang's cookies were instead of thinking about my own friends. You guys are my best friends and all of you are more important to me than a bunch cookies.\" Finally, Nawt concluded his apology to his friends, \"So,what I'm trying to say is, I'm really really sorry.\" Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Bang accepted Nawt's apology after they knew how sorry he was. Pound walked over to Nawt and said, \"Alright Nawt, we forgive you.\" Nawt showed sad smile on his face until Pound continued, \"But on one condition, promise you'll never eat too much sugary snacks ever again.\" Nawt replied, \"I promise.\" Bang jumps into the conversation and says, \"Listen Nawt, I'm sorry for being too hard you about earlier.\" \"We all are.\" said Bupkus. Bang continues, \"But you gotta stop eating too much of my cookies. It's not good for your health and we're only saying that to save your life. Blanko says, \"Bang's right Nawt. Eating too much cookies could give you lots of cavities in your teeth and we don't want that to happen to you. Do understand what we're saying?\" Nawt understood and replied, \"I understand perfectly.\" Pound said, \"Good. Now that we got our apologies out of the way, what do you boys say we have some meatloaf for dinner?\" The rest of the Monstars liked Pound's suggestion and went downstairs to the kitchen so Bang can make dinner.[Chapter 11] Chapter: 11 Meanwhile in the Monstars' dining room, the boys were eating delicious meatloaf Bang made for dinner. After Nawt swallowed a piece of his meatloaf, he said, \"Man Bang, this meatloaf you made tastes great!\" Blanko said, \"I agree little dude.\" \"Nice and meaty\" said Bupkus. \"You're a true master chef, Bang.\" Pound complimented Bang. Bang smiled at his friends compliments about his cooking. \"Thanks you guys.\" While Nawt continued to eat his meatloaf, he said, \"You know guys, I learned a valuable lesson today.\" Bang asked, \"Oh really, what lesson have you learned?\" Nawt continued, \"I learned that eating sugary snacks are okay every once and awhile,but it's important to eat healthy and have a balanced diet.\"Pound said, \"That's good. We're really happy that you learned your lesson.\" Nawt smiled at his friends knowing that all is forgiven. He looked at Bang and said, \"Bang, I'm sorry again for trying to hog of your cookies for myself.\" Bang puts his hand on Nawt's shoulder and says, \"Nawt, it's remember the next time I bake some more cookies, try to control yourself and share some for us.\" Bupkus told Nawt, \"Bang's right Nawt. Always remember to stop and think before you do something you're not supposed to.\" \"Yes, I will.\" Nawt replied, \"Thanks for trying to stop me from eating too much sugar you guys.\" The four Monstars smiled at their little red friend and Blanko replied, \"It's our pleasure little dude.\" Pound said, \"Well boys, now that everything's back to normal. Let's continue to eat our meatloaf.\" \"Yeah.\" The four Monstars said while smiling. And for then on, Nawt never ate too much cookies ever again and everything was back to normal when Monstars continued to eat their meatloaf for dinner. The dream Nawt had made him realize that friendship was more important to him than cookies. THE END ","Summary":" Chapter 1: On a nice,dark evening, the four Monstars Pound,Bupkus,Blanko,and Nawt were in the livin"},{"Movie":"Space Jam","Title":"Quashing the clan: Sunrise's looney adventure","Author":"DimensionTraveler23","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12422937","Passage":"[Chapter 1] DimensionTraveler23 or Traveler here to tell you quite some things. First of all, my very first series, the Sierra Travelers Clan is finally coming to a end with the beloved leader's turn which is very fitting. As you have seen, Sunrise is going into 'Space Jam', and in my own mind here, the movies or shows of the Looney tunes beyond Sunrise's chosen world is no longer existing, for only the true original show will continue from 1994 or is it 1996 after the movie with Sunrise finishes, and no, Michael Jordan or any other human won't be there, because it's fanfiction! Only Portia will show up in some shots of this newest story, and no, she's not human, not in the way you think or maybe I think differently? Anyway, since she's the living embodiment of the dimension portal, she is technically made of magic, kinda like how Tinkerbell was made from pixie dust and a baby's first laugh. Neither way, please enjoy this story, viewers, and please review if you can. Good days to you all, my viewers. Ta. -Traveler. Hello, this is Sunrise. You can call me Chief, Dawn, whichever takes to you. Portia is typing this for me since Looneyland doesn't have computers and such. Looneyland, you ask? Oh, it's the world of the Looney Tunes behind the Warner Brothers portal. It's what I call my new home. Oh, I suppose I should start from the beginning, huh? It was one of those chilly yet sunny mornings, and wearing my totem necklace, as I was clothed in a purple tank top, then a long-sleeved blue shirt under a green jacket, with a red scarf, and black pants, with sunshine gold sneakers. I was heading to Leafpelt's old garage which was a fair distance from my townhouse. The townhouse resembles a Brownstone except bigger and wider. Like Metrostripe had said, I had returned the stolen money of Metrostripe's delirious ex-family, and I was surprised when I had received a humongous reward just for returning a long-lost mystery. So, I then changed almost every room in the townhouse, making them homes for injured or sick dogs from anywhere around Central Park, using the back door disguised as a dog door in the alley, knowing me as the true dog whisperer. I had entered Leafpelt's garage, and used the secret vent into the tunnel that leads from here into HQ. I heard there was a storm curling up around the city, so I wanted to avoid the surface, not wanting to be soaked from the incoming rain. I hummed a tune as I entered HQ from the only tunnel as the other tunnels has been closed up and good since I and Portia don't want anyone to discover HQ, we aren't ready to be invaded by newcomers or anything. I trust Portia as she is the only other human next to me, even if she is the living embodiment of the dimension portal. Portia greeted me, \"Hey, Sunrise. About time you got here, the Nerdlucks just had changed into Monstars.\". She was sitting before her home, turning buttons and stuff with only a swish of her hand or a flicker of a finger, zooming upon a view of two halves, the first half is of the real world back in 1994, with the second half of Looneyland in all its animation. I grinned, \"Do it.\". Portia nodded, and with a flick of a finger, the view has changed completely into the greens of mini golf. I am not a pro like Michael Jordan, and I hope Bugs Bunny can reach here. I shed my jacket, the long-sleeved shirt, and the scarf, leaving me in my tank top, and pants, and sneakers, leaving my old and new tattoos exposed; my encircled wolf paw print, and also a coyote paw print as well. I entered into the portal, with Portia snapping her fingers, to make two golf balls, and two golf clubs appear as well. I took the obvious purple handled club while Portia took the rainbow handled club. As I spent every second here, I felt my age melting away until it stopped, with Portia grinning, \"I got you deaged to 25.\" I smiled, thanking her as I mentally thought of Wile E. Coyote. He must be mentally 45-47 years old in 1994 or is it 1996? Yet physically, I think he is about 28, maybe 29. We chatted for a bit, taking turns as we took shots in our mini golf, going further and further as the portal acted as a wide flat meadow to play around. Then my last shot grabbed our attention, seeing the ball impossibly moving on its own while we knew it was Bugs using a magnet to attract the ball around the hole, and then in. We pat our shoulders, walking to the hole as Portia conjured up a camera, and nodded to me as I got down to reach down, and with a salute toward Portia, a loop caught around my wrist, and I was gone. This is going to be good.[Chapter 2] Hours later- A while after I was introduced to some toons including Bugs and Wile, with a funny check-up by Daffy, and I noticed from the corner of my eye that Wile gave me a 10, which I was proud of. We arrived at the gym, which I was shocked to see the entire mess. If the Looney Tunes didn't fix this up with some spit shine, it definitely would take a couple of humans to fix this place up in a week or so. But luckily, this is Looneyland, and the Looney Tunes are here to fix this with a bit of my help as well. \"Man, you are quick at this mess fixing thing.\". I commented. Porky proudly stuttered, \"But of course, we're the Looney Tunes.\". Daffy added, \"And we're heck proud of it, especially for the Warner Brothers who owns us.\". He showed his backside, showing the Warner Brothers logo, and kissed it, earning me a giggle from it. Then I heard a slow rumble, and the Looney Tunes froze as the sound grew louder and louder, then with a thunderous sound from the doors slamming into the floor or walls, the Monstars showed up. Pound wickedly grinned at me, \"Well, well, what do we have here?\". I snorted and stood up high as I could, \"Sunrise at your service. I am here to play basketball against your team.\". with a crossing of my arms in defense. Bang growled lowly, \"A human playing in a team of wimpy toons?\". Bugs smoothly came forward, \"There's no rules against it. She may be 3-D, but she can play basketball.\". \"Then why can't we play one on one, hmm, sweetheart?\". purred Bupkus. I grinned after a growl at that sickly sweet nickname, \"Hey, red guy, I pick you. What do you say?\". \"Name's Nawt. And I say, let's play!\". Nawt grinned both happily and evilly. We faced after both teams moved off the court, and I slyly smiled, \"Red suits you.\". Nawt chuckled, \"You think so?\". I winked, \"Oh, yes, because you're going to lose!\". I moved swiftly, using my trademark move as I dribbled and then slam-dunked the ball, hearing the Toons cheer for me! I looked straight at the Monstars, \"Don't you dare call me sweetheart, bullies. Otherwise, I will do worse than what I just did to Nawt.\". I pointed to a twisted Nawt, his eyes squeezing widely at me, almost like Bugs were at Lola's one-on-one move. My voice grew into a growl, \"And if you want me off your back, then stop BULLYING MY TEAM!\". They actually drew back at my anger, gulping and nodding, hearing gasps and a voice saying, \"Whoa.\" from my team. The Monstars slowly left with Blanko picking up Nawt gently, and Pound grinned, \"See you at the game, girlie.\". I shot back, \"Bring all you got, ugly.\". Bang growled nearby, with Pound slightly nodding, and they went gone. I exhaled a breath, calming down my anger, as the Looney Tunes crowded me, complimenting and exclaiming. \"That was quite a sight, my dear. You impressed me.\". responded the familiar voice, and I turned to see it revealed as Wile E. Coyote. \"You can talk normal?\". I asked curiously. Wile smiled, \"That voice I did with Bugs, that was just one of the accents I can do. Now this voice is my true accent.\". He's right, his voice is a soft, yet intelligent sounding Southern-Western accent which is actually much better than his shown English-British sounding accent with Bugs. I shyly smiled, \"I really like your true voice, Wile.\". Wile nodded, I swore I saw a bit of blush, but it went gone as it appeared. \"Hey, Sunrise, care to teach us how to play basketball, eh, doc?\". asked Bugs. I nodded, \"Sure, just shoot me a ball.\". Daffy threw the ball over to me as he had picked it up, and I caught it. \"First of all, I gotta show you some drills.\". Murmurs of agreement as I moved, and I yelped as I fell forward. Wile caught me, and I thanked him softly. \"All my pleasure, my dear.\". Wile replied back. I looked back, and sighed as I saw a hole in my hem of one of the pant sleeve. Nawt must have clawed it as I moved around him or something. \"Anyone got shorts I can borrow?\". \"Uh, shorts?\". Bugs asked, and he sheepishly smiled as everybody looked at each other, obviously not wearing shorts. I shook my head, \"Someone better show me the way out of here so I can head to my house and grab my shorts.\". \"Uh-huh, no! You better stay here and train the others. Why can't I go get them for you?\". Daffy asked as he ordered me to stay here. \"I understand, but Daffy, don't be offended, but I don't trust you around my home. I would rather have Bugs and Wile to go instead, because Bugs has the fastest transportation around here, next to cars, and Wile is a gentleman.\". \"You trust me, my dear?\". asked Wile in surprise. I smiled and patted his shoulder, \"Wile, I have to confess something. I have been watching your shows more than any other toon, and that's saying something, for I do see you more than a persistent, hungry coyote. You are intelligent and you have determination no matter what deters your way. So, yes, I trust you, Wile.\". Wile blinked, with a genuine smile, \"No one has ever said that to me before, my dear.\". I looked at him, \"Well, I am glad to be the first one, but you gotta go now. Just be careful, Wile, and you too, Bugs.\". \"Of course, Sunrise. We will take care, doc.\". Bugs smiled at me, and then the duo both left. I looked back at the others, \"Do you at least have some scissors or something I can use?\". Granny smiled, \"I believe I have a pair of scissors for you, darling.\". She popped out some scissors from her purse, and I got them, smiling, \"Thanks, Granny.\". \"Where's the bathroom?\". I asked next. Tweety flew up to me, \"Fallw me! I elp yu!\". I giggled, and smiled, \"Okay, Tweety, lead the way, and while you're waiting, why don't you do warm-ups like a sprint around the court or jumping rope, okay?\". Shouts of yeses, or okays answered me and I then followed Tweety to the bathroom. A thought came to me. I hope the portal is guiding the boys to my home. Oh, no, I didn't tell them my address, oh well, they will figure it out, I think.[Chapter 3] (Wile's P.O.V.) I replied, \"Let's see here, due to her accent, she must live in New York City.\" as I tunneled underground with Bugs at the lead. He stopped for a second, looked at me with these beady eyes, \"You can tell that from Sunrise's voice?\", in a bit of casual awe. I nodded, through I knew Bugs can't see my head, only my eyes, \"Well, doesn't anybody?\". \"Not even me, doc, and Sunrise was right. You are really intelligent, I say.\". Bugs replied. I chuckled, \"Come on, Bugs. We gotta keep going. Miss Sunrise is expecting us back safely after we visit her home.\". Bugs nodded as I saw his eyes bob, then turned around, hearing him tunnel ahead, and I followed him, feeling the moist soil around us. For a bit, we did this, until Bugs fell into a loose spot of the soil and disappeared, and I quickly followed him, blinked with a frown as I fell through, then groaned as I hit hard ground under me. I got up, rubbing my head as Bugs hopped over to me, untangling his ears which strangely got twisted, but, hey, we're toons, anyway. \"Where are we?\". I murmured to Bugs as he looked around, and smiled as he looked back to me, \"Believe it or not, we are in a actually man-made tunnel.\". He was right, I could see the worn cuts in the earth, and the posts to hold the top of the ceiling up. Then I sniffed, my eyes widening in surprise, \"Miss Sunrise has been through here very recently. I can smell her scent.\". Bugs stood in shock, staring at me, then blinked as a thought came to him, \"Of course, I keep forgetting that you have a superb sense of smell. Hey, shall you lead the way since you have the scent, hmm, doc?\". I nodded, \"But, of course.\". I trailed after the scent with Bugs following me behind. We walked a bit before we encountered a ladder up to a crate door. We looked at each other, and Bugs responded, \"The first step is for us, and the first leap is for Looneyland!\", and with that, he hopped right up to the top of the ladder, opening it up as I climbed up, following him. I saw paradise as I saw so much stuff here and there. My imagination went wild, and I think I blanked out until Bugs flicked my nose, and he smirked at me, \"Ahem, Sunrise, remember?\". I grinned sheepishly as my ears went back behind me in embarrassment. I sniffed, finding Sunrise's scent quickly once more, through there were some other scents, but they were so faint already. We exited the place, looking behind to see that it was a garage, and in front of us was a humongous park. I recognized it as Central Park. I pulled Bugs back as I saw humans walking a distance away, \"We can't be seen, Bugs, otherwise we will have a invasion into our world, and you don't want that, do you?!\". I whispered in a panicked tone. Bugs looked at me, \"Good point. Looks we're back to tunneling again, which way we have to go, Wile?\". I sniffed hard this time, the scent heading north for some ways, then east for a bit. I surmised the directions and the amount of tunneling to Bugs, and he nodded, quickly making a hole into the hard ground alongside the garage, and I dived headfirst, landing softly in the moist soil, and then we went on. We surfaced in the backyard behind Sunrise's house, and Bugs whistled as I looked at the townhouse, \"Nice digs, Sunrise sure has some style.\". I nodded, \"She does, indeed.\". We then used the back door, entering when numerous scents hit my nose, and I yipped softly as I gave to attention. Bugs looked at me strangely, \"What's wrong, doc?\". \"Dogs, lots of dogs in this house. I can smell them; injured, sick, and even a couple of pregnant ones too.\". I replied softly. Bugs blinked, hummed, \"Sunrise must be a vet or something to have a lot of dogs in her house.\". I looked at him, \"Let's keep going and find Miss Sunrise's room.\". Bugs nodded, and we walked on, careful not to wake any dogs as we continued up the stairs, and making it into Sunrise's room, and Bugs hummed, \"Let's see here, the closet could be a start.\". He walked over to the closet and opened it up, weaving through every hanger of clothes, and with a shout of triumph, his head came out and looked back at me while I took in the room, Bugs' body turning as his hand revealed to hold basketball shorts, which is blue with stripes of white. \"Nice job, Bugs, and we didn't invade her privacy inappropriately. Let's go..\". My ears perked up as my hearing picked up a distinct yet clear sound. \"Wile?\". Bugs asked curiously. \"One of the pregnant females is in labor. I can hear her whimpers.\". I said bluntly. Bugs widened his eyes, \"Oh, dear. We have to find that girl and help out if we can. I may be a bunny, but I am a toon, and you know toons love to help anyone in trouble!\". I nodded, agreeing with him, and I led him, as I followed the sounds of the dog, exiting Sunrise's room, and entering the second door on the right, and we gasped in surprise when a sudden howl pierced my ears, barely hearing a visible groan from Bugs. Oh, crud.[Chapter 4] (Portia's P.O.V.) \"I know, I know, honey. I am trying to see what's going on, Felicia.\", as I assured the Great Dane. She's young to be pregnant, and the father was a Boxer who had left her after date/mating night, which was not right to me. I knew dogs are much better than that, especially males. Felicia had successfully gave birth to her first pup, but now, she's having trouble with the second puppy as I checked the condition of the puppy inside her. I widened my eyes as I replied, \"Hell, I need Sunrise's help, but I can't leave you, Felicia, honey.\". A voice replied out of nowhere behind me, \"Actually, we can get her, ma'am.\". I turned around to see Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote standing before me, curious yet concerned from the looks they're having. I nodded, \"I think you can help me. Wile, you stay here with Felicia, can you, please?\". \"Of course, ma'am.\". Wile replied politely, making me figure out that Wile was the person who actually spoke behind me. I smiled forlornly, \"Name's Portia.\". I got up, and waved Bugs over as he followed me, \"Come on, Bugs, I got a better way for you to get Sunrise than the long way around.\". I got into Sunrise's room, heading straight for the wide and tall mirror, and placing my right hand, focusing on my inner power inside me, drawing a percent out into the mirror, instantly lighting up into a starlight golden comet chasing its tail around and around inside the mirror portal. I looked over to Bugs, \"Just focus on the place you need to be, and you'll be there in a instant. Get Sunrise back here now. \". Bugs nodded, \"Aye, doc.\". He jumped into the portal, and vanished immediately. I quickly headed back to Felicia and Wile, who's thrilling a soft growl with Felicia who's yipping softly, enabling me to see that Wile can talk with, and understand dogs. (Sunrise's P.O.V.) I whistled as I watched Porky and Elmer play one- on- one on a one side while Lola teaches Daffy to do some throws. Then I saw a portal appear, yet it wasn't the familiar one, since it's a white comet-like portal, then Bugs went through, and landed almost gracefully. \"Bugs?\". I asked in shock. \"Sunrise, hey, there's a emergency at your house. One of the girl dogs is having trouble. Portia don't know what to do.\". Bugs replied bluntly. I gaped, then shook my head, as I turned my head toward the other toons, \"You all take the night off, you have spent quite enough today. Thanks, everybody. I gotta go.\". They all nodded, and I popped inside the portal with Bugs behind me. I appeared out into my beloved room, with Bugs landing more gracefully this time alongside me, and I sprinted to the room where I heard Felicia whimpering in pain. I grabbed my gloves from the dresser, and Wile and Portia backed off to give me room. Felicia was relieved to see me, \"Sunrise, it hurts. I can feel the puppy moving, but it's stuck. I keep pushing, and pushing, and it hurts.\". I replied, \"I know, I am here to help you, Felicia. Just hold on.\". I then checked her through, and felt the puppy, and widened my eyes as I discovered that it was wrapped around its cord. I quickly and softly unwrapped the cord off the puppy, hoping I wasn't too late, and brought it out quickly with a push from Felicia, and I opened the sac, moved it toward Felicia, who quickly licked it all over, and I was relieved instantly when I saw it breathing and whimpering loudly. I stood back and helped occasionally as a few hours passed with Felicia delivering 6 more puppies. Wile, and Bugs was astonished while Portia was impressed with the number of the litter. 8 puppies in all, 4 boys and 4 girls. Felicia is a Blue Brindle Great Dane while the father was a fawn and cream Boxer. Three of the boys took to look like Felicia with a cream underbelly. The first boy, the one I saved, is a solid blue with cream paws. Two of the girls are a fawn brindle, while the other girls are dark brown with black masks. Felicia may be tired after all the labor, but she was proud and she was able to name the puppies in order. Caramel, River, Tiger, Winter, Joy, Petey, Aurora, and Otis. She thanked us greatly, and I nodded, and looked at Portia, \"Good job, Portia.\". \"No problem, chief.\". Portia replied with a smile. I smiled, and left the room with Bugs and Wile. Then I explained about everything I could on the slow walk back to the mirror portal. Bugs was calm and asked a few questions in curiosity, and then handed me a bag that contained my shorts, bid me good night before he hopped into the portal, and went gone, assuming that he had gone home to his rabbit hole in Looneyland. I turned to Wile who was silent the whole way, yet I could see his eyes bright of curious thoughts. \"You okay, Wile?\". I asked. He smiled, \"Never better, my dear. I could never imagine science and magic working together, and with Portia, delightful woman by the way, and you are remarkable in every way possible.\". I giggled shyly, and smiled, \"Thanks, Wile.\". Wile nodded, \"I suppose I should head home now, and see you tomorrow morning, my dear.\". I moved my hair over my ear nervously as I moved forward to face him. \"You have witnessed amazing things tonight because of me, and I am grateful that you didn't freak out about it all.\". I whispered, and Wile grinned at me, \"My dear, I then abide you good night.\". I nodded and then risked a chance to do something quick. I kissed him on the cheek, and giggled, \"Good night, Wile.\". I gently pushed him back toward the mirror portal, smiling all the way as I watched him blushing with a wave and a chuckle, disappearing off to his cave den in Looneyland, I presumed. I then changed into my pajamas, thinking of the kiss I did and went to check on the mother and her pups, and the other dogs, checking their water as I knew Portia had fed them earlier. I then headed back to my bed, looking at the mirror which is off now, being a normal mirror, and fell asleep. I hope tomorrow isn't awkward. as I basically confessed my crush on him. Good night, indeed. I really like the way he calls me, 'my dear', it makes me feel special.[Chapter 5] (Wile's P.O.V.) Next morning- I blinked as I woke up blearily, the sunlight filtering through my two windows, lighting up my cave. I drew my blanket off me as I got up from my palm mattress, curious and perplexed about the vivid dream I was in, and the strange thing is that I wasn't alone. Sunrise was there too. We talked, walked, laughed, and joked with each other, and I couldn't help myself falling in love with her since she had confessed her crush last night before I left her at her house. I never felt so happy before now, and I have felt this strong connection with her. Thinking about Sunrise has woken me up clearly, and I went to grab my iron pan, intending to cook some meat. I hummed as I grabbed my toothbrush and brushed at the sink in my crude kitchen. I smiled at the incredible scenery of my desert home, the Mojave Desert as I looked out the window, and then flipped out the meat into a plate I got out from a cabinet, and grinned as I cut and ate my meat. I knew other coyotes of my race prefer the meat raw, but for myself, I prefer it cooked. Another difference that makes me special, I mused as I knew Sunrise could have said something about this. She would have probably said, \"Wile, you shouldn't care what anybody thinks about you. You are unique all on your own, and you should let anybody know of that.\". I chuckled at the possible thought. After I finished my meal, I quickly brushed my fur, not wanting to look so bristly, when I remembered something said in the dream. \"You know, I really like your fur. It's natural and scruffy, it makes you look rustic, and I like rustic myself.\". Sunrise said when we sat upon a bench before a serene pond. I left the brush off, back on the counter of my table. I then exited my den cave, closing the door after me with the key I got under a rock, locking it up, and putting the key back under the rock. I sprinted around one of my favorite boulders that is storing the catapult. It often helps me get to town quickly under a half hour, as I don't have Ryan (Road Runner)'s superior speed to get there in minutes. Moving the catapult in the right position toward the gym took me quite a few minutes until I found the right propulsion, speed, and accuracy. I took the seat, and cut the rope, and then I was gone from home, shooting through the air piercingly, vaguely seeing Beaky Buzzard flying after a bat, probably going for his breakfast, and passing over mountains, fields, forests, then I saw the town, trying to slow my speed down as I moved my feet forward, and under a minute, my feet touched land as I skidded toward the back doors of the gym, the soil furrowing over me as I slowly got buried. I groaned as I shook dirt and soil from my head, hearing a concerned voice, \"Wile, are you okay?\". I blinked and looked up into the vivid blue eyes of Sunrise who has a concerned smile toward me. I grinned, \"I'll live, my dear.\". A hand came at Sunrise's side, out to give me a lift as I managed to get my paws out of my intended buried hole, and grasped her hand, as she pulled me out. I dusted off myself as I took a good look at Sunrise's wardrobe for today. She's wearing a white tank top with the shorts I and Bugs found yesterday, and her blonde hair was pulled up into a ponytail. \"Looking good, my dear.\". I complimented her, and she giggled, waving a hand in admission, \"Wait until you see my surprise, Wile, then you will compliment yourself!\". she exclaimed in excitement. She nodded toward the doors, and we both opened them, entering into the gym as I saw the rest of the team neither warming up or just talking. \"Okay, Tunes, we are finally all here, and now I can show my surprise. Granny, if you please.\". Sunrise happily announced as I curiously looked at her, then Granny as she was holding a rope, then pulled it, opening up a curtain I didn't note until now, revealing the uniforms for the team. I saw mine, having W. Coyote and the number 13 on the back of my uniform, as I knew I told Sunrise that 13 is both my lucky and unlucky number. \"Tune Squad? I think it should be called 'The Ducks.\". Daffy complained. Bugs raised a eyebrow, and replied, \"It was Coach's idea, not yours, doc.\". Sunrise replied, \"We are wearing them tonight in the big game, I am showing them right now since you are my team, but you can't show them today until tonight, for you want to give the audience the heck of the surprise. Who knows there might be anybody taking pictures, hmm?\". Lola smiled, \"Good point there. We definitively want to give the audience a show, eh, fellas?\". Everybody agreed, nodding and saying yeah or yes. Sunrise smiled, and responded, \"Go ahead, get your uniforms, and put them in the lockers in our home locker room. I already have mine in there.\". I immediately obeyed her as I don't want a pissed off Sunrise on my back, for I partly saw a percent of her temper toward the Monstars yesterday. I returned, immediately practicing drills and all the skills Sunrise took to show and teach us all day with breaks. On Lunch Break, I actually offered Sunrise for a tour around town for a while before we returned back to practice some more, stopping at 2:00 to take some rest and all before the big game begins at 6:00. Sunrise will get us as the winners, I am sure of it through I have a bad feeling. I just hope I am wrong about that feeling.[Chapter 6] (Sunrise's P . O.V.)- Tonight, The Big Game- I smiled as I used the bathroom to change into my new beloved uniform, the blue contrasting with the white, with Tune Squad in black and orange on front, and my name and number on back, feeling strangely comfortable and safe. I exited the door, grinning at all the impressed/awed looks as the toons took me all in, especially Wile. \"You look fantastic, my dear.\". Wile complimented happily. I chuckled, \"Thanks, you look amazing.\". Wile grinned at me, nodding silently as he took my compliment. I then asked, \"Ready, fellas?\". They shouted in agreement, nodding or saying neither yes, or yeah. We set out and left the locker room, waiting for our cues. I heard Bertie announce introduce my team one by one, and smiled when I saw Wile in shock over the applause for him, then it was my turn. \"And now, coach and player, coming from New York City, standing from 5 feet and 6 inches, I give you Chief Sunrise!\". Bertie shouted as I ran out, applause filling my ears. I snorted to myself, rolling my eyes slightly as the Monstars showed up, showing off tremendously, as it's a wonder why the stadium didn't break down at their antics. I gave a short pep talk to everybody, \"Okay, team, forget this is a race to save Looneyland, just focus on your skills, and score us lots of points, and most of all, have fun!\". They shouted, \"Tune Squad!\". We then began the game with anticipation, excitement, hope. However, I came to find that the Monstars are more vicious in playing than I thought when I saw the movie back in my own time. We drilled, shot, played, and moved all we could through the 1st and 2nd quarter, however when Halftime came, my team was so disheartened, that I knew I had to peek through the Monstars' locker room door, and sure enough, I overheard that they once more took the powers from the superstars, and left quickly to my locker room. \"Guys, I overheard the reason why the Monstars are so good and big. Turns out they took powers from some basketball superstars.\". I replied out as I entered, seeing the Toons sitting, cradling bags of ice to their necks, knees, and feet, as I knew they felt sore from the 1st half of the game. Bugs gasped, \"Now everything makes sense!\". Wile growled, \"How dare they cheat like this?!\". I shrugged, and responded, \"Beats me, Wile.\". Porky then asked, \"Can we forfeit?\". \"Heck, no. We have risked too much into this, and do you want to disappoint all of Looneyland, hmm?\". I retorted sharply. Answers of No came out, and I nodded, with Bugs smiling and throwing a bottle to me, reading 'My Stuff'. \"Hey, guys, what bout a energy boost drink, huh?\". I shook the bottle, and Wile gently took it from me, \"I could use a bit, my dear.\". He drank a bit, then threw the bottle toward Porky, then every toon took turns with Daffy being last. We went back into court, re energized and determined to finish this game, with glares and growls toward the Monstars. We quickly did the 3rd Quarter well, then came the fateful timeout. Swackhammer snarled to the Monstars, \"Why didn't you pick her?\". Pound replied, \"She was not a superstar, so just a normal girlie.\". I shouted, \"Hey, don't call me girlie, bully.\". Pound snarled at me, with Swackhammer replying, \"Well, well, Swackhammer's the name, do you want to talk?\". \"Yeah, man, if you want to talk, I am here!\". I responded, then Swackhammer chuckled. \"What do you have in mind?\". I replied, \"What do you say we get the stakes up higher?\". \"Interesting, and if you win?\". he asked, and I shot my head, \"Your Monstars return the powers back to the players up above, and you never return back here again.\". \"And if we win?\". Swackhammer deviously asked, and I glared, \"You get me, and I will play for you forever.\". I heard horrified gasps behind me, and Swackhammer grinned, \"Deal.\". I gave my hand and shook to officiate the deal forever, and we separated ways, with me slyly wiping my hand off my side. Wile and Bugs swiftly came up at my side, \"Are you certain of this, my dear?\". Bugs nodded, \"Yeah, why did you do that?\". I looked at him and Wile with a serious grim smile, \"Because you're my friends, and all of you are part of my family. Family means no one gets left behind or forgotten.\". My team heard every word, nodded as I saw their eyes fill again of determination, especially Bugs and Wile, and returned to the game. The Monstars became more vicious than ever before, and they had us trapped in every corner, hurting and bullying every toon of my team. I and Lola was looking for a clear spot to capture the ball from the Monstars, when I heard Bugs and Wile call for us, \"Lola! Sunrise! Heads up!'. I saw the shadow and turned around, and screamed shrilly as I saw my life flashing by, being pushed, and grunting as I rolled away, and looked up, shocked, yelled, \"TIME OUT!\". \"Wile, Wile!\". I yelled as I ran to a smashed, then conciliating Wile upon the floor, barely hearing the whistle, and the audience gasp out of shock and alarm. I held Wile up, asked, \"Are you okay, Wile?\". Wile blinked his golden eyes, \"More like are you alright, my dear?\". I frowned, \"I am fine. Why did you do that?\". \"Because I very much care for you.\". Wile whispered softly, I blinked, \"You mean..?\". Wile blushed, \"I am in love with you, Sunrise.\". I exhaled a breath, and smiled, \"Then I love you too!\". I cuddled his snout and then kissed him, barely seeing his ears shoot up in surprise, then feeling him return the kiss. Neither one is noticing the changes that's happening to Sunrise yet the whole stadium is.[Chapter 7] (No One's P.O.V.)- The whole stadium is staring as one person is changing before their eyes. The coach-player of the Tune Squad, Chief Sunrise is becoming 2-D every second from her shoes to the last strand of her blonde hair, then flawless changes began, her human ears moved upward, and grew wider and taller, her nose and mouth is becoming a snout, her tailbone began growing into a long tail, and her shoes became shredded as her feet grew out, doubling two sizes bigger, and her hands became longer, with her nails becoming sharp and tough, and her skin began sprouting fur all over, with her blonde hair shrinking back into fur. She has changed into a coywolf (Half wolf/ half coyote, with a bit of dog). Sunrise's pelt is snowy white with a wide blonde stripe from the forehead to the back between her shoulders with tan paws. She resembles much of a coyote with a wolf-like tail, and her paws are wolf-size, and her mouth has wolf-like incisors, and the jaw are more of a wolf jaw. Altogether, she is similar to Wile. Her eyes opened to reveal the only human feature she has, her beloved dark blue color, and she was looking at Wile who recently opened his eyes, and gaping in shock. (Wile's P.O.V.) \"Wile, you're staring at me, do I have some dirt or something on me?\". Sunrise asked. I gulped, and replied, \"My dear, look at your hands.\". Sunrise frowned and looked at her paws, and gasped in shock and looked down at herself, and asked, \"Anyone has a mirror?\". \"Here, darling.\". Granny came over and drew out a mirror from her bag, and gave it to Sunrise, who took it, and traced her features as she looked at the mirror. \"Wow, I am a toon, and a canid at that. Portia knew this was coming...\". I smiled, \"You look gorgeous, Sunrise.\". Sunrise looked over at me, moving the mirror downwards, grinning, \"This is awesome.\". She kissed me again, hugging me, as I felt her new fur as it's so soft and lovely. The stadium cheered and applauded for us as we pulled back, got up, and went back to the bench where the team was congratulating us, and they were awed and impressed of Sunrise's new look. I winced as I looked at the bench-warmers, for they are injured worse than me. Sunrise was met by Martian, \"Excuse me, Ms. Sunrise, but you are one teammate short. You need a fifth player or you are forfeited.\". Sunrise sighed, \"Great. The only time I need help, and I can't find a fifth player.\". \"Hey, what about a old friend?!\". called out a familiar voice. I looked over as Sunrise and the others did, seeing a cloud-white haired. rainbow-eyed, ivory skinned 3-D human woman grin at us, uniformed in the same team uniform as us, smiling with Bugs grinning as we recognized her. It was Portia. I heard Swackhammer shout, \"Whoa! I didn't know we had a Reese Witherspoon impersonator in this story!\". Portia grinned at us, \"Who's ready to play?!\". Sunrise smiled, \"She's our fifth player. Hey, Portia.\", as Portia got closer, and nodded at her. Sunrise looked at us, \"Alright, guys. We're on defense. Lola, you're on center, Bugs, right corner, Daffy, left corner, Portia, bottom corner, and for me, I will take the middle corner. Sorry, Wile, but you're exhausted and probably sore.\". I nodded, \"I understand, my dear. Just beat them for me, yeah?\". Sunrise deviously grinned, \"Don't worry, you'll love it, Wile.\". I chuckled, and the toons plus Portia broke up, and went to their positions. I hope with Portia, we win this game. I don't want to lose Sunrise forever as I love her so much. I looked at the scoreboard, sighed as I saw that only a minute was left in the game. Such so little time yet it'll be quick, I hope.[Chapter 8] (Portia's P.O.V.) As I got to my position, I felt a tug from my shorts and I looked down at Daffy. \"Oh, hey, Daffy.\". \"Hello, Miss Portia. Mind if I ask you something?\". asked Daffy curiously. \"No, go ahead.\". I replied. Daffy rubbed his eyes, then glanced, \"How did you get down here, anyway?\". I blinked, \"Oh, by use of my portal. I am a old friend of Sunrise, and the writer alarmed me about Sunrise's trouble, so I am here.\". Daffy raised a eyebrow, \"Oh, so it figures, huh.\". A growl was behind me, and I looked over to see Bang behind, and grinned as I remembered something. \"Daffy, see that guy behind me?\". Daffy excitedly asked, \"Yeah?\". I leaned down, whispered into Daffy's inner ear the plan, with Daffy complimenting, \"That's good. Yep, I gotcha ya.\". \"Great, you're the duck, Daffy.\". I responded with a wink at him, as the game resumed, with Bang receiving the ball as Daffy headbutted him like a football player, and I grinned as I caught it. I dribbled, then shot it over to Bugs, running as I saw Bugs shot the ball over to Daffy, who dodged a Monstar attack, and dribbled once before shooting over to Lola, who did a spin as she dribbled, the Monstars crowding her. \"Open, I am open!\". Sunrise shouted, and Lola did a Power Up move then a Jump pass, and shot the ball over to Sunrise who caught it. I called out, \"Do the big move!\". Sunrise grinned as she understood my meaning. She dribbled, then jumped upon the back of Pound who fell early, then jumped, and then shot. I held my breath as the audience roared, and I saw the team moving as they stared after the ball even as Sunrise touched ground. The ball soared, then hit the backboard, then went IN! The whistle sounded to say that we won, and the audience got louder, cheering as it shook the rafters and I laughed, clapping Sunrise on the back, grinning, \"Knew you could get that down!\". Sunrise chuckled, \"Lucky we disguised the name in practice games back home otherwise people could know that it's a 3-pointer.\". The team crowded us, grinning and congratulating us, with Sunrise receiving a passionate kiss from Wile which the audience applauded louder at. I smiled. Bugs then got over to me, \"Say, Portia, what do you say to having a party with us, doc?\". \"Nah, Bugs. I gotta go back home, Felicia needs me, as it turns out Little River is having trouble with his siblings.\". Bugs smiled, and nodded, \"Neither way, it was great to have you here.\". I grinned, \"Thanks, Bugs. Hey, Sunrise and Wile, congrats for getting together. I could never thought she would get a toon like you, but I am happy for you guys. I got to pop back home. Portal's open if you two want to visit later tonight.\". \"Thank you, Miss Portia.\". Wile thanked me, with Sunrise nodding at me. I left the stadium in a run after I waved goodbye, and popped back to the townhouse. (Sunrise's P.O.V.) I frowned as I heard Swackhammer bully and shout at the Monstars, and shouted, \"Hey, stop that, or I will have Yosemite Sam arrest you for abusing your team.\". \"Or what, sweetheart?\". I growled at Swackhammer's answer, my eyes burning in fury, and I jumped into him, biting and scratching him as dust swirled around us, with Swackhammer yelling in pain. I hopped off him, still growling as I grabbed his coat, dragging him over to the acme rocket, stuffed him, and ignited the soot as I heard Swackhammer shouting in pleas, and screams as the rocket went off, heading through the WB portal, through the earth, toward the moon. Meanwhile, the team was overly impressed yet scared about Sunrise's temper, and promising not to get on her bad side ever, ever. I snorted, cleaning my hands as I signified that I was done with him. I walked over, my temper going away, as I glanced at the shocked yet humbled Monstars. \"Now, Swackhammer is gone. He won't abuse you anymore.\". \"Gee, nobody ever did that before for us.\". Blanko replied, with Nawt saying, \"Yeah.\", with the others nodding in agreement. I smiled friendly, \"You are more than what you think. Bugs, please give me the ball.\". Bugs smiled as he shot the ball over to me, and I held it up. \"Guys, it's time for you to hold up your deal, please.\". I replied sternly. Pound frowned, \"Do we have to, man?\". I raised an eyebrow, \"You started it, so you have to end it.\". Nawt smiled up to his friends, \"She's right.\". He put his hand upon the ball, with the others looking at each other and murmuring softly as they joined their hands upon the ball as well. The ball trembled as the Monstars glowed and shimmered as the visible powers transferred into the ball, with the Monstars shrinking back into the Nerdlucks. I smiled at Wile, \"So, now what?\". \"Actually, now we're to party!\". announced Daffy as the ceiling opened up bigger, with disco balls at every corner, and music booming under the stands as the stands shrunk back, allowing everybody to plow into the stadium, with fireworks lighting up the early night sky. A song came on, revealing Speedy the Mexican mouse, and Hubie, Bertie, on the stage that was the announcer's podium. Wile grinned, and asked, \"Care to dance, my dear?\". I giggled, \"I'd love to, Wile.\". We danced all night to this particular song, through there were some other songs, but this song became my favorite one for it was my first dance with Wile as a memory. \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls. I feel a premonition that girl's gonna make me fall. She's into new sensations new kicks in the candle light. She's got a new addiction for every day and night. She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain like a bullet to your brain. Come On! [CHORUS:] Upside, inside out she's livin la vida loca She'll push and pull you down, livin la vida loca Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color mocha She will wear you out livin la vida loca Come On! Livin la vida loca, Come on! She's livin la vida loca. Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel She took my heart and she took my money she must've slipped me a sleeping pill She never drinks the water and makes you order French Champagne Once you've had a taste of her you'll never be the same Yeah, she'll make you go insane. [CHORUS] She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain like a bullet to your brain. Come On![Chapter 9] (Wile's P.O.V.) I traded hugs and goodbyes to everybody with Sunrise at my side, and Bugs replied, \"Thanks for getting us out of this huge mess, doc.\". Sunrise chuckled, \"Anything for a friend, Bugs. Now, I gotta go with Wile.\". Bugs nodded, \"Sure, see you around, fellas.\". I smiled with Sunrise nodding then she turned for a moment, replied, \"And, Bugs, stay out of trouble.\". I heard Bugs reply, \"Oh, I won't, doc.\". I heard Lola giggle, and the sound of a smooching kiss. I shook my head as we exited the stadium, looking at Looneyland's stars. Sunrise pressed a hand on her chest, touching something I couldn't see, and the portal appeared, and I bowed my head, \"My dear, ladies first.\". Sunrise giggled and touched my chin, rubbing it as it lulled me so nicely as I rumbled softly of little growls to say that I liked it, and her hand disappeared, disappointing me for a second, but I knew she had hopped into the portal, and with a glance at the still loud stadium, I jumped into the portal, and instantly transferred to pop into Sunrise's room, unknowing that I was changed. A gasp came from Sunrise as she looked at me, being 3D human again, \"Uh, Wile, look behind you.\". Confused, I turned around and shrieked a bit as I jumped back in surprise. A human 3-D man was staring back at me, and I slowly recognized that this man's reflection was actually me. My coyote 2-D toon body was gone. My golden sclera in my eyes were gone, now white with the iris being a dark cinnamon brown. My chocolate brown fur was gone, leaving me a patch of chocolate brown hair on top, which I figured in comparison that I looked like a Navajo Indian, looking scruffy yet handsome. My teeth is human and pearl white, and my skin is a dark copper tone. I still had my team uniform on, which I was grateful for, and looking at my hands and feet, previously being paws, having 20 in all, and in height comparison against Sunrise, I figured I am around 5'4\". Sunrise smiled and blushed as she took me in, \"You're really cute, Wile.\". I nodded, smiling as I replied, \"Thank you, my dear.\". Sunrise giggled, then dragged me gently, into the bathroom, \"Now, I got to show you something cool and neat, honey.\". I blinked, \"'Honey'?\". Sunrise ducked her head down, embarrassed, \"Sorry, I apologize about not asking your permission about that. It's just that you call me 'my dear', and I really like it, and I don't mind it all.\". I chucked gently, \"No, no, Sunrise. I like 'Honey'. I just never had a wonderful lady like you in my life before, and I don't mind, my dear.\". Sunrise sighed in relief as she looked at me with a uncertain smile, and I smiled back to reassure her that I really don't mind being 'Honey'. Sunrise's smile grew bigger into a delighted grin. She then showed me an amazing thing in the shower, she called it a jet. She left me with instructions how to use the shower, and promising to show up with clothes for me to change into as I asked her happily to go out on a date tonight, and she accepted quite excitedly. After I had finished, I had wondered why I never had this in my cave den, and smiled as I got used to the new clothes, a nice blue t-shirt with a black jacket, with blue jeans, and the new shoes I had tried for the first time, surprisingly comfortable. It was Sunrise's turn, bringing in a bag of clothes I couldn't see, with Sunrise saying that it's a secret until she's finished. I sat upon the nook, looking out at all the alight buildings, and dim stars of New York City. I could vaguely hear sirens in the distance, as I grabbed a random book under the bench shelf of the nook, and reading for a while, allured to the incredible scripture of the writing used in the book, learning a couple of lessons from Brian. \"I see you're enjoying 'Hatchet'. replied Sunrise distantly. I startled, surprised as the book fell out of my hands as I blushed in embarrassment, \"Sorry, sorry, it looked so interesting. I thought I would do something while waiting for you, my dear.\". I grabbed the book and closed it, turning around when I froze, gaping in awe and surprise as I took Sunrise in. She had her blonde hair partially curled, with a bit as a mini ponytail, a emerald necklace touching down to her chest, and from there with sashes upon her shoulders, a luxurious, yet simple purple dress that hugged her hips and reached below her knees, with her feet covered in black flats. I exhaled, as I swore my eyes had turned canine style for a minute, speaking softly as I didn't want to break the fragile atmosphere, \"You look beautiful.\". Sunrise giggled as she brushed a strand from her forehead, \"Thanks, Wile.\". I smiled, as I came closer, and offered my arm in a polite gesture, \"Shall we go for our date, my dear?\". \"Of course, honey.\". Sunrise nodded as she grabbed my arm with her arm, and walking in unison, and for the first time ever as I could remember, I am able to go out into the 3-D world without fear of humans panicking over any appearance of a toon. This is incredible, walking in the human world upside.[Chapter 10] (Sunrise's P.O.V.) -A few hours later- I laughed at Wile's joke, and said, \"You should be a comedian, Wile!\". Wile took a contemplative smile at that, \"You know, since we're boyfriend and girlfriend, I want to support you, and I think I could take on being a comedian at nighttime after I have finished my day job, which is being in my share of cartoons, and chasing Ryan, which by the way is the Roadrunner, if you don't know already.\". We had spent our date dinner upon a casual yet romantic restaurant, with a excited Wile anxious to try my favorites, and maybe find a few favorites of his own after I had drove my own car which has been staying in the basement garage. While not surprisingly, Wile had tried everything I had ordered, yet he surprised me at the gusto as he went after the vension. I thought he could've ordered the lamb chops, yet he went for the vension. After our dinner, we then hit the theater, asked Wile to pick something for us to watch, and going for funny, he chose one that seemed interesting. Wile was enraptured as he watched the movie, and we both laughed at the antics the main character got himself into, and the few jokes by the henchmen of the frustrated yet intelligent villain. Now, we are heading back to the car as Wile did jokes of his own, making me laugh. I replied, \"If that is what you wish to do, then you have my permission, honey.\". Wile smiled widely at me, then he jerked up, his eyes looking right and left, and tilting his head to the right. \"Wile?\". I asked concerned for him. Wile whispered, \"I think my ears are still increased in hearing as I am listening to something in the distance. I couldn't make it out, but it sounds sad.\". I nodded as Wile made sense. I knew Navajo Indians had increased senses to survive in the desert as I know there is dangers out there and they still are. Wile's coyote hearing may be gone, and dulled down to human hearing, but with his environment of living, he has instincts to listen for food or danger, etc. I shook Wile's shoulder, \"Then what are we waiting for? Come on, it could be a injured dog or something.\". Wile nodded and led the way as he had the higher hearing than I do. As we got into a few minutes, now I can vaguely hear crying yet the cries surprised me as they're actually human, not dog. I remembered the discovery of Baelfire/Soulheart, and realized that we got a abandoned baby now in somewhere out there. Wile has realized similarly too, and we walked faster, hearing the baby cries as we tried to focus to locate it, and Wile then stopped, turned his head toward a alley, and with a glance at me, he gave a small nod, as he had pinpointed the source of the baby cries. I can hear it easily now, getting louder yet I can also hear whimpering too. I widened my eyes as the whimpering is familiar in a way, it's a puppy's voice. We got closer and closer as I was able to lay eyes upon a box where both the baby and the puppy is, and Wile looked concerned at me as we both proceeded to peek over the box, and I gasped softly as I held a hand to my mouth, \"Oh, my.\". Inside the box, the baby is gratefully lying on its back, yet by its side, resting is the young puppy. The baby was clothed in towels, which I was relieved to see, yet I was worried as the baby is only a few months old, and looking pale, too pale, I notice. The puppy saw me, growled lowly as he protected his friend. I murmured to the little guy, \"Hey, we're worried about you guys. Have you heard of the Stray Vet? That's me.\". The 3-month old puppy looked surprised then replied, \"Baby has been left for hours when I found him. He feels hot.\". I moved my hands and looked between the baby and the puppy, and the puppy nodded, giving permission for me to get the baby. I quickly held the baby, frowned as I felt his forehead, \"Hell, Wile, he has a fever, a bad one.\". Wile poked a finger gently among the baby's cheek, and replied, \"I am afraid that you are right. Let's hurry before he gets any sicker.\". Wile then glanced at the puppy, did a thrilling yip, and the puppy nodded, put its front paws up as Wile picked him up. Then we ran to the car, giving the baby to Wile as he put the puppy on his lap after he seat-belted himself, and I took the wheel as I seat-belted myself. We then drove off, glancing at the extra passengers. Both of them looks clean enough, but who knows what things they have contracted, especially the little baby who has a fever. From observing while at red lights, the baby looks like a mixed Greek American, yet his eyes surprised me. His eyes are grass green, while his hair is hazelnut brown, and his skin is pale from the fever, but I can tell that it's at least a light copper tan tone. When I held him, he felt, I don't know, a bit underweight than he should be for his age. As for the puppy, as it still has its baby features, I figure him to be a Chihuahua mix. He has dark markings against his main tan pelt, and his eyes are hazel. Wile whispered quickly, \"The baby's still hot, I gonna try something here as the ac isn't working.\". I nodded as Wile grabbed his bottle and a handkerchief, dabbed the fabric easily as his lap held the baby securely, as the puppy rested at his feet, his paws clutching at the mat. Glancing as I drove to the nearest children's hospital as I knew the people there are really skilled with healing and helping children and babies, Wile gently dabbed at the baby's forehead and skin, hoping to get the fever down. I sighed heavily, \"This is crazy yet miraculous. We have been lucky to find these two otherwise who knows how much longer the baby would last?\". \"I hope fortune's looking on us, because the little guy's still having the fever, I am not having any luck here.\". Wile replied quickly. I nodded, and as I had the last red stop before the hospital, I glanced at the baby, and he looked straight at me with these grass green eyes. I felt something big as we connected eyes, like I and Wile was meant to be with him. He seemed to remind me of someone. I murmured, \"I think I want to name him because I am getting a connection already.\". \"You too, my dear? I feel the same too.\". said a surprised Wile. I smiled, \"What do you think about calling him, 'Brian Hippocrates'?\". \"After the book, and his Greek heritage, correct?\". Wile smiled as he asked. I smirked, \"You know me well, honey.\". Wile chuckled, then held little Brian and the little puppy tightly as I turned a tight corner into the hospital area, heading to emergency. I hope we saved Brian in time. Please, lord, please look after our foundling.[Chapter 11] (Wile's P.O.V.) -A month later- Epilogue I checked my watch again for the sixth time, as I stood upon the podium alone, feeling a arm jab me gently, startling to look at Bugs, who's smiling playfully. \"Wile, don't fret yourself, Sunrise will be here soon enough, am I right, doc?\". I smiled, nodding as I opted to agree with my friend. \"Of course you're right. Sunrise won't be late for her own wedding.\". Bugs looked confident at that, as he was dressed in a dark blue tuxedo. I myself was dressed in a jet black tuxedo. I looked out to see the audience, mixed around with 2-D toons and 3-D Sunrise's warriors along with the dogs I have helped out with Sunrise. I know getting married in a month since our first meeting seems far-fetched, but we have been through a lot, praying and fighting for little Brian until we succeeded. Brian was a news sensation since he was left alone in a box, apparently for hours which the doctors has assumed just like our puppy, which we named 'Sherman' as he told us that his mom called him and his siblings only a letter of the abc alphabet. More than a fever which Brian had, he also was checked for many other things, one thing was obvious, malnourished. I sighed lightly as I fingered my engagement collar. Sunrise had the crazy yet logical idea. Due to our canine ways, it made sense to wear collars to symbol that we belong to each other; engagement. My collar's fabric itself is a soft leather in brown, stitched with Viking Runes which one of Sunrise's old warriors were happy to help with. Two words rings almost around the collar; Love and Family, and the stitching itself is both light red, and light blue. There's a totem at front with a small gemstone; a realistic coyote curling around a olive green emerald gemstone, standing for peace and my coyote heritage. Last I saw Sunrise, she has been wearing her engagement collar. Again in brown soft leather, Viking Runes has been stitched in, being light yellow and light red, and there are two words almost around the collar once more; Loyalty and Family. Her beloved totem, which is a combination of the sun and moon, now has a small gemstone on front; a pink gemstone, standing for love and friendship, and her clan. Then a familiar song began, soft and peaceful this time, and I looked straight, smiling as I saw Lola in a light blue dress, carrying Brian who's in a cute little gray tuxedo. Sunrise was right about Brian being Greek, but at the hospital, we found that he's also African as well, making sense for his looks and features; being a official Greek-African American boy. We adopted him successfully a few days after he was recovered from the hospital, just need to put down his last name as soon as I and Sunrise get married today. Then I heard Sherman's familiar paw-steps, bearing a dark blue tie around his neck. I forgot to mention that we found that his mom is a Purebred Husky, and his dad is a Mexican Chihuahua, making Sherman a Chusky (Chihuahua/Husky), which is Sunrise's name for the breed, not mine. The 4 month-old pup went to sit at my side while Lola joined Bugs, with Brian being gently tickled by Bugs, which Brian gave out a giggle. I chuckled at the joy of the little guy, then I went breathless when I saw..her. She shone like the sun was alighting herself, her gorgeous white gown hugging her hips and curves, with her blonde hair framed around her face, and her bright blue eyes glanced up at me, and gave a radiant, loving smile as I exhaled, \"Wow.\". I heard Bugs whisper in awe, \"You're a lucky guy, Wile.\". I nodded slightly, and I smiled toward Sunrise, who's walking toward me. I held out a hand to grasp Sunrise's hand, and whispered gently, \"You look beautiful, my dear.\". Sunrise let out a giggle, \"You look handsome too, honey.\". We now are together, standing on the podium as the portal alighted bright, flashing once to let Portia out, who's wearing a lovely pink dress, and she's the officiant of the wedding. The wedding went well as we had hoped, with the last words to finalize our wedding. \"Sunrise, do you swear to uphold your morals, to become a wife to Wile as long as you live, in sickness and health, and in 2-D or 3-D?\". Sunrise smiled at me, replied, \"I do.\". Portia then asked me, \"Wile, do you swear to uphold your morals, to become a husband to Sunrise as long as you live, in sickness and health, and in 2-D or 3-D?\". I proudly smiled, \"I do.\". \"Then before the old clan and the best of both worlds in this family, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\". Portia then announced, and I smiled, grabbing Sunrise gently against me, gently grasping her hands, as I saw her leak tears as I leaned forward, and we kissed, vaguely hearing Bugs sob, \"Oh, I swore I couldn't cry, and I am crying.\". (Portia's P.O.V.) I gasped at the power the kiss is producing, the golden/white flashing and enveloping the duo as they floated up, and I vaguely saw the collars changing into bright energies that zoomed to their right arms and ring fingers, and I heard a yelp-scream from Sherman, looking over to see him floating up too, surprising me as he changed shape and body into a human boy of 4 years old. The group then floated down as the power disappeared, leaving them just fine and well, with a shocked human Sherman falling on his behind as he tried to balance himself. With deep sight, I was able to see wedding bands on Sunrise and Wile's ring fingers, seeing gold with their chosen gemstones, and the Viking Runes. I saw Sunrise's right arm now bearing a new tattoo which is the sun/moon totem, and I presumed that Wile has the curled up coyote on his right arm as well since he's wearing a jacket over a button shirt. I looked at Sherman as I took him in. He now has spiky dark hair, with tan skin, and his eyes remain hazel, average for his height, due to his age now. Sunrise and Wile looked confused, and Sunrise asked me, \"Why is Sherman human now?\". I shrugged thoughtfully, \"The power must have heard Sherman's wish.\". \"Which is?\". Wile then asked, and I started to speak, but Sherman suddenly spoke. \"W-wait. Wish coming true. Wanting to have family. Being human scary but want to make you happy.\". Sunrise looked shocked at that, \"You wanted us to be your parents, Sherman?\". Sherman ducked his head, and nodded shyly, and Wile looked at Sunrise. \"You know, my dear, I would never expect so many surprises in one day, but this one takes the cake. Do you know that I wanted another son, a new brother for Brian?\". Wile confessed happily, and Sunrise blinked, seemed to think for a moment, then smiled as she walked over to Sherman, tilted his head up as eyes met, dark blue to hazel, \"You have made me happy, sweetheart.\". \"R-really?\". asked Sherman hopefully. Sunrise smiled, and picked Sherman up, resting him against her body, replying, \"Really, really.\". Wile received Brian from Lola, walked over to his family, and smiled at them, \"This is a happy ending for us all.\". He then kissed Sunrise, Brian and Sherman giggling in delight, while the audience then cheered. I then knew I had to do something, a gift. I sticked out my tongue as I swirled my hands, focusing my power to conjure out a very important document, and I smiled as I knew I had succeeded. I then walked over, smiling. \"A gift for you all.\". I handed the document, and Sunrise received it, gasped, causing Wile to look over too, and smiling in delight. The document was the official adoption paper for Sherman. I then conjured up a table with a pencil, with Wile bringing out Brian's adoption paper as well, putting both documents on the table. Wile writing first upon Brian's document, writing down the official last name, which is Coyote. Sunrise then took her turn, writing down Sherman's name and the last name upon Sherman's document. Sunrise then asked, \"Do you have a name you like, honey? We need one for your middle name.\". Sherman shook his head, \"Sorry, Mommy, I don't know any.\". Wile then grinned, \"Then since Sunrise had her turn with Brian, I am proud to say that it's my turn to find the perfect middle name for you, son, and I think I have one.\". The audience leaned forward to hear Wile's answer as I did, earning Wile's chuckle at our curiosity. \"His middle name shall be Enrique!\". He announced. The audience approved hugely as I nodded. Wile wrote it down happily, and he then picked up the documents, showing the audience who cheered. The small family smiled and laughed, and celebrated together with the audience, chatting and having fun. I sighed lightly, knowing one true fact. Happily ever afters are reached after all. The clan has finally come to a end, yet everybody doesn't forget the big motto, \"Ohana is family, and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten\". Our stories aren't ending, they are only beginning. ","Summary":" DimensionTraveler23 or Traveler here to tell you quite some things. First of all, my very first ser"},{"Movie":"Swing Kids","Title":"Love in a Time of War","Author":"fanwriter1245","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11044151","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Life was tough in the 40's. Media propaganda all told people how to live and think, Nazis were on the rise, and war broke out with many people looking up to Hitler. Anna was not one of those people. She never said it aloud for fear of incurring the wrath of her fellow peers, or worse, the HJ, but she despised Hitler. She felt like he was blaming everything going wrong on one religious group. Sadly, she never defended Jews because of her fears, but she would never, ever hurt one either. Her brother had fallen in love with a Jewish woman some years ago. She had been so kind and so beautiful and their love was a rare but true one. Then one day, he was found out and was taken away from them. She could still hear her mother's screams as his ashes were delivered to them in a box. Her mother had gone into depression and stopped eating and later died from malnutrition. After losing both her brother and mother, Anna rarely left her home, afraid that she would end with a similar fate. That all changed when her friend, Elaine, went to her house and told her to get dressed because they were going to the Bismarck. Anna tried to get out of it, but Elaine was persistent. She wanted to cheer Anna up and told her she understood what she was going through because she had lost her father to the Nazis. At that, Anna relented and Elaine helped her choose a dress to wear. Thomas Berger was your average teenager. He had his group of close friends, he loved to swing dance, he desperately needed a haircut, he loved talking about and flirting with girls, and his personality was…well, indescribable to say the least. As often as he could, he and his friends Peter, Arvid, and Otto would go out swing dancing at the Bismarck and try to pick up girls along the way. Currently, all the boys were sitting at their table taking a break from dancing. Most of them were pouring sweat from the intensity of their dances, but so was everyone else in the place so it didn't really matter. Thomas's eyes fell to the door and he caught sight of a girl. A gorgeous girl at that. As he watched her, it seemed like she was walking through the door in slow motion. Her brown hair was half tied up while the rest of it was nearly flat reaching to the middle of her back. As she turned, it glided over her shoulder in one smooth perfect motion. She was smiling, but her smile was clearly not a completely real one. It was still so beautiful that he could only imagine what a real smile looked like. \"Hey, Thomas,\" Peter said, trying to keep in his laughter. \"Put your eyes back in your head, why don't you?\" Thomas didn't respond, still keeping his eye on the girl. She and her friend sat down at a table not too far from theirs. They talked for a little while as the girl looked around her in awe. It must've been her first time. Without thinking about it, he went over to the table and extended his hand to her. \"Care to dance?\" She looked at him with a bashful smile. \"I don't know how to do all of those moves,\" she said gesturing to the dance floor where couples were swing dancing wildly. \"It's easy. I'll show you.\" She looked at her friend, who nodded back at her. Then she timidly took Thomas's awaiting hand and he led her to the dance floor. Thomas took both of her hands in his. \"Just follow my lead,\" he told her. He began to lead her in a very simple swing dance, and she picked it up pretty fast. There was a problem, though. She was holding back. \"Let it go,\" Thomas said in her ear. \"No one cares what you do.\" Anna looked at the boy she had just met. She had to admit that he was really attractive, besides the whole long hair situation he had going on. At his words, she slowly began to pick up her step. \"There ya go!\" Thomas praised. Anna gave him another shy smile as he continued to help her through the dance. \"Give it a little more!\" She obeyed his request and before she knew it, she was dancing just as wildly as the other couples. And for the first time in who knows how long, Anna was laughing. Her smile, her real smile, was a thousand times better than Thomas had imagined, and it took years off her young face. Before long, Anna found herself yearning for sleep. She had danced for hours and was absolutely exhausted. \"Thank you for an amazing night,\" Anna said to the boy she had danced with all night. \"I guess I should be getting back home.\" \"I'll walk you,\" Thomas said. \"Oh, no, that's okay. My friend Elaine and I are walking back together.\" \"If I saw correctly, your friend Elaine left earlier with Vincent.\" Sure enough, when Anna looked around, Elaine was not in sight. \"I'll kill her,\" she mumbled. Thomas laughed. \"No worries. She asked me earlier if I would take you home.\" Anna shook her head and allowed Thomas to escort her back to her house. \"So, uh, you come to the Bismarck often?\" Thomas asked, making conversation. \"No, that was my first time. Elaine forced me to go tonight. I haven't been exactly…open to company as of late.\" \"Oh? How come?\" \"It's…complicated,\" was all Anna said. \"Well, you're certainly a fast learner. I've never seen someone pick up something as difficult as swing so fast. If you keep dancing like that, you'll be a natural in no time.\" Anna giggled as she felt a blush crawl up to her face. \"Thanks. I had a good teacher.\" \"Aw, shucks!\" Anna laughed harder at his words. By that time, they reached Anna's front door. \"Thanks for walking me.\" \"Anything to help such a fine lady like yourself,\" Thomas said with a small bow. Anna giggled again. \"I didn't catch your name.\" \"Thomas. Thomas Berger.\" \"Lovely to meet you, Thomas Berger. I'm Anna Hensley.\" \"Pleasure, Miss Hensley.\" While Anna walked through school the next day, Thomas came up to her and fell into step beside her. \"Hey, Anna. You, me, Bismarck tomorrow night.\" \"Nice to see you too,\" Anna laughed. \"I don't know if my father will let me.\" \"He let you last night.\" \"He wasn't exactly…up for not letting me go. And besides it was Elaine who convinced me and ever since she met Vincent, I can't get three words out of her.\" \"I'll pick you up at your house at 6:30.\" Thomas walked away from her despite her protests echoing behind him. Sure enough, the next night at almost exactly 6:30, Thomas showed up at Anna's front door. She had decided to don a slimming turquoise dress that she could dance in. \"My lady,\" Thomas said offering her his arm. She giggled as she gingerly took it and they walked to the Bismarck together. Once there, Thomas found his usual crew and walked her over to them. \"Hey, fellas! There's someone I want you to meet!\" All the boys at the table looked at her and she felt quite small under their gazes. \"Anna, this is Otto and Arvid. They make some of the best music in the country. And this here is my partner in crime, Peter Müller,\" he introduced as he slung his arm around Peter's shoulders. \"And gents, this here is Miss Anna Hensley.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" Anna said shyly. Anna was never really good at meeting people. Her brother had been the one to help her get acquainted with friends and ever since his death, she found it harder and harder to make new ones. \"So you're the girl who caught his eye,\" Peter laughed. Anna's face turned a very beet red at his words and Thomas proceeded to hit his friend on the back of the head. \"It takes a lot for Thomas to actually like like a girl,\" Arvid added. \"You must really be something else.\" \"He certainly picked a winner! You're gorgeous!\" Otto exclaimed. Anna blushed again at all of their words, and let out a small laugh. \"Come on, Anna,\" Thomas said. \"Let's dance.\" Anna giggled again as he led her once more out onto the dance floor. He showed her some new steps and once again, she picked them up fairly easily. It was even better than the first time she had gone dancing. \"Hey, Peter!\" Thomas called. \"Let's show her what we got!\" Peter and Thomas went out to the middle of the floor and started doing a dance together that they must have rehearsed several times over. Anna couldn't help but smile at their obvious friendship. It reminded her a lot of what she used to have with her brother. Thomas broke off the dance and grabbed Anna and began to dance with her again while Peter grabbed a girl from the audience. All four of them began swing dancing wildly, and Anna completely forgot that she was supposed to be shy.[Chapter 2] \"What do you say we go out for lunch Saturday?\" Thomas asked her at school. Anna blushed. \"Why do you keep asking me places?\" \"You're a pretty girl. Just can't help myself.\" She sighed. \"Alright, fine, I will let you take me out to lunch.\" \"See ya then!\" he said as he bounded off. Anna let a small laugh escape from her lips. Suddenly, she felt herself whirled around and came face-to-face with Elaine. \"What were you doing talking to Thomas Berger?\" she squealed. \"Hello to you too,\" Anna laughed. \"He wants to take me out to lunch this weekend.\" \"You mean to tell me that you caught Thomas Berger's eye?\" \"You were there when he asked me to dance!\" \"Well, yeah, but Thomas always asks different girls to dance. It's something huge when he keeps talking to them outside of the Bismarck!\" \"We went dancing again the other day. I met all of his friends. They were really nice too.\" \"He introduced you to his posse? Do you realize how serious this is?\" \"Um…no…\" \"If he's asking you to go dancing with him and to lunch, then he's interested in you. Trust me.\" Elaine squealed again. \"I'm so happy for you! See, aren't you glad I took you out of your house last week?\" \"Sort of. You did end up ditching me for Vincent.\" \"Psh, I only did that because I saw how happy you were with Thomas. You deserved to be happy and so I let him take you home so you could spend more time with him. I mean, I hadn't seen you smile like that in a really long time. It was nice to see you in such high spirits again.\" Anna realized that Elaine was right. That first night with Thomas had been the first time since her brother's death that she didn't hate her life. And now with him continually flirting with her, it seemed like it was only going to go uphill. Lunch with Thomas proved to be almost as fun as going dancing with him. He made her laugh on more than one occasion until her stomach hurt and she couldn't eat anymore. He then took her to Arvid's apartment, where apparently all the guys got together all the time. All the boys were happy to see her again. \"Hey, Anna!\" Arvid said. \"Can you name this hit?\" Anna blushed a little and refused to meet anyone's eyes. \"No…I can't.\" \"That's okay,\" Peter said quickly. \"Everyone's gotta start somewhere!\" She smiled at his attempts to help her feel less intimidated. Arvid shared some records with her, and they all \"tutored\" her in swing music. \"The best hits are by Benny Goodman,\" Arvid explained. \"Coming in next is Django Reinhardt. And of course, you can't beat Duke Ellington.\" He played a couple of songs on his guitar for her, and Anna watched his fingers move from chord to chord at a dizzying speed. It was fascinating to watch him play so effortlessly. She was pretty uncomfortable at first, but after a while, she began to warm up to their kindness towards her. \"Okay, Anna,\" Arvid said after nearly three weeks of teaching her swing music. \"Recognize this one?\" He put a record on the player and let the music flow around them. \"Um,\" Anna said as she listened to it. \"Is it…'Don't Be That Way'?\" \"By?\" \"Um…Benny…Goodman?\" All the boys cheered at her correct answer. \"We'll make a hepcat out of you yet!\" Peter praised. Anna laughed at her newfound friends. It had been a while since she had been this happy. Thomas began bringing her with him on all his outings with his friends, and she sort of indirectly became one of them. As time went on, her shyness got less and less prominent. She felt comfortable with the boys and formed a good relationship with all of them, especially Peter. She found that he was sort of filling the missing hole her brother had left. She could always find solace in Peter when she had a rough day. Most of the time, she went to Thomas, but there were times when she wanted to talk to Peter and receive more unbiased advice and comfort. It did not escape Peter and Thomas's notice that she was slowly coming out of the shell she had secluded herself into. She smiled a lot more than she used to and laughed a lot more as well. It seemed like a two-ton weight had been lifted off her shoulders, and she was now free to be herself. \"Anna!\" Peter called. He fell into step beside her. \"My mother insists on having you over for dinner tonight. She wants to meet the girl who has charmed over Thomas's heart.\" Anna let out a small laugh. \"I'd be happy to. From what you've told me, she sounds like a very nice woman.\" That night, Anna showed up in a casual dress in order to appear presentable. She lightly knocked on the door, hoping she didn't look as nervous as she felt. \"Oh, you must be Anna,\" the woman who answered the door said with a smile. \"Peter's talked so much about you. Please, come in.\" Anna smiled and stepped inside the door. She liked this woman. \"I'm Peter's mother. And this is my other son, Willi.\" \"Hi!\" the little boy next to her said happily. Anna politely shook his hand and then they all sat down to eat at the table. \"Thank you for agreeing to eat with us,\" his mother said as she passed around the dishes. \"It's so nice to have good company.\" \"Thank you for the invitation. I haven't had dinner outside of my house in quite a long time.\" For a good bit of time, Peter's mother politely asked questions about Anna's life, and she told as much as she allowed herself to. Peter and Willi were as talkative as ever, and Anna had never felt so at home. Because Anna had had dinner at Peter's house, Thomas felt compelled for her to eat over at his own house. So sure enough, Anna found herself sitting to dinner with Thomas's family. Although she really cared for Thomas, his family was another matter. She loved his mother, but she could not say the same for his father. The entire time she ate, she felt like the man was judging her, like she wasn't good enough for his son. Or she was too good for him. It was clear Thomas noticed she felt rather uncomfortable because the second he could, he stood up and offered to escort her home. \"I'm sorry,\" he apologized as they walked down the sidewalk. \"I should've known that dinner with my folks wouldn't be as good as with Peter's mom.\" Anna smiled at him pitifully. \"It wasn't too bad.\" \"No need to try to make me feel better. I know it wasn't good. My father never really thought I would ever follow in his footsteps. He hates swing more than anything, and is about ready to disown me for going to all those parties.\" \"Well, your mother was very sweet.\" Thomas laughed. \"Moms usually are.\" They made it to her door and said their good-byes. Before he left, Thomas placed a soft kiss to her cheek. Anna's face turned beet red as she walked inside the door to her home.[Chapter 3] After a time, Anna felt comfortable enough to tell Peter and Thomas what happened with her brother and mother. Tears were shed by Anna as the loss was still quite fresh in her mind, but both of the boys were there to comfort her, and felt honored that she was willing to tell them her story. Thomas had a bit of a temper and Anna quickly learned how to control it. He never lost it with her, but every now and again, she had to calm him down when he got frustrated with other people. There was a day when Anna reflected on who she had become since she met Thomas. She was no longer that depressed little girl who didn't talk to anyone. When she looked in the mirror, she didn't recognize the girl staring back at her. In fact, every day now, she surprised herself when she saw how bold she had gotten. It was a nice change and she had Elaine and Thomas to thank for it. She and Thomas ended up going to the Bismarck together every chance they got. It was true they fancied each other, but neither was willing to make the first move to make them official. She walked up to her group of boys at school and they quickly put away some pictures they had in their hands. \"What were those?\" she asked. \"Uh, nothing,\" Peter said quickly. She let it go because honestly, she had a feeling she really didn't want to know what they were. \"Ooh, look what we have here!\" Thomas said. They all turned to find Peter's love interest, Evey, about to head out with some of her other girlfriends. \"Have you talked with her yet?\" \"Who says I'm interested?\" Peter answered. \"Your tongue was on the floor.\" As the girls walked by, Thomas called out, \"Didn't we see you pigeons at the Café Bismarck the other night?\" \"We wouldn't be caught dead there,\" Evey answered sharply. \"Especially not with you, Thomas Berger,\" her friend said. \"Oh?\" Anna said with anger in her voice. \"And what's so wrong with Thomas Berger?\" Thomas pulled her back gently with a smirk on his face. \"Hey, now it's alright, baby. Not everyone loves me as much as you do.\" She gave him a playful smirk back and they followed the other girls out. \"What's so great about it?\" Evey asked. \"Well, it was the swingiest party ever, right, Anna?\" \"Swingiest!\" \"Super-mergentroid!\" Peter added. \"Super what?\" Evey asked. \"Come on, Evey! They talk gibberish!\" Evey's other friend said. \"No, it's a secret language we're not allowed to know. It's all too secret.\" They began to walk away before Peter shouted, \"You!\" The group turned to look at him and Peter started singing, \"Go to my head,\" then the rest of the group, including Anna, joined in with him, \"and you linger like a haunting refrain! And I find you spinnin' round in my brain!\" Thomas took Anna and spun her in a little circle to suit the lyrics. She laughed and playfully pushed him away from her. It was another night when Thomas so graciously escorted Anna to another dance at the Bismarck. They watched in awe as Arvid gracefully played the guitar in a certain way that no one could ever hope to copy. The people formed a circle and different couples went to the center to show off their dancing skills. Anna was not surprised when Thomas and Peter decided to go into the middle together and start dancing wildly. Halfway through their dance, Thomas grabbed Anna and pulled her into the center with them. The two boys flung her around as she laughed and danced with them. Suddenly, the music changed from a classy swing to a boring polka. Some of the HJ had decided to crash their party. Thomas took Anna's hand and they all went over to sit at a table together, none of them having any interest in doing a polka. \"Murderistic, Herr Hitman!\" Thomas said to Arvid as they all took their seats. \"Thanks,\" Arvid muttered, obviously not happy about his song being interrupted. \"Look at those pansies,\" Thomas remarked as he looked at the HJ's. \"They're all training for the Gestapo,\" Peter said. \"How'd they know we were going to be here tonight?\" Arvid asked. \"Probably beat it out of some swing kid,\" Thomas answered angrily. \"That's Emil!\" Peter exclaimed. \"Where?\" Otto asked. The group looked at the line of boys and sure enough, there was their old swing friend. \"So it's true!\" Thomas said. \"He was probably forced into it,\" Arvid said in an attempt to help their friend. \"It is compulsory after all.\" \"Oh, some excuse. Those creeps are too busy marching up and down all night to keep track.\" \"Arvid's right,\" Peter agreed. \"Emil couldn't be a traitor. He was the original hepcat!\" \"No,\" Arvid muttered. \"No one who likes swing can become a Nazi.\" Thomas made some mocking marching movements as he stuck his tongue out which made Anna laugh so hard, she had tears in her eyes and her stomach cramped. \"Aw, who needs him anyway?\" Thomas said as the HJ's departed. \"Come on, let's have some fun.\" He took Anna's hand and pulled her back up onto the dance floor as the music changed back to swing since the HJs had left. Though she enjoyed the dance like always, she couldn't get the picture of Emil in an HJ uniform out of her head. After hours more of vigorous dancing, Anna felt like she was going to collapse. Thomas once again offered to walk her home, if anything to make sure she didn't pass out on the way because she looked exhausted. It didn't take Thomas long to see that Anna was walking rather slowly. At the rate she was going, they wouldn't make it home for another thirty minutes. So he scooped her up in his arms and began to carry her down the sidewalk. She wanted to protest, but she was so tired, she couldn't do or say anything. Her head slumped against his shoulder as she relaxed in his arms. In fact, she was so content, she ended up falling asleep in his embrace. Thomas made it to her house and managed to open the door with Anna still in his arms. Luckily for him, her father was passed out on the couch from drinking too much again. He quietly carried her to her room and placed her down on the bed. She stirred a little bit but did not awake. Thomas chuckled lightly at the beautiful girl. Even in her sleep, she was utterly gorgeous. He placed a small kiss on her forehead. \"Good night, Miss Hensley. Thanks for another incredible evening of dancing.\" He closed her door and snuck back out. On the walk back to his own home, he felt lighter than air as if nothing could bring him down. There was a spring in his step that he had never had before.[Chapter 4] The next day, the whole group was gathered at Arvid's house for a little game. They would put on a record and then Arvid would guess what song it was and every technical fact associated with it. \"Keep the blindfold on!\" Otto ordered. \"Blindfold's on!\" Arvid answered. Otto played the record and Arvid scoffed. \"I'm sorry, Otto. I grooved this platter from the first lick. 'Harlem.' Recorded September 14th, 1937. Teddy Foster, trumpet. Freddy Gardner, alto—\" \"Hey!\" Peter interrupted running into the room. \"You guys are not gonna believe what just happened! This HJ rode by me and whistled the signal.\" \"What?\" Thomas asked disbelievingly. \"This HJ rode by me and whistled 'It Don't Mean a Thing'.\" \"You're joking,\" Otto said. \"He must've been a hepcat. It's like Herr Hitman said. A hepcat can't be broken.\" \"What if he learned it from Emil?\" Thomas asked. \"He might have been trying to trick you into telling him where the next party is.\" \"Come on,\" Arvid muttered. \"It took you a year to learn how to whistle that.\" \"Well, what's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means what it means.\" Anna rolled her eyes. These boys' banter was something else. \"Quiz time!\" Peter said. \"'Joint is jumping'.\" \"Um,\" Thomas laughed. \"What it isn't in here: lively!\" Thomas snatched the book from him as Peter smoked his cigarette. Anna had a mind to steal it from his mouth and stamp it on the ground. She had already made it clear to Thomas that she wouldn't put up with his smoking, but she had no power over the rest of them. \"Can't we find something more exciting to do? I say we go down to the red-light district, make some new friends.\" \"Yeah, I could go for some ladies!\" Otto said. \"Excuse me,\" Anna scoffed. \"Sitting right here!\" She felt rather offended that Thomas was willing to go somewhere to flirt with another woman. At the same time, she felt guilty for feeling that way because it wasn't like she and Thomas were actually a thing. All the boys laughed at her obvious discomfort. \"Those friends cost a lot of money,\" Arvid said. \"I was thinking of using that dough you've got stashed away,\" Thomas told him. \"No, no, no. I'm saving that money for the shortwave radio. I'm not spending that on some tart.\" \"That's because if you paid her, you couldn't get one to go with you.\" \"Okay, boys. Anna is feeling quite uncomfortable with this whole conversation,\" Anna muttered. \"Sorry,\" Thomas said. \"Yeah, you're real sorry!\" \"He's just bored because he doesn't have any idea which platters to pick,\" Arvid said. \"All right, put on that blindfold,\" Thomas ordered. \"What?\" \"Put it on.\" \"I say we go right into it. Come on. Come on, Thomas!\" He tied the blindfold over his eyes. \"Pick any record in the room. Any record.\" Thomas smiled and got up to go find a record to play. \"I believe I heard a little activity in the Gene Krupa section!\" Arvid laughed. \"It's too easy,\" Peter muttered as Thomas showed him the record he chose. Thomas went over to the record player and attempted to play it, but the room filled with an awful scratching sound. Arvid quickly took his blindfold off. \"I'm sorry, my hand slipped,\" Thomas apologized. \"You did that on purpose!\" Arvid shouted. \"I'm sorry, okay? I'll replace it.\" \"You will? From where? Alberti doesn't have anything left. I gotta go down to the docks. Besides, you have no idea what to look for!\" \"I'm sorry I'm not as smart as you! The only reason you know all these hits is because you can't dance to them!\" \"Thomas Berger!\" Anna yelled. Arvid looked at them all sharply before throwing the broken record on the ground, shattering it. \"Get out. Get out!\" \"Arvid, it was a mistake,\" Peter said. \"Accidents happen,\" Anna added. \"That doesn't mean I'll let him slide for what he just said. But his hand did slip.\" \"Why do you always have to go along with his stupid jokes?! Is it because you love him?!\" Anna blushed at his words, partially because what he said was kind of true, and partially because she hated it when people yelled at her. \"Well, don't get too attached because he'll just screw up everything like he always does.\" \"Arvid!\" Peter said admonishingly, knowing Anna had to have felt uncomfortable at his words. Everyone began shouting over one another for a couple minutes before Thomas grabbed Anna's hand and left the place with Peter. The three of them went down to the market to try to forget that experience. \"You shouldn't have said that thing about him not being able to dance, Thomas,\" Peter told him. \"Why not? It's true.\" \"That doesn't mean you have to say it,\" Anna said. \"He's got a hard enough time making it as it is. Do you think he wanted to be born a cripple? I'm pretty sure the answer is no. It's not his fault.\" \"I'm just sick of him acting like he's smarter than everybody else all the time!\" \"Well, he's probably sick of you acting like you're a better dancer than everybody else all the time.\" \"Ooh!\" Peter laughed. Thomas grabbed Anna from behind and secured her arms tightly to her sides. \"Take it back.\" \"No!\" she laughed. \"Take it back!\" \"Never!\" He finally released her and pulled her into a little side hug. \"Look at that,\" Peter muttered as a Nazi walked out of a bakery. \"They all think they can get away with whatever they want. He stole that radio from someone they arrested. I saw him give it to this tart.\" \"What if we lifted it?\" Thomas said. \"Next time he comes in for his hot loaves, he gets the cold shoulder instead.\" \"Yeah, we could give it to Arvid. Pick up Benny live.\" \"Can you imagine the look on that little creep's face when we walk in with it?\" \"What do we do?\" Thomas picked up a tomato from a little stand nearby and the next thing they knew, Anna was watching from the window as Thomas ran inside screaming, \"Fraulein. Fraulein. Help me, help me, I'm bleeding! A pack of HJ's stabbed me! Help me, I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding! I don't wanna die!\" He and the store clerk fell over into the closet while Anna laughed so hard, she couldn't breathe. Peter ran into the store to take the radio, but realized it was plugged into the wall and had to quickly unplug it. \"I'm bleeding so badly! Wait there! Wait, please! Don't leave me!\" Peter stole the radio, but not before the clerk noticed and ran out screaming. She let out a yelp when Thomas ran past her. The three of them started laughing…until the cops started chasing them. Thomas grabbed Anna's hand and they all took off as fast as they could down the street, trying to escape the cops. He knocked down as many objects as he could to try to delay them. Thomas managed to get him and Anna into a moving truck, but Peter was slowed by the weight of the radio. \"Come on, Peter!\" he shouted. \"Give us your hand! Come on, they're right behind you!\" Peter tried to run, but he slipped and the radio crashed to the ground and shattered. Peter got taken away from them before their very eyes. \"Peter!\" they both screamed as the truck carried them away. They got off the truck once they were far enough away and bolted to Peter's apartment. Thomas hurriedly knocked on the door and Peter's mother answered. \"Thomas, Anna,\" she said with a smile. Her smile faded as she saw the panicked faces both of them wore. \"What's wrong?\" The events that followed proved to be a whirlwind. But Anna was never prepared for what she saw that afternoon. She hadn't seen Thomas or Peter all day, and she was honestly really worried about the both of them ever since Peter had been captured and Thomas did not take it well at all. But then they came up to her as she walked out of school. And she couldn't believe her eyes. They were dressed in uniforms. HJ uniforms. Her mouth slightly dropped open, her mind willing the sight of them to just be a dream. \"Anna, wait,\" Peter said gently. \"Let us explain.\" She took a deep breath trying to prepare herself for what he was going to say. \"When I was caught yesterday, Herr Knopp bailed me out under the condition that I join the HJ. I didn't want to, but my mother convinced me after she reminded me of what happened with my father. I couldn't put my family through that again. And Thomas only joined to help me out and be there for me. I promise, we're not like the others.\" Anna took another deep breath, still disbelieving this was really happening. \"He's telling the truth, Anna,\" Thomas said. \"I joined so that we can infiltrate. Like spies! We'll lead double lives just like them. HJ by day, swing kids by night!\" She knew he was trying to lighten the mood, but it didn't work. Peter looked at the two of them. \"I'll leave you two to talk,\" he said as he walked away. Anna leaned against the wall and Thomas took both of her hands and locked their fingers together. \"I swear, I'm still the same old Thomas.\" Anna looked up into his eyes. She silently giggled to herself, now fully realizing that both of them had finally taken care of their long hair. \"Just…just promise me one thing,\" she said quietly. \"Anything.\" \"Promise you won't let all of this change you. That you'll still stay just the way you are.\" \"I promise.\" He leaned over and gave her a small kiss on the cheek. She smiled at him, but deep inside, she still felt unsure about all of this.[Chapter 5] Each day at the HJ, Peter and Thomas watched different videos about the Jews and learned from several officers how to fight and what to believe. They told their group what they saw, and it just made Anna all the more nervous. She didn't say it, but she was infuriated that they were being taught those horrible, untrue things. Several days later, they heard news from Helga… Everyone went to the hospital immediately when they received the horrid news that Arvid had been found unconscious, beaten, and bloodied on the side of the street. The first thing he saw when he awoke was the Nazi badges on Peter and Thomas's arms. Immediately, he began thrashing around in fear, but Helga, Peter, Thomas, and Anna all held his arms and managed to get him calmed down. \"It's okay!\" Helga said tenderly. \"It's just us, your friends!\" Anna told him. Arvid looked at all of them then at his bandaged hand. Apparently, he had broken two fingers…irreparably. \"He said I'd never play again,\" Arvid muttered as he took the bandages off. \"But he forgot about Django. Django Reinhardt played with two fingers. So can I. See?\" There was a disturbing slice along his two fingers that made Anna squirm. \"They look just like his. He didn't need these two fingers.\" \"Who did this to you?\" Thomas asked. \"Who said you'd never play again?\" Arvid looked up at them. \"…Emil.\" Anna thought she would explode with anger. She quickly left the room before she said or did anything she regretted. \"Anna!\" She turned around to find Thomas had followed her into the hallway. \"Are you alright?\" She looked at him with hard, steely eyes. \"I will be,\" she growled. \"If you swear to me that you will make him pay for what he's done.\" \"Meine Güte!\" Anna exclaimed when she Thomas that evening. \"What happened to you?!\" His face was all banged up, covered in bruises and cuts. \"Oh, you should've seen it, Anna!\" Peter said with overwhelming enthusiasm. \"It was incredible! Just wait, I'll tell you all about it when get to Arvid's!\" They all made it to Arvid's apartment and Peter began reenacting the fight between Thomas and Emil. \"Pow! Pow! Pow! Three to the stomach. Thomas won't go down. Tables turn. Right to the face! You have to see Emil!\" \"Emil's face looks like it's been bent sideways,\" Thomas said. \"You look pretty bad yourself,\" Otto said. \"It was murderistic!\" Peter said. \"I'm so sorry,\" Anna said. \"I feel like this is my fault. When I wanted you to pay him back, I didn't mean nearly killing yourself in the process.\" Anna took some medicine and tried to apply it to the numerous cuts and bruises on his face. \"Are you kidding?\" Thomas said. \"I'd do it all over again if I could.\" He winced as Anna hit an especially tender spot. \"Sorry,\" she muttered. Otto offered Peter a cigarette. \"Can't,\" Peter responded. \"They smell your breath.\" Anna smiled at him cheekily. \"Well at least you quitting will be one good thing that comes out of this whole mess.\" Peter gave her a small laugh, fully aware she had always disapproved of his smoking. Arvid chuckled. \"Maybe we shouldn't listen to this music. They might listen to your ears.\" Otto looked at Thomas. \"So what's the HJ like anyway?\" \"It's the stupidest thing ever,\" Peter groaned. \"All we do is memorize the Fuehrer's period of struggle and all this other stuff.\" \"That sounds awful,\" Anna said. \"It's almost as boring as it is here!\" Thomas remarked. Anna scoffed at him and gave him another one of her trademark looks that she gave him whenever he was too sarcastic for his own good. \"You don't have to be here,\" Arvid said as he grabbed his guitar. \"Don't you have some marching to do?\" \"Didn't wanna join. We had to.\" \" He had to. What's your excuse?\" \"Well, I'm his friend.\" \"So am I. You don't see me joining.\" \"No, they wouldn't accept you.\" \"Thomas,\" Anna said in her reprimanding voice that warned him when he was beginning to say things he shouldn't. Their conversation was interrupted by a knock on the door. \"Come!\" Arvid yelled. Helga came through the door. \"Arvid, you'll never guess what I found. I was over at Silka's house and—\" She stopped as she realized the two HJs and the HJ's sort-of-girlfriend were already in the room. \"Hi, Helga. Come on in,\" Arvid said. \"What's the matter? Everyone here looks sadder than a map.\" \"When did she become a member?\" Thomas asked. \"We can let HJs and Anna in, we can let her in,\" Arvid answered. \"He's got a point,\" Anna said to him. \"What is that? I went after Emil after what he did to you, and all the thanks I get is superior remarks?\" \"I never asked you to fight him!\" Arvid yelled. \"You're right!\" Anna said quickly. \"I did. So if anyone is going to be mad at anyone, you're going to be mad at me.\" \"Wait a second, Arvid,\" Peter said. \"Emil almost killed you.\" \"So we're even! Now we can all be friends! You're fitting right in: listening to the same songs, wearing the same clothes, getting into the same fights. It's almost like being a swing kid, isn't it? Though he never really liked the music to begin with, so I guess there's no difference.\" \"Thomas, don't you dare—\" Anna started. She was cut off as Thomas pushed her off him and threw a matchbox at his head. Then he stood up and they went for each other. Anna and Otto tried to pull Thomas off while Peter was in the middle and Helga got Arvid. When they pried the two boys apart, Thomas crashed down onto the sofa and Anna went back to nursing his wounds. \"What's the matter with you?\" Peter shouted. \"What do you want us to do, Arvid? He joined because of me. Because of me. If anyone's changed around here, it's you.\" \"No,\" Arvid said. \"No, I haven't changed.\" \"Yes, you have. You sit in here all day, you never go out with us anymore. There's a party at the Trichter tonight.\" \"Arvid?\" Otto said after a pause. \"No, we have to practice.\" Everyone looked at each other. Anna refused to say it out loud, but she was seeing a small change in Thomas too. And she didn't like the change that was happening. That night at the Trichter, Thomas, Anna, and Peter all walked into the place and were met with the glorious sight of a lot of swing dancers. \"Anna!\" Thomas said happily. \"Let's Jitterbug!\" He led her onto the dance floor and they quickly started doing one of Anna's favorite dances. \"Go, Thomas!\" Peter shouted. \"You're the King of Harlem!\" Anna could never stop laughing whenever she and Thomas danced together. It felt so natural. A swing line started and various couple went into the middle of the dance floor, Thomas and Anna included. Then they found themselves forming a circle around a new couple: Peter and Evey. The two of them did some very impressive twists, jumps, and flips. Anna couldn't help but smile since she knew Peter had a thing for Evey, and it was becoming increasingly clear that she also had a thing for him. Unfortunately, the party was crashed by some HJs. \"We are closing this club!\" someone shouted. \"You must leave immediately! You must give your names at the door! Leave immediately!\" Thomas and Anna quickly went next to Peter and Evey. \"If we get caught in here, we're dead!\" Peter said urgently. \"Come on, come on, out the back. The alley.\" Thomas grabbed Anna and the four of them made it out safely to the back alley and walked away from the horrid sight behind them. As time went on, Peter and Thomas began doing some physical training as part of their HJ duties. They relayed to her everything they did each day. Anna realized that Thomas and Emil were beginning to be close friends, and that really, really worried her. Did that mean that Thomas was going to be the next Emil? If so, she didn't know if she could spend time with Thomas anymore. Truth be told, she missed spending time with all of the boys and Helga. They rarely got together because Peter and Thomas were always busy training. She missed Arvid and Otto, and listening to Arvid play his guitar. Soon, Thomas proudly showed Anna a bike Emil gave him. Anna smiled, but Thomas saw right through her fake smile. After all, it was the first thing he had seen on her, so he could tell the difference between her real smile and her fake smile. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"I don't know, I guess…hearing about you getting close with Emil just…worries me.\" \"How come? I'm allowed to have other friends, right?\" \"Of course!\" she answered, choosing to ignore the tone he was using. \"It's just that I'm afraid he's rubbing off on you. And the next thing I know, I'm going to be hearing about you beating up some poor soul and leaving him on the street…like Emil did with Arvid.\" Thomas took her hand in his. \"Anna Hensley, you worry too much. I'm not going to beat up people like Emil did. Okay? Now what else is bugging you?\" She gave him a small smile. \"I miss our old group. You, me, Peter, Otto, Helga, and Arvid. We haven't gotten together in ages.\" \"You know Peter and I are busy. Besides, Arvid doesn't wanna see us. He's angry about us joining the HJ. You know, he just sees everything backwards.\" \"Or maybe he sees everything clearer than you do.\" \"Nah. He looks about things all wrong. It's people like Peter and I who change the world.\" Anna rolled her eyes, but she did end up giving him a real smile. He still had the same personality. But there was a difference. She just refused to fully admit it.[Chapter 6] After what seemed like far too long, the usual group headed over to a little café to hear some swing music. Unfortunately, there was no dancing much to everyone's dismay. Despite Arvid's injury, he still played the guitar with incredible skill. \"He's his old self again!\" Peter remarked. \"He's super-mergentroid!\" Helga said. \"But he still can't play ascending octaves.\" Everyone cheered as he and Otto and a couple other instrumentalists finished their song. Anna really wanted to start dancing, but she knew doing so would just get everyone in trouble. \"Hey, flyboy!\" Thomas said to the officers sitting at a nearby table. \"Get into any dogfights yet?\" \"No, but we'll get our chance soon enough,\" one answered. \"Can you imagine that? Up there just flying around?\" he said to his fellow companions. \"I'd get dizzy!\" Helga laughed. \"Peter, how about it?\" \"Wait a minute…\" Peter muttered. They looked to the stage and saw Arvid conversing with someone who must've worked at the place. The conversation got heated fast as Arvid stormed back to their table. \"Hey, what's the matter with you?\" the officer asked Arvid. \"We liked your music. We just wanted to hear one good German song.\" \"There are no more German songs,\" Arvid said sharply. \"Only Nazi songs!\" \"Let's just go, Arvid!\" Helga said quickly. \"Wait a second!\" the other officer ordered. \"You wanna hear a song for the fatherland?\" Arvid handed the man his guitar. \"Play it yourself. Take it. Take it!\" The officer hesitantly took the guitar from Arvid's hands. Arvid turned around to find the whole place staring at him. \"What's the matter with all of you? Can't you see what's happening? Are you afraid to look? We are murdering Austrians. Next it will be the Czechs, and then the Poles, not to mention the gypsies and the Jews! It's unmentionable! You think…that just because you're not doing it yourself that you're not a part of it? Well I'm sick and tired of doing my part! And now you want to hear a song. You need someone to lift your morale! Well, I won't! I won't.\" Arvid quickly grabbed his things and left the place as fast as he could. Helga, Peter, Evey, and Anna all went after him. \"Herr Hitman!\" Peter called. \"Wait up! Djangoman!\" \"Arvid! My name is Arvid! 'Djangoman,' 'Herr Hitman,' how could I have been such an idiot?\" \"What do you mean?\" Helga asked nicely. \"You've been practicing for tonight for weeks.\" \"He only wanted to hear one song,\" Peter said. \"It's not just one song or that song!\" Arvid cried. \"Don't you see? Anytime you go along with them, any time you try to help them, it just makes it easier.\" \"Arvid!\" Thomas's voice rang out. \"What is the matter with you?\" \"Thomas…\" Anna said in her warning voice. \"What was that speech all about, the Jews and the gypsies? What about the cripples and the retards? You know, that's who you belong with!\" \"Thomas!\" Anna shouted. Arvid looked at him hardly. \"I would rather belong to anyone, anyone, than belong to the Nazis like you do!\" \"Yeah, well, that's because you've got everything backwards. You always said I was the stupid one. Nazis go anywhere they want, do anything they please. Everybody gets out of our way! So who's the smart one, eh, Djangoman? You know, if I were you, I wouldn't worry about anybody but myself because we're coming after you next.\" \"Thomas…\" Anna said, feeling her heart break. \"Quiz time,\" Arvid said sharply. \"'Got your glasses on'.\" \"What?\" \"It means you don't know who your friends are.\" Arvid put on his hat and walked away with Helga. \"I can't believe I used to feel sorry for that traitor,\" Thomas said. \"Thomas. Berger,\" Anna said, trying to keep her anger in check. \"What the heck was that? Did you even hear yourself?\" \"What's gotten into you?\" Peter asked. \"What's gotten into me?\" Thomas asked astounded. \"Yes, you! What was that all about? Those things you were saying?\" \"I was saying?!\" \"I can't believe that was—You don't really believe all that propaganda, do you?\" \"Peter, he's the one who's got his head full of propaganda. Did you hear him? He was actually defending the Jews!\" Anna stared at the boy she once loved. He was no longer that boy. \"But Benny is Jewish.\" \"Yeah? And see what that music's done to Arvid? It's perverted his brain! Look at him!\" \"What? I can't believe this. Arvid's right about you.\" \"Oh, you always take his side.\" \"I'm not taking his side.\" \"You always take his side! Whether he's right or wrong, you always take his side!\" \"Well, he is right! Listen to yourself! You're turning into a freaking Nazi!\" \"Oh, so what if I am?! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I forgot. Your father was a Jew lover too, wasn't he?\" At that remark, the two boys began fighting right on the street and Evey and Anna were forced to try to pry them apart. They finally stopped and just stared at each other. Thomas scoffed and began to walk away. \"Come on, Anna.\" \"No,\" Anna said softly. Thomas halted and turned around. \"What?\" \"I don't even know you anymore. You…you yell at your friends, you defend people who aren't, you look for the bad in everyone, and you…you break your promises.\" \"What are you talking about? I haven't broken anything.\" A tear traveled down Anna's cheek. \"You broke your promise to me. You promised you wouldn't let joining the HJ change you. But you have.\" \"You don't know what you're talking about.\" \"Yes, I do. I've never seen you fight with Peter like that, or yell at Arvid like that. Or talk to me with the tone you're using now. And you told me that you would never be like Emil, yet you just threatened to beat up the very same person he did. You're not the same person you were before.\" Anna finally admitted the fact that Thomas was different. \"Maybe he'll come back. But he's not there now.\" Anna ran off before anyone could say anything to her. Once far enough away, she allowed several tears to trickle down her face at the realization that the Thomas that was there tonight was not the one she had fallen for. Anna decided to go see Arvid in the hopes that maybe she could talk to him and help him feel better, or sit with him and lament about the loss of the boy they once knew. \"Arvid?\" she called as she walked into his apartment. \"Hello?\" It was eerily silent in his place. There could almost always be a record playing in the background or the sound of him playing his guitar. It made her uncomfortable. Something was wrong. \"Arvid?\" She noticed the bathroom door was ever so slightly ajar. Knocking on it lightly, she called again, \"Arvid, are you in there?\" There was no response so she slowly walked in…and found a sight no person, let alone a girl, should ever have to see. There was Arvid lying in the bathtub with blood flowing down from his wrist into a huge puddle on the floor where a bloody shard of a broken record rested. Anna felt her stomach flop several times over and tried to back up, but ended up tripping and falling on the floor. She stayed there as her body wracked with sobs. She began screaming at the top of her lungs, but no one came to see why. \"Peter,\" she said in just barely a whisper. Anna got up and ran as fast she could to Peter's apartment, screaming his name all along the way. Once there, she rapidly knocked on the door until Peter answered. She flung herself into his arms and began sobbing all over again. \"Anna!\" Peter said urgently. \"What's wrong?\" Anna's words were drowned out by her strangled sobs. \"Anna, Anna, look at me.\" Peter took her head in his hands and gently forced her to look at him. \"Take a deep breath. What's wrong?\" \"It's…it's Arvid,\" she choked out. Peter's eyes widened as they both took off to Arvid's apartment. Anna refused to go into the bathroom again and could only watch as Peter laid eyes on the horrid scene before him. He slowly walked out and took Anna into his arms and they both sank down on to the ground in sobs. Peter slowly stood up after a time and went over to Arvid's bed. There sat several notes, each addressed to a member of the group. There was not one for Thomas. \"Anna,\" Peter said softly. She stood up and went over to him. He gave her the letter while he opened his. \"'Peter',\" he read, \"'I can't thank you enough for sticking up for me all the time. You may look like an HJ, but you never changed. You were the best friend I could ever ask for. But I can't sit by and watch the death and destruction around me. Because doing nothing is just as bad as doing the killing. So now, I'm leaving this place. Besides, Thomas was right. They were going to come after me, no doubt. I'll save them the trouble. Thanks for not being like the others. Arvid'.\" Anna opened her letter with trembling fingers, tears still pouring down her cheeks. \"'Anna, I know you loved Thomas, so I'm sorry for everything that's happened with him. Maybe you can be the one to bring him back. It sure isn't going to be me. Ever since I met you at the Bismarck, I saw a beauty in you that can never die. You're beautiful inside and out, no matter the circumstances. You are the sweetest thing I have ever met. Thanks for making my short life worth living. Never let that beauty die. Arvid'.\" Peter and Anna began crying once more at Arvid's sweet words to both of them. They took the other two letters addressed to Otto and Helga and delivered them. In Otto's letter, Arvid thanked him for making such good music with him. In Helga's, he confessed that he always loved her since the second he met her. It was a dark time for the once close-knit group. A dark time they weren't sure they could get out of.[Chapter 7] The funeral was a time full of despair. It was a beautiful service, but many, many tears were shed from all of those in attendance. Anna grasped onto Peter the entire time, and direly wondered where Thomas was. After the whole incident after what happened at the restaurant, she honestly wasn't surprised to not see him. Peter put his arm around her shoulders while Otto put his arm around Helga. Anna continued crying as she let Peter hold her. Arvid had been so sweet to her pretty much the whole time she had known him, not to mention the beautiful words he had left her in his letter, and she was still in disbelief that he was gone. \"Amen,\" the preacher finished his prayer over the coffin. When the crowd dispersed, Peter and Anna found that Thomas had been watching from a distance. The two boys looked at each other, and all Anna could see on Thomas's face was regret. Thomas took a step towards Peter, but Peter left before anything happened. \"Anna,\" Thomas said quietly. \"Look, I…\" Anna glared at him with tears still coming to her eyes. \"You pushed him over the edge.\" \"It's not my fault he went and did this,\" Thomas said, though his tone suggested he was still trying to convince himself of that. \"When you spoke to him last, you said terrible things to him. He was hanging onto this life by a thread, and you broke that thread by what you said to him.\" \"Anna, I…\" Anna walked away before anything worse came out of his or her mouth. Anna had been avoiding Thomas for quite a long time. Ever since Arvid's funeral, she couldn't bring herself to see him, afraid of what might come out of both of their mouths. Peter noticed that she was receding back into her shell. The weight that they had all worked so hard to lift off her shoulders was gradually being put back on. She looked and felt sad and angry quite often and he knew she was heading right back to where she had started. \"Anna!\" she heard. She turned to find Peter running towards her. \"I need you to do something for me,\" he said as he caught his breath. \"What is it?\" \"It's Thomas.\" At the mention of the boy's name, her eyes turned cold. \"Just hear me out,\" Peter continued. \"We had this talk last night at my house. It went south fast. You're right, he has changed. A lot. Do you think you could just…talk to him? Try to make him see sense?\" \"Thomas has a hard head.\" \"Yeah, I know. But he'll be more willing to listen to you than any of us. Will you just try to get through to him?\" Anna blew a puff of air through her cheeks. \"Listen, I've had a rough night. Herr Knopp won't stop flirting with my mother and he acts as if my father meant nothing to all of our family. It's infuriating. Believe me, I would talk to Thomas if I could, but right now, I need to do things for the HJ. Please?\" \"Fine,\" she agreed. Sure enough, that night, Anna went to Thomas's house. She knocked on the door, and his mother answered. \"Hello, Anna!\" she said with forced cheerfulness. Something had obviously happened to her. \"It's been a while since we've seen you here. Come on in.\" Anna stepped inside and his mother led her to the parlor. \"I came to see Thomas. Is he here?\" \"I figured you were. Yes, I'll go get him.\" She left Anna alone, and before long, Thomas came into the room. \"What are you doing here?\" Thomas asked. \"I just wanted to talk,\" she answered. \"No, you don't. You're only here because Peter sent you here.\" Anna scoffed. \"So now we can't even talk like civilized human beings?\" When he said nothing, she asked, \"What's wrong with your mother?\" \"The Gestapo came and took my father,\" Thomas answered without looking at her. \"Oh,\" Anna mumbled. \"I'm…I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not.\" Anna's head whipped over to him at his harsh words. \"What?\" \"He was putting down Hitler. It's people like him who are going to bring our country down. He needed to be stopped.\" \"Wait a second, did you…did you report him?\" \"…Yes, I did.\" Anna suddenly felt like she was going to fall over. She took a couple deep breaths and tried to continue, even though all she wanted was to just leave. \"But he was your father.\" \"He never liked me. He always told everyone that he believed I would never amount to anything. He didn't like you either, you know that!\" \"He's still your father. How could you report him?\" \"Because I have a duty to the HJ!\" he suddenly yelled at her, making her flinch. \"You just wouldn't understand.\" \"Thomas…what—what's happened to you?\" \"I finally realized where I belong and what I'm meant to do! I'm meant to get rid of all the Jews who are poisoning our country! You wouldn't know that, would you? After all, you're brother was a stupid Jew-lover and a Verräter !\" Anna gritted her teeth as she felt a rage build up inside her that she had never felt before. \"My brother,\" she growled, \"was better than all of the HJ, Gestapo, and Nazis combined. And as far as I'm concerned, you're no better than the people who killed him!\" And that's when Thomas did the unthinkable. He hit Anna firm on her cheek. She stumbled back in shock and tears began to form in her eyes. Thomas's eyes widened as he realized what he just did. \"Oh, jeez, Anna…\" \"If you could go back to that night at the Bismarck when you met me…would you do anything differently?\" Thomas just looked at her, still horrified at what he had done to the girl he had feelings for. He tried to come up with words but failed. \"That's what I thought,\" she mumbled before taking off outside the door. Once outside, she leaned against the door to his apartment and sank down against it as several tears fell from her eyes. Her body shook as she tried to come to terms with what had just happened with Thomas. On the other side of the door, Thomas sat in the same position, holding his head in his hands, willing himself to forget the past few minutes that had occurred. With red eyes, Anna knocked on the door to Peter's apartment. Once again, the mother answered. \"Anna,\" she said kindly, though Anna was glad to see she wasn't forcing cheerfulness like Thomas's mother had. One look at the girl in such a fragile state, and she asked, \"What's wrong?\" \"I need to see Peter,\" she sniffed. \"Okay, come on in.\" Once inside, she asked, \"Can I get you anything? Maybe some tea?\" \"Yes, that would be lovely, thank you.\" She handed her a small cup and Anna slowly sipped from it. \"Peter!\" his mother called. \"Anna's here to see you!\" Peter quickly appeared at the sound of Anna's name. His mother walked away to give them some privacy. \"I take it that it didn't go well…\" he mumbled. Anna shook her head. Before she could say anything else, Peter noticed something on her cheek. He went over to her and knelt down to look at it. \"Is…is that a bruise? How'd this happen?\" \"Thomas said terrible things about my brother. I got so angry and told him that he was no better than the people who killed him. And then he…he hit me.\" \"Anna, I'm so sorry. I'm the one who told you to see him. I should've known that he would use that against you. I'm going to kill him.\" \"Don't do anything rash, Peter,\" Anna said softly. \"Last time we did that, you were forced to join the HJ.\" Peter allowed himself a small laugh. \"That wasn't one of our better ideas.\" He looked at her and noticed that she looked like she was going to fall apart. \"Anna? I know you liked him, maybe even loved him, and he did too. This can't be easy for you.\" She looked over at him and her eyes became glassy with tears. Without a word, Peter took her up in his arms and allowed her to release her pent-up feelings about losing who she loved. \"Thomas!\" Peter shouted. Thomas turned to find a very angry Peter storming towards him. Without any hesitation, Peter punched Thomas in the face. \"What was that for?\" Thomas demanded. \"How does it feel?!\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about Anna! All she did was come to talk to you and you hit her! You hit her!\" Thomas's face hardened. \"I didn't mean to, honest. But she brought it on herself! She was defending the Jews and her Jew-loving brother!\" \"Oh, so it's her fault that her brother fell in love with a Jew?! No matter what, he was still family to her and she loved him with everything she had! And now he's gone and she's never going to see him again! You know, when she told you about him, you held her while she cried. The next thing I hear, you're hitting her for talking about him!\" \"We were taught to not hold back!\" \"You promised her that you wouldn't beat people up! And now you're beating up the very person you made that promise to!\" \"Just shut up, Peter! You don't understand anything about me and Anna! Nothing!\" Thomas bolted away before Peter could say anything more. That boy was not his best friend. That boy was an HJ.[Chapter 8] \"Anna! Anna!\" Peter said urgently as he knocked on her door. Anna opened the door to find Peter standing before her, looking quite haggard. \"Peter?\" \"Is anyone home?\" \"No, Dad's out drowning his sorrows in drink again. It's just me. Um, come in.\" Peter entered through her doorway and they sat down together in the living room. \"Is something wrong?\" \"Anna, I've…I've done something terrible.\" \"…What is it?\" \"I was assigned a special job by the head of the HJs. They told me to not answer any questions and just do as I was told. And that's exactly what I did. I went to the houses I was assigned and I gave them what they needed.\" Anna's breath hitched in her throat as she realized what he was getting to. \"At the second house, a girl saluted me. She must've been only ten or eleven. And she's already dedicating her life to Hitler. The mother took what I gave her and I walked away. Her…her screams are still echoing in my head.\" Tears formed in Anna's eyes. She could almost hear her own mother's screams as she received the awful box. \"I should've known, especially after what you told me. I decided to open the last box. Anna, what I saw inside was terrible, and it was then I realized just what has happened to Thomas and me. We've allowed ourselves to be tainted by the people we swore to never become. I just wanted to tell you that I'm…I'm so sorry…for turning into the person who delivered your brother to you.\" A few tears slipped down her cheeks. Peter stood up to leave. \"Peter, wait,\" she whispered, taking his arm and making him sit again. \"I want you to listen to me. After my brother was killed and my mother passed away, I hated my life. I just wanted to die, but I couldn't do that to my father. So I just forced myself to live day after day in a monotonous routine that seemed never-ending. I only left my house to go to school. While there, I didn't talk to anyone or even look at anyone. I just paid attention and did my studies like I was supposed to. \"And then Elaine forced me to come to the Bismarck, and that's when I met Thomas. That was the first night in months where I felt like I had…well, purpose. It was even better when I met all of you. Peter, you've become the brother to me that I lost. You've filled that missing part of me that he left behind when he was killed. I mean, you were there when I needed someone to talk to, you let me vent and cry, and you were always watching out for me. And for that, I'll never be able to thank you enough.\" Peter looked at her. He had never known that he had been such an important part of her life. \"I'm so sorry for everything. For me, for Thomas, for Arvid, for not being there as much as I should've, for letting our group fall apart, for…just everything.\" Anna walked up to him. \"I accept your apology.\" The two of them stood in the middle of the living room and shared a tight and tearful embrace, one they did not release from for a very, very long time. After the complete hell that surrounded them for the past few weeks, Peter offered to take Anna out dancing, something neither of them had done since they had had to escape from the Trichter. When he came to pick her up, she smiled at him. \"You're back to your old self,\" she said. \"So are you,\" he smiled back as he noticed he was wearing her usual dancing dress. They walked together to go to the Bismarck and when they walked in, it was a sorry sight. There were hardly any couples on the dance floor and the slowest song Anna had ever heard was playing. Peter took her hand and led her to the middle of the floor. They started doing a slow version of a swing dance together, unlike the boring dancing around them. The band seemed to notice Peter and Anna's dance and began to speed up and get a swingier beat. The singer's voice became bolder as more couples came out onto the floor to join them in the swing. Peter and Anna went all out. They both started dripping sweat but neither of them cared. They felt like it was making up for all the missed opportunities over the course of the last few weeks. For the first time in quite a while, Anna found herself laughing as they danced together. Their happy moment was abruptly stopped as HJs and other officers flooded through the doorways and began beating up every dancer in sight. One of them grabbed Anna, but Peter punched him away and put his arm around her protectively. Then Anna met eyes with the one person she never believed she would ever see: Thomas. He was with all the other HJs, beating up everyone in sight, an act he had told her he would never do and yet there he was. She made no attempt to hold back the tears that formed as their eyes met. Another officer grabbed Peter, but Peter shook him off. Thomas walked over to the two of them. \"Thomas,\" Peter said. Without warning, Thomas took his stick and tried to beat him up. \"Thomas!\" Anna screamed. \"Anna, run!\" Peter yelled at her. \"Get out of here now!\" Anna turned and ran out of the nearest door and it didn't take long for Peter and Thomas to come crashing out behind her and flip over the red car. Thomas hit Peter on the face with his stick and then pushed him onto the car where he proceeded to choke him with his stick. \"Thomas!\" Anna screamed trying to pull him off. \"Thomas, stop! He's your friend!\" For a split second, Thomas looked over at her, and Anna had never seen his eyes look at her that way the entire time she had known him. But then, it was almost like he became lucid, and he slowly took the stick away from Peter's throat. All three of them fell against the side of the car as Peter coughed and gasped for breath. \"Go on. Get out of here,\" Thomas said, shaking from all of the emotions he was feeling. \"You said they'd never split us apart,\" Peter said with blood trailing down his face. \"Peter, please!\" They watched as the HJs captured person after person on the streets. \"Go! Go on!\" \"And then what? HJ by day, swing kid by night?\" \"You don't understand. They'll send you to a work camp! They won't let it go this time!\" \"It doesn't matter. I know who my friends are. I'm not alone.\" \"Hey, there's a couple over there!\" someone yelled out. Peter quickly gave Anna a small kiss on the cheek for reassurance for the both of them. HJs ran over to them and grabbed Peter. Thomas roughly grabbed Anna by the arms. She looked at him with wide eyes. After everything that happened, he was going to be the one to turn her in and send her off to a work camp? \"You're not a murderer, Thomas,\" Peter said. \"You're not like them.\" \"Come on, swing kid,\" one of the HJs said. \"You got that one?\" he asked Thomas. Thomas just nodded his head without a word. The two HJs left with Peter in tow. Thomas turned to Anna and released her. \"Get out of here.\" \"What?\" \"Just go. Please, before they get you.\" Anna looked at him in shock. He was trying to save her? \"Thomas, I…\" He looked away from her and watched Peter get taken away. He watched as Herr Knopp talked to him with a look of disgust on his face. He watched as Peter sang 'It Don't Mean A Thing' as they took him away. He watched Peter's face as they met eyes. He watched the smile that formed when he was loaded into the wagon. \"Peter!\" Thomas called. He saluted his best friend. \"Swing Heil!\" Peter stood up in the wagon. \"Swing Heil!\" He continued watching as Willi ran after the truck as far as he could before shouting 'Swing Heil' over and over again. \"Thomas…\" he heard. He turned around to find Anna holding her stomach. When she moved her hands, he saw a gaping hole that was pouring blood. \"ANNA!\" Thomas screamed. He caught her as she sank down to the ground, holding her wound. \"Dang it, Anna, I told you to get out of here!\" \"I…I couldn't,\" she gasped. \"Why not?\" \"Because Thomas Berger, even though you have been a complete schwachkopf lately, I still love you. I'll always love you.\" Thomas's heart nearly stopped. It was the first time either of them had ever said those three magic words to the other. But why did she have to wait until now? He knew the answer to that already. He hadn't given her the chance. He'd pushed her away, and it was his own fault that he had never heard those sweet words. And now he would never hear them again after tonight. How could this have happened? \"Say it again.\" If he couldn't hear her say them for days to come, he would hear her say it now. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too, Anna Hensley,\" he whispered as he held the dying girl in his arms. Anna smiled. \"There's that boy who asked that shy little girl to dance. I knew he was in there somewhere.\" Tears formed in Thomas's eyes as he watched the light slowly begin to leave her own gorgeous eyes. \"He said I was going to 'wise up'.\" \"What?\" \"That day I fought Emil, he said he 'wised up' and that I would too, but I didn't listen to him. Turns out he was right. I 'wised up' in all the wrong ways. Anna, I'm so sorry for everything I've done. I'm sorry about Arvid, I'm sorry for what I said about your brother, I'm sorry about letting what we had fall apart, I'm sorry for breaking my promise, I'm sorry for not being there for you, and…I'm sorry for letting this happen.\" Tears streamed down Anna's cheeks at the utter pain she was experiencing from the stab wound an HJ had left her with. \"Please, Anna, just hang on.\" Anna gasped as a wave of pain hit her sharply. \"P-Peter?\" \"Going to a work camp. But he's alive. And he's a fighter so he's going to stay alive. I promise. And I'm not breaking this one.\" Anna gasped again. \"It hurts…It hurts so much…\" \"Just hold on. Please, Anna.\" \"Thomas…Swing Heil.\" \"…Swing Heil,\" Thomas said quietly. Anna's bloody hand went up to touch his cheek, tainting his white skin with her crimson blood, but he didn't care. She leaned her head up and placed her lips on his in their first, and last, kiss. Thomas kissed her back with everything he had, making every millisecond count. Suddenly, she went limp in his arms and the kiss was no longer being returned. \"No…no, Anna, please! I'm so sorry!\" Thomas sobbed like he never had before or would again as he held Anna close to him and cried over her lifeless body. He let his fingers intertwine in her beautiful soft hair and supported her head as it rested on his chest with his head pressed firmly against her, tears falling into her hair. \"Swing Heil,\" he whispered to her as he placed a kiss on her forehead. Thomas knew Anna always hated the Nazis, especially after her brother had been killed. And yet she still loved him after he had said and done terrible things, things he regretted then more than ever before. He angrily ripped off his Nazi badge that had defined him and allowed him to ruin his relationship with the beautiful girl he loved. From that moment forward, he promised to honor Anna's memory, no matter what it cost him. And he did not intend on breaking that promise for as long as he lived. He swore this on the life she had lived, however short it had been. He leaned over her, willing her to come back to him. \"I love you, Anna Hensley. Now and forever.\" ","Summary":" Life was tough in the 40's.

LOL. Please note that this story is (of course) a fan fiction and has to do only with the movie itself. I do weave in work camp details and the Nazi's cruelty, but do not have enough knowledge (as of right now) to write a perfect Historically accurate story. It is meant to be read for entertainment only. Rating:PG-13 for major angst and blood, medical issues ect. This is a hurt/comfort story. Thank You so much for viewing, and happy reading! Thomas Berger checked the dark midnight streets of Hamburg for any H.J Nazi's before he even thought of reviling what was in his car. A hidden fear filled his mind as he slowly, cautiously opened the passenger seat and peered in. There, his dear, best friend lay asleep and in dangerous health. \"Peter?\" he whispered tenderly. But the weak young man did not stir. Looking around once more, Thomas gently took Peter in his arms and carried him easily to the house behind them. The stirring aroused his friend and he groaned in protest. 'He's so light' Thomas dreaded inwardly. \"Hold on, Peter.\" he murmured Walking up the door, he knocked quietly; hoping that Evey would be home. Just then, someone came to the door and opened it cautiously. Thomas sighed in relief to see that it was indeed she. Her eyes widened at the sight of her long lost friend and a cry escaped her throat. \"Oh dear God!\" she quickly brought them into the warmth of the house. \"Is he alive?\" she sobbed and looked to Thomas through newly tear filled eyes. \"He needs a bed, now!\" the young man ordered. Evey ran up the stairs to her bedroom. \"Quickly, this way.\" she beckoned. Setting Peter on the bed, Thomas began unbuttoning his frail friend's shirt. \"Where's your mother?\" Thomas asked hurriedly. He almost lost it when he saw the damage done to Peter's body. Evey grabbed towels and medicine from the cabinet and came back to the bed. \"She's still at the clinic-\" She nearly dropped the supplies at seeing what was before her. Peter was covered in bruises and cuts, and he had received two black eyes. His stomach had caved in quite a bit and his rips were slightly beginning to protrude through his skin. Evey found herself starting to cry again as she watched Thomas tend to the beaten young man. \"Oh Peter..\" she whispered. A/N: Okay, This is just an introduction to my story. I promise to have longer chapters next. As soon as I get a review, Ill post the next chapter. In Chapter 2 we find out more about Peter and Thomas and how and why they came to be at Evey's. More drama and angst to come! Please review! ANYTHING!.lol flames accepted.[Chapter 2] Chaptern2:Enjoy and Happy Reading..Oh and I named Evey's mother Mrs.Ardin.nThey do not mention her last name in the movie. Notnone minute later, Evey heard her mother enter into the house.n\"Mother! Come quickly!\" Confused,nMrs. Ardin ran up the stairs and followed her daughters frantic call.nShe gasped as she saw the young man in such a horrible state. Hernnursing instincts kicked in she worked immediately. \"Whonis he?\" she cried, ripping out her stethoscope. \"It'snPeter, mother.\" Evey replied fearfully. Hernmother stopped working. \"What?nEvey, Tell me this is not the swing boy that was sent to work campnnot four months ago.\" Shenturned to look at Thomas, who stared quietly at the ground. \"Incould not leave him there…not like that…I never forgave the H.Jnfor taking my best friend away that night, yet here I am, standing innthis uniform. And like a coward I remained bound to their services.\"nhis voice became weak. \"When I saw him in that camp….\" \"Evey,ngo lock the doors, and bar the windows!\" Mrs. Ardin interjected.nShe felt the hairs on her neck rise at the thought of the Gestaponpolice finding a prisoner of a work camp in her house. Itndidn't matter now. It couldn't matter now. She had a patient tonattend to. A friend of her daughter's; in dire need. Comingnto her senses she made to attend to Peter. \"Thomas,nget a bath ready. Make it cold. We must get his fever down firstnthing.\" Eveynran back up the stairs in a flurry, worried immensely for her sicknfriend. Hernmother stopped her. \"Darling…waitnin the hall for a time. Peter is indecent at the moment.\" Eveynreluctantly obeyed, and she slowly leaned against the wall fornsupport. Thomasnlifted Peter's broken figure from the bed and carried him to thentub. \"Sorry,nbuddy.\" he whispered. Anwave of pity washed over Thomas as he gently laid his friend in thenicy water. Immediately,nPeter's eyes snapped open and he looked around in wild panic as hentried to figure out where he was. He cried out fearfully until henlocked his eyes in Thomas. \"Peter,nit's alright.\" his friend coaxed. \"We're trying to get yournfever down. I'll tell you everything later, Okay?…Just try andnrelax.\" Peter'snteeth chattered and his whole body erupted in shivers. Thomas feltnhis heart break as his ailing friend began to cry. \"Thomas…Don'tnleave me.\" Peter whimpered. \"Don't let them hurt me anymore. Thomasnimmediately knelt to his knees and wrapped his arms around his coldnand miserable friend. \"Hey.nHey. Come on now ,bud.\" he soothed. \"Look at me.\" ButnPeter could only stare down in fear and shame. \"Peter,nLook at me.\" Thomas tried again. Finally,nPeter's tortured doe-like eyes stared up at him: they were fillednwith distrust and sadness. Thomasngrew angered at the thought of some H.J. pansy leaving such bruisesnon his friends face. Then his heart grew even more angered in knowingnthat he had done the same thing months before. Henwiped the continuous tears that streamed down Peter's face. \"Nobody'sngoing to hurt you anymore. I won't let them.\" he promised. \"Okay?\" Peternnodded and cried pitifully against his friend's shoulder. \"Allnright ,Peter….everything's gonna be all right.\" Afterncleaning all the months and months of grime and blood from Peter'snbody and carefully tending to his dirt-caked hair, Mrs. Ardin hadnThomas place Peter back to the bed. \"Putnthese on him.\" she said softly, placing pajamas next to him. Thenformer swing boy had long since fallen asleep, yet he would soon benwoken again. \"Thomas,nwe need to get something down him quickly.\" Hearingnthis through the door, Evey went to prepare some broth. As she walkedntowards the kitchen, tears began to flood her vision. Peter hadnchanged so much. She had heard his terrified cries along with Thomas'nconsoling. A sudden flash of hatred struck her. What had they done tonhim. He seemed broken now, like a fragile doll dropped by a child…orna precious record of Django Reinhardt's shattered into pieces. Bynthe time the clock struck 11:00pm she was done, and brought the brothnto her room. \"Peternlet's get some food into you.\" Thomas suggested, as he proppednsome pillows behind his friends back. Peternmade eye contact with Evey for the first time in months. His palenlips opened slightly and tried to form her name but no sound couldnescape his weakened throat. Henfound he could only stare at her beauty. He had forgotten. The campnhad stripped him of everything, even his wonderful memories withnEvey. A/N:nOkay! So there's chapter 2. I know this one is short too, but Indecided to save a lot of stuff for chapter 3. The next chapter isnmainly based on Evey and Peter, but We do see a flashback of Thomasnand Peter in the work camp. I promise to make it longer! Pleasenreview. Sorry if it sucks. LOL Much more hurt/comfort to come. Hopenits not to sappy. ;)[Chapter 3] Well, Here's Chapter 3. I hope I get some more reviews. LOL . It's a shame that Swing Kids isn't very popular. Oh well. babe7878 ()-Special thanks to you for reviewing. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I hope you will read these next two chapters. There will be more to come. ) Angel of No Return- I'm so glad you liked it. Here's the next chappy On with the story! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Hello, Peter.\" Evey said timidly. Her hands clenched the tray with the bowl of broth. She wanted to hug him, hold him into an embrace in which she'd never let him go. But he was like porcelain; and the fear of breaking him was more overwhelming in her mind. \"I've missed y-you.\" Peter whispered hoarsely. Every word was torture to his throat, but he tried to ignore it. \"I've missed you, too.\" Evey moved closer to the bed and placed the tray on the nearby nightstand. Peter found he could barely keep his eyes open and he welcomed sleep, but someone wasn't allowing him to drift away. \"Peter, wake up, bud. C'mon you've got to eat something.\" He heard Thomas begging and coaxing him away from bliss. His brown eyes opened drowsily. \"No…too tired.\" he fussed in reply. He felt Evey sit gently on the bed. \"I'll help you.\" she tried, slightly afraid of his reaction. Peter didn't say anything but nodded slightly, not sure of what to expect. He watched as Evey brought a spoonful of broth to his lips. A blush raised to his cheeks as a short wave of helplessness passed over him; but it only lasted a moment, as his stomach screamed for the broth. He began to inhale each spoonful that was brought to him as his hunger brought no logic to his mind. \"Slowly, Peter.\" Evey warned. Soon, he had finished the entire bowl, but his belly still craved more. \"To much, to fast is dangerous in your condition, darling.\" Mrs.Ardin explained sympathetically. Peter nodded weakly; and instantly he understood why. His stomach churned wickedly and he groaned in pain as he felt disgusting bile rise to his mouth. Mrs. Ardin reacted quickly and grabbed the basin next to the bed. The distraught young man kept his mouth shut and his eyes watered due to the pain. \"Sweet, don't hold it in. Just let it all out.\" When Peter truly could not hold it in any longer, his entire body shook with heaves as all the contents of his soup were emptied from his starving belly. Evey rubbed his back as he choked and sputtered. \"I'm so sorry ,Peter.\" she cried, kissing his shoulder. Finally, the former swing kid could breathe again and he fell roughly back on the pillows as cool sweat dripped down his face and hair. \"I'm so tired.\" he said between exhausted gasps. Mrs. Ardin held a concerned expression on her brow, but she nodded and dabbed Peter's face with a washcloth, \"Rest now.\" she whispered. …………… After Peter fell asleep, Evey stared up at her mother. \"What do we do? He's so dehydrated!\" she questioned in worry. Mrs.Ardin could only rub her temples in thought. \"We need to hook him up to an I.V. of some kind.\" she replied. A long pause stood between them. \"I have a few supplies in my nursing bag.\" Evey nodded in understanding and helped her mother prepare for it. …………………… (A/N: I couldn't find much info on the history of I.V's. But I'm pretty sure that they had something like it. My apologies if any info is incorrect.)..sorry for interrupting. Continue! …………………… \"You think you're clever, Swing boy?\" A Nazi hovered over the bed when Peter awoke with a start. \"No.\" Peter whimpered, his own voice sounding pathetic in his ears. \"Go away.\" The Nazi laughed mockingly. \"Who's the pansy now?…You can't hide here.\" he moved closer to Peter threateningly. \"You can't hide from Hitler.\" Peter's heart pounded and he pushed himself against the headboard like a cornered animal. \"You're going to end up dead, just like your father.\" Peter covered his ears and cried out. All at once the reality and pain hit him full force. He thought of the endless beatings, the endless lifting and pulling that was forced during work. The starvation. The Nazi's laugh was sickening as he pulled out a gun from his pocket and aimed it at the former swing boy's head. \"Swing Heil.\" the Nazi mocked in enjoyment. \"Swing Heil!\" BANG! …………….. Peter sat up in horror and a hoarse cry escaped his throat. His eyes scanned the dark completely dark room. A thunder storm sounded outside the window and the rain fell hard against the roof. His breathing slowed slightly. It was a dream……wasn't it.? He sighed in puzzlement when he found an I.V hooked to his arm. Every part of his body was sore from his head to his- Peter's eyes widened, and panic flooded through him as he felt the wet sheets beneath his legs as realization hit him. What had he done? He was an adult. Evey…he wet himself in Evey's bed. He bolted off the soft blankets and nearly fell as he put his feet on the floor. Sheer will was the only thing keeping him from collapsing in a heap. He desperately tried to remove the sheets as he held in a scream. The pain to even hold himself up against the bed was nearly unbearable and dizziness overtook him as the room began to spin. He tried to ignore it all as he continued to rip and tug at the seemingly endless blankets and sheets. \"Peter!\" A soft gasp could be heard behind him as he nearly jumped out of his skin. His fear had come true as Evey walked up beside him. \"What on earth are you doing?\" she whispered loudly. \"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\" Peter cried. Tears of frustration began to fall down his face as he worked to clean up the bed. \"Peter..\"Evey tried, now fully understanding the issue. \"Peter, darling.\" But the young man did not even look at her as he continued to struggle in dismay. Finally Evey grabbed his hands and forced him to look at her. She felt sympathy course through her veins as she stared into his soft brown eyes-they were eyes that held secrets of an unknown torturous hell. \"It's okay.\" she whispered, stroking his sweat-soaked hair back behind his ear. Peter suddenly racked with sobs as he sank to the cold, wooden floor. Evey sat beside him and brought him into her arms. She slowly…shyly rested her chin on the top of his head and rocked him back and forth. She could feel his hot tears slide onto her neck as she felt her own fall from her saddened eyes. \"It's okay.\" ………………………. A.N: Okay so there's Chapter 3. Lots of angst in this one. Hope that's okay with my readers. I need more reviews! But thanks a lot for my few viewers that did. More to come! Thanks for reading. Doe's it suck? Review:)[Chapter 4] Many thanks to my reviewers and my apologies for the wait. I had a little problem starting this Chapter. Here it is. I'd like to remind my readers that the upcoming Chapter 5 is highly fictitious, as in yeah-right-that-would-never-happen-in-Germany-during-WWII- kind of fiction. But I believe it is good for the story. Okay enough of my blabbing. Happy Reading! And as always..review. ;) ………………………………... Evey quietly krept down the stairs after Peter fell asleep. She realized that she would need Thomas' help to lift him back on to the bed, along with helping her to get him cleaned up and dressed. As she reached the family room, she found him sleeping soundly, exhaustion obvious on his features. She hated to wake him, but there was nothing else to do. She neared him silently and shook him gently. Thomas' eyes fluttered open and he stared up at Evey in surprise. \"What is it?\" he stated, sitting up swiftly. Evey shushed him and patted his shoulder. \"I need your help…… Peter's fine, but, He had a little accident.\" she smiled sadly, feeling embarrassed for her helpless friend. Thomas shook his head in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" he replied. \"He had a nightmare and-\" \"Oh.\" Thomas rubbed his neck absently. \"Okay.\" They both headed back upstairs to Evey's bedroom. When Thomas saw his sleeping friend laying vulnerably on the floor, he felt another pang of sadness. \"Awe, buddy.\" he murmured, lifting him into his arms. \"I've changed the sheets….Here are his clothes.\" Evey stated, heading for the door. Thomas stopped her before she could leave. \"Evey, wait…I need your help.\" he stated quickly. Evey felt a hot blush rise to her cheeks. \"But Thomas…its not very prope-.\" \"Your mother isn't here right now and it'll be easier this way.\" Thomas interjected. He watched the young woman shyly sit down next to him and he smiled slightly. It was no wonder Peter fancied her. She was a bashful, sweet little thing. \"Just hold him up for me and I'll do the rest.\" he ordered gently. A long moment of utter silence possessed the room, and nothing could be heard, save the rain and the soft sound of removing Peter's garments. \"I was ordered to send a truckload of prisoners to a work camp.\" Evey nearly jumped when Thomas spoke again. \"By now I hated myself. I was just…just to pathetic to escape from this H.J. nightmare. I did anything they told me to do; but every time I had to beat somebody up or report an innocent child, I felt like I had done it to Peter.\" Thomas paused for a moment and he seemed to hesitate telling Evey anymore. \"We arrived at the work camp and unloaded the people…many of them woman and children.\" It was then ,as Thomas spoke, that Evey realized the pain that would come in telling her this story. She held a deep concern in her eyes, and prepared to listen to an emotional and terrible event. ………………………………... A/N: I'm terribly sorry to end it there, but I'm going on a vacation, and a youth summer camp for a week or so. I will not…I repeat WILL NOT forget this story. Times are just packed at the moment. I apologize. Just be patient and you'll get a nice long Chapter 5. Thank you and God bless![Chapter 5] Well! Here is Chapter 5! Hooray!.. I've actually gotten it done. Sorry about the wait. Okay ..remember, this is the unlikely and historically inaccurate chapter, so bare with me. Thanks SOOO much to my viewers as well. You are the reason I really wanna keep going…but honestly, how could I just leave Peter and the others to no conclusion, which by the way is not in sight yet. Haha Hey, besides reviewing, I'd like some input on what you guys would like to see, as in later chapters and such. I might just use some of your ideas……Thanks a TON! ………………………………... Chapter 5 The Nazi's pulled into the dreary and horrific work camp. Thomas swallowed the rising lump in his throat, as the familiar feeling of guilt and sadness poured through him. The people in the back of the truck cried out and hollered. Some in pain…some in desperation….others dying from weakness. As he stepped out of the vehicle, his boots were met with slippery, gritty mud. It covered and seeped over his ankles. He straightened, and appeared proud, though he could not feel any lower to himself. \"Unload the traitors!\" One man yelled. \"Sort them and get'em to work!\" Soldiers ran about here and there, and more trucks came, carrying hundreds of more people. The atmosphere was soon filled with terrible moans, cries and shouts. The entire area was chaos. Thomas surveyed his surroundings as he had many times. Taking in all of the despair and terror. His eyes caught a young man sprawled on the ground not thirty feet away from him… laying amongst other weak and dead bodies. The figures chest moved up and down, breathing as if it would be his last breath each time. Mud covered his entire body and he turned his head towards Thomas. Those eyes….he knew them. He'd seen them tear up in tragic times…he'd seen them filled with joy or amazement as well. His mouth stood agape and his whole body nearly went into shock. PETER! His mind silently cried and he clumsily, desperately ran for his friends broken form. He dropped to his knees in utter grief when he reached what he had feared would be his friend. \"Oh, God.\" he choked, tears immediately springing to his eyes as his lip quivered uncontrollably. He lifted Peter up in his arms and shook his head in disbelief. \"Peter…Pete. Can you here me?\" he whispered with a quiet cry. He brushed what he could of the mud , blood and snow off of Peter's face. Glazed Brown eyes stared up at him as his friend took large gulps of air. \"Tho-Thoma-\" \"You're okay. You're okay.\" Thomas comforted repeatedly. The smell of death and corpses made him want to retch. Peter clutched Thomas' cloak. \"Thomas. I'm gonna die.\" It was barely a whisper. Thomas clenched his jaw. \"No you're not! Do you hear me?\" he cried, squeezing his friend and shaking him. \"There's no sense talking that way.\" He felt tears drip down his nose and cheeks. At that moment, nothing mattered. The Nazi's could all rot ! The camp disappeared and the only thing he focused on was Peter's survival. Suddenly, a voice called his name from right behind. He whirled around in slight panic, to luckily see a friend he had met just weeks after Peter's capture. He too, did not like Hitler's policy and ran a long with it just like Thomas himself. \"Bryan?\" Thomas asked, as he bit back a sob. \"What are you doing, Thomas?\" Bryan whispered, staring down at Peter's near dead form. Thomas shook his head vigorously. \"I won't leave him again, Bryan.\" Bryan searched the area, afraid that they'd be caught to say the least. \"Thomas listen.\" he paused and crouched to his friend's level. \"You can't save him now-\" \"No!\" \"He's to far gone anyway…He's headed to the execution camp!\" \"STOP IT!\" \"You'll be shot down as soon as they see you with him.\" \"I DON'T CARE!\" Thomas' voice raised higher and higher in anger and sadness. \"Look,\" Bryan interjected. \"Thomas, there's no way out, and the others are going to get suspicious when they see you holding a prisoner!\" he continued to look around fearfully. Thomas knew that the young man was right, but he would not give up on his dear best friend that easily…not this time. He looked around and found a truck not two yards away, with nobody guarding it at the moment. Bryan saw the determination in his eyes, and he shook his head in doubt. \"Thomas, no. They'll catch you!\" he whispered loudly, his breath visible in the freezing air. \"I have to risk it, Bryan.\" Thomas interrupted. He took a hand out to shake his faithful companion's hand for what might be the last time ever. \"It's been a pleasure to know you.\" he stated softly. \"Cover me?\" Bryan nodded and the hair on his neck rose. \"Goodbye Thomas, and good luck.\" He watched in silence as Thomas picked up Peter as if he were carrying a bag of feathers. As Thomas crept around the buildings and obstacles towards the truck, he made a silent prayer, something he had not done since early childhood, that he and Peter could make it out safely. \"Hurts\" he heard Peter moan as they treaded through more mud and snow. Thomas nodded sympathetically. \"I know, bud.\" he comforted. \"You've got to hold on, okay?\" Thousands of thoughts ran through his mind. This was insane! He was insane. Peter…he'd do anything for him. That's why he was running for the truck. This was suicide. Doesn't matter now anyway. Got to get out of here, now! After what seemed like an eternity, Thomas reached the truck, hoping that the keys would be somewhere close. He gently placed Peter in the passenger seat and a sudden spark of relief hit him as he spied the keys still in the ignition. He aloud a tiny, joyful laugh escape him as he smiled down at Peter. \"Swing Heil.\" he laughed with a wide grin. He ran around to the other side and prepared to get in the truck, when he felt a cold, steel gun pressed against his back. \"Hello Thomas.\" he felt the Nazi's iced breath on his neck. \"The good news is that I'll kill you quickly…I'm afraid it will be a bit different for your traitor friend.\" Thomas watched in horror as another soldier reached in the truck and dragged out Peter's helpless and nearly unconscious form. \"You Bastard!\" he cried, getting the satisfaction of punching his captor. The Nazi aimed the gun straight to the back of his head. \"You can watch him die first!\" he spat angrily, motioning for the other man to pull out his gun. \"Kill him!\" Thomas felt himself scream from the depths of his soul, and new tears threatened to spring from his eyes. The bulky man that had Peter, aimed the gun straight at his forehead and a wicked smile came to his lips. BANG! A gun sounded, but the bulky man lay ashen on the ground in a pool of his on blood. And before Thomas knew what was happening, the man behind him lay dead as well as another shot was fired. Bryan stood shakily in front of him, still holding the gun in his hands. He lowered it slowly before completely dropping it into the snow. \"G-Go Thomas.\" he stated shakily. It was then that he heard a crowd of soldiers coming towards them. It began to snow heavily again, covering the crimson trails on the ground. \"Bryan…Come with us!\" he beckoned, picking up Peter once more in haste. Bryan shook his head. \"I've got it from here.\" he said confidently. \"Some men actually have a plan before they jump to any risky behavior.\" he smiled slightly, still obviously scarred by what he and just done. With one last glance, Thomas peeled out of the camp and somehow by the grace of God, made it past the gates. \"Thank you, Bryan…\"It was then that he realized he had not even personally thanked his heroic friend. ………………………………... \"Not even a thank you.\" Thomas said as he finished up his story. Evey felt her eyes burning with tears as the tale ended. She could not ever imagine the experience. She awkwardly hugged Thomas and held him in her embrace for a long moment before pulling away. \"I hope you will meet up with him again…I don't think he's dead, Thomas.\" she reassured. Thomas nodded tiredly. Peter now lay comfortably as possible in brand new sheets and a crisp, white nightshirt. \"We'd better get some rest, Thomas.\" Evey finally spoke after a long moment of silence. I'm gonna stay up here with him a little while longer.\" Thomas replied, rubbing the back of his neck. Evey nodded and shyly started to reluctantly leave the room. She stopped, paused and then turned around slightly. \"Might I stay with him as well, Thomas?. Just until mother gets home?\" Thomas smiled genuinely and chuckled. \"It is your room, isn't it?\" \"Well..yes..I suppose it is.\" Evey walked back towards the bed and the two fell asleep right next to their friend, hoping for the best. ………………………………... A/N: Okay I'm really scared for this Chapter, guys. Go easy on me. It's 2:00am! And I wanted to finish before camp. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Thanks sooo much MUCH MORE TO COME![Chapter 6] Okay friends! I'm back! At last! So sorry for the delay, but my muse was not at all active. So please enjoy this chapter. Many thanks to my reviewers with the ideas. I would be stuck without you. Enjoy! ………………………………... \"Evey Ardin!\" Evey bolted up from the bed in a flash. When she came in eye contact with her mother, she immediately remembered her situation. Thomas and Peter still lay fast asleep. \"Oh, Hello Mother.\" she stated as innocently as possible. \"I can explain!\" Mrs.Ardin gave her a stern look as she shook her head. \"Evey, we will discuss this downstairs.\" she stated quietly. As soon as they reached the first floor of the house, Evey knew she was going to get a fine lecture. Her Mother was a nice, kind woman; who, of course, could be fair and true. But anything involving young men was usually out of the question. \"I'm going to make this short and simple, Evey.\" Mrs.Ardin started. \"Sleeping between two young men is highly improper and unacceptable.\" Evey quickly interjected. \"But, Mother! I just wanted to stay with Peter a little while longer...and besides, I was not sleeping \"between\" them!\" Then, to Evey's surprise, her mother began to chuckle softly which turned into laughter. \"Oh, darling, how you remind me of myself so many years ago.\" Evey smiled slightly, wondering if she was still going to be lectured. \"When I first met your dear father-\" Suddenly, A loud, and harsh knock sounded violently through the House. Mrs.Ardin gasped in terror. \"Oh Heavens.\" she whispered. \"The Gestapo.\" Evey's eyes widened and her heart pounded fearfully. \"What do we do?\" Her mother pushed her towards the stairs. \"Hide them quick! Tell them to not make a sound.\" she ordered quietly. \"Hurry, I'll try to stall them.\" The knocking grew more forceful, as if the door would soon come off the hinges. Evey ran for her room in a flurry and slammed the door before her. \"Thomas, You've got to hide-\" Thomas didn't wait to hear the rest. He bolted to where Peter lay and threw back the blankets. \"There's a crawl space under the floor in my closet.\" Evey stammered, running to it and lifting up the floorboards. Peter drowsily opened his eyes as he felt Thomas lift him quickly from the bed. \"Thom-\" \"Peter, do not make a sound, okay. No matter what.\" Thomas ran to the dark safe haven under the house as Evey quickly laid a rug where they hid afterwards. Just than the door slammed open and four soldiers entered her room; all of them stern, tall and intimidating. Mrs. Ardin came close behind them up the stairs, fearing for her daughters life. \"I can assure you. We have no…traitors here.\" she cried. One soldier walked over to Evey and hovered over her threateningly. \"Is your dear mother telling the truth? Hmm?\" An evil grin passed his ugly features. Evey could only tremble and nod as she tried to calm her breathing. If Peter and Thomas were found out...If they searched long enough.. \"Well than. You won't mind if we search your house.\" ………………………………... A/N:Has a shield for protecting herself from angry viewers: Okay I Am soo sorry for not updating earlier. I have been going through an illness called ulcerative colitis (say that 10 times fast) and I've been really stressed out because it's a very painful disease that I've been dealing with for a few years now. It goes off and on from time to time...so that's why I haven't updated in a while. Anyways, I hope you guys are still out there some where. Please leave reviews! I love you all and will be updating much more frequently now. This chapter is very short and quick..and sucky. I realize this, but I felt like I needed something to bring everybody back in by leaving a cliffy that was short and to the point, and now the chapters should be a bit more..well..just better in general. More to come soon! Will Peter and Thomas be caught?…[Chapter 7] HOORAY! I have not died!. Though…I very well might now that I'm showing my sorry face here again. I Apologize profusely for my slow and horrible updates. :cowers in shame:..Its just well, to put it plainly…school sucks! Lol So finally Here is the next chapter. I am hoping to update much more frequently now that Winter Break is here. J Much love to my viewers.. Enjoy ………………………………... Banging and clattering could be heard above the crawl space and the two friends lay still in pure horror. Thomas tried to calm himself and his wounded companion. What if they take him away again? What if they hurt him…kill him right here in this house, before his eyes? Hours seemed to pass as the noise subsided and then nothing… Thomas looked over at Peter laying next to him. A little strip of light from the lamps above the floor lit his face slightly and he could see the sheer terror there. \"It's Okay, Peter\" he whispered. After waiting for more sounds and still nothing, Thomas sat up. \"I'm going to check and see if they've left…I've got to make sure Evey and Mrs. Ardin are safe, alright?\" Peter's eyes widened and he shook his head. \"No!\" he said a little to loudly. \"Thomas, no!\" Thomas laid a hand on his friends shoulder. \"I'll be right back okay? I'm certain they're gone.\" He smiled reassuringly. It was than that he noticed Peter's expression. He seemed to stare back in disbelief and then his eyes trailed down to the Nazi symbol on his uniform. \"Y-You told them to come!\" He whispered loudly and shakily. \"You told them I was here!\" Peter backed away from his supposed threat and ignored the searing pain from the movement, tears of utter sorrow filled his eyes. Suddenly, Thomas did something that he himself did not expect. He grabbed Peter, roughly, by the collar of his night shirt and glared madly into his face. \"The day they took you away…Peter…do you know what I did?!\" Thomas asked harshly. Peter stared back at him timidly, trying to swallow the lump in his throat. \" I decided that our buddy Arvid …did the right thing.\" Thomas felt his own emotions rising. It just wasn't fair; the fact that Peter was no longer the bold and determined man he once was….that because of himself…his best friend was now reduced to a fearful, child-like being. \"S-So don't you even think I'd consider betraying you again…that I ever met to hurt you in the first place.\" There was a dead silence and then Peter shook his head slowly. \"I-I didn't…I was just scared that-that..\" Thomas gave a sad small smile. \"I know ,bud.\" He interjected. \"You've been through a lot… Thomas stopped when Peter winced in pain. \"You've probably reopened some wounds. Mrs. Ardin can help-\" A loud creaking sound suddenly came from the floorboards. \"I think I found something!\" A rugged young man's voice could be heard. \"Oh my God.\" Thomas whispered in horror. \"Look…I've told you multiple times!\" They could hear Evey's voice starting to panic. \"Nobody is in my house! I do not …take in traitors.\" \"Well than young lady, we'll just check down here and than be off.\" a Nazi officer smiled. Thomas felt around for something...anything that could substitute as a weapon. He was not about to give up. He found a wrench and gripped it tightly in his grasp and than promptly pushed Peter behind him. The only thing between them and certain death were a few storage boxes filled with preservatives. Peter felt the hair rise on his back when he saw a flashlight hit the ground, threatening to hit his exposed self. Sweat dripped down Thomas' face, he stood waiting in anticipation and ready to attack, praying that he wouldn't need to. \"All clear!\" the man shouted. And than total darkness under the floor once more. A wave of relief filled Thomas' senses. He hugged Peter close and felt his friend weep quietly against him. Time passed slowly once more, and than Evey rushed to their hiding space in worry. \"Its okay, Peter…Thomas! Are you alright?\" Thomas carried Peter to the opening in the floor and they shakily came out. \"We're okay…Peter's opened up some wounds though.\" he replied. Peter felt sick as his head began to spin with all the adrenaline. \"I'm alright.\" Peter spoke hoarsely. Thomas walked him to the bed and Peter turned pale. \"I think… I have to-\" Evey reacted quickly and brought the basin up to Peter's face. After his nausea passed, he felt slightly calmer. Mrs. Ardin came swiftly through the bedroom door. \"Oh my goodness, are you three okay?\" She had been making sure that the soldiers were long gone before hand. She immediately turned her attention towards Peter, seeing that his wounds needed tending to. Evey squeezed his hand and kissed his cheek, smoothing back his hair as she did; causing Peter to blush more rosier than his fever. The room remained quiet, save the crackling of the fire. \"We can't stay here…\"Thomas suddenly spoke ,looking cautiously out the window. \" They'll be back.\" ………………………………... A/N: Okay Chapter 7 is up! I know its kind of quick..but I thought I'd better get some things going here, ya know? Does it suck? I need reviews. You guys rock![Chapter 8] A/N: I've been sick...and I just got married so sooooo sorry for the delay! Hope you enjoy this. More of a filler chapter so sorry it's short . Love you all…I'll probably be working on the next chapter tomorrow. Special thanks to Christine Writer for her comments and Inspiring story. ………………………………... \"Thomas, you cannot expect us to leave after Peter just re-opened his wounds! He'll die!\" Evey stated boldly, crossing over to the window to shut the curtains. Thomas turned his gaze to the wood floor and pretended to shuffle something with his boot. \" No.\" Thomas started with a long pause, causing Evey to sigh with relief. \"Peter and I have to go alone.\" The young woman could not believe her ears. Her head shot up angrily in Thomas' direction. \"Y-You can't! No!\" She shouted. Thomas moved to her now shaking form and placed his hands on her shoulders. His eyes, filled with sadness stared down into her hurt, confused face. \"It will be far to dangero-\" \"Suppose you go alone! Suppose you leave this fair young lady waiting for an eternity at her doorstep night and day. Who is to take care of him? When he is too weak to go on…when he can't take another step, will you know what to do?\" Evey's voice changed to a desperate, threatening tone. She suddenly remembered Peter's presence and turned to meet his gaze. Her heart broke when she saw the tears welling up in his eyes. He held out his bruised hand and she took it gently, kneeling at his bedside. \"Evey…Thomas is right. If something happened to you…\" Peter could barely finish his sentence before Evey wrapped her arms around him. \"I can't lose you again, Peter.\" She whispered in his ear. \"I would rather risk my own death.\" Mrs. Ardin remained silent during this conflict, feeling it was not her place. Thomas brushed his fingers through his hair and moved towards the door. \"We'll stay a while longer. You're right about Peter.\" He stated turning towards his best friend. \"You have to get a bit stronger buddy.\" Evey understood Thomas' urgency in getting away, but she was relieved to hear that Peter could recover a little more. Perhaps she could still persuade them to take her along. Sudden fears entered her mind. Visions of all of them dying at the hands of the Nazis. Bloody images of her beloved friend's death in the cold snow. She could do it. She would follow them. Fear would not stop her from protecting what was most precious to her. As Thomas and Mrs. Ardin left the room, Evey dimmed the lights and gently kissed Peter's forehead. \"Get some sleep, Peter.\" She murmured. The young man's battered eyes blinked heavily and then closed almost immediately, as if he had been waiting for permission to do so. His fragile frame finally relaxed and soon he was snoring softly. ………………………………... A/N: I'm ashamed at how short this chapter is…but I have a limited amount of time on the computer since I don't have one at home anymore. Please forgive me! Lol Does this stink worse than the last chappy. Im so nervous. Haven't posted a new chapter in years. Haha I will be posting the next chapter shortly. See you then. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Don't own \"Swing Kids\", but if I did, Robert Sean Leonard would be all mine. LOL.

Some things have changed, others have stayed the same and some have simply just been explained a bit better. After an unfortunate relapse in health (I'm feeling much better now) the story is back on track…expect the new chapter soon (I'm actually working on it right now as we speak). Enjoy the story!!! Pannychan Disclaimer: We own NOTHING!!!! We really wished we owned Peter and Thomas but that's what dreams are for. However, we do own Charlie and Lorelei. They are our own creations from our insane mind! Please let us know what you think of our new story, concerning the movie Swing Kids! It follows the movie timeline and will actually go past that and follow true History of WW2. Cause one of us actually happens to be a history major and I can finally put my homework and learning to good use. Slicked Up to the Nines Chapter One \"Ouch!\" Lorelei gasped as the paper sliced her finger. She had been wrapping books in the brown delivery paper for the past thirty minutes and that was her second paper cut. Who thought that working in her father's bookstore would be so dangerous?! Of course, it had been rather distracting these last month, making it harder to focus on the tasks Lorelei's father had entrusted her with at their antique and book store. \"Good morning, Lorelei.\" Peter Mueller grinned, leaning on the desk. Lorelei looked up surprised to see Peter standing there. She hadn't heard the bell ring, announcing that someone had entered. \"Hello Peter! I didn't know that you were coming in today.\" She grinned, the pain in her finger forgotten \"I figured you might be too busy lately, with all the fun you boys must be having?\" \"I told your father yesterday. I guess he didn't mention it.\" Peter shrugged; ignoring what he knew was an attempt to pry information from him. Regardless of that fact he really was looking for the owner of the store but it seemed like Herr Schumler was out. \"Are you running the store by yourself?\" \"No, my cousin is in the back. Dad had to run an errand but he should be back later this afternoon.\" Lorelei said finishing up the book she was working on. Peter nodded, unsure about how to continue. No one knew the exact details, but there was more than one reason as to why Lorelei had been so distant from the group. The recent death of one of their family members had hit them hard…and brought some new changes. One of these was the arrival of Herr Schumlers' newly orphaned niece. \"How have you been? None of us have seen you in a long time.\" He asked. The group had been worried about her since she stopped coming to the swing clubs and had been avoiding them at school. They had all tried to approach her at one point but she had made it clear that the subject would never be discussed. \"I'm fine, Peter.\" She sighed, knowing where the conversation was going. \"You don't need to worry about me. It's not like it was a serious relationship anyway…at least not to him.\" Ever since she found Thomas cheating on her a little over a month ago, she had avoided the whole group altogether. There was no way she would ever hang around the boys now. And even worse, so that Thomas himself would realize how much their breakup really hurt? There was no way she would ever admit to that. \"You should try talking to him.\" Peter suggested. In honest, Thomas had been trying to get in contact with Lorelei but she refused to see him. \"You dated for a year. I would call that pretty serious. Besides are you going to let a misunderstanding ruin it for you both?\" \"There's nothing to talk about.\" She stated, looking at Peter square in the eye. Just then a girl walked out from the back room, carrying a stack of books. \"He made it pretty clear as to what he thinks about our year together.\" \"These need to be sent out with the rest.\" Lorelei's cousin said setting them down next to the ones that had just been wrapped. Lorelei gave the new pile a dirty look. Sure she wanted to avoid the conversation about Thomas but not with more work. \"Charlie, I'd like you to meet Peter Mueller. Peter, this is my cousin Charlie.\" Lorelei said, introducing the two, as she started to wrap the new stack of books. \"It's nice to meet you.\" Charlie smiled, shaking Peter's hand. \"Likewise,\" Peter grinned. \"Charlie's a strange name for a girl.\" He remarked, but then mentally kicked himself for the insulting comment. \"It's short for Charlotte.\" Lorelei spoke up. \"But don't call her that!\" Charlie shot her a glare, which sent her back to wrapping the books so Peter could deliver them. \"Well I need to get back to work. It was nice to meet you.\" She said and went back to the back room where she was filling out the paperwork that her uncle had neglected to do earlier that morning. \"So how long is she staying with you?\" Peter asked, turning back to Lorelei. She immediately noticed how transfixed he seemed with her cousin. He was still staring towards the door despite the fact that she had already walked towards the back room and was no longer visible. \"Permanently, I suppose. She arrived from Munich last weekend. \"Her father\" She coughed before continuing \"my uncle was executed two months ago for helping some Jews escape the country.\" She replied. Charlie's father has been smuggling Jews across the borders into Switzerland but he was caught and was executed, leaving his daughter orphaned. After several weeks of being watched, she was finally allowed to move to Hamburg to live with her uncle and his family. \"I'm sorry Lor. We had no clue.\" \"It's alright Peter. It's not like I publicized it or put it in the newspaper. Thanks though.\" \"So are you going to be at the Café Bismarck on Saturday?\" Peter asked, quickly changing the topic. He could relate with Charlie's story, since his father was arrested for protesting the dismissal of the Jewish professors at the University. He wasn't executed but died shortly after being released from a work camp. \"It's not that I don't want to go, Peter...\" she sighed. \"Then why not? Is it Thomas?\" he asked. \"You don't have to talk to him, if you don't want to.\" \"I know.\" She said. And she did know that she could easily avoid talking to him but just seeing him hurt. Besides, Lorelei knew exactly where tonight would be headed. Either she would be subjected to seeing him with another girl or Thomas would stubbornly follow her around the Bismarck until she finally relented to hear his \"side\" of the story. \"Please come. You can bring Charlie with you too. It'll be fun. You need to get out, Lor.\" Lorelei studied him for a second then a grin slowly spread across her face. \"And what about your cousin? We could show her the sights and sounds of the city since she lives in Hamburg now. How does that sound?\" \"You like her, don't you?\" she guessed. \"You like Charlie!!\" \"I don't even know her.\" Peter denied, but in reality he found her to be very attractive. \"What about Evey? Have you finally given up on that snooty faust?\" Lorelei teased. Peter had had his eyes set on Evey for the past couple of months but never really made an attempt to go talk to her. This was fine by Lorelei because she couldn't stand the girl. Her and her friends always thought and acted like they were better then everyone else, especially the Swing Kids. \"There was nothing going on with Evey, you know that. She never gave me a second look.\" Peter shrugged. He wasn't that heartbroken over it. She just wasn't the girl he was meant to be with. What Peter needed was a girl who loved swing and was independent. As far as he knew, Evey wasn't like that. Her and her friends followed the crowd, conforming to societies standards. \"So now you set your sights on my cousin. Honestly, I think you would be good for her.\" Lorelei admitted. She could see the two of them together. Charlie was one of the most caring people she knew but she also stuck to her beliefs. \"We'll be there on Saturday but you make it known that I am not talking to him.\" \"Don't worry. I'll try and make sure he won't bother you.\" Peter assured her. \"Ok well you better get these delivered before father comes back.\" Lorelei said, handing him the stack of books. \"I'll see you on Saturday.\" She watched him head out and couldn't help but wish things were back like they used to be, with Thomas being her boyfriend and all of them hanging out at Arvid's hot club. But it's useless to dwell on the past. With that in mind, Lorelei headed into the back to tell Charlie of Saturday's plans and to find out what she though of Peter. Next Chapter : It's a reunion at the Bismarck! But how will it end up?[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: For disclaimer please look at chapter 1 \"I am so excited you came with me! We're going to have so much fun!\" Lorelei exclaimed as her and Charlie walked into the Bismarck. Her excitement over returning to the Bismarck replaced any odd feelings about seeing Thomas tonight. The music was blaring and the dance floor was crowded with people jumping and dancing all over the place. Charlie's jaw dropped at the sight of girl's being flipped and the couples doing all sorts of twists and turns. \"I can't do that.\" She stated, watching the crowd with wide eyes. Charlie was just a normal girl from Munich who enjoyed long walks and reading. At this moment she wondered, was this a good moment to tell Lorelei that she was a terrible dancer? Glancing over to her cousin, Charlie noticed that Lorelei strolled in as if she owned the Bismarck. Many glanced in her direction either admiringly or enviously but she didn't seem to notice or care. Lorelei was as graceful as Aunt Gretchen and as confident as Uncle Carl. And Charlie felt, especially standing next to Lor, that she lacked both of those things. \"It isn't as hard as it looks. All the girl has to do is follow.\" Lorelei explained, grabbing her cousin by the hand. \"Look there's Peter.\" She led the way through the crowd to the table where Peter was sitting with Arvid and Otto. \"You made it!\" Peter grinned as the girl's approached. \"Guys, this is Lorelei's cousin, Charlie. Charlie, this is Arvid and Otto.\" The boys greeted her and Lorelei plopped down in the seat between them. \"Strange name for a girl.\" Both Otto and Arvid were looking at her curiously, wondering where this cousin that no one knew about come from and why she had such a strange name. It felt odd knowing someone for over a year and just discovering something new about them. Then again, Lorelei Schumler had been missing in action for awhile now and her absence had been sorely missed by the both of them. Anything could've happened the last couple of weeks to have her cousin arrive and they were wondering what it was. Ignoring the look of death she knew would come soon Lorelei replied, \"Its short for Charlotte. Man I missed this place!\" she quickly added, looking around the room, spotting several familiar faces. \"It's about time you came back! It's been weeks since we've last seen you.\" Arvid said. \"Well you can thank Thomas for that.\" She replied curtly. Another reminder of Thomas Berger. Couldn't they leave the subject and anything close to it in the past? Maybe coming to the Bismarck wasn't such a good idea. But at least she could smile knowing that if Peter did his job and told Thomas to get lost, they wouldn't have to bump into each other. \"Thank me for what?\" Thomas asked coming up to the table. He had been out on the dance floor when the girl's had arrived. Lorelei's smiled faded away as she glared at her ex-boyfriend. \"Peter what did we talk about earlier?\" she asked, turning away from Thomas. \"Lor, maybe you should just talk to him. Either that or ignore him so we all can have a good time.\" Peter replied. He had told Thomas to stay away from Lorelei tonight but it was obvious that he wasn't going to listen. And honestly Peter wasn't planning on playing messenger boy tonight. If they wanted to talk or simply ignore each other it wasn't Peter's problem. He had other things on his mind tonight. \"It figures…\"Lorelei rolled her eyes as she got up from her seat \"You boys always stick together. I should've known better.\" Thomas moved to stop her from leaving \"Maybe when you stop being so stubborn you'll realize that you can't ignore me forever!\" \"Watch me.\" She said coldly and walked away from the table. Charlie frowned, worried about her cousin. \"Maybe I should go after her.\" It was the first word she had spoken since arriving and everyone suddenly remembered she had been there all along. And the fact that Lorelei just left without her. \"She'll be fine.\" Peter assured her \"Besides, trust me. You don't want to get involved.\" \"Why?\" \"Because we all know how this nights going to end.\" Arvid answered Charlie's question before Peter could. \"With a fight.\" The boys added in unison before continuing their conversation about the bands next performance. Charlie was shocked with their reaction. Apparently this was a normal occurrence. Lorelei didn't get far when another boy stopped her. \"Lorelei! Long time no see!\" he greeted giving her a quick hug. Knowing that Thomas was watching intently she kissed Roger on the cheek. Knowing how jealous he could be it would probably feel like he'd been stabbed in the heart. And that was exactly what she was aiming for. \"Hey Roger! How's it going?\" \"It's been good! So I hear that you're not Thomas' main queen anymore.\" He stated looking at the table she had previously been sitting in. Thomas had now taken her seat and stolen Otto's drink (which Otto himself didn't look too happy about) It was obvious that Roger had liked Lorelei for awhile now, ever since she first started coming to the swing club. But back then she had been Thomas' girl. \"Yeah but for the record, I was the one who broke up with him.\" Lorelei replied. She was surprised at how much it hurt to say those words, but quickly recovered. \"That's fine by me!\" Roger grinned. \"So you care to dance?\" Lorelei glanced over at the table and saw Thomas watching her intently. She could almost swear he looked as beat up over the end of their relationship as she did. Lorelei felt guilty for what was probably a second before remembering why they broke in the first place… \"I would love to.\" She grinned, taking his arm and heading out on the dance floor. Thomas continued to glare at them. Someone was going to get their face beat in tonight and everyone, including Charlie was sure of how the night would end…once again. \"Hey man, calm down.\" Peter said, placing a hand on Thomas' shoulder. \"She's just doing it to get you riled up.\" \"Well two can play that game.\" Thomas stated and grabbed some random girl from along side the dance floor. He made his way to where he was in Lorelei's line of vision. Lorelei was having fun dancing with Roger, but honestly he wasn't the best dancer. She was so used to dancing with Thomas that it was hard for her to dance with any of the other guys, being so used to his style of leading. As Roger spun her around, Lorelei caught sight of Thomas dancing with another girl. When he noticed that she was looking at him, Thomas sent her a smirk and pulled his partner in close for the Charleston. \"What is he doing?\" Lorelei gasped quietly. She couldn't help but be jealous that Thomas was dancing with another girl. As Roger spun her in, she stepped on his foot with her heels because she wasn't paying close enough attention. \"Oww!\" Roger gasped as he quickly stopped dancing. The heel had smashed right on the top of his foot, making it throb in pain. Mortified, Lorelei turned as she heard Thomas laughing. He had seen the entire thing and couldn't help but laugh. But unfortunately, he also wasn't paying close enough attention to his partner and when he went to flip her over, he ended up dropping her and she fell flat on her back to the floor. \"Classic, Thomas, classic!\" Lorelei laughed, clapping lightly. \"Well you're no better! You probably broke his foot with those damn heels of yours!\" Thomas argued back. Neither of them noticed when their partners hobbled off the dance floor. \"What are they doing?\" Charlie asked. She couldn't help but laugh at the spectacle that her cousin and Thomas were making. \"Making fools of themselves as always.\" Peter said. Whenever Thomas and Lorelei fought it was turned into a dramatic production. \"This is pretty normal for them\". \"So have you ever jitterbugged back in Munich?\" he asked, turning the conversation away from Lorelei and Thomas. \"No, some of my friends would go but I had to stay home to help my father.\" Charlie explained, hoping the subject would end there. Mentioning her father brought back memories of the last few months. Memories in which no matter how much or how often she'd try to forget, would always be there to torment her.\" \"Well it's easy. I can teach you.\" Peter offered. \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" She replied and indicated towards the dance floor. \"I can't do that.\" She was watching all the girl's being flipped around and could picture herself falling on her head…just like the poor girl dropped by Thomas. \"Don't worry. I won't let you fall.\" He said and dragged her out onto the floor. They spent the rest of the night with Peter teaching her the basic steps of swing. Charlie had even started to catch on towards the end which was a miracle. Peter was clearly one of the most patient and encouraging people she had ever met. It was surprising how comfortable it felt to be around…comfortable enough that time seemed to pass by quickly. \"Are you ready to go, Charlie?\" Lorelei asked, handing Charlie her wrap. \"Yeah we better get back before your parents get upset.\" She said. Aunt Gretchen and Uncle Carl were probably still waiting for them in the parlor to make sure the girls got home safe and weren't drunk (which apparently Lorelei had been grounded for a month for doing a while back). \"It wouldn't be safe for you two to walk home by yourselves. I'll go with you, if that's alright?\" Peter offered, putting his jacket on. \"Wouldn't that be out of your way?\" Charlie asked as they started heading towards the door. \"Not by much. We don't live very far from each other, actually.\" He replied, holding open the door for her and Lorelei. Lorelei couldn't help but think how cute they looked together. Peter was obviously interested but Charlie was much more difficult to read. Her cousin had been through so much pain and most of her quiet thoughts must have been with her father. But dating Peter might just be the thing that gets her out of her depression. Maybe she should investigate a little. \"Peter is such a great guy isn't he Charlie? And such a gentleman too.\" \"Umm…yes. And thank you by the way.\"Charlie smiled awkwardly as Lorelei skipped by them on purpose in order to leave them alone. Her matchmaking was so obvious and so embarrassing! They continued to walk mostly quiet but occasionally making a specific remark about the evening when Lorelei noticed that Thomas was tagging along behind them. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. Didn't the boy get a hint? It was bad enough having to see him at the Bismarck and now he had the nerve to follow her home? \"It's not like I'm in a hurry to go home.\" Thomas shrugged, swinging his umbrella around. \"Well don't you have something to visit?\" she retorted. \"You really know how to hold a grudge don't you? Especially when you don't have the full story. But if you just let me explain…\" \"I don't want to hear it. I know what I saw!\" She declared, quickening her pace and refusing, once again, to hear his explanations. \"Lorelei told me about your father. I'm sorry for what happened.\" Peter said after a short pause. Thomas and Lor wouldn't be much company now so he could talk to Charlie without having them interfere. \"We both understood the risk he was taking.\" Charlie said. It was still hard for her to deal with the fact that her father was gone but he did it defending a cause that both of them believed in. \"It's hard, I know. My father was arrested when I was young, for defending Jews at the university he worked at.\" Peter explained. \"They eventually let him out but he died soon after.\" \"I'm sorry, Peter.\" Charlie said. \"Charlie, come on!\" Lorelei said, walking up the front steps of the house. Neither Peter nor Charlie realized that they had already reached the house. \"I had fun tonight. Thank you.\" Charlie said, facing Peter. \"I'll see you in school on Montag, then.\" He replied. Charlie nodded and then followed Lorelei into the house. As soon as Lorelei walked in Thomas grabbed Charlie by the arm. \"I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to introduce myself. I'm Thomas; your cousin's good for nothing ex- boyfriend who didn't cheat on her.\" \"I'm Charlie. Your ex-girlfriends cousin who will now be living here permanently . I'm quite surprised though, she always spoke so nicely of you in her letters. But she's pretty sure she saw you with some other girl.\" \"Charlie please talk to her. Lor needs to hear the full story.\" \"I'll try. Goodnight Thomas. Goodnight Peter.\" She added before walking inside. \"Oooh I'll see you in school on Montag, Charlie!!! I love you so much!!! Oooh!!!\" Thomas said, making fun of Peter as they started making their way back up the street. \"Oh shut up.\" Peter said, punching him in the arm. \"You should worry about your own love life. Or lack of.\" Next Chapter: First day of school for Charlie!!! R&R;[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: \"Hey Peter, Thomas!\" Arvid called as the boys met up on the stairs. The last class of the day had just let out and the could finally relax and unwind at the hotclub after school.. \"Quiz time!\" he said, pulling out Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary. \"What is an icky?\" He looked up at the boys surrounding him, waiting for the answer. \"Someone who's stupid, not hip, can't collar that jive.\" Peter recited off and then asked, \"Jive?\" \"Ooh Talk! What they say in Harlem.\" Thomas chimed in and then grabbed the book from Arvid. \"Umm…faust?\" he asked, quickly picking one out from the page. \"Oh! A book by Goethe!\" Otto chimed in. The rest of the boys groaned and called him an \"icky\" for saying the wrong answer. There's always one friend you would call clueless: and in this case, it was Otto. \"Even as we speak two icky's.\" Peter laughed as they passed two boys on the stairwell. \"A faust is an ugly girl.\" Arvid said, rather smugly. He knew the entire Hepster's Dictionary like the back of his hand. \"Like that faust you went for at the Bismarck the other night.\" Thomas could never resist taking a crack at Arvid; he was just so easily offended. Before Arvid could reply back, Otto huddled them close. \"Boys, boys could you go for these?\" he asked, whipping out some pictures of topless girls. \"Ooh ooh I like these. Look at these breasts.\" Thomas grinned, peering over Otto's shoulder. \"Otto, where did you get these?\" Peter asked, curiously, taking one of the cards from the pile. \"I got em,\" he answered vaguely, as he flipped through the pictures, showing them to the boys. \"What do you call those? Cupcake size?\" Thomas interjected. He could care less where Otto got them from. \"Cantaloupe.\" One of the boys chimed in. Thomas laughed and glanced up seeing Charlie and Lorelei walk by. \"Oh look its Peter's duchess,\" he pointed out, teasingly. The girls had just gone to their lockers to get their jackets. Neither had noticed the boys watching them yet. \"Who says I'm interested?\" Peter retorted. Otto quickly slipped the cards back into his pocket knowing that the girls would never let him forget it if they saw them. \"Oh come on! You're tongue was hanging on the floor!\" Thomas declared and Peter just rolled his eyes. How ironic, seeing who Charlie's walking with. \"I can't believe that Fräulein Schneider is giving us a test already! We've barely covered all the material.\" Lorelei complained, tossing her books into the locker. \"She must think we're ready for it, if she is giving us the test so soon.\" Charlie shrugged, putting her books into her bag. \"Either that or she's just an evil witch!\" Lorelei said and Charlie just laughed. It was true that Fräulein Schneider was not a very pleasant woman and her tests were almost impossible to pass. \"Hey did you pigeons have fun at the Bismarck the other night?\" Thomas interjected as he approached the girls. \"Do you hear something because I sure don't?\" Lorelei said, looking at Charlie. \"Be nice.\" she replied, as she closed her locker \"He's trying to apologize.\" She looked up and caught Peter watching her and smiled at him. \"Damn it! Just listen to me for five seconds, will you?\" Thomas demanded, agitated. He was getting tired of the bickering and her not giving him a chance. \"Thomas, calm down.\" Peter said. He knew that both Lorelei and Thomas were hurting but they really needed to resolve their issues or else one of them were going to end up doing something they regret. \"Fine.\" Lorelei agreed. \"5…4…3…2…1. Oh look at that. Your five seconds are up. Come on Charlie.\" Lorelei pushed past the boys with Charlie following. They headed outside, leaving the boys standing in the middle of the hallway. \"By the way Otto, you dropped one of your nudie pictures.\" \"One day she's going to actually have to listen to me.\" Thomas stated. He was determined to get her to hear him out, but it was more trouble then he first thought. \"Did you at least get a chance to talk to Charlie?\" \"No, thanks to you and Lorelei bickering!\" Peter stated. Everyone was getting tired of the fighting, including Arvid and Otto. The boys headed down the stairs and Peter spotted Charlie with Lorelei not too far down the street. \"YOU!\" He yelled, catching the girl's attention, along with everyone else on the street. \" Go to my head \" he sang and the rest of the boys joined in. \" And you linger like a haunting refrain.\" Charlie couldn't help but turn red at the attention, although it was rather cute. Lorelei was used to the boys making fools of themselves and just rolled her eyes. \" And I find you spinning around in my brain. Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne !\" They sang as Arvid and Otto started dancing around together as if they were in the swing club. The girl's turned back around and started heading for home. Along the walk Lorelei got unusually quiet. \"What's wrong?\" Charlie asked, knowing that something, most likely someone, was on her mind. \"I miss him.\" She confessed. Lorelei missed going to the swing clubs and making up new dance moves with Thomas, hanging out at the hot club. She missed just being with him. \"But he makes me so angry! What makes him think I'm going to fall head over heels for him once more when he tries to talk to me after watching nude pictures? I hate him!! \"I know, cousin, I know.\" Charlie said. \"Oh! I almost forgot to ask. How did you do dancing with Peter?\" Lorelei asked, quickly changing the subject. She was determined to never let the situation with Thomas bring her down. And lately, she had been thinking so much about Thomas she had barely given thought towards Charlie and Peter. \"I wasn't very good but it was fun.\" Charlie admitted. She had enjoyed going to the swing club and dancing with Peter but she was right when she said she wasn't very good. It had taken her almost the entire night to learn the basic steps. Suddenly, Lorelei gasped and started jumping up and down. \"I have an idea!!!\" she squealed excitedly. It had just come to her; Lorelei was surprised that she didn't think of it sooner. \"I'm gonna teach you how to be sleazy!\" \"What?\" Charlie asked, slightly shocked. Sleazy? What was that supposed to mean? \"I am going to teach you to be a Swing Goddess!\" \"I don't think this is such a good idea.\" Charlie replied, looking at her cousin as if she had lost her mind. Had Lorelei taken a good look at her lately? The truth was she was positive she wasn't swing girl material. \"Trust me. You're gonna thank me for it.\" Lorelei assured her. \"And besides, how else are you gonna impress Peter?\" \"Impress Peter? Why would I want to impress Peter?\" Charlie asked, innocently. Lorelei laughed, her cousin wasn't very good at hiding her emotions. \"Come on, the chemistry between you two. It is so obvious that you like each other.\" \"I don't know.\" Charlie sighed. She still wasn't very sure about this idea. She didn't see how she would ever be able to learn to dance like the other girls at the club. \"Just trust me.\" Lorelei stated as they entered the house. \"Mama, Papa we're home!\" she called out, greeting her parents. \"Hello dears, how was school?\" her mother asked, coming from the kitchen. The environment at the Schumler household had changed for the worse since her Uncle Freidrich's death. But Lorelei's mother and father were trying to keep things as normal as possible for the girls despite the pain and the uncertainty her uncle's death had brought. \"Awful as usual.\" Lorelei stated, and started dragging Charlie up the stairs. \"We'll be in my room if you need us.\" \"Alright but dinner will be ready in an hour.\" She called up after them. Lorelei closed the bedroom door and immediately turned on the record player. Ella Fitzgerald singing Mack the Knife started playing. \"Let's see what you got.\" Next Chapter : Lorelei needs some serious help from the last person she wants to speak to. Will she convince Thomas to help teach Charlie how to dance? Till next time. Please R & R[Chapter 4] Chapter Four It was almost a week since Lorelei had started Charlie's dance lessons, and let's just say, it was not going good. Charlie was able to grasp the basics but when it came to following, and even just moving with the music…. she was pretty much hopeless. Lorelei was at her wits end because it was only three more weeks until the next swing dance. So here she was sitting in History class with Fräulein Schneider droning on about The Treaty of Versailles… again ! How the merciless nations of Europe and the United States had humiliated Germany. And how the Fuhrer had restored peace and happiness and all this other nonsense Lorelei could care less about. She was too busy trying to figure out what to do about Charlie. What she needed was some help with teaching her. Who could help her? Otto? No way! The boy had no sense of rhythm. Roger? Not after what happened last week. She continued to think of the other boys from the club but she eliminated them all until she only had Thomas left. Lorelei didn't want to ask him but he was the only one who would be able to help Charlie. After all, it was him who taught her to dance. Lorelei sighed and started tapping her pencil on the desk. There really was no other way. She was going to have to talk to him. But she would do it for Charlie and for Peter. \"Fräulein Schumler, do you intend to spend the entire class-time daydreaming?\" Fräulein Schneider demanded, bringing Lorelei's attention back to the lecture. \"I'm sorry, Fräulein Schneider. It won't happen again.\" Lorelei stated, looking up at the older lady, standing over her desk. \"Make sure that it doesn't.\" she demanded and headed back up to the front of the class. The class was soon over after that and Lorelei quickly ducked out in the hall. Thomas was at his locker, taking out his books for the next class. It was time to suck up her pride for her family's sake. Here goes nothing! \"I need a favor.\" Lorelei stated, approaching Thomas. \"Did I hear something? Must be my imagination.\" He retorted, and started to walk away from her. \"Ok ok. I deserve that but I really need your help.\" Lorelei pleaded, chasing after him. Sure she could've been nicer at first but how was he going to turn her down after hearing her suggestion? \"What is it?\" he sighed, stopping and facing her. It was typical; once she needed something she came running to him. \"I need you to help me teach Charlie how to jitterbug.\" \"Why not ask Peter?\" Thomas questioned, curious at her request. It made sense for Peter to help, since everyone knew he was the one who had a thing for Charlie. \"Because I'm doing this for him as a surprise.\" Lorelei explained. Thomas crossed his arms and smirked at her. It sounded like a great idea from the mind of his meddling ex-girlfriend. Lorelei always had a difficult time with sitting around and letting others figure their life out. If she could interfere in some way to push things quickly…she would do it. But Lorelei forgot something when she asked him for help. As much as Thomas liked the idea of setting Peter up with Charlie there was something in it for him too…Lorelei would feel obligated to talk to him now. \"OK so what's in it for me?\" \"Well what do you want?\" she asked, unsure of what he was getting at. He couldn't just do this favor out of the kindness of his own heart? But at least it was looking like he was going to agree to help. \"What I want is a chance to explain myself with no interruptions. And I want you to really listen to me too, Lorelei.\" He stated firmly. Blackmail was such a wonderful thing. \"Alright\" she sighed. \"Deal.\" They quickly made plans to meet at her house at five that evening. Thomas and Lorelei were busy moving a round the furniture in the living room when Charlie came down the stairs, holding the book she had been reading in her hand. \"What's going on?\" she asked, surprised to see Thomas over after how Lor treated him at school. She hadn't even heard him come in. Lorelei smiled at her. \"Well, Thomas has agreed to help me teach you to dance.\" Charlie sighed and rolled her eyes. The past week had been torture with trying to learn the dances and now they had an extra spectator? Not to mention the fact that Lor and Thomas could barely speak without getting angry. \"Don't you think we were subjected to enough torture these past few nights?\" Thomas curiously looked up from moving the armchair. \"What do you mean?\" He wasn't starting to regret his decision, was he? Besides, Lorelei learned to jitterbug easily. It must run in the family. \"Let's see, as my dear cousin put it last night, I'm heartbreaking.\" Charlie stated, plopping down on the couch. She wasn't sure if she wanted to do this dancing thing anymore. Was it really worth going through this much trouble to impress a boy? \"You can't be that bad.\" Thomas stated. After all, Peter had been working with her at the Bismarck. Both girls exchanged a look. This was definitely going to be interesting. \"Well let's just get started.\" Lorelei stated, moving over to the record player. She put on a Benny Goodman record and let Thomas take control of the lesson. \"Alright Charlie, show me what you know so far.\" Thomas said, as they began to dance. Lorelei and Peter had taught her the basics, so at they were doing pretty good so far. They just had to work on her posture. \"You have to put more pressure on the arms.\" He said, showing her the correct way to do it. Lorelei observed from the armchair in the corner of the room, remembering her first lessons with Thomas and Peter with a smile. After practicing the basics, Thomas decided that Charlie was ready for the more difficult steps. Little did he know how hard this would be. It seemed that Charlie did the opposite of whatever he wanted her to do. When he tried to spin her around she would turn the other way or worse, step on his feet. When he tried to lead, she wouldn't follow and this wasn't only when he spun her around…it was pretty much everything they did together. After stepping on Thomas' foot once again, Charlie turned towards Lorelei \"Alright! I've had enough of this.\" \"Why? What's wrong?\" Lorelei asked. Sure the lesson was going bad but it was only day one. She was confident her cousin would learn soon enough. \" Why ? Because I can't dance that's why!\" Charlie exclaimed, \"Besides, I'm sure Thomas has better things to do than have me stomp on his feet repeatedly\". \"Hey, it's only the first day; you can't expect to learn everything today.\" Thomas said gently. She couldn't expect to learn everything on the first try. He and Lorelei had been dancing for a little over a year! Of course, Charlie didn't have to hear about they won every dance competition they entered since they began dating. It might make her feel less confident. \"Fine.\" Charlie sighed as she got back into the basic position. She would try this. After all, if her cousin could do it, she could do it. Almost a week later, Charlie was finally ready to progress to aerials. \"I need your complete attention Charlie.\" Lorelei said, getting up from her chair \"I don't want you getting hurt. These tricks are easier than they look but you still have to be careful. First of all, there has to be trust between both partners, if you're don't trust him or you're scared, you'll end up falling on your head, or some other body part.\" \"Second, don't over anticipate the move. Partners have to have perfect timing when doing a trick because if one partner gets ahead of the other, one of you may get hurt. And third, you have to think of yourself as light as a feather. If you believe that you're heavy, no one on earth will be able to lift you, no matter how thin you are. Any questions?\" \"Are you guys sure I'm ready for this?\" Charlie asked nervously. Lorelei's speech did nothing more than frighten her. \"Easier than it looks? Are you kidding?\" \"Of course I'm not kidding.\" Ready Charlie?\" Thomas said, pulling her up from her chair and into the basic position. Charlie followed Thomas quietly; trying hard not to remember what happened to the last girl Thomas flipped. They tried everything from doing boxcars to simple flips and all of them seemed to involve some sort of accident in which one or the both of them got hurt. No matter how many times Thomas and Charlie practiced, no progress was coming out of this. Whether it was one or all of the three mistakes Lorelei mentioned. By the time Charlie and Thomas fell doing a back to back flip, Lorelei had to stifle her laughter. She couldn't help but find the situation amusing, even though it was at her cousin's expense. \"Maybe we should try again tomorrow.\" Lorelei remarked as Thomas helped Charlie up from the ground. \"Yeah I need head home. My parents have some squares coming over for dinner. They actually want me to be there this time.\" Thomas stated, grabbing his jacket from off the couch. He turned to Charlie before he headed out the door, \"Don't worry about it. You'll get it tomorrow.\" She just hoped that he was right. \"I'll walk you out.\" Lorelei offered and they made their way outside. \"She's improved a lot over the last couple of weeks.\" Lorelei stated as they stood outside on the porch. \"Yeah she has.\" Thomas agreed. \"As long as she stops hesitating and gets over her uncertainty, she'd be a rug cutter!\" \"She'll get over it.\" Lorelei stated; she had faith in her cousin. \"Well I better get going. I'll see you in school tomorrow.\" He said, awkwardly. This was pretty much the first time they had been alone since they broke up. \"Alright.\" She said softly, as he headed down the street making his way home. Lorelei really missed him but wasn't really sure on what to do about it. Regretfully, she went back into the house to have a chat with Charlie. The next day Charlie was able to do the aerials. For some reason, it just clicked after Lorelei and Thomas had demonstrated the move more thoroughly for her. Now it was the night before the Café Bismarck. \"I must say that I am impressed.\" Thomas stated as they all flopped down on the couch. Charlie had done it! She had learned everything she needed to be a hep-cat. \"Yeah, you're almost as good as me.\" Lorelei teased, giving her a hug. She was so excited for Charlie and couldn't wait to see Peter's face tomorrow. As if reading her thoughts, Thomas grinned, \"Peter is going to blow his top when he sees you.\" Well, Charlie certainly hoped so! She definitely worked hard enough for it! Next Chapter: The Café Bismarck. Charlie gets a chance to show Peter her new dance moves, plus, Lorelei runs into an old friend[Chapter 5] Chapter Five \"So…\" Charlie grinned as she was shelving some books in the bookcase behind Lorelei. They had been at work since early that morning and Lorelei had not even mentioned her talk was Thomas. \"So what?\" she asked, continuing to fill out the remaining paperwork that was on the desk. She knew where the conversation was going. \"Don't play innocent with me Lorelei Schumler; I know you talked to Thomas last night.\" Charlie said. She stopped what she was doing and waited for her cousin to give in and tell her what happened. It was only a matter of time before Lorelei would tell her. \"Fine. And I'm just letting you know that this was my part of the favor for helping you.\" Lorelei sighed as she started to recall what Thomas and her talked about last night. \"Thomas and I met Katrin at the Bismarck about five months ago and we became really good friends. Since Katrin and I were so close I never thought anything about having her around Thomas, but boy was I wrong. So, about a month ago we were supposed to meet at the Bismarck but I had to help father with the store. We were having such a hard time then with…\" Charlie knew what she would say. Her father's death and the worry about Charlie's future must have shaken everything up. \"I told Thomas to go alone and have a good time without me.\" \"I was so happy when Papa let me leave early so I could go meet Thomas.\" Lorelei smiled sadly, as she remembered that night \"I figured I could surprise him, Charlie. I was the one surprised; As soon as I walked in there they were…kissing. I haven't talked to either of them since.\" \"Well, what did Thomas have to say about all of this?\" Charlie asked. She never understood why they had broken up in the first place but now it made sense to her. This was the first time Lorelei had mentioned anything about the breakup. \"Thomas said that Katrin surprised him with that kiss. One moment they were dancing and the next she was kissing him; that he never started that kiss. He also said that he still loves me and that he never wanted to hurt me. But honestly Charlotte? I mean…Charlie? How do you get surprised with a kiss?\" \"And what did you tell him?\" Charlie asked as she leaned towards the desk, hanging on to her cousins every word. This was the stuff that romance was made of…sometimes blissful, sometimes, painful and always passionate. \"I told him I would think about it. Honestly, I wouldn't mind starting over with him but I need time.\" Lorelei answered. Part of her wanted to believe him completely and just take him back but it was so hard to forget what she saw that night. Despite the fact that Katrin kissed Thomas, it didn't seem as if he put up much of a fight in the first place. Charlie nodded, agreeing with her cousin's answer. \"Ahem.\" A voice said, interrupting the girl's conversation. Looking up the girls noticed that it was one of their regular customers. \"Can I help you?\" Charlie asked, turning red. She hoped he hadn't listened to their whole conversation. \"Yes.\" The man replied smiling at the girls \"I'm looking for a rare edition of Faust.\" \"Just a moment.\" Charlie replied as she started to head towards the back to find her uncle. To both of the girls surprise, Herr Schumler was already standing behind them. \"Lorelei, can you wrap up the gentleman's book.\" He asked, turning towards his daughter. \"Yes, papa.\" She replied grabbing the book from the shelf and running towards the back. Lorelei really hoped her father hadn't heard her sob story. It was one thing to have a customer hear about her problems with Thomas but it was a completely different thing with her father. \"I hope they didn't keep you waiting very long.\" Herr Schumler said as he rang up the purchase. \"Not at all. I wouldn't have wanted to interrupt such an interesting conversation.\" The man teased as a blushing Lorelei handed him the book. \"Thank you and have a good day.\" He added as he left the store. After the man left, Herr Schumler turned towards his daughter and niece frowning. Soon, however the frown turned into a smile as he shook his head. He could never stay mad at either of them for too long. \"Girls, why don't you go home and get ready for tonight?\" he said. Charlie and Lorelei both looked at him in disbelief; here they were expecting a lecture and now he was letting them go home early. \"Are you sure Onkel?\" Charlie asked. \"Yes. But make sure it doesn't happen again, and that means you too Lorelei.\" \"It won't happen again.\" Charlie replied as they kissed him goodbye, grabbed their stuff and ran out of the store. \"Have I ever told that you're the best father in the world?\" Lorelei exclaimed running back in. \"All of the time.\" Carl Schumler laughed at is daughters spur of the moment compliment. Best father in the world? She'd better believe it. It didn't get much better than him or his brother…May he rest in peace. Now Charlie joined their family and he will make sure that she will have an uncle who will love her like her own father did. This he promised his brother and that promise will be kept. It took both of the girls most of the evening to finish getting ready, due mostly the Charlie's nerves. \"Are you sure I look alright?\" Charlie asked, stopping just outside of the Bismark's entrance. Lorelei looked her over real quick. Reaching up, she smoothed some of Charlie's hair down, which had gotten blown out of place in the wind. \"There, now it's perfect.\" Lorelei assured her. Charlie was wearing a cream colored dress with different colored flowers on it, complete with a matching belt. Lorelei ran her hands over her outfit, which consisted of black pants and a white shirt. \"I don't know if I can do this.\" Charlie frowned, looking up at the doors where they could hear the music coming from inside. \"Trust me, you'll do great.\" Lorelei assured her, smiling at her cousin. Peter was going to be so shocked! Charlie nodded her head and followed her cousin inside. The place was packed and they had to push their way over to the table where the boys were sitting. \"It's about time you girls got here.\" Thomas commented as he spotted the girls approaching. Lorelei just rolled her eyes as Thomas pulled out a chair for her to sit. \"Hey, we were making a grand entrance.\" She laughed soon after; taking the cigarette that Otto offered her. \"I didn't think you two were coming tonight.\" Peter said, surprised but happy to see Charlie. Thomas had said that Charlie and Lorelei had to work late at the shop and wouldn't be able to make it. \"We got to leave the shop early.\" Charlie said, going along with what Thomas had told Peter. A new song had started with a fast tempo and many of the people are them rushed out onto the floor. \"Let's dance.\" A boy said grabbing Charlie's hand and pulling her onto the dance floor. Lorelei recognized the boy, but had never danced with him before. He was very handsome and a good dancer. Thomas and Lorelei look at each other and turned towards Peter who was watching Charlie in surprise. Since when did she know how to jitterbug? \"You know, Thomas and I have been working on her for a couple of weeks now.\" Lorelei commented. Peter looked at her in surprise. He had no clue that Charlie was learning how to dance. \"Yeah but we did this for you, not that square.\" Thomas continued. Peter turned back to watch Charlie for a second. The boy on the floor had just flipped her over his shoulder. A strange look came over Peter's face as he stood from his chair. He started to make his way onto the dance floor, heading straight for Charlie. \"Go get that duchess!\" Arvid yelled over the noise of the crowd as the rest of the group started cheering and making cat calls. Peter reached Charlie just as the boy spun her out. Grabbing her free hand, he pulled Charlie to him and away from the other boy. He saluted him and moved to another part of the floor to continue dancing with Charlie. \"What are you doing?\" she laughed as he swung her around. \"Did you think that I was going to actually let you dance with him? Peter grinned. Charlie just laughed and continued dancing. It wasn't long until the song ended and everyone started clapping for the band, as they stepped offstage for a fifteen-minute break. \"I'm impressed.\" Peter smirked, throwing his arm around her shoulder as they started to make their way back to the table. Charlie had danced almost a hundred percent better then the first and only time they had danced together. It was amazing what Lorelei and Thomas had taught her and they had done it without killing each other. Was there a reconciliation in the works? \"You were so good!\" Lorelei gushed, pulling her cousin into a hug as soon as they reached the table. \"I am so proud of you! All my hard work paid off!\" \"Oh yeah, I bet you suffered from the bruises and beatings as well, huh Lorelei?\" Thomas asked her, shaking his head. \"Yeah well, you helped too.\" She admitted casually. Thomas and Peter just looked at each other and laughed. Arvid made his way up to the stage with his guitar in hand. The group, along with many other people from the sidelines, made their way up close to the stage. \"All right you hepcats!\" the band leader announced. \"Get ready to jump up and down! Here's one of your own who can really break it down. The Hitman meets Count Basie! Yeah!\" The music started up with Shout and Feel It; Arvid playing lead on the guitar. The group on the floor opened up a circle in front of the stage where different partners kept switching, showing off their best swing moves. To Lorelei and Charlie's surprise, the boys made their way into the circle and started dancing together. The girls burst out laughing at the sight of them. \"They have been practicing this dance for as long as I can remember.\" Lorelei gasped out in-between laughs. \"Come on, we're not going to let them show us up, are we?\" Charlie grinned and dragged her cousin into the circle. They started dancing together, doing a series of twists and spins that they had actually come up with during Charlie's lessons. The crowd started cheering them on but before either of them could finish, the music was cut short. Almost immediately, a polka started up and everyone scrambled around for partners. \"The HJ's are coming! Hurry up!\" a girl declared. Thomas and Peter made sure that Lorelei and Charlie were by their side as they made their way towards the center of the floor. \"Oh, scheiss patrol.\" Thomas stated, as the HJ filed into the dance hall. Charlie grabbed onto Peter's arm, frowning as she observed the wannabe soldiers. \"Come on.\" Peter said, leading Charlie back to the table, followed by Lorelei and Thomas. \"Killer diller, man!\" Otto grinned as Arvid took a seat at the table. \"You were great.\" Helga said sweetly, moving slightly to make some more room at the table. \"Thanks, Helga.\" Arvid said rather dejectedly. The HJ's had ruined his performance, in his opinion. Charlie and Lorelei shared a grin; they thought that Arvid and Helga (who they had recently met but instantly liked) made a cute couple. \"Murderistic, Herr Hitman.\" Peter congratulated, patting him on the back. Everyone got situated in their seats, their eyes still trained on the HJ who were looking over the room carefully. \"Look at those pansies.\" Thomas sighed, annoyed that they had crashed their fun. He would never understand how someone could willingly join the pathetic bunch known as the HJ. \"They're all training for the Gestapo.\" Peter stated, watching to see what they were going to do. \"How did they know we were going to be here tonight?\" Arvid asked. The swing nights were usually kept secret. You only knew about them if you knew someone who was a regular at the clubs. \"Probably beat it out of some swing kid.\" Thomas stated. It seemed like the most probable explanation since none of them would give up that information freely. \"That's horrible.\" Charlie frowned. She hated the Nazi's and everything they stood for. It was them that took her father away from her. \"That's Emil.\" Peter suddenly cried out. All eyes shot back towards the group of HJ's by the door. \"Where?\" Otto asked, searching the faces for a sign of their old friend. \"So it's true.\" Thomas said, leaning back in his chair. \"Goddamn traitor.\" They had heard rumor that Emil had joined the HJ, but none of them actually believed it. \"He was probably forced into it. It is compulsory, after all.\" Arvid said, trying to think of an explaination for why their friend was now an HJ. \"Oh some excuse.\" Thomas scoffed. \"Those creeps are too busy marching up and down all day to keep track.\" \"Arvid's right, Emil couldn't be a traitor. He was the original hepcat.\" Peter said, hoping that what Thomas said wasn't true; and even though the evidence pointed towards what Thomas had said. \"Who's Emil?\" Charlie asked Lorelei. Lorelei frowned but quickly whispered to her, \"He's an old friend of ours. One of the originals from the Hotclub.\" It was right before Charlie came that Emil had suddenly stopped hanging around. Rumor had it that Emil was \"convinced\" to join the HJ after he was taken off to Gestapo headquarters following a raid at a swing club. \"No, no one who likes swing can become a Nazi.\" Arvid decided. Suddenly, Thomas started stomping his feet and making farting noises, as the HJ march out of the dance hall. Lorelei stood from her seat, and started to head away from the table. \"Where are you going?\" Thomas asked, seeing her start to leave. \"If you must know,\" Lorelei sighed, rolling her eyes. \"I'm going to the ladies room.\" She laughed at the look on Thomas' face and then continued making her way toward the back, where the bathrooms were located. The bathroom was empty but while Lorelei was still in the stall, a group of girls came in. \"Did you see who's here tonight?\" one of the girls laughed. The three girls were primping themselves in the mirror and Lorelei could hear the music start back up in the main room. \"Yeah I saw her.\" One of the other girls said as she reapplied her lipstick. \"Well, aren't you worried? She was hanging around with Thomas all night.\" The third girl asked. Lorelei knew then that it was her that they were talking about and she would bet her favorite pair of dancing shoes that one those girls was Katrin. \"Of course not.\" Katrin remarked casually, searching her bag for her face powder. \"After what I did to break them up, Lorelei won't be going back to Thomas.\" The girls all laughed and then walked out of the bathroom. Lorelei exited the stall that she was in, a look of rage on her face. So what Thomas had said was correct; Katrin had instigated the entire thing…all this to break them up. Not thinking twice, Lorelei stormed out of the bathroom, making her way to Katrin. \"Katrin!\" Lorelei yelled, causing the girl to turn and face her. This also caught the attention of the boys and Charlie, still sitting at the table only a few feet away. \"What is she doing?\" Charlie asked, noticing that her cousin was mad about something. \"I have no idea.\" Peter asked, they were all craning their necks to get a better view of the situation. \"Oh no…\" Arvid whispered, mostly to himself. He had been the first to get a full view of what was about to happen. \" You guys did see who she was following right?\" \"Oh yes!\" Thomas and Otto exclaimed together to the surprise of everyone seated. \"What? I'm about to vindicated.\" Thomas quickly corrected himself before turning towards Otto \"What are you smiling about?\" \"I know she's your main queen but two girls fighting over a man…ooh it doesn't get any more sweeter than that. And you owe me a drink from last time Swing Boy.\" He quickly added the last bit after receiving a dirty look from not only Thomas, but Charlie and Helga too. \"What do you want, Lorelei?\" Katrin asked, raising an eyebrow at her. The girl was trying to act superior to Lorelei but she was about to be knocked down a few notches. \"Why'd you do it?\" she demanded. \"I thought we were friends.\" Katrin just gave her a little smirk. \"Because I felt like it.\" She replied. Before she could even blink, Lorelei had punched her in the face, sending her flying to the ground. Blood gushed from Katrin's nose, as Lorelei stood above her. \"Come near me or any of my friends again…especially Thomas… and I will kill you.\" She stated, coldly. \"Also, next time check the bathroom stall before you go talking about someone.\" Lorelei turned and walked back to the table, where the boys sat cheering her on. Everyone stood up from their seats as she walked towards Thomas \"Will saying that I'm sorry be enough?\" \"Maybe.\" He replied with a smug expression. He couldn't resist milking this for all it was worth. \"But you might have to try a little harder than that.\" Smiling, she kissed him full on the mouth, in front of everyone in the club. The cheering only grew louder; as they made it evident that the two were now back together. Next Chapter: lunch and a romantic walk through the city. Will Peter and Charlie will they finally get their act together? Also, how will Herr Schumler react to Lorelei and Thomas being back together? Stay tuned...and till next time![Chapter 6] Chapter 6: It was late in the afternoon when the bell above shop door rang, announcing the arrival of a customer. Herr Schumler looked up from behind the front desk, surprised to see Peter Müller walk in through the door. \"Peter, I thought I'd given you the day off?\" Herr Schumler smiled. It was a slow day and he didn't need Peter's help with the deliveries. Even Lorelei had stayed home to help around the house, instead of in the shop. \"I know, sir. But I was wondering if I could take Charlie to lunch?\" Peter asked, glancing around for a sign of the girl. He saw her coat hanging on the hook by the door, so she was there, just most likely in the back room. \"Well you'll have to ask her.\" Herr Schumler chuckled. Lorelei had told him about Peter's interest in his niece. After all Charlie had been through, she deserved to be happy. Besides, Peter was a nice boy, respectful, responsible and studious. He'd be proud to have him date either one of his girls. In fact, more than once, Carl Schumler couldn't help but wish Lorelei had taken an interest in him instead of Thomas Berger. But the past is past. At least he wouldn't have to worry about Charlie, not much at least. \"Charlie! You have a visitor.\" He called out to the back room. Charlie appeared in the door, surprised to see Peter standing there. \"Hello Peter.\" She smiled, although slightly surprised as to why he was there. They hadn't spoken to each other much since the last night at the Bismarck. They were all too busy celebrating the fact that Lorelei and Thomas had called a truce to their bickering…well, if you can them getting back together as a truce. \"I was wondering if I could take you to lunch?\" Peter asked, slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of her uncle. Charlie looked to Herr Schumler to see his reaction, which looked like pure amusement more than anything else. \"Don't look at me, it's your decision.\" He told her as he started working on balancing the account books. \"But don't you need me here?\" she asked. If she left, he would be working in the shop alone. He might need help later on. \"Peter is the first person to come into the shop today.\" Herr Schumler chuckled. \"Don't worry about me; I can take care of the shop.\" \"Thank you, Onkel.\" Charlie smiled, kissing him on the cheek. Peter took her coat down from the hook and helped her into it. \"Just make sure that she is home in time for dinner.\" Herr Schumler warned. That would give them a few hours to spend together. \"Yes sir.\" Peter agreed. \"Bye Onkel!\" Charlie called out as they headed out the door. Several minutes passed as Charlie and Peter continued to walk side by side towards a small café by the river, each lost in their own thoughts. Peter couldn't understand why for the first time, he felt at a complete loss for words in front of a girl! Gripping his umbrella tighter, He was relieved at the sight of the café just around the corner. As they reached the Café, Charlie couldn't help but chuckle at the fact that it had her cousin's name written all over it. Everything from the beautiful interiors, to the romantic music and definitely the presence of just couples in this particular afternoon. She quietly reminded herself to kill Lorelei as soon as she got home for embarrassing her like this. What the hell was she supposed to do now? But thankfully, their awkward silences were soon replaced by the laughter that only two old friends could share. Time went by quickly as they laughed about her dance lessons with Thomas and Lor and shared childhood memories. \"So then, my friend Hans and I got the biggest spanking ever. He still says his bottom never felt quite the same.\" Charlie laughed. It felt great to be able to talk about her life in Munich without reflecting on the reasons she left in the first place. It had been along time since Charlie had allowed herself to remember her past life with joy. But for some reason, she felt at ease with Peter. \"And what happened next?\" Peter asked, after glancing towards his watch to check the time. \"Well, I was very lucky. Mutti couldn't stand to punish me for long so after an hour I was back to being a naughty child.\" After a brief pause, Charlie continued, \"She was very kind and beautiful. I think you would've liked her.\" \"Well if you're anything like her, I'm sure I would've liked her too.\" Peter grinned; he hadn't meant to be so forward with her but after seeing Charlie blush he couldn't help but smile. She really was different from every girl he had ever liked, proper and shy but also beautiful and intelligent. \"Thank you.\" Charlie replied softly \"That's enough about me. It's your turn to talk now.\" She added, quickly changing the subject. \"What do you want to know Charlie?\" \"Why don't you tell me about your friends? How did you all meet?\" Charlie couldn't help but notice how happy talking about his friends made him. It was obvious that he was very proud of them. \"I've known Arvid for ages now, we used to go to school together since we were little and we always had the same taste in music. But it wasn't until we met Emil that we created the hotclub. Emil taught us everything about being swing kids, being the oldest. We also went to school with Otto but we didn't really get to know him until he auditioned for Arvid's band. Thomas was the last one to join the hotclub after he was expelled from his last school. After that we immediately became friends and the rest is history.\" \"What about Lor? When did she join?\" Charlie was surprised to hear how hard Peter laughed at the mention of her cousin. So loud that the surrounding guests were looking at them, confused with his outburst. It took a few minutes for him to gain his composure before replying. \"Come on, let's get out of here and I'll tell you the rest of the story.\" Peter looked at his watch one last time before leading Charlie out of the Café. \"Lor and I have been friends since I started working with your uncle two years ago. But other than seeing each other at the shop or at school we didn't really hang out until about a year ago…\"Peter began, his eyes brightening at the memory of the day the group of friends became complete, well until now… As the first signs of winter began many of teenagers in Hamburg gathered at Platen and Blumen Park to meet each other, whether it was for a quick chat or some ice skating. This is where everyone who's anyone would be, including a group of five friends… \" Now remember what I told you Thomas, a first impression is everything. You have to creep out like a shadow...smooth.\" Emil said, giving his younger friend a last piece of advice. \" I got it. This time, I'm locking the deal.\" Thomas replied confidently, as his gaze lingered on the new object of his affection. Only she didn't know it yet. Peter couldn't help but laugh at his best friend; smooth was the last thing Thomas was being as Lorelei Schumler skated by them for the third time today. Ever since Lor had broken up with her last boyfriend, Thomas had it his personal mission to get a date with her. Of course it wasn't as easy as they thought… And Peter wasn't the only laughing at the moment… \" Great job Thomas, I'm sure you'll be sealing the deal any moment now.\" Arvid chuckled. Thomas turned towards him roughly… \" Look all I'm trying to say is that a fine dinner like her doesn't stay single for long. You have to talk to her before someone else does.\" Arvid continued, trying to avoid another argument. Their relationship had been volatile since the beginning, to the annoyance of the rest of the boys. It seemed as if one day they were fine and the next, Thomas and Arvid were at each others throats! \" How much do you want to bet that I'll be on a date with her by the end of the day.\" Thomas smirked. Arvid proudly shook hands with him. \" Fine. Winner buys the loser a new record of their choice.\" \" Deal. Now where is she?\" Thomas asked, anxiously. Now he had to do it or else, he'd have to put up with Arvid's comments for who knows how long. Plus, there was a new record he'd be looking at in Alberti's. But most of all, the thought of wiping the smirk off Arvid's face was enough to bring tears of joy to his eyes. \" There she is.\" Peter interrupted, pointing her out among the crowd. Lorelei was laughing with her friends and had clue of what was going to happen. \"Honestly Thomas, she's a nice girl, I'm sure you'll have no problem. Besides, you've got your boots on, there's nothing to worry about.\" \" I'm not worried. She won't be able to resist me.\" \" Well now's your chance.\" Emil said just as the groups of girls were skating closer to them, they were close but still Thomas hadn't made one effort to talk to her. Just as she was about to pass by them again, Thomas finally took a step forward, just as Emil tripped him with his umbrella…Instead of creeping out like a shadow, Thomas had fallen right on top of her. It took a few moments for Lorelei to register where she was at. One moment she was laughing at her friend and the next she had broken someone else's fall on the ice. Not to mention that whoever it was happened to be very heavy. After what seemed to be an eternity, someone had finally helped her off ice…it was Peter. \" Are you alright.\" \" I think so.\" She replied, but as she finally opened her eyes, Lorelei recognized Peter's friends, who were laughing hysterically. Confusion turned to anger as she put two and two together…from the laughter to the very suspicious looking boy that was looking in the other direction… \" YOU IDIOT!\" She yelled, looking at Thomas straight in the eye. \"You think it's funny to knock people down for amusement? AND THEN YOU CAN'T EVEN HELP ME OFF THE GROUND?\" Nice girl my ass…Thomas thought to himself, as Lorelei rambled on and on about how he had knocked her down on purpose. All the sudden she had turned into some crazy woman, nagging him about manners. But he had to admit, it was the cutest he had ever seen her. A few minutes passed as he let her finish her argument on the stupidity of men and sharing a glance with Emil, he knew that now was his chance. \" You know what? You're right. I acted like a complete fool and I apologize for the embarrassment.\" Thomas replied, catching Lorelei off guard. \" Well it's alright I guess. There was no harm done.\" She replied; her face breaking into a smile as she finally took notice of him. \" Of course there was. You see a righteous queen like you only deserves the best. What do you say I make it up to you over lunch? It's the least I can do.\" \" I don't even know you.\" \" Well that can be fixed.\" Thomas smiled, as he took her hand, after kissing it he replied \"My name is Thomas by the way.\" \" Lorelei. It's nice to meet you.\" She replied, smiling brightly. Peter had to look at his friend in awe at the moment. Was that whole speech really working? And here he was thinking that Thomas was pulling some sort of off time jive at the moment. \" Well Lorelei, I insist on making it up to you. Join me for lunch?\" \" I think I will.\" But before the two of them could leave Thomas turned towards Arvid one last time… \" Thanks for the new record. I'll see you at Alberti's first thing tomorrow.\" \"…Still you had to have been there it was hilarious! And Lor stills thinks that Thomas did on purpose.\" Peter finished his story as Charlie nodded her head in amusement. They really did make fools out of themselves always. \"We're here.\" Charlie sighed. They had already reached the entrance of her house. Sadly, time had passed so quickly while they were together. Charlie wished for nothing more than to be able to stop time right this moment, as Peter took her hand in his. \"We should do this again sometime. After all I have to show off my girl.\" \"Your girl? Since when?\" Charlie couldn't believe what she had just heard! It must've been a mistake; she couldn't possibly have heard that…could she? \"Since now.\" Peter smiled, and after kissing her on the cheek, he walked away whistling a familiar tune. Charlie couldn't help but stare after him until she could no longer see him; She wondered if her heart had ever beat so fast or if she had ever felt lightheaded and dizzy around a boy. It was a foreign feeling but at the same time new and wonderful. Was this what it felt like to be in love? Charlie thought to herself as she opened the door into her house. \"So how'd it go?\" Thomas Berger asked from his seat in the family's parlor. Charlie had forgotten that he was coming over for dinner. Charlie couldn't help but sigh once more before replying… \"It was nice. We went to lunch, went on a walk, I'm his girl…not much to say.\" Thomas and Lorelei looked at each other for a moment before their eyes brightened at Charlie's news. Especially Lorelei, who was a self proclaimed match maker. \"Not much to say my –\" \"Dinner's ready!\" Lorelei quickly covered her mouth at the thought that her mother almost caught her swearing. She'd be in big trouble. Gretchen Schumler, however didn't seem to notice as she gave Thomas a hug. \"It is so good to see you again Thomas. I'm glad my daughter finally came to her senses about you. I've told her time and time again, gentlemen are so hard to find in these times.\" \"I'm happy she came to her senses too Frau Schumler.\" Thomas laughed, walking towards the dinning room with Gretchen, but not before winking at Lorelei. \"What an ass kisser.\" Lorelei muttered softly. Quickly forgetting about her mother's comments for a moment she turned towards Charlie. Her mother had just interrupted a very good gossip session. \"Don't think you're off the hook Charlie.\" She added while walking towards the Dinning Room. Dinner was the same as usual in the Schumler household. Lorelei was chatting away about something as usual while Charlie quietly ate her dinner, but probably this time she was dreaming about Peter. Something that also never seemed to change was the look of death that Herr Schumler seemed to give Thomas every time they saw each other. Of course, the only person that ever noticed was Thomas, who couldn't help but feel uncomfortable while his girlfriend continued to talk all throughout dinner. \"Thomas, would you care to join me in the parlor for a moment?\" \"Yes sir.\" Thomas looked towards his girlfriend for help but she happily ushered him outside while she talked to Charlie about Peter. Taking the seat opposite for Carl in the parlor, he readied himself for the speech he was about to get. Still, he would take a speech from Carl Schumler over one from his own father gladly. \"So I understand you're seeing my daughter again.\" Carl began, frowning. \"Yes sir.\" \"I really don't know what happened between the two of you since my daughter refused to tell me. But it was very difficult watching my daughter cry because of you. I know you probably don't understand this Thomas but someday you'll be a father too. It isn't easy for us to see our children suffer, especially our little girls.\" \"And when someone hurts our children. The pain runs so deep that you're willing to make that person suffer ten fold. I hope I never see her cry like that again or we will be having problems.\" \"What a happened was a big misunderstanding. Lorelei and I have already cleared things up.\" Thomas quickly replied. Carl leaned back towards his seat, smirking. It was obvious that he was really enjoying this! \"Well let's get straight to the point then…What are your intentions with my daughter?\" Thomas shifted uncomfortably in his chair. What did he mean by that? Sure he liked Lor and they've dated for awhile but he's making it look like this was a marriage proposal or something. There was only one way out of this…answer whatever you think he'll like to hear. \"Only the best sir.\" \"That's good to hear because she deserves the best. May I ask what do you plan on doing when you finish school?\" \"I haven't really given it much thought. I suppose I'll go to the university and be a doctor like my father.\" Thomas smiled after this answer; this was easier than he thought. \"A doctor is good but what about my daughter? What do you see in your future concerning her?\" But thankfully before Thomas could think his way out of this one, Lorelei had walked in… \"Papa, what are you doing?\" \"Just making conversation. Isn't that right Thomas?' \"Yes. It is. But I think I should be heading home before my parents start to worry.\" Thomas got off of his seat quickly, while Carl continued to stare at him. He'd have to thank Lorelei later for interrupting them when she did. \"It was nice seeing you Thomas. And just so you know, I happen to love Charlie was my daughter as well so do me a favor and relay what I told you to Peter. I'll be expecting him for this same conversation soon.\" \"Yes sir\" \"Come on Thomas, I'll walk you out.\" \"Well that went quite good didn't it?' Lorelei asked Thomas as they walked outside. \"Oh it went great. Except the fact that your father hates me.\" \"Quit sulking, he does not hate you. He's just testing you…after all I am his little girl.\" Lorelei replied in a reassuring tone. \"Besides, if he does hate you like you think, I'm sure you'll prove him wrong.\" \"I should be going then. Knock me a kiss?\" After kissing Lor once more before going home, Thomas knew that it was worth all the trouble. Besides, Frau Schumler seemed to like him. Carl wouldn't be stupid enough to go against both his daughter and his wife. Lorelei chuckled lightly as Thomas walked away. She did know that her father didn't approve too much of the relationship but was sure things would turn out for the best. Besides, it was pretty funny watching Thomas squirm. Maybe that'll teach him to let random girls kiss him at the Bismarck! \"I'm ashamed of you Papa.\" Lorelei said walking inside. \"One of these days you're going to scare him away.\" She added in mock concern. \"It's not my fault that no one is good enough for my little girl…unless he's as great as your dad.\" \"No one is better than you dad.\" She replied, kissing his cheek. \"You're expecting too much of him.\" \"I'm just warning him that's all. It'll make him think twice before doing anything to hurt you. And if he still loves you, he'll stay.\" Both father and daughter began to laugh. Lorelei knew that it was natural for her father to act like that since they had always been so close. Well that was enough laughing at the expense of Thomas. Lorelei had some business to attend to… \"Charlie! Don't get think you're getting away that easily. I want every single detail!\" Next Chapter: Oh the consequences of stealing! How will everyone react to the circumstances Peter and Thomas are in? R&R;…[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: \"Fraulein Becker?\" \"Here.\" \"Fraulein handel? The History teacher asked, briefly glancing around the classroom \"Fraulein Handel?\" \"Obviously not here.\" Lorelei casually remarked, as she continued to tap her pencil on the desk as she usually did in Fraulein Schneiders' class It was no surprise that the both of them disliked each other since day one, with Lor on the receiving end of punishments and extra assignments. \"Why thank you Fraulein Schumler. Maybe you could contribute your smart observations with the extra assignment I'll be giving you today.\" The sound of a head hitting a desk was the only answer Lor gave her teacher while Charlie smiled at her theatrical antics. \"Well if Greta Handel is absent it will be safe to assume that the Jew has taking a vacation…hopefully permanent. Better for us, since we have one less Jew to deal with.\" She continued, ignoring Lorelei's indignant expression while pacing the classroom. Well she was right in a way…about the permanent vacation. But before Lor could think of another smart remark Charlie silenced her with a look. They had to be very careful with their words in public…who knew what would happen to them if they were overheard saying anything in favor of their Jewish (in this case half-Jewish)friends. It was dangerous; but hopefully Greta understood. Shrugging, she leaned back towards her seat, smiling. As she and Lor were sharing a secret that no one else was in on Greta Handel (one of Lorelei's school friends) and her parents were just one of the few families the Schumler's and their friends were helping escape Germany. Many would probably consider them to be fools after experiencing the imprisonment and death of one of the members of their family and yet they continued to help as many as they could. If anything else, the death of Carl Schumler's brother; Charlie's father only helped strengthen their efforts to do what little they could to stop the atrocities that many in Germany didn't know about or simply turned a blind eye to. Charlie couldn't help but wonder what her friends in Munich would think about what she continued to do; they'd think she was crazy or stupid at the very least. But Charlie couldn't stop doing what little she could to help the people that really needed it. Losing her father was heartbreaking and a loss she'd never recover from but Charlie was firm in her convictions and knew what had to be done. Most teenagers in Germany ignored the realities of the country they were living in and distracted themselves with trivial pursuits. But the Schumler's were a different sort of family and even Lorelei, who enjoyed trivial pursuits as much as any other teenager, felt the same way as her cousin. Just then a crumpled paper landed on her desk. Charlie opened it up, knowing exactly who had sent it… \" Did you see the look on that tart's face when she called Greta's name? What do you think Greta's doing by the way? Swing Heil!\" Charlie scribbled a quick message back… \" Yes I did. I'm sure she was surprised. Hopefully Greta's far away by now…oh! And Lor is there really a need for such language?\" Now that she had replied, Charlie could continue her personal thoughts. It was either that or going to sleep in the middle of class. The fact of the matter was: there was something bothering her but it wasn't what they were doing. It was the fact that Peter didn't know. Lorelei apparently had no problem keeping her activities a secret from her boyfriend but for Charlie it was becoming really difficult after a dating him for a month. It felt strange hiding something from a person who was becoming so important to her, especially when she never enjoyed lying very much in the first place. Just then her thoughts were interrupted by a paper hitting her in the face… \" Of course there is! What else can we call her? And what's a matter? Dreaming about Peter are you?\" Rolling her eyes Charlie quickly threw the paper back at her cousin, who was trying to hide her laughter… \" None of your business! Now stop sending me messages or we'll both get in trouble! Besides which one of us is the one that really daydreams about her boyfriend?\" \"There's no shame in that.\" Lorelei whispered towards her cousin. She had finished reading her paper pretty quickly \"Just don't tell him I said so.\" \"Ooh I think I have some blackmail material!\" \"You wouldn't Charlie!\" But before Charlie could say anything else Fraulein Schneider took notice of them. Now the both of them had detention. \"I knew we were going to get in trouble! I've never gotten a detention...Ever!\" Charlie complained as the girls were getting their schoolbooks from their lockers. Part of her wished Peter would have let her in on his plans today whatever they were, that way she wouldn't have to stay after school for the next three days with Lorelei. \"Honestly...a detention! Is that the best she can do?\" Lorelei remarked casually as they began to make their way outside. \"Oh come on don't look so beat up. There's a first time for everything, even getting in trouble.\" she added patting her cousin on the back \"Besides, it is extra time with your favorite cousin in the world!\" \"In trouble again Lor?\" A voice asked from behind them. Looking back the girls spotted Otto and Arvid. \"Well compared to the four of you I'm a saint.\" she smiled back at Otto. It was true though. Lorelei wasn't a saint by any means but she never got into any big trouble compared to the boys or expelled from a school like Thomas had been previously. A girl had to set some limits as to what she should or shouldn't do. \"True. So what's the reason today?\" Arvid asked. The boys were obviously curious since even though Lorelei didn't get into as much trouble as the boys her problems always revolved around some theatrical event. Either that or she was good at exaggerating her own stories in order to keep the boys laughing! Lorelei simply shrugged but Charlie was ready to enter into a detailed and partly exaggerated story for why the both of them got in trouble complete with dialogues and possible blackmail material. Hey! Charlie didn't like to lie but sometimes revenge is a sweet thing to savor...she'd get over the lying part. \"Well it all started when Lor sent me a paper with details about her and Thomas.\" Lorelei turned towards her cousin roughly, her mouth wide open. \"You know...private details.\" Charlie added conspiratorially as Otto leaned towards her, ready to hear what he hoped had to do with sex. Before Charlie could continue and Lorelei interrupt, Arvid brushed past them, ready to make his way outside. \"I don't give a damn about what happens to Thomas.\" He stated as he walked by his friends. Otto and Lorelei looked at each other, immediately understanding. Charlie however was confused. Didn't they usually get along? Before Charlie could ask Lorelei however, she had run out after Arvid. \"Am I missing something?\" She turned towards Otto, hopeful for a response. \"The usual. That friendship runs hot and cold.\" He sighed. \"But it's nothing new; we're all used to it.\" He added as they finally caught up to Lorelei and Arvid who were by the exit. They were close enough to overhear their conversation. \"I understand that he's a pain but you have to learn to ignore him Arvid! Half the time all he does is try to get you riled up!\" \"What he needs to learn to do is keep his mouth shut.\" Arvid retorted, angry at the fact that Lor was apparently taking her boyfriend's side. \"I'm sick and tired of his comments!\" \"And he's sick and tired of yours too. And honestly we are all sick and tired of hearing both of your comments about each other. And don't look at me like that Arvid because you know I am not taking sides.\" She continued: \"I'm just telling you what everyone else is thinking and trust me I'll be telling him too. You two need to work out your differences and stop fighting all the time. For our sake at least.\" \"We don't fight we just bicker\" A familiar voice interrupted. As the four of them turned around to see who it was, Lorelei jumped on Arvid from the fright as she was the first to recognize Thomas dressed as an HJ. For a moment there was complete silence as no one quite knew what to say. \"I know you're all wondering why we're dressed like this...\" Peter began, attempting to break the ice. He briefly wondered what they would say in a few moments, especially Charlie who looked as if she didn't quite know how to react. He could see a mixture of confusion and fear in her eyes but she hadn't still hadn't said a word. \"You're damn right I want to know. So, what's your story?\" Arvid asked both boys. As angry as he was, he needed to know what was going on with his two friends. Thomas and Peter looked at each other for a brief second, wondering who would be the one to talk… Back at the Hot Club: \"So let me get this straight.\" Otto said, leaning forward from his usual chair in the hot club. \"All of this happened because the other day you tried to lift a radio from a bread shop?\" he added confused while Peter and Thomas nodded. \"What the hell were you thinking?\" Arvid interrupted from his place by the window. \"You could've gone to a work camp for that.\" \"We were thinking of stealing that radio for you.\" Thomas interjected. It was obvious that he was still annoyed with Arvid's outburst the other day over his broken record. Arvid however was clearly appreciative over what they tried to do for him, even if it was a dumb thing to do. \"Well thanks anyway.\" \"Don't mention it.\" Thomas smiled. \"Plus it's not that bad. We can be HJ's by day and Swing Kids by night.\" He added, looking toward his girlfriend. He knew that if anyone else would agree with him, it would be his own girlfriend of course. \"Unbelievable.\" Lorelei muttered before inhaling the smoke from her cigarette. Out of all the things this pair of fools had ever done this was by far the dumbest one. She couldn't quite decide whether she should have laughed at Thomas or punched him for being an ass after hearing their story. It was the first word she had uttered since they walked to the hot club from school as she pondered what to say the whole way there. Charlie was even worse, since she hadn't said a single word just yet. \"If you have something to say Lor just spit it out already!\" Thomas hated when she acted like a typical girl...throwing out little comments here and there instead of saying how she really felt! Sure Thomas didn't plan to join the HJ but everything he did was for his friends. Besides, there was a sense of excitement behind all of this. Just the idea of fooling those Nazi bastards. Sometimes Lorelei had no sense of adventure. \"I SAID...that what the both of you did was unbelievable not to mention stupid. Do you ever stop and think about how your actions affect the rest of us?\" \"Oh you sound just like my mother! And by the way, how does this affect you ?\" Thomas replied, a hint of sarcasm in his voice. Everyone else rolled their eyes with the exception of his girlfriend who, her cigarette forgotten, pursed her lips together before replying: \"Well how do you think I'll feel walking around the streets of Hamburg with a tin-eared HJ by my side?! Not to mention the amount of danger you're in now!\" Now the both of them stood up from their seats angrily. \"If it bothers you so much Lorelei then there's two things you can do.\" Thomas smirked as he walked over to his girlfriend. \"You can either find yourself a new boyfriend or join the BDM. That way you can get rid of your Shirley Temple locks and look like one of those fausts that hang around with the HJ's. How does that sound?\" He added, pulling on one of her curls. \"THE BDM!\" She shrieked. Asking her to join the Bund Deutscher Madel, (the female equivalent of the HJ) was the most dreadful thing Lorelei Schumler could ever imagine happening to her. And wait a moment…Did Thomas just compare her to Shirley Temple? \"And how dare you make fun of my hair!\" \"Awww…are you sensitive about your new hairstyle? He teased, pulling on one of her curls. Lorelei could hear the snickers from behind her as it was obvious that everyone had found the comparison quite funny. Taking a breath she thought quietly about what her reply would be, because Lorelei was sure she looked like a swing goddess with her new hairstyle. \"Funny. That's not what you said three nights ago.\" She smirked, looking straight towards her boyfriend. The snickers turned into laughter as Thomas Berger was, for the first time, was shocked and at a loss for words. The look of shock across his features however was quickly replaced by a nervous chuckle. He never thought she would have the guts to come out and hint that something might have happened between them recently. But then again, one of the reasons why Lorelei Schumler had captured his attention so quickly was the fact that she was unafraid to speak her mind and challenge (or in this case, embarrass) him whenever she needed to. \"Let me take advantage of the fact that you are so speechless. First of all, no offense but never compare me to your mother again unless you want me to start treating you as if I were and second, the next time you suggest that I join those ugly, backwards and sexually frustrated girls from the BDM I'll make sure you never walk again!\" Lorelei added, poking him on the chest. Lorelei Schumler would never even ponder joining the BDM, where all they taught girls was to cook, clean and give birth to future little Nazi monsters! Lorelei continued rambling: \"Could you imagine me? Skipping around the streets of Hamburg singing Take hold of a kettle broom and pan and surely you'll find yourself a man! You're crazy Thomas!\" \"You forgot the rest. Shop and office leave alone…your true life work lies at home .\" Thomas added, as Lorelei sat back down in her chair. \"There's no need to be so dramatic Lor. If it's the uniform that bother's you, you'll know you'll get used to it.\" Thomas ignored what clearly sounded like an insult from his girlfriend, before continuing. \"Besides, I'm not letting Peter go through this alone.\" Lorelei sighed, knowing she had lost her battle. She had to recognize that even though what they had done was stupid, Thomas was willing to make up for his mistakes by staying with Peter. It didn't mean that things would become easier though. The thought of anything happening to either of them was surely going to cause Lorelei to worry herself to death, not that she'd ever let Thomas know how scared she truly was at the situation both him and Peter had gotten themselves into. Everyone knew that if an HJ or a member of the BDM was caught among the swing kids, their punishment would be worse. Just then, Lorelei caught sight of Charlie, who had taken the moment to stand up and smooth out her skirt. \"It's time to go home Lorelei.\" Of course, it wasn't time to leave, not even close. But it was obvious that this was where Charlie least wanted to be at the moment. But as Lorelei want to stand up, Peter interrupted them: \"Charlie…\" \"I have to go Peter.\" Charlie stated. The tone of her voice was resolute, signaling that the conversation was over. As she made her way outside, Peter looked after her for a moment, finally realizing why Charlie would have been bothered by the situation more than anyone else at the hot club. Her father had just been taken away from the Nazi's and now her boyfriend was part of the Hitler Youth…the future Nazi's of Germany. He had acted like a complete fool, and not only was he paying for his consequences but Charlie would always be reminded of her father whenever she looked at him. He was sure because it was the same way he had felt when he swore his allegiance to the Fuhrer. Anger for his father's death and disgust over the uniform he was now wearing. He quickly looked towards Lorelei for help. \"You have fifteen minutes before I walk outside Peter so make it good.\" She replied, as if she just read his mind. Peter quickly walked outside as the last thing he could hear was…\"And as for you Thomas, you have fifteen minutes to make to make it up to me so choose your words carefully… and stop mimicking me!!\" Charlie was sitting outside on the steps, her back turned towards him. Peter wasn't sure whether or not she had noticed him as Charlie continued to look straight ahead. He had no clue of where to begin or what to say as he continued to watch her. \"Do you plan on just standing there all day Peter?\" She quietly asked still not looking at him. \"No.\" He replied, taking the seat next to her. \"To tell you the truth, I don't really know what to say.\" \"Well, there's' nothing left to say now is there? You made a mistake and now you're paying the price for what you've done.\" Charlie looked at him; a touch of disappointment was evident in her voice as she never thought that Peter would let himself be talked into something like this, no matter how much they wanted to make it up to Arvid. \"Things could have been much worse you know…\" she added, not quite sure of how to continue. Charlie had been so close to losing him, as it was only by luck that he had managed to avoid being sent to a work camp. As fate would have it, Peter was still with her but now he was apart of the Hitler Youth. How ironic. As Charlie had promised herself not long ago that she'd stay far away from anyone in that uniform, from anyone who had nay connection with the men who had murdered her father. The men who had continuously barged into her home at all hours of the night in order to remind her of the agony she had suffered during the arrests, the trial, and the funeral. It may have looked like just a uniform but to Charlie it represented so much more. \"Charlie, look at me, I don't know what else to say except that I'm sorry. No matter what it looks like, I'm still the same Peter and nothing will ever change that.\" He began, while turning her face towards him. \"I know. Just promise me…that nothing will change.\" Charlie knew she wouldn't be able to stand losing someone else so soon. \"I promise you that nothing will change. I love you.\" He added without thinking. Peter had never said those three words to anyone before but with Charlie…he just knew. He was sure of how he felt and that this was the right time to tell her that. Charlie paused for a moment before smiling brightly, all she knew was that in this moment she trusted him completely…and she felt exactly the same way. \"I love you too.\" She replied quietly as Peter leaned in her to kiss her.

O ¿Lo mejorara?[Chapter 2] Pov Thomas/Voldemort: Matar a esos malditos me dio una satisfacción tan grande al verlos,quien dice que yo un vil mounstro como me cataloga la sociedad magica sera verdad. Pero yo no caeria tan bajo como lo es intentar matar a tu propio hijo solo por una absurda y boba profesia. La peliroja estaba ya tirada en el piso,sus ojos antes con brillo ahora sin nada que encendiera esos ojos,mi mirada vago por la habitación encontrandome con la cosa más bella y ángelical que puede haber en este mundo. No se porque me acerque a el y me di cuenta cuando lo tome en brazos,se sentia tan correcto tenerlo cerca, inconsientemente acaricié los lazios cabellos del niño,en eso senti un calor recomfortante,intente quitarme al niño y dejarlo sobre su cuna nuevamente. Pero al hacerlo,el Ángelical niño empezó a llorar desgaradoramente,en eso escucho un siseó. -deberias llevarlo contigo Thomas,se ve que tu magía y la del pequeño se unieron convirtiendote en su padre- dijo. Yo estaba sorprendido,sabia que habia casos que la magía de un menor no coinsidia con la de sus progenitores,pero quien diria que yo Lord Voldemort seria la persona que se haria cargo de una críatura tan linda y a la vez poderosa. -estas segura,sabes que esa maldita pasa sospechara,aunque por este niño tan lindo correria ese riesgo-dije. No se que hacer,por un lado es llevarlo conmigo y hacerlo fuerte,audaz e astuto,pero por el otro, esta que si no me lo llevo el maldito de Dumbledore lo utilizara como su marioneta destinada a matarme. -Sabes que yo nunca te mentiria con mi opinion,además que algo dentro de mi,dice que este niño sera un magnifico sucesor- siseó nagini. Yo sonrei al saber lo que pensaba mi fiel compañera,el niño miraba con interes a nagini,yo no podia creer en lo que iba a hacer,pero algo era seguro,el seria mi hijo y unico heredero,el seria el principe de la oscuridad. Un grito desgarrador hizo que saliera de mis pensamientos,Tal parece que el traidor de los Black llego justo a tiempo para ver la bella visita que les di a sus amigos. El niño en mis brazos estaba dormido,asi que con un movimiento de varita hice aparecer un muñeco que haria pasar por el bebé que cargo en brazos para que todos crean que murio. Me desapareci y apareci en mi habitación de la mansión,recoste al lindo bebé sobre mi cama,deje que nagini se recostara a su lado le puse un hechizo para que me avisara cuando despestara y me dirigi a mi despacho. Me sente en mi sofá de cuero negro y toqué la marca tenebrosa. Hogwarts, Despacho de Albus D. Podrias ver en un despacho todo destrozado,la razón,bueno esa seria porqué un mago estaba muy enojado y cólerico,pero porque es la razón del enojo. Eso es porque el hijo de los potter murio y con el poder moldearlo e utilizarlo para que mate a voldemort. Pero todo se fue al caño por la culpa de esa rata de pettigrew,ahora debo hacerle creer a todos que el heredero de los Longbottom es el salvador del mundo mágico. Otra cosa es que el maldito de severus sale muy seguido,ahora a duras penas me informa de lo que hace voldemort. Antes de que pudiera seguir destrozando mi despacho,escuche la voz de minerva. -Albus dejame pasar-dijo demandantemente. Puse un glamuor en todo mi despacho,para que así ella no se de cuenta de que todo esta mal. Abrí la puerta del despacho y la deje pasar. -Si minerva,¿qué puedo hacer por ti?-dije intentando aparentar tranquilidad. Ella me miro con tristeza. -Dicen que mataron a los potter y que los longbottom estan ingresados en san mungo en el área de cuidados extensivos,es verdad Albus,¿Neville es el elegido?-dijo ella afligida. Suspire y dije. -Si minerva es toda la verdad-dije. Cuando ella solo asíntio y se dio media vuelta le dije. -Minerva traé a severus el debe estar sufriendo por todos estos acontecimientos-dije. Ella asintio y salio a su busqueda. Solo esperaba que este cambio de planes no me terminen llevando a la derrota. Pov Severus S: Me encontraba deprimido,por un lado era la perdida por lily,pero luego de unos momentos todo el cariño que le tuve se esfumó,la razón,bueno resulta que la muy perra me obliviate, ahora recuerdo que ella se burlaba tambien de mi y que tambien sabia que los amigos de potter me hacian bromas pesadas y que una casi me mata solo porqué black \"quizo\" darme una lección. Ahora me alegra saber que esta muerta,solo que si me dolio enterarme que el niño de los potter murio. Estaba llorando suavemente,pero todo sufrimiento se detiene al escuchar un toqué en la puerta de mi despacho. Me puse un glamuor y abri la puerta, al abrirla me encontre con minerva la cual me miraba con cara de fastidio. -Lamento importunarte,pero el director te quiere en su oficina,bien eso es todo me retiro,buenas noches-dijo. Yo solo suspire,mi máscara de frialdad e indiferencia ya estaba en su lugar y con eso emprendi el viaje al despacho del director. Al llegar a la gargola di la contraseña y pase,al estar ya enfrente de la puerta toqué. Al escuchar un pase entre. -Oh mi querido muchacho pasa pasa,un caramelo de limón-dijo con su faceta más falsa de cordialidad. Yo solo nege con la cabeza. -Para que me mando a hablar director-dije directamente. Mire como el viejo suspiro y intento sonar como un abuelo preocupado por su nieto. -Se que esto sera duro,pero los potter murieron protegiendo a su hijo,el cual murio al ser tocado por la maldición avada kedrava,se que es duro pero se fuerte muchacho-dijo con un tono lastimero. Yo no senti nada,ni dolor,ni pena,solo queria que esta farsa acabara y pudiera irme a dormir. -Una verdadera lastima director,ahora podria retirarme para poder sobre llevar el dolor-dije con absoluta fríaldad. El director solo asintió y me dejo ir,ya al estar en mis aposentos me dirigi al baño,donde me di una buena ducha para despues dormir un rato. Pero parece que mi noche me tiene otros planes,ya que me quemó la marca tenebrosa. Resignado me levante y me puse una tunica encima de mi pijama. Y con eso desapareci. Capáz esto se vuelve interesante. Pov Thomas/voldemort: El primero en aparecer fue lucius,como siempre es el que acude rapidamente a mi llamado,solo odio que mi circulo interno sea tan hostigante. Aveces quisiera que me trataran como su amigo más que su Amo,pero creo que los unicos que me tratan como un amigo es Lucius y Regulus. Mi tiempo de paz se acabo cuando las barreras de mi mansión me avisa que ya llegaron a las personas que esperaba. -Buenas noches,como los trata la vida-dije sonriendoles. Enserio quiero saber la reacción de ellos. 1.Porqué es la persona que amo. 2.Porque lucius y Regulus son mis amigos. 3.porqué quiero ver cual de los dos se pelea por ser el padrino de mi hijo. ¿Quién dice que esta noche no sera tan interesante? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NA:Diganme su hay un error o algo. Bueno nos vemos luego. Se despide Alpha Bellatrix Malfoy black. Los amo.[Chapter 3] Pov Lucius: Ahora me encontraba con mi lindo drágon se encontraba tomando una siesta mientras que mi linda esposa estaba acostada despues de una noche llena de amor. Me encontraba despierto mientras miraba desde mi balcón la luna que se encontraba en su mayor resplendor. Esa imagen me daba tranquilidad y paz,Paz que fue rota por el levé picor que me dio en mi marca tenebrosa. Con tranquilidad tome mi tunica y desapareci de mi Mansión. Al aparecer a las afueras de la mansión slytherin,camine y antes de entrar me encontre con regulus el cual estaba triste. -Hey reg que te pasa-dije al verlo. El se noto sorprendido al verme. -Oh Lucius,es que por merlín Lucius estoy esperando un Hijo de sirius y el muy idiota me dejo-dijo abrazandome. Yo solo sonrei y lo abracé fuertemente. -oh Reg calma todo estara bien,solo espero ser el padrino-dije sonriendo. Escuche una risita salir y decirme. -Claro que si Luc-dijo. Al entrar nos encontramos con Moopsy. -Qué puede ser Moopsy por ustedes-dijo la elfina. Reg contesto. -Venimos a ver a tu Amo-dijo seriamente. Moopsy asintio. -El Amo se encuentra en su estudio,el Amo pide su ausencia en su estudio-dijo ella. Nosotros asentimos y nos dirigimos al estudio,tocamos y al escuchar un pase entramos. -Nos mando hablar Mi lord-dije burlón. El solo bufó. -Agradece que estoy de buen humor para no castigarte querido Lucy-dijo sonriendo. Yo hice una mueca ante el apodo y en eso regulus habla despues de reir. -Para que nos llamaste Tommy-dijo. El solo se rio y nos dijo algo que nunca esperamos. -Bueno,¿chicos quieren conocer a su ahijado?-dijo. Bueno esto no lo esperaba. Pov Regulus: Bueno quien dice que Thomas no nos puede sorprender,pero acaso dijo ¿Ahijado? Osea que tiene un hijo. Un HIJO de dudosa procedencia y que no es del tan aclamado Amor de su vida. Para ser un despiadado Amo,es un imbecil para todo lo relacionado con el amor. -¡¿QUEEEEÉ?!-dijimos nosotros dos. El solo sonrio. -No nos sonrias así y mejor explicate eso del Ahijado de dudosa procedencia-dije firme. El solo suspiro y dijo. -Bueno...-inició. (Despues de una larga y confusa historia termino) -Y bueno así llego a mi-dijo con una copa de vino en mano. Yo solo asenti y Lucius dijo. -nos lo presentaras?-dijo curioso. El sonrio y dijo. -Nop-dijo. Yo solo negé con la cabeza. -eres una mamá gallina,por eso no nos presentas,crees que te quitaremos a tu hijo-dije. El solo se encogio en brazos. -Solo tu Thomas crerias eso-dijo lucius. Pero en eso nos vemos inrerrumpidos por un suave toqué en la puerta. Pov Severus: Ya estaba confundido, ¿porque? Bueno lucius y regulus estaban hablando con nuestro señor el cual estaba soriendo. Definitivamente esta no es mi noche. 1.Los recuerdos que me borro la perra de potter (evans). 2.Albus dandome el pesame. 3.Que ahora debo estar aqui con la persona que me gusta y que nisiquiera me nota. Solo pude respirar antes de hablar. -A que se debe esta reunion?-dije. En eso solo escucho las risas de lucius y regulus. -Pues porque no dejamos que Thomas te cuente,nosotros nos retiramos alguien debe descansar-dijo Lucius llevandose a regulus. En eso Mi señor habla. -Regulus mañana hablamos de eso,ahora descansa y cuidate-dijo serio. Qué le ocurrira a mi amigo. Los chicos desaparecieron y al hacerlo,nosotros nos quedamos en un silencio muy incomodo. -Mi lord me dira a que me mando a llamar-dije,sinceramente estaba cansado. Lo escuché suspirar. -Primero no me digas Mi lord no estamls en horas de trabajo,segundo no bajes la mirada y tercero tu me gustas severus-dije acercandose a mi. Yo estaba impactado,bueno eso seria poco estoy Euforico,la persona de la cual estoy enamorado me corresponde. -No jueges conmigo-dije serio. El solo me sonrio. -Crees que juego contigo? Dime una razon-diji el. -Por Merlín soy horrible y además no soy tan poderoso,dime mejor tu una razón para creer en ti-dije. El solo se rió. -Cariño tu no eres ni feo,ni menos poderoso que yo,además que me dices de esconder tu belleza bajo un glamour?,mmm que más así me gustas desde la primera vez que te vi-dijo serio. -enserio?-dije inseguro. -claro que si,¿serias mi pareja Severus Tobias snape prince?-dijo. Yo solo sonrei. -Claro que si-lo abracé. Lo siguente que supe es que me estaba besando. Bueno creo que es el inicio de algo nuevo. Bien eso ha sido todo por hoy. Nos vemos luego.[Chapter 4] Pov Thomas: Lo estaba besando y me sentia en la gloria,pero desgraciadamente nos tuvimos que separar por la falta del aire. Lo mire con cariño al retirarme y dije en su oído. -Quedate Hoy,mañana,siempre-dije. El solo me miro con los ojos abnegados de lagrimas retenidas para no salir. -Lo haria si pudiera-dijo cerrando los ojos y bajando el rostro. Sonrei con ternura. -Mirame sev-dije levantando su rostro. -Tu me amas?-dije en su oído. El me sonrio levemente. -Con mi vida-dijo el. Yo solo lo abracé. -Entonces cual es el problema sev-dije sin entender. -Thomas no puedo quedarme ya que estoy unido a Albus por un juramento inquebrantable y si me quedo el comenzara a desconfiar y te pondria en peligro y eso es lo que menos quiero-dijo mirandome. Sabia que se tenia que ir,pero por una parte de mi quiere que se quede. -Quedate te dare una sorpresa y espero que no lo tomes a mal-dije. El me miro sin entender. -¿Qué ocurre?-dijo serio. Yo solo suspire. -Bueno te acuerdas que fui a matar a los potter?-el asintio-bueno pues solo mate a los padres,ya que ellos querian desacerse de el y pues yo no dejaria que un niño inocente sufriera,sabes lo curioso de todo es que el niño de los potter me eligio como su nuevo padre-dije nervioso esperando una reaccion. Pero severus me miraba con curiosidad. -¿como que el te eligio?-dijo confundido. -Bueno su magia me eligio como su nuevo padre,por lo que se hay casos donde ocurren casos asi donde el niño no se adapta a sus padres o su magia no coinsiden-dije. Sev me miraba impresionado. -Y tu te quedas y no acepto ningún no por respuesta ademas debes conocer a mi hijo-dije tomandolo de la cintura. Derepente sev se puso serio,pero en sus ojos se miraba el miedo, ¿Qué estara pensando? -Sev que pasa,porque tan serio-dije. El solo suspiro. -Es que tu dijiste que el te eligio como su padre y que pasa si a mi me rechaza-dijo con miedo. Yo solo negue con la cabeza y sonrei, no sabia porque pero algo muy dentro de mi me decia que el seria aceptado. Antes de que pudiera decir algo,la puerta fue abierta y ahí entro una nagini muy pero MUY enojada. -Thomas tu hijo desperto y tiene hambre ve a atenderlo ¡¡¡YA!!!-dijo ella. Yo solo suspire. -Voy en un momento nagini,vigilalo-dije. Me gire para ver a sev. -Bien,vamos sev te debo presentarte a alguien especial-dije tomandolo de la mano. -No Thomas te he dicho que debo irme a hogwarts o si no ese viejo sospechara-dijo desesperado. Solo suspire y pedi paciencia. -Severus tobias snape prince tu te quedas aqui y no te preocupes aqui nadie puede rastrearte con magia o una poción,ademas de que puedo quitarte ese juramento inquebrantable,así que no tienes excusas-dije tomandolo de la mano. El se levanto y me siguio,se veia que estaba nervioso y ansioso a la vez,no podia creer que esta persona fuera tan expresiva si cuando habla no expresa ninguna emoción. Caminamos y al llegar a mi habitación deje que sev entrara primero,se veia que estaba nervioso al entrar a mi cuarto ya que ni se sento en los sofas aue habia ahí. Mire como sus ojos oníx observaba cada detalle que habia en la habitación,note como su mirada se detenia para observar cada detalle de mi dulce niño de ojos esmeraldas combinado azúl glacial,el cual nos sonreia y aplaudia al vernos. Yo me acerque y el naturalmente me levanto sus bracitos,para luego tomarlo en brazos. -Qué ocurre cariño-dije al tenerlo cerca mio. El me miro y luego fruncio su seño para luego intentar decir algo. -Qué quieres decirme-dije. -Pá-A..pápu..Pápa-dijo aplaudiendo de alegria y feliz. Yo solo sonrei por la ternura que me dio y mire a sev el cual nos miraba con ternura y amor. -Se ven bien juntos-dijo. Yo solo sonrei y me acerque a el. -¿Quieres cargarlo Amor?-dije. El solo asintio. -Bien,Tenlo mientras pido su leche-dije. Mientras Sev lo tenia,le llame a Aster. -Aster-lo llame. En 5 min.aparecio un elfo. -El amo llamo a Aster,que puede hacer Aster por usted-dijo haciendo una reverencia. -Por favor Aster prepara una habitación para mi hijo y traime leche en un biberón-dije. El elfo desaparecio y despues aparecio con un biberón tibio. Al voltear me encontre con una escena tan linda que te podrias morir por ella. Osea severus estaba cargando a un Harry medio despierto el cual jugaba con sus largos cabellos. En eso siento un cambio en el ambiente,noto como la magia de harry y severus se fucionan. Sev me miraba consternado y yo solo sonreia. -Bueno sev bienvenido a la familia Riddle-prince-dije. El solo me miraba sin decir ninguna palabra. Buenl tal parece que la vida me ama. Bien,disfruten el cap.. Cualquier error sorry ando medio dormida. Bye los quiere: Alpha Bellatrix Malfoy black.[Chapter 5] Pov Severus: No podia creer que este bebé tan lindo y tierno,me habia elegido como su madre,no queria creer algo que capaz es una equivocación. Baje mi cabeza para ver a Hadrian,el cual me miraba con sus ojos de un color tan unicó. -Qué ocurre bebé-dije arrullandolo. El solo me sonrio y dijo. -Mamá?-dijo bostezando y tallandoce sus ojitos. Tanta ternura haria que me volviera tan debil con el en mis brazos,Thomas solo nos miraba con una gran sonrisa en sus labios. No se porque pero mi felicidad se fue al recordar que debo irme,aunque Thomas me diga que aquí nunca me encontraran,no me quiero ariesgar a que algo le pase a mi nueva familia. Familia una palabra algo en que nunca le encontre significado,algo a que para mi significo sufrimiento y dolor,familia significaba un infierno para mi y tenia pavor volver a pasar por lo mismo. -A qué le temes severus-me sobresalte al ver a Thomas detras de mi. Yo al voltearme me encontre con unos bellos ojos mirandome con una intensidad tan grande que me daban ganas de retirar mi mirada. -No se de que hablas-dije. El solo suspiro. -Sev dime a qué le temes,cariño dime-dijo abrazandome. No se porque,pero dos lagrimas salieron de mis ojos. Thomas me miro preocupado pero no dijo nada y solo me abrazo. -Y-Yo tengo miedo de que te aburras de mi y me abandones-dije con un ligero sollozo. Hadrian me miraba y me sonreia, Thomas en cambio solo me miraba impactado. -Oh amor yo nunca me cansaria de ti y te amo mucho,te quiero como quiero a Hadrian,somos una familia y siempre estaremos juntos-dijo el. Yo ya no podia contener las lagrimas. Thomas me sonrio y me acosto en la cama,Hadrian estaba en mi regazo y con sus manitas tocaba mi tunica. Sonrei con ternura al verlo hacer un puchero al no poder levantarse,como queria a este bebé. -Hay bebé,ya habra tiempo para qué puedas caminar,mejor vamos a dormir-dije. Lo acomode y los dos nos dejamos llevar por el cansancio. Pov Thomas: Mis dos personas más importantes estaban conmigo,sabia qué nadie me los quitaria a menos que quieran morir. Me acoste al lado de mi nueva familia, una familia que nunca creí que iba a tener. Hace años que queria una familia qué me amara y cuidara,pero llego albus y todo se fue al caño,Hadrian es el bebé más lindo y tierno que la vida me pudo haber puesto en mi vida. Severus es una persona genial y para hacer las cosas bien,mañana mismo le pediria matrimonio y me llevaria a mi nueva familia lejos de Londres y de Albus. El cansancio me llamaba y por ser complaciente me deje llevar por el cansancio. La noche seria magnifica para esta familia reunida al fin. ¿Durara esta tranquilidad? Quien sabe... Bien,espero que les guste este cap. Si hay algún error avisenme. Bye[Chapter 6] Pov Severus: Me desperte por los rayos del sol que se filtraban por una ventana,al abrir mis ojos me encontre con unos esprendidos ojos verde glacial que me miraban con curiosidad. Sonrei al saber que esto no era un sueño y que Hadrian estaba conmigo, lo acerque a mi pecho y mi lindo niño se recosto en el. Me levante con mucho cuidado de no despertar a Thomas el cual seguia dormido. Me dirigi al baño donde bañe a Hadrian el cual hacia pucheros tan lindos al verse que seria bañado. Me fruncio el seño cuando lo meti a la tina,lo empeze a enjabonar y le apareci una serpiente de hule más una lechuza para que jugara. Al estar ya completamente limpio, conjure una toalla verde para envolverlo y secarlo. Los dos salimos del baño y nos encontramos a Thomas ya despierto y con una sonrisa en el rostro. Hadrian al verlo,levanto sus bracitos y exigia que su padre lo cargara, Thomas al verlo,me lo pidio y yo se lo pase. --Qué tal campeón--dijo el besando su frente. Hadrian solo lo miraba con curiosidad y luego su atencion fue a parar a nagini,la cual estaba al borde de la cama. --¡¡Serpente!!--dijo emociónado. Nagini se acerco a el y Hadrian la abrazo por la cabeza,Thomas solo sonrio al ver a nagini intentando en vano sacar su cabeza de los fuertes bracitos de su cría. --Serpente Mia--decia Hadrian en un puchero muy adorable. Thomas sonrio al ver a nuestro hijo no dejar ir a la pobre de nagini la cual siseaba fuertemente. --Si,es tuya campeón,pero ahora hay que ir a desayunar--le comento Thomas. Hadrian al escuchar comida, rapidamente dejo de abrazar a nagini la cual se fue de la habitación. Thomas y yo en pijamas bajamos a desayunar,despues de haberle puesto a nuestro hijo un trajecito de color negro con una serpiente bordada. Al bajar el desayuno ya estaba servido,Hadrian estaba en su sillita la cual estaba al lado mio,le empece a darle de comer a mi bebé. Al terminar de darle su comida, empece a desayunar,al terminar de comer mi desayuno,Tome en brazos a mi hijo el cual estaba haciendo ruidos al verse ignorado por nosotros. Thomas y yo fuimos con Hadrian a la sala donde estaba nagini en un cojín. Al sentarnos Thomas me dijo. --Sev, ¿cuando quieres que te quite el juramento inquebrantable que tienes con la pasa barbuda?--dijo el. Yo me rei al escuchar el apodo de Albus. --Puede ser ¿Hoy?--dije. El solo sonrio y asintio. --Lo haremos,solo hay que dejar a Hadrian con alguien para que lo cuiden,Sabes sev deberiamos adoptar a Hadrian y cambiar sus rasgoz--dijo. Yo lo mire confudido. --¿Pero no ya es nuestro hijo?--dije. El asintio. --Si lo es,solo que lo es por magia,más no por sangre,para que sea nuestro hijo frente la sociedad magica, debemos hacer un ritual obviamente prohibido,pero que hara que lleve tu sangre y la mia así siendo nuestro hijo en todos los sentidos y no solo magíca-explico el. Yo solo sonrei al pensar en Hadrian siendo mi hijo en toda la palabra. --Ok, Hay que hacerlo pero no hoy, si no la otra semana que es luna llena--dije. Thomas me sonrio y luego se arrodillo enfrente de mi y sacó una cajita de terciopelo negro. --Sev ¿quieres ser mi esposo y madre de Hadrian? --dijo Thomas. Yo con Hadrian en brazos asentí y lo bese. El me puso el anillo y me abrazo. Qué buen inicio tuvó este amanecer.

The Monstars were inside their house sitting on the couch in the living room next to their brightly decorated Christmas tree watching Christmas specials on TV next to their nice warm fireplace with their stockings hung up. Each of their stockings showed their names and represented the color of their skins. While eating chocolate chip cookies with milk from the coffee table, The Monstars were excited about the holidays coming up. \"Man guys, I can't wait for Christmas to come in the next five days!\" Blanko said smiling. Bupkus agreed, \"Blanko I couldn't agree with you more.\" Nawt said, \"Me too. It's great to spend the holidays together like a family. Because that's what the holidays are all about, family.\" Pound agreed, \"You're right Nawt. We are kinda like a family. I mean we do live in the same house together and came from the same planet together. Besides you guys are like brothers to me.\" Bupkus replied,\"You two are right. We're the Monstars!\" Bang said, \"You guys do make a good point there. We're a family.\" The five Monstars nodded their heads in agreement. When the specials was over, Pound turned off the TV and suggested, \"Alright. What do you guys say we head out to the Ice Cream Parlor for some frosty milkshakes? My treat.\" The boys were happy about the suggestion. \"Yeah!\" They cheered. After the Monstars got their winter gear on, they went out the front door of their house. As Pound locks the door shut, they went inside their car and left the driveway. While the boys were on their way to the Ice Cream Parlor, Nawt had an idea. \"Hey guys! I was wondering, since we're celebrating the holidays like a family, we should share that experience with others.\" Bang turned around and asked, \"What do you mean Nawt?\" Nawt replied, \"I mean we should invite all our friends over to our place for a Christmas party on Christmas Eve night and show them the true meaning of the holidays.\" \"You know, that's not a bad idea Nawt. We could exchange gifts, sing carols, play games, watch TV, dance and have a nice hot Christmas dinner.\" Pound said eagerly. \"Yeah Nawt. Good idea dude.\" Blanko said while patting Nawt on the back. Bupkus says, \"Sounds a little complicated but let's do it.\" Nawt smiled at what the others said about his idea. \"Thanks you guys. This is going to be the best Christmas ever! You want to know why?\" \"We're a family.\" They all answered. Finally, they arrived at the Ice Cream Parlor for some delicious frosty milkshakes. ,[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Later in the Ice Cream Parlor, the Monstars were sitting down at a table drinking their milkshakes. Pound had strawberry, Bupkus had chocolate, Blanko had vanilla, Bang had cookies and cream, and Nawt had double fudge topped with whipped cream, chocolate syrup,and a cherry on top. While the boys were still drinking, they noticed someone walking towards their table. It was Bupkus' girlfriend Carla. Smiles were shown on their faces as they saw her in her purple coat wearing pink mittens, blue jeans, and red rubber snow boots. \"Carla! Merry Christmas.\" They said with glee. She smiled and replied, \"Thanks. Merry Christmas to you too guys.\" Bupkus got out of his seat and gave her a big hug and kiss on the lips. \"How are you doing baby girl?\" Bupkus asked wiggling his eyebrows. Carla responded, \"I'm fine handsome, thanks for asking.\" As Bupkus got back to his seat,she looked at the rest of the Monstars and asked,\"How are you guys?\" \"Great now that you are here.\" Pound said smiling. She blushed at what Pound said to her. \"Thanks Pound. You're so sweet.\" \"So what brings you here dudette?\" Blanko asked. Carla explained, \"I'm just stopping by here with my friends before I do some Christmas shopping. How about you guys?\" Pound said, \"Same here, we're just here for some delicious frosty milkshakes before we do some shopping in the mall. We're also going to decorate the outside of our mansion to make it look more Christmas-y.\" Carla said \"That sounds great. So any ideas on what you boys are going to do for the holidays?\" Bupkus replied, \"Actually , I remember Nawt had an idea on what we're going to do for the holidays when we were in the car. Right Nawt?\" Bupkus elbowed Nawt's arm and winked at him. \"Idea? What idea Nawt?\" Carla asked as she looked at him. The red Monstar cleared his throat and explained as he twiddled his fingers on the table. \"Well, you see Carla. I had this idea of us throwing a party on Christmas Eve for all of our friends and neighbors because I want everyone to get together, have fun like a big family and learn about the true meaning of Christmas. I was wondering if you and your friends would like to come too.\" Carla understood what Nawt said and accepted the offer. \"That sounds like an amazing idea Nawt! Yes I would love to come and I'm sure my friends would love to come the party too. You're a smart thinker.\" Nawt smiled and blushed at Carla's nice words, \"Thanks Carla. You say the sweetest things.\" \"Speaking of friends, would you guys like to meet my friends?\" she asked the boys. The five Monstars faces lid up and Pound said, \"Sure, we would love to meet your friends.\" After the boys finished their delicious frosty milkshakes, they got off their seats and followed Carla as she head to the table where her friends are. ( I bet you're wondering, who is this Carla you speak of? How does she know the Monstars? And when did she and Bupkus became a couple? Find out in my upcoming story, \"Bupkus and Carla Sitting In a Tree.\" )[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: When Carla and the boys made it to the table where her friends are sitting she said hello to them and her friends did the same thing to her. She turned to the Monstars and introduced them. \"Boys I would like you to meet my friends Kenneth, Joy, Megan, and Greg.\" Carla's friends turned around to the Monstars and said hello to them. Carla turned back to her friends to introduce the Monstars to them. \"Guys, I would like you to meet the Monstars. This is their leader Pound the orange one and his crew. Bang the green one,Blanko the blue one,Nawt the red short one, and my boyfriend Bupkus the purple one.\" Kenneth was a male with dark brown skin, black short hair, and brown eyes while wearing an orange coat, blue jeans, and blue snow boots. Joy was a light skinned female with long light brown hair, and blue eyes while wearing a violet coat, long jeans, blue jewel earrings, and black boots. Megan is a female with also dark brown skin with long black hair, brown eyes and pink lipstick wearing a turquoise coat, khaki pants, and brown pants. Finally, Greg was a tan-skinned male with short black hair, and brown eyes wearing little jewel earrings, a grey jacket, tan pants, and green boots. The five Monstars waved at Carla's friends as they said, \"Nice to meet you guys.\" Kenneth said, \"It sure is! We heard a lot about you guys.\" Megan agreed, \"Indeed, any friends of Carla's are friends of ours.\" Joy looked at Bupkus and said, \"So Bupkus, you're Carla's handsome boyfriend? You must be really lucky to have a girl like her.\" Bupkus smiled as he walked to Carla and gave her a one-arm hug. \"Well she is one of a kind.\" He chuckled. Bupkus got closer to Carla and kissed her on the forehead causing her to blush instantly. \"Bupkus, you're embarrassing me.\" Carla giggled. Kenneth asked, \"Anyway, what are you guys doing for the holidays?\" Pound replied, \"Well we're planning on throwing a Christmas party at our place on Christmas Eve night in the next four days and we were thinking if you guys would like to join us when the time comes.\" Carla's friends were interested in the idea so they accepted the offer. \"Sure Pound. We would love to come to your party.\" They all said. Megan agreed, \"Yeah! Having a Christmas Eve party is a great you guys.\" Nawt spoke up and said, \"Actually I was the one who came up with the idea.\" They looked at the short red alien and smiled at him. \"Still, having party on the night before Christmas is a awesome idea Nawt.\" Greg said. Joy agreed with Greg, \"Yeah. Good thinking Nawt.\" He smiled at Carla's friends knowing that they were on board with the idea. \"Thanks you guys. I promise you all that this is going to be a Christmas to remember.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Greg asked, \"So what's going to be the location for the party?\" Pound answered, \"The location for our Christmas party will be at our mansion on Marley Lane. The party will start at 4PM and end at 11PM.\" Carla's friends couldn't believe what Pound said. They exclaimed, \"You guys live in a mansion?!\" Pound responded, \"We sure do.\" Kenneth replied, \"Wow. That's amazing you guys!\" The five Monstars smiled at Kenneth's compliment. \"It's going to be really fun. I'll make the flyers for the party.\" said Pound. The rest of the Monstars volunteered to set things up for their upcoming Christmas Eve party. Blanko said, \"I'll get the Christmas music.\" \"I'll blow the balloons.\" said Bupkus. Nawt said, \"I'll hang up the streamers in the living room.\" \"And I'll make the food and get the snacks\" said Bang. Megan said, \"Man, this party is going to be a blast!\" Greg agreed, \"Man, I can't wait for this celebration during this time of year!\" Pound replied, \"Thanks. Anyway you guys, my team and I are about to head out to the mall to do some Christmas shopping. It was nice knowing you all and we'll see you at our Christmas Eve party.\"Carla and her friends said their goodbyes to them and the five Monstars went back to their table to put on their winter coats and hats on. Before they left the ice cream parlor, Bupkus turned to Carla and blew a kiss at her while Carla did the same to Bupkus. \"Later baby girl.\" Bupkus said as he winked and flashed a smile at her. Carla responded as she waved her fingers at him, \"Back at cha handsome.\" As the boys left the ice cream parlor, they went back inside their car and drove out of the parking lot to head to the mall to do some shopping. Finally when the boys arrived at the mall , they went inside and received the biggest shock of their lives. The mall was packed with customers! Blanko said, \"Woah! This entire place is packed!\" Bupkus replied, \"You think that's bad? Wait until you see the line for the bathroom.\" \"Alright boys enough with the chit-chat! Let's split up and get shopping! I'll meet you guys next to Santa's Workshop at exactly 8:30.\" Pound told his team. \"Right!\" They all said.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: After the Monstars split up, the five of them went to different stores in the mall to buy Christmas gifts for each other and their friends. After 3 hours of shopping, the boys pulled out their cell phones and realized it was 8:20 pm. So they hurried to Santa's Workshop where Pound was waiting for them. When Pound saw his four friends heading towards him with their hands full of gifts, he said, \"Right on time you guys. Now that we have our gifts, let's head back home for dinner and wrap our presents.\" \"Right.\" The four of them replied. While the Monstars carried the gifts, they all left the mall and headed to their car and put their bags full of presents in the trunk. As the boys got back inside the car, they drove out of the parking lot and went back home. Meanwhile at the Monstars' mansion, after the Monstars ate dinner, they wrapped their presents for each other in their rooms and went downstairs to put their presents under their Christmas tree. They also put the other batch of the presents for their friends under their miniature Christmas tree on the coffee table in front of the TV after they signed the presents with each of their names and each of them saying who is it for. Nawt smiled with glee and said, \"Man guys! Our friends are going to be so surprised, I can't wait till they see and open our presents under our mini tree!\" Blanko agreed, \"I know right dude? This party idea you came up with is going to make this the best Christmas ever.\" Nawt smiled at what Blanko said to him, \"Thanks Blanko.\" Bang yawned and said, \"I don't know about you guys but I'm getting tired.\" The other Monstars agreed with Bang by nodding their heads. \"Alright boys, lets all brush our teeth, and call it a night because we got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.\" Pound told the others. So the five Monstars went to the bathroom to brush their teeth. After they were done, they went upstairs into their rooms to put on their pajamas, turned off their lights and headed straight to bed.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The next day, the Monstars were having a team meeting outside the mansion while wearing their winter clothes and boots on. While the rest of the four boys sat on the front porch, Pound was standing in front of them giving them orders to decorate the outside of their home. Pound told them, \"Alright boys, our Christmas Eve party is only three days away and we want to make the outside of our house look Christmas-y around here. Blanko and Nawt, I want you two to hang the lights around the roof. Bupkus and Bang, I want you two to get the inflatable snowman and Santa statue. And I'll hang the wreath on the front door.\" Bupkus responded, \"Sure thing Pound. You can count on us.\" Blanko added, \"No problemo dude. Hanging these lights will be a piece of cake.\" So the Monstars went to each section of the house to get the decorations for their mansion. Pound, Blanko, and Nawt went into the garage to get some Christmas lights for the roof and a Christmas wreath for the front door and Bupkus and Bang went into the attic to get the inflatable snowman with an air pump, and a medium-sized statue of Santa Claus for their front lawn. Once the boys got all the things they need, they headed back outside to start decorating the outside of their house. Bupkus inflated the inflatable snowman with an air pump on the right side of the front yard,Bang carried the Santa statue and puts it on the left side of the front yard, and Pound hanged the wreath on the front door. Meanwhile, Nawt and Blanko were on ladders hanging up colorful Christmas lights on each side of roof. Blanko was on the left side and Nawt was on the right side. When they were done, Pound looked up and called the boys. \"Blanko! Nawt! Are you two done up there?!\" The two of them went down the ladders until they touched the ground. Blanko said, \"We sure are man. The Christmas lights are all setup Pound.\" Nawt turned on the lights by pluging them in and caused them to flash. Pound turned around and was amazed as he looked at beautiful,flashing lights around the side of the roof. Pound said, \"Wow. You two did really a good job decorating the roof.\"Even Bupkus and Bang were amazed at the lights. \"Cool lighting.\" Bang told them. \"Awesome!\" Bupkus added. As Nawt unplugged the lights, him and Blanko smiled at each other and gave each other a low five. Bang asked, \"Now what?\" Pound responded, \"Now it's time to get the supplies for the party.\" Bupkus said, \"That's great Pound because we got it all figured out. Nawt and I will head to the party store to get some balloons,streamers, and a banner that says \"Merry Christmas\" on it.\" Blanko said, \"I'll stay home and find some Christmas music for our CD Player in our music cabinet.\" Bang said, And I'll head to the grocery store to a lot of snacks for the party and food for our big Christmas Eve dinner.\" Pound felt a little surprised but understood that his own team had everything under control. \"Um...okay. It's great that you boys already have a plan. In the meantime, I'll make the flyers.\" \"Alright. Let's do this!\" Nawt said eagerly. Suddenly out of nowhere, Bang's stomach started to growl. \"But before we do any of that stuff, let's grab some lunch. I'm getting hungry.\" Nawt replied, \"Your not the only one who's hungry.\" The Monstars agreed by rubbing their Pound suggested, \"I've got an idea. Why don't we all head back inside the house for some bologna sandwiches?\" The gang like the idea so they went back inside the mansion to head to the kitchen to make some bologna sandwiches.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: After they finished their sandwiches, the Monstars were ready to get the things they need for their party such as balloons, snacks, food, music, streamers, and a banner that says \"Merry Christmas\" on it. \"Well boys. I'm heading to the office room to make the flyers for the party.\" said Pound as he got out of his chair. Bupkus said, \"Well Bang, Nawt and I are going to run downtown to get the things we need for the party.\" Nawt grabbed out the list and added, \"I even made a list last night.\" Bang looked at Blanko and asked, \"Hey Blanko. Wanna come with us?\" Blanko replied, \"Actually I'm going to stay here because I'm pretty sure that we have some Christmas music in our music cabinet in our living room.\" Bupkus shrugged and said, \"Okay. Suit yourself.\" After the boys put their winter gear back on, they went outside and ran downtown for some food and party supplies. Meanwhile, Blanko was in the living room pulling out holiday party music from the music cabinet under the TV and puts them on table on the left side of the couch where the music player is. Pound was in the office room on the computer working on the flyers for their Christmas Eve party. After he printed out one flyer, he gave it a good look at it. He thought to himself, \"Not bad if I do say so myself.\" The invitation showed a picture of the Monstars all together surrounded by a background of snow, holly plants on each corner of the flyer, and the top saying, \"You're invited to our Holiday Extravaganza Party in the Monstars' mansion on Christmas Eve. The bottom showed the party's date,time, and address. As Pound takes the printed flyer,he flips it over and put under the lid where the printer's copy section is. He pushed the Copy button to make copies of the flyers for everyone. When the copies were done, he carries them to the dining room and puts them on the table. Blanko walks up to Pound and asks, \"Hey Pound. How are the flyers coming along?\" As Pound shows him the flyers, he says, \"Pretty good Blanko. See for yourself.\" Blanko looked at the flyers at said, \"These flyers look pretty good dude.\" Pound smiled, \"Thanks Blanko.\" It was 6:00 in the evening and Bupkus,Bang,and Nawt came back home from shopping and got all the things they need for the party. Bupkus unlocked the door and shout out, \"Hey guys we're back!\" As he closes the front door, Pound and Blanko noticed that the three boys were back. After they closed the door shut, Blanko said to them, \"Hey dudes. Did you boys get everything we need for the party?\" Nawt repsonded, \"We sure did. Bupkus and I got streamers,balloons, and a banner that says Merry Christmas on it.\" Bupkus added, \"The streamers and balloons are also green and red to show that Christmas spirit for our party.\" \"Nice job you.\" Pound said as he gave them a thumbs up. After Bang puts away the all groceries, he walks up to Pound and says, \"I also got lots of drinks and snacks for the party and food for our big Christmas Eve feast for all of our friends and neighbors.\" Pound smiled at the four boys, \"Great job you guys! Next meeting will be tomorrow in the afternoon.\" \"Right.\" The rest of the Monstars said.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: The next afternoon, Bupkus was hanging mistletoe above the front door for Carla. Suddenly, Pound walked behind him and tapped him on the shoulders to get his attention. As Bupkus turned around to face Pound, he asked, \"Oh hey Pound, what's up?\" Pound replied as he raised his eyebrow, \"What are you doing?\" Bupkus answered, \"I'm hanging mistletoe under the front door for the upcoming party for when Carla arrives.\" Bupkus wiggled his and smiled as he continued, \"Once Carla steps inside the house and sees me under the mistletoe, it'll be smooching time.\" Pound smiled and reminded Bupkus about the team meeting. \"That's great. Also I want to remind you that we're about to have a team meeting in the living room in the next 2 hours.\" \"Yeah. I know the drill.\" Bupkus told Pound. As Pound walks away, Bupkus finally finished hanging up the mistletoe. He smiled and stood proudly as he thought to himself, \"Wait until Carla sees this.\" Two hours later, while Blanko, Bang, Bupkus, and Nawt were in the dining room drinking soda, Pound was in the living room and shout out, \"TEAM MEETING IN THE LIVING ROOM!\" As the four aliens heard Pound's voice and got out of their chairs, they raced to the living room and sat on the couch. Pound faced and stood directly towards them. Pound mentions to them about the flyers in the dining room, \"Okay boys. When the four of you boys were in kitchen drinking sodas, you guys saw copies of the flyers I made yesterday on the dining room table, correct?\" The four of them nodded their heads and replied, \"Yes. We saw them.\" Then Nawt added, \"We also thought the flyers you made looked pretty good.\" Pound smiled at Nawt's compliment, \"Thank you Nawt.\" He continued to discuss his team about his big plan, \"Anyway, back to the topic. Since we decorated the outside of our mansion and got everything we need for the party, today we're going to post all those flyers around town for all our friends and neighbors to see.\" Bang asked, \"Pound. How are we going to post those flyers all around town?\" \"We'll just have to post these flyers up together as a team when we get there. I even got a hammer and a bucket of nails. Now let's put on our winter coats, hats and boots on hang those posters all around town.\" Pound replied. \"Right.\" They all said. After the Monstars got their winter gear on, the boys went to the dining room to grab each stacks of flyers. Once they all grabbed all the flyers, they wrapped each flyer with a rubber band and went out the front door. As they closed the door, Pound and the others head to their car and put the wrapped stack of flyers in the trunk of the car. Pound also put the bucket of nails with hammers in the trunk too. As Pound closes the trunk, he says to the team, \"Alright boys! Let's post these flyers.\" After the Monstars got inside the car, Pound starts the car and leaves the driveway to head downtown.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: When the Monstars arrived downtown in the city, Pound parked behind two vehicles and the got out of the car, As Pound opened the the trunk with a hammer, a bucket of nails, and the wrapped stack of flyers for their Christmas Eve party inside he told the others, \"Okay boys. Let's get started hanging these flyers.\" As Pound grabs the bucket of nails and the hammer, the other Monstars grabbed each stack of flyers and closed the trunk. The five boys unwrapped the flyers and hanged them on telephone poles all over town. As time passes by, the sky was getting dark, the lamp posts were turning on, and the Monstars were exhausted after hanging up all those flyers around the city. \"Man, hanging up all those flyers around town was exhausting.\" Nawt moaned. Bang replied, \"Look on the bright side. We finished hanging up all those posters all over town.\" Bupkus responded, \"You got that right Bang.\" Then out of the blue, the boys heard another rumbling noise, it was coming from Blanko. \"Is anyone hungry beside me?\" he asked. The rest of the gang agreed by nodding their heads. Pound suggested, \"Boys. How about we head back to the mansion and heat up some frozen pepperoni pizza.\" Everybody liked the suggestion, so they went back inside their car and drove home. Meanwhile back inside the Monstars' mansion, the boys were in the dining room eating pepperoni pizza. After they finished eating, they cleaned their plates in the sink and put them in the kitchen cabinet. \"Man, that pizza was good. Nawt said with a satisfied face. \"You can say that again dude.\" Blanko agreed while rubbing his belly. \"I'm glad you guys enjoyed it. Now let's hit the hay you guys. Tomorrow we'll have one more day left to finish planning our big party.\" Pound told them. \"Got it!\" The four boys said. After the Monstars brushed their teeth in the bathroom, they went upstairs into their rooms and closed their doors to put on their pajamas. In Pound's room,he wore his blue pajama shirt,pants, and night cap on. In Bang's room, he wore his orange and white striped pajama shirt and pants on. In Bupkus' room, he wore on his light blue tank top and shorts. In Blanko's room, he wore a blue night mask around his head with his grey tank top and shorts on. Finally, in Nawt's room, he wore his light red footie pajamas on. As they got into bed, they said good night to each other and slept through the night.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Later in the morning, Pound,Bang,Bupkus,Blanko, and Nawt were in the kitchen about to eat some breakfast while they were still in their was making some delicious Christmas tree themed cinnamon waffles that are also cakes sprinkled with powdered sugar for him and the boys. Bang gives them their waffles he says, \"Breakfast is served!\" While Bang was eating his waffles, Pound and the rest of the boys looked down at their waffles and took a bite off of it with their forks. After they took a bite of their waffles, they were amazed by the flavor and caused their faces to light up. \"Wow! These waffles you made taste amazing Bang!\" Pound said with glee. \" It's delicious! Right on dude!\" Blanko added. \"I agree. These waffles are far out man!\" Bupkus said with delight. Bang smiled at what the rest of the team said about his waffles, \"Thanks. I'm glad you guys loved my waffles.\" After the gang finished eating their Christmas tree waffle cakes, they cleaned their dirty plates and put them in the cabinet where dishes and glasses are.. \"Ok boys, let's head back upstairs into our rooms and change into our clothes.\" Pound told the others. So the five Monstars went back upstairs into their rooms and changed into their jerseys and put on their shorts and sneakers on. After they went downstairs, they went to living room as they got on the couch. \"Hey you light up the fireplace for us?\" asked Pound. \"Sure thing.\" Bang replied. As Bang got off the couch and headed to the fireplace, he threw some wood in and used his firebreath to heat up the living room. Bang went back to sit on the couch with his friends. Seven hours later, the Monstars were watching TV while drinking cans of soda, when suddenly Bupkus' phone started buzz. He picked it up and saw that Carla sent him a text. Carla: \"Hey Bupkus. How's the party planning with your friends coming along? Bupkus text back: \"It's coming along great Carla.\" Carla: \"That's great! Our friends saw the flyers for party all around town and we thought they looked wonderful. After all of our friends saw them they became interested in joining the party tomorrow night.\" Bupkus: \"That's great to hear! I can't wait to tell my friends the good news! See you tomorrow night sweetie.;-) Carla: \"Me too. Later handsome ;-) Aftet Bupkus stopped texting Carla, he put his phone away and told the rest of the Monstars the good news. \"Hey guys. I have some great news.\" Bupkus told the others. The rest of the boys looked at him and asked, \"What is it?\" Then Bupkus continued to say the good news. \"Carla texted me and said that all of our friends and neighbors saw our flyers we posted all over town and that a lot them are intrested of coming here for the party tomorrow night!\" The other Monstars smiled with glee after they heard the good news. \"That's amazing Bupkus!\" Pound said. \"Right on dude!\" Blanko cheered. \"It's a good thing we posted all those flyers around town.\" Bang said Nawt agreed with Bang, \"It sure is. Tomorrow will be the best Christmas Eve ever!\" Pound told the team, \"Okay boys. Tomorrow afternoon, we're going to get everything set up for our big party.\" \"Alright!\" The rest of the boys cheered.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 : On Christmas Eve morning after breakfast,the Monstars were having another meeting in the kitchen. Pound reminds them about their party,\"Well boys, this is it, today is Christmas Eve and our party starts this evening.\" The four boys were excited about the big night. \"Man you guys, this is going to be the best Christmas Eve ever!\" Nawt said with glee. Blanko agreed with Nawt, \"I agree little dude. I can't wait for all of our friends and neighbors to come over to our mansion to celebrate the holidays together.\"Bupkus replied,\" Me too. I can't for Carla to show up. The other Monstars rolled their eyes and replied, \"We know.\" Bupkus continued to talk about Carla as he wiggled his eyebrows and smiled,\"Once Carla steps inside the house and sees me under the mistletoe,all aboard the smooch train.\" Pound retorted, \"Easy there Romeo.\" Bupkus blushed gave a nervous chuckle. \"Sorry. Got a little carried away.\" Bang said, \"Well, I'm excited to cook a giant feast for us and our friends tonight. Today after I finish the snacks, I'm going to work on a secret holiday project in the kitchen.\"Pound responded, \"Sounds like a good plan Bang. Remind us when you're finished later on.\" \"No problem.\" Bang replied.\"Alright boys. Time to set everything up for our big party tonight! So let's go go go!\" Pound ordered his team. So the Monstars all pitched in and worked together to get everything ready for their big Christmas Eve party tonight. Bupkus was blowing the red and green balloons with an air pump and tying them each at the bottom. Nawt was hanging green and red streamers on the corners of the walls. Blanko brought out the tables for to put the snacks on next to the kitchen, Pound placed the Christmas themed napkins on the tables, and Bang was wearing his Chef hat and a black apron with flames on the bottom while working on the snacks and drinks in the kitchen. He made Christmas cookies, gingerbread cookies, brownies, fruit cakes, cupcakes with green and red frosting on each of them, and pulled out some beverages such as such as fruit punch, cans of soda, and eggnog. After he puts the drinks and snacks on the tables next to the stack of paper plates and plastic cups, he heads back to the kitchen so he can work on his holiday project that he's been working on since the beginning of December. Later on in the afternoon, the Monstars took a lunch break in the dining room and ate leftover Chinese takeout from the fridge. After six hours of preparation, it was 3:50 PM and the boys were finally done preparing everything for their party. Pound wiped his head from exhaustion and said, \"It took awhile you guys but we finally did it.\" Blanko responded, \"You can say that again Pound. I can't wait until our friend sees how much we've prepared for the party.\" The other Monstars agreed with Blanko as they nodded their heads. \"Alright boys,let's head upstairs to our rooms and change into our Christmas clothes.\" The five Monstars went upstairs and into their rooms to change into their Christmas clothes. Pound wore a red sweater with an image of a Christmas tree on the front,blue jeans, and black sneakers;Bupkus wore a light blue sweater with an image of multicolored Christmas lights,dark blue jeans,and purple tennis shoes;Blanko wore a grey sweater with an image of Santa, light blue jeans,and sneakers;Bang wore an orange sweater with an image of a reindeer, blue jeans, and orange sneakers; and Nawt wore a blue sweater with an image of a snowman, light blue jeans, and red sneakers. After they changed into their Christmas clothes, they heard the doorbell ring and the Monstars went downstairs to answer it. \"That's gotta be our friends!\" Nawt said with glee,\"I just know it!\" So the boys rushed to the front door. Before Pound opened the door, he turned around to face his team. \"Alright, Christmas faces everyone.\" he told them while flashing them a smile. The four Monstars smiled back and Pound opened the door. Once he opened the door, they received the biggest shock of their lives, all of their friends,fans, and neighbors had arrived at front of the mansion. \"Merry Christmas Monstars!\" they all shouted.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12: The Monstars were pleased that all their friends such as the Looney Tunes gang, Carla's her friends, and their neighbors showed up outside the mansion with presents for the five of them in their winter gear to get ready for their big Christmas party. \"Merry Christmas everyone!\" said the five aliens. \"Wow, this incredible!\" said Nawt, \"All of you guys made it here on time for our party!\" Carla replied, \"Well of course we did, boys. We wouldn't miss it for the world.\" \"Thanks Carla.\" said Pound, \"That means a lot to us.\" \"Yeah,dudette.\" said Blanko, \"Our party is gonna be awesome.\" \"So where should we put our presents for you boys?\" asked Lola. \"You guys can put those in our living room on the table next to the presents we have for everyone.\" said Bang.\"Well everyone, what are we waiting for?\" asked Pound, \"Let's head inside the mansion, get this party started and spread some holiday cheer!\" \"I'll crank up the tunes!\" said Blanko. The Monstars' friends and neighbors took off their winter gear as they went inside the mansion with all their presents and put them on the table until Carla was the last one to come in. After Pound closed the door shut, Carla saw how lovely the Monstars look in their Christmas clothes. \"Wow. You boys look so handsome in your Christmas clothes.\" The five Monstars blushed and smiled at her compliment. \"Thanks Carla.\" they said. Suddenly, she noticed there was a mistletoe above her on the top part of the door. Carla smiled and raised her eyebrow at Bupkus knowing that he was the one who put up the mistletoe. \"Bupkus, did you put up the mistletoe?\" asked Carla. Bupkus walked up to her with a smile on his face. \"You better believe it Carla.\" he said wiggling his eyebrows, \"Because I got a special Christmas gift for you.\" The two of them got closer and kissed each other on the lips. \"Thanks for the gift, hunk muffin.\" she said smiling. \"Anytime, baby girl.\" Bupkus replied. \"Alright you guys,let's head to the living room to get this Christmas party started.\" said Pound. So the Monstars and Carla went to the living room were all their friends and neighbors are to let the party begin.[Chapter 13] Chapter:13 Three hours had past, and the Monstars' holiday house party was in full swing while everyone was having a good time. Most of their friends and neighbors danced to the music while some of them took a break from dancing to chill, talk, or to eat some of the snacks and drinks Bang prepared such as cupcakes, gingerbread cookies. Even the Monstars were having a good time as they danced to the music with all their friends. Later on, Bang wanted to show everyone his secret holiday project in the kitchen. \"Alright everyone!\" he shouted, \"I have something incredible to show all of you in the kitchen.\" All of their party guests including the rest of the Monstars stopped what they were doing after Blanko stopped the music and followed Bang to kitchen to show them his entire project. When they got there, their friends and neighbors saw something on a big round table was being covered by a large blue sheet. \"What is it you want to show us, Bang?\" asked Kenneth. \"I want to show you guys a secret Christmas project I completed.\" Bang replied, \"I've been working on this baby for hours.\" \"He's not wrong.\" said Bupkus, \"He started working on it since the day after Thanksgiving.\" \"Well,what are you waiting for son?\" asked Foghorn Leghorn, \"Let's see that Christmas project of yours.\" Bang grabbed the blue sheet covering his project on the big table. When he took it off, all of their friends gasped of suprised and couldn't believe their eyes when his project was revealed. It was an entire gingerbread village made out of gingerbread cookies, frosting, candy canes,chocolate, gumdrops, and other sweet treats. \"Well, what do guys think about my gingerbread village?\" Bang asked. Everyone was amazed how impressive his gingerbread village looked. \"Wow Bang, this looks incredible!\" said Bugs. \"That's a fine looking gingerbread village you made.\" said Yosemite Sam. \"What a fantastic gingerbread village.\" said Granny. \"I agree with the others.\" said Carla, This gingerbread village you made looks amazing!\" Bang smiled at the complements he received about his gingerbread village. \"Thanks everybody. It does look cool doesn't it?\" \"You can say that again.\" Daffy replied, \"Looks good enough to eat too.\" \"Alright everyone, let's head back to the living room and continue this party.\" Pound told the others.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14: Meanwhile in the living room, the Monstars and their friends continued to enjoy their holiday party while they eat their Christmas themed cookies and cupcakes with their drinks. \"Bang, these cookies and cupcakes you made are delicious!\" said Lola Bunny. \"Mmm, delicioso.\" said Speedy. When Wile finished eating, he licked some of the frosting off his lips and held up a signpost that said, \"Yummy!\" \"I'm glad you guys like the treats that I made.\" Bang said smiling. \"Well, let's remember that we shouldn't fill up on snack.\" said Pound. \"We're going to have our Christmas dinner soon.\" \"Well I'm gonna check on my gingerbread village first before I start cooking.\" said Bang, \"I'll be right back.\" But when Bang went back into the kitchen, he discovered something horrifying. His entire gingerbread was devoured by Daffy Duck. He was filled with anger and cleared his throat to get his attention. When Daffy was caught by Bang while chewing on the last pieces of his gingerbread village, he noticed how furious he was and smiled nervously.\" \"Hi Bang.\" Daffy replied nervously, \"I gotta tell you, these cook you made are too die for.\" Bang gave Daffy a sneaky smile and asked him, \"So Daffy, do you like my gingerbread village?\" Daffy gulped and started shaking when he knew something bad was going to happen to him. \"Y-yes\" he stuttered. \"Do you reeally like it?\" Bang asked again while grinding his teeth in rage. \"Yes.\" he responded with fright. \"Well I got a special treat for you.\" he said cracking his knuckles. Daffy gulped with fear and replied, \"What is it?\" Bang punched Daffy in the face an replied, \"That's my special treat for you.\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1 : It was a snowy afternoon and Christmas was only five days away and everyone in town was"},{"Movie":"Swing Kids","Title":"The Road to Paris","Author":"Joseph Haney","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4862931","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok so this idea was bouncing around in my head for a while and I finally decided to let it out. As the description says, this is the second part of a trilogy (\"Swing Kids\" was the first part) and is a cross over between the movies \"Swing Kids\" and \"Casablanca\" For those of you unfamiliar with the movie \"Casablanca\" I'll give you a crash course. The movie is set in the city of Casablanca in Morocco and focuses mainly on a café owner named Rick Blaine. He's a hard man, who \"sticks his neck out for nobody.\" That is, until Ilsa Lund, the girl he loved in Paris (before it fell to the Nazis) shows up—with her revolutionist husband, Czech Victor Lazlo. Basically that's all you need to know for now. The only aspects of that movie that are in play here are the characters of Victor and Ilsa, and some of the events in Paris. If you want to know more, rent the movie. It will come out more in the second part of this story. This story starts out a few weeks after Peter was arrested, and the majority takes place during the spring and early summer of 1940. Enjoy Chapter 1 The guard's whistle forced Peter from his sleep as it had for the past two weeks. Moaning slightly he turned over and got out of bed, shivering against the cold of the early morning. \"It is way too early for this,\" he thought as he fought to keep his eyes open. He stood up--and was promptly kicked in the head as the man who slept above him swung his legs over the edge of his bed. Peter shot him a look of disgust and made his way toward the door. As Peter trudged out of the bunkhouse with the other prisoners, he tried to hold on to the last fragments of his dream. He was back in Hamburg on a sunny summer day. He was walking with Evey and he saw his mother and Willy in the distance waving at him from the steps outside their building. He couldn't remember details, such as what he and Evey talked about, or what his mother was wearing, but it didn't matter. It was a happy dream and that was all that mattered. He was stirred from these thoughts as he was rushed along toward the convoy of trucks that were waiting to take them to the mines. As he fell in line with the rest of the prisoners, he tried to remember more of his dream. He didn't want to lose the feeling it had left him when he woke up. Before he could find the good feelings again, he bumped into the man in front of him. \"Watch where you're going!\" the man shouted. \"Bad enough I have to get walked over by the guards; I don't need it from you too.\" \"Sorry,\" Peter said quietly. \"I didn't mean to—\" \"Stop talking! Load up!\" One of the guards shouted, shoving Peter toward the nearest truck. Ten minutes later, as the truck began to roll out of the compound, Peter gave up trying to remember the dream. With a sigh he sat back, got as comfortable as possible, and cried himself back to sleep. Three hours later, Peter woke up. Whether it was from the truck screeching to a halt, or the guards yelling that actually did it, he wasn't sure. Either way it didn't matter. He quickly stood up and followed his fellow prisoners out of the truck. As soon as his feet hit the ground, a pick axe was forced into his hands and he was shoved toward the hole in the side of the mountain. Thus began another day of endless work. Peter had no idea what metal they were pulling out of this particular mine or what it was being made into in the factories, nor did he much care about any of that. He was simply determined to try to keep out of trouble and thus make his stay in this hell hole as bearable as possible. As he dumped a load of rock into the cart for the people down the line to sort out, a commotion erupted further down the tunnel. Peter and his fellow workers stopped working to see what was going on. It didn't take long for the situation to become obvious. Peter saw the man he had bumped into had thrown down his pick and had attacked a guard. The guard now had the man pinned down and was punching him at will. As the blows fell, Peter suddenly felt a surge of anger. Before he could think, he dropped his pick and rushed toward the men. He caught the guard by surprise and easily tackled him, knocking him off of the man, but the crash landing knocked the wind out of him. Before he could recover, the guard had pinned him down and was pressing his night stick onto his throat. Suddenly, Peter was back outside the Bismarck with Thomas. As he felt the life drain out of him, he saw Thomas laughing evilly as the life slowly left him. As he watched, the face melted into that of the guard, and with a last burst of strength, he drove his knee up as hard as he could. Then he could breathe again. As his eyes readjusted to the dim light of the mine, he saw a crowd of people gathered around staring in silence at him. He sat up and saw that the guard was lying on the ground next to him holding his crotch. It didn't take him long to figure out what had happened. He quickly stood up and looked for the first man the guard had been beating up. He saw him standing by the back wall. Their eyes met and Peter thought he saw a slight smile cross the man's face. Before he could ponder this, a shrill whistle filled the tunnel and the crowd quickly dispersed. Peter walked back to his pick axe and tried to act as though nothing had happened. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw shadows moving down the tunnel towards them. Great, he thought. The last thing I need is some Nazi officer to come down here and start asking questions. Sure enough, the Captain in charge of the camp was leading several men into the mine, at least one of whom was an officer of higher rank. And the first thing they saw was the guard who was finally starting to get up. End Chapter 1 Please rate and review[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Fortunately for Peter, the guard's pride kept him from telling the other guards what had happened to him. Unfortunately, it didn't stop the guard from making Peter's life miserable. Years later, when looking back on the next three months, Peter wasn't sure why the guard didn't shoot him. It wasn't like there would have been an inquiry into the death of a prisoner. But Peter wasn't one to dismiss good fortune, if you could call living through endless days of repeated abuse and torture, watching fellow prisoners die, and starving to death yourself good fortune. He saw very little of the man he had saved. He passed him on occasion while working, but never for more than a few seconds. At first Peter tried to get his attention, but after a while he gave up. Whoever the man was, he seemed to be avoiding him, which Peter could understand. The guards were constantly on the lookout for anything that might be evidence of a conspiracy among the prisoners, so the less contact the two of them had, the better it would be for both of them. So apart from the usual abuse, the next three months passed without event. Then out of the blue one day, the trucks didn't take them to the mines, but to a railroad crossing where a train was waiting. When Peter saw this, he began to feel uneasy. Unannounced changes in plans were never good in this world. The times Peter had seen the guards pull people out of the mines and load them onto the trucks before the day was over, the prisoners were never seen again. Peter wasn't given much time to dwell on this before the guards began to herd the prisoners toward the boxcars on the train. They crowded in as best they could, but trying to fit nearly a thousand prisoners into one boxcar was a lot to ask for. Peter, being one of the first prisoners into the car, was forced into the corner by the flood of bodies. When the car was as full as it was going to get, the guards closed the door. About an hour later (at least it felt like an hour; it could have been only five minutes) the train began to move. Peter, trying not to think about what was waiting when the train reached its destination, made himself as comfortable as possible. _____________________________________________________________________________________ The sudden wave of murmurs that began to surge throughout the crowded boxcar told Peter that something was happening, a fear that was confirmed when he felt the train lurch to a stop. He wasn't sure how long they had been in the car, but it felt like weeks. The men closest to the small windows were giving reports to the other prisoners. \"There's nothing out there, only trees,\" One of them said. \"We must be in some kind of forest.\" Another voice, from the other side of the car, said, \"I see nothing but trees also. And also the sun is setting.\" \"Why do you think we've stopped?\" someone asked. Peter had his suspicions, but he didn't dare say them out loud for fear that they would come true. Apparently everyone else felt the same way, because no one said anything. A few minutes later, the door on the boxcar was opened, and a voice said, \"Everybody out. Five minutes to stretch your legs.\" Peter looked around the car as about half of the men moved toward the door—and the other half stayed in place, dead. It was all Peter could do to keep from throwing up right then and there. As soon as his feet touched the ground he ran for the forest and ducked behind the nearest tree. As he leaned against the tree, trying to catch his breath, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He spun around—and saw that it was the man whose life he had saved in the minds three months earlier. \"You—, \"Peter began, but the man clamped his hand over his mouth and leaned in close, his beard tickling the side of Peter's face. \"If you want to live,\" he whispered, \"follow me.\" Peter hesitated, not sure what the man was planning to do. But, he decided, that whatever it was, it was a better fate than the guards had prepared for him. He nodded and the man removed his hand from his mouth. \"Okay,\" the man said, glancing around. \"Follow me, and stay low.\" Having grown up in the city, Peter had never cared much for nature. But with the sun still in the sky, he was grateful for the thickness of the forest as the two of them crept along from tree to tree. Suddenly, the sounds of machine guns filled the forest. Peter turned to look, but the man grabbed his arm. \"There's nothing you can do for them,\" he said. \"Keep moving.\" Peter nodded and pushed through the forest after him. After about five minutes the guns stopped. The silence was overwhelming. So much so that when Peter stepped on a twig, the snap seemed to echo forever. The man froze and motioned for Peter to do the same. It wasn't long before he could hear the guards moving through the woods toward them. Peter glanced at the man and he motioned for him to stay still. As the guards got closer, it was all he could do to keep himself from making a break for it. He kept his eyes on the man, waiting for a signal of some kind. Then as suddenly as the machine gun fire had started, the guard movement stopped. The man raised his eyebrows in confusion. He motioned at Peter to stay down and he slowly stood and peeked around the tree. There was silence for a few seconds—and then a short burst of machine gun fire ripped into the tree. Peter heard the guard running toward them. As he rounded the tree, the man punched him in the face. The guard dropped like a rock. \"Well that ought to take care of him,\" the man said. Just then they heard the rest of the guards running toward them. \"Run!\" the man shouted as he took off into the woods. Peter didn't hesitate and as he ran after the man, he heard the guards shouting commands to each other. Peter tried to keep up with the man, but that was easier said than done. He hadn't gone on hundred yards yet and he felt as though his lungs were going to burst at any minute. His only saving grace was that he had a head start. After climbing a particularly tall hill, though, he was ready to stop running and surrender his fate to the fancy of the guards. Then, as though fate had other plans for him, he tripped and tumbled down the steep far side of the hill. Peter gasped as the air was knocked out of him. It took several minutes of deep breaths to get enough air back in his lungs to allow him to move again. He stood slowly and saw a cave about 50 yards away. Slowly, he began to make his way toward the cave. He hadn't realized how weak he really was, but that run, though brief, combined with the fall, had drained him of most of his energy. When he reached the cave, he crawled in and as soon as he was back as far as he could go, he lay down. The last thing he thought before he gave into exhaustion was, I wonder where that man went.[Chapter 3] Author's note: OK, I really want some feed back on this, so until I get a review from someone other than SwingGirlAtHeart (who is still welcome to put her two cents in), I'm not going to update this story. I'd prefer something a little deeper than \"Good job, keep it up\" so say what you liked (or didn't, I can take criticism). And until further notice, this will apply to all future chapters. And on with the show... Chapter 3 When Peter awoke he noticed two things at the same time. The first thing was that he was laying on something soft. The second was that his chest hurt. He propped himself up on his elbows to get a better view of the room. It wasn't easy. The pain in his chest got worse when he moved. Looking around he saw that he was no longer in the cave. He was on some sort of bed in a small room. The only furniture in the room, apart from the bed, was a small table next to the bed with a burning candle on it, and a chair in the corner. The man who had saved his life was sleeping in the chair. He was no longer in the thin gray shirt and pants that comprised the prisoner's uniform, but instead he was in a brown suit. From the little light that the candle gave off, Peter could see a closed door beside the man. Where am I? he wondered. He felt his chest, trying to determine why it hurt. Wincing in pain, he realized that the fall had done more than just knock the wind out of him. It also cracked a rib or two. Great, he thought. Just what a man on the run needs. A sudden noise from the corner where the man was stirred him from these thoughts. He raised his head slightly and saw that the man was awake. A smile crept across the man's face as he saw Peter was awake as well. \"You gave me quite a scare when we lost each other in the woods. It was only by pure luck that I saw you duck into that cave. I had stopped to catch my breath and I saw you fall. I wasn't sure you were going to make it to the cave, you were stumbling so much.\" \"Where am I?\" Peter asked. \"In a friend's house,\" the man replied. \"He helped me bring you here. That was nearly two days ago.\" \"Two days?\" Peter said, surprised. \"I must have been more exhausted than I thought.\" \"That doesn't surprise me. I've spent more time asleep than awake since I've been here. My name's Victor, by the way. Victor Laszlo.\" \"Peter Müller,\" Peter replied. \"I'd offer you my hand, but it hurts to move.\" \"Well, you cracked at least two ribs, so I understand that. You probably won't be in any shape to travel for a few days.\" \"You look fine,\" Peter said. \"What's keeping you here?\" After a brief pause, Victor said, \"Well, with the Nazis combing the area looking for us, I figured it was best to lay low for a few days. Besides, I wanted to make sure you were okay.\" Peter nodded. \"I guess I owe you for saving my life.\" Victor shook his head. \"I wouldn't have been around to do it if you hadn't stepped in with that guard a few months ago. We're even.\" Peter smiled. \"I guess we are.\" Just then, the door opened and a girl, who Peter guessed was about twelve or thirteen, came in carrying a tray of food. When she saw Peter, she said, \"Oh, you're awake. I'll tell mother to fix you something to eat.\" She handed the tray to Victor and hurried out of the room forgetting to close the door behind her. Through it, Peter saw shelves full of jars of food. The cellar, he realized. It was then that Peter realized just how hungry he was. As Victor stood to close the door, Peter sat up, wincing at the pain in his chest. The two men sat in silence for a few minutes until the girl came back with a bowl of soup for Peter. After she left, Victor broke the silence. \"Don't try to eat all of that at once or you'll make yourself sick. Take it slow.\" After nearly three months on scarce portions of moldy bread and dirty water, the soup was like manna from heaven. Peter was tempted to dive in and drain the bowl, but he could sense that Victor was right. So he slowly took a small spoonful and ate it. They ate in silence for a few minutes before Victor again spoke. \"So, Peter, do you have any idea as to where you're going?\" Peter set the bowl of soup on the table next to the bed. \"No,\" he said. \"I hadn't even thought about where I might go if I escaped from the camp, as it seemed so unlikely. All I know is that I can't go back home.\" \"And where is that?\" \"Hamburg. It's in the north, about a two day trip from Berlin.\" Victor nodded. \"I know how you feel. I, too, cannot return to my home in Prague.\" \"You're Czech?\" Peter asked in surprise \"Yes. I was taken as far away from the underground movement I was leading as the Nazis could manage. Why they just didn't kill me, I'll never know.\" \"Where are you going to go now?\" \"Paris. I have friends there who can help me get out of Europe and on to America, where I can continue my work against the Nazis. You are welcome to join me, since you have no plans of your own.\" Peter didn't respond right away. He had not expected this man to be so willing to help him now, since, by his own admission, they no longer owed each other anything. On the other hand, Peter thought, I don't have anywhere else to go. I can't go back to Hamburg, and I've never been outside of Germany before, so I don't know anybody else who can help me. Victor seemed to sense what he was thinking. He stopped eating and said, \"You don't have to decide right now. It will be a few days before I leave, so you can think it over.\" With that he stood, picked up his tray and Peter's bowl, and left Peter to think over his proposition. ********************************************************************************* When Victor returned two hours later, Peter had made up his mind. \"I'll go with you to Paris, but I don't want any part of the movement,\" he said with conviction. Victor looked a little disappointed, but he nodded. \"Get some rest, then,\" he said. \"We'll be leaving in three days.\" He helped Peter lay down and blew out the candle. It wasn't long before the two of them were asleep again.[Chapter 4] It actually took five days for Peter to heal to the point that he was able to travel. Though he didn't say anything, Peter sensed that the delay annoyed Victor, as though he had a schedule to keep. But since he didn't complain, Peter wasn't going to bring it up. Once he was ready, and fitted with a suit that was at least two sizes too big, they set off toward Paris The days mostly passed without event. They passed most of the time in silence. Every now and then, Victor would ask Peter a question about his life before the camp. His questions focused mainly on his father and Peter answered them the best he could. When he wasn't asking about Peter's father, Victor taught Peter some simple French phrases that would be useful in case they got separated before they got to Paris. Victor offered little information about himself, and Peter was hesitant to ask for it. He wouldn't even say where they were headed. Fortunately their travel wasn't hindered by the Nazis, mostly because they avoided towns whenever possible and traveled at night when they neared towns and villages. Peter never complained. Whenever he thought he might start, he remembered the conditions of the camp. No matter what he thought of being on the run, it was better than dying in that place. After nearly four weeks of foraging for food and freezing half to death at night, however, Peter wasn't sure how much more he could take. He wasn't sure which he hated more: The cold or the silence. When your travelling companion doesn't say much, he can be very dull company indeed. He hoped against hope for just one night with other people. One night, his prayers were answered. After one particularly grueling day of travel, the two of them found themselves standing in a clearing behind a farmhouse. When he saw it, Victor breathed a sigh of relief and hurried to the front door without a word. Peter hurried after him, wondering why the man was so excited. When he reached the door, Victor knocked three times and then waited for a reply. After a minute, Peter heard someone on the other side of the door knock four times. Victor answered with two slow knocks. Then Peter heard the scraping of a key in the lock and the door swung open, revealing a young woman holding a candle. After Victor identified himself and Peter, she quickly ushered them inside and, after checking to make sure they weren't followed, closed the door and locked it behind her. She then turned and walked down the dimly lit hallway with two doors on each side and a large room at the end. Peter glanced at Victor who quickly followed her. Questions flooded Peter's mind, but something kept him from asking them. When they reached the end of the hall, Peter saw that the main part of the house was brightly lit by a fire in a large stone fireplace. The room was decorated sparingly, with only a few photos sitting on the mantel piece. There were two large chairs facing the fire place, where a man stood, smoking on a pipe. He appeared to be several years younger than Victor, but Peter knew that Victor looked older than he actually was due to his time in the camp. The woman spoke first. \"Franz, this is Victor Laszlo and Peter Müller,\" she said in a low voice. \"Victor I know,\" Franz replied. \"But you, young man,\" he said looking at Peter. \"You I do not know.\" \"He is a friend of mine,\" Victor said. \"He saved my life in the camp and I am returning the favor.\" Franz looked cautiously from one man to the other. \"Is this true, son?\" he finally asked Peter. \"Yes, sir,\" Peter said. \"I saved his life and now he is saving mine by helping me get out of the country.\" Franz nodded and smiled. \"In that case, you are most welcome. Any friend of Victor's is a friend of mine and will have a place at my table. Set two more places for dinner, Hilda. Mr. Laszlo and his friend will be joining us.\" The woman nodded and hurried off to the kitchen. Franz then motioned for Victor and Peter to sit down and had them tell him the story of their escape. They had just finished when Hilda stuck her head into the room and announced that dinner was ready. The men stood and Franz led the way into the kitchen. The first thing Peter noticed was that the kitchen was almost as empty as the dining room when it came to homey touches. The second thing he noticed was that there were six places set at the table. He wondered who else was coming. \"I did not know you were expecting company,\" Victor said, voicing Peter's question. \"Otherwise we would not have stopped by.\" \"Oh, I forgot to mention that you are not our only guests. We have two others staying with us tonight as well.\" Before Victor could inquire further, a voice from the doorway screamed, \"Peter!\" Peter barely had time to turn around when he found himself on the receiving end of a rather passionate embrace. When he was able to break free and get a good look at the person hugging him, his heart leapt higher than it had been in almost a year. \"Evey?\" he asked, trying to make sure he wasn't dreaming. \"Is it really you?\" \"Yes it is,\" she said, hugging him again. This time, fighting back tears, he returned the favor. \"We've been so worried about you,\" she said after a minute. \"We?\" Peter asked. Just then from the doorway he heard someone whistle a tune he thought he would never hear again. It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing. Looking away from Evey for the first time, he saw a young man standing in the doorway. Thomas Berger looked the same as the last time Peter had seen him, only he was wearing civilian clothes instead of an HJ uniform. \"Swing Heil, Peter,\" the blonde youth said with a grin. _____________________________________________________________ Okay, so same rule—until someone other than SwingGrilAtHeart leaves a review I'm not updating this story. SO PLEASE REVIEW!!![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 A million questions entered Peter's head at once and he was ready to ask them all when Franz said, \"There will be plenty of time for the three of you to catch up after dinner. Please, let's eat.\" Peter ate as quickly as he thought he could get away with, but dinner still seemed to take forever. The conversation was mostly just small talk. Peter tried to listen for hints about what was happening in Hamburg, but didn't receive any. When dinner was finally over, Franz asked Hilda to clear the table and then asked Victor to join him in the living room. Taking their cue from him, Thomas, Peter, and Evey left as well. Peter followed his friends down the hall to a spare bedroom. Once they were inside and Thomas had closed the door, Peter began asking questions. \"How are mother and Willi? What's been happening in Hamburg? Where's Otto?\" \"Willi and your mother are fine, Peter,\" Evey said as she sat down on the nearest bed. \"At least they were as of a month ago when we saw them last,\" Thomas added. \"But what's been happening? I haven't heard any news since I was taken to the prison camp.\" \"War,\" Thomas said. \"That's what's been happening. Britain and France are in it now. And Hitler is preparing to march on them the way he marched on Poland last September. They could be the next additions to Hitler's empire.\" \"That must be why Victor is in such a hurry to get to Paris,\" Peter said. \"He wants to reach it before the Nazis do.\" \"So do we,\" Evey said. \"From Paris, we can get to England or America.\" \"But what are you doing on the run?\" Peter asked, looking from Evey to Thomas. \"I thought you at least were safe, Thomas, being a member of the HJ.\" \"I probably was a little safer than most,\" Thomas said with a thoughtful smile. \"But no one is above the scrutiny of the Nazis. You should know that.\" \"You see, Peter,\" Evey said, \"After you left, it wasn't enough to be a swing kid anymore. At least it wasn't for us. Otto was happy with it. Perhaps if I had left him alone he'd still be alive.\" \"You don't know that\" Thomas said. \"Wait, Otto's dead?\" He slowly sat down on the bed next to Evey. \"How? When?\" \"We were getting to that,\" Thomas said. \"After you were taken away, Evey got it into her head that thumbing her nose at the Nazis behind their backs wasn't good enough. She wanted to take the fight to them. With some help from Helga, Arvid's girlfriend, she managed to convince Otto to join the cause.\" \"What cause?\" \"The resistance movement,\" Evey said. \"Our world was turning upside down and it wasn't enough to just listen to some records and sneak out at night to go dancing. I got it in my head that we—Otto, Helga, and I—could bring down the Nazis on our own. I even talked Thomas into helping.\" \"Yeah, I helped alright. I passed along the limited amount of information they allowed me to see and all it did was lead them to you. It was by sheer luck that we made it out. If I hadn't overheard Herr Knopp planning the raid you would have been sent to the camps for sure. Of course,\" he said looking pointedly at Evey, \"given your zeal, you probably would have gotten yourself shot for attacking someone in the Gestapo.\" Evey rolled her eyes. \"Anyway, one night about three weeks ago as I was getting ready to go to the meeting, Thomas came bursting into my house. When he told me that the Gestapo were planning a city wide operation to crush the movement, I knew I had gotten in over my head. They had somehow learned the names of all of the members of the resistance and they were going to round them all up and send them to the camps. I told my family to leave the city and I hurried out the door. We got to Otto in time, but when we got to Helga's house the Gestapo was already there. Needless to say we didn't stick around.\" \"What happened then?\" Peter asked. \"Well,\" Thomas said, sitting down next to Peter, \"we spent the next two hours running around Hamburg telling any member of the resistance we could find to get out of Hamburg. Otto and I finally convinced Evey that we needed to get out of the city as well. It wasn't easy. As part of his operation, Herr Knopp had the HJ standing guard at the exits to the city. We tried to sneak past them but we got caught. We tried to run, and they opened fire. Evey and I obviously made it. But Otto wasn't so lucky.\" Peter couldn't believe it. First his father, then Arvid, and now Otto. It seemed that the Nazis were determined to take away all of the people he cared about one at a time. After a moment, he asked, \"How did you find this place? I wouldn't have known about it without Victor.\" \"Hilda's brother was one of the members of the resistance in Berlin,\" Evey explained. \"He came to Hamburg to speak that night. When we told him about the raid, he told us to make our way south to his sister's cabin. She's helping smuggle refugees out of Germany. He said he'd meet us here in a few weeks, but we've been here nearly two weeks and he hasn't shown up.\" \"But now that you're here,\" Thomas said, grinning and clapping Peter on the shoulder, \"we can head to Paris together.\" Peter looked at Thomas and couldn't help but grin himself. \"Why not? I'll tell Victor tomorrow, and we should be able to leave the day after tomorrow.\" \"Absolutely not,\" a voice said from the doorway. Victor Laszlo strolled into the room. \"I will not allow my plans to be slowed down by the addition of two adolescents.\" \"Excuse me?\" Thomas said, standing up. \"I'll have you know—, \"he began but Peter grabbed his arm. \"Let me handle this,\" he said, standing and pushing past Thomas. \"Why can't they come along?\" \"Because two extra people will slow us down, no matter whose friends they are.\" \"What is the hurry anyway?\" Peter asked. \"Paris will still be there whether we make it in two weeks or two months. You have been pushing me to the brink of exhaustion every day for almost a month, and you have offered nothing that would make the journey go any easier. And now that I have found something that will make it go by easier and you tell me that they can't come with us.\" \"Well if that's your concern,\" Victor said, his voice rising, \"then by all means let us part company here and now. And as to my hurry, in case your friends haven't told you, there is a very real possibility that Paris could fall to the Nazis as early as next month. Forgive me for wanting to get there before then.\" With that, he turned and started to walk out of the room. \"Wait a minute,\" Peter called after him. \"Are you trying to tell me that you knew about the Nazis marching on France the whole time? I just found out tonight.\" \"And we didn't hear about it until last week,\" Thomas said. \"So I want to know where you heard about the Nazi's plans?\" Peter asked Victor froze in the doorway. After a minute he turned and said, \"I need to get to Paris as soon as possible. My reasons are my own. I apologize for my outburst. Peter, I promise I will think about letting your friends come along. I will let you know tomorrow. Good night.\" With that, he turned and walked out of the room. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Remember, O loyal readers, someone other than SwingGrilAtHeart must review in order for this story to be updated.[Chapter 6] Peter walked into the kitchen thennext morning, still wearing his traveling clothes, having gotten intonthe habit of sleeping in them. Victor, also in his travel clothes,nwas sitting at the table, whispering to Franz. The two men quicklynstopped talking and pretended as though nothing was going on. \"Please,\" Peter said, grabbing anmug from the table and filling it with coffee. \"Don't stopntalking on my account. Unless, of course, you were talking on mynaccount. Would you like me to leave so you two can finish?\" \"That won't be necessary,\"nVictor said. \"I want to apologize for my outburst last night. Inguess I'm under more stress than I realized. Your friends can comenwith us to Paris.\" Peter looked from one man to thenother. \"Great. I'm sure Evey and Thomas will be happy to hearnit.\" Draining the cup, he sat it on the table and turn to leave. \"Peter,\" Victor called afternhim. Peter turned in the doorway and leaned against the frame,nstaring at the two men. Victor took a deep breath and continued. n\"How well do you trust Thomas Berger?\" Peter hesitated. He hadn't reallyngiven it any thought. He hadn't seen Thomas in nearly six monthsnand their last meeting had ended with Thomas nearly strangling him innan alleyway. But he had helped Evey and Otto escape rather thannrounding them up with the others. And when they were cornered by thenHJ, he had run rather than turning them over, which he easily couldnhave done and saved his own skin. Seeing his hesitation, Victor said,n\"The reason I ask is that it has come to my attention that he was anmember of the Hitler-Jugend in Hamburg.\" Peter couldn't help but smile. n\"If that's your reason for distrusting him, I feel it only fairnto tell you that I was a member of the HJ as well.\" He then wentnon to tell the story about how he and Thomas had wound up in thenHJ—and about their falling out, ending with that night outside thenBismarck. Victor and Franz exchanged surprisednglances. Victor quickly recovered. \"Conformists don't get sentnto the camps, Peter.\" Peter walked over to the table. n\"Conformists don't end up on the run, either,\" he said with angrin. Victor nodded. \"True, but younstill haven't answered the question. Do you trust Thomas Berger?\" Peter sat down and looked Victorndirectly in the eye. \"If Thomas was still a believer, why didn'tnhe turn Evey in when he had the chance? Why did he decide to go onnthe run with her?\" \"Maybe because he hoped she wouldnlead him to more substantial members of the resistance.\" \"Like you, I suppose?\" Peternasked, leaning closer. \"That sounds a little paranoid to me. Isnit really so hard for you to trust people at face value?\" \"I've been betrayed too manyntimes for me to trust everyone I meet the first time I meet them,\"nVictor snapped \"You trusted me,\" Peter said. n\"You could have left me to die in that forest, but you didn't. nYou went to the trouble to save my life. How is that different fromnthis?\" Victor took a deep breath, andndidn't say anything else. Standing, Peter said, \"In answer tonyour original question, I trust Thomas with my life, and with Evey's,nand with yours if it would ever come to that. That's what friendsndo. They trust each other.\" When Victor remained silent, Peternturned to leave adding , \"I'll tell Evey and Thomas you'venchanged your mind.\" Suddenly there was a knock at thendoor. Peter stopped and turned back to Victor and Franz. Franznstood and walked to the window. After a quick glance out the window,nhe turned and nodded to Victor, who jumped up and hurried out of thenkitchen. Franz turned to Peter and whispered, \"Get your friendsnand hurry to the back room. Go down to the cellar and all the way innthe back is a door. Behind the door is a tunnel that will take younin to the woods. Hurry.\" \"Who's at the door?\" Peternasked. \"Two members of the localnGestapo,\" was Franz's answer. Without a second thought, Peternturned and sprinted down the hall after Victor, toward the room wherenhe, Thomas, and Evey had spent the night while Victor turned into thenroom across the hall. When he burst in, Thomas was just pulling hisnshoes on and Evey hadn't woken up yet. Thank God they learnednhow to sleep in their clothes , Peter thought. \"What's going on?\" Thomasnasked, seeing the look on Peter's face. Peter didn't answer, butnhurried over to Evey's bed and started shaking her. \"Come on,nEvey. We've got to go,\" he said as calmly as he could. \"Peter, what's going on?\"nThomas asked as Evey started to wake up. Peter looked up. \"The Gestapo'snat the door.\" \"What?\" Evey said, suddenly widenawake. \"How did they find us?\" she said as she grabbed her shoesnand began putting them on. \"I think they've come fornVictor,\" Peter said. \"But we've all got to get out of here,nnow.\" \"I agree,\" Thomas said. \"Indon't suppose someone has a plan on how that is going to happen?\" \"Franz said that there's antunnel in the cellar that will take us into the woods. Victor'snalready over there. Let's go.\" \"It doesn't seem like yournfriend Victor has much choice about whether or not we go with himnnow,\" Evey said, standing. \"Then I guess it's a good thingnhe changed his mind,\" Peter said, checking to make sure the hallwaynwas clear. The three of them hurried across thenhall. Victor and Franz were moving the rug that hid the trapdoor. nPeter and Thomas quickly began to help. Once the trapdoor wasnuncovered, Thomas, who was closest to the door, grabbed the handlenand pulled it open. Franz took a deep breath. \"Hildanand I will stall them as best we can. If you hurry, you should makenit.\" \"I seriously doubt that,\" said anvoice from behind them. Just before he turned around, Peter saw thenlook of shock on Franz's face, and he knew who it was. Hilda stoodnin the doorway, pointing a pistol at them.[Chapter 7] \"Hilda…\" Franz said, his voice breaking. \"Shut up, you traitor,\" she snapped. \"What's going on?\" Peter whispered to Thomas. \"I thought you said she was a member of the resistance.\" \"I thought she was,\" Thomas said. \"That's what her brother said when we told him to get out of Hamburg.\" \"My brother,\" Hilda interrupted, \"was a very well placed spy, like me. How do you think the Gestapo learned the names of the members of the resistance in Hamburg?\" \"How could you?\" Franz said, looking like a dog whose master had just turned on him. \"How could I ?\" she screamed. \"How could you ? How could you betray our Führer?\" \"Because that man is the biggest threat to the world since the plague!\" Victor said, his voice full of defiance. \"Hear, hear!\" Thomas shouted, causing Hilda to slap him across the face. \"I will shoot the next one of you who speaks. Now move.\" She stood aside and motioned for them to walk out of the room. Peter exchanged a quick glance with the others and then, with a last glare at Hilda, led the way out of the room and down the hall. When they reached the door, Hilda called to the men on the other side, \"I have the traitors. We're coming out.\" Taking a deep breath, Peter pulled the door open and walked out. Waiting for them were two cars and almost a dozen Gestapo armed with machine guns. \"Well this is quite a reception you've lined up for us,\" Victor said. \"I'm flattered.\" \"Shut up,\" Hilda snapped as she pushed past them and motioned them off of the front porch. \"Watch them,\" she said to the two nearest Gestapo. She then walked over to the cars and began talking to a man whom Peter assumed to be the commander of this particular goon squad. Peter quickly did the math in his head. Franz probably wasn't going to be much help, and while he knew Evey would be more than willing to help in a fight, he didn't think she would be much help against the armed men waiting for them. That left Thomas, Victor, and himself. No matter how many different ways he figured it, he did not like the way the scenarios played themselves out. On the other hand, he wasn't too thrilled about the alternative either. \"I don't suppose you have a plan,\" Thomas whispered to Peter. \"I have several plans, each one crazier than the last, and all of them end badly for us.\" \"Just follow my lead,\" Victor said. He then side-stepped over to Evey and began to whisper in her ear. \"Follow his lead?\" Thomas asked. \"Sure. I escaped the camps by following his lead. Besides, in order for any escape plan to work, we'll have to work together.\" \"Stop talking!\" Hilda snapped as she approached them again. She then shoved Thomas, Evey and him toward the nearest car. Victor and Franz were shoved to the other car. \"Wait!\" Evey said. \"Where are you taking us?\" \"You and your friends will be taken to one of the camps,\" Hilda said as she opened the car door. \"No!\" Evey screamed. She then fell to the ground. \"I can't go to the camps! Please don't send me there!\" \"Fine,\" Hilda said. \"I'll just shoot you here.\" She pulled out her pistol and pointed it at Evey. \"No!\" Thomas shouted. He lunged forward, but one of the Gestapo grabbed him and forced him back against the car. Peter quickly glanced over at Victor, looking for some kind of cue. When he managed to get Victor's attention, the older man nodded. He then turned and punched the nearest guard in the face. \"NOW!\" Peter shouted, resulting in three things happening at once. First, Evey sprang up and tackled Hilda causing her to drop the pistol. Second, Peter punched his guard in the face and dove for the pistol. Third, Thomas drove his knee into the gut of the man holding him against the car. As Peter grabbed for the pistol, someone kicked him in the stomach, knocking him to the side. As his eyes focused again, he found himself staring down the barrel of the machine-gun of the guard he had just hit. He closed his eyes as a burst of gunfire filled the air. When nothing happened to him, he opened his eyes and saw that the man was now dead on the ground. He looked around and saw Thomas holding his guard's machine gun. Turning his attention to the second car, Peter saw that Franz was being more helpful than he had thought, but he and Victor were struggling against the five men who had been guarding them. As he stood, he noticed three men running toward them. Thomas apparently saw them too, because he turned the machine-gun on them and opened fire. When he was finished, Thomas and Peter ran over to help Franz and Victor. Peter pulled one of the men off of Victor and quickly punched him in the face. The guard's response was immediate—a hard right-cross that knocked Peter to the ground. He quickly jumped up and punched the guard in the stomach and then in the chin. He then grabbed the night-stick from the man's belt and, swinging it as hard as he could, hit the man over the head, bringing him to his knees. Another blow to the head knocked the guard unconscious. When he turned, he saw that the others had taken care of the other four men. It was at that moment that Peter remembered Evey and he hurried over to the first car where she was kneeling next to Hilda's unconscious body. \"Are you OK?\" he asked as he knelt beside her. \"I think so,\" she said, wiping tears from her eyes. \"I've just never gotten into an actual fight with anyone before. It's kind of scary.\" \"It can be,\" Peter said with a smile. \"Especially if the person you're fighting has a gun and you don't.\" \"That's true, but it makes the victory that much more satisfying,\" Thomas said as he walked over and offered his hands. Peter and Evey took them and he helped them to her feet as Victor and Franz walked over. \"Well, they're all taken care of,\" Victor said. \"I suggest we get out of here before their reinforcements arrive.\" \"Agreed,\" Peter said. \"How long do you think we have?\" \"Two hours, three at the most.\" \"Then let's get going. Franz, are you coming with us?\" \"I'm afraid not,\" Franz said. \"I can do more good here in Germany than in France, so I'm going to Berlin to join the resistance there.\" \"Are you sure?\" Evey asked. \"The Gestapo must know your face by now.\" \"Yes,\" Franz said with a smile. \"I plan to take on a more discrete position within the resistance. With any luck, I'll keep my face away from the Nazis and their cursed work camps.\" \"In that case, my friend,\" Victor said, offering him his hand, \"good luck.\" Then, following a quick exchange of hand-shakes and good-byes, they parted ways. Victor, Thomas, Peter, and Evey turned toward the west, while Franz headed to the north-east.[Chapter 8] They were travelling for three days before Victor decided to stop for a full night. After finding a barn to spend the night in, he assigned each of them two hour watches and, taking the first for himself, told Peter, Thomas, and Evey to get some sleep. Peter, having gotten used to sleeping under such conditions fell asleep quickly. Thomas fell asleep about an hour later, but kept tossing and turning. Evey on the other hand couldn't fall asleep at all. She lay on the floor staring up toward the roof of the barn for a little over an hour before she decided she had had enough. She slowly stood up and, after making sure that Peter and Thomas were asleep, she made her way over toward the door where Victor was sitting, keeping watch. \"Couldn't sleep?\" Victor asked as she approached, not taking his eyes off the road that ran near the barn. \"I'm not used to sleeping in these kinds of conditions,\" she said, sitting down next to him. \"Well, you'd better get used to it. You won't see another decent bed for a while.\" \"I know, but, for tonight, I guess I'd prefer to stay awake for a little while longer.\" \"You should get some sleep. Thomas will wake you for your watch.\" \"We traded shifts. I'll go after you and he'll go after me.\" \"Is that what you came over here to tell me? That the two of you had switched shifts?\" \"No,\" Evey said with a smile. \"I just thought you could use some company.\" Victor turned to her and she could tell that he was about to say no, but when their eyes met, she saw something change in them. He sighed and smiled slightly. \"I would like some company. Thank you.\" They sat in silence for a few minutes before Evey said, \"Can I ask you something?\" \"You can, but I can't promise you an answer.\" \"Why did you save Peter?\" Victor looked at her in surprise. \"I thought that you and he were friends?\" \"We are,\" Evey said quickly. \"I didn't mean it like that. I'm grateful. But you were ready to leave Thomas and me behind at Franz' house, saying that we would slow you down. I want to know what it was about Peter that made you want to save him from the camps and take him with you.\" Victor was quiet for several minutes which caused Evey to wonder if she had crossed some kind of line. Finally, though, Victor answered. \"I helped him escape the camp because he saved my life. As for taking him to Paris, I don't know. I suppose I saw some hope for him in the resistance, even though he says he wants nothing to do with it. And I suppose he reminds me a little of myself when I was younger.\" \"Is that all?\" \"I'm sorry that it's not deeper than that,\" Victor said barely containing the sarcasm. \"I don't fully understand why I'm doing this for the three of you. Every instinct I have tells me I shouldn't trust anyone and yet I trust Peter in a way I have trusted very few people. And his trust for you and Thomas has rubbed off on me.\" \"That's Peter. He inspires something in people, something that they've never felt in themselves before.\" \"So do the Nazis,\" Victor said sharply. Evey simply nodded in agreement, thinking of Thomas, and they lapsed into silence again. After a few minutes, Victor broke the silence with a question of his own. \"What did Peter inspire in you?\" \"What makes you say that?\" Evey asked surprised. \"The way you said that he inspires people. You sounded as though you were talking from experience.\" Evey considered this and had to agree. \"Before I met Peter, I never thought much about the Nazis and their purging of outside influences on the children of Germany. Peter introduced me to the world of the Swing Kids. That's how my rebellion started.\" \"What are the 'Swing Kids'?\" \"They were—are—a group of teenagers that wear British clothes and sneak off to clubs to listen and dance to American swing music.\" Catching the skeptical look on Victor's face, she smiled. \"I know it's not much of a rebellion, but it had the Gestapo scared. Any Swing Kid who got caught was forced to join the Hitler-Jugend—or was sent to the camps.\" \"Yes, Peter told me his story. It's not so different from the many stories I've heard. The Nazis seem to make a habit of finding rebellion everywhere they look.\" \"How did you get sent to the camp?\" Evey asked. Victor looked at her in surprise. \"That's a little bold isn't it?\" \"Maybe, but no bolder than you asking me what Peter inspired in me.\" \"Fair enough,\" Victor said with a smile. \"I was the leader of the resistance in Czechoslovakia before the Nazis caught me. I don't know why they didn't just kill me, but I'm not going to question it. Since my face is practically engrained in the minds of all of the Nazis, I can't stay in Europe. That's why I need to get to Paris.\" \"Why Paris?\" Evey asked Victor was caught off-guard. \"I just told you,\" he said. \"No, you told me why you need to get out of Europe. What you didn't tell me was why Paris is the only place you can go. Surely Hilda told the Gestapo that you were heading to Paris, so why are you still taking that risk? Why haven't you changed your plans?\" Victor was speechless. Evey realized that he had not even considered this development and the danger it placed them in. She knew that she had to make him change his plans, or at least explain why he hadn't. She pressed on. \"Why can't we go to Belgium or The Netherlands? The resistance movements there will be more than happy to help you. Or if you insist on going to France, why can't we go to some other city? What's in Paris that's so important?\" Victor finally found his voice. \"It's not a what . It's a who. \" Evey suddenly understood. \"What's her name?\" \"Ilsa. Her name is Ilsa. She's…she's special.\" Evey nodded. \"Let me ask you something, Victor. If Peter had wanted to come back to Hamburg for me, would you have let him risk his life like that?\" Victor just stared out at the road. After a few minutes of silence, Evey said \"I didn't think so.\" They sat in silence for another hour before Victor stood and said, \"Keep an eye on the road, and wake Thomas in two hours or so.\" Evey nodded and watched as Victor walked toward where Thomas and Peter were sleeping in the hay.[Chapter 9] When Peter awoke the next morning, he noticed that the others were in the corner locked in what looked like a heated debate. Evey and Victor seemed to be arguing about something while Thomas seemed to be trying to mediate—and failing. \"What's going on?\" he asked as he approached the group. \"Evey insists that going to Paris is dangerous, while Viktor claims that it's the only way to get out of Europe,\" Thomas said \"And what do you think?\" \"I don't know. Without knowing what's going on out there, I don't want to make a decision.\" \"Fair enough,\" Peter said. He then placed himself between Evey and Viktor and managed to quiet them. \"Thomas has told me what's going on here, and I have a suggestion that may help resolve this.\" \"What is it?\" Evey asked. \"One of us goes into the nearest town and finds out what's going on. We decide from there.\" No one said anything at first. After a minute, Victor smiled. \"I seem to be losing my touch. There was a time when that solution would have been obvious to me.\" Turning to Evey he asked, \"Do you have any serious objections to this idea?\" \"No,\" Evey said. \"Then we'd better get moving,\" Victor said. \"We don't know when we will reach the next town.\" They quickly left the barn and hurried down the road. They reached the nearest town three hours later. Looking from the forest that overlooked the town, Victor assessed the situation. \"Well, there doesn't seem to be any Gestapo here. Still, we should be cautious when we go into town.\" \"I don't think we should all go,\" Thomas said. \"It increases the risk, especially if you join us.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that you are the biggest risk we have. You're a wanted man. It's likely that everyone in that town knows someone who knows your face. You should remain here.\" Victor considered this for a moment. \"You're right. In fact only one or two of you should go. I don't suppose any of you want to volunteer?\" Peter spoke up first. \"I'll go.\" \"I'll join you,\" Thomas said. \"Fine,\" Victor said. \"Evey, you stay with me. If you two leave now, you should be there in an hour. If you two aren't back by sundown, we're leaving without you. Is that understood?\" \"Yes,\" Peter said. He and Thomas then began to make their way to the road. As they walked they lapsed into an uneasy silence. It was the first time they had been alone together since that night outside the Bismarck. After a half hour of silence Thomas spoke up. \"Tell me something, Peter. What made you decide that you didn't want to be an HJ anymore?\" Peter stopped and looked at him. \"I never wanted to be an HJ. I was forced into it remember? You were the one who joined up willingly.\" \"Right,\" Thomas said. \"What I meant was what made you decide that you couldn't knuckle under anymore?\" Peter paused for a moment before answering. He had avoided talking about it for years. He really didn't want to think about the horrors he had been directly a part of. Then again, Thomas had reported his own father to the Gestapo and he would probably never be seen again. Peter took a deep breath and began. \"The day before that night at the Bismarck, I was told by one of Herr Knopp's Lieutenants to deliver three packages. They were all the same shape and weight. I was given clear instructions not to look inside the packages. I delivered the first without incident, but at the second house the woman who answered the door asked me when her husband was coming home. I didn't have an answer so I gave her the package and left. As I was walking away, I heard a scream come from the house. It was a combination of agony and horror. \"After that I went to that park by the river. I sat on one of the benches with the third package for what seemed like hours. Finally I decided to defy orders and opened the package. It was a small wooden box. I opened it and inside…were ashes and a wedding ring. It was all that was left of someone's husband or wife. And I was the one who delivered them.\" Thomas looked apologetic. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.\" Less than ten minutes later, they walked into the town. For the next two hours, they walked through the streets looking for any sign a threat from the Gestapo, such as wanted posters. Upon finding none, they began to discuss ways of finding the information they were seeking, but Peter couldn't help but feel as though they were being watched. \"I think the first thing we should do is find a newspaper,\" Thomas said. \"That's probably the simplest way to find out what's been happening.\" \"Do you have any money?\" Peter asked. \"No, I don't. That would be a problem, wouldn't it?\" Peter nodded. \"I guess we'll have to ask somebody what's been going on.\" Thomas nodded his agreement and started looking around for someone to ask. Finally he stopped a young woman. \"Excuse me ma'am. My friend and I have been travelling through the country side for several weeks and haven't had a chance to hear any news. Could you please tell us what's been happening with the war?\" \"Certainly,\" she replied gleefully. \"I suppose you know that the Netherlands fell earlier this month?\" \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"I remember very little from that night.\" Thomas shot him a look and then turned back to the woman. \"We heard about that. We're really more interested in what's been happening in the last couple of days.\" \"Well, Belgium fell earlier this week. It's only a matter of time before France and Britain fall as well.\" Peter and Thomas exchanged glances. This was both good and bad news. It meant that once they got to France, they were free and clear—for now. They might be able to reach Paris before the Nazis. Hell, if Britain and France combined forces, they might be able to repel the Nazis completely. \"Is something wrong?\" the woman asked. \"No,\" Peter said. \"Things seem to be going well.\" \"Yes, thank you,\" Thomas said. \"We'll let you go about your business, then.\" The young woman nodded and walked away. Thomas then turned to Peter. \"Well we got what we wanted. Let's get the hell out of here.\" \"I agree. This place is making me nervous. I can't help but feel like we're being watched.\" \"I know the feeling,\" Thomas said taking a long look around the square. \"We should get back. It's going to be dark soon. We don't want to get left behind.\" Peter nodded in agreement. Then the two of them turned and headed for the road they had come in on. Less than an hour later, they were explaining what they had learned to Victor and Evey. \"It looks like Paris is our only option, then,\" Victor said, looking pointedly at Evey, who simply nodded in agreement. \"If I'm not mistaken,\" he continued, \"we are less than three days from the border. Once we are in France, it will take us another week or so to reach Paris, but the going will be much easier.\" \"When do we start out?\" Peter asked. \"Right now,\" Victor replied. \"We'll travel for another hour or two, and then rest. After that, it will be an almost non-stop push to the border. Once in France we will rest again. Are you ready?\" \"Not really,\" Thomas said. \"But I don't foresee being anymore ready any time in the immediate future, so let's go.\" Peter and Evey nodded their assent. \"Very well,\" Victor said. \"Let's go.\"[Chapter 10] Victor's plan of a non-stop push to the French border took more of a toll on the small group of fugitives than any of them had anticipated. On their third night, when Victor finally declared that they could rest for a night, it took every fiber of Peter's being not to hug him. One glance at Thomas and Evey told Peter that they were just as relieved as he was. They soon found a cave in which they could rest. It was damp and cold and uncomfortable in lots of other ways, but given how tired the three of them were, no one complained. Peter, Evey, and Thomas slept while Victor kept watch. The next morning, Peter was shaken awake by an enthusiastic Victor. \"What is it?\" Peter asked groggily. \"I was wrong,\" Victor said, beaming like a child on Christmas morning. \"What do you mean?\" Peter heard Thomas grumble from a few feet away. \"I was wrong about how long it would take us to get to France. We crossed the border yesterday. We've been in France for a day and a half.\" \"How do you know?\" Evey asked. She also sounded tired, but she now sounded interested. \"I went out to forage for food and I ran into a hunter. He was so surprised that he cried out—in French. I quickly explained that I was a traveler who had lost my way and asked how far the German border was. He told me that it was a day's walk from here.\" He paused as the others allowed the news to sink in. \"We've made it,\" he said looking from Peter to the others. \"We're free.\" The news had a mixed effect on Peter. Knowing that he had beaten the odds and escaped from the Nazis filled him with a renewed hope and lifted the ever present fear of being recaptured, but as he thought about what his making it to France truly meant, that he would likely have to live the rest of his life never knowing the fate of his family, an overwhelming sadness filled him. \"Are you okay?\" Victor asked Peter. Peter nodded and forced a smile. \"Just letting it sink in, I guess.\" Victor nodded and clapped Peter on the shoulder. \"So what now?\" Thomas asked. \"Now,\" Victor said as he stood, \"we make for Paris. The journey from here on in will be a little easier, but from what the man told me, the Nazis are likely to hit the Allied lines soon. I'd like to be in Paris before that if it is at all possible.\" \"Well, let's go,\" Evey said. \"I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm looking forward to sleeping in a bed again.\" With that, the four of them set out toward Paris. The journey passed very quickly from what Peter could remember. They stopped in many towns and met up with several people who were familiar with Victor and his work against the Nazis. These stops also allowed Peter, Thomas, and Evey to practice their French. Not all of the news they heard was good, however. A little over a week after they entered France, the news reached them that the Allied line had been broken. The British army had retreated back across the channel, and the French forces had surrendered. There was now nothing standing between Paris and the Nazi army. After this, Victor became very quiet and short-tempered. He pushed Peter, Evey, and Thomas a little harder each day, but they didn't complain, mostly because they wanted to reach Paris as quickly as Victor did, now that it was only a matter of time before it fell to the Nazis. It was another week before they reached Paris. That night was one that Peter would never forget. It started innocently enough, with the four of them through the woods. The closer they got to Paris, the longer Victor had pushed them each day, and the more he had encouraged travelling through the woods, both to save time and to limit the risk of being seen by anyone they would rather avoid. The sun had set two hours earlier, but they had a full moon to travel by. They were further motivated by the fact that they could see the lights of Paris just a few miles away. Suddenly they heard voices up ahead. They quietly began to sneak forward and soon came to the edge of a clearing. Sitting in the middle of the clearing was a small group of German soldiers, roughly four or five, sitting around a small campfire. \"These guys are part of the forward guard,\" Thomas whispered. \"The rest of the German army is probably a day out. They'll be in Paris by sun down tomorrow.\" Victor swore under his breath. \"To come this far, only to be blocked at the last steps,\" he said, his voice breaking slightly. \"Can't we sneak around them?\" Peter asked. \"Probably,\" Thomas said. \"We should head back a little ways and then try to sneak around. You know, give them a wide berth. And be careful where you step. We don't need them coming after us. And we'll have to be extra careful. There's likely more of these guys out here.\" The others nodded (at least Peter assumed that they did) and they started back. They hadn't gone five steps however before the snap of a twig echoed through the forest. Peter froze. For a minute, he hoped against hope that the Nazis hadn't heard them, but a series of murmuring voices behind him told him otherwise. In a panic, he looked to his right at Thomas who met his gaze with a look of equal panic. He turned to his left and met Victor's gaze as leaves began to rustle, telling him that the soldiers had entered the forest. He quickly sidestepped to hide behind a tree. He saw Victor, Evey, and Thomas do the same. He began to pray that the soldiers would turn back to their fire, but the shadow of a machine gun poking around the tree told him otherwise. He closed his eyes and said a quick prayer for his mother, Willi, Thomas, and Evey. A scuffle to his left stirred him from his thoughts. Turning he saw the outlines of Thomas and another soldier struggling in the moonlight. The machine gun next to his head disappeared, and Peter knew what he had to do. He jumped out from behind the tree and punched the soldier in the back of the head. \"Victor, Evey, run!\" he called as he hit the soldier again, knocking him to the ground. A flurry of rustling leaves told him they were moving. A half instant later a burst of machine gun fire erupted through the forest. After delivering a kick to the downed soldier's head, knocking him out, Peter ran toward the third soldier. He hit the soldier with such force that the two of them fell to the ground. Peter quickly recovered and wrestled the guard's machine gun from him, then proceeded to punch him in the side of the head. The guard slumped over, unconscious. Peter stood and turned around and found himself face-to-face with a fourth soldier. This one already had his machine gun pointed at him, and was too far away of Peter to make any sort of effort at defending himself. Not knowing what else to do, he raised his hands. Suddenly a shot rang out. The guard stumbled and fell over. Standing behind him was Thomas, holding a smoking pistol. \"You're welcome,\" the blonde said with a smirk as he walked over to Peter. \"Now let's get out of here before they—\"He was cut off as a burst of machine gun fire ripped into his body. He stumbled forward and fell into Peter's arms. Over his friend's shoulder, Peter saw that the man Thomas had shot hadn't been killed. As he raised his gun for another burst, Peter took the pistol from Thomas and, letting his friend fall, emptied the remainder of the bullets into the soldier's body. Sure that the soldier was dead now, Peter threw the gun aside and turned to his friend. \"Thomas,\" he whispered as he rolled him over. A cough told Peter that Thomas was still alive, but only just. \"Thomas, stay with me,\" he begged, though somewhere in his mind he knew it was futile. Thomas smiled. \"I was actually looking forward to Paris,\" he said, weakly. \"Don't talk like that,\" Peter begged his friend as he held him. \"It had to be this way, Peter,\" Thomas said. \"I've done too much wrong to make any of it right. I sold out my father. I tried to kill you. I did kill Arvid.\" \"No you didn't,\" Peter said, fighting back tears. \"Arvid committed suicide.\" \"But I drove him to it. And don't try to deny it either. We both know why he did it.\" Peter didn't say anything for a minute. Then he spoke up. \"You did make some of it right. You helped Evey and Victor escape. You saved my life just now. That's got to count for something, right?\" \"Maybe,\" Thomas said, though his voice was clearly distant. \"Maybe it was just enough.\" His eyes locked into Peter's and he grinned. Then he began to sing: \"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.\" Peter grinned a little too. \"Swing heil, Thomas,\" he said as his friend's eyes closed for the last time. Peter held Thomas' body for a minute longer before standing and hurrying after Victor and Evey.

That was not my life... My father has been cheating on my mom, ever since I came into the world. When my mother found out, there was a lot of screaming and tears. My mother packed up some of her clothes and stuff, and the same as me, and when I asked where we were going, she just said that me and her were going to live with grandma for awhile. After we moved in with my grandmother, who comforted us the best she could, I began to hate my father for the pain that caused me and mom. I would cry myself to sleep, thinking that it was my fault that my parents were over, my mother would try to convince me otherwise, but I wouldn't listen. One day, I walked into the small forest that was in my grandma's backyard, I was bored so I decided to explore. That was when I spotted a rabbit hole, and just as I was about to walk up to it. A figure climbed out of the hole, and I was shocked at who it was, it was the one and only Bugs Bunny. He was surprised to see a little girl like me in the forest, he bend down to my level and asked what was I doing there, and I told him while trying to not fan girl scream. We got to know each other, it went so well that I even told him about my father, and you want to know what he did. He comforted me with the fatherly affection that I have been wanting for a long time. He would tell me all his adventure he did with the other cartoons, but I really like the ones with Wile E. Coyote. Over the years, many things have happened. My parents divorced, and never spoke to each other again. Even though I haven't made any friends, I still got Bugs, who gives me presents on my birthday, and Christmas, and in return I make him some treats that taste like carrots, to his delight. I play basket ball in the backyard, and I read all the books in my grandma's library, which is a large as a normal library. My life was great Little did I know, that was about to change...[Chapter 3] Up in the night sky, past the moon, past a sign pointing to Moron Mountain, there was a scary-looking planet theme park called Moron Mountain. An alien boy and his dad are blasted from the ride, that they were on and crashed landed on the ground. They were a little bum down, but unhurt. Alien Kid: Let's get out of here Dad, this stinks. Don't bring me here anymore, right? Unknown to either of them, the alien boy and his dad were being watched on a surveillance cameras by Swackhammer, the owner of the theme park, who turns off the TV after listening to what he overheard. He was surround by his Nerdluck henchmen. Five of them were colored orange, red, blue, green, and purple. The short chubby, orange one is Pound, the tall 'special', blue one is Blanko, the tiny red one is Nawt, the green one is Bang, and the purple one is Bupkus. Swackhammer: Are you listening?! Did you hear him? Did you hear?! That little brat is right. I've told you once!, if I told you a thousand, thousand, THOUSAND, THOUSAND, THOUSAND TIMES! WE NEED NEW ATTRACTIONS! Nerdlucks: RIGHT! Swackhammer: New ones! Nawt: Ah-huh. Swackhammer: Get it? Nawt: (Filing Swackhammer's nails) Yeah, big shiny new things. Yeah. Bang: Absolutely sir. (Bupkus licking Swackhammer's sandals) Pound: Ah, don't listen to them, sir. Customers are just whiners. Swackhammer: Look at me! (flips on lighter) Look at me and listen! The customer is always right! As he spoke, he lit the lighter on Pound's butt, causing him to scream and run off the table. Nerdlucks: Right! Swackhammer: The customer is always right! (Smokes cigar) Always. Green drool fell from his mouth and splattered on Blanko's head, who gave a disgusted moan. Nerdlucks: RIGHT! Swackhammer: (Walked towards window) Ok, we need something. We need something...(Hand smacks Nerdlucks from behind) Nutty. Nawt: Nutty! Swackhammer: Something wacky. Nawt: Wacky! When Swackhammer sat down on his desk, he sat on his TV remote, turning on the little TVs. Swackhammer: We need something...something...something...something...we need something- Bukpus: Looney? Oops. Nawt: (Points to the TVs) Looney, thank you. Swackhammer: Looney? Swackhammer turned around to see Looney Tunes playing on his TVs. One with Tweety Bird giving Sylvester the cat an electrical shock, one with Daffy shouting at Elmer Fudd, another Wile E. Coyote blasting off on a rocket downhill, and another with Bugs Bunny massaging Elmer's head. Seeing the Looney Tunes gave Swackhammer an idea to save his theme park. Swackhammer: YES! LOONEY! YES! Now you're talking! Looney! Looney, that's it! That's the word I was looking for! Looney! Get the Looney Tunes! Bupkus: (Cheerleader jump) LOONEY TUNES! Swackhammer: Bring them here- Blanko: Excuse me, sir? Just noticing, sir. They're from Earth. What if they can't come? Swackhammer: What did you say? What if they can't come? He reached down and grabbed Blanko. An evil grin appeared on his face. Swackhammer: Make 'em. Blanko: (Mutters) Cool. Swackhammer: MAKE 'EM! Swackhammer and his Nerdluck henchmen cackled wickedly. Capturing the Looney Tunes and forcing them to work at his theme park would be perfect.[Chapter 4] Meanwhile back on Earth, Sophie is in Physical Education. It is Friday afternoon, last period of the day. Everyone is playing soccer outside on the field. Sophie is playing with a team wearing a yellow belt around her waist, while the other team are wearing green belts. The teams wore fake colored belts in order to tell which team is which. Throughout the game, Sophie's team behind the other team by a couple of points, that is because of the leader of the other team, John Matthews, a popular jock. Shawn: John is really good at soccer. Eric: Is there anything this guy can't do? On the field, Sophie was at the goalie, waiting for the ball to come, so she can kick it away from the net while a fellow team member, Kyle Logan, stood by, wanting to help cover her. Kyle: Got any plans for the weekend? Sophie: (Shrugs) I don't know. Maybe watch some Looney Tunes reruns. Kyle: (Rolls his eyes) You such a kid. Sophie: So what. Nothing wrong with that. The two got into position as the players were coming towards them, with the soccer ball. John kick the ball hard, but Sophie massaged to stop the ball, before it hit the net. The blue team cheered, when their teammate blocked the goal. While Katharine, a snobby teammate of Sophie's glared at her. Katharine: (Glares) Hey twit! Let the hunk score! Sophie: (Rolling her eyes) If he can get it past me, then sure. Moments later, the red belt team came back again and John kicked the ball into the net and his team cheered. Katharine: You suck! Sophie: Relax! I got the next one! Katharine: Well, here's you chance to prove it! The girls got back into position as the red belt team was coming back at them. John kicked the ball towards the net, but this time, Sophie was determined to prove herself. So, Sophie kicked the ball so hard and the ball hit John right in the groin. He grabbed his crotch as he screamed like a girl and fall to the ground, and curl up in a ball. His and Sophie's teams winced and said \"Ooooo\" When they saw where John got hit. Mrs. Baker, the gym teacher, checked on John to see if he was alright. Mrs. Baker: Are you alright? John: (Dazed and Squeaked) Yes... Mrs. Baker: Sophie, great kick. Just try to aim next time. The students from the blue belt team stared at Sophie in stunned silence as she walked past the staring vacant eyes to the locker room. Katharine was fuming while Sophie gave her a smirk like Wile E. Coyote's. Sophie: Still think I am useless? When school was over and the bell rang, teenagers raced out of the building for the bus, their parent's waiting cars, or their own cars. Sophie was just passing the staircase, when she saw Katharine and some other girls. Sophie was walking by, when she heard their conversation. Katharine: She is just a smug little girl, that deserves to get punched. Kate: I can't stand her! Kelly: I know! Sophie rolled her eyes at them and started to walk home. As she was walking, she was thinking on what desert she should make tonight. She makes desert for her family on Friday's, and she also set aside some for Bugs, since he likes her cooking. Sophie's thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of her cellphone. Fishing it out of her pocket, she saw her mom's name on the screen, and she answered it. Sophie: Hello. Rose: Hey sweetie. Guess what. Sophie: What? Rose: I got tickets to the Michael Jordan game. Sophie: (Excited) You did! Rose: Yep! So, hurry home, so we can go! Sophie ended the call and ran like the roadrunner straight home. At the baseball game, Michael Jordan didn't seem to be doing well with the sport. He was having trouble with his batting skills. However, everyone loved him so much, when her played with the Chicago Bulls, they never actually complained about his baseball skills. They would just applaud and cheer him one, when he swung the bat and missed the ball. Umpire: Strike one! Some people booed while most of them cheered. Sitting in the stands among the thousands of people were Sophie and her mom, Rose. As Michael stepped back up to the plate, the catcher thanked for autographing a basketball for his kid, and then told him not to swing at a curve ball. But, Michael was confused and ended up swing at the bat, getting himself a strike two. The crowd cheered for him anyways, except for Sophie. Rose: What's wrong, Honey? Sophie: He reminds me of myself. When I miss the ball during soccer. The only difference is people here are cheering and encouraging Jordan, but my teammates complain and don't encourage me to protect the goalie, and when I do, I don't get praised. Not to mention that I kicked the ball straight into the groin of the other team's leader. Rose laughed. Rose: Don't worry. People will one day. One of the baseball team's promoters was watching Michael carefully, so he call a fat guy named 'Stan' and told him to make sure nobody is to bother Jordan, just to make him the happiest player in the world. Meanwhile, Michael swung the bat again and he ended up getting a strike-out. The catcher didn't seem to mind as Michael walked back to the bench as everybody in the crowd applauded, even though he struck out. The other baseball players weren't worried as Michael sat down on the bench. Stan appeared from the top of the bleachers, trying to talk to Michael. He didn't realize that he was losing his grip from the top as he suddenly fell to the ground right in front of Michael. Sophie and Rose: (Winced) Oooooo! Rose turned to Sophie, while smiling nervously. Rose: Well, what can happen? All of a sudden, the wind picked harshly and a sonic boo was heard in the sky. Everyone looked up to see that it was blue and yellow striped spaceship with headlights, zoomed past the stadium and disappeared into the clouds. Sophie: (Still staring at the sky) What the heck was that? The spaceship dove underground in front of a Piggly Wiggly store while some people ran out of the way. Inside the spaceship were Pound, Bang, Bupkus, Nawt, and Blanko. Pound: Hang on! Bang: Hanging on! Nawt: Hanging on! Blanko: Are we there yet? There was something up ahead. The Nerdlucks screamed for a minute, but as they got closer, they could see a concentric Looney Tunes rings with the Warner Brothers logo at the center of it. The Looney Tunes theme song was heard as the Nerdlucks looked at the logo in awe. Pound: Bombastic! Nawt: Cool! Their spaceship squeezed through the Warner Brothers ring as if it were a portal to Looney Tune Land. The spaceship finally got through the portal. As the ship sailed through the sky, somewhere down in the forest below, Bugs Bunny was trying to get away from Elmer Fudd, who was shooting at him far behind a distance. Elmer: Alright, you rascal bunny! Come back here, you screwy rodent! After a few seconds of running, Bugs stops t talk to the audience. Bug: I'll be with you in a second folks, after I finish with nature boy here. Then, Elmer Fudd appeared as he poked his gun on Bug's head. Elmer: Alright, you pesky rabbit! I've got you now! Before Elmer could shoot, a ramp came down on his head, squishing him. Bugs looked up to see the Nerdlucks coming out of their spaceship. Pound: One small step for moi! Bang: One giant leap for Moron Mountain! No sooner he said that, he jabbed the end of the flagpole on Pound's foot, making him scream. Bugs just looked down on Elmer, still under the ramp. Bugs: And one whooper headache for Elmer Fudd. The Nerdlucks came down the ramp, close enough to Bug's feet, showing that they were very short. Bugs: Diminutive, ain't they? Bang: We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny. Nawt: Yeah, Bugs Bunny. Bang: Have you seen him? Pound: Where is the guy? Blanko: Is he around? Bugs looks at the audience with a face that basically said 'Really?' Bugs: Hmm. Bugs Bunny. Say, does he have great big long ears, like this? (Pulls his ears out) Nerdlucks: Yeah. Bugs: And does he hop around, like this? (Hops around the forest) Nerdlucks: Yeah! Bugs: Well does he say 'What's up Doc,' like this? (Eats a carrot with his hand on Pounds head) Eh, what's up, Doc? Nerdlucks: YEAH! Bugs: Nope. Never heard of him. He walked away, leaving the Nerdlucks with disappointed groans. Bugs:(Looks at the Audience) You know, maybe there is no intelligent life out there in the universe after all. As he walked on through the forest, humming to himself, a fire blast shot at him from nowhere. The blast destroyed part of the forest and gave Bugs quite a shock as he was covered in soot. Pound: Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune! Bugs turned around in shock as his ears dropped to see that the Nerdlucks shot him with their alien guns that remind him of bazookas. Bupkus: hey, what do you think we are, stupid? Nawt: Don't move a muscle! Pound: Ok Bunny. Gather up your Tune pals. We're taking you for a ride! Blanko: Totally, alright! So, like, where are we going? Annoyed with Blanko's stupidity, Pound smacked Blanko in the face, leaving him dizzy. Blanko: Are we there yet?[Chapter 5] Sophie was in the living with her mom watching the news. Michael Jordan was striking out and the news man was talking trash about it. Sophie: (To the Reporter) Mom get me the bat, so I can knock his lights out! Reporter: Michael, I know golf is your sport, but not here. Sophie: He's keeping a promise! Rose: (Shakes her head and gets up) I don't want to listen to this. Go ahead and watch what you want. She left the room, leaving Sophie in the living room. Sophie picked up the remote and flipped through some channels until she stopped at a good Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner cartoon. (Beep, Beep). Wile E. Coyote was carrying a heavy anvil and started walking across the wire, but the wire dipped down low towards the ground. Sophie: (Laughs and Smiles Fondly) Wile E. Coyote, you are a funny guy. Sophie has been harboring a crush on the coyote, ever since she was little. He would always make her laugh. Even though, he is her favorite. She loves the Looney Tunes with all her heart. Sophie watched the coyote on the screen with a pang of sympathy, for she understands the rough treatment that he was getting from the Roadrunner, almost like the rough treatment that she gets at school. On TV, Wile touched the ground when the Roadrunner showed up. He mad a meep, meep sound and raced away. Then Porky Pig ran up to the screen. Porky: Stop this c-c-cartoon! (Roadrunner returns) We've got an em-m-m-mergency Cartoon Union M-M-Meeting to go to! Seeing Porky in this cartoon was quite a surprise for Sophie. Then, the Roadrunner quickly sped off with Porky behind him. Porky: Hey! Wait for-wait for m-hold your horses! Wile dropped the anvil and started to follow them, only for the wire that he was standing on, shot him up in the air and off screen. Right after the gag, there were no characters on the screen, only the scenery. Sophie stared at the television in confusion. Sophie: (Confused and Worried) What's going on? That night in Looney Tune Land, toons from many cartoons were going into Town Hall for the meeting. Wile came crashing through the roof and landed on the carpet floor, and was covered in soot. Daffy Duck came in, wrapped in bath towels and soaking wet, and stepped on Wile's snout and pushed Foghorn Leghorn aside on his way in. Daffy: Stop the Music! Top duck coming through! Jeez! So, what's the big emergency? Everyone turned to the figures on stage. The Nerdlucks stood there as they had Bugs Bunny tied up in chains after they had captured him, but Bugs decided to play it cool, like he usually does. Bugs: These little guys here would like to make a announcement. (Holds a microphone for Pound) Here ya go, shorty. The Nerdlucks pushed Pound forward, so he could make the announcement. Pound: Alright, alright! (Clears throat) You. All of you, are now our prisoners! A moment of silence occurred throughout the entire theater, then laughter erupted from the world crowd of toons. Sylvester: (Sarcastically) We're in big trouble now! Pound was embarrassed, but Nawt tried to help by turning the microphone in his direction. Nawt: We're taking you to our theme park in outer space! Blanko: No fooling. Nawt: Where you'll be our slaves! Placed on display for the amusement of our paying customers! Sylvester chuckled as he looked over at Elmer Fudd. One of the hillbilly brothers looked at Porky as if these aliens were being serious with their threat. Porky just smirked and shrugged at them. Daffy: (Sarcastically) Oh, fear clutches to my breast! The toons started laughing again while Daffy and Sylvester were heading for the exit. Yosemite Sam came up on stage with his guns blasting. Yosemite Sam: Now hold it right there, varmint! We ain't a goin' nowhere! He aimed his two pistols at Pound, but the alien grabbed his laser gun and shot Sam, leaving him in his underwear and burning him to a crisp. Then, the other aliens held out their laser guns at the audience, who had stopped laughing when they saw what they did to Yosemite Sam. Pound: (Threateningly) You were saying? Alright, everybody aboard the spaceship! The toons immediately raised their hands in the air to surrender as if they are gonna be arrested. But Bugs was coming with a plan as he removed the chains from his body. Bugs: Eh, not so fast Doc. You can't just turn us into slaves. That would be bad. You got to give us a chance to defend ourselves. Pound: (Mock tone) Oh yeah? Who says? He aimed his laser gun at Bugs as the rabbit showed them a book that said 'How to draw Cartoon Characters' but Bugs changed the title, so that it said 'How to capture Cartoon Characters.' Bugs: There! Read 'em and weep, boys! The five aliens looked through the book and found a piece of paper taped to a page that said 'Give them a chance to defend themselves' Bang: Do we have to? Nawt: It's in the rule book. Blanko: Ok! It is in the rule book! Pound: Ok, we'll give you a chance to defend yourselves. In order to fight for your freedom, you gotta give us a challenge. Bugs: Uno momento! (Goes through door) We have to confer! (Closes door) Backstage at the theater backroom, Bugs was dressed as a general while standing behind a huge American flag. With him backstage were Daffy, Porky, and Elmer Fudd. Bugs: Alright troops! It is for us to choose a battlefield that affords- Porky: Oh! I g-g-got it! Bugs: Yes, Private Porkster. (Helmet covers his eyes) Porky: How about we challenge them to a b-b-b-spelling bee. Elmer: Say, we could have a bowling tournament. (Laughs) Sylvester: (Walks in) Suffering Succotash! What's wrong with all of ya? I'd say we get a ladder, wait til the old lady's out of the room, than grab that little bird! The putty tat was in the middle of having an imagination, that involved him finally capturing Tweety Bird and he was breathing heavily with red eyes and in a maniac manner, until Bugs patted him on the back and calmed him down. Bugs: Whoa, whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly. (Sylvester nods rapidly) Ok, let's analyze the completion. He pulled down a chart that was a blue print showing the Nerdlucks' height and weight and what they looked like. Bugs: Now. What are we looking at here? We've got a small race of invading aliens. Daffy: Small arms, short legs. (Shorted his arms and legs) Elmer: Not very fast. (Rubs his chin) Sylvester: Tiny little guys. Porky: Can't jump high. Suddenly, an idea for a challenge came in their brains as they all smiled evilly. The Nerdlucks entered the room, when the chart rolled up, and Bugs held up a basketball and spun it on his finger as he, Daffy, Sylvester, Porky, and Elmer looked down on the little aliens, arms folded. Bugs: We challenge you to a basketball game! Pound: Alright! Basketball it is! Bang: Basketball! Nawt: Yes! Bupkus: Boy, oh boy! Blanko: Alrighty! Uh...what is basketball? Bupkus: What's that? Nawt: Beats me. Bang: We didn't have it in school. Pound: I have no idea. Bugs: LIGHTS! The big screen in the theater came to life as the movie went started to countdown to start the film. Foghorn was trying to find a seat, which was hard for some toons to see. Barnyard Dawg: Hey! Down in front! He tossed his bag of popcorn at Foghorn's head, knocking him out, so the audience could see. That's when an old black and white, retro tutorial movie about basketball started. Narrator: An exhilarating team sport currently growing rapidly in the popularity is basketball. Unlike football and baseball, only five men can play on the team. It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle game that requires wits and even faster reflexes. Here's how it's done in the professional ranks. The National Basketball Association, featuring the best players in the world. When the narrator of the film mentioned 'the best players in the world,' this gave the Nerdlucks an idea, smiling malevolently. Nawt: The best players in the world. Bupkus: The best![Chapter 6] That night in New York City at an NBA game, the Nerdlucks snuck into the game wearing a trench-coat and hat. They stole the talents from the five NBA stars, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley, leaving the players tripping over themselves like fifth-graders at their first square dance. At home, Sophie was watching TV in her room. The news about the NBA incident was on the TV. It was showing clips of the NBA players getting hit in the face with the ball, dropping the ball, and walking awkwardly, not to mention acting strange. Sophie: (Bewildered) Seriously, what the heck is going?! First a spaceship at a football game, then happened on my favorite show, and now this. Sophie sighed and laid her head down on her pillow. Sophie: Maybe I should ask Bugs, if he knows something. She turns her head towards her window on the left side of her room, looks at the forest in her backyard. Sophie: What is he doing anyway? In Looney Tune Land, Bugs was showing Sylvester, Elmer, Foghorn, Wile, Sam, Porky, Pepe, Tweety, and Taz how to play basketball. Bugs: Ok, ok. Now. Which of you maroons has ever played basketball before? No one answered. Obviously, no toon has ever played basketball before. The Daffy popped up. Daffy: I have coach! And there's an important question I need to ask you. A stage appeared and on the walls were shadows of ducks wearing women's clothes. Daffy was dressing up in different styles of clothes while 'Giving You All That I Got' plays in the background. Daffy: What do you think? I'm kind of partial to purple and gold myself. It goes better with my coloring. Porky: (Comes over) Guys! Uh, n-nice outfit Daffy. T-The little aliens say it's their turn to use the court. The Nerdlucks were working out, but not too well. Bugs: Eh sure. Let the little pipsqueaks knock themselves out. Daffy: Too bad. You can't practice getting taller boys! The other toons laughed and walked off. But as the toons started to leave, the sky got dark and thunder crashed. The Nerdlucks opened a bag and touched a glowing ball that held the NBA player's talents. They touched the ball and started to feel funny. The toons turned around to see what happened. Suddenly, the Nerdlucks began to transform and grew bigger, taller, muscular, and scarier. The toons looked up at them terrified as the monsters towered over them, grinning malevolently, like a group of bullies. Blanko: Hey little pig. Boo Porky: Aaaah! (Looks down) I wet myself. Bang: (Picks up the basketball) Time to play a little basketball. He threw the ball to the ground, causing an earthquake and surrounding Daffy, Porky, Sylvester, Elmer, Wile, Taz, Sam, and Foghorn. Daffy: Those little pipsqueaks just turned into superstars! Porky: They're m-m-m-monsters! Sylvester: Suffering succotash! They're Monstars! The Monstars stomped away, while Bang popped the ball between his fingers with a pop. Bang: Bye, bye. As the Monstars left, a building collapsed. Bugs was munching on a carrot and watched them leave, then turned to the audience. Bugs: Eh, I think we might need a little bit of help. A short time later, Sophie was at the park, practicing for the next gym class activity next week, which is basketball. She was shooting, dribbling, and etc. as she was pretending that she was facing opponents. She was so focused in what she was doing, that she did not see a pair of binoculars watching her from a rabbit hole. As she was practicing, a voice called out to her. ?: (Snobbish tone) Hey Sophie. Sophie turned around and scowled at the owner of the voice, Katharine. Sophie: (Turns back to shooting hoops) What do you want now, Katharine? Katharine: What are you doing? Sophie: Practicing for next week's activity. Katharine scoffs at Sophie, making said person, stop and fully turn towards her. Sophie: (Glares) What now? Katharine: That is what don't get about you. You're a girl and yet you enjoy doing boyish things. What you spend to much time with you dear old dad. Sophie drops the basketball and glares harshly at Katharine. Sophie: Carefully where you are trending, Katharine. Katharine just gives her a cruel and evil smile. Katharine: At least...I still have my father. Sophie's glare intensified. Katharine: What ever did happen to you dad? Did he abandon you, Oh that is probably it. I mean, who wouldn't want a useless weakling like you, and who knows maybe you're mother will abandon you soon. (Laughs cruelly) Sophie was trying to hold in her anger as Katharine was running her mouth at her, but when she talked about her mother abandoning her, that was when she snapped. She shoved Katharine Sophie: (Sneers and Speaks Harshly) You think you are all tough, because you are daddy's little girl. Well, you need to face things on your own, because daddy dearest won't be there to protect you from all you battles. (Lowers her head as her shoulders began to shake.) Sophie lifted her head up, making Katharine see the tears running down Sophie's face. Sophie: My father was sleeping with another w-woman, ever since I-I was b-born, so I don't know what it is like to have a f-father, nor do I want that awful man in my life, ever ag-gain. As she spoke, Sophie's voice was starting to crack. Katharine just stared at Sophie, before a cruel smirk formed on her face. Katharine: Then, maybe you should not have been born then. Sophie's tears came down faster. She had enough of people like Katharine, making fun of her, for her father, she wanted it to end. Sophie began to break down, she then turned around ran towards the hilltop that were near the park... in the direction of the rabbit hole.[Chapter 7] Sophie ran as fast she can to get far away from Katharine. As she reached the rabbit hole, her legs gave out and she fell on stomach. She then laid there for a moment, before she began to sob. Sophie just wanted to forget about the whole ordeal, all the bullying that she suffered over the years, hoping that everything would be Ok, but Katharine's words were still in her head, and that made her sob harder. Sophie: (Sobbing) W-Why? What h-have I-I done t-to deserve this c-cruel fate?! Sophie laid there for a couple more moments, before she sat up on her knees, reached up, wiped her tears away, and lowered her hands back on her lap. She then looked up at the sky for a moment before closing her eyes, Sophie: I just wish people would like to be my friend, and for people to appreciate me for all my hard work. There is an old saying 'Be careful, what you wish for,' because no sooner did Sophie said those words, a rope popped up from the rabbit hole and lassoed her arms. Sophie's eyes snapped open and gasped as she found herself yanked through the hole. In the tunnel of the rabbit hole, Sophie was pulled deeper into the underground while she was screaming. Up ahead, she saw the Warner Brothers portal. She closed her eyes as she was squeezing right through it, and because of her closed eyes. She did not see the sparkles that shimmered around her, transforming her. Sophie fell through the sky and landed in Looney Tune Land with a big thud that shook the ground, briefly. Yosemite Sam was the reason, that Sophie was dragged down into Looney Tune Land as he reeled back the rope, he used to pull the young lady into the cartoon world. Sophie stood up, shaken and dizzy from the fall. She was seeing birds for a minute for a minute, when she saw Bugs standing under the tree, greeting them. Bugs: Uh, look out for that first step, kid. It's a real lulu. Sophie: (Confused) Bugs? Bugs: Eh, you were expecting maybe the Easter Bunny? Also welcome to Looney Tune Land, kiddo. Sophie looked around and she was in awe. Everything around her was cartoonish. She began to smile and laugh in joy, the sound of her laugh made a soft smile appeared on Bugs' face, she was so very broken earlier, but now her inner child is released. He decided to point out one more thing to her. Bugs: Also, look at yourself. Sophie was confused, but when she looked down at herself and gasped. She was still wearing her clothes, but she saw fur on her arms. She looked down at her reflection in puddle of water. She saw a grey wolf with green eyes and brown hair staring back at her. Sophie: (Shocked and in awe) I'm a cartoon. At that moment, Elmer Fudd looked out of a barber shop with Foghorn. Elmer: Oh, look! Is that her? Sylvester: (From a manhole) Oh boy! Granny: Isn't she beautiful? Taz: (Comes out of a mailbox) Basketball! High up in a tree in his nest, Tweety looked down and saw the newcomer. Tweety: I tawt I taw...I did; I did see a wulf. The Looney Tunes surrounded Sophie with looks of interest. Porky: P-P-Pardon me, but we're s-s-so happy to have you here at such d-d-difficult times. Foghorn: Young lady, I say, young lady. Welcome to Looney Tune Land! Sophie: (Smiles kindly) Thank you. Granny: So, this is the young lady that you have been telling everyone about, Bugs? Bugs: (Munching on a carrot) Eh, that's right. Meet Sophie. Pepe: Bonjour Mademoiselle. Sylvester: (Pushes Pepe away) Beat it, stinky! (To Sophie) Excuse me, mam. New to these parts? Before Sophie could say anything, Sylvester was shoved to the side, and when Sophie saw who it was, she blushed. Standing in front of her was none other then her little crush, Wile E. Coyote. He held his hand out for her to shake. A shock went through their bodies as Sophie shook it shyly, with her head down, but glanced up at him with a blush still on her face. But then, the moment was broken. When Roadrunner speared, pushing Wile aside, checking out Sophie, and then he made a meep meep in her face. Sophie: (Giggles) Hello to you too. Taz and Speedy looked over the wolf girl. Speedy took off his hat, and bowed to her like a gentleman while Taz gave her some flowers. But then, Daffy arrived, shoving the toons aside, and was wearing a doctor outfit to check up on wolf girl. Daffy: Back up! Let the doctor take a look. He pulled a lever, and Sophie was shot right in the sky in a chair and stopped in midair. Daffy: Oops. A little high. Sophie: (Gulps) Oh boy Daffy: Going down! He pulled down the lever and Sophie fell down screaming and land back on the ground. The toons held up score cards at her landing. Daffy: So, what do you say, we go for a little spin? He spun the chair around, making the wolf feel dizzy. Daffy looked through Sophie's ear to see if they were clear. Daffy: Now let's see what we got inside here. Bugs: (From the other side of Sophie's ear) Yodelayheehoo! Then Daffy placed a thermometers in Sophie's mouth. Daffy: Say ah! The thermometer exploded and he stamped her forehead that says 'A-OK.' Daffy: Alright! She's okay! Sophie giggled as she rubbed the stamp on her forehead. After she was done, She turned to Bugs, who was standing right next to her. Sophie: So Bugs, I been meaning to ask you. Why didn't you show up yesterday, and why did you bring me here? Bugs: Why, I thought you'd never ask. You see these aliens came from outer space and want to make us slaves for their theme park. Eh, what do we care; they're little. So we challenged them to a basketball game. But then they show up and they ain't so little; THEY'RE HUGE! We need to beat these guys, because they're talking about slavery. They'll make us do stand-up comedy, the same jokes every night for all eternity. We're gonna be locked up like wild animals and be trotted out to perform in front of a bunch of low-brow, bug-eyed, fat-headed, humor challenged aliens! Eh, what I'm trying to say is: WE NEED YOUR HEEEELP! Sophie: (Distressed) Whoa! What?! I'm not that good, Bugs?! Bugs: I've been watching you. I watched you play in the park, and at home. Sophie: (Shakes her head) Bugs. I don't think I'm any good. Bugs: Right, and I've quit being a Shakespearean actor. (Holds up a rabbit skull) Sophie: (Conflicted) Bugs. I-I...I don't know. Bugs wraps a arm around Sophie's shoulders. Bugs: (Speaks softly) Do you really want us to be gone forever? Your childhood heroes? Me? Even You-Know-Who? For a minute, Sophie was pondering about her answer.[Chapter 8] The toons led Sophie into the gymnasium. Sophie: Bugs. I am still not sure. Bugs: Eh, you will change your mind after seeing our facilities! The wolf girl stared at the gym in shock and disgust. It was a like a hurricane came through. Daffy: (Holds a hoop) We got hoops! (Hoop breaks and he falls) Elmer: We got weights! Taz lifted a weight, but a piece fell on the Goofy Gophers and it toppled, carrying Taz with it. Sylvester: We've got balls! He showed Sophie, a locker and opened it, but a variety of balls buried him. Sophie giggled. Sophie: (Looks around the room) Uh, guys. What about the mess on the floor. Daffy: Mess? You're about a little mess? There's nothing a little spit shine wouldn't fix. Spit Shine! Sylvester: Spit Shine! The toons starting spitting on the floor. Taz grabbed two mops and did his signature spin. As he spun around, he cleaned the whole gym, making it look brand new. Taz: Lemony fresh! Sophie: (Laughs) You guys are nuts. Porky: Correction, we're the Looney Tunes. Daffy: And as exclusively property and trademark of Warner Brothers Inc. He held up his butt to show a WB logo, kissing the logo with a big smooch. Suddenly, they heard a rumbling noise. Nawt burst through the door with a snarl, followed by Pound with a roar. Bang and Bupkus broke through the double door. Bupkus: I'm here! Blanko: (Enters) Me too! (Hits a basketball hoop and covers his face) That hurt! The Monstars approached the wolf girl, growling with interest. Sophie: (Glares at the Monstars) Who are these guys? Bugs: (Hides behind Sophie) Well, remember the tiny aliens I told you about? He pointed at the Monstars, indicating that those were the tiny aliens. Sophie gulped. Sophie: (Worried) Oh dear. Pound: You've heard of the Dream Team, well we're the Mean Team, doll. Bupkus: Doll! Sophie: (Eye twitches) Doll? Nawt: We're the Monstars: M-O-N...um? Pound: I haven't seen you around, Doll. Where are you from? Sophie hated being called Doll, and she is pretty sure, every female does. Sophie: (Glares) I'm new around here. Pound: Heard you are professional in basketball. Let's see what you got, girl! He tossed the ball at Sophie, but Sophie did not want to play with these guys. Sophie: I don't play with bullies. (She tosses the ball back to Pound.) Bukpus: \"I don't play with bullies\" The Monstars laughed at that comment. Bang: Maybe you're chicken. He started flapping his arms and clucking. Foghorn tried to defend the wolf girl. Foghorn: I say, I resemble that remark! Sophie: You are nothing, but children! Pound: Hey! Pound grabbed Sophie and made her into the shape of a basketball. Pound tossed her to Nawt and dribbled her. He tossed Sophie away to Bang, who caught her, and dunked her so hard that the glass from the basketball hoop broke. Sophie bounced and moaned until she came back to her normal shape. The Toons looked at her with worried faces as Sophie returned to her normal shape. Pound: Hey everybody! Look at your hero now! Sophie felt someone help stand up. She opened her eyes as she looked to the source only to see Wile. It turns out that Wile was the one, who helped her. Sophie couldn't help, but give Wile a small smile. Sophie: (Smiling Kindly) Thanks, Wile. He gives her a kind look back, that made her cheeks heat up. Foghorn: You ok, miss? Sophie: I think so. (Glares at the Monstars) You guys are making a big mistake. Bang: You're all washed up, mutt! Both Sophie and Wile growled at the insult. Sophie: Mutt?! Tweety: She is not washed up! Sophie's the greatest ever! Bang: Shut up. He flicked Tweety against the wall and slid to the ground. Sophie gasped and rushed over to him with Wile, right behind her. She gently picked Tweety up in her paws as him moaned in pain. Sophie and Wile were staring at him with concern. Sophie: (Concerned) Tweety? Tweety: My poor little cranium. Blanko: Yeah, are you ok? (Bang and Bupkus growled at him) Whoops. Tweety: You're not scared of them, are you Sophie? Sophie glanced at the Monstars, who each gave her a evil grin. Furious and angered by the treatment that they gave Tweety, Sophie gently handed Tweety over to Wile. She then, whirled around to face the savages. Sophie: (Growling) You are making a huge mistake. Bang: Oooh. Like we're really scared of you. What are you gonna do about it, mutt? The Monstars only laughed and jeered at her. Pound: Sorry, basketball ain't right for you, Doll. (He shoves a finger in her face.) Sophie tried her hardest to ignore their childish insults. But when they called her Doll again, that was when she snapped. Her whole body slowly turned red, ready to explode like the thermometer Daffy gave her earlier. Growling, Sophie grabbed Pound's finger, and lifted him in the air, causing the Monstars to stop laughing, and watch as well as the Toons. Sophie then started slamming Pound on the ground over and over while he was screaming his head off. The Toons were staring at Sophie in amazement as She then shaped Pound into a ball like he did to her, and then tossed him into the air. Sophie then pulls a bat from behind her, readies herself, while having a evil wolfish smirk on her face. As Pound came back down, she swung the back and knocked him straight into the other Monstars, making them shoot out of the gym while screaming their heads off. The Toons looked at Sophie in awe. They had never seen anyone stick up for them before, nor show that kind of nerve to stand up to those creeps. Sophie: If those creeps, think for one minute that they are gonna take my childhood from me. They can think again. Sophie then walked over to the basketball on the floor, picked it up, and faced the Looney Tunes. She then looked at each toon as they were giving her a hopeful look on each of their faces, she then stopped at Bugs, who was smirking at her, and then her eyes landed on Wile, who had a fond look on his face. Sophie really was in love with the coyote after all. She gave him a breath taking smile and it resulted in Wile having a dreamy look on his face as hearts were in his eyes. Sophie giggled at how silly, he looked, she then face her heores. Sophie: (Smile) Let's play some basketball.[Chapter 9] The Toons were in the gym practicing for the game. But, they were doing what they would do normally do in their cartoons. Yosemite Sam fired his guns, Foghorn was whacking Barnyard Dog's butt, Pepe pranced after Penelope, and Taz was spinning as usual. Daffy lost a bunch of feathers on his butt. Wile E. Coyote got his hands on a basketball after it bounced off of Daffy's head, but Roadrunner stole it from him and meep, meeped at him. Roadrunner raced around the room, spun around Sophie, and raced off into a painted image of the desert. An angry Wile tried to go after him, but he smacked face into the painted image and it rolled up, wrapping up Wile in the process. Sophie ran over, pulled Wile out and brushed him off. Sophie: (Worried) Are you alright? Wile: Don't worry, my dear. I am used to it. Sophie gasped. Sophie: (Surprised) You talked. Wile: True, but i only speak, when i am working with Bugs Bunny. (Twiddles thumbs, nervously) Does it bother you? Sophie: (Giggled) No. I always found it quite charming. Wile: (Laughs) Well, i must also say that your voice sounds like the voice of a angel. The two canines just stood there gazing into each other's eyes, with nothing, but fondness in their eyes. The moment was broken, when someone cleared their throat. The canines looked over to see, Bugs with a smirk on his face. Sophie and Wile smiled at each other, before the female canine walked over to Bugs. Bugs: (Smirking) Eh, What were you doing, toots? Sophie rolled her eyes, playfully at him. Then, she addressed the Toons. Sophie: Ok! Isn't there anyone here, who knows hot to play basketball? The doors to the gym opened and a pretty, slim, peach and cream colored, blond haired, female bunny entered the gym. ?: Um, i have! Sophie: Where did you come form? ?: I heard that you're practicing for a big game. I'd like to try out for the team. Bugs: (Love-struck) She is the rabbit of my dreams! Muscles of steel...fur as soft as silk...brave as a lion! I love her! I...(Chokes)...love her! The female bunny smiled and held her hand for a handshake, introducing herself to bugs. Lola: Hi. My name is Lola Bunny. Bugs: (Shakes her hand, eagerly) Lola! Lola: (Giggles) Yes? Bugs: Hello, name is...(Belches) BUGS! Lola chuckled while Bugs, embarrassed, cleared his throat. Bugs: You wanna play a little one on one, Doll? Hearing that word, Sophie pretty much grabbed everyone, but Bugs and Lola. Once she placed everyone on the other side of the room, they looked over to her in confusion, to which she kindly explained. Sophie: You know how mad i was, when the Monstars called me, Doll? (The Toons nod their heads) That is what Bugs, pretty much did to Lola. They looked over and saw Lola's eyes burned with anger while Bugs, not knowing this, had hearts in his eyes. Lola: DOLL?! Bugs: Uh-huh! Lola: On the court...BUGS. Bugs: Sure! He rushed over to join her on their little one on one game. Tweety: Ooh. She's hot. Everyone watched as Lola dribbled the ball with ease while Bugs got Into position. Lola: Ready? Bugs: Yes. He tried to catch the ball as she ran around him in circles. Bugs: I got it! I got it! But, he got all tied up as Lola dribbled the ball and jumped up in the air and dunked the ball into the basket. Sophie: (Amazed) Wow! As Lola seductively approached bugs, he glanced up at her. Bugs: Yes? She brought his head close to her face. Lola: Don't ever call me...Doll. Bugs: Check! (Drops to the floor.) She smiled as she walked towards the exit while the others were mesmerized by her. Lola: Hey, nice playing with you. Sophie: Hey, Lola! Feel free to join the team. Lola looked back at Sophie and smiled while giving her a slight nod, before she exited the gym. Sophie: (Smirks) Smooth, Bugs. Bugs: Eh, she's obviously nuts about me. Sophie rolled her eyes at him. Sophie: Where's the ball? (Pepe gives him the ball) You guys are getting a little out of control with basketball. Let me show you, how it is done. But, she fell to the floor, when the sleeve of her pants was caught on the floor. Sophie: Can anyone lend me a pair of sneakers? Bugs: Uhhh, sneakers? The rabbit looked down at his feet. Neither he or any of the Toons were wearing sneakers. Tweety: Sorry! Sophie: Well. Somebody is gonna have to got to my house, and get my basketball stuff. Daffy: Your house? In 3D land? Sophie: Yes. And while you're there, keep out of my mom and grandma's sight. I don't wanna think how they'll react if they find you and Bugs in my house. Daffy: Bugs is coming too? Sophie: Yeah, someone's gotta keep an eye on you, Daffy. Plus, Bugs has already been to my house before. Bugs: Eh, we'll be alright. After Bugs and Daffy left, Sophie just remembered something. Sophie: (Worried) Oh no. Wile, who was next to her, looked at her. Wile: What is it, my dear? Sophie looked at him while smiling sheepishly. Sophie: I forgot to tell them about...my dog. That night in the real world, Bugs and Daffy were tunneling underground to get to Sophie's house. Daffy: The view back here stinks! He stopped suddenly, when he bumped into Bugs. Daffy: Now, what? Bugs: We're right in front of the Smith house. Daffy: I know that. Bugs: Shh! Ok, let's go this way. Daffy: I say, let's go this way. Bugs: He just never learns. Sighing, Bugs tunneled to the house doorstep while Daffy tunneled to the backyard. Daffy: Now. let's see, I must be very close. He flickered on a lighter to see where he was, only to find himself, face to face with a German Shepherd, who growled at Daffy. Daffy: (Faces the audience with a panicked face) Mother. While the dog was attacking Daffy, inside the doghouse. Bugs managed to get himself into the Smith house with no problem. Bugs: Still a nice digs. (A knock at the door) Well, well. I wonder who that could be. He opened the door and Daffy fell in, all beat up from the dog. Daffy: (Dazed) Twinkle, twinkle, little star. (He falls to the floor.) Bugs: Shh! Everyone's sleeping! Daffy: (Gets up) I knot that! Bugs: C'mon. We got to get the gear. They began searching the house, peeking in from door to door to different parts of the house. Bugs: Nope! Nothing here. Daffy: Nope! Ah, what a very nice dining set. Bugs: Nuh-uh! Not here. Let's look upstairs. Daffy: (Sarcastic) yes, oh fearless leader. Luckily, the first room that they came to was Sophie's room. They noticed it was covered in Looney Tunes merchandise. Posters of each character were up on the walls, small statues of them were on the shelves by the window, and there were plushies of the cartoons on a small chest in front of the bed. However, the Wile E. Coyote plushie was on the bed. Bugs smirked at the thought of Sophie cuddling up to Wile, every night. Daffy opened the closet and the gear was right there in a bag. Daffy: I got the stuff. Then, they heard a loud thud from behind the door, and they both froze in thier tracks. Bugs/Daffy: We're caught! But, no one came inside the room. It was suddenly quiet. Bugs: Who's out there? Daffy: Ok, ok. I'll check. He opened the door and was face to face with the german shepherd, who growled at Daffy, who slammed the door in the dog's face. Daffy: I found an angry German Shepherd. The dog rammed the door down, crushing Daffy painfully. Daffy: The pain! Bugs ran towards them. He manages to jump over the dog and grab Daffy in the process. They ran outside and into the forest in the backyard. The dog was barking at the forest, and Rose came out after from being woken up by the dog's barking. Rose: (Kneels and strokes the dogs) Charlie, what's wrong? Charlie whimpered as he stared at the forest. Rose: (Stands up) Come on, you can sleep with Momma. Charlie then runs back into the house, while Rose just stands there looking at the forest, hoping that her daughter was alright. Rose: (Softly) Sophie...[Chapter 10] At the gym, Daffy, Porky, Taz, Foghorn, Sylvester, Tweety, Wile, and Lola were using a TV and moving along to an exercise instructor on screen. Bugs stuck his head out from the door to the locker room. Bugs: Eh, guys? Looney Tunes: Yes? Bugs: Look who's finally ready to play. As he stepped back and opened the door, Sophie walked out. Her basketball uniform was all blue with black lining. The Toons stared at her with looks of awe. Sophie: You better pay attention to see how it is done. She began showing the Toons some moves and ducked the ball in the hoop without missing. The Toons were clapping and cheering for her. Sophie: Got it? (The Toons nod) Good! Now. Show me what you got. Through the day to afternoon, and after the next day's practice. Sophie decided to explore the rest of Looney Tune Land for fun, or hang out with her toons. Wile was trying to build super rocket blades to help him in the big game, tomorrow. But, the pieces didn't fit well and they fell apart. Sophie saw this and attempted to help him. At first, Wile thought that Sophie couldn't do it, but that changed when he saw Sophie managed to put it together. When Wile attempted to try out the rocket blades, they went too fast and then Wile crashed into a wall. Concerned, Sophie ran over to him, and kneeled down on the ground while taking his head in her arms. The coyote slowly opened his eyes and gazed up into the wolf girl's beautiful and sparkling eyes. The way that she is looking at him and holding him, it sent a spark through the coyote's body. Wile gave her a small smile to let her know, that he is fine. She smiled back at him, and ran her hand through the fur on his head, as he closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation. That night, the Looney Tunes were at Bugs' mansion. Sophie was telling them about her life. They never knew that they kept their number one favorite fan going after her whole ordeal. When she told them about the incident with the soccer ball, they all laughed so hard that they were not making any noise. But that changed, when Sophie told them about the thing with Katharine, they were really angry that Wile, picked up Roadrunner and tossed him out the window without realizing that he had his nemesis in his hands, Sophie was touched that the Toons are so protective of her. That night, the Looney Tunes left for their homes for the night. Sophie was sitting in the grass in front of the mansion as she was looking up and watching the stars. She heard footsteps behind her, so when she turned she saw that it was Wile. Sophie: (Smiling) Hey, Wile. Wile: (Smiling back) Hello, my dear. Wile sat down next to Sophie, and joined her at watching the stars. They spent a hour at star-gazing, just enjoying the silence, before Wile spoke up. Wile: Sophie? Sophie: (Turning towards him) Hmm? Wile: I have two questions. May I ask them? Sophie: Sure. Wile: (Smirking) First question. Is it true that you sleep with a plush version of me? Sophie felt her entire body heat up as her eye's went wide she panicked. Sophie: (Blushing and panicking) W-W-W-Who told you that?! Wile: Bugs let it out in his sleep. Sophie started grumbling threats at the rabbit making Wile laugh. Sophie: (Grumbling) Yeah. It's true. Wile: Splendid. Now the second question. Might I confess something? Sophie was curious, so she looked at him with still a faint blush on her face. Sophie: Sure. Wile took a deep breath before letting it out. Wile: When I first met you, I thought I saw a beautiful angel that has came down from heaven after hearing out plea. But as days went by as you spent time with us while practicing for the game, or just having fun with us. I realized that you are not a angel, but a goddess, who would do anything to keep us from harm. Plus, during those few days, it had me realize that...I have fallen in love with you, my dear. Sophie was frozen with shock. Wile E. Coyote, her favorite Looney Tune is in love with her. Her heart began to thump against her ribcage as it started beating really fast. Plus, she felt like she was about to burst with joy. Wile sighs, lowers his head while closing his eyes. Wile: But. I understand if you don't feel the same way. Wile was waiting to be rejected. He had always thought that with him, being nerdy. He would never find someone to love. He didn't want to be alone anymore. The coyote felt a paw on his cheek as it turn his head, he then suddenly felt something pressed against his lips. His eyes shot open to see the source is that Sophie is KISSING him. He closed his eyes, and without breaking the kiss, he brought her into his arms and lap. He wrapped his arms around her as she wrapped her around his neck. After a few moments, they had to stop for air. The new couple smiled at each other with love. Sophie: You have no idea...how long...I've waited to do that. They laughed as they felt the happiness between the two of them. Sophie: (Softly) I love you...Wile E. Coyote. Wile: (Softly) As I love you...Sophie Smith. The coyote then picked up the wolf girl up, bridle style and carried her inside the mansion. They didn't notice Nawt had seen this touching moment and he left with a sneer.[Chapter 11] The next night in Looney Tune Land, Toons were stuck in traffic trying to get to the stadium for the big basketball game, the fight for the ton's freedom. in the locker room, Lola wrapped tape around her hand, Bugs put his shorts on, Elmer Fudd wrapped a blue headband around his head, and Taz tried to get into his uniform, only to spin and tear it up, making him look frightening. Wile was slamming his fists at a large punching bag with determination in his eyes. He just got the canine of his dreams, so he is going to go all out, so he can have a life with her. Sylvester and Tweety were jumping rope, and Tweety put black marks on each of his cheeks to make him look serious. Daffy wore a ridiculous costume to try and look heroic. Daffy: Just get out of my way. Sophie was wearing her own Toon Squad (Sophie's name for them) uniform. She wore it like Lola making her look hot. When Wile saw her, there were hearts in his eyes and his was panting like a dog. Sophie giggled at this, and decided to shut her love's mouth. Sophie: Come on, love. We got a game to win. Bugs saw this and had to say something. Bugs: So. You and Wile are together? Every Looney Tune snapped their heads towards the canine couple with faces full of shock. Wile wrapped a arm around her shoulder as she smiled and nodded at him. Bugs: Finally! Sophie Giggled, and addressed the team. Sophie: Everybody, Ready? Looney Tunes: Yes, Ma'am! Sophie: Then, let's go! In the stadium, toons were cheering before the game started. Swackhammer was seated in a booth with a good view, and the Nerdluck slaves were watching. Swackhammer: I like it! I can see everything from here. Inside the announcement box, the announcer was asleep, but Hubie and Bertie grabbed a hold of the microphone and decided to do the announcing. Bertie: Okey-doke, ready to go? Hubie: Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Right! Ahem! (Big Voice) Ladies and gentlemen. The stating line-up for the Toon Squad! Standing 2ft. 4, the wonder of down under, the Tazmanian Devil! Taz made his entrance, tossing two basketballs into the air, then grabbing them with his mouth, popping them in the process, then spun off. Hubie: At small forward standing a scintillating 3ft. 2, the heartthrob of the hoops, Lola Bunny! The audience hooted, cheered, and whistled at her. Lola received a ball from a fan, dribbled and tossed it, and spun it on her finger. Hubie: At power forward, the Quackster of the Court, Daffy Duck! Daffy: (Comes out) Thank you, thank you! But, the audience remained silent and the only sound being made was a cricket chirping. Daffy: (Sarcastically) Very funny. Let's all laugh at the duck! Hubie: And the point guard, stand 3 ft. 3, 4 ft. If you include ears, Co-captain of the Toon Squad, the Doctor of Delight, Bugs Bunny! The audience was clapping 'We Will Rock You' in the process. Everyone held up a sign that said WE LOVE BUGS while they put headbands of grey ears on their heads. Bugs was underneath the floor of the gym and he popped out. Bugs: Thank you, thank you! The only ones that were booing him at him were the Nerdlucks, who were watching with Swackhammer. Hubie: And now, the coach and captain of the Toon squad, a young lady with popular talents and a cartoon lover, Sophie Smith. Sophie ran out to her teammates with the audience, cheering for her. She then threw her head back and howled, making Wile and all the other canine cartoons in the audience howl along with her. Swackhammer: Who? Is she a Looney Tune? Nerdluck: (Stammers) Uh-well, perhaps... The Toon Squad gathered into a huddle. Sophie put her paw out and the toons placed their paws on top of hers. Sophie: Ready? Daffy: Let's take it to the rack, Jack! Tweety: Those Monstars will wish they've never been born! Sophie: Let's do this! Looney Toons: YEAH! Hubie: The challengers for the ultimate game, all the way from Moron Mountain, the Monstars! The toons turned around to see the five horrid Monstars stomping out and show off, with the Nerdlucks cheering and audience booing. They glared at Sophie, who glared back at them. Bang: What are you looking at? Pound growled at Taz, who passed out. Sophie walked to the center of the court with Blanko. Blanko: Cool outfit. Marvin the Martian, who was the referee, walked up with the ball as Sophie looked down on him. Marvin: Ready? The buzzer started as he tossed the ball into the air. Blanko and Sophie jumped up to reach it. Sophie smacked the ball away from him easily and Bugs caught the ball. Bugs: I got it, I got it! I got the ball, I got the ball! But, Bang backhanded Bugs really hard, sending him to the floor. Sophie checked to see if he was ok. Sophie: Are you alright? Bugs: (Dazed) Did we lose? Sophie: It's two to nothing. Bugs: (Dazed) Oooh, close game. When the rabbit regained his senses, he glared at the Monstars. Bugs: Of course. You realize this means war! Pound received the ball and dunked, scoring two points for his team. Swackhammer cheered. Swackhammer: Way to go boys! Did you see the moves on that one? Marvin tossed the ball to Taz, and then he passed it to Sophie. She was dribbling the ball and the Monstars surrounded her. She tossed the ball to Daffy, who caught it. Bupkus: The duck! He and the other Monstars started to gang up on him. Daffy tossed the ball to the bench, where Granny was sitting. Granny caught it and the Monstars dog-piled on her. Sophia winced. Granny was ok, but she had Tweety birds flying around her head. Lola glared at Daffy, who made an excuse. Daffy: She was wide open! Pound tossed the ball over to Nawt. Nawt intercepted Lola and passed it to Bupkus, who dunked and scored. Now Sophie had the ball and was dribbling it to the other side. Nawt tried to block, but she went past him and made a basket, earning her team two points. The Nerdlucks were giving Swackhammer a massage and he looked at Sophie's score. Swackhammer: How did he do that? (He pounds his fist on the table) Porky: Nice shot! Sophie: Get back on defense! Nawt passed the ball to Bupkus, who scored. Swackhammer: Way to go! Bugs: Sophie, heads up! He tossed the ball to Sophie, who caught it. She was about to move to the other side, when the Monstars surrounded her. Monstars: Red light! Tweety: Feed me! Feed me! Sylvester: (Grabs Tweety) Feed you? Feed me! (Stuffs Tweety in his mouth) Sophie: We don't have time for this! She threw the ball to Sylvester, hitting him in the stomach, making him spit Tweety out. Tweety landed on the floor with the ball. Tweety: Bad ol' putty tat. Pound: (Picks up the ball) I'll take that, thank you. Sophie helped Sylvester up while shaking her head at him, then turned to see Pound dribble the ball to the basket. Pound: Don't try this at home! He dunked the ball, earning some points. Foghorn got the ball and was dribbling the ball, singing to himself, when bang blocked his path. Bang: Going somewhere? Foghorn: May I remind you, sir. That physical violence is against... Bang took a deep breath, arched his neck, and blew fire out of his mouth. Foghorn was burnt to a crisp and quoted the old KFC saying. Foghorn: Did you order Original Recipe or Extra Crispy? (Dissolves into ashes) Sophie went over to the bench to pick another player. Sophie: Come on. Sniffles: Me? Oh boy! I'm ready! I can do this! (runs out to the court) Sylvester, Taz, Elmer, and Wile looked on, but Sylvester and Wile snickered. But they stopped with a glare from Sophie. They watched Sniffles run out to the court to talk to Blanko, who was holding the ball. He kept talking really fast about basketball until Blanko dropped the ball and it squashed Sniffles like a bug. The audience pitted Sniffles. Lola made her way to the basket, where Pound and Bang blocked her. Pound: Try to get by me, Doll. Lola: Doll? She jumped up and dribbled Pound's face with her feet and dunked. The Toon Squad at the bench cheered. Lola: (To Pound) Don't ever call me...Doll. Bugs: (Gives Lola a high five) Nice shot! Lola: Thanks Bugs. Yosemite Sam has Bang at gunpoint while Bupkus dribbled the ball and dunked, while Pound held Sophia back. Swackhammer was getting more and more excited, while the Nerdlucks were serving him dinner. The game went on and the Monstars were beating the Toons. Toon Squad: 18 and the Monstars: Kinda one-sided isn't it? Then, Pound made his way to the hoop, jumped with a roar, and slammed the ball into the hoop. The buzzer went off and Marvin fired a pistol. Marvin: Half-time! The bullet blew a hole Sylvester's stomach and Tweety flew through it. Tweety: Holy Putty Tat! The Monstars high-fived each other and gave the Toons mean smiles. The Toons walked away to their locker room with their heads down in defeat. Sylvester: Moron Mountain: Here we come. Elmer: We're gonna be slaves. Sophie: (Hits a wall with her fist) Darn it! Wile walks to her and holds her in his arms as she laid her head on his shoulder. Wile: It will be okay, my dear. Sophie: (Shakes her head) No it is not! You are gonna be slaves because of...(She sees the Monstars heading to their locker room) Wait here! (Runs after the them.) Wile: (Shouts) Sophie! The Monstars broke the door to their locker room and ran inside. They were filled with glee for their victory and were giving each other hive-fives and head noggins. The celebration was cut short, when someone entered the room. Bupkus: It's the boss. Swackhammer was in the room, smoking a cigar. The Monstars pulled out smiles and greeted him. Monstars: Hello, Mr. Swackhammer. Swackhammer: Alright. Not bad for the first half, but we gotta keep this up! Pound: Hey, no problem. We stole... Nawt: We stole the best talent from the best players in the NBA! Sophie was next to the door as she heard everything. Sophie: (Whispering) It was them! Swackhammer brushed Nawt away roughly right after he rapidly named the five NBA players. Swackhammer: But, what I want to know is what to do about that wolf. Bang: She is the one training those Loonies for the game. Bukpus: That girl gave us trouble, days ago. Nawt: She is real close with the toons, I saw them hanging out and having fun together and getting cozy with them. I even saw her kissing that coyote. Swackhammer: Really? But is she a Looney Tune? I don't remember seeing her in the cartoons before. Where did she come from? It's as if he got his answer, when the little TV hanging on the wall in the corner was broadcasting the disappearance of Sophia. Reporter: Have you seen this missing teenager? Her name is Sophie Smith, daughter of Rose Smith. She has disappeared days ago while playing in the park. The girl is eighteen years old. If you have any information about the whereabouts of Sophie Smith, contact the authorities. Now learning the truth, Swackhammer switched off the TV, with a devious expression on his face. Sophia quietly as she can be ran to inform the others.[Chapter 12] In the locker room, Sophie told the team everything that she that she found out. They got depressed even more. She tried giving them a pep talk, but it did not lift their spirits a little. Porky: I think, we should q-qui...forfeit. The Toons agreed, but Sophie would not let them. Sophie: You guys can't! You gotta fight with everything you have! Please don't quit! But the Toons fell asleep and snored loudly. Lola was the only one listening. Lola: Well. How are we supposed to do that? Bugs: (Walks over) You finished? Great speech and all, Doc; you had them riveted. Buy, eh, didn't ya forget something? Sophie: What? The rabbit held out a bottle with a label that said 'MY SECRET STUFF', indicating that it was supposed to have come from Sophie. He guzzled the water down his throat and, just as the toons woke up, they were stunned to see Bugs, taller and muscular. The Toons were impressed. Lola: Wow! Daffy: Whoa! Nice deltoids! Bugs: (Flexes a muscle and winks at Sophie) Play along. Sophie took the bottle and examined it. Bugs tugged the bottle from her. Bugs: Hey, stop hogging' it, kid! We're your teammates! The bottle flew out of Sophie's paw and it landed near Porky, who took a swig. Elmer: Secret Stuff? (Took a sip) Sylvester: You wouldn't hold out on us, would ya? Sophie: (Dawg takes a swig) Oh no. I though you were tough without it. Foghorn: We're also chicken, honey. We need it bad. Foghorn got in between Sylvester and Wile fighting over the bottle and took the bottle and drank it. Sylvester: Hey! Wile: I have a girlfriend that I plan to spend my life with. So, give me that! But, Foghorn tossed the bottle to Daffy, who caught it. Daffy: Ya know, this goes against everything that they've taught me in health class. Sophie: (Annoyed) You wanna win? Daffy: Bottoms up. He guzzled the bottle until there was nothing left. Sophie: Alright, are you ready to save your butts? Looney Tunes: YEAH! The toons in the stadium cheered as the Toon Squad ran out onto the court, with looks of determination in their eyes, although Wile had more determination than everybody, Sophie knew that he wants to win this, so that he and she can be together, and she wants that too. They face the Monstars, finally standing up for them, growling in their faces. Daffy faced off against Bang, Taz and Porky snarled, Bupkus growled as Sophie growled like a feral wolf. Bugs gave a steely, but confident expression. Bang threw the ball to Pound. But, Bugs rode a mechanical scooter and stole the ball from him. Sophie ran on ahead, following after Bugs. The bunny stooped his scooter and tossed the ball over his shoulder. Bugs: Special delivery! Sophie caught the ball and shot it into the hoop. Everyone cheered and Swackhammer booed. Bupkus dribbled the ball and was about to dunk the ball. When he saw the hoop covered with explosives. Then, the hoop exploded, while Wile, Sophie, and Bugs stood there watching. Wile was holding a remote that caused the explosion. Bugs: Nice kaboom, Wile. Sophie: (Kissed Wile's cheek) You did great, Wile. Wile: (Flattered) Thank you, my dear. Then, Bupkus angrily grabbed Wile, about to finish him off, but then his teeth got shot out. He saw Elmer and Sam dressed like the Men in Black and holding pistols. Sophie dribbled the ball across the court with Bang and Nawt behind her. She tossed the ball in the air, Bang and Nawt tried to knock it away, but the ball made it's way into the basket. Later, Blanko tossed the ball to Pound. Then, Sylvester appeared, carrying a fishing rod and flung the hook onto Pound's shorts and gave it a yank. Pound's shorts came off and his butt was showing. Pound covered his butt with his jersey while his face turned red with embarrassment. Lola: Nice Butt! The audience was laughing. Sophie looked at Wile, who was next to her and looked over his body before her eyes drifted to his behind. She snapped her face to his face, when she heard a growl. He was grinning at her, like she was a piece of meat. Wile: (Wolfishly Grinning) Keep looking at me like that my dear, and I won't hold back later. Sophie frozen as she felt her entire body felt as hot as a volcano as it turned red. She shook her head, and turned her attention to the game, completely aware that Wile was still staring at her with the grin of his. The game continued. Taz dunked the ball with ease. Sophie rode on Roadrunner's back and tossed the ball into the hoop, while avoiding Pound and Bupkus. Foghorn and Sylvester got Porky on top of their shoulders and Porky dunked the ball and hit Pound's head. The toons were gaining and the Monstars were still at the top, with the same score. Granny and Witch Hazel were cheering on the bench. The Monstars took the ball and made their way over, that is until Sophie, Bugs, Tweety, and Foghorn came with masks on their faces and Pepe le Pew standing in front of them. Pepe: Hello. A little surprise for you, my friends. His stench made the Monstars pass out. Pepe kissed the ball as he made a basket. Pepe: Two points. The game continued on as Sophie scored another basket. Swackhammer's eyes turned red and growled furiously. Daffy painted Pound's butt red. A bull from the audience saw the red paint and became angry. The Toons moved out of the way as the bull rammed his horns into Pound, causing him to scream and fly up into the ceiling. Tweety fluttered along the court until the Monstars surrounded him. Bang: Hey, birdy! Tweety: Uh-oh! Sophie: (Panicking) Tweety, watch out! The Monstars closed in on him, but Tweety did a karate yell and started beating them up, rather violently. Sophie: (Stunned) Never mind. Then, Elmer jumped in the air and dunked the ball. The Monstars groaned in defeat. The crowd cheered until Swackhammer silenced them. Swackhammer: TIME OUT! The buzzer went off as Swackhammer made his way over to the court and Marvin tried to stop him. Marvin: Excuse me, but I tell the Earthlings, when to- But, Swackhammer grabbed him by the head and flung him away. Swackhammer: Shut up, you little bug! Get away from me! Pow wow! The Toon Squad took a time-out for the 4th quarter. The Toons were getting excited at winning. Sophie: I'm so proud of you all! (Kisses Wile) Wile: (Breaking the Kiss) You did great, my dear. Swackhammer: (Points to Sophie) Why didn't you get her? Bukpus: She is a human is disguise, remember? Nawt: Yeah Boss! She's too quick for us! Swackhammer: I want her out of the way! Those Looney Tunes are the ones, I want for Moron Mountain! Sophie: Seems to me, that someone is being a sore loser. Sophie was standing in the center of the court, with Wile, Bugs, Lola, Daffy, Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz beside her. Swackhammer: Are you talking to me? Sophie: (Glares) You want a piece of me? Chuckling, Swackhammer approached the group. Bukpus sneered am 'Uh oh'. Swackhammer: What did you have in mind, girl? Sophie: How about we raise the stakes a little bit. Swackhammer: Hmm. Interesting. Sophie: If we win, you give the NBA players their talents back. Swackhammer: But, what if we win? Sophie: If you win...you get me. Wile, Bugs, and the others gasped in horror. Sophie: (Extends her hand) Deal? Swackhammer: Deal! Swackhammer took Sophie's hand and squeezed it. They let go of each other's hands and the Toons went back to the bench. Lola: I can't believe you did that! Sylvester: Are you crazy, Sophie! You wanna go and work in that mess up theme park of theirs! Daffy: You're crazy! Bugs: Why did you do that, kiddo? Sophie: I have faith in this team. Tweety: I'm starting to lose faith, already. Sophie: I'm sorry. But, I rather that I go in your place, then seeing you suffer under his tyranny. Taz: (Sobs) Sophie! Best friend! Lola: That is so sweet of you. Sylvester: (Sobs) Why do you have to be so kind to us! No one's ever done that for us in a long time! Wile: (Puts a hand on Sophie's cheek) I will not allow that retched man to take you away from us, or even me. Sophie: (Leans into Wile's hand) I just want you, guys. To be free. Wile: (Gathers Sophie in his arms and places his head on hers) Then, we will fight for your freedom. Looney Tunes: Yeah! Sophie: (Nestling into Wile's chest while smiling) Thank you. Swackhammer looked back and his face hardened. He would have his team win, even if they have to beat the Toons harshly. Swackhammer: CRUSH 'EM! Marvin blew the whistle and the game continued. Wile got the ball and dribbled his way over, but the Monstars stampeded towards him. They trampled over him, causing his body to fall to pieces. Bang and Bupkus did a butt-slam on poor Porky, Sylvester dribbled the ball, but Pound crushed him with his foot. Bupkus used his elbow to pin Elmer down, Bang used his fist and hit Foghorn in the face, and Nawt kicked Taz in the stomach. Bupkus used Foghorn as a golf club and Tweety as a golf ball. He swung Foghorn and hit poor Tweety away to the bleachers. The, Bupkus squashed Daffy with his hand and looked at his palm. When Daffy came to, he was dazed. Daffy: But Mommy, I don't wanna go to school today. I wanna stay home and bake cookies with you. He clung to Bupkus' head and the alien ripped him off his head, making his face all misshaped and mixed up. Meanwhile, Lola was at the basketball hoop, but she didn't notice that Pound was climbing onto the hoop. Bugs noticed what was about to happen and called out to her. Bugs: Lola! Lola, heads up! Lola looked up just to see Pound coming down on her. She was about to get crushed, when Bugs shoved her out of the way and got crushed instead. Sophie was watching her boyfriend and friends getting beat up, and she couldn't take it anymore. Sophie: TIME OUT! The whistle blew as Lola tumbled to the side of the court and picked herself up, when She saw Bugs' struggling hand emerge from the huge alien over him. Lola: (Gasps) Oh my! Bugs! (Audience gasps) Bugs! Pound: Is this your man? As she got up and left, Bugs was flat as a pancake until his body became normal. Lola knelt down beside him to see if he was alright. Sophie rushed over to them, and knelt down next to them. Sophie: (Worried) Bugs? Lola: Are you ok? Bugs: Me? Oh yeah. I'm fine. Are you ok? Lola: Oh Bugs. Thank you. Bugs: Oh, it was nothing. Lola: That was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Then, Lola gave him a big long kiss and walked away, leaving a dumb grin on Bugs' face and had hearts in his eyes. Sophie looked over to the bench to see that the Toon Squad was a mess. Their injuries looked very gruesome due to the Monstars' brutality, and it made Sophie feel so guilty and so much pain, it brought tears to the wolf girl's eyes. Sophie: (Tearing up) This is all my fault.[Chapter 13] Sophie was pacing back and forth on the court, trying to think of a plan. If they don't win, they everyone goes to Moron Mountain. She didn't know what to do. Daffy: Hey coach? Listen you got anymore of that secret stuff? I think it's starting to wear off. Sophie: (Giggles) Daffy,it didn't wear off; t was just water. You guys had the secret inside of you all along. Daffy: (Shrugs) Yeah,i knew that. But listen, you got anymore? Everyone else started asking, but Sophie rolled her eyes. Then she got a plan. Sophie: Everyone! Huddle up! Her team ran towards her and huddled up. Sophie: Here's the plan. Daffy! Daffy: (Salutes) Yes? Sophie: You toss the ball to Lola. Lola, you dish it back to Bugs. Lola: Gust! Wile: Sophie! We're on defense! Bugs: Oh yeah. Sophie: OK. New plan. Somebody steal the ball, give it to me, and I'll score it before the time runs out. Bugs: Don't lose that confidence guys! We have to win this! OK, paws and wings in here! They placed their hands on top of each other, and headed to their positions. But then, Sophie had another idea, so she called over Daffy. Sophie: Daffy, come over here. Daffy: (Walks over to her) What is it, Toots? Sophie: You see that chunky ape, over there? She pointed at Pound, who smirked at Lola. Daffy nodded and Sophie whispered the plan in his ear. Daffy nodded. Daffy: Uh-huh. Ooh, that's good! Sophie: (Done whispering the plan.) Let's do this. Daffy: (Nods) Right! Marvin: (Gives the ball to Bupkus) Now. Let's all play fair, here. But, Bupkus rudely smacked him with his elbow. Daffy put on a football helmet and got into charging position. Daffy: It's gut-check time! Bupkus tossed the ball to Pound, and he caught it. At the same time, Daffy charged at Pound, flew to stomach, causing him to drop the ball. Sophie took the ball and distracted the Monstars. Sophie: This must be mine! Wile, I'm going left! Wile: Give me the ball! (Sophie gives him the ball) Sophie: Don't ever trust an Earthling, boys! Wile threw the ball to Lola, who dribbled it, and was surrounded by Bang and Blanko. Bang: Get the girl! Daffy: C'mon, c'mon! I'm open! I'm o- But, Bugs got in the way and used his ears to catch the ball and tossed it to Sophie. Blanko: Bring it on. Sophie teasingly held the ball out to him, then stuck her leg out to make Blanko trip. She tossed the ball to Daffy, who was getting close to the basket, until Pound came up from behind. Pound: You're mine! In slow motion, Daffy was about to toss the ball, when Pound came down. crushing him. The audience and the Toon Squad gasped in horror. But, the ball popped out and Sophie caught it. Swackhammer: (Points at Sophie) Crush her, boys! The Toon Squad heard this and was horrified as the Monstars came at the Wolf girl. Wile: SOPHIE! Sylvester: OH NO! Tweety: LOOK OUT! Sophie stared at the oncoming Monstars. She stood there, wide-eyed and trembling in fear. Lola: Sophie, snap out of it! Bugs: C'mon, toots! It's all up to you, now! The wolf girl looked at her teammates on the court, then to her teammates by the bench; they were shouting and encouraging her. Sophie looked at the ball, and then the basket. She had to make that shot. She had to win the game and save her friends. They had faith in her, they believed in her. Determination flashed in her eyes. Just as Bang was about to catch her, Sophie dodged his attack. As she dribbled towards the basket, Nawt tried to grab her, but Sophie did a summersault in the air and over his head, slid under Blanko's legs, punching Bang in the face as he came down at her. As she got closer to the basket, Bupkus towered over. With the force of a wolf, Sophie rammed into Bupkus, climbed up to his head, and leapt forward to the basket and slammed the ball into the hoop, just as the timer buzzed. The audience screamed and applauded, and Swackhammer's eyes popped out, when he saw the scoreboard. Toon Squad; 78 and Monstars; 77. The Toon Squad won. The Toons cheered, Bugs and Lola embraced, and Daffy shouted with joy. Sophie let's go of the hoop and dropped to the ground. Hubie: THE TOONS WIN! Sophie looked at all the toons in the stands with a big smile on her face as they cheered and applauded for her. Sophie was so happy to see so many toons cheering for her. She was finally appreciated for her talent and got the respect and friendship from her, new friends. She looked back at the team, but instead saw a certain toon rushing over to her. Her smile got bigger as she ran towards him. Sophie: WILE! Wile: SOPHIE! The two met up in the center of the court, and as soon as they were at arms' length, Wile grabbed Sophie and spun her around as the couple laughed in pure joy. After a few moments of spinning, Wile put Sophie back on her feet, and placed his forehead on hers. Sophie: (Smiling Radiantly) We did it! Wile: (Smiling Fondly) No. You did it. Sophie, then kissed her coyote with passion, as he equally returned it and their eyes closed. Completely, aware that everyone was staring at them. Audience: AWWWWWWWWW! The canine couple broke the kiss, and smiled at each other, right before the rest of the team rushed over to them and grabbed them in a group hug. During their victory celebration, Pepe went and kissed a confused Granny. Bugs: That was amazing! Lola: You were incredible! Daffy: Way to go, toots! Sophie: guys, come on. You're making me blush. As for the Monstar team, Swackhammer was berating them for losing. Swackhammer: Losers! Monstars: Sorry. Swackhammer: Choke artists! Monstars: Sorry, again. Swackhammer: Wait' til I get you back on Moron Mountain! He stomped on Bupkus' foot, causing her to howl in pain. The wolf girl saw this and felt bad for the Monstars. Sophie: (To her team) Come with me. Sophie and the team walked over to the Monstars team. Sophie: (Glares) You've got a real attitude problem. You out to learn a little respect for your employees! Swackhammer: I wouldn't worry about employees, if I were you, unless you wanna reconsider becoming one! (To the Toon Squad) Alright, the party's over! Get in the space ship! Sophie: (Glaring and Growling) No! We had a deal, remember! Swackhammer: (Glaring) Shut up! This is all your fault, brat! You're coming with too! When, we get back on Moron Mountain, I'll have my revenge! Sophie: (Turns to the Monstars) Why do you take it from this guy? You do realize that you are bigger than him, right? Pound: We are? That's when they realized that Sophie is right about them being bigger than their boss. They should be getting some respect from him. They turned their heads towards Swackhammer, who noticed their behavior. Swackhammer: What are you doing? The Monstars grabbed Swackhammer and stuffed him into an ACME rocket. Bugs, Sophie, and Wile grinned as Swackhammer was blasted away. As Swackhammer crashed through the ceiling, he flew all the way to the moon, never to be seen again. The Toon Squad and audience cheered. Sophie: You had it in you, all this time. Didn't you? The Monstars smiled and shrugged. Sophie: (Picks up the basketball) One more thing. You have to give the NBA players, their talent back. Pound: Do we have to? Sophie: Yes. Touch the ball. The Monstars gave sad looks and placed their hands on the ball. It started to sparkle and glow, and the Monstars started shaking. As the shaking stopped, they shrank back into Nerdlucks. They pooped out from their clothes. Bupkus: That was so much fun. Bang: I feel so, insignificant. Pound: My clothes don't fit. Nawt: What a trip. Blanko: I'm up for another one. Pound: Could we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny. We don't wanna go back to Moron Mountain. Bang: We hate it up there. Nawt: It stinks. Blanko: Um, I was thinking like, could we stay here with you? Bupkus: And, no hard feelings, eh? Nerdlucks: (Big smiles) Pleeeease? Daffy: Oh, brother. Bugs: Eh, I don't know, if you guys are Looney enough. Bang: Looney enough? A curtain opened and the Nerdlucks were dressed as the toons, and did a little dance, involving an explosion at the end. Something dawned on Sophie, causing her to panic. Sophie: (Panicking) Guys! I have to get home! I have been gone way too long, and my mom is probably worried sick about me! Bugs: Eh, just go back the way that you came, and then you will be in the forest near your house. Sophie hurried to the bench, grabbed her bag from underneath it, and shoved the ball in the bag. She shouldered her bag and walked over to her friends. Sophie: (Smiling kindly) I wanted to thank you all. Nobody has ever appreciated me, back home. You all have made me feel special, ever since I was a little girl. You're the best friends that I can ever ask for. I will miss you guys. They all started to cry a little as She gave ever Looney Tune a hug, before saying something else. Sophie: Just because I am leaving it is not a goodbye. I would never abandon you guys. She then turns to Wile, who was next to her. Sophie: (Grinning) Care to walk me, home? Wile was shocked by this, he didn't think she would want him to come with. Wile: (Unsure) Are you certain? Sophie: (Nods and Grins) Yeah. Besides, I have to introduce you to my mom at one point, don't I? Wile was so happy that he grabbed Sophie and began planting kisses on her face, making her laugh. Bugs: (Smirking) Eh, I don't mean to interrupt. But, shouldn't you get going? Sophie giggled as she grabbed Wile's paw. The couple ran to the exit of the stadium, but before they opened it, Sophie turned back to Bugs. Sophie: Bugs? Bugs: Eh, Soph? Sophie: (Grins) Stay out of trouble. Then, she and Wile ran out of the stadium. Bugs: You know I will. (Lola giggles) C'mere! He then gave Lola a big kiss. When he lets go, Lola cheered, and then pulled down a different screen of the story. So, that she and Bugs continued kissing.[Chapter 14] Rose was sitting on the couch in the living room, reading one of her books from the Library. She had the phone next to her, just incase there was any news on Sophie. It was a few days, since she disappeared, and Rose was worried her daughter. If she was hurt, if she was sick. She didn't know. Her thoughts were broken by a knock at the backyard door. Rose placed her bookmark on the page that she was reading on, and placed the book on the couch. She got up went to the door, placed her hand on the knob, turned it, and opened it to see Sophie. Rose gasped as tears came to her eyes as she stared at her daughter, who was smiling sheepishly at her. Sophie: Hey mom. I hope that I am in time for dinner. Faster then she could blink, Sophie found herself in her mother's arms as she wept on Sophie's shoulder. She wrapped her arms around her mother to comfort her the best she can. They remained like that for a few minutes before they pulled out of the hug and Rose wiped her tears and gave her daughter a happy smile. Rose: Where were you, young lady? Sophie: (Sheepishly Smiled) Well... She looked to her right, and Wile appeared in the door, giving Rose a small smile, making the woman froze with shock. Rose: (Pointing at Wile) Sweetie...is that? Sophie giggled as Wile wrapped his arms around Sophie's waist, and placed his head on hers. Sophie: Yep. Wile E. Coyote. Also...he is my boyfriend. Rose stared at them for a moment, before laughing like a lunatic, and then falling unconscious on the floor and on her back. Sophie and Wile stared at Rose, with wide eyes. Sophie: That was better than I expected. It had been a busy few days for everyone. After Wile left, Sophie explained everything to her mother, who was still in disbelief about the entire thing, and since it brought her daughter great happiness with the Toons, Rose aloud Sophie to keep seeing her friends, and dating Wile. When Sophie went back to school, Katharine confronted her, and started running her mouth about how Sophie should of just stayed gone, but Sophie countered, saying that she can go to Katharine's parents and tell her about everything that their daughter has been doing to her. Katharine never bothered her again. Sophie went to a local gym, where she found the NBA stars, brooding. When she gave the ball from the game to them, they were amazed to find themselves, playing like they were before. Sophie and Wile's relationship was growing more and more, and Rose was seeing this, and was happy for Sophie. Sophie felt like she was in paradise. It was Saturday, Sophie was watching Looney Tunes on the television in the living room, she was watching a Wile and Roadrunner cartoon, it was funny as it always is. But at the end of every episode, Wile would face Sophie and blow her a kiss. Sophie: (Laughs) That coyote. A knock was at the front door. Sophie found an envelope that has been through the bottom of the door. She opened the envelope and read it. \" What's up, kiddo. We heard that you have graduated high school, and we though it was time to make you a honorary Looney Tune. If you want to say with us after everything you've done for us. Because, you valiantly put your life on the line to protect us. Right now, we're throwing a party at the Looney Ballroom and wanted to invite you to welcome you. Sincerely, Bugs Bunny.\" Half an hour later, Rose came back home to make dinner for Sophie, only to discover a letter written for her on the table. It was from Sophie. \" Dear Mom, Sorry for leaving without a goodbye. The Looney Tunes have offered me a job to work with them on their cartoons and to live with them. But I promise that I will visit you, when I can. Also, maybe sometimes I could bring Taz over for the two of you to meet, since he's your favorite Looney Tune. See ya, soon. Sophie Rose smiled as she read the letter, and after reading it, she looked towards the forest in the backyard. Rose: (Laughs) She will have a great time. Rose then thought of something as she put on a thinking face. Rose: I wonder how many grandchildren would I get from Sophie and Wile. It was nighttime in Looney Tune Land. Inside a large building, the Looney Ballroom, the Looney Tunes were getting down on the dance floor, moving to the rhythm of Coolio's The Winner. Bugs was dancing with Lola, Foghorn was tossing Miss Prissy in the air, Speedy did the Mexican hat dance, Taz was spinning and making moves on the dance floor, and Daffy was at the food table, munching snacks. Only Wile was outside of the building, looking at his watch, waiting impatiently to if his wolf would come to the party. Suddenly, something came hurling out through the sky and the WB portal. Wile watched as the figure in the sky opened an umbrella and slowly landed to the ground, right in front of Wile. He saw Sophie, wearing a stunning white prom dress with a halter top and her brown hair is flowing down her back. She had three suitcases filled with clothes, hairbrush, toothbrush, and all of her Looney Tunes stuff. Sophie: (Smile) Hey, Wile. Wile was mesmerized by the beauty standing in front of him as he walked over to her. Wile: (In awe) My dear...You look stunning. Sophie giggled. Wile: (Offering his arm and smiling) Shall we? Sophie: (Taking his arm) Yes. The doors parts parted open and the music stopped as the Toons turned around and gasped to see who it was standing at the door. Recognizing the female wolf, the Looney Tunes rushed over and engulfed with warm hugs. Seeing how happy the gang is now that Sophie has arrived, Bugs instructed the Nerdlucks to play their welcoming song. The Nerdlucks put in a different CD into the radio and 'Show Me How You Burlesque' played loudly on the speakers. The Looney Tunes wen back to dancing, with Sophie joining a dance with Wile, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy. Wile grabbed Sophie and twirled her around and then into his arms. They stared at each other for a few moments, before sharing a passionate kiss between the two of them. As the window beside them, showed the night sky, with the moon shining brightly and a shooting star passed the moon. After the End Credits Bugs Bunny pulls the credits screen off and talks to the viewers. Bugs: Well, that's all folks! Porky: Th-th-that's my line! Th- Daffy: Step aside babe! Let a star do this! That's all- He was suddenly pushed and fell off the screen as the Nerdlucks say farewell. Nerdlucks: That's all folks! Sophie and Wile stuck their heads out, with Sophie in her wolf form. Sophie: Thanks for watching! Wile: Goodbye the characters disappear and THAT\"S ALL FOLKS is written on the screen.[Chapter 15] Cast Demi Lovato as Sophie Smith Helena Bonham Carter as Rose Smith John Paul Karliak as Wile E.

Memphis Grizzlies Press Conference 2016: In the Memphis Grizzlies press conference, Shawn Matthews is now a NBA Basketball player and he's wearing cornrows. Shawn talking about become a free agent next season and going to Rio de Janeiro to play in the 2006 Olympics for basketball.

The camera pans past the sign which says \"Amusement Park.\" There is a planet that says \"Moron Mountain.\" It is an alien theme park where the aliens go to, the park had a lot of rides and it had an alien head as an entrance. We see the ride with a robot alien zapping ships around it. It continues zapping until it got on target and the ship flies and then it lands on the parking lot and the two aliens are unharmed, but the kid is not happy with his dad. Alien Kid: (Bored) Let's get out of here, Dad. This stinks. Don't bring me here anymore, all right? Then the alien kid is being monitored by an green dog like alien he is short, obese he wears a magenta business suit and a pink shirt this is Mr Swackhammer the owner of Moron Mountain and his minions are small insectoid aliens called Nerdlucks they wear bowties.

Duck!, To Beep or Not to Beep, What's Opera Doc?, Rabbit of Seville and more. Mr Swackhammer: (Smiling excitedly) Yes Looney! Yes! Now you're talking! Looney, that's it, that's the word I was looking for! (Bupkus looks up at him smiling and giggling excitedly) Looney, Get the Looney Tunes! Bupkus: (Jumping up Happily) Looney Tunes!

The camera zooms away from Moron Mountain. Mr. Swackhammer plans is to find the Looney Tunes and take them to the Moron Mountain for the new attraction. This plan is no good.

The tunes just rolled their eyes what Nawt said. Road Runner: (Annoyed) What a waste of time. (Laughing) Witch Lezah: (Annoyed) My goodness. I have no idea what they talking about. Gossamer: (snickering) They wouldn't dare to capture us. Daffy Duck: Oh fear, clutches to my breast. (Laughing with the tunes and Yosemite Sam jumps on stage) Yosemite Sam: (Firing his guns) We ain't a-going nowheres! Sam points his gun at Pound, but Pound pulls his laser gun and zaps Sam. Sam's clothes, hat, and guns are gun, he is in his underwear and charred. Daffy and all of the other tunes put their hands up. The Nerdlucks point their lasers at them. Bugs Bunny: Eh, not so fast doc. (Taking the chains off him) You can't just turn us into slaves that would be bad. You've gotta give us a chance to defend ourselves. Pound: Oh yeah? (Pointing his gun at Bugs) Who says? Nawt: Says who? Bupkus: What? Bugs Bunny: (Writing a note) Just a sec. (Shows them a book that says, \"How to Capture Cartoon characters?\") There read em and weep boys. Pound takes the book and they see a note that says \"Give them a chance to defend themselves.\" Blanko: What's this? Nawt: Huh?

Porky Pig: (Raising his hand) Oh, I-I g-got it. Bugs Bunny: Yes, Private Porkster? Porky Pig: How about we challenge them to a spelling bee? Elmer Fudd: Say, we \"couwd\" have a \"bowwing touwnament\". (Chucking) Gossamer: Possibly a Football game. Wile E. Coyote: I took a liberty, I suggest to challenge against those tiny aliens to cricket. Road Runner: Or Maybe to the olympics like track and field. Sylvester: Suffering Succotash! What's wrong with all of ya? I say we get a ladder. (Imagines his plan about Tweety) Wait til the old lady's out of the room, then grab the little bird. Sylvester pretends he has Tweety and wheezes. Bugs Bunny: (Calming Sylvester) Whoa, whoa. Take a deep breath, Sly. (Sylvester calms down, pants and nodding his head) Okay, Let's anaylze the competition here. (Pulls down the chart of the Nerdlucks) Now, what are looking at here? We got a small race of invading aliens. Daffy Duck: Small arms, short legs. (Pretending to be a Nerdluck) Elmer Fudd: Not \"vewy\" fast. Wile E. Coyote: Not very big enough. Sylvester: Tiny little guys. Gossamer: Those alien aren't tall enough. Road Runner: Don't have the athletic experience. Porky Pig: Can't jump high. Tunes: (In unison) Uh-huh. (Smiling) They pull up the chart and go outside to the Nerdlucks. Bugs has a basketball with him as he looks at them. Bugs Bunny: We challenge you to a basketball game. (Spins the ball around with his finger) Pound: All right basketball it is! Bang: Basketball! Nawt: Basketball! (Jumping and clapping happily) Bupkus: Oh boy, Oh boy. (Wags his tail happily) Blanko: (Excited) All right! (Confused) What is basketball? Bupkus: (Shrugging) What's that? Nawt: Beats me. Bang: We didn't have that in school. Pound: I have no idea. Bupkus: What? Bugs Bunny: Lights, Camera, Action! The lights turn off as the movie starts, Foghorn is trying to find the seat and he's in the way of everyone's view. Foghorn Leghorn: Pardon me. Sorry. Wile E. Coyote: (Cupping his hand to his mouth and yelling) I beg your pardon! Do you mind to sit down, Mr. Leghorn! Barnyard Dawg: Allow me, Coyote. Hey! Down in front! (Throws his popcorn at Foghorn) The popcorn hits Foghorn in the head and falls down, the movie starts it shows basketball history.

The Timberwolves are training for this season including Kristaps Porzingis. Kristaps Porzingis shot three points. When the practice is over, the Knicks goes to the locker room. Pound: This is it. This is going to be the last one. (To Blanko) Blanko, can you step up? Blanko: Yeah. Pound: Who do you see? Blanko: I saw the russian dude shot the ball far away to the hoops.

Steve Kerr: Guys, we gotta get dressed. We got practice in 5 minutes. I mean, we're talking about a huge fine here. Kevin Durant: No way, coach Steve Kerr: Oh. Stephen Curry: You heard what happened to Embiid, Giannis and the others. It's got to be germs in there or something. Kevin Durant: Also, Ingram, Kristaps and Towns got theirs too. Klay Thompson: (Agreeing) Yeah, that's right. Steve Kerr: Steph, that was in Philadelphia 3,000 miles away and Milwaukee too. Draymond Green: Bacteria like that can travel than the speed of light. Klay Thompson: Yeah, it could be Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Kevin Durant: Yeah, could be. Steve Kerr: (Sighs) All right then, guys. Just dress in the hallway. Warriors: Okay. The Warriors put gas masks on as they prepare to go the locker room. Meanwhile back in Looney Tune Land the tunes are practicing basketball. Bugs Bunny: Okay, okay, now which one of you maroons have ever play basketball before? The Tunes murmur and Daffy steps in. Daffy Duck: I have coach, and there's an important strategic question I need to ask you. Bugs Bunny: Yes? Disco music plays as Daffy Duck did a fashion show he tried on random jerseys and the last one he's trying on a gold jersey, purple shorts, black sneakers, and green hair. Daffy Duck: What do you think? I'm kinda partial with purple and gold myself. It goes better with my coloring. Porky Pig: Hey guys. (To Daffy) Nice outfit, Daffy. (To Bugs) The little aliens say it's their turn to, uh, use the court. The Nerdlucks are working out but they did very bad. Wile E. Coyote: (Sigh and Annoyed) This is a waste of time. Road Runner: You said it, Wile E. There aren't ready anyway. (Laughing) Bugs Bunny: Yeah sure let the little pipsqueaks knock themselves out. Gossamer: (Snickering) I don't think those little aliens are to ready to play. Daffy Duck: Too bad you can't practice getting taller, boys. The Tunes laugh, as they leave the dark clouds appear in the sky Pound and Bang smile evilly as they hold up the bag, Bupkus, Blanko, and Nawt go to them as they open the bag a basketball glows with the talents inside it. They all touch the ball absorbing the talents into their bodies, the tunes turn around and see what's going on. Pound: (Smiling) Ahh! (He starts to feel strange then he began to grow big and strong, he laughs as he grew muscles) Bupkus started grow taller to his torso and chest got expanded, his arms and legs grew muscles and his hair popped out of his head. Nawt grew his arms, legs and grew muscles. But he is skinny as well. Blanko looks up at Pound then his feet start shaking and big sneakers appear then he zooms up and grows tall, Bang started to grow tall he groans in pain as he grew muscles and his spine got strong then the spikes pop out. He turns to face the audience with his eye staring at the audience as he chuckles then he roars like a beast.

They are humanoid muscular aliens they wear navy blue basketball uniforms with gold trim lines, white zeroes on their jerseys and matching navy blue sneakers they smiled evilly at the Tunes. Pound and Bang chuckled at them and their voices become deep and resounding. Blanko: (To Porky) Hey, little pig. (Bending down to Porky) Boo. Porky Pig: (Shrieking then Sheepishly) (stammering) I be-believe wet myself. (Smiled and blushed) Bang: Time to play a little basketball. (Yelling and he slammed the ball to the ground which causes an earthquake on the court the tunes run around until they get stuck in the middle, Foghorn, Elmer and Sam hug each other, Daffy, Road Runner, Wile E., Gossamer,Porky, and Sylvester looks up at them) Wile E. Coyote: With all do respect, gentlemen, but who is those hideous creature? Road Runner: They're so huge as well. Gossamer: They're ferocious beasts too. Daffy Duck: Those little pipsqueaks just turn to superstars. Porky Pig: They're (stammering) me- me- monsters. Sylvester: Suffering succotash! (Points at them) They're Monstars! Bang pops the basketball in his strong hand then they leave the court. Bupkus: Bye-Bye. As they leave they shake the ground and a hotel goes to the ground. Bugs Bunny: (Eating his carrot,to audience) Eh, I think we need a little bit of help. AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. Shawn, Derrick, Shelby, A.J., Terry and Aaron are going to the basketball court at the playground and they saw the news about five NBA Players' talent has been stolen by The Nerdlucks. And now, since they touched the ball was glowing, they transform into the ferocious beasts superstars aliens. They're no longer the Nerdlucks, now they are the MONSTARS! What will happened next?

Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. Shawn Matthews, his friends and his family are the OC Characters (I used five active NBA current players). But not characters from the movie that I owned. Back in the real world, Shawn is playing basketball at the playground park with A.J.,Terry, Aaron, Shelby and Derrick. Derrick: (Sighs and talking to the basketball ball) A'ight, little man. You my homeboy? Or are you my enemy? You are my friend, right? You are my ally. You are my associate, my personal assistant. You are my weapon. You are leaving. I'm going for the point line. (Shoots from the three point range and he made a shot) Nothing but net. Shawn: Hey. Great shot, little bro. A.J.: (Clapping) Mmm. Nice shot, D. He is still poses. Shelby: You can stop posing now. (Chuckling softly) Excellent. Aaron: Not bad. Not bad. (Walks in next) Derrick: (Walking up to Shawn) Something for you to shoot at. Terry: Shoot it good, Aaron. Aaron: I'll Do my best. Shawn: (To Derrick) It was a good shot. Derrick: Yeah, I know. Hey, Shawn, I gotta ask you something. The NBA and WNBA has to face reality. What's happening to these players is serious. Shelby: They're gonna need some new players with talent, guys and girls who are skilled but never really thought about a professional career before. (Thinks for a moment) You think Derrick and I got a shot? (Shawn shook his head) Come on, really? Shawn: Naw. Derrick: Come on, man. Don't play me like that. Shelby: Derrick and I just graduated from high school, we was playing basketball from high school and we won our championship. For girls varsity team, I won the championship and for boys varsity team, He won the championship too. What do you think? (Smiling) Shawn: Shelby, Derrick, listen, it's a big league's game, and y'all ain't ready. First, you gotta go to college and play basketball really hard. After that, if you good at it, (To Shelby) You can go to WNBA. (To Derrick) and you can go to NBA. Derrick: What if Shelby and I tried really hard? Aaron: Can you guys quiet down? I'm trying to concentrate to shoot the ball. Shelby: It's because I'm a girl isn't it? Shawn: (Scoffs) I didn't say that. What I meant was you don't got the experience. So what? Derrick: I see. But don't worry I'll make to the NBA one way or another. (Aaron shoots the ball) You got it, Aaron! Terry: Get inside this ball in the net. Aaron made the shot and it was nothing but a net. A.J.: (Impressed) Cool. Aaron: You guys can't beat that. It's the best shot I ever made. And nothing but net. Terry: (Impressed) Dang, man. You really shot the ball like a pro. (High five to Aaron) Aaron: That was Stephen Curry's style jumpshot. Shelby: Real nice shot, Aaron. Aaron: Thanks, Shelby. Shawn: Lucky shot, Aaron. A.J.: (To Shawn) You can't do this. Don't be nervous. Do not be nervous. I know you can do this. Derrick: Aaron, you feel that the NBA has to face reality, don't ya? It's just gotta start looking for some more dominant players in places they've never looked before. A.J.: (Continuing) Just look at the ball. Visualize the shot where you want it to go. Shawn: (Dribbles the ball) Right, right, right. A.J.: Be the ball. Be the ball. Shawn: (Annoyed) A.J., would you back up off of me. I'm trying to concentrate. A.J.: All right. Sorry about that, bro. Aaron: Did Shawn just tell you and Shelby that don't have the experience to be in the NBA and WNBA? Derrick: Yeah. Terry: The NBA aren't looking for players come from high school to draft no more. They looking for players who come from college. You gotta play college ball first if you want to play in the NBA. (To Shelby) And you too, Shelby, in the WNBA. Aaron: Hey, Shawn. How's double quarter pounder with cheese sounds? Shawn: Sounds good. Terry: Don't worry, Shawn. I'll pay for it and it's on me. Shawn: Naw. It's cool and I'll pay for my own meal. Shelby: I can go for McFlurry right now. Derrick: Me too. After the meal for lunch. A.J.: (Chuckling) Oh, stop that. You making me hungry, you guys. Shawn: Check this out. I can shoot from three point long range and it will be nothing but a net. Shawn looks at the ball, bend his knees, jumps, snaps his wrist, spread his fingerd and shoot it in the air. Shelby: Airball! Shawn: Come on! (Looks on as the ball to the basket rim) Look at that. It's going the rim. Before the ball when into the hoop, in the air, the ghost of Michael Jordan is in the sky, blowing to lure the basketball into the rim. Shawn, his siblings and his friends see the ball moving around. Shawn: (Whispering) Come on. Terry: Can the ball make it? Aaron: It is alive! Derrick and Shelby: O..M..G. The ball lands inside hoops and it was nothing but net. Shawn yelled in excitement, A.J., Shelby, Derrick, Terry and Aaron cheer for him. Shawn: Yeah! I made it! Oh, yeah! (GIves everybody high fives) They all chuckle as they go get the basketball and they gather around for a picture. A.J.: Oh. Cool. Shelby: Don't even say this. Aaron: I've never seen one of these before. Shawn: Guys, nothing but net. Derrick: That was cool. Shawn: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard that. (Chuckling) A.J.: Wait, wait, wait. Let me get a picture of this. All of you bring it in. Shawn: Guys, don't be jealous. A.J.: All right, guys. Here we go. Now you're all gonna smile. You ready for a picture? All: We ready. A.J.: And you think, \"This is good.\" Shawn: Just take the picture please! A.J.: All right. One. Two. Three. Say cheese. All: Cheese. (The picture snaps) They see the wind is blowing the trees in the wood and heard the noise too. A.J.: What is that noise? Derrick: I don't know. Sounds like a hurricane or something. They see something glowing in the woods as well. Shelby: And the woods is glowing too. Terry: It's probably the aliens come out of the sky. Aaron: This reminds of the show of The X-Files. Shawn: I think I'll go check out. You guys wait here. A.J.: Go ahead. Be careful out there. Shawn: A'ight. Shawn is running to the woods and he saw Michael Jordan as a ghost. Michael Jordan: Hey. Shawn: Mike? It's that you? Michael Jordan: Yeah. It's me. (Concerned) What's wrong, Shawn? You never seen a ghost? Shawn: No. What are you doing here in the woods, Mike? Michael Jordan: I've come here for you to help the Looney Tunes. I need your help to save the Looney Tunes at the basketball game against the aliens. Shawn: Wait a minute. What's gotta do with me? Michael Jordan: Bugs Bunny says that he choose you and as a right now, you have been chosen, Shawn Matthews. Come and please take my hand. Shawn: Okay. He touches Michael Jordan's hand and Shawn disappears with a white light flash. His siblings and his friends get confused that glowing stops and Shawn is missing. Terry: (concerned) Where's Shawn? A.J.: I don't know, man. He won't come out of the woods. Shelby: I think we better check it out and search for him. Aaron: Great Idea. They going to the woods and search for him. The camera cuts in a tunnel, Shawn is being dragged further down into the tunnel. He sees the Warner Bros. Pictures logo ahead, he went through it. He is in Looney Tune Land. He flies down from the sky and into their town. He crashes down onto the ground. Shawn sits up all dizzy, with flying basketball balls around his head. He sees Bugs Bunny in front of him. Bugs Bunny: Oh, uh, look out for the first step doc, it's a real lulu. Shawn: Bugs Bunny? Bugs Bunny: Eh, you were expecting maybe the Easter Bunny? Shawn: You're a cartoon character. You ain't even real. Bugs Bunny: Not real, eh? If I weren't real could I do this? Bugs grabs Shawn by the shirt and kissed him on the lips. Shawn wipes his mouth disgusted. Then the tunes show up. Elmer Fudd: Oh, \"wook\" is that Shawn? Sylvester: (Comes out from a manhole cover) It's Shawn! Witch Lezah: Hey, Gossamer, look! It's Shawn Matthews! Gossamer: Hey! Shawn \"The Human Lightning Bolt\" Matthews! Granny: It's Mr. Lightning Bolt! Tasmanian Devil: (Bursts from the mailbox) Basketball! Road Runner: My, my! Mr. Lightning Bolt himself! Tweety Bird: (Sees Shawn down below) Ooh. I tawt I taw... I did! I did tee Shawn Matthews! (Flies down from his nest) All of the tunes gather around Shawn as he looks at them. Yosemite Sam: (Tips his hat) Howdy, Mr. Matthews? Porky Pig: Pulling out a pencil and autograph book Eh, pardon me, Mr Matthews. Eh, could I have your auto...your John Hancock please? Wile E. Coyote: Excuse me, Mr. Matthews. Please allow me to introduce myself, young lad. My name is Wile E. Coyote. It is very pleasant to meet you. Daffy Duck: (Shows up wearing a doctor's uniform) Back off! Let the doctor take a look. He pulls the lever and Shawn is lifted in the air as he sits on the chair. He looks down and sees the toons. Daffy Duck: Whoops. A little high. Shawn: (Nervous shaking his head) Oh, no. Daffy Duck: Going down. (Pulls the lever) Shawn: (Closing his eyes and Yelling) No! He lands to the ground unharmed. The tunes claps and hold up number signs giving him points. Daffy Duck: So, what do you say we go for a little spin? (He spins Shawn around then stops the chair and looks in his ear with an otoscope) Hmm. Now let's what we got inside here. Bugs Bunny: (Waving) Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! Daffy Duck: (Puts a thermometer in Shawn's mouth) Say \"Ahh!\" (The thermometer swells and it explodes then Daffy stamped an \"A-OK\" sign on Shawn's forehead) All right. He's Okay! Shawn: Let me get this straight. First I touched Michael Jordan's hand, I was falling down to the cartoon world, those cartoon characters just came at me and that duck was playing doctor and stuff. Can somebody tell me that what's going on here? Because I'm totally confused. Bugs Bunny: (Jumps on Shawn's lap) Why Shawn, I thought you'd never ask. You see these aliens come from outer space, and they wanna make us slaves in their theme park. Eh, what do we care they're little. So we challenge them to a basketball game. But then they show up and they ain't so little. They're huge! We need to beat these guys. (Imaging himself being chained up and being forced to perform on stage) Cause they're talking about slavery! Then they'll make us do stand-up comedy, the same jokes every night for all eternity. We're gonna be locked up like wild animals and then trotted out to perform for a bunch of lowbrow, bug-eyed, fat-headed, humor- challenged aliens! Eh, what I'm trying to say is... (Shouting) We need your help! Shawn: Look here, Bugs. I hate to break it down to you. As much as I'm a NBA basketball player. But, I'm not playing in the NBA yet and I'm still a free agent. So sorry, I can't really help you, guys. Bugs Bunny: (Sarcastically, pulls out a rabbit skull) Right, doc, and I'm a Shakespearean actor. (Tosses the skull away) Meanwhile, back in the real world, Terry and Aaron is searching in the woods where Shawn went through. Aaron: (Yelling) Shawn? Shawn, where are you?! Terry: (Yelling) Shawn? Shawn, you better come out there. I'm ain't playin' high and seek games right now! Aaron: (Yelling) Look here, Shawn. We gotta streetball final tournament game tomorrow evening! Terry: (Yelling) We'd look pretty stupid if you don't show up by tomorrow evening! Derrick, Shelby and A.J. leave the park. Derrick: You think Shawn's all right? Boy, I hate to leave him like this. Shelby: I hope so. Where's Aaron and Terry? A.J.: They still in the woods. But don't worry. They'll catch up with us later. But right now, let go to McDonald's. Because I'm starving. Shelby: So am I. Derrick: Me too. Hey, A.J. A.J.: What's up? Derrick: Now, if Shawn is gone, the NBA is gonna need some new people. There's room at the top. An exciting kinda guy who could maybe even perform at halftime. Now, are you still tight with Adam Silver? I mean a phone call from you… AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now.

Pound: (Pointing at Shawn) Hey! Come here, kid! Pound grabs Shawn, then he scrunches him into a basketball while chucking meanly. Pound: (To Nawt) Here ya go, Nawt, Take him! (Tosses Shawn to Nawt) Nawt: (Catching Shawn and dribbling him faster) Watch the footwork! Can you believe it? Nawt shoots Shawn and he goes above the Toons burning their heads. Bang: (Catching Shawn) Get out of the way! (Slam dunks Shawn and the glass broke from the hoop) Shawn goes down he dribbled and moaned in pain as the Toons look at him with worry. Pound: (Mockingly to the Tunes) Hey, everybody, look at your hero now! (Snickering with his pals) Shawn unrolled back to his normal shape, the tunes approach Shawn looking at him with pity and the Monstars snicker at him looking at him meanly. Shawn: (Dusting himself) Listen, you guys are making a big mistake. What do you want for me? Bang: (Pointing at Shawn) You're all washed up, cornrow kid! Shawn: (Offended) Cornrow kid? I know you ain't talking to me like that. I'll knock the bricks outta you, fools. The tunes shocked about his trash talking words that Shawn used. Wile E. Coyote: (Offensive Shocked) Did you kiss your mother with that mouth, Young Shawn? Witch Lezah: (Hits Wile E. in his head) Hush up, Coyote! Tweety Bird: (Angrily flying up to Bang's face) He is not washed up, Shawn's is one the greatest ever! Bang: (Annoyed) Shaddup! (Flicked Tweety like a bug) Tweety hits the wall, he slides down and moans in pain Shawn picks him up in his hand. Tweety: My poor wittle cwanuim. Shawn: (Concerned) You alright, Tweety? Blanko: (Concerned pushing Bang and Bupkus aside) Yeah, you alright, little dude? (Leaning in to camera) Bang and Bupkus: (Pulling Blanko Angrily) Hey! (Glaring at him for being friendly) Blanko: Whoops. Sorry 'bout that. Tweety: (Teary eyed) You're not scared of them are you, Shawn? Shawn looks at Tweety and thinks for a moment. The Monstars look at Shawn smiling and chuckling evilly. The Tunes get nervous waiting for Shawn's answer, Shawn stands up and he looks at them he made up his mind. Shawn: Let's play some basketball. Looney Tunes: (Cheering) Yeah! Shawn: And Bugs, can I talk to you outside? Bugs: Okay, doc. Shawn is taking to Bugs outside, so Shawn can talk to Bugs in private. Bugs: Eh, Okay, Shawn, Now what's on your mind? Shawn: I need to explain something about this cartoon world, basketball, the Monstars and whatnot. Why do you bring me here and what's gotta do with me bring me here to help you? Bugs: Why, Shawn. I'll explain something to you. I had a phone with my friend Michael Jordan. Since Michael had been retired as a basketball player, So I used the ghost of Michael Jordan and I chose you to help us win the basketball game against the Monstars. Shawn: (Understands) I see what you mean. Well no offense, Bugs, If you want to help me, you should've ask and call me for future reference. The ghost of Michael Jordan appears. Michael Jordan: Hey, Shawn. Have you watched this movie before? Shawn: Yeah. I saw the movie when I was 6 years old and I used to have a VHS tape. Now I have a DVD. Michael Jordan: Since the Tunes and I defeated the first Monstars in the Ultimate Game. First, they was stole five NBA Players' talents. Such as Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson and Shawn Bradley. After we won the game, The Monstars gave the talent and I gave those talent back to the NBA players where they're belong. Shawn: I remember that movie what you talking about. So this is an alternative timeline and I will do the same thing. Right? Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny: Right. Shawn: (Snaps his finger) Ah, I remember this one. Five little aliens came from the Moron Mountain and that evil businessman Mr. Swackhammer needs new attractions. (To Bugs) The Nerdlucks' mission is find you and the Looney Tunes, Bugs.

Michael Jordan: No problem, Shawn. I always be watching you no matter what. If you need me, just call me. (Handshake to Michael) Shawn: Bugs, Can I have a carrot? Bugs: Sure. Why not?

But not characters from the movie that I owned. Back in the real world, teenage boys and girls are playing basketball and Brandon Ingram walks by. He sees the boys and girls, he stops and watched them play. A girl gets the ball and looks up at Brandon Ingram, she couldn't believe her eyes. Teenage girl: (Surprised) You're...you're Brandon Ingram. (Brandon nods) Teenage boy: Who you talking to? Teenage girl: (Calling to her friends) Guys, come on over. Hurry up, hurry. Look it's Brandon Ingram. Brandon Ingram: Sup, kids. Can I play with y'all? Teenagers: (Agreeing) Sure! Brandon smiled and goes in, the girl passes the ball to him and he dribbles it. The boy shoots it and boy passes to Brandon he prepares to shoot it but the boy knocks the ball out of his hands. Teenage boy: You ain't Brandon Ingram. Just a wannabe who looks like him. Sorry, break out. You shouldn't even be here. Be gone. Wannabe, be gone! Brandon leaves then the camera switches to the hospital where the five NBA players are walking with the doctor. Doctor: Just a few more tests, gentlemen. Tests for electrolyte levels, glucose, CBCS, RBCS, ET cetera. and we've scheduled a 12-lead stress, and neurological battery to include EEG, the reflex test… As the doctor continues talking, Giannis, Joel, Kristaps, Brandon and Karl hit their heads on the doorway and fell backwards. In the therapist's office Brandon talks to the psychiatrist. Brandon Ingram: And then this boy 5 foot 9, blocked my shot. Psychiatrist: When did you first start having this dream, Brandon? Brandon Ingram: Doc, I don't think it's a dream, it really happened. The five NBA players kept going through tests and talked to the doctors. Giannis Antetokounmpo: (Stands up) And it climbed up my back and into my brain. Back at the Psychiatrist's office, it's Karl's turn. Psychiatrist: Are there any other areas, besides basketball...where you find yourself...unable to perform? Karl-Anthony Towns: (Sits up, pauses before saying something) Umm, Yeah, I guess. Psychiatrist: Okay. What would you do, Karl? Back at the hospital, they continued doing tests and the five NBA players are in wheelchairs. Joel Embiid: I've been MRI'D, EKG'D, X-rayed, laser beamed… At the Psychiatrist's office, it's Joel turn to talk to the Psychiatrist. Joel Embiid: If I get another injury, then I'll retire for the professional career. Psychiatrist: Well, what can you do, Joel? Joel Embiid: I'm thinking about coaching high school basketball at my hometown or maybe at University of Kansas that I played from. To be an assistant coach until I get promoted to head coach. (Then it's Kristaps' turn) Kristaps Porzingis: I've got other skills. I could play soccer from my home country. Psychiatrist: Really? Do you have any other skills besides athletic career, Kristaps? (Then it's Giannis' turn) Giannis Antetokounmpo: What are you saying, that I'm trying to disobey my parents? Psychiatrist: I didn't say that, you did, Giannis. Giannis Antetokounmpo: But I love my parents. Brandon Ingram: Still can't find anything wrong with us. Giannis Antetokounmpo: Hey, maybe there's nothing wrong with us. Karl-Anthony Towns: That's right, Giannis. Maybe it's just in our heads. Kristaps Porzingis: We're fine. It's just some psychosomatic deal or something to do with the moon or the alignment of the planet. Joel Embiid: I hope so. we all had an off day. It's all in our minds. No need to worry. All we gotta do is pray. Giannis Antetokounmpo: That's a spirit, Joel. Back at the woods at the park after lunch, A.J., Derrick, Shelby, Terry and Aaron is still searching for Shawn where he went to. A.J.: Yo, guys! Have you seen Shawn around here? Aaron, Shelby, Terry and Derrick: No. Aaron: (Frustrated) Man. Shawn still not here, man. I don't know where he is. Terry: Chill out, Aaron. He still in the woods somewhere. Shelby: I gotta get home at 3:00. Derrick: Me too, Shelby. Besides, Kayla is going to be worried sick and Kimberly and My mama and daddy. A.J.: Don't worry, guys. We're going to find Shawn one more time. If not, we'll search for him tomorrow. Shelby and Derrick: A'ight. A.J., Derrick, Shelby, Terry and Aaron continues searching for Shawn high and low. Back in Looney Tune Land, and in the gym the tunes are practicing but they're messing and fooling around as Shawn watches. Sam shoots the ball in the air and it flies, then it hits Daffy in the butt and he falls to the ground. Wile E. picks up the ball then Road Runner comes and takes it from him. Road Runner crashes through the wall, Wile E. sees this and goes after him, he hits the hole and slides up like a blind. Shawn shakes his head. Shawn: Has anyone ever played basketball before besides Bugs and myself? Then a girl bunny, a girl duck and a girl pig comes in. The three girls names are Lola Bunny, Tina Russo and Petunia Pig and the tunes turn around and see the girls. Lola Bunny: Um, I have. Tina Russo: What's up, guys? Petunia Pig: Lola, Tina and I'd like to try out for the team. Bugs Bunny: Hey? Daffy Duck: Ahooga! Porky Pig: (Stammering) Oh, my gosh. Tina Russo: (Comes to Daffy) Hey, stud. My name is Tina Russo.

Bugs Bunny: Hello. Eh, my name is...(Belches) Bugs! (Lola giggles and he clears his throat) Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig: Hey, Ladies, Do you wanna play a little three on three, dolls? Lola Bunny, Tina Russo and Petunia Pig: (Offended with fire in their eyes) Dolls!? Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig: (Hearts in their eyes) Uh-huh. Lola Bunny: On the court...,boys. Bugs Bunny: Sure. Tweety Bird: Ooh, those girls are hot. (Touches his rear and steam appear with a hissing sound) Shawn smiled at him and the tunes watch as Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Lola, Tina and Petunia play together. Lola Bunny: Ready? (Dribbling the ball) Bugs Bunny: Yes. (Trying to block her) I got it! I got it! Lola passes the ball to Tina, Daffy tries to block her, Tina passes the ball to Petunia and Porky tries to block her as well. After that, Petunia passes the ball back to Lola and Bugs still trying to block her. Before he could get the ball, Lola spins him around and winds him up in a knot. She dribbles the ball, passes to Petunia, Petunia passes to Tina, Tina tosses the ball to Lola and slam dunks it as an alley-oop. The Tunes are impressed with her skills. Shawn: (Impressed) These girls got some skills. (Tweety nods in agreement) Gossamer: You can say that again, Mr. Matthews. Speedy Gonzales: Those chicas are cool, amigo. Tina Russo: Oh, boys. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig: (Sees Lola, Tina and Petunia walking up to them) Yes? Lola Bunny: (Pulls them to them faces) Don't ever call us...doll. (Blows the ears out of her face) Tina kisses Daffy in the cheek and Petunia kisses Porky in the cheeks as well. Bugs Bunny: Check. Daffy Duck: Aye-Aye, Miss Tina. (Takes a bow) Porky Pig: No problem, Petunia. (Smiles) Lola Bunny: (Heading for the door) Hey, nice playing with ya. (To Tina and Petunia) Come on, girls (The tunes smile at the girls as they leaves) Shawn: Very smooth. Bugs Bunny: (Shrugging) Ahh, she's obviously nuts about me. Porky Pig: (Stammering) S-S-So am I. Daffy Duck: Me too. Shawn: Obviously. Pepe Le Pew: (Holding the ball) Mais oui. Shawn: Alright then, where's the ball? (Pepe passes the ball to him) Let's do some drills. The tunes murmur in agreement. As, Shawn has no shoes, he trips and then he falls to the ground. Shawn: Can someone lend me a pair of sneakers? Bugs Bunny: Uh, sneakers? They all look down on their feet and they're all bare footed (except Elmer, Gossamer and Sam). Tweety Bird: (Wiggling his foot) Sowwy. Shawn: Looks like someone's gonna have to go my house and pick up my basketball gear. Daffy Duck: To your house? (Spitting) In 3-D land? Shawn: Yeah, whatever you do don't forget my Kentucky shorts. Daffy Duck: Your shorts from college? Shawn: I wore them under my Memphis Grizzlies uniform every game. Looney Tunes: (Disgusted) Eww! Shawn: Hey, guys. I washed them after every game. Daffy Duck: (Scoffs) Yeah! Sylvester: Sure! Gossamer: No way! Wile E. Coyote: Not me! Road Runner: Me neither! Shawn: I did! Porky Pig: Gross! AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now.

Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. Shawn Matthews, his friends and his family are the OC Characters (I used five active NBA current players). But not characters from the movie that I owned. Back in the real world, it is nighttime Daffy and Bugs are under the grass. Daffy Duck: The view back here stinks! Bugs Bunny: (Stops and sees the house) Whoa! (Bumps into Daffy) Daffy Duck: Ow! What? Bugs Bunny: We're right in front of Shawn's house. Daffy Duck: I knew that. Bugs Bunny: Shhh! Okay let's go in this way. Daffy Duck: I'd say let's go in that way! They go in different directions. Bugs goes into the house and Daffy goes into the backyard. Bugs Bunny: He just never learns. Bugs went in the house, and Daffy went to the backyard. Daffy Duck: Now let me see, I must be very, very close. (Lights up a lighter and sees Keith who is growling at him) (Nervously) Mother. Outside the doghouse, it shakes and Daffy screams as Keith attacks him. Inside the house, Bugs comes out from the under the rug humming. Bugs Bunny: Nice digs. (As he fixes the rug, he hears knocking on the door) Well, well. I wonder who that could be. Bugs opens the door and Daffy comes in. Daffy Duck: (Dizzy) Twinkle, twinkle, little star..(Falls down) Bugs Bunny: Shhh! Quiet, Daffy. (Whispering) Everyone's sleeping. Daffy Duck: (Gets up) I knew that. Bugs Bunny: (Closes the front door) Come on, come on. We gotta find Shawn's basketball stuff. They walk down the hall to look for the basketball gear. Bugs Bunny: (Opens the right door and peaks) Nope. Nothing in here. (Closes the door) Daffy Duck: (Opens the left door and peaks) Nope. Ahh, but a very nice dinette set. (Closes the door) Bugs Bunny: (Peeks through another door) Uh-uh. Not here. (Closes the door) Let's look upstairs. Daffy Duck: Yes. O' fearless leader. They both go upstairs, they open the first door slowly, it is Shelby's bedroom. Daffy Duck: So he needs his special underwear...(Sees Shelby sleeping) Bugs Bunny: Shhh! Would you be quiet. Daffy Duck: (Quietly) Sorry. You think she's got enough toys? Bugs Bunny: Speaking of toys, you know all these mugs and T-shirts and lunchboxes with our pictures on 'em? Daffy Duck: Yeah. As they talk, Shelby wakes up and sees shadows of Bugs and Daffy. Bugs and Daffy leave the room. Bugs Bunny: You, uh ever see any money from all that stuff? Daffy Duck: (Scoffs) Not a cent. Bugs Bunny: Hmm, me neither. Shelby gets out of her bed, wanting to see them. Daffy Duck: (Sighs) It's a crying shame. We gotta get new agents. We're getting screwed. They go inside the room at the end of the hall and closed the door. Shelby sees the door closed and smiled. Bugs Bunny: We have found the trophy room. Now spread out and search the place. Daffy Duck: (Bows) Yes, sahib. Oh, brother. (Turns on the lamp, muttering to himself) I am in the peak of the form, playing second banana to some sort of harebrain… Bugs Bunny: Yap, yap, yap. (Sees the Kentucky bag) Hmm. This could be useful. Aha! (Grabs the bag) Daffy Duck: (Digging out the drawers from the dresser) If this were a union job, I'd... Yes, that's very nice. Bugs Bunny: Hmm. (Sees the sneaker) Oh, one of his shoes. (Puts the sneaker in the bag and looks around) Where is that other shoe? (Sing-songy) Where are you? (Sees the sneaker on the stand) Eureka! (Gets the chair and climbs on it) Come to papa. As Bugs climbs up, Shelby peaks in and sees them. Bugs Bunny: (Nearly slips and the trophy falls) Oops! Daffy Duck: (Annoyed) What a fuzz foot. You are so clumsy! Bugs Bunny: (Reaches the shoe and pushed it off) Catch, feather head. Daffy Duck: (Catches it with the bag) Thanks. Shelby: (Whispering) I gotta tell Derrick and A.J. Then Shelby leaves to tell her brothers, as she walks away, Shelby goes to Derrick's door. Shelby: (Knocking Derrick's door) Derrick? Derrick. Open up. It's me Shelby. Derrick wakes up and come to the door. Derrick: A'ight. (Opens the door) What? Shelby: Derrick, I saw Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Derrick: Who? Shelby: Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. They're in the trophy room taking Shawn's stuff. Derrick: Don't play with me, Shelby, you having a dream and it's in your imagination and Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck aren't in the real world. Shelby: No. I'm ain't playin'. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck is in the house and it's for real. I need you to come with me and we get A.J. Derrick: (Annoyed) Alright. Alright. I'll go with you. Shelby: But you gotta be quiet. Derrick and Shelby walks in the hallway and they about to go to A.J.'s door. But A.J. comes out of the bathroom. A.J.: Hey. What you guys doing here? Shelby: I saw Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in the trophy room and they taking Shawn's stuff. You gotta come with me. A.J.: What was all about? Is it a joke? Derrick: We can explain later. Now come with me. Shelby: You gotta believe me. Daffy and Bugs are about to leave. Bugs Bunny: Well, time to go. Daffy Duck: Did we get everything? Daffy and Bugs: (Realizing) The shorts! Bugs Bunny: (Sees the door) In there? Daffy Duck: (Walks to the door) Okay, I'll check. (Opens the door, and sees Keith growling at him who has the shorts in his mouth, then Daffy closes the door and gets scared) I found the shorts. (Then Keith breaks down the door and makes it fall on Daffy) (Dizzy coming out from the door) The pain. (Then he runs up to Bugs) I'm right behind you, pal. Bugs Bunny: Uh, that's none too reassuring. Daffy Duck: Nice puppy. (Pulls out a bone) How's about a bone? (Keith doesn't take it) No dice. As Keith corners Bugs and Daffy menacingly, Shelby, Derrick, and A.J. peeks through the door, and they see what's going on. Bugs Bunny: (Pulls out a ham) What about a nice holiday ham? (Keith doesn't take it either) He ain't buying it. Can't we talk this over rover. Daffy Duck: (Hugging Bugs, scared) Down, Beethoven. Bugs Bunny: (Sees Shawn's siblings) Ooh! His siblings are here. The siblings come in the room, and Derrick grabs the shorts. Derrick: Give it to me, Keith! Keith is snarling and wouldn't let go of the shorts, he pulls it out of Keith mouth and he gives the shorts to Bugs. Derrick: Here you go, Bugs. Bugs Bunny: (Chuckling) Thanks, kid. (Gives him a thumbs up) A.J.: (To Keith) Shoo! Shoo! Get outta here, Keith. Keith whimpers and leaves the room. Daffy Duck: Bad dog! That is the last time I'm ever working with dogs or children...and teenagers! Bugs Bunny: (Walking away) Bye-bye. A.J.: (Stops them) Hey, Bugs, where you going? Bugs Bunny: Well, uh, you see, the Looney Tunes have a big basketball game coming up, and uh, your brother's gonna play. Shelby: Cool! By the way, guys. Can we come and Shawn's friends too? Bugs Bunny: Eh, I don't know, but let me think. (Thinking) Yeah, you guys can come and help your brother and bring his friends too. A.J.: Yeah. Derrick: I'm with you. Bugs Bunny: Meet me at the park in the woods in 15 minutes and please don't tell anybody. (Leaves the house) A.J.: (Nods his head) (To Shelby and Derrick) Alright, guys. Let's get dressed, pack your gear and clothes but one outfit. Let's get Terry and Aaron. But try not to tell Mama, Daddy, Kimberly and not even Kayla. I think I know where Shawn at. Derrick and Shelby: Okay. Meanwhile the five NBA players are at a fortune teller's place, they sit next to her, holding hands around. She is humming while looking at her crystal ball. Fortune Teller: I see aliens. Little aliens from outer space. They force their way inside your bodies. They need your talent to win a basketball game against Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes. Karl-Anthony Towns: (Whispering) Bugs Bunny? Giannis Antetokounmpo: (Whispering) And the Looney Tunes? Fortune Teller: I also see Shawn Matthews, he was touched by the ghost of Michael Jordan, he was disappointed at the woods and heads down to the Looney Tune Land. Joel Embiid: (Gets up from the chair) That's it. We're outta here. Karl-Anthony Towns: I can't take it no more. Let's bail, guys. Giannis Antetokounmpo: We're leaving now. Kristaps Porzingis: Let's try some acupuncture. Brandon Ingram: Good idea, Kris. (To Fortune teller) See ya. Back at the woods in the park, A.J., Shelby, Derrick, Aaron and Terry has their flashlight and find the spot where Shawn located to. A.J.: Guys, I think I know where Shawn is. Bugs and Daffy got Shawn's stuff and all we gotta do is follow them. Aaron: Are you sure? Because he's got a basketball game tomorrow for the finals. Terry and I am too. Terry: If Shawn ain't there and we forfeit the game. I can't let that happen. Bugs and Daffy are walking by, but they don't see them. Daffy Duck: You better hope this Matthews character still knows how to play hoops. Bugs Bunny: You and me both, brother. As they talk, they hears them and noticed them. They spies on them as they walk by. Daffy Duck: Listen, how's this for a new team name? The Ducks! Bugs Bunny: Please. What kind of Mickey Mouse organization would name their team, the ducks? Daffy Duck: So sue me, It's just a suggestion. Bugs looks at them and wave at them. Bugs Bunny: Pshh! Hey, docs. I'm right here. They saw them and they come to them. Daffy Duck: (Whispering) Hey, guys. Perfect timing. Now Bugs and I want you to follow us because you'll about to see your brother and (To Aaron and Terry) your friend. Bugs and Daffy both dive in the hole and then they follow them as well. Meanwhile in Looney Tune Land and in the gym, the tunes are working out while watching a Richard Simmons workout video. Richard Simmons on TV: You're doing it! You're becoming mighty! Go! Porky Pig: Come on, guys. No pain, no gain. Petunia Pig: Work the body. Richard Simmons on TV: I don't hear it! What is it? Foghorn Leghorn: Come on, guys. Gossamer: We gotta stay in shape before the game. Tina Russo: Hang tough, guys. Road Runner: Keep it up. Wile E. Coyote: Keep on sweating on your willpower. Richard Simmons on TV: Now shake it! Keep on sweating! As they work out, Bugs comes in. Bugs Bunny: Eh, guys? Looney Tunes: Yes? Bugs Bunny: Look who's finally ready to play. The tunes look on with awe as Shawn comes in wearing basketball clothes. Shawn: Let's see if I remember how to do this. Shawn starts practicing his moves and the tunes are impressed that Shawn is back in business and back before the NBA Season starts in fall. He keeps slam dunking the ball in the hoop. Then A.J., Derrick, Shelby, Aaron and Terry arrives clapping and smiling. A.J., Derrick, Shelby, Aaron and Terry: (Happily) Hey, Shawn! (Shawn stops and turns to see them) Shelby: Is it really you?! Oh! (Shelby running up to him, and hugged him happily) Aaron: Thank god, you're alright! (High-five and handshake to Shawn) A.J.: You're all right! Oh! I was so worried! (Handshake and hug to Shawn) Derrick: Thank god, you're alright! I was so worried about you! (Handshake and hug to Shawn) Terry: I haven't seen you yesterday and where you been, bruh? (High-five and handshake to Shawn) Shawn: (Happily) I missed you, guys. I'm alright. What you guys doing here? Terry: We gotta take you back. You got streetball practice before final tournament tonight. Shawn: I wish, but I can't. I'm helping my friends in their basketball game. And after that, they turns to see the tunes who are smiling and waving at them. A.J.: Uh, Shawn, do you know that your friends are cartoon characters? Shawn: Yeah, so? Shelby: Naw. Doesn't bother you, doesn't bother us. Let us help! Derrick: Shawn, Let us help! Aaron: We can help, man! Terry: Let us help, dude! Shawn: What can you guys do? A.J.: (Takes the ball and dribbles) Well, you know what I mean. I used to play basketball in high school, but I've torn my ACL and as a right now, I got a bad knee and I won't be able to play. (Pass the ball to Shelby) Wile E. Coyote: That was really sad. Sylvester: (Looks at Shelby and Derrick is playing basketball and doing some skills) Hey, look, guys. (Points at them) Those teenage kids playing basketball and they have skills too. Sufferin' Succotash. Elmer Fudd: (Looks at Terry and Aaron is playing basketball and doing the skills too) And 'awso\" those guys \"pwaying\" \"basketbaww\" too. (Chuckling) Yosemite Sam: I guess those guys aren't so bad after all. They got skills. While Terry blocking Derrick, Derrick passes the ball to Shelby and while Aaron is blocking Shelby, she shoots the ball to the hoops and she made the shot. Shelby: Two points! Road Runner: (Shocked) Wow! I've never seen those guys playing ball before. Gossamer: They good too. Shawn: Hey. Good job, guys. Keep playing and I'll be right there. A.J.: I'll do anything, Shawn! Anything! Shawn: Anything? A.J.: Anything. Shawn: (Escorts A.J. to the benches) Come here. Come here for a second. Sit right here. Tweety is sitting down by Granny and Witch Lezah on the benches. He's about to sit on Tweety and he moves out of the way. He blows a raspberry at A.J. Shawn: Since you can't play, How about I can use you as a coach of the team? A.J.: Coach? Ohh, Shawn. I'm not a coach. I'm the Sports Agent and I don't know much about coaching. Shawn: I'll tell you what, bro. After I'm finish shooting some hoops with them. Then Bugs and I'll teach you some coaching skills. Cool? A.J.: I can do that. (Clapping) All right! All right! Let's go, team! (Chuckling, to Granny and Witch Lezah) You know, if somebody gets injured, we could see a lot of minutes. Granny: (Holding out pompoms) I'm a cheerleader. Witch Lezah: (Holding out pompoms) Ooh, child, I can cheer our team along with my boy Gossamer. I'm sure my boy can play. (Chuckling) A.J. (Blows his whistle) Hey, guys. Bring it in. They gather around and listen what A.J. has something to say. A.J.: Guys, since we don't have a team name and we can't play basketball without a team name. Does anybody has a suggestion for the game? Bugs Bunny: How about the Tune Squad? Shawn: Yeah. I like it. We go by Tune Squad. Anybody agreeing with their team name. A.J.: All right. Tune Squad it is. Shawn: Okay, Tune Squad, Listen up. Tonight in the Ultimate Game, we're get ready to go out there and show the Monstars who's the boss. All we got to do is keep your heads up, give it your best, have some fun and play basketball against the Monstars. A.J. All right, Tune Squad. Hand, feathers and paw together. Because tonight, we're gonna kick some Monstars butt. (They gather hands) I want you hear Tune Squad loud and clear on three. One. Two. Three. Tune Squad: Tune Squad! (Breaks away) They cheering and now the team called themselves Tune Squad. Meanwhile, back in the real world and at The Warriors Practice Facility, Oakland, California, there are police cars, fire trucks, and owners around the building and the entire building is covering. Then a limo pulls up and a Commissioner of NBA comes out and the reporters gather around him. Foreman: Mr. Commissioner, we've got the place sealed off. Commissioner: (To reporters) Quiet! Ladies and gentlemen, please, quiet! Listen, after meeting with team owners, I have decided that until we guarantee the health and safety of our NBA players, there will be no more basketball this season until further notice. Then the Commissioner walks away, as the reporters are shouting for him and taking pictures. AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. Bugs and Daffy went to Shawn's family house to pick up his stuff that Shawn need. Unfortunately, A.J. knew where Shawn located. Along with A.J., Derrick, Shelby, Aaron and Terry followed Bugs and Daffy to the Looney Tune Land where located. Thank god, Shawn is okay and his friends and his siblings were happy to see them.

When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Giannis, Towns, Ingram, Porzingis and Embiid - so Bugs gets some help from NBA superstar Shawn Matthews. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. Shawn Matthews, his friends and his family are the OC Characters (I used five active NBA current players). But not characters from the movie that I owned. Back in Looney Tune Land a sign says \"Tonight the Ultimate Game.\" The cars are in heavy traffic, The spotlights are shining around. Inside the dome. The Tunes are getting ready for the big game. Lola Bunny: (Taping her hand) Yes! Bugs puts his shorts on and makes his tail come out from behind, Elmer ties a bandana to his head and growled. Taz is having trouble getting his jersey on, so he spins around and rips it up and only half a little of it remains. Gossamer looks at the mirror, gets angry and flexes his muscle. Tina and Petunia are doing stretching. Sylvester and Tweety are doing jump roping and Tweety jumps off and puts on black lace on his face. Daffy puts on a armor helmet and uses random things around him. Daffy Duck: Just get out of my way. Shawn puts on his jersey and it said Tune Squad then he looks at his team. Shawn: Ready? Looney Tunes: Yeah! Yes! Shawn: Let's go. In the arena of the court, the crowd is cheering and booing and Mr Swackhammer and his Nerdluck slaves have arrived to watch the game then he walks to his seat. Mr. Swackhammer: Are these the best seats? I like em Yes! I can see everything from here. Very good. At the announcement box the announcer is asleep, then Hubie and Bertie pull the cord of the speaker and decided to do the announcing. Bertie: Okey-doke ready to go? Hubie: (Pushing Bertie out of the way) Yeah, yeah, sure, riot! (Clears throat then Sportscaster-style voice) Ladies and gentlemen, the starting lineup for the Tune Squad. At shooting guard standing 3'4\", the most toughest lady duck of the hoops, Tina Russo! Tina appears with two balls in her hands, she dribbles it, hits them in the air, land on two fingers and spins it around with her two fingers as the crowd cheers. Hubie: At small forward standing, standing a scintillating 3'2\", heartthrob of the hoops, Lola Bunny! Charlie the dog from the crowd passes the ball to Lola she catches it and dribbles it then she spins it around with her finger. Hubie: At power forward the quackster of the court, Daffy Duck! Daffy Duck: (Running to the court) Thank you! Thank you! The crowd is silent, the crickets chirp and Daffy is not happy about it. Daffy Duck: (Disappointed but Sarcastically) Very funny. Let's all laugh at the duck except Tina. Hubie: And at one point guard, standing 3'3\"...4' if you include the ears, Co-Captain of the Tune Squad, the doctor of delight, Bugs Bunny! Bugs Bunny: (Pops out of the floor) Thank you! Thank you! The crowd cheered, and the Nerdluck slaves from Swackhammer's stand boo and jeered at Bugs. Hubie: And now the Player and Assistant Coach of the Tune Squad, at 6'8\", from the University of Kentucky, \"The Human Lightning Bolt\" Shawn Matthews! The crowed cheered as Shawn smiled and he runs in the court to his teammates, Swackhammer watched Shawn as he holds one of his slaves in his hand. Mr. Swackhammer: (Confused) Who? Is he a Looney Tune? Nerdluck Slave: (Stammers nervously) Uh, uh well perhaps. On the court, A.J. (Wearing in suits as a head coach) Shawn and the tunes form up together and they put their hands on top of each other. A.J.: You guys ready? Daffy Duck: I'm set to take the rack, Jack! Tweety Bird: Those Monstars will wish they never been born! Shawn: Guys, let's just go out, have fun and give it your best. Looney Tunes: Yeah! Hubie: The challengers for the ultimate game, all the way from Moron Mountain, the Monstars! The Monstars run on the court singing Hit em High as Shawn looks on, Bang and Bupkus did a body slam, Pound thumping his chest like a gorilla, Blanko and Nawt bump each other's chest. The Nerdluck slaves cheer for the Monstars. Nerdluck Slaves: Go Monstars! Go Monstars! Go, Monstars! Go, go! The Crowd boos at the Monstars, Shawn approaches them as the spotlights turn off. Bang growls at him and Shawn shakes his head and give them a bad attitude face. Bang: What are you looking at, boy? Pound growled at Tina, she gulped. Shawn gets into his position as Lola and Bugs run into their positions, Blanko approached Shawn as he gets into his position. Blanko: (Chuckling) Cool shoes. Shawn: Thanks. Marvin the Martian as a referee approached them with the ball, Blanko and Shawn both look at him. Marvin the Martian: Ready? Marvin throws the ball in the air, Blanko and Shawn jump up then Shawn gets it and hits it away from Blanko. The game is on Pound jumps up to catch the ball but missed it, Bugs catches the ball and dribbles it. Bugs Bunny: I got it! I got it! I got it! I got the ball! I got the ball! Bang: (Backhanding Bugs) Coming through little boys! (Bugs slides on the floor) Shawn: (Sees Bugs hurt) Ooh, that's gonna hurt. Bugs is seeing stars, Pound has the ball he jumped up to the hoop and slam dunked into the hoop, That's two points for the Monstars. Mr. Swackhammer: (Cheering to the Monstars) Way to go boys! (To Minions) Didn't you see the moves on that one? Marvin passes the ball to Tina and he passes the ball to Shawn. He runs for the hoop but Pound, Bang, Bupkus, and Nawt block his way as they start to taunt him. Bupkus: (Taunting) Come on, come on, show me something. Nawt: What'cha got? Shawn tries to shoot but Pound keeps blocking his way, so he passes the ball to Daffy. Daffy Duck: (Catches the ball) Whoops! Bupkus: (Pointing at Daffy) The duck! Pound: Yeah, beat up on the duck man! Daffy gets scared and looks around, the Monstars charge at him. Without thinking Daffy passes the ball to Granny and Witch who is sitting on the bench with Gossamer. Granny catches the ball and gets scared as the Monstars see her and charged at them, the Monstars jump on Granny and Witch, but Gossamer gets out of the way. Shawn see this and Granny and Witch got hurt. Granny: (Dizzy seeing birds) Oh, my. Witch Lezah: (Dizzy seeing birds) Ouch. Gossamer: (Angrily and yells) Hey! That's my mother, you freaks! Daffy Duck: (To Tina and Lola who is glaring at him smiling) She was wide open! Lola shook her head and walked away and Tina too. It's the Monstars ball, Pound passes the ball to Nawt, he dribbles it Lola tried to stop him, but Nawt spins past her and passes the ball to Bupkus. Then Bupkus slam dunks, earning two more points. Shawn has the ball and he runs through the court, dribbling through the court. Nawt: (Trying to block Shawn) Watch the screen. Coming your way. Coming your way. Watch out! Bang: Come on get him! Pound and Bang tried to stop Shawn but he jumps and slam dunks. He scores the first points for the Tune Squad. At Swackhammer's stand the Nerdluck slaves gave Mr. Swackhammer a massage and sees Shawn scored. Mr. Swackhammer: (Surprised) How did he do that? (Slam his fist down angrily) Back on the court, the Monstars has the ball. Gossamer runs up to Shawn. Gossamer: Hey. Nice shot, Mr. Matthews. Shawn: (Sees Nawt with ball) Hey, Hey, Hey come on. Get back on defense! Nawt passes the ball to Blanko and he slams it to the hoop earning two more point. Mr. Swackhammer: (Cheering) Way to go! Bugs Bunny: Hey, Shawn! Hey, Shawn! (Passing the ball to Shawn and he catches it, he looks up to see the Monstars staring down at him) Monstars: Red light! Tweety Bird: Feed me! Feed me! Sylvester: (Grabbing Tweety) Feed you? Feed me! (Puts Tweety in his mouth, Shawn passes the ball to Sylvester, hitting his stomach which made him spit out Tweety) Tweety Bird: (Lands on the ground) Bad ol' putty tat! Pound: (Picking up the ball) I'll take that, thank you. (Runs up to the hoop) Don't try this at home! (Jumps up and slam dunks it) Foghorn Leghorn: (Singing while dribbling the ball) I wish I was in the land of cotton. Bang: (Blocking Foghorn's way) You going somewhere, chicken boy? Foghorn Leghorn: May I remind you, sir, that physical violence is paitiently against- Before he could finish, Bang leaned back then breathed fire like a dragon and burns Foghorn to crisp. Foghorn Leghorn: (Quoting the old KFC saying) Did you order original recipe or extra crispy? Dissolves into ashes as Bang looks on smiling meanly. The buzzer goes off and it goes to the second period. Shawn goes to the bench to pick out another player. He looks around and picks one. Shawn: Guys. We're getting creamed. Let's go. Sniffles: (Happily) Me? (Running to the court) Oh, boy! I'm ready! I can can do this! Terry: (Confused) A Mouse? Aaron: A.J., you picked the Mouse? The tunes laugh at this. Sniffles went to Blanko, he looks at Sniffles while holding the ball in his hands. Sniffles stops to talk to Blanko. Sniffles: I love basketball. I've always love basketball. Do you love basketball? Blanko: Uh-huh. Sniffles: (Continuing) You're big but you're pretty good at basketball. I'm small, but I'll try really hard at playing basketball. Really I will. Blanko: (Listening to Sniffles) Right. Okay. Yeah. Sniffles: and my mom always says. \"Try your best in everything you- Before Sniffles could finish Blanko drops the ball on him which causes the crowd to gasp in shock. Shelby: That's gonna hurt. Derrick: That ain't cool that blue dude hits a Mouse. Lola has the ball and dribbles it, Tina and Petunia runs with her, she passes the ball to Petunia and she bounce passes the ball to Tina and she dribbles it to the hoop, but Pound and Bang get in her way. Pound: (Jeering) Try to get by me dolls! Lola Bunny, Tina Russo and Petunia Pig: Dolls!? As Tina tosses the ball to Lola, Lola jumps up and dribbles Pound's face with her feet, Pound reacts in surprise upon seeing her catches and slam dunk along with Bang. She scored and the tunes cheered for her. Lola Bunny: Don't ever call us…(Blows the ears out of her face) dolls. (Pound looks at her dumbfounded) Bugs Bunny: (High-fives Lola) Nice shot! Lola Bunny: Thanks Bugs. Daffy Duck: (High fives Tina) Great assist, Tina! Tina Russo: Thanks, Daffy! Bupkus: (Confused seeing Shawn block him) Hmm? Pound: (To Shawn) Where's your defense boy? (Grabs and spins Shawn around) I gotcha right here! Bupkus: (Jumping up to the hoop) 911! (Slam dunks and earned two more points) At Swackhammer's stand his Nerdluck slaves serve him food and Swackhammer doesn't notice he smiled and chuckled evilly as he watched the Monstars score. Nerdluck slave: (Serving Swackhammer food) Steak? Piece of pie? Pork chop? some sorbet perhaps? Bang: (Slam dunking the ball) In your face! Nawt: (Slam dunking the ball, while sticking his tongue out) Goin' Airborne! (Chuckling) Blanko: Three points, here we go, dudes and dudettes! (He made a three point shot) The crowd boos as the Monstars continue to score and on the scoreboard on the Monstars side is going up like a casino machine and it says \"Kinda one-sided isn't it?\" then Pound jumps up letting out a yell and makes one more slam dunk before the time runs out. Marvin the Martian: (Shooting his laser gun) Halftime. (He turns to see Sylvester coughing and he sees there's a hole in his chest) Tweety Bird: (Flying through a hole) Holy putty tat! (Sylvester felt annoyed) The tunes felt sad, they think they're gonna lose. The Monstars celebrate their first half victory as they high-five each other. Bupkus: Yeah, man. We got it going. One more half. Pound: Right, man. We got 'em. Sylvester: (Sadly) Moron Mountain, here we come. Elmer Fudd: \"We'we\" gonna be \"swaves\". Road Runner: I don't think I'm going to like Moron Mountain. Wile E. Coyote: Neither am I, Road Runner. Gossamer: I don't wanna go to Moron Mountain to be slaves like Mr. Fudd says. Shawn: Come on guys, keep your heads up, we got another half to play.

Bang and Bupkus high five each other as they laugh, Bang pulls Pound into a noogie but their celebration was cut short they felt shocked upon seeing their boss. Bupkus: Hey look, guys. It's the boss! (Mr. Swackhammer lights his cigar) Monstars: Hello, Mr. Swackhammer. Mr. Swackhammer: Alright, fellas, not bad for the first half, but we got to keep this up. Pound: (Gleefully, shrugging) Hey, no problem, boss. We stole the- Before he could finish Nawt interrupted. Nawt: (Talking fast to Swackhammer) We stole the talent, boss, from one of the best players of the NBA. (Grabbing Swackhammer's lapels) Shelby and Derrick are hiding in the big locker and overheard what Nawt said to Swackhammer. Shelby: (Shocked and Softly) From the NBA?

Mr. Swackhammer: (Pushing Pound and Bang aside and sees The Twins) Ah, it smells like two spies. Derrick: (Chuckling nervously) Look, guys. Can we just talk about this one? (Squeaks fearfully as they corner them) Pound: (Grabs Derrick's neck out of the locker and hold him up high) Who invited you, boy? Derrick: (breathing) Nobody. My sister and I hear you and the ugly teammates stole talents from the NBA players. Bang: It's that so, you meddling kid? Bupkus: (Grabs Shelby's arm) Hey, girlie. How about a dinner with me after the game? Shelby: (Disgusted) Eww. Dream on, monkey breath! (Slaps away his hand) Mr. Swackhammer: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who invited this meddling kids?! (To Pound) Pound, let him go. Pound: With pleasure, boss. (He puts him down and breaks him free) Mr. Swackhammer: (To Shelby and Derrick) Are you two looking for trouble? Shelby and Derrick: No. Mr. Swackhammer: Now what it is that you want? Shelby: We just want to came by to talk to the Monstars about things...alone in five minutes before the second half of the game. Do you mind I can talk to your boys? Mr. Swackhammer: Why I should've let you talk to my boys? Shelby: Because this is a very important. Mr. Swackhammer: (Sighs) All right then. That's no problem. But make a fast because we gotta second half coming up. Derrick: You can step outside. So we can talk to these dudes. Mr. Swackhammer scoffs and leaves the locker room, so they can talk to the Monstars. Shelby: Hey, guys. We just want to came by and talk to you about those talents from the NBA players that you stole it from. Pound: (Scratch his head with one finger) Um, What do you mean? Derrick: Why don't you sit down and she'll tell you. The Monstars sits down and listen what Shelby has something to say. Shelby: We're gonna get something straight. Listen, guys. If I was in your position, I will suggest to follow your own talent and put your talent into good use and it could be more useful as well. When you guys were using someone else's talents, that is called; cheating. Cheaters never win. Derrick: Now tell me what are your name and what players did you stolen from? Pound: I'm Pound. I stole from Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers. Bang: I'm Bang. I stole from Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. Nawt: I'm Nawt. I stole from Brandon Ingram of the Los Angeles Lakers. Bupkus: I'm Bupkus. I Stole from Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Blanko: I'm Blanko. I stole from Kristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks. Monstars: And we're the Monstars from the Moron Mountain. Pound: Swackhammer is our boss. Here's the side of the story. Our boss needs the new attraction for his theme park and his business. Our mission is to find Looney Tunes and turn them to slaves, but Bugs Bunny challenge us to the basketball game. So, we find some NBA players and stole their talents. We're used to be small as Nerdlucks and we got bigger and stronger as Monstars. That guy Shawn Matthews came here to the Looney Tune Land help the Looney Tunes to challenge us to the basketball game. And that's why we're here now. Shelby: Well, I understand your names; Pound, Bang, Nawt, Bupkus and Blanko. I understand you guys could be tough guys, deep down, you guys are all fluff, like cute cuddly teddy bears, whether big or small. My question is: Why do you guys take it from your boss? Pound: I don't know. Our boss tells us what the do. Bang: As a result, that's our boss job. Bupkus: They talking about the power and the money. Nawt: I wish I could quit our jobs and stay in the Looney Tune Land with the Looney Tunes characters. Blanko: Yeah, me too. Shelby: (continues) What kind of power does he really have over you? Sound not too crazy, I believe you guys and the Tune Squad are all after the same goal, which is freedom...freedom from slavery. Maybe, just maybe, if the Tune Squad wins, maybe I can set you guys free from slavery, away from servitude and...Derrick and I will like to be your friend as well. Derrick: And by the way, guys. I wasn't afraid of you guys at all, because I like you guys for who you are, is by being yourselves. We understand you guys could be tough guys, deep down, you guys are all fluff. When it comes to a talent, the talent doesn't come from up here. (points to her head) But the talent…(goes over to Pound, puts his finger on his chest and stomach) The talent is coming from here, which is the heart, soul and spirit. Think about it, you guys. As Shelby and Derrick leaves the locker room, In the next scene at the Tune Squad's locker room. they're still feeling sad about losing, but Shawn is not giving up. Shawn: Look I know we're down. Daffy Duck: (Sarcastically) Oh yeah, Let's hear the story. Shawn: But I've been in this situation many times before. Daffy Duck: Oh this is a piece of work. A.J.: We can still win this thing. It's not over with. We gotta come together. Daffy Duck: (Rolling his eyes) Oh yeah. A.J.: We gotta believe in ourselves. We can come back and win this game. Daffy Duck: (Bored) Yeah, right. that's gonna help us. Tina Russo (Punches Daffy's arm with her annoyed glare face) Shut it, Daffy, just listen. They hear knocking on the door they turn to see Shelby and Derrick. Terry: Where you been? Aaron: What happened to you guys? Shelby: Hey, guys. I got some to tell you and you're not gonna like this. Derrick: The reason why those aliens from the Moron Mountain got so good at basketball, it's the talent. Shawn: What you talking about, Derrick? Bugs Bunny: Eh, what are your saying, doc? Derrick and Shelby: The Monstars stole the talent from the NBA players! The tunes gasp in shock as Shelby and Derrick sits down and they groan in worry. Shawn: (Realizing) So, that's what happened to those guys. Porky Pig: I think we should qui-qui- forfeit. Looney Tunes: (Agreeing with Porky) Yeah! Shawn: (To Porky) Listen, Porky. I didn't get dragged down, just to get my butt whipped by a bunch of ugly Monstars. I ain't going out like that. We're letting them push us around! Bugs humming filling a bottle with water from the sink and writes words on a note on it. Shelby: No wonder why they played so good. As a result, those guys are cheating and not playing with their heart. As you can see, anything when you feel like playing basketball, you don't need to use your mind when it comes to play sports. All you gotta do is just play basketball with all your in heart (Points her heart), your soul (pat her stomach), your spirit, play for fun and give it your best. Derrick: Just try to follow your own talent. Follow your own heart and your soul. Putting your own talent into good use and it could be more useful as well. When you guys were using someone else's talents, that is called; cheating. A.J.: We gotta do is fight 'em back! We gotta take it to them! We gotta get right in their faces! Now what do you say? Are you with us or not? The tunes fell asleep except Bugs, he walks to Shawn while shaking the water bottle. Bugs Bunny: Eh, finished? Eh, great speech and all, docs. Eh, you had them riveted. But, uh didn't you forget something? Shawn: What? Bugs Bunny: (Showing Shawn a bottle that says \"Shawn's Secret Stuff) Your secret stuff. Bugs drinks the water and the tunes woke up feeling surprised and see Bugs as muscled man he moves around flexing them and rips his jersey. The tunes felt impressed. Lola Bunny: (Awed) Wow! Tina Russo: (Awed) Cool! Petunia Pig: (Awed) Awesome! Daffy Duck: (Impressed) Whoa, nice deltoids! Bugs Bunny: (Winking and Flexing) Play along! A.J. takes the bottle and looks at it. Then Bugs grabs it and tries to get it away from A.J. Bugs Bunny: Eh, stop hogging it, Coach. We're your teammates. The bottle went flying to Porky and drinks it. Elmer Fudd: \"Secwet\" stuff? Daffy Duck: Secret stuff? Sylvester: You wouldn't hold out on us, would you? Shawn: No, you guys. I mean, I didn't think you guys really needed it. I mean you're so tough and competitive. Foghorn Leghorn: We're also chicken, son. (To Sylvester and Wile E. who are fighting over the bottle) We need it bad. (Drinks the water) Sylvester: Hey! Wile E. Coyote: That was very rude, Mr. Leghorn! Foghorn then passes it to Gossamer. Gossamer: Thank you, Mr. Leghorn. (Drinks the water and then passes it to Daffy) Tina Russo: (Stands up) Uh, I'd like a sip of that. Daffy Duck: (Catches the bottle) Yeah! Lola Bunny: Could I have a sip please? Petunia Pig: Can I have some too? Daffy Duck: You know, this goes against to everything they taught me in health class. A.J.: (Looking at Daffy) Do you wanna win or not? Daffy Duck: Bottoms up. (Drinks the water and gives it to Tina) Yummy. Tina drinks the water, passes it to Lola, Lola drinks the water, passes to Petunia, Petunia drinks the water and the gives it to Terry. Shawn: All right, how about we go out and kick some alien butt, huh? (Shawn, A.J. Derrick, Shelby, Aaron and Terry and the tunes all put their hands together) Let's go. All right. Ready? Looney Tunes: Yeah! They jump up and head out the door. AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. This is a halftime of the Ultimate Game between The Tune Squad vs. The Monstars. As you can see, Shelby and Derrick overheard the Monstars has stole the talents from NBA players. Also they reasoning with the Monstars about cheating to steal their NBA Players' talents and playing basketball with no heart, soul and spirit.

Summary: An NBA Basketball Superstar Shawn Matthews recruits by Bugs Bunny and The Looney Tunes to take on the five aliens from the other space in the basketball game. Synopsis: Swackhammer, an evil alien theme park owner, needs a new attraction at Moron Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Giannis, Towns, Ingram, Porzingis and Embiid - so Bugs gets some help from NBA superstar Shawn Matthews. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. Shawn Matthews, his friends and his family are the OC Characters (I used five active NBA current players). But not characters from the movie that I owned. Shawn and the tunes run out and onto the court. The crowd cheers loudly as they see the team. Bang and Daffy growl at each other. Taz leans in close to camera, and Porky growls with Bupkus. They are ready for comeback. It's the Monstars' ball and Bang passes the ball to Pound. Pound: Open! (Catching the ball and exclaimed, Bugs is riding the motorcycle and dressed like a mailman) Bugs Bunny: (Stealing the ball) Coming through! Pound: (Surprise) Whoa! Shawn: (Running while Nawt runs after him) Yo, Bugs! (Bugs stops and holds the ball) Bugs Bunny: (Throwing the ball to Shawn) Special delivery! Shawn slam dunks and scores the tunes cheer. Mr. Swackhammer: (Sees the scoreboard and gets angry) No! Boo! Bupkus has the ball and dribbled it a few times, he jumped up in the air and he prepared to slam dunk but suddenly his eyes widen with shock he sees the hoop full of rockets and explosive devices. He stopped and whined with fear and he looks at the audience, and then they explode. Road Runner and Wile E. were the ones who set them off. Road Runner: Hey, nice \"kaboom\", Wile E. Wile E. Coyote: (Smiling) Why thank you, Road Runner. Then Bupkus angrily grabbed Wile E and pulls him to his face showing his teeth. But before he could do anything, his teeth were shot off. Elmer and Yosemite wear black suits, wearing sunglasses and have two pistols pointing at Bupkus. Elmer and Yosemite look at each other and back at Bupkus then they shoot off his last set of his teeth. Tina has the ball he dribbles it, trying to dodge Bang, Nawt, and Bupkus they tried to catch Tina but failed. Tina throws the ball into the hoop, earning two more points for the team and the crowd cheers. It's the Monstars' ball. Blanko passes the ball to the Pound. Pound: (To Nawt and Bang) Let's teach 'em a lesson. (Running to the hoops) As they run, Sylvester appeared with a fishing pole and he swung the pole and catches Pound's shorts and pulled them off. Blanko looks at Pound shocked, Pound stops and sees that his shorts are gone and he's butt-naked. Pound: (Covering his shorts with his jersey) Hey! what- (Smiling and blushing with embarrassment) Gossamer, Lola Bunny, Tina Russo and Petunia Pig: (Taunting Pound) Hey, nice butt! The crowd laughs at Pound, Shawn, A.J. Shelby, Derrick, Terry, and Aaron just smiled with amusement and gets back in the game. Gossamer has the ball and slam dunks it. Petunia has the ball next and heads for the hoop Pound and Bupkus tried to catch her but failed and Petunia slam dunked. Foghorn and Sylvester lift Porky, he has the ball and Pound goes after him. Porky Pig: Er, going up. Pound: You're mine, boy. (Porky slams the ball into the hoop and Pound gets hit in the face with the ball) Aaron, Terry, Granny and Witch Lezah are getting excited that the team is catching up. Granny: (To Terry) Slam me! Witch Lezah: (To Aaron) Gimme some, sugar! Terry: (Slapping Granny's left hand) Yeah! How's that? (Granny falls from the bench) My bad, Granny. Aaron: (Slapping Witch Lezah's left hand) Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! (Hugs Witch Lezah) Nawt, Pound, and Bang are charging in with the ball hoping to score. But then Shawn holds up Pepe, while he, Bugs, Foghorn and Tweety are wearing gas-masks. Pepe Le Pew: Bonjour! A little surprise for you, mes amies. (Chuckles) Nawt, Bang, Bupkus, Pound, and Blanko sniffed the bad smell they gasped and fainted. Pepe Le Pew: (Chuckling and kissing the ball into the hoop) Two points, mon amour. Shawn jumps in the air, Pound and Nawt growled trying to stop him, he slam dunked the ball in the hoop hitting Nawt in the head. Daffy has the ball, Bang tried to catch the ball but tripped over his own feet and Daffy shoots into the hoop. Mr. Swackhammer: (Furiously) Dang! Daffy Duck: (Painting Pound's shorts red) Ooh, this will be good. Daffy pointed at his shorts for the crowd and they all laugh at this. Then Toro the Bull in the stands, sees the red painted shorts and everyone looks at him as the bullring fanfare comes on. He snorts and growls angrily. He jumps off the stands, running to Pound with his horns. Foghorn, Gossamer and Porky jump out of the way as Daffy moves out of the way. Pound felt scared and he turns his head to see Toro coming at him with his horns down. Toro then hits Pound's butt and Pound goes flying above the air screaming in pain. Crowd: Ole! Tweety is flying around, Speedy Gonzales is running around and the Monstars surround them. Bang: Okay, birdie. Nawt: Hey, mousy amigo. Tweety: Uh-oh. (The Monstars show him their teeth about to hurt him) Speedy Gonzales: Together now, Amigo! Tweety had enough of getting picked on and he lets a karate yell. Speedy joins in with Tweety too. The Monstars gasp in shock, then Tweety punched Pound and Nawt, then Speedy punched Bang in the stomach. Speedy twisted Blanko's neck, then Tweety bites Pound's ear which causes him to yell in pain. Then Speedy pulled Bupkus' hair and pulled it off, then Tweety pulls Nawt's ankle and Nawt trips and falls and then Speedy kicks Bang's chin and falls on the floor. Elmer jumps in the air and slam dunked the ball into the hoop. The crowd and the team cheered loudly. Shawn: Yes! Mr. Swackhammer: (Fed up, shouting) Time-out! Swackhammer angrily walks down the stands and goes to court. Marvin blows the whistle, trying to stop him. Mr. Swackhammer: (Grabbing Marvin) Shut up, you little bug. Get away from me. Pow-wow. Shawn and the tunes head for the bench giving each other high-fives. Shawn: All right, guys, We're right back in this game. Come on now. Let's play some tough defense. (Looney Tunes agreeing with Shawn) Mr. Swackhammer: (Furiously to the Monstars, pointing at Shawn) Why didn't you get this guy? Bupkus: He's a streetball player, boss. Nawt: (Agreeing with Bupkus) Yeah, boss, a streetball player. Mr Swackhammer: (Dryly) Looks like a professional basketball player to me. Blanko: Yeah, me too, sir. Pound, Bang, Bupkus and Nawt: (Glares and yells at Blanko) Shut up, Blanko! Mr Swackhammer: (Shushing Blanko) He's the one I want for Moron Mountain. Shawn, Shelby, Derrick and Bugs overheard everything what Swackhammer said and had enough. Shawn: (Angrily) Excuse me! (This got Swackhammer's attention and turns to face him) Mr. Swackhammer: Are you talking to me? Shawn: Yeah, I'm talking to you, you want a piece of us? Come and get it. Swackhammer smiled and chuckled evilly and walks up to Shawn, Shelby and Derrick. Bupkus: (Smirking) Uh-oh. Mr. Swackhammer: What do you have in mind, young man? Shelby: (To Shawn) Allow me, bro. (To Mr. Swackhammer) It would be wise for you to leave them alone, sir. Besides, I think the Monstars had enough of you, you can't tell them what to do either, also, I think you need to stop smoking, because smoking could be very bad for your health, also stains your teeth and it may give you a short life to live. Derrick: And on top of that, how about we raise the stakes a little bit? Mr. Swackhammer: (Puffing on his cigar) Hmm. Interesting. But kind of raising the stakes are you talking about? Shawn: If we win, you give the NBA players their talent back and to add to it, you will quit smoking, I am going to let Shelby and Derrick set the Monstars free from slavery, because I think the Monstars deserved to be free. Mr. Swackhammer: But what if we win? Shawn: If you win? Mr. Swackhammer: Uh-huh. Shawn: (Firmly) You get me. Also, Derrick and Shelby can come with me. Pound: (Smiling gleefully) Good deal, boss. (He and the other Monstars laugh with evil glee) Bugs Bunny: (Nervously) Eh, docs, do you think it's a good idea? (Shawn placed his hand on Bugs mouth silencing him) Shelby: (Annoyed) Bugs. (To Mr. Swackhammer) Proceed. Swackhammer blows smoke from his cigar and shows Shawn, Shelby and Derrick images of him being on Moron Mountain. Mr. Swackhammer: The three of you'll be our star attraction. The three of you'll sign autographs all day long... and play three on three with the paying customers. (Three alien kids playing basketball, one of the alien kid shoots a ball and cheered happily which shocks Shawn, Derrick and Shelby) And the three of you'll always lose. (A kid alien blows a raspberry at Shawn, Derrick and Shelby and the images end, Shawn looks back to Swackhammer) Mr. Swackhammer: (Smirking evilly) Do we have a deal? Shawn: (Holding out his hand) Deal. (Swackhammer chuckles and shakes his hand with Shawn, then Derrick and then Shelby) Mr. Swackhammer: All right! (Then they both go back to their teams and Bugs follows Shawn) Bugs Bunny: I don't think you should've done that, docs. A.J.: (Sighs) Guys, that was a bad idea and we're gonna lose anyway. (Shaking his head) Shawn: (Assuring Bugs and A.J.) Come on, guys. I have faith in my team. Shelby: That's right, Bugs, all we may not win the game. But we're gonna play the game just for fun. Derrick: All we gotta do is keep your heads up and have faith in our team, guys. AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. The Tune Squad made a comeback in the second half of the game. But the game is not over yet. Shawn raise the stakes with Swackhammer. Here's the deal: If Tune Squad wins, The Monstars will give up the NBA players' talent and return it to their rightful owners. If the Monstars wins, Swackhammer will take Shawn, Derrick and Shelby to the Moron Mountain and become slaves for eternity (That will be no good). Since the game is not over yet, what will happen next in this chapter? Unfortunately, I'm not finish and I really can't tell you the whole story yet. But don't hold your breath. You'll find out in the next chapter. That's all for now and please be sure to read and review this chapter of the story. Until next time, fans.

Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. Shawn Matthews, his friends and his family are the OC Characters (I used five active NBA current players). But not characters from the movie that I owned. At the Monstars side the camera pans slowly to Swackhammer's face glaring evilly at the Monstars. Mr Swackhammer: Crush 'em! Back on the court, Marvin blows the whistle and Wile E. has the ball running down the court and dribbling the ball. Pound, Nawt, and Bang charge at him. Pound: Defeating time boys! Wile E. Coyote: (Shocked) Oh, no! Wile E's eye widen with fear and gets hit hard, his body was broken to pieces. His arms and legs landed on the floor. Wile E. Coyote (In Pain) That is going to leave the mark. Gossamer: (Fearfully) Oh my-(Bang and Bupkus butt-slamed Gossamer, making him flat) Ouch! Pound: (Stepping on Sylvester who has the ball) Goodbye! Shawn has the ball. He tries to get past Pound and Bupkus, but then Pound backhands Shawn in the head smiling meanly. Elmer tried to score but Bupkus elbows him down to the floor. Foghorn has the ball, running to the hoop but Bupkus hits him with the back of his fist and Nawt kicks Taz. Bang karate chops Road Runner's head. Bupkus uses Tweety and Speedy Gonzales as a golf ball and uses Foghorn as a golf club. Bupkus: Fore! (Hitting Tweety and Speedy) Tweety screams as he goes flying in the air, he landed hard on the bench where Granny, Witch Lezah, Petunia, Tina, Dawg, Sylvester, and Taz look at him with sorrow. Daffy looks and sees Bupkus behind him, he was about to smash Daffy with his strong hand but Shelby moves him out of the way and Bupkus stops. Shelby: (Angrily halts) Stop! Stop! Bupkus! We're not your enemies. My twin brother is right. You guys want to have freedom away from servitude, do you? Pound has the ball and he elbowed Shawn glaring nastily at him. Shelby: (Continues) Your boss is forcing you, do not take orders from him, please. Try to think. I want to be your friend, Bupkus. Bupkus hear the word from Shelby and Derrick; Shelby and Derrick's voice echoing through his head, which makes him snap out of it. Bupkus: (Gasps) W-what am I doing? Shelby, are you alright? I hope I didn't hurt you. I'm sorry and my boss took orders from me and I really don't know how to stand up to him. (Exhales and shaking his head) Pound: (Chuckling)This is gonna be fun. (Jumps off) Lola Bunny: I'm open, I'm open. Tina Russo: Hurry, guys, hurry! Petunia Pig: Come on, guys, pass the ball to Lola! Bugs Bunny: Lola, Lola! Daffy Duck: Tina! Porky Pig: (Stammering) P-P-Petunia! Bugs, Daffy and Porky: Heads up! Lola, Tina and Petunia turns around and sees Pound doing a belly flop and he's about to crush them. Pound: Belly flop! Bugs, Daffy and Porky: Look out! Three guys pushed the girls out of the way and he gets crushed instead. The girls rolled around and felt shocked seeing Bugs, Daffy and Porky crushed by Pound. Lola Bunny: (Gasps) Oh my! (Crowd gasped in horror and she screams runs to Pound) Bugs! Tina Russo: Daffy?! Petunia Pig: Oh no! Porky! Pound: (Mockingly) Are these your men, ladies? (Gets off Bugs, Daffy and Porky and walks away chuckling) Bugs, Daffy and Porky are flat and twisting in pain, then they becomes un-flat. The girls runs to Bugs, Daffy and Porky kneeling down to check on them. Lola Bunny: (Worried) Are you okay? Bugs Bunny: Me? Oh, yeah I'm fine. Tina Russo: (Worried) Are you alright, Daffy? Daffy: I'll be fine, Tina Russo. Petunia Pig: (Worried) Porky, are you alright? Porky Pig: (Stammering) Y-Y-Yeah. I'm o-o-okay, Petunia. Bugs, Daffy and Porky: Are you okay, girls? Lola, Tina and Petunia: (Smiling) Oh, guys, thank you. Bugs, Daffy and Porky: Aw. it was nothing. Lola Bunny: That was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Tina Russo: You did the same thing, Daffy. Petunia Pig: You really helped me a lot, Porky Pig. Lola, Tina and Petunia kisses Bugs, Daffy and Porky and walks away leaving Bugs, Daffy and Porky blushing with awe. Shawn: Dang! Time-out. At the bench the tunes are injured really badly. Wile E has casts on three of his limp. Sam is charred and moaning in pain, Sylvester has a big cast around his body. Speedy is stuck in the mouse trap. Elmer is in a straight jacket. Elmer Fudd: (feeling dizzy) The Monstars. The Monstars. Foghorn has turned into a turkey and hooked up to I.V. Granny has a cast around her neck and she is in a wheelchair. Road Runner has a neck brace on his neck. Gossamer has a black eye and a cast on his right foot and left arm Taz is out cold and Witch Lezah is giving him electric pads to revive him. Witch Lezah: Clear! (The pads shock Taz and he twitches around there are words on his chest that says \"Eat at Joe's) Tweety is laying next to a machine that says \"Acme, iron lung.\" A.J. and Shawn are pacing back and forth thinking. A.J.: Okay, we need two players and all we got is three players left. Any suggestions? Daffy Duck: Hey, Coach, listen, you got anymore of that secret stuff? (Flexing the muscles then deflates) I think it's starting to wear off. Shawn: Daffy, listen, the secret stuff didn't wear off. It was just water. Nothing but plan ol' tap water. A.J.: Besides, you guys had that special stuff inside of you all along. Daffy Duck: (Nodding) Yeah, Yeah I knew that. But listen, you got anymore? Lola Bunny: Yeah I'll take double. Tina Russo: Me too, coach. Gossamer: Can I have some too, Mr. Matthews? (Beaky Buzzard who is bandaged nods to Shawn) A.J. rolled his eyes then he looks at Aaron and Terry and he decides to have them as two players. A.J.: Terry and Aaron? Terry and Aaron: Yeah? A.J.: You two are going in. (To Terry) Terry, you on point and (To Aaron) Aaron, you on two. (Aaron and Terry smiled and chuckles happily) Get out there and guard the backcourts. Terry: (Taking off his jacket) I'm going in. Aaron: (Taking off his jacket) Me too. I'm ready. Terry: (To Aaron) Hey, Aaron. Let's whoop those Monstars' butt. Aaron: Let's do it! (High five to Terry) The game resumes and Marvin passes the ball to Lola and she passed to Shawn. Shawn dribbled the ball and the Monstars charge at him and surround him trying to steal the ball. Aaron runs to position. Aaron: (Calling to Shawn) Shawn, over here. Over here, Over here I'm open, I'm open! (Shawn throws the ball to Aaron) Aaron: (Aaron catches the ball and passes it to Terry) Take it, Terry. Terry: (Passes the ball to Aaron) Why don't you take a shot, Aaron. The looks up to see Bang roaring and jumping on them. Before one of the guys can move they gets crushed by Bang then Bupkus, Blanko, Nawt and Pound dogpile on Terry and Aaron. The ball slips out of Terry or Aaron's hands, it flies to the hoop and scored three points. Shawn: Yes! (The crowd cheered) Nerdluck Slave: (Cheering) Nice sho...! (Swackhammer slams his hand down to the nerdluck and he is not happy about it) Mr. Swackhammer: Don't say a word! Pound: (Getting off Terry and Aaron as the others get off) Big men pancakes! Nawt: Those boys ain't nothing. Bang: (Chuckling) They boys got nothing! Bupkus: You said it, man. Blanko: Hey, no fair, dudes. (The Monstars walk away from Terry and Aaron who are flat as a pancake) Bugs, Lola, Daffy, Tina, Porky and Petunia: Ooh! Two medical dogs approach Terry and Aaron with two beds. Little medical dog: Let's get him out of here! The little medical dog puts two air hoses in two guys mouths and they pump them up like balloons. The big medical dog pulls two hoses out of two guys mouths. They makes a farting noises as two guys deflates the air out of them flying through the ceiling. Lola Bunny: (Disgusted holding her nose) Eww! Tina Russo: (Disgusted holding her nose) Gosh! That stinks. Petunia Pig: (Disgusted holding her nose) You said it. Someone cut the cheese. (The Nerdluck slaves groan in disgust) Pepe Le Pew: (Putting a clothespin on his nose) Oh, mon. Aaron and Terry lands on two beds and they back to their normal self. The crowd applauded as Shawn looks on the dogs wheeled Aaron and Terry away. Shawn: How'd they do that? Bugs Bunny: Aw, anybody could do that, doc. Even you. Watch this. (Grabbing Daffy's neck) Daffy Duck: (Choking) Watch what? (Bugs stretches Daffy's neck) See? No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land. Shawn understood Daffy and he sees the time, They only have ten seconds left. Shawn: Ten seconds ago? Thanks for telling me, doc. Derrick: (taps Shawn shoulder) Yo, Shawn. Since the Looney Tunes is injured all we need is a couple players. So what do we gonna do now? AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. The Monstars refused to listen to Shelby and Derrick are saying and Mr. Swackhammer still taking an advantage of them. Since all the Looney tunes are on the injury list except Bugs, Daffy, Lola, Tina, Porky and Petunia. Also two of the Shawn's childhood friends (Terry and Aaron) are on the injury list too. Bugs was right, in the cartoon world, they can do anything (Getting roadkill, get crushed stretch their bodies, and run fast). But not in the real world. The Tune Squad has three players short and they needed two players left on the court or else forfeit. I know now it's 10 second left on the clock until the game is over. Who will be the two players? Since the game is not over yet, what will happen next in this chapter? Unfortunately, I'm not finish and I really can't tell you the whole story. (A couple stories left until the story ends) You'll find out in the next chapter. That's all for now and please be sure to read and review this chapter of the story.

But not characters from the movie that I owned. Marvin the Martian: (Worried) I hate to the bearer of bad news, Mr. Lightning Bolt Guy, but if you don't find two more players on the court, your team will forfeit the game. Shawn: Forfeit? Marvin the Martian: (Nodding) Precisely, Sir Altitude. Shawn: I don't think so, Marvin. We'll find someone. The camera cuts to Monstars bench. Bupkus talks the Monstars about Mr. Swackhammer and Derrick and Shelby's deal. Bupkus: Guys, this may sound crazy, I think the twins could be right about Swackhammer. I think they're trying to save us from slavery. We really want to have freedom from servitude, right? Blanko: Okay, I really agree with you, dude. Nawt: I'm with you, man Bang: So am I. Pound: Me too. When the light is out and people sees the light from the sky. It's The Ghost of Michael Jordan arrived, the light is back on and he still wearing the business suit. Monstars: It's that Michael Jordan? Shawn: Mike! Bugs Bunny: Mike! A.J.: M.J.! Shelby and Derrick: M.J.! Looney Tunes: It's Michael Jordan! Michael Jordan: It's me. In the flesh. The crowd cheers loudly, Shawn and the gang are surprised to see him. Mr Swackhammer: (Surprised jumping from his seat) Whoa, whoa, whoa! I didn't know Michael Jordan was in this picture! Bugs Bunny: Hey, Mike, you can here to help to play with us? Michael Jordan: Um, no. But I'm here to help you guys. And you need two more players on the court. (To Shawn) Shawn, I suggest you should let your brother and sister in and let them play. Shawn: (Puzzled) You mean Shelby and Derrick? Michael Jordan: Yeah. It's the only way to play the game and give them a shot. Shawn: (Exhales loudly) I guess I ain't got no other choice. (To Derrick and Shelby) Guys, both of you are going in. Shelby and Derrick shocks and they're happy to let them play the game and this is their chance to play basketball. Shelby and Derrick: (Yelling) Hey, Swackhammer! Perhaps, we could be of some assistance! Michael Jordan: I'll be sitting on the front row level and watch the game in final seconds. Shawn: (Smiling) That's our two players. (The Twins walks up to them and gives Shawn high fives) Thanks, guys. Now you two get to live up your dream. Let's go. Derrick: All right. Cool. Shawn: All right, we need to score two points… Shelby: Here's how I see it. (To Derrick) Derrick? Derrick: Yeah. Shelby: You kick it into Lola down in the post. Lola Bunny: Yeah? Shelby: You dish it back out to Bugs. Lola Bunny: (Seriously) Got it! Shawn: You swing it to Shawn over here. You go to the hole and dominate. Shawn: Shelby, that's a great idea for offense. But right now, we're on defense. Bugs Bunny: (Agreeing with Shawn) Oh yeah. Shelby: Whoa, ho, ho, I'm sorry, bro. I forgot about it. Shawn: Typical. Derrick: A'ight, guys. Now you've gotta listen to my brother Shawn on this guys. I need you to pay attention. Shawn: Somebody steal the ball, get it to me, and I'll score before the time runs out. Shelby: Don't lose that confidence. A'ight! Hands, paws and wings in here! All right! Let's go! They head back on the court and the crowd cheered. Shelby: This is why I was born. I thrive on pressure. Derrick: Me too, Shelby. I'm with you on that. (High five to Shelby) Tina Russo: (Tapping Shelby's leg) Hey, Shelby. Daffy Duck: (Tugging Derrick's shorts) Excuse me, kiddo. Uh, sorry about that. Derrick: Yo, man. Easy on the shorts, Daff, easy, bruh. Tina Russo: Can I ask you a question, Shelby? Daffy Duck: Pardon me. Um, Derrick, something's really been bugging me. Shelby and Derrick: Yeah? Daffy and Tina: Just how did Michael Jordan get here anyway? (Pound stops to look at The Twins) Shelby: The Ghost of Michael Jordan saw this movie once and Mike came here to help Shawn to win the basketball game. Derrick: Just had a teamster come and drop me off, you know. You and Bugs came at my house and Shelby, A.J., Terry Aaron and I asked you for help to win the game. (Pound rolled his eyes while listening, he growled and shook his head in annoyance) Shelby: Derrick and I talked to the Monstars about freedom from the slavery and cheating to use five NBA players' talent. Daffy Duck: Uh-huh. Well that's how it goes. Tina Russo: Wow. I didn't know that before you came here guys and neither Michael. You planned that one too. Derrick: Yeah. Hey, you see this uh, kind of big tall orange dude over here? (Sees Pound making a face and chuckling rudely at Lola) Daffy Duck: (Sees Pound and nods his head) Uh-huh. Shelby: Why don't you help your boyfriend Daffy and take the big guy. Tina Russo: (Sees Pound and cracks her knuckles) No problem. Derrick and Shelby whispers into Daffy and Tina's ear which gave them the idea. Daffy Duck: Ooh. Ooh, that's good. Oh, yes. Tina Russo: I like it. Shelby and Derrick: All right. Let's do it. You're the ducks. They get ready for the last game before the final seconds of the game. It's the Monstars ball and Marvin gives the ball to Bupkus. Marvin the Martian: Now, let's all play fair. Here. Bupkus take the ball and elbows Marvin. He gets ready for action. Derrick: Yo, spaceman, don't choke now. Come on. Come on, come on. As Bupkus, gets ready, Daffy and Tina puts on a football helmet. Daffy and Tina: It's gut-check time! (They jerked their legs back and forth like a bullet) Bupkus throws the ball to Pound and Daffy and Tina launches at him. As Pound catches the ball, and Daffy and Tina hits his stomach hard and Pound drops the ball. Bang and Blanko watch the ball dribble to Shelby. Shelby: This must be mine. (As he dribbles the ball, Pound pushes Daffy and Tina out of his stomach, holding in pain) Whoo-hoo! This belongs to me. I'm going left! I'm going left! (Passes the ball to Shawn and Pound goes after Shelby) Whoa! Don't ever trust an earthling! Shawn dribbles the ball, trying to get past Nawt. He sees the time and they're eight seconds left. Lola Bunny: Shawn! Shawn throws the ball to Lola, she dribbles it and she gets surrounded by Bang and Blanko. Bang: Get the rabbit! Get the girl! Shelby: (Jumping) Come on! Come on! (Lola passes the ball) I'm open, Lola! I'm ope...! (Bupkus is about to hit Shelby but she ducks and Bupkus misses and his hand and reaches for the ball) Bupkus: That's mine! Bugs Bunny: (Grabs the ball with his ears and throws it Derrick) Not today! Bupkus: Hey! Shelby: Watch it, Bupkus! Bupkus: Sorry, girlfriend. Derrick catches the ball and Blanko approaches him. Blanko: Bring it on, dude. Derrick: (Trips Blanko) My bad, dude. Whoo-hoo. Derrick passes the ball to Shawn and he heads for the hoop. Bang is running behind Shawn and Pound comes charging at Shawn. Pound: You're mine! Pound and Bang growled as he's about to grab Shawn, but he slipped and falls on the floor. Shawn steps on Pound's head which causes him to groan in pain. He climbs up to Pound's butt and then he jumps up and flies to the hoop as the crowd roars. Shelby: Shawn, I'm open! (A shocked Pound see's Shawn in the air) Never mind.

You guys might be able to play in the (To Derrick) NBA and (To Shelby) WNBA. Shelby: Thanks, A.J. I'll take that as a compliment. Derrick: Yeah, me too. I'll probably quote you on that. But I'm gonna take this opportunity to put NBA career on hold for while. Shelby: Me too, Derrick. I'm putting WNBA career on hold for while. Shawn: (Shocked) What? So what are you saying? Derrick and Shelby: We decided to play basketball in college until fall semester starts. Derrick: And then professional basketball career. Shawn: You know something, you guys...I'm glad you say that and you told me. I'm happy you hear that too. That's a start.

(Leaving the court) In the next scene, Where Derrick walks to Witch Lezah talks in private about things that they need. Derrick: Hey, Witch Lezah. Do you got a minute? Witch Lezah: What it is, sugar pumpkin? Derrick: I really need a word with you. Since you're witch and you know about magic spells. Can I asked you a question? Witch Lezah: Okay. Shoo. Derrick: Do you have a very special potion for the aliens so that they turn back into Monstars permanently? Because The Monstars give up their NBA Talent that they stolen from and they going to turn back into tiny aliens again. Witch Lezah: I think I have some in my bag in the Locker. Follow me. Derrick: A'ight. Swackhammer is furious at the Monstars for losing the game. Mr Swackhammer: Losers! Monstars: Sorry. Mr Swackhammer: Choke artists! Monstars: Sorry again. Mr Swackhammer: Wait until I get you back on Moron Mountain. (Shelby and Derrick walks over to the Monstars as Swackhammer stomps on Bupkus' foot in anger, which causes him to howl in pain) (To the Tunes) All right. The party's over. Get in the spaceship. Shelby: (Angrily) Hey, Short-stuff! I thought we had a deal here. I thought I told you to leave these guys alone. Mr. Swackhammer: This is none of your business, and I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling teenage twins. I heard you guys talking to my guys about things. Those boys are still work for me and they not leaving. So, why don't you kids run along and celebrate your teammate! Derrick: Come on, Mr. Swackhammer. You can't be turn these tunes into slaves and take them to your stupid corrupted establishment and you definitely can't tell these boys what do either. Shelby: (To Monstars) Guys, your boss still taking an advantage of you and pushing you around. Remember? Do you want to be free from slavery? Why did you still listen to your boss? Why can't you stand up to yourselves? On top of that, why do you take it from this guy? Bupkus: (Scared) Because he's bigger. Pound: (Raising an eyebrow) He's bigger? Bang: (Figuring it out slowly) Than we used...to be. Monstars: (Finally realizing that they're now bigger than he is) Wait a minute. (Then they turn to Swackhammer with angry looks. Swackhammer feels something is not right) Mr Swackhammer: (Nervously) What are you doing? The Monstars reach for him, grabbed him and dragged him through the court. Bupkus: Come here! Mr Swackhammer: Hey! Wait! What are you doing? Wait! Let go! Pound: We're really getting tired of you taking orders from you! Bang: We had enough you, Mr. Swackhammer! Bupkus: You just a big pain in the butt, shorty! Nawt: We can't take it no more! Blanko: You ain't cool! Because… Monstars: We quit! The Monstars ignore him as Shawn looks on with interest. The Monstars laugh as they put Swackhammer in a small rocket, Bugs, Gossamer, Tina, Daffy, Petunia, Elmer, Road Runner, Taz, Lola, Sam, Witch Lezah and Wile E. smiled. The rocket takes off and heads for the ceiling as the Monstars wave good-bye to their ex-boss. Outside the arena, the rocket blasts through the ceiling and it heads for space. Swackhammer screams as he zooms fast as he heads for the moon and he lands it on. Back in the arena, the crowd and the tunes cheered. Shelby, Derrick and Shawn smiled at the Monstars. Shelby: (Proudly) Had it in you all the time didn't you? The Monstars smiled warmly and blushed, Pound smiled while shrugging, Bang pointed his chin while blushing and smiling, Bupkus smiled and wiggled his eyebrows, Blanko placed his hand on his face to hide his blush, and Nawt smiled giving a thumbs up sign. Monstars: Aww. Pound: That was nothing. Bupkus: We got freedom now. Bang: I ain't goin' back to Moron Mountain no more. Nawt: Me neither. The boss is no more. Blanko: He's gone for good and he got what he deserves. Shelby: Yeah. By the way, I'm Shelby. Derrick: I'm Derrick. Shelby and Derrick: It's very nice to meet you all. Monstars: Nice to meet you, guys. Bupkus: Oh and by the way, Shelby. You and your twin brother Derrick are great adviser about the cheating, slavery, freedom, playing basketball with our talent and our own hearts and taking an advantage against the boss. You are a very nice lady. (To Derrick) You are a cool guy, little man. Shelby: Thanks, Bupkus. You are a great player and you still gotta learn how to play with your own heart and soul. (Hugs Bupkus and kiss Bupkus on his cheek) Monstars: Aww. (Bupkus smiled and wiggled his eyebrows again) Derrick: Always remember this, You can't play with someone's talent and someone's heart and soul. You've got to play basketball with your own talent and your own heart and soul. Guess what, you guys are great players and you played well today. Pound: Thanks, man. (High five to Derrick) Bang: I'll make sure I'll remember that, Derrick. (High five to Derrick) Bupkus: You played well too, D-Man. (High five to Derrick) Nawt: You ain't half bad, bro. (High five to Derrick) Blanko: You're a very awesome cool guy, dude. (High five to Derrick) Pound: (To Shelby) You played well, Shelby. (Hugs Shelby) Bang: (To Shelby) You ain't half bad as your brother, young lady. (Hugs Shelby) Nawt: You make sure to stay outta trouble, girlfriend. (Hugs Shelby) Blanko: I don't even know what they say. But you're cool, dudette. (Hugs Shelby) Derrick and Shelby: Thanks, guys. I'll see you soon. Shawn: One thing though, before you go back to tiny aliens, (To Bugs) Pass me the ball Bugs. (Bugs passes the ball to him and Michael turned back to the Monstars) You gotta give those NBA Players' talent back. Monstars: (Shocked) What? Pound: (Sadly) Do we have to? (Shrugging) Shawn: (Nodding) Yeah, it's part of the deal touch the ball. Monstars: (Disappointed) Awww. (They sadly look at each other, they don't know what to say but they knew they can't keep the talent forever, so they decided to return the talent) Bupkus: (Sighing sadly) Oh, okay. (Places his hand on the ball while Bang and Blanko place their hands on the ball) Blanko: Uh, fair is fair. (Pound placed his hand on the ball touching Shawn's fingers while Nawt looks for a empty spot) Shawn: There you go. Touch it. (Nawt placed his hand on the ball) As the Monstars touch the ball, they begin shake and twitch. The talent begins to leave their bodies and into the ball. Then they start to shrink down back to their small size. Their jerseys, shorts and shoes are still the same size from their Monstars forms. They're small Nerdlucks again, they pop out from their jerseys. Bupkus: That was so much fun. Bang: (Sadly) I feel so insignificant. Pound: (Frowning, while looking at his jersey) My clothes don't fit. Nawt: What a trip. Blanko: (Chuckling) I'm up for another one. Pound: (Sweetly, walking up to Bugs) Can we ask you a favor, Mr Bunny? We don't want to go back to Moron Mountain. Bang: We hate it up there. Nawt: (Showing a thumbs down) It stinks. Blanko: Um, I was thinking, could we stay here with you? Nerdlucks: (Sweetly and showing friendly smiles) Please? Daffy Duck: (Rolling his eyes) Oh brother. Bugs Bunny: Eh, I don't know if you guys are looney enough. Bang: (Shocked) Looney enough?! Then the Nerdlucks put on the Looney Tunes costumes acting like them, being funny. They hum the Looney Tunes theme. Michael and the toons look on. Then Nawt shoots them and their eyeballs bounce on the floor. Tina Russo: Looks like they looney enough. A.J., Terry and Aaron runs in with Michael's basketball bag. A.J.: Yo, Shawn! Shawn! Do you know what time it is? Porky Pig: (Looks at his watches) Er, 7:15, er, 7: 15, er quarter past seven. A.J.: Exactly. You've got a streetball game in 5 minutes. Aaron: You better hurry or we'll forfeit the final tournament. Terry: It's for the charity. The fans need us in the real world. Shawn: (Hands him the ball) All right then. Here, A.J., take this. A.J.: (Looks at the ball) Is it safe? Shawn: Yeah. Put it in my bag. A.J. takes the ball and puts it in the bag. Shawn, Derrick and Shelby talks to the tunes. Shawn: I really enjoyed playing with you guys. You guys go a lot of, uh.. Looney Tunes: Huh? Shawn: A lot of, uh… Looney Tunes: Yes? Shawn: Well, whatever it is, you got a lot of it. Derrick: (To Bugs) Hey, Bugs, give this to the aliens and if case they need turn back into Monstars permanently and this is from Witch Lezah. (Gives him a very special potion) The tunes felt happy about what Shawn said. Shawn: All right, we gotta go. Shelby: Hey, Bugs? Bugs Bunny: Eh, Shelby? Shawn, Shelby and Derrick: Stay out of trouble. (Walks away) Bugs Bunny: (To Lola) You know I will. (Lola giggling) Come here! (He grabs Lola and kisses her on the lips) Daffy Duck: Oh, Tina! Tina Russo: Daffy. Daffy Duck: I got something for you. (Tina giggling) Come over here! (He grabs Tina and kisses her on the lips) Porky Pig: Er, Petunia. Petunia Pig: Yes, Porky? Porky Pig: Er, I've got a surprise for you, my lady. (Petunia giggling) Come here, Petunia! (He grabs Petunia and kisses her on the lips) The girls whoops joyfully, because they're in love. And they continue to kiss each other. Bugs Bunny: Excuse me. (To the Nerdlucks) Eh, guys. If you want to turn back in Monstars, like the twins says: You've gotta follow your own talent and own heart. (Gives them a special potion) Drink this one. Pound: Okay. We all going to share guys. But first, I drink it first. First, Pound drinks a potion, second, Pound passes to Bang and he drinks it, then, Bang passes to Bupkus and he drinks it, then, Bupkus passes to Blanko and he drinks it and finally, Blanko passes to Nawt and he drinks it to finish the rest. They starts to feel strange then he began to grow big and strong, he laughs as he grew muscles and grows tall again. The Tunes eyes widen with shock as they look up at them the Nerdlucks are now big and strong again. Pound with 6'7\", Bang with 7'1\", Bupkus with 6'8\", Blanko with 7'6\" and Nawt with 5'9\". They're transform back to humanoid muscular aliens they wear navy blue basketball uniforms with gold trim lines, white zeroes on their jerseys and matching navy blue sneakers they smiled at the Tunes. With their same voices, same attitude and different height. Looks like they not be able to steal their talent anymore and they went back to Monstars form. Elmer Fudd: Aww, \"Hewe\" we go again. Road Runner: Looks like they turn back evil again. Wile E. Coyote: I said the same thing, Road Runner. Gossamer: No way, guys. My mom create the magic potion spell for the Nerdlucks transforms back to Monstars forever. They're aren't evil anymore. Now there good guys. Way a go, Mom. Witch Lezah: That's right, baby. Derrick requested me that the tiny aliens transform back to Monstars forever. Marvin the Martian: Well, my work here is done for now. Back to the mars. Monstats: Hey, guys. Pound: Do you want to play basketball outside of the court? Bang: We're back in forms again. Blanko: We're still not going back to Moron Mountain anymore, dudes and dudettes. Nawt: We're still stay in Looney Tune Land because we're looney enough. Bupkus: All we need is a different clothes. Bugs Bunny: Eh, Okay, guys. Before you do this. Let's see you play ball without five NBA players that you've stolen from. Bugs pass the ball to Pound and playing basketball. Pound shoots the ball and he made a shot. The tunes are happy that Monstars has their own skills with their own hearts and that is a start. Looks like the Monstars still playing good in basketball without NBA players' talent and the other Monstars does a same thing, slam dunks, jump shots, free throws, three points shots, and everything on basketball skills of their own. Bugs went back kissing Lola and so does Daffy and Porky kisses their girlfriends (Tina and Petunia) as well. AN: This is the end of the chapter of the story for now. The Tune Squad won the game, thanks to Shawn, A.J., Shelby, Derrick and Shawn's friends. Mr. Swackhammer is gone for good and the Monstars is freed from slavery. The Monstars turns back to Nerdlucks (Not for long) and staying in Looney Tune Land. Thanks to the special potion from Witch Lezah which is the Nerdlucks drank them and transforms back to Monstars (with their own basketball skills and own hearts).

Kristaps Porzingis: Come on, Shawn, lighten up. Shawn: I know, and you all want your games back, huh? What little games you had to begin with. Brandon Ingram: It's hard enough as it is, Shawn. Joel Embiid: Come on, Shawn, give us a break. Shawn: Now...I'm gonna regret this one. A.J., give me the ball. A.J. bends down and unzips the bag, showing them the ball that has their talent inside it. It's still glowing, they all look at it with awe as Shawn holds the ball. Giannis Antetokounmpo: Look at that. Kristaps Porzingis: Looks like something from Star Trek. Shawn: Touch it, guys. Joel Embiid: (Shaking his head) No way, José. Karl-Anthony Towns: I don't think so, man. Shawn: Hey, guys, you want your talent back? You don't got other choice. Just touch it please. Kristaps Porzingis: I don't know, man. Giannis Antetokounmpo: Don't touch that, man. Brandon Ingram: I'll pass. Shawn: (Sighs) All right then, but know this. If you don't touch the ball, you're gonna start walking around with having a bad game for the rest of the career. It's your chance to touch the ball. Kristaps Porzingis: Be careful, Joel. We've tried everything else. Shawn: Go on, Joel. Joel slowly reaches to touch the ball. He exhaled in relief, knowing nothing happened. Joel Embiid: Thank goodness. Shawn: Come on, Karl. Touch it. G, Brandon, Kris, go ahead and just touch it. They all reach for the ball while they're touching it, the ball shakes their talents went back inside their bodies. They move their hands off the ball.

Giannis Antetokounmpo: What you gonna do, retire early? Kristaps Porzingis: When are you gonna do it, man? A.J.: (Laughing) Come on, guys. Leave my brother alone. Don't be making fun of him no more. Joel Embiid: You know, he probably doesn't have it anymore, guys. A.J.: Shawn, do you hear them? I don't think you can play the game no more. Now, do you want to make a decision now? Shawn smiles at the NBA basketball players and they smile back at him. Giannis, Karl, Joel, Brandon and Kristaps: What do you think? Shawn: There's only one way to find out. (To A.J.) A.J., can I have a word with you outside? A.J.: Okay, bro. (To the five NBA Players) Can you excuse us for one minute, guys. Shawn and A.J. steps outside of the gym and begin to talk in private. A.J.: So what on your mind, man. Shawn: A.J., I been thinking a lot about the teams that I want to play for. For instance, I was thinking about starting fresh and the teams I'm going for. (Pauses in 5 seconds) A.J.: What? So now you ready to make decision now? Shawn: Yeah. A.J.: So what team are you going to play for? Because the NBA Season starts in October and like I said, you only got two months left. Shawn: Well, I was think about going to the South Flordia to see Pat Riley. It's not easy that I'm going to say this...I'm going to play for the Miami Heat this season. A.J.: Shawn, I'm really can't believe you said that. (Smiles) I'm glad you finally made a decision.

(Give Aaron a dap three times) Marvin: I gotta say is...it doesn't get better than this and I hope the Shawn gets a championship ring if his team wins the NBA championship and regular season MVP this season. Pat Riley: (Chuckling and smiling) Alright, guys, that's a great family and friends news and I like to heard. Now enough of that and let's just watch the game. You guys deserve it.

A shooting star flies by and the moon is showing. The scene zooms down and it shows some lights and trees. It takes us down to a house on and a basketball hoop. A young boy is playing outside. He shoots the ball into the hoop, not missing at all. I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly As the boy continues shooting, a light flicks on inside his home and his dad walks to the door. The boy does not see him. His dad sees him shooting the ball in the basket. He opens the door and goes outside. Mr. Sturtridge: Samuel? Samuel turns around and sees his dad walking to him. Mr. Sturtridge: What are you doing out here? It's after midnight. Samuel: I couldn't sleep, Dad. Mr. Sturtridge: Well, neither can we, with all that noise you're making. Come on, let's go inside. Samuel: May I have just one more shot? Mr. Sturtridge: All right. Just one. Samuel: Okay. (Shoots it and makes one point) Mr. Sturtridge: (Chuckles) That's good. Shoot again. (Passes him the ball) Samuel shoots again and makes another point. His dad catches it and makes a smile. Mr. Sturtridge: Very nice. (Passes him the ball) Go ahead, shoot until you miss. Samuel: Do you think if I get good enough, I can be an athlete? (Shoots it again and makes another point) Mr. Sturtridge: Hey. (Catches it) You're pretty good. Keep shooting if you want. (Passes him the ball) Samuel: I want to play basketball in my free time. (Shoots it again and makes another point) Mr. Sturtridge: (Catches the ball) That's a good idea. You can get some good muscles. (Passes him the ball) Samuel: I wanna work out too. (Shoots it and makes another point) (Catches it) Samuel keeps shooting and making points. He is making good throws. He makes one more shot and makes another point. His dad laughs and catches it. Mr. Sturtridge: All right, let's slow down. Don't you think you ought to get a little sleep first? (Hands him the ball) Samuel: And once I've done all that... I wanna play other games, like golf. Mr. Sturtridge: Golf. That's a good sport. When you've finished with that, I suppose you're gonna fly, huh? Just before they could go inside the house, Samuel stops. He looks at his dad and then turns around and faces the basketball hoop. He wants to try something. He runs to the basket, dribbling it twice. As he runs, we see images of our favorite athlete, Michael Jordan playing basketball. And then he jumps, tries to slam it, Michael slams dunk. Scene showing us images of him playing in College and in the NBA, winning the games, trophies, medals and championships.

Michael: I just feel at this time that I've reached the pinnacle of my basketball career and I must retire. The one good thing that comes out of this is that my father had the opportunity to see me play my last basketball game. And that means a lot to me. Reporter: What are you gonna do now? Michael: Well, I've never really told anybody this, except for one person, but I think I'm going to play professional baseball. All the reporters ask him questions. Reporter 2: What position will you play? Michael: I don't know. As a kid, I was a pitcher. I think it'd be kinda hard for me to pitch, I think I'm gonna play in the outfield. It was on a public TV telling of the past, Where a people are watching and listening to Michael. It is a young man named Davey Towers and his friends. Some are cartoon characters. They knew that Michael once retired from basketball. Mrs. Brisby: Why would he retire? Fievel: Yeah. He's great at basketball. It won't be the same without him. Tony: Maybe he just doesn't play anymore. Davey: Guys, did you hear him? His dad passed away and though he managed to see his last game before he died. Hannah: It's so sad that his dad passed away. Tanya: I know. Justin: And if we were basketball players and our dads passed away, we'd retire too, you know. Zach: Yeah, but why does he have to be sad about it? He knew that one day, his father would die. Tony: Hey, Zach. You know you're not helping. Like Justin said, we'd retire from sports if we lost someone we love. Hannah: Like Noah. Davey: (Sighs) Yes, like Noah. He was a good friend. Roger: Hey, I got it! How about we see Michael's first baseball game? Davey: That's a good idea. We can go see the game on the TV here tomorrow. Hannah: That is a great idea. As they discuss their plan, we zoom up on the sky and we past the moon and into space. In space, there is a sign on a rock. It says, \"Amusement Park.\" on the right. We see three planets and an asteroid that has words on it. \"Moron Mountain.\", it says. A rocket zooms by it and the scene zooms in on it. A spaceship is about to land, but it doesn't and flies away. The park is an alien park with an alien head as an entrance. The gate opens for us and continues to zoom in as we go inside the park. The park has a lot of rides. The scene shows a robot alien zapping at ships around it. It continues zapping until it got a target and the ship flies off and then it crashes in the parking lot and the two aliens are okay. The little one is not happy. Kid alien: Let's get out of here, Dad. This stinks. Don't bring me here anymore, all right? In a room, someone is watching and hearing to the boy. Kid alien (On TV): Don't bring me here anymore, all right? The alien turns off the TVs and is sitting down by his deck. Small alien creatures appear and give him service. His name is Swackhammer, the owner and master of Moron Mountain. The small ones are called the Nerdlucks. Swackhammer: Are you listening? Did you hear him? Did you hear him? That little brat is right. I told you, if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand times! We need new attractions! All: Right! Swackhammer: New ones! Nawt: Uh, huh. Swackhammer: Get it? Nawt: Big, shiny new things. (Filing Swackhammer's nails) Bang: Absolutely, sir. Swackhammer: Look at me. Look at me and listen. The customer is always right! (Burns Pound's butt and Pound jumps off the desk, screaming) The customer is always right! All: Exactly! Swackhammer: (Lights his cigar and smokes) Always! (Drools on Blanko) All: Right! Swackhammer: Sam! Get in here! A boy comes in the room. His name is Sam, Sam Sturtridge. He is being held hostage and was always being pushed around and treated like his slave. Sam hated it here and Swackhammer's constant abuse made Sam very angry. Sam: What do you want!? Swackhammer: Help me come up with ideas for the park! Sam: Compared to what!? Swackhammer: (Gets up from his chair and walks around) Okay, we need something. (Hits Nawt and Bupkus down) We need something... (Hits Pound and Blanko down too) Nutty! Nawt: Nutty! Swackhammer: Something wacky. As he sits back down, he sits on the remote and turns back on the TVs and they show the Looney Tunes. But he doesn't notice yet. Nawt: Wacky! Swackhammer: We need something, something, something, we need something... Bupkus: Looney? (Covers his mouth) Oops! Nawt: (Points at the TVs) Looney. Thank you! Swackhammer: Looney? Sam: Look behind you! He turns around and sees the Looney tunes on the TVs. Like Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote, Road Runner and the famous Bugs Bunny. Swackhammer: (Smiles) Yes! Looney! Yes! Now you're talking! Looney! Looney, that's it! That's the word i was looking for! Looney. Get the Looney Tunes. Bupkus: (Jumps up) Looney Tunes! Swackhammer: Bring them here. Blanko: Sir, just noticing, sir. They're from earth. What if they can't come? Swackhammer: (Glares at him) What did you say? What if they can't come? (Grabs Blanko by the neck and raises him to his face) Make them. Blanko: (Strained voice) Cool. Swackhammer: Make them! (Laughing) Looney! Pound: We're gonna get them! Swackhammer: Sam, you go with them. Sam: (Unimpressed) Oh, that's great. The scene leaves the room by the window as we zoom away from Moron Mountain. What will happen to the Looney Tunes? Can Davey and his friends stop this threat?[Chapter 3] Back on earth, scene zooms in on a baseball field, where Michael is having his first baseball game. And he is at bat. He swings the bat, but misses the ball. Umpire: Strike! Some of the people booed on the stand, while most of them cheered as he just sighed. At the dugout, two players are talking about Michael. Player: Looks good in that uniform. Player 2: Looks great. Can't teach that. Player: Can't teach it. At the station, Davey and his friends are watching the game on TV. Davey: Oh, man. He got a strike. Hannah: Oh, dear. Fievel: Come on! You can do it. On the field, the catcher from the opposing team looks at Michael and talks to him. Catcher: Hey, thanks for autographing that basketball for my kid. I'm a hero now. Michael: No problem. Happy to do it, man. Umpire: Let's go! Michael gets ready to swing the bat again. The catcher gets ready and gives Michael advice. Catcher: Curveball. Don't swing. Michael looks at him in a confused way, but takes the advice. The pitcher throws the ball and Michael doesn't swing. Umpire: Ball! The crowd cheer and so does the players and Davey and his friends. Player: Way to work 'im, Michael. Way to work 'im. Catcher: Fastball, outside corner. Swing. Michael gets ready for the next swing. The pitcher throws again, Michael swings, but misses. Umpire: Strike! Catcher: (Throws the ball back to the pitcher) That was your pitch. Michael: I know. I missed it. Catcher: Don't worry. I'll get you another one. Michael gets ready for another swing. At the stations, Davey turns to another guy. Davey: Norried! Norried, come here. Come here. He gets up from a nearby bench, going to him. His name is Jackson. Jackson: Yes? Davey: Watch this. Promoter: I want you to make sure that nobody bothers Michael. I want him to be the happiest player in the world. Stan: The happiest. Jayden and his friends hear this and had the same idea too. They want to see Michael do his best. They watch the game. On the field, the catcher sees the pitcher and knows what he's about to do. Catcher: Slider. Don't swing. Michael gets ready. The pitcher then throws the ball, but then Michael swings and misses again. Umpire: Strike three! Catcher: I told you not to swing. Michael: I couldn't help it. (Walks away) Catcher: I understand. Hey, nice talking to ya. As he walks to the dugout, all the people in the crowd start to cheer for him, including Davey and his friends. Even though he was stroke out, he made a good process. All the players even start clapping for him. Player: We're not worried. We're not worried. Michael continues to the dugout and he sits down. Cameras are flashing and taking pictures of him. All the players talk to him. Player: Come on, Michael. Good job, buddy. Player 2: Don't worry. Good try. Good hustle. Player 3: Good cut, Michael. Good cut. Player 4: That was a strikeout, Mike. That was a good-looking strikeout. Real good. Player 5: I mean, you look good when you strike out, man. When I strike out, man, it looks nasty, man. At least you look good, man. As he sits down, gets on his stomach and leans down to see Michael. He waves and smiles. Stan: Oh, hi. Hi, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan, I'm Stan- (Leans too far and falls) Oh, my gosh! Stan falls in the dugout and lands on his back, hurting himself. All the players look at him as he gets up and sits by Michael, groaning and moaning in pain. Michael: You all right? That was a nasty fall. Stan: Yeah. (Looks at him and shakes) Oh, i'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan. I'm the Barons' new publicist. I'm here to make your life easier. You want me to drive you somewhere, i will drive you anywhere. You want me to pick up your laundry, baby-sit your kids, i will do it. I am here to personally guarantee that no one will ever bother you. As they talk, Davey and his friends come down to the bench Jackson was at earlier. Davey: How are you? Jackson: (Turns to see them) I'm good. Yourself? Davey: My name is Davey Towers. And these are my friends and brothers. Roger, Hannah, Tanya, Tony, Zach, Fievel, and Mrs. Brisby. Jackson: And you must be watching the TV over there. Tanya: Yep, we are. Michael Jordan was real great in the NBA. Tony: He did all right out there too. He did his best. Roger: Yeah, like he said. Hannah: And we were wondering if we can hang out with you. Davey: If that's okay with you, of course, Jackson. Jackson: Yeah, I'd like that. Davey: (Smiles, shakes his hand) Thank you. As they talk more, a spaceship flies by. Everyone, sees this and watch it fly in the air and disappear behind the trees. All the people get nervous and confused. Fievel: (To Davey) What was that? Davey: I don't know. But I can tell it ain't right. Davey sits down with the team. He has thoughts about that ship he saw. He has a bad feeling about it.[Chapter 4] Back on Earth, the scene zooms in on a baseball field, where Michael is having his first baseball game. And he is at bat.

He has a bad feeling about it.[Chapter 5] Back on the real world, Jackson drives Davey, Hannah and their friends to Davey's house. Davey: Sorry if it's taking so long. Jackson: Davey, don't worry about it. Davey: That exit wasn't clearly marked. Hold up. Hold up! Right here! Jackson: What, here? Davey: Yes. Stan stops the car and pulls out in front of Davey's house. Jackson and their friends look at the house and like it. Davey: Thanks for the ride, Jackson. I appreciate it. Jackson: No problem. Davey: (Tries to get out) Jackson. Jack? Can I get out of here? The door doesn't work. Jackson: Oh! Sorry. I-I-(Gets out of the car and goes around) I forgot to tell you it's a classic. It's a classic, but it's got a few peccadilloes. Hold on just a second. (Taps the door and it opens) Davey: (Gets out as the others get out of their vehicle) Huh, a few, huh? It's smoking, too, man. You need to get that checked. As they talk, a dog is in the backyard and in his doghouse, resting. He sees Davey and the others. Davey: Thanks for the ride. (Takes his bag from the back seat and puts it around his shoulder) Jackson: (Looks at the house) Ohh... oh, this is nice. This is a nice house. Davey: Thanks. Fievel: Wow! Feast your eyes on this beauty! Jackson: (Steps forward) If you need anything around the house, I'd be more than happy to help you out. Davey: Thanks. Jackson: Anything you need? Davey: Nah. You gave me a ride. I appreciate it. Jackson: Okay. Davey: Tomorrow, I'll drive. But thanks. Jackson: Why? Too conspicuous? Davey: (Smiles) Yeah. Jackson: (Mutters) All right. (Goes to the driver seat) Davey: Bye! Hannah: That guy really wanted to help you out. That was really nice of him. Zach: Oh, please. Tanya: Leave it, Zach. He gave Davey a ride home and let us come along. So drop your attitude. Jackson drives away and they head for the front door. The dog runs to them. He panting and breathes heavily and growls as he runs. Tanya sees him and screams. Tanya: (Screams) A dog! (Runs behind Fievel) Davey: (Sees the dog running to him) Hi there, dog. The dog then jumps to Davey and starts licking him. Davey: Ooh! Ooh! Get off! That's enough! Boy: (Runs out of the house and to Davey) David, are you okay? Get off of him, dog! Come on! Davey: Get down! Git! Oh! Boy: Come on! Get off him! (Grabs him by the collar and pulls him away) Pooch, not again! Get off before I clobber you! (Gets him off of Davey) Come on, Come on! Hannah and Roger go to help Davey. Davey: Hi, dad. Mr. Towers: Hey, hey, hey. People driving by: (Wave to him) Bye, Davey! Davey looks at them and smiles. Then, his mom goes up to him. Mrs. Towers: Hi, Davey! (Notices his face) Ohh, you're all covered with drool, baby. Davey: That's the dog. She laughs and they walk inside the house and she sees Davey and the others. Mrs. Towers: Oh, who are they? Davey: These are my friends. Hannah, Tanya, Zach, Tony, Fievel, Roger and Mrs. Brisby. It's nice to see you again. Mr. and Mrs. Towers: Nice to see you again too. They walk inside and Davey puts down his bag and go into the living room. Zach, Roger, Tanya, Tony, Fievel, and Brisby follow Davey and Hannah into the kitchen. Davey: (Inspecting a cooking pot) Red cabbage. Mrs. Towers: No, that's for tomorrow night. We're having chicken and collard greens. Davey: Good. Mr. Towers: Is everything okay? Tanya: I read he once stunk up the place. baseball's a good idea. Mrs. Brisby: Who? Davey: I think she means Michael Jordan. Don't worry. I'm sure everything will turn out fine. In the living room, everyone watches the news on TV. It's about Michael at a baseball game. Newsman: It was another career day for Michael Jordan at Barons' field this afternoon. Let's face it... Fievel: Uh, Davey, guys? You'd better get in and see this. Zach: What are you guys watching? They all go in the living room and see the news on TV and they all sit down to watch. Newsman: That day he went 0 for 4 with 3 strikeouts. Roger: Is this the only thing on TV? Newsman: That brings his batting average down to an anemic .214, which also happens to be his playing weight. Baseball bat? Get this guy a tennis racket! They show the strikeouts Michael had one time. Davey didn't want to see it again. Tony: Did everyone get mad at him? Mrs. Brisby: No. Worse. Everyone was real nice about it. Newsman: Michael, I know Golf is your sport, but not here. Tony: I think you should open up your stance a little. It might make you more aggressive at the plate if you do it. Hannah: Do you think so? I'll try to remember that. Newsman: Watching this hurts me more than it hurts you. Davey: (Picks up the remote) I don't think we should watch that. It's in the past. Don't hold on to that. He changes the channels to find something for he and his friends to watch. He finds a channel that has Road Runner. Davey: (Puts down the remote) That's it! Road Runner! Beep-beep! (His friends all laugh) Davey and his friends stay in the living room to watch Road Runner. Wile E has a anvil as his wire goes down, sending him to the road. Road Runner stops in front of him and goes to the other way. Then Porky Pig comes in. Davey and his friends got confused. Porky shouldn't be in this. Porky: (Jumps in front of the screen) Stop this cartoon! (Panting) (To Wile E and Road Runner) We've got an emergency cartoon character union meeting to go to. Davey and his friends got alarmed about this. Road Runner: Meep-meep! (Runs off) Porky: Hey! (Runs after him) Wait for- Wait-hold your horses! Wile E puts down his anvil to join them, but before he could walk away, he forgot about the wire. His eyes widen and then he zooms up in the air. Then nothing else happens on TV. Fievel: Hang on. Where'd they go? Tanya: Oh, no. Davey: (Has a bad feeling and thinks for a minute) Uh, we have to go. Something has come up. Tony: Okay. Hannah: Let's go. Davey and his friends head outside and then go in their vehicle. They set a course for Looney Tune Land. They need to find out what is going on down there.[Chapter 6] Back in Looney Tune Land, all of the Looney Tunes go to a theater for the meeting. Wile E is still flying and he crashes through the roof and into the theater. He lands on the ground in pain. Then Daffy comes in, wearing towels over his legs and head and holding a brush. He steps on Wile's nose as he walks through. Daffy: Stop the music. (Shoves someone away) Top duck coming through! Sheesh! It's getting so a guy can't even get himself wet around here. (To Bugs) So, what's the big emergency? Everyone turned their attention to Bugs, who is tied up in chains and the Nerdlucks and Sam are standing him. Bugs: Uh, these little guys would like to make an announcement. (Passes the mic to Pound) Here you go, shorty. Pound: (Goes to the mic) Alright, alright. (Clears throat) You, all of you...are now our prisoners! There was a moment of silence and then they all start laughing. Sylvester: (Chuckles) Ohh, we're in big trouble now. Pound got nervous now as he looks around. Then, Nawt takes the mic and speaks with Blanko. Nawt: We are taking you to our theme park in outer space. Blanko: No fooling. Nawt: Where you will be our slaves and placed on display for the amusement of our paying customers. Everyone just chuckle and rolled their eyes. Daffy: Oh, fear clutches my breast. (Laughing with everyone as he and Sylvester leave) Yosemite Sam: (Firing his guns and jumping onto the stage) We ain't a-going nowheres! He points his guns at Pound, but Pound pulls out his laser gun and zaps Yosemite with it, making him hurt and small. His clothes, hat and guns are gone, so is his hair and mustache. All that's left is his underwear. All of the tunes see this and put their hands up, so does Daffy, who gets on his kneels. They point their lasers at them. Sam feels sorry for all of them. He wishes he could do something about this. Bugs: (Gets the chains off him) Eh, not so fast, doc. You just can't turn us into slaves. That would be bad. You've gotta give us a chance to defend ourselves. Pound: (Points his gun at Bugs) Oh, yeah? Who says? Sudden, a couple of blasts knock out the laser guns from the aliens' hands and were damaged and destroyed. All of the tunes turn around and see who did that. It is Davey, who stands at the entrance, holding his gun. All of the tunes cheer. Davey: I do. (Blows smoke from his gun and puts it away and pulls out his badge) And you are under arrest. Bang: Yeah, right. You and what army? Davey: Me and this army. (Snaps his fingers and the team appear) Roger Rabbit: (Pops out from behind Davey) You are in big trouble now. Fievel: (Pops out of the curtain along with Mrs. Brisby and Tanya and points his popguns at the Nerdlucks) Not so fast, me buckos! Don't move a muscle! Hannah: (Comes through the door behind Davey and Roger) All exits have been sealed. Davey: Good. Now, what is the meaning of this? Why do you want the Looney Tunes as slaves? Pound: We need them for our theme park! Tanya: Well, you're not gonna get them now. And you're going to jail. Bugs: Wait, Davey. Give them some time. We're gonna need a chance to defend ourselves. It says here right here! (Shows them a book that says, How to Capture cartoon characters?) There. Read 'em and weep, boys. Pound takes it and reads it with his pals. They see a note on it that says, \"Give them a chance to defend themselves.\" Bang: (Groans) Do we have too? Nawt: It's in the rule book. Sam: It is. (Feeling happy that nothing bad happened) Blanko: Ok, it is in the rule book. Bugs: Uno Momento. (Opens door and runs inside with Davey and his friends) We have to confer. (Closes the door) Sam runs out, without letting the Nerdlucks know. Inside the room, Bugs and Davey stand in front of the American flag, wearing military uniforms. Bugs: All right, men. It is for us to choose a battlefield that affords us- Porky: (Raises his hand) Oh, I-I g-got it. Davey: Yes, private Porky? Porky: How about we challenge them to a spelling bee? Zach: No. We need to give them a higher challenge. How about football? Tanya: No, we'll hurt them. Elmer: Say, we could have a bowling tournament. Ha ha ha ha ha. Sylvester: Thuffering thuccotash! What's wrong with all of ya? I thay we get a ladder, wait 'til the old lady's out of the room, then grab that little bird! Sylvester imagines his plan about Tweety. He pretends he has Tweety in his hands as he wheezes. Bugs: (Calms him down) Whoa, whoa. Take a deep breath, Sly. Tony: We're talking about the aliens, not Tweety. Davey: Ok, let's analyze the competition. (Pulls down a chart of the aliens) Now, what are we looking at here? We got a small race of invading aliens. Daffy: Small arms, short legs. (Pretending to be Blanko) Roger: Not very fast. Sylvester: Tiny little guys. Porky: Can't jump high. Mrs. Brisby: And can't hit or kick. They all look at the chart and they all go, \"Uh-huh.\" at the same time. They all have the same idea. They pull up the chart and go outside to see them. Davey has a basketball with him and he looks at them. Davey: We challenge you to a basketball game. (Spins the ball around with his finger) Pound: Alright, basketball it is! Bang: Basketball! Nawt: Basketball. (Jumps up and down) Bupkus: Oh, boy, oh, boy. Blanko: Alright! (Stops and thinks) What is basketball? Bupkus: What's that? Nawt: Beats me. Bang: We didn't have that in school. Roger: Oh, boy. I had a feeling that they didn't know what it is. Bugs: Lights! The lights turn off as a movie program starts. Foghorn is trying to find his seat as he is in the way of everyone's view. Foghorn: Pardon me. Dawg: Hey! Down in front! (Throws his popcorn at Foghorn) Foghorn gets hit in the head by the popcorn and falls down, letting everyone see the movie as it starts. It shows basketball history. Narrator: An exhilarating team sport currently growing rapidly in popularity is basketball. Unlike football and baseball, only five men can play on a team. It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle game that requires quick wits and even faster reflexes. Here's how it's done in the professional ranks, the national basketball association, featuring the best players in the world. The aliens are watching and listening to the movie. They all smile as they got their minds on the game now. And they have an idea. Nawt: The best players in the world. Bupkus: The best! Pound smiles at the idea. They see this and have a bad feeling. He knows they're gonna do something. And he won't like it. Can our heroes beat them in their challenge?[Chapter 7] Areba Street Courts at night. Inside, a basketball practice game is on. It is in the middle of one the first period and the one team is in the lead by two. 4 to 2. They score again and the gold jersey boys have the ball. Suddenly, the Nerdlucks arrive is disguise. They sit down and Nawt looks out to see. Nawt: Hey, it's basketball. Bang: (Opens the jacket a little) Where? Blanko: Whoa. Now what? They see a young man score again. Nawt: Hey, hey! Pound: What, what? Nawt: Look again. Bang: Close it up. Close it up. (Closes the jacket) Blanko: Tightly. Bang: Aah! You poked me again. They look at the game. Bang: Hey, someone's killing someone. Blanko: No. Seriously? Pound: (Concerned) Wow, a killer. (Gets in front of Nawt) Let me see. Nawt: (See Dillon Lee and points at him) There, that's him, the killer! He's big. Blanko: He's good. Pound: (Pins down Blanko and smiles) He's mine. (Closes jacket) Nawt: Ok, go get him. Pound: Yeah, watch out. The jacket lowers down. Pound comes out from under it and turns into a pink ooze and goes onto the court. Dillon scores again and he walks, but doesn't see the ooze. The ooze launches itself into Dillon's mouth and goes inside his body. He twitches around as the ooze comes out of him and goes back to the others. He gets dizzy and still twitches. Player: (Pulling Dillon) Come on, get back on defense. Come on. Get back \"D,\" man. Then one of the other guys, Nikos Dalton, scores. He runs to the other side as the gold jersey boys get the ball. Shane Stoller is not impressed. Shane: (Stands up from his chair) What are you doing? Dillon is waving his hands around, telling them to pass him the ball. But they didn't. One of them tries to score, but misses. Shane: Time-out! Player: (Goes to Lee) What's wrong with you? You're killing us! Pound goes back to the jacket. They open up and the ooze goes inside a basketball they have. Bang: Wow, he did it. Pound: (Comes out of the ball and smiles) I got it. I got his talent. They all laugh and smile as they look at the ball that is glowing. Outside, Lee is sitting down, complaining about not playing anymore. Shane: Sit down, Dill. Dillon: Hey, bub, I'm fine! I am fine! (Sits down and grabs a towel) Shane: No, no, no, no. I'm playing you too many minutes. Dillon: I'm not tired at all! Shane: (To player) Go get a doctor. Back at the game, Dalton dunked the ball and scores. Then Pound comes back in as the pink ooze and he approaches Dalton. He goes inside him after launching into his mouth. Like Lee, he twitches around and shakes around. One of the players check on him as the ooze goes out of him and leaves. Player: What's up, Nikos? You all right? Nikos: Yeah. Player 2: Come on, we're ok. We're ok. You're all right. Come on, let's go. He tosses the ball to Dalton, and it hits him in the chest. All the players look at him and he gets confused. Player 2: Come on, Nikko. It's show time. He tosses him the ball again and he tries to get it, but misses again. The people try to cheer him on as he gets ready to shoot the ball into the hoop. He looks at the hoop and then throws it, but he throws it little too high and it goes flying into the gate and hits it, shaking the metal around.[Chapter 8] In a log cabin, Sam is on the phone, talking to someone while watching the news on TV. The news is about the young players. Newsman: In a shocking development, 5 young players have been placed on the disabled list in the last 24 hours, all suffering from the same mysterious ailment. Whatever this mystery is, it seems to have a devastating affects the player's coordination. Watch Nikos Dalton. Sam: (On the phone) Yeah, I'll be there in a couple of days. Put your friend on the phone. Sam watches the TV and sees Nikos get hit in the head by the ball. It shows two more basketball players, Suraj Kumar and Luke Brown. Luke is muscular and Suraj is short. Sam: (On the phone) Hallo. How you doing? You watching TV? He sees Suraj twitching around as the player from the other team get the ball from him and runs to the hoop. His friend Ian is mad. Ian on TV: What the heck's going on? Player on TV: You all right, Luke? Luke on TV: Yeah. I'm ready, coach. Sure. All right. (Spills his water behind him and turns around to see) Sam: (watching TV and talking on the phone) Looks like I returned just in time. (Hears knocking on his door) All right, I've gotta go. I'll call you later, ok? Bye. He hangs up the phone as he sees a big tall player on TV. It's Jake Fahy. He's walking down the court, like if he's trying to avoid from tripping. Sam hears knocking again on the door. Sam: Come in! Jackson: (Opens the door) Come on, Sam, It's time. Get on. Lace up your shoes. Grab your cap and some water. We'll pick up a Big Mac on the way to the golf course. Newsman: Now we take you live to the Forum in Los Angeles, where these young men are refusing to take the court. In Alhambra, a swarm of reports and camera-people and fans are going in and their coach comes out of the locker room. Shane: Guys, we gotta get dressed. We got practice in 5 minutes. I mean, we're talking about a huge fine here. Player: No way, coach. We can't go in the locker room. Player 2: We heard what happened to Dillon and Nikos. It's got to be germs in there or something. Gabe: Cedric, that was only 2 miles away. Player 3: Bacteria like that can travel faster than the speed of light. Player: Yeah, it could be Invasion of Body Snatchers. Marc: (Sighs) All right, dress in the hallway. All of the other kids put gas masks on as they prepare to go into their locker room. Meanwhile, back in Looney Tune Land, the Tunes and their friends are practicing basketball to try and get better. Davey and his friends already know how to play and they're doing great. Davey slams dunk the ball into the hoop. Bugs catches the ball as Davey comes down. Davey: Whoo! I love dunking the ball. Bugs: Ok, ok. (Goes to the Tunes) Now, which of you maroons has ever played basketball before beside Davey and his friends? They all question themselves, knowing they never did play. Daffy: I have, coach, and there's an important strategic question I need to ask you. Bugs: Yes? Yes? Daffy then runs and a random stage appears and Daffy is in the middle as disco music is playing. He is trying on random jerseys. The final one he wears is good style. He's wearing a gold jersey, purple shorts, black sneakers and has green hair. Daffy: What do you think? I'm kinda partial to purple and gold myself. It goes better with my coloring. A-1, A-2... Davey and the others laugh at this. They think it's another joke. Porky comes in. Porky: Hey, guys. (Sees Daffy) Nice outfit, Daffy. The little aliens say it's their turn to, uh, use the court. They all turn to see them working out on the other side, and they're doing bad. Davey: Yeah, sure. Let the little pipsqueaks knock themselves out. Daffy: Too bad you can't practice getting taller, boys. They all laugh as they leave. As they leave, dark clouds appear in the sky and Bang and Pound laugh evilly as they hold up their gym bag. Nawt, Blanko and Bupkus go to them as they open up the gym bag and there's the glowing ball with the talents inside it. They all touch the ball and they all start twitching around as they feel the talents give them powers. The Tunes and our heroes turn around and see this. Pound smiles as he holds up his hand and then his hands starts growing, along with his body. Blanko looks up at him and then his feet start shaking and big shoes appear and he zooms up and grows tall, like Jake. And then, Bang starts growing too and his muscles and spine became strong as they grow too. He turns to face us readers, with hie eye staring at us and then he roars, like a beast. The tunes and our heroes were all eyes widen and they look up and the aliens are all giants. Nawt is like Suraj, Bupkus is like Luke, Blanko is like Jake, Pound is like Dillon and Bang is like Nikos. They all smile down on them as they laugh. And they are wearing jerseys and shorts and their numbers all say, \"0.\" Blanko: (To Porky) Hey, little pig. (Bends down to Porky) Boo. Porky: Aah! (Looks from them and down to his bottom) I wet myself. (Smiles and blushes) Tony: Eww, gross! Fievel: Yeah, gross! The aliens all laugh as Bang picks up the ball. Bang: Time to play a little basketball. Bang then slams the ball down on the court, causing a earthquake on the court. The ground cracks and our heroes and the Tunes run around until they get stuck in the middle as it lifts up and Foghorn, Elmer and Yosemite hug each other and Daffy, Porky and Sylvester look up at them. Roger: AAAHHHHHH! What happened? Daffy: Those little pipsqueaks just turned into superstars! Porky: They're monsters! Mrs. Brisby: (shivering) No, they're giant aliens! Sylvester: Suffering succotash! (Points at them) They're giant mon...stars! Roger: (Nervous and scared) Good name, huh, guys? Bang: Yep. (Pops the ball) Bye-bye. The Monstars leave the destroyed court. As they leave, they shake the ground and a hotel building goes under the ground. Davey and his friends watch them leave. Davey: Oh, man. Hannah: Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it? Fievel: No, it didn't. Zach: Oh, great. Now we're gonna lose. Tanya: Now we don't know that, Zach. Zach: What do you mean: Look at them. They're giants! They're gonna beat us for sure! Roger: Jeepers! What are we gonna do now, Davey? Bugs: (Eating his carrot) Eh, I think we might need a little bit of help. Davey: You're right, Bugs. And I know just the one who can help us. Tony: Who is it, Davey? Davey just smiles at them, and they know who he's thinking about. They smile too, as they know what he's thinking of.[Chapter 9] Back in the real world, Sam is up golfing with two men and Jackson. They are Larry Bird and Bill Murray. Bill goes first. He is talking to his ball. Bill: (Sighs) 175 yards. Ok, little fella. You my friend? Or are you my enemy? You are my friend, right? You are my ally. You are my associate, my personal assistant. You are my weapon. You are leaving. (Hits the golf ball) Sam: Great shot, Bill! Jackson: (Clapping) Mmm. Nice shot, Mr. Murray. Bill's ball lands a little far from the hole. He is still hanging his golf club above his head. Sam: You can stop posing now. (Chuckles) Larry: Not bad. Not bad. (Walks in next) Bill: Something for y'all to shoot at. (Walking to Sam) Sam: Hit it good, Larry. Larry: Do my best. Sam: (To Bill) It's a good shot. Bill: Yeah, I know. Sam, I gotta ask you something. Young players have to face reality. What's happening to these players is serious. They're gonna need new players with talent, guys who are skilled but never really thought about a professional career before. (Thinks for a moment) You think I got a shot? (Sees Sam shake no) Come on. Really. Sam: Nein. Bill: Don't kid me. Sam: Listen, it's a man game, and you can't play. Bill: What if I tried really hard? Larry: Can you keep it down? I'm trying to hit this ball. Bill: It's 'cause I'm white, isn't it? Sam: No. So what? Bill: Larry's not white, Larry's clear. (Sees Larry hit his ball) You got it, Larry! Sam: Get inside his ball. Larry's ball then lands near the hole, almost going in. They all got impressed. Larry: You clowns can't beat that. It's the best shot i ever hit. Sam: You haven't been playing long. Larry: It's a hall of fame shot. Jackson: Real nice shot, Mr. Bird. Larry: Larry, please. Jackson: Nice shot, Larry. (To Sam, who gets ready) You can do this. Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. You can do this. Bill: Nice shot, Larry. Larry, you feel that the NBA has to face reality, don't ya? It's just gotta start looking for some more dominant players in places they've never looked before. Jackson: Just look at the ball. Visualize the shot where you want it to go. Sam: Right, right, right, right. (Takes the ball and pin) Jackson: Be the ball. Be the ball. Sam: (Annoyed) Lay off the tee. Larry: (To Bill) You can't jump. Bill: I-yeah. Go on. Sam: Close to the tee? Bill: Close to the pin, for dinner? Larry: Sounds good. Bill: I'll go close to the pin. Larry: I'll take some of that. Sam looks at the ball and then swings and hit it in the air. He watches it go. Bill: That's not bad. Sam: It's a good shot. Get down! (Goes forward with the others) Look at that. Look at that spin. His ball lands on the ground, but too far from the hole. Under the ground, where the ball is, Davey is under the ground. He hears the ball and then, he uses a magnet to lure the ball into the hole. Above, they see the ball moving around, but they think it's moving on its own. They don't know Davey is moving it. Sam: Come on. Bill: It is alive! And then, the ball lands inside the hole. Sam whoops in excitement and jumps. Everyone cheers for him. Sam: Yes! My first hole in one! Yes! (High fives with Larry and Bill) They all go down to see. They stop by the hole and Sam goes near. Sam: Larry, nothing but the bottom of the cup. (Takes the flag pole and drops it on the ground) Larry: Yeah, that's his ball, too. Sam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my ball. Jackson: Wait, wait, wait. Let me get a picture of this. All right. Here we go. Now you're gonna smile. You reach in, you reach in for the ball, and then you smile, ok? Sam: Yes. (Puts his hand in the hole and smiles for the camera. But before Jackson could take a picture, a rope appears in the hole and grabs his wrist. Before he could do a thing, it drags him down the hole. Jackson and the others get confused and puzzled. Jackson looks at the hole. Larry: Where'd he go? In a tunnel, Sam is being dragged down further into the tunnel as he screams. Very fast. He then sees the Warner Bros. Pictures logo ahead. He braces himself, thinking he is gonna crash to it. But instead, he went through it. He is Looney Tune land. He flies down from the sky and into their town. He crashes down onto the ground. Yosemite is roping up his rope, showing that he's the one who dragged him down there. Sam gets up all dizzy, with flying golf balls flying around his head. He sees someone in front of him. It is Bugs Bunny. Bugs: Oh, eh, look out for that first step, doc. It's a real lulu. Sam: Bugs Bunny? Bugs: Eh, you were expecting maybe the Easter bunny? Sam: You're a cartoon. You're not real. Bugs: Not real, eh? If i weren't real, could I do this? Bugs grabs Sam and then kisses him on the lips. He then lets go of Sam and ends the kiss. He wipes his mouth off in disgust. Then Davey and his friends show up, along with the Tunes. Elmer: Oh, look. Is that Samuel? Sylvester: (Pops out from a manhole cover) Samuel! Granny: It's the boy we've looked for! Taz: (Busts out from a mailbox) Basketball! Tweety: Ohh. I tot i taw...(Sees Sam down below) I did! I did tee our boy Sam! (Flies down) All of the Tunes surround him as he looks at them. Davey: How you doing man? Hannah: Hi, Sam. Roger: Hello, Sam. Davey: Hey! (Notices Sam's face) You look kind of like Noah! Hannah: Yeah. He looks just like him. He's very cute too. (Sam smiles at them) Porky: Eh, pardon me, Mr. Sam. Eh, could I have your auto... your John Hancock, please? Daffy: (Shows up as Doctor Daffy Duck) Back off! Let the doctor take a look. He pulls a lever and Sam is lifted in the air as he sits down on a chair. He looks down and sees everyone. Daffy: Whoops. A little high. Sam: (Shakes his head, knowing what Daffy is gonna do) No. Daffy: Going down. (Pulls the lever) Whoo-hoo-hoo! Sam screams as he goes down fast. He lands on the ground, with no damage at all. Everyone claps at this and they give him points. They gave him two tens, a 11, a 9.5 and a heart shape. Davey and his friends give him 10s. Daffy: So, what do you say we go for a little spin? (Spins him around for a moment and stops him looks inside his ear) Now let's see what we got inside here. He sees some earwax and a paper clip inside and Fievel is at the other side of the ear. Fievel: (giggles) Daffy: Say \"Ahh.\" He puts a thermometer in Sam's mouth and it explodes and then he stamped on his forehead that says, \"A-ok.\" Daffy: All right. He's ok! Sam: Hey, what's going on here? Davey: Well, I think Bugs should tell you. Bugs: Yeah. (Jumps on Sam's lap) You see, these aliens come from outer space, and they wanna make us slaves in their theme park. Eh, what do we care? They're little. So we challenge them to a basketball game. But then they show up, and they ain't so little. They're huge! We need to beat these guys. 'Cause they're talking about slavery! They're gonna make us do stand-up comedy. The same jokes every night for all eternity. We're gonna be locked up like wild animals and then trotted out to perform for a bunch of low-brow, bug-eyed, fat-headed, humor-challenged aliens! Eh, what I'm trying to say is... (Gets in Sam's face, freaking him out) we need your help! Sam: Yeah, but I'm an individual playing golf. Bugs: Right, and I'm a Shakespearean actor. (Looks at a bunny skull and tosses it away) Davey: Please, Sam. We can't do this without your help. Tanya: Yeah. We may be good at basketball, but we're gonna need more help. And we're hoping you could help us out. Sam thought of it for a moment and then agrees. He says he will help. Everyone cheer and they head for their gym. Meanwhile, back at the real world, Jackson is staring down in the hole Sam went through. Jackson: Sam? Samuel? It's me. Uh, look, I- I- need you to come out now, ok? Because you got a day at the range tomorrow. And I'd look dumb if you don't show up. As he is by the hole, Bill and Larry leave. Larry: You think Sam's all right? Boy, I hate to leave him like this. Bill: Aw, I'm sure he's fine. I think he just had to get away from that guy. Larry: Oh, gosh, he's pathetic, isn't he? Bill: Yeah. Larry, I'm gonna give us both 2s back there. We weren't in any kind of emotional state to putt. Larry: I think that's fair. Bill and Larry put their golf clubs in the trunk and they get in their cart and drive away. Bill: Now, if Sam's gone, his friends are gonna need some new people. There's room at the top. An exciting kinda guy who could maybe even perform at halftime. Now, are you still tight with David Stern? I mean, a phone call from you...[Chapter 10] The Tunes, Davey and his friends take Sam to their gym. Sam: Look, I want to help, but I haven't played in a long time. My timing's all off. Davey: Don't worry, Sam. We'll help you. Bugs: That's right, doc. Look at our facilities. They all look at the gym and they all have a serious and an unusual look at their faces. The gym they are in is a mess. Daffy: (Hanging on a hoop) We got hoops! (Then it breaks and he falls to the ground) Elmer: We got weights! (Showing Taz who is lifting weights, then it toppled on two goofy gophers and it carries Taz with the weight) Sylvester: We've got balls! (Opens the locker and balls come out and buries him) Whoa! Sam: You sure do. This place is a mess. Davey: Yeah. We can't practice with this place like this. Daffy: Mess? You're worried about a little mess? There's nothing a little spit shine wouldn't fix. (Shouts out) SPIT SHINE! Sylvester: (Shouts out) SPIT SHINE! All of the tunes start spitting around the place. Davey, his friends and Sam are disgusted about this. And then, Taz picks up two mops and starts spinning around with them, wiping up the place. Making the whole place clean, every corner and crack clean. The entire gym is clean. And Taz stops. Taz: Lemony flesh. Sam: You guys are nuts. (Chuckles) Porky: Correction. We're Looney Tunes. Daffy: (Lifts his butt up, showing a Warner Brothers Logo on it) And as such exclusive property and trademark of Warner Brothers Inc. (Kisses the logo) Davey and his friends all laugh at this, including Sam. But the fun is cut short as everyone hears a rumbling noise. They all turn to the doors all around and then the monstars come in. Nawt comes in with a snarl. And Pound comes through with a thundering growl. And Bang and Bupkus knocks down the doors and come in. Bupkus: I'm here! Blanko: (Opens the door and comes in) Me too. (Hits his face against the hoop glass and holds his face) That hurt. All of them gathered around our heroes, the tunes and Sam with growling and snarling. Sam looks at them. Sam: Who are these morons? Davey: Well, uh, remember the tiny aliens Bugs told you about? (Points at them) That's them. Sam: Oh. Pound: You heard of the dream team? Well, we're the mean team, wuss! Bupkus: Wuss. Sam: Wuss!? Nawt: (Jumps on Pound's shoulder) Yeah, we're the Monstars. M-O-N...Uh. (Thinks) Pound: Let's see what you got, boy. (Tosses him a basketball) Sam: (Catches it and looks at them) I didn't play basketball before. (Tosses it back to them) Bupkus: (Mocking him) I didn't play basketball before. (Laughing with his pals) Bang: Maybe you're chicken. (Moves and sounds like a chicken) Foghorn: I say, I resemble that remark! Sam: Who ate you calling chicken, you fools!? Davey: Yeah, who are you calling chicken, ugly freaks? Pound: Hey! Come here! (Grabs him) Hannah: Sam! Pound molded him into a basketball, literally. Pound: (To Nawt) Here ya go, boy! Take him! (Tosses Sam) Nawt: (Catches Sam and dribbling him around) Watch the firework! Can you believe it? Nawt then shoots Sam as he goes above Bugs and his friends, burning their heads. Bang: (Catches him) Get outta the way! (Slam dunks Sam and breaks the glass from the basketball hoop) Pound: My turn! (Slam dunks Sam on the other hoop) Sam goes down and he dribbles and moans in pain. Pound: Hey, everybody! Look at your hero now. Sam unrolls back to his normal shape. Davey, Hannah and the others approach Sam. Davey: Sam! Hannah: Sam! Are you okay?! Sam: Yes, I'm fine. (Dusting himself off) (To the Monstars) You idiots are making a big mistake! Bang: You're all washed up, four-eyes! Sam: (Getting taken back by that insult) FOUR-EYES!? Tweety: (Flies in front of Bang's face) He is not washed up! He's a fine kid we've heard of! The coolest ever! Bang: Shut up. (Flicks him like a bug) Tweety hits the wall by Sam. He slides down and moans in pain. Zach then goes to him and picks him up in his hand. Tweety: My poor, wittle cwanium. Zach: Are you okay, Tweety? Blanko: (Pushes Bang and Bupkus aside) Yeah, are you okay? Bang and Bupkus: Hey! (Glares at him) Blanko: Oops. Tweety: (Looks at Zach with Teary-eyes) You're not scared of them, are you? Zach looks at Sam, who looks at Tweety and thinks for a moment. The Monstars look at him with evil grins and they chuckle. The Tunes get nervous and is waiting for Sam's answer. He stands up and looks at them and then Davey and his friends. They all nod and he has made up his mind. Sam: Let's do it. They all cheer at this and The Monstars growled. Tony then looks at them. Tony: Listen! Here's the deal! If we lose, the tunes will be your slaves. But if you lose, they stay here and you leave. Deal? Pound: Deal. Davey: Good. Now get out of here. We have to practice now. The Monstars leave and Davey and his friends help the Tunes practice. Sam thinks about something. Like if he met Davey and his friends before, but he can't remember what it was. He shakes his head and watches his new friends practice.[Chapter 11] Back in the real world, a bunch of teenage girls are playing basketball and Dillon is walking by. He watches the girls and he stops to watch them more. As two of them go by, one of them looks up and sees him. The girl couldn't believe her eyes. She called her friends over and they came over. Dillon asks them if he can play and they said yeah. He smiles and goes in. The ball passes to him and he dribbles it, but then it gets stolen by him. He goes to the girl to try and block her, but she goes around him and scores. He gets the ball again and is prepare to shoot it. But she knocks the ball out of his hands. The girls think he is a wannabe. They told him to be gone and he leaves. In a hospital, the other young players are walking with a doctor. Doctor: Just a few more tests, gentlemen. Tests for electrolyte levels, glucose, CBCS, RBCs, ET cetera. And we've scheduled a 12-lead stress test. and neurological battery to include EEG, the reflex test... As he talks, Nikos, Luke and Jake hit their heads on a doorway and they fall down behind. In a therapist's office, Dillon is explaining to what happened earlier today. Dillon: And then this... this-this girl... 5 feet nothing, blocked my shot. Doctor: When did you first start having this dream? Dillon: It wasn't a dream! It really happened! They all keep going through tests and talking to doctors. Luke: (Stands from his chair) And it climbed up my back and into my brain. (Twitching around) Back in the therapist's office, it is Nikos' turn. Doctor: Are there any other areas, besides basketball...where you find yourself...unable to perform? Nikos: (Sits up and looks at the doctor) No! Doctor: I'm just asking. They continue doing tests and did X-rays. Then Luke talked to the therapist and now it's Jake's turn. Jake: I've got other skills. I could go back and work on the farm. Doctor: Really? Jake: Or maybe I could go back to the jungle and be a missionary again. Now it's Suraj's turn. Muggsy: What are you saying, that I'm trying to disobey my ma? Doctor: I didn't say that. You did, Suraj. Suraj: But I love my ma. Back at the , they are on wheelchairs. Luke: I've been MRI'D, EKG'D, X-rayed, laser beamed... Nikos: They still can't find anything wrong with us. Suraj: Hey, maybe there's nothing wrong with us. Luke: That's right, Suraj. Maybe it's just in our heads. Suraj: We're fine. It's just some psychosomatic deal or something to do with the moon or the alignment of the planet. In a church, Dillon is praying to the lord to all the mistakes he made. Dillon: I promise I'll never swear again. I'll never get another technical. I'll never trash-talk. (Thinks of another) I'll never hurt my friends again. Back at the golf course, Jackson is digging through the hole Sam went through. A golfer goes to him and sees what he's doing. Dirt is already surrounding Jackson. Golfer: What are you doing? Jackson: (Stops and turns to him) I'm, uh... fixing a divot. Golfer: Oh. (Walks back to his friends) He's fixing a divot! After he leaves, he continues digging and he digs faster.[Chapter 12] Back in Looney Tune Land and in the gym, all of the tunes and our heroes are practicing. Only our heroes are doing good, the tunes are messing around. Yosemite starts shooting the ball in the air and it flies, it hits Daffy in the butt and he falls to the ground. As he is in pain, the ball falls and hits his head and dribble and Wile E picks it up. Then Road Runner comes and takes it from him and starts running around the gym. Davey and Sam are watching him going around and around them and then he goes under Sam and crashes through the wall, showing a dessert. Wile sees this and goes after him, but as he is about to go through the hole, he hits the hole and it slides up like a blind. Sam shakes his head. Sam: Has anyone here ever played basketball besides Davey and his friends? ?: Um... I have! They all turn around to see another bunny come in. It's a girl bunny and her name is Lola Bunny. Lola: I'd like to try out for the team. Bugs: (Love at first sight) Hey? Lola: Hi. My name is Lola Bunny. (Holds out her hand to shake) Bugs: (Shakes her hand) Lola? Lola: (Giggles) Yes? Bugs: Hello. (Takes a deep breath) Eh, my name is... (Belches) Bugs! (Lola giggles) Ahem. You wanna play a little one on one, doll? Lola: (Fire in her eyes) Doll!? Bugs: (Hearts in his eyes) Uh-huh. Lola: (Walks to the other hoop) On the court, *Bugs*. Bugs: Sure. (Runs to her) Tweety: Oh, she's hot. (Pretending to put out a fire behind him) Davey nods and they all watch as Bugs and Lola play on one and one. Lola: Ready? Bugs: Yes. (Trying to block her) I got it! I got it! Before he could get the ball, Lola spins around him and makes him tangled himself. Lola dribbles the ball and then slam dunks it. Everyone got impressed. Davey: Whoa. Mrs. Brisby: Wow! Tony: Great one. Sam: Very nice. Zach: That girl's got some skills. Hannah: Yeah, she does. Bugs: (Sees Lola coming to him) Yes? Lola: (Grabs his head and makes him look at her) Don't ever call me...doll. (Blows her ears out of her face) Bugs: Check! (Acts like an arrow) Lola: (Picks up her jacket and heads for the door) Hey, nice playing with ya. Davey: (To Bugs, smiling) Very smooth. Bugs: Ah... she's obviously nuts about me. Davey: Obviously. Pepe Le Pew: (Picks up the ball) Mais oui. Sam: Ok, who's got the ball? (Pepe passes the ball to him and he catches it) Thank you, Pepe. Let's do some drills. As he moves, his shoe gets stuck on the floor. He pulls hard and then he falls on the ground as he gets unstuck. Zach and Hannah help him up. Sam: Anyone have a pair of sneakers? Bugs: Uh... sneakers? They all look down at their feet and they are all barefooted. Except for Davey, Hannah and Zach. Tweety: Sowwy. Davey: Uh-oh. This isn't good. Zach: What are we gonna do now? Davey: I have an idea. Someone's gonna have to go to my house and pick up some jerseys and shorts. Daffy: To your house? (Spitting around) In 3-D land? Fievel: Hey, don't spit around, you idiot! Tony: Yeah! Hannah: That's gross! Davey: That's right. Just get some shorts and jerseys. Tanya: Wait. What? Daffy: Your shorts? Davey: I wore them under my pants every day. All: Eww! Ack! Davey: Hey! Guys, I wash them after I wear them. Daffy: (Laughs) Yeah! Sylvester: Sure! Ha! Zach: He did! Porky: Gross! They all turn to leave. Davey just shakes his head. He helps the Tunes go get his stuff, with Bugs, Daffy, Fievel, and Tony's help. Sam wanted to help too. He thanks them and they leave to go get the stuff from the house.[Chapter 13] Back in the real world, it is nighttime and there is a lump of grass going forward. It is our heroes with Bugs and Daffy. Daffy: The view back here stinks! Davey: Shhh! Quiet! Bugs: (Sees the house and stops) Whoa, ow! Roger: What? Bugs: We're right in front of Davey's house. Daffy: I knew that. Davey: Shh! Ok, let's go in this way. Daffy: I'd say let's go in that way! They go in different directions. They go in the house and Daffy and Sam goes to the backyard. Fievel: What is wrong with him? Bugs: He just never learns. Roger: I guess he never will. Daffy and Sam enter the yard and it is in darkness. Daffy: Now let me see. we must be very, very close. (Lights up a lighter and sees the dog in front of him, who is growling at him) Mother. Sam: Oh, no. Outside the doghouse, it shakes around and we hear Daffy screaming and Dog barking. Daffy comes out screaming, but is pulled back in. Sam runs out, but stops to see Daffy in trouble. So, he runs in to save him. Inside the house, Bugs, Davey and the others come out under the rag, humming. Bugs: Nice digs. Davey: Yeah, but don't mess anything up. As they fix the rag, there is knocking on the door. Bugs: Well, well. I wonder who that could be. Fievel: Well, let's go see. They all go to the door and Bugs opens it. And Sam and Daffy come in, all dizzy and beaten up. Daffy: Twinkle, twinkle, little star... (Falls down) Davey: (Gasps) Shh! (Whispering) Be quiet, you dumb duck! Everyone is sleeping in here! Daffy: (Gets up and fixes himself) I knew that. Sam: (punches Daffy) No, you did not, you idiot! Davey: (Seizes Sam) Sam! Save your strength! You don't wanna wake anybody up! Sam: Sorry. Bugs: (Closes the front door) Come on. Come on. We gotta find some shorts and jerseys. They go forward down the hall to look for the clothes. Bugs: (Opens door to the right and peaks inside) Nope. Nothing in here. (Closes the door) Daffy: (Opens door to the left and peaks inside) Nope. Ahh, but a very nice dinette set. Davey: (Peaks through a door on the right) Ahem. Not here. (Closes it) Fievel: Hmm. I don't think his gear is down here, you guys. Bugs: Let's look upstairs. (Going up the stairs) Daffy: Yes, one of my o fearless leader. They all go upstairs. They go to the first door and open it slowly. They all see Mikey, sleeping. They now know this is his room. Daffy: So he needs his special underwear... (Sees Mikey) Ooh! Bugs: (Glares at him) Shh! Daffy: Sorry. (Looks around) You think he's got enough toys?! Roger: Yeah, he does. Bugs: Speaking of toys, you know all those mugs and t-shirts and lunchboxes with our pictures on 'em? Daffy: Yeah. As they talk Mikey wakes up and sees shadows of Bugs and Daffy and they turn to faces them, but they already leave the room, without knowing him. Bugs: You, uh, ever see any money from all that stuff? Daffy: Hah. Not a cent. Bugs: Hmm. Me, neither. Davey: Neither did we. Sam: (Sighs) It's a crying shame. Daffy: You're right, Sam. We gotta get agents. We're getting screwed. They go to the door at the end of the hall and they go inside the room. They close the door as Jasmine sees the door closes and she smiles. Davey: Here it is! The basketball and trophy room! Now spread out and search the place! Daffy: (Bows) Yes, sahib. Oh, brother. (Turns on a lamp) I am in the peak of my form, playing second banana to some sort of a harebrain... Bugs: Yap, yap, yap. (Sees a bag) Hmm. This could be useful. Aha! (Grabs it and carries it) Daffy: (Digging around the drawers) If this were a union job, i'd- Yes, that's very nice. Fievel: (Gasps) Daffy, what are you doing? Don't make a mess! Davey: (Sees a sneaker) Oh, here's some shoes. Bugs, bring the bag here. Bugs opens the bag up and Davey picks up the shoes and puts them in the bag. Bugs: (Looks around) Where are the other shoes? (Singing) Where are you? (Sees the shoes on a stand near one of the trophies) Eureka! Davey: Roger, see if you can get it. Roger: Got it, Davey. (Gets a chair and uses it to climb) Come to papa. As he climbs up, Mikey comes in and peaks in and sees them. Roger: (Makes a trophy fall) Oops! Daffy: (Sees this) What a fuzz foot. You are so clumsy! Davey: (Hits him) Don't call him that! Roger: (Reaches the shoes and pushes it off) Catch, Sam. Sam: (Catches it with the bag) Thanks. Mikey then closes the door and she leaves to hide behind the wall. And as he walks away, our heroes are about to leave. Bugs: Well, time to go. Tony: Did we get everything? Sam: Wait. We're missing one thing. All: (Stop and eyes widen) The shorts! Bugs: (Sees a door to the right) In there? Daffy: Ok, I'll check. Daffy walks to the door and then he comes face to face with Dog, who has the shorts in his mouth. He is growling at Daffy and then Daffy slams the door and is eyes widen. Daffy: I found... the shorts. Then Dog opens the door and makes it hit Daffy. He is still growling and has the shorts in his mouth. Daffy: (Comes out from under the door) The...pain. (Gets out from under the door and runs to his friends) I'm right behind ya, guys. Sam: (Sees the dog) Oh, no! Not again! Roger: (Screaming) It's the dog again! Don't let him hurt me! Davey: Whoa, easy there, Dog! Calm down! Daffy: Nice puppy. (Pulls out a bone) How's about a bone? (Seeing Dog doesn't take it) No dice. As Dog has them trapped, Jasmine and her brothers arrive and they see the scene from behind the door. Bugs: (Pulls out a ham) What about a nice holiday ham? (Seeing Dog won't take it too) He ain't buying it. Roger: Let me try. (Pulls out a steak) How about a nice juicy steak? (Smiles) Uh, oh. (Seeing Dog showing his teeth and getting angry) He still ain't buying it. Bugs: (Hugging Daffy) Can't we talk this over, Rover? Daffy: (Hugging back) Down, Beethoven! Davey: (Nervous chuckles) Nice doggy. (Sees the kids) Ooh! Mikey's here. They all see Mikey come in and grab the shorts and try to get it out of Dog's mouth. Mikey: Give it to me, Dog! Dog wouldn't let go of the shorts as he is snarling and shaking his head around. He managed to pull it out of his mouth and gives it to Bugs. Mikey: Here you go, Bugs. Bugs: (Chuckles) Thanks, kid. (Gives him the thumbs up) Tony: (Checks the shorts) It's not ripped up, Davey. Fievel: Good. Someone put Dog outside. Mikey: (To Dog) Shoo! Shoo! Then Dog just whimpers and then leaves the room. Daffy: Bad dog! That is the last time i'm ever working with dogs or Children! (To Davey and Sam) No offense, guys. Sam: None taken. Davey: None taken. (Walks pass the kids and to the door) Bye, guys. Bugs: (Walking away) Bye-bye. Mikey: (Stops them) Hey! Davey, where are you guys going? Davey: (Sighs) Well, Mikey, you see, the Looney Tunes and the rest of our friends have a big basketball game coming up, and I'm gonna play on their team. Mikey: All right! Bugs: Yeah! But don't tell anybody. Roger: Yeah, and don't worry. We'll bring him back. Mikey: (Nods) Davey: It's ok. As soon as our game's over, I'll come back here. (Smiles and gives his brother a nod) Sam follows them out and then he stops as he feels a cold breeze. He then hears a voice. ?: Don't worry, Sam. I know you won't let my friends down. Take care of them for me, my little brother Sam looks around and doesn't see anyone or anything. Who was that and why did he say, \"Little Brother?\" Davey: (Sees Sam's face) Are you okay? Sam: Yes. I'm fine. Come on, let's go. They all leave the house and they head back to the golf course. Sam couldn't stop thinking about that voice. And he feels like he knows the voice. But he can't remember where he heard it from. Can he remember his past?[Chapter 14] Meanwhile, with four of the young players, they stop by at a fortune teller's place and they all sit down with her, holding hands around. She is humming while looking at her crystal ball. Fortune teller: I see aliens. Little aliens from outer space. They forced their way inside your bodies. They need your talent to win a basketball against...Bugs Bunny. Nikos: (Whispers) Bugs Bunny? Fortune Teller: I also see young Sam Sturtridge, being sucked down a golf hole by furry creatures and a young man with his friends. Nikos: That's it. We're outta here. (Gets up from his chair) Luke: We're leaving now. Jake: (To Suraj) Let's try some acupuncture. Suraj: Good idea. (To fortune teller) Bye. Back at the golf course, Jackson has stopped digging through the hole. The hole is now two mile big below. Jackson: This is it! This is it! I don't know where you are, Sam, but wherever you are, you obviously enjoy being there more than spending time with me! As he is talking, Davey, Bugs, Daffy, Zach, Sam and Tony are walking by, but they don't see Jackson, neither did they care about the hole as they talk. Daffy: You better hope this dude knows how to play hoops. Bugs: You and me both, brother. Davey: Yeah, us too. As they talk, Stan hears them and notices them from the hole. He drops his shovel and slowly walks a little and spies on them as they walk by. Daffy: Listen, how's this for a new team name? The Ducks! Davey: (laughs) No way. Bugs: Please! What kind of Mickey Mouse organization would name their team, the ducks? Zach: Yeah, that doesn't sound good. Daffy: So sue me. It's just a suggestion. Sam: Hey! I have an idea! Tony: What is it, buddy? Sam: The Tune Squad! Davey: Hmm. I actually like that name. What do you think, guys? Bugs: Yeah, I like it too. Daffy: So do I. Davey: Come on, we'd better get back. Daffy takes a flag pole off a hole and then they all dive in the hole. But little did they know, Jackson overheard them and saw them. He then runs out to try and follow them. Meanwhile, in Looney Tune Land and in the gym, the tunes are watching a video while working out. Man on TV: You're doing it! You're becoming mighty! Go! Porky: Come on, guys. No pain, no gain. Man on TV: I don't hear it! What is this? Now shake it! Keep on sweating! As they work out, Bugs comes in. Bugs: Eh, guys? All: Yes? Bugs: Look who's finally ready to play. They all look in awe as Sam and the team comes in, wearing basketball jerseys and sneakers. Sam: Let's see if I know how to do this. Davey: Don't worry. We'll help you all the way, Sam. They all start practicing their moves. And they all are doing good. Zach and Hannah are just watching them, and they are clapping and cheering with their friends. Sam shoots the ball into the basket, not missing and keeps slam dunking the ball in the hoop and he is doing great. They hear more clapping. They turn around and they see Jackson, clapping and smiling. He has found his way down there. Jackson: Sam! Sam is about to shoot until he heard the voice. He turns around and sees him at the door. He is a little annoyed to see Jackson. Jackson: Is it really you?! (Running to him and then hugs him) Thank God you're all right! You're all right! Oh ho ho! I was so worried! Sam: Come on, Jack. Don't hug me, please. Jackson: (Lets him go) Sorry. Sam: What are you doing here? Jackson: I gotta take you back. You got things to do. Sam: I can't. I'm helping my friends in their basketball game. Jackson turns to see our heroes and the tunes, who wave at him. Fievel and his friends wave too. Jackson: Uh, Sam, besides Davey and his friends, do you know that your other friends are cartoon characters? Sam: Yeah. So? Jackson: No, no. Doesn't bother you, doesn't bother me. Let me help! Let me help! I can help! I can help! Let me help! Sam: What can you do? Jackson: (Takes the ball and dribbles) Well, you know what I mean. I'm good. Sylvester: (Moves his belly) And large. Daffy: And a dork. Jackson: I'll do anything, Sam! Anything! Sam: (Raises an eyebrow) Anything? Jackson: Anything. Sam: (Takes the ball back and leads him to the benches) Come here. Come here for a second. Sit right here. Tweety is sitting down by Granny, and then he sees Jackson about to sit on him and he moves out of the way. Jackson: Ok! (Sits down) No problem. (Clapping) All right! All right! Let's go, guys! (To Granny) You know, if somebody gets injured, we could see a lotta minutes. Granny: (Holds up pompoms) I'm a cheerleader. Meanwhile, back in the real world and at The Great Western Forum, Inglewood, California, there are police cars, fire trucks, and owners around the building, and there is coverings around the entire building. Then a black limo pulls up and a Commissioner comes out and reports surround him. Worker: Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off. Commissioner: (To reporters) Ladies and gentlemen, please! Quiet! Listen, after meeting with team owners, I have decided that until we can guarantee the health and safety of our young players, there will be no more basketball this season. The Commissioner then walks away as the reporters are yelling for him and taking pictures. But little did he know, there is gonna be a game, somewhere that he doesn't know about. A big game will happen. Can our heroes and help the Tunes win their game against the Monstars?[Chapter 15] Back in Looney Tune Land, a sign hangs from two poles and it says, \"Tonight, the ultimate game\". Cars are in heavy traffic. They're trying to get to the basketball dome. Spotlights are shining around. Inside the dome, there is a sign that says, Home to the left and visitors to the right. To the left, our heroes and the team are getting ready. Lola: (Tapes her hand with rolls of tape) Yes! Bugs pulls his shorts up and tightens them just enough so that his tail pops out from behind. Elmer ties a headband to his forehead and growls. Taz has trouble getting his jersey on, so he spins around and rips it up and only a little half of it remains. Sylvester and Tweety are using a jump-rope to warm up and Tweety jumps off and uses black laces on his face. Daffy has on an armor helmet and uses random things around him to look tough. Daffy: Just get out of my way. Sam dons on a wristband to his wrist and it snaps on. Zach tightens his cap on his head, clenches his fists, and hits them together. Hannah takes a rubber band and pulls her hair back in a ponytail and snarls. Davey ties his shoes tightly. They face the team. Sam: Ready? All: Yeah! Yes! Sam: Great! Let's go! In the arena of the court, there are cheers and boos. Swackhammer walks to his seat on the right side of the arena with more of the Nerdlucks. Swackhammer: I like 'em! Yes! I can see everything from here. Very good. At the announcement box and inside, the announcer is asleep. Then two mice named Hubie and Bertie pull the cord of the speaker to them and decide to do the announcing for the guy. Bertie: Okey-doke, ready to go? Hubie: (Pushes Bertie out of the way) Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Riot! (Clears throat) (Sportscaster-style voice) Ladies and gentlemen, the starting lineup for the Tune Squad. Standing 2'4\", the wonder from down under, the Tasmanian Devil! Taz appears with two basketballs in his hands. He hits them in the air and they land in his mouth. He then pops them and spins around the court. The crowd cheer and next up is Lola. Hubie: At small forward, standing a scintillating 3'2\", the heartthrob of the hoops, Lola Bunny! Someone from the crowd passes a ball to Lola and she catches it and dribbles it and then spins it around her finger. Next up is Daffy. Hubie: At power forward, the quackster of the courts, Daffy Duck! Daffy: (Running to the court) Thank you! Thank you! But all he got is silence, and he is not happy about it. Daffy: Very funny. Let's all laugh at the duck. Hubie: And at point guard, standing 3'3\"... 4' if you include the ears, Co-Captain of the Tune Squad, the doctor of delight, Bugs Bunny! Bugs: (Pops out of the floor) Thank you! Thank you! The crowd cheers for him and the only ones booing him are the Nerdlucks from Swackhammer's stand. Hubie: And now the Players-Coaches of the Tune Squad, at 5'4\", 6'0\" and 5'7\", from California, the leading airmen, Sam Sturtridge, Zach Hammer, and Davey Towers! The crowd cheers loudly as Sam, Zach and Davey smile and they run into the court to the teammates. Swackhammer watches the three as he has a Nerdluck in his hand. Swackhammer: Who? Are they Looney Tunes? Nerdluck: Uh, uh, well, perhaps. On the court, all of the team form up together and they put their hands on top of each other. Sam: You guys ready? Zach: Yeah, we're ready. Davey: Yup. Hannah: This is it. The big one. Roger: I know we can do it. Daffy: I'm set to take it to the rack, Jack. Tweety: Those Monstars will wish they'd never been born. Sam: Right. Let's go out and have fun. All: Yeah! Hubie: The challengers for the ultimate game, all the way from Moron Mountain, the Monstars! Then the Monstars run on the court, singing hit 'em high, hit 'em low. Bang and Bupkus give each other the bum chest. The crowd boos them with thumbs down. The only ones cheering for them are the Nerdlucks. All: Go, Monstars! Go, Monstars! Go, Monstars! Go, go! Zach approaches them as the spotlights turn off. Bang growls at him and he shakes his head. Bang: What are you looking at? Pound: (Growls at Taz and Sam) Taz gulps and faints. Sam growls back and clenches his fists as Davey glares at them for scarring his friend. Lola and Bugs run to their positions as Zach gets in the middle for the jump-ball. Sam takes the right and Davey is on the left. Blanko gets into position too. He chuckles at Zach. Blanko: Cool shoes. Marvin the Martian approaches with the ball. They both look at him. Marvin: Ready? He then throws the ball in the air and they both jump for it. Zach gets it and hits it away from Blanko. The game is on.[Chapter 16] The ball heads for Bugs. Pound jumps for it, but misses. Bugs catches the ball and starts dribbles it. Bugs: I got it! I got it! I got it! I got the ball! I got the ball! Davey: Bugs, watch out! But it was too late. Bang hit Bugs and shoves him aside. Sam and Davey flinch at this. Bugs sees stars. Pound gets the ball, and with no one to stop him, he slams the ball into the hoop, getting two points for the Monstars. Monstars: 02. Tune Squad: 00. Swackhammer: Way to go, boys! Did ya see the moves on that one? Marvin passes the ball to Taz and he passes it to Davey. He runs for the hoop, but Pound, Bang, Bupkus and Nawt block his way. Bupkus: Come on, come on, show me something. Nawt: Whatcha got? Davey tries to shoot it, but Pound keeps blocking his way, so he passes the ball to Daffy. Daffy: (Catches the ball) Whoops! Bupkus: (Points at him) The duck! Pound: Yeah, beat up on the duck, man. Daffy looks around and realizes they're talking about him as they charge at him. Without thinking, he passes the ball to Granny, who sitting down on the bench with Jackson. Grannys gasp at this. The monstars see her and they charge at her. Granny wasn't lucky as the Monstars all jump on them. The others flinched. Jackson wasn't hurt, but Granny was. She is dizzy and seeing birds. Granny: Oh, my... Jackson: (Scowls at Daffy with Lola) What the heck is wrong with you? Daffy: She was wide open. (Smiles) Lola goes back to the game. It is the Monstars' ball. Pound passes it to Nawt. He dribbles it. Lola tries to stop him, but he spins past them and passes the ball to Bupkus. Then Bupkus slam ducks it, earning two more points. Davey then passes the ball to Sam. And he runs through the court, dribbling the ball, gritted in his teeth. Nawt: Watch the screen. Coming your way. Coming your way. Watch 'im. Watch out for the big stuff. Nawt tries to block Sam, but he spins and gets past him. He jumps up and slam dunks the ball before Bang and Pound could stop him. He scores the first points for the Tune Squad. Monstars: 06 Tune Squad: 02 Swackhammer: (Getting a relax time and sees Sam score) How did he do that? (Slams his fist down) Back on the court, the Monstars has the ball. Porky runs up to John to tell him good work on the shot. Porky: Er, nice shot, Sam. Sam: Thanks. (Sees Pound passing the ball to Nawt) Back on Defense! Zach slams into Nawt, trying to get the ball from him, but the ball is caught by Bupkus and he slams it into the hoop, earning two more points. Swackhammer: Way a go! Bugs: RR! RR! Bugs passes the ball to Davey. As Davey catches it, he looks up to see the Monstars staring down at him. All: Red light! Davey: What? Tweety: (Waves at Davey) Feed me! Feed me! Sylvester: (Grabs him) Feed you? Feed me! Tweety tries to break free, but Sylvester puts him in his mouth. Zach then passes the ball to Sylvester, and it hits him in the chest, making him spit out Tweety. Tweety: (Lands on the ground, next to the ball) Bad ol' putty tat. Pound: (Picks up the ball) I'll take that, thank you. (Runs to the hoop, dribbling the ball) Don't try this at home! (Slam dunks it) Sam: (groans in frustration) Stupid beast! Roger: (Picks up Sylvester and growls at him) Quit fooling around, and get in the game! Sylvester: Sorry. It was the Squad's ball and Foghorn has the ball. He starts singing as he dribbles the ball. Then Bang gets in his way and knocks him down. Bang: Going somewhere? Foghorn: May I remind you, sir, that physical violence is patently against- Before he could finish, Bang leans back and then spits fire out of his mouth like a dragon and burns Foghorn to a crisp. Foghorn: (Quoted the old KFC saying) Did you order original recipe or extra crispy? Foghorn dissolves into ashes. Bang hears the crowd cheer and he turns to see Davey head for the hoop with the ball. He gets up to stop him, but it was too late. Davey jumps up and he slam dunks it, earning two more points. The team and the crowd cheer and clap. He thrusts his fists at the crowd and roars in triumph. The buzzer goes off and it goes to the second period. Sam goes to the bench to pick out another player for Foghorn. He looks around and picks one. Sam: Let's go. Sniffles the Mouse: Me? (Runs to the court) Oh, boy! I'm ready! I can do this. Jackson: Mouse? You picked the mouse? Fievel: I think he means number 3. The team and the tunes laugh at this as the little guy went to Blanko, who has the ball in his hands. He watches as the little kid runs up to him and stops in front of him. Sniffles: I love basketball. I've always loved basketball. Do you love basketball? Blanko: Uh, huh. Sniffles: You're big and i bet you're pretty good at basketball. I'm small, but i'll try really hard at playing basketball. Really, i will... Blanko: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sniffles: And my mom always says, \"Just try your best in everything you- Before he could say, \"Do\", Blanko drops the ball on Sniffles and squashed him like a bug. The crowd gasp and groan. The team groaned and flinched for the poor little guy. Hannah comes in and takes the little kid back to the bench and sends Speedy in for him. Lola has the ball and she dribbles it to the hoop, but Bang and Pound get in her way. Pound: Try to get by me, doll. Lola: (Gets serious) Doll!? Lola jumps on Pound's face and rubs it down and she jumps and slam dunks the ball in the hoop, earning two more points. The squad cheer and clap at this. Lola: (To Pound) Don't ever call me...(Blows the ears out of her face) doll. Bugs: (Gives her a high-five) Nice shot. Lola: Thanks, Bugs. It's now the Monstars's ball. Bupkus has it and dribbles down the court, with Sam blocking him. Pound: Where's your defense, boy? (Grabs and spins Sam around) I gotcha right here. Davey sees this and runs to Sam to try and help him. As he helps Sam, Bupkus gets past Bugs and Lola. Bupkus: (Jumps up) 911! (Slam dunks and earns two more points) On Swackhammer's stand, he is grinning evilly, as he watches his team scoring and winning the game and he doesn't seems to notice his servants serving him food. The Monstars continue scoring points and the scoring board on the Monstars's side is going up, like a casino machine. Tune Squad: 18 Monstars: Kinda one-sided, isn't it? Pound runs up and makes one slam dunk before time runs out. Marvin shoots his laser gun. Marvin: Halftime. He turns to see that he shot Sylvester in the chest. He coughs as he sees there is a hole in his chest. Tweety flies through it. Tweety: Holy putty tat. Tony: (glares at him) Be quiet. All of the teammates gets sad, they think they're gonna lose now. The Monstars are celebrating their first half victory. They are getting ready to go to their locker room as the Tune Squad go to theirs. Sylvester: Moron Mountain, here we come. Elmer: We're gonna be slaves. Sam: Come on, guys. Keep your heads up. We got a whole another half to play. Davey: He's right, guys. We can still do this. I know we can. Zach: But look at the score. They have 66 and we have 18. No way we're gonna catch up now. Sam: Don't give up. We can do it. Davey: I hope so. I'd hate to see my friends to be slaves to those guys. Hannah: I know what you mean. As they go to the locker room, Jackson and Zach stop as they see the Monstars leave. They decided it's time to find out how they got so big in the first place. They go to follow them to their locker room. The Monstars charge in their locker room as Pound falls down on the floor and Nawt steps on his head, but he didn't care as he gets up and joins his friends. They are laughing, clapping for they think they're gonna win. They turn to see their boss, who lighting his cigar. Bupkus: It's the boss! All: Hello, Mr. Swackhammer. Swackhammer: All right, not bad for the first half, but we got to keep this up. Pound: Hey, no problem. We stole the- Nawt: (Jumps in front of Pound and talks to his boss) We stole the talent, boss, from the best fiends of Sam's who like the NBA. Little did they know, Jackson and Zach are hiding in a big locker and they overheard what Nawt said to his boss. Jackson: From our friends? Zach: Then that means, they're cheating. I knew they were cheating. Swackhammer: (Smells something in the air while getting annoyed by Nawt and pushes him away) Shut up! (Smells again) I smell something. Blanko: (Sniffing his armpits, thinking it was him) Uh, we have been playing really hard. All: Yeah. Swackhammer: Not you, you idiot! (Looks over to the lockers at the end) It's coming from over here. Zach and Jackson's eyes widen as Jackson knows they can smell them in the locker and they see Blanko outside and he sniffs the locker. Bang: That locker. All: Yeah! Blanko pulls and breaks the locker open. They all gather around and they see Zach and Jackson, who are whimpering and crying. Bang: Look. It's the blonde boy and Sam's friend, Zach! Swackhammer: (Pushes them aside and sees the boys) Ah, it smells like spies. Knowing they can't get out of this, they try to think of something. Jackson: (Chuckles nervously) You guys need a publicist? I can make you big. (Squeaks) Zach: Look, we can talk about this, can we? Can we talk? (Gets roared at) (Flinches slightly) Guess not.[Chapter 17] In our heroes' locker room, the team is still down and sad about this, but Sam and his friends are not gonna give up. Sam: Look, I know we're down. I've been in situations many times before. We can still win this thing. It's not over with. We gotta come together. We've got to believe in ourselves. We can come back and win this game. Daffy kept muttering and Tanya kicked him in the leg to shut him up. Davey was about to talk for Sam, but then they heard knocking on the door and they turn to see Jackson and Zach, who are in pain and smoking. Daffy: Looks like Jackson and Zach just had a close encounter with a bug-zapper and croc. Yosemite: Cut it out, Daffy. Zach: (Walking in with Jackson) The Monstars! The Monstars! Sam and Davey just look at them in sorrow and then Jackson falls to the floor. Zach is about to fall on his back, but Lola and Bugs catch him, who were behind them. Lola: Oh, my! Daffy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt. Sam: (Helps Jackson up with Bugs' help) Are you all right, Jackson? Davey: You okay? What happened? Hannah: Who did this to you?! Jackson: The Monstars! The Monstars... stole the talent from our friends! Zach: (Furious) Yes, and they found us and they hurt us! (Punches the locker) All of the Tunes gasps as Jackson and Zach sit down. Sam was shocked to see Zach like this and he felt anger inside as well. Those freaks have crossed the line. Sam: So, that's what happened to those guys. Daffy: This is bad. Now what do we do? Porky: I think we should qu-qu-forfeit it. Tune Squad: Yeah. Tweety: What?! Justin: We can't do that! Davey: (To Porky) Listen, we didn't drag Sam down here just to get his butt whipped by a bunch of ugly Monstars. Sam: Davey's right. I'm not going out like that. We're letting them push us around. Now, what do you say? Are you with me or not? The only ones that are with him are, Davey and his friends, Lola and Bugs. The rest of the tunes just decided to go sleep. Bugs is by the sinks and he has a bottle with him. He fills it up with water and writes words on a note on it. He walks to Sam while shaking the bottle. Bugs: Eh, finished? Eh, great speech and all, doc. Eh, you had them riveted. But, eh, didn't you forget something? Sam: What? Bugs: (Shows him a bottle that says, \"Samuel's secret stuff.\") Your secret stuff. Bugs then drinks it and everyone wakes up and sees Bugs as a big muscle man. He moves around to show them and then rips his jersey a little. Everyone was impressed. Lola: Wow! Daffy: Whoa! Nice deltoids! Zach: How did you do that? Bugs: Play along. Sam takes the bottle and looks at him, along with Davey. Bugs then grabs it and tries to get it away from Sam. Bugs: Eh, stop hogging it, Sam. We're your teammates. It flies to the team and they drink it, one at a time. Porky drinks it and then Elmer. Sniffles catches it and drinks it. Yosemite takes it and drinks. Sylvester: Secret stuff? You wouldn't hold out on us, would you? Sam: No. I mean, I didn't think you guys really needed it. I mean, you're so tough. You're competitive, like Davey and his friends. Foghorn: We're also chicken, son. We need it bad. (Takes it from Sylvester and Wile E, who are fighting over it and drinks it) Sylvester: Hey! Jackson: (Stands up) I'd like some of that. Lola: Yeah, can I have a sip, please? Foghorn then passes it to Hannah and she drinks it and then Davey. He then passes it to Daffy. Daffy: You know, this goes against everything they taught me in health class. Sam: (Looks at him) Do you want to win this game or not? Daffy: Bottoms up. (Drinks it and gives it to Jackson) Yummy. Davey: You know, I think it's time to fight fire with fire! Hannah: Right! Davey: How about we go out and kick some alien butt, huh? Sam: Let's go. All right, ready? They all put their hands together and they jump up and they head out the door. Jackson tries to drink the secret stuff, but it is already empty.[Chapter 18] Our heroes and the Tunes and Sam run out and onto the court. The crowd cheers loudly as they see the team and our heroes. They all growl at the Monstars, who growl at them back. They are ready for a comeback. It's the Monstars' ball and Bang passes the ball to Pound, who catches it and he dribbles the ball and then, Bugs is on a motorcycle and he grabs the ball from Pound and heads for the hoop. Davey is running there too and Bugs stops. Bugs: (Holding the ball up) Special delivery! Bugs throws the ball to Davey, who slam dunks it. The team cheers on this. Swackhammer: No! Boo! Monstars: 66. Tune Squad: 20. Bupkus has the ball. He dibbles it a few times and then he jumps in the air, preparing to slam dunk it. But before he could, he gasp and eyes widen, as he sees the hoop full of rockets and explosives. He stops and whines and looks at us readers, his face says, \"Oh, boy.\", and then they explode. And it shows that Bugs and Wile E were the ones who set them off and put them there. Bugs: Eh, nice ka-boom, Wile E. Wile E says thanks, and then Bupkus, who is mad, grabs him and pulls him to his face, showing his teeth. But before he could do anything, his teeth were shot off. He looks down and sees Elmer and Yosemite. Elmer and Yosemite have black suits on, wearing sunglasses and have two pistols, that are smoking while pointed at Bupkus. They look at each other and back at Bupkus and shoot off his last set of teeth. Sam has the ball now and he dribbles, trying to dodge Bang, Nawt and Bupkus, but they miss and fail, as Sam throws the ball in the hoop and it makes it in, earning two more points for the team. The crowd cheers. It is the Monstars' ball. Pound: (Gets the ball from Blanko) (To Nawt and Bang) Let's teach 'em a lesson. They all run to their hoop. As they run, Sylvester appears with a fishing rod as he swings the hook and it catches Pound's shorts and they get pulled off. He stops and sees his shorts are gone and he's butt-naked. He blushes in embarrassment and covers his butt with his jersey. Lola: Nice butt! The crowd and laughs at this, even the team and our heroes. Sam just sniggers and they get back in the game. Taz has the ball and he slam dunks it. Foghorn has the ball next and he heads for the hoop, getting away from the Monstars. He throws the ball to the hoop. Bupkus tries to get it, but he misses as it goes in the hoop. Porky has the ball and Pound goes after him. Porky: Er, going up. Pound: You're mine, boy. Porky is lifted by Sylvester and Foghorn and he slams the ball in the hoop and the ball hits Pound in the face. Monstars: 66 Tune Squad: 45 Granny, Zach, Jackson and Witch Hazel are really getting excited that the team is catching up. Granny is giving the boys high-fives. Granny: Slam me! Jackson: (Slaps her right hand as Jackson slaps her left hand and makes her fall from the bench) Yeah! How's that? Nawt, Pound and Bang charge in with the ball, hoping to score. But then Sam holds up Pepe Le Pew while he, Tweety, Bugs, Roger and Davey are wearing gas-masks, so they don't smell the horrible smell. Pepe Le Pew: Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends. Ha ha. They sniff the smell and it makes them gasp and they faint as Pepe picks up the ball and kisses it to the hoop. Pepe Le Pew: Two points. Hannah jumps in the air, with Pound and Nawt trying to stop her. She slam dunks the ball in the hoop, hitting Nawt in the head with it. Sam has the ball and he shoots it. Bang tries to catch it, but he misses and it makes the hoop. Monstars: 66 Tune Squad: 60 Roger gets possession of the ball, dribbling it as the Monstars run up to him one by one. He dodges every move they make on him, causing them to fall down and he passes it to Sylvester, giving him the chance to score. He jumps up, slam dunking the ball hard into the hoop. Monstars: 68 Tune Squad: 62 Swackhammer: (Getting angry and furious, eyes turning red) Dang! Daffy: (Paints a paint brush red and goes behind Pound) Oh, this will be good. He marks red paint on Pound's shorts. He points at his shorts for the crowd and they all laugh at this. Then the black bull, who is in the stands, sees the red painted shorts and everyone in the stands all look at him as the bullring fanfare comes on. He snorts angrily as his eyes turn really red. He jumps off the stands and into the court, running to Pound with his horns ready to ram his butt. Roger and Sylvester jump out of the way as Daffy moves out of the way too. Pound feels something's not right and he turns his head to see the bull coming at him with the horns down. The bull then hits Pound's butt and Pound screams in pain as he goes flying above the air, howling in pain. Crowd: Ole! Zach: (Picks up the ball and heads for the hoop) Come and get me, boys! (Slam dunks the ball hard and scores) Gotcha! Tweety is flying around and he gets surrounded by the Monstars. Bang: Ok, birdie. Tweety: Uh, oh. (Sees the Monstars about to hurt him) Kii... The Monstars all gasp and then Tweety starts hitting them, one by one. He punches Pound and Bupkus first, and then Bang. He twisted Blanko's head, bit Pound's ear, making him yell in pain. He grabs Bupkus' hair and rips it off. He kicks Bang's chin, making him fall on the floor, giving Elmer a chance to score. Elmer jumps in the air, like Sam does and he slam dunks the ball in the hoop. The crowd and the team cheers loudly. Sam: Yes! Davey: All right! Swackhammer: (Has enough) Time out! Monstars: 68 Tune Squad: 66 Swackhammer walks down the stands and goes to the court. Marvin blows the whistle, trying to tell him not go out there. Swackhammer: (Grabs him) Shut up, you little bug. Get away from me. (Throws him away) Powwow. Our heroes and the team head to their bench, laughing and giving each other high-fives. Davey and Hannah are happy. Hannah gives Davey a kiss on the cheek and he smiles at her and she smiles back. Sam: All right, guys. We're right back in this game. Come on, now. Let's play some tough defense. Zach: Yeah! We can do it! Speedy: All right! We're catching up to them, man! Mrs. Brisby: Of course! (Hugs Fievel) Davey: I told you we would. Swackhammer: (To the Monstars) Why didn't you get those two? (Points at Sam and Davey) Bupkus: (To Sam) He's an individual playing golf. (To Davey) And that guy's a golf player too. Nawt: Yeah, boss, they're both actors too. Swackhammer: Looks like basketball players to me. Blanko: Yeah, me, too. Swackhammer: They're the ones I want for Moron Mountain. Sam and Davey overhear everything and they have enough. That creep hurt Jackson and Zach and it's time they give this guy a lesson. Both: HEY! Swackhammer: (Hears them and turns around to see them, who are accompanied with Bugs, and Hannah) Are you talking to me? Sam: Yes, we're talking to you. Davey: You want a piece of us? Come and get it! Bupkus: Uh, oh. Swackhammer: (Chuckles) (Walks to them) What did you both have in mind? Sam: What about we raise the stakes a little bit? Swackhammer: Hmm... (Smokes from his cigar) Interesting. Sam: If we win, you give my friends their talent back. Davey: And I want to add something else in the deal. Swackhammer: And what is that? Davey: We heard that Sam is your hostage. And if we win, you have to set him free and let us have him. Swackhammer: Ok, but what if we win? They both think for a moment. They look at their friends and they have made their decision. Sam: If you win? Swackhammer: Uh-huh. Davey: (Growls) You get us both. The Tunes, the rest of the heroes and the crowd all gasp in horror. The Monstars laugh at this. Sam and Davey are gonna give themselves up if the team loses, so they can save the Tunes. Pound: Good deal, boss. Jackson, Hannah and Zach: Sam! Davey! No! (Hug him together) Bugs: Eh, doc, you think that's a good idea? (Gets his mouth covered by Sam's hand) Swackhammer takes his cigar and blows smoke in the air and shows them images of them being on Moron Mountain. Swackhammer: You'll both be our star attraction. You'll greet the customers all day... and play two-on-two with them... and you'll always lose. They both imagine what that will be like up there for the rest of their lives. They look at each other and back Swackhammer, who is smirking. Swackhammer: Do we have a deal? Sam: (Holds his hand out) Deal. Swackhammer smirks and shakes his hand and they both go back to their teams. Davey and his friends and Bugs follow him. Monstars: All right! Zach: Wait a minute! I don't believe this! I mean, a long while ago, you said you wanted the Looney Tunes, Swackhammer! And now you want Davey and Sam! Swackhammer: That's before I saw them play in the game, boy! Hannah: Davey, please, don't do this! Davey: Don't worry about it. We can beat them. Bugs: I don't think you should've done that, doc. Sam: We have faith in our team. Davey: And when we do win, Sam's free. Sam: (Looks at him) Really? Davey: Yeah, and you'll get to stay with our friends. Sam smiles with excitement and he gives Davey a high-five and he gives him a guy-hug. Back the Monstars' side, Swackhammer looks at them. Swackhammer: CRUSH 'EM![Chapter 19] Back on the court, Marvin blows the whistle and the ball gets passed to Wile E runs down the court, dribbling the ball. Then Bang, Nawt and Pound charge at him. Pound: Defeating time, boys! Wile E's eyes widen big and he gets hit hard. Wile E's body breaks to pieces. His arms and legs land on the floor and one of his arms holds up a sign that says, \"Ouch!\". Porky looks around and Bang and Bupkus crush him with their fists, making him flat. Sylvester has the ball and he dribbles it to the hoop, but Pound steps on him. Zach has the ball. He tries get past Pound and Bupkus, but then Pound hits Zach back. Elmer tries to score, but Bupkus elbows him down to the floor. Foghorn runs to the hoop with the ball, but Bupkus hits him with the back of his fist, Nawt kicks Taz and Bupkus uses Tweety as a golf ball and uses Foghorn as a golf club. Bupkus: Fore! He hits him screaming as he flies in the air. Hey lands hard next the bench where Granny, Zach, Hannah, Roger, Taz, and Sylvester look down on them with horrible and shocked looks on their faces. Daffy looks behind him and he whines in fear as he sees Bupkus behind him and he smashes him with his hand. He lifts up his hand to see him stuck to his hand and he comes out all dizzy. Daffy: (Dizzy and goofy) But mommy, I don't want to go to school today. Daffy gets off Bupkus's hand and goes on his head. Daffy: I want to stay home and bake cookies with you. He hugs his face and he pulls them to get him off his face, but as he pulls him off, he managed to get off, but now his face is all messed up and misplaced. Lola goes and helps Davey help on his feet and they look around to see Zach with the ball. Little did they know, Pound is behind them, climbing upon the hoop, grinning and chuckling. Pound: This is gonna be fun. Hannah: (Screaming) DAVEY! Roger: Lola, no! Sam: Davey, watch out! Tanya: Lola, behind you! Bugs: Lola, Davey, heads up! Davey and Lola turn around and they see Pound about to crush them. Pound: Belly Flop! The crowd all gasp and the team watch in horror. Zach runs to save him, but he knows he won't make it. Davey and Lola could only watch, but Bugs and Sam push them out of the way and they get crushed instead. Davey and Lola roll around and they get up and they both gasp as they see Bugs and Sam's hands sticking out of Pound's side. Lola: Oh, my, Bugs! Bugs! Davey: SAM! Davey, Lola, Hannah, Zach run to Pound down the court to check on them. Pound: Are these your men? He chuckles as he gets off of Bugs and Sam and they are both crushed. They are twisting and shaking in pain and they are flat. They become unflat, but Sam can't move. Lola runs to Bugs as Davey, Zach and Hannah to Sam. Lola: (To Bugs) Are you okay? Bugs: Me? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Are you okay? Lola: Oh, Bugs, thank you. Bugs: Aw, it was nothing. Lola: That was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. She kisses him on the lips and then walks away, leaving Bugs in his love awe. Davey and the others check on Sam, who is out cold. Davey: Oh no. Sam! Please! Don't be dead! Wake up! Hannah: Sam! Say something! Open your eyes! Zach: Sam, say something! Please! Sam slowly opens his eyes. Davey and Hannah lift Sam up a bit and they hug him. Sam groans as he gets a flashback. Flashback It shows Swackhammer stealing a baby from a family in a hometown. He gets in his ship and he is getting to take off. The family runs out, trying to save the baby. The little boy is crying, yelling for his baby brother. It is Noah, when he was young. Young Noah: Stop! Sam! No! Wait! Get back here, you idiot! Sam's Dad: Sam! Come back! Swackhammer: (Laughing) He's no longer yours now! Bye-bye! Swackhammer takes off and the ship flies in the air. The baby cries for his family, reaching out for them. Noah reaches for him too. Swackhammer looks at him, chuckling. He picks him up and looks at him. Swackhammer: You're mine now... Sam Sturtridge. Flashback ends Sam gasped as he shook, as tears fall down his eyes. Davey and Hannah see him and look at his face. Davey: Sam? Are you all right? Hannah: (Concerned) Sam, what's the matter? Are you okay? Sam: (Looks at them) I need to tell you guys something, in private. Please. Davey: Okay. Zach! Call time out. Sam and Hannah and I need to talk about something in private. Zach: Time out! The time out buzzer goes off and we go to the bench, where all of the tunes are in pain and hurt bad. Wile E has casts on three of his limbs and he holds up a sign that says, \"Extreme pain!\". Yosemite smokes as he moans in pain. Sylvester has a big cast around his body as his head is down to his you know what. Speedy is in bad shape and great pain. Elmer is in a straight jacket and he is all dizzy after being hit by Bupkus. He keeps saying \"Monstars\" over and over. Foghorn is turned into a turkey with an I.V next to him. Granny has a cast around her neck and she is in a wheelchair. Taz is out cold and Witch Hazel is giving him electric pads to revive him. She shocks him and he twitches around and there are words on his chest that say, \"Eat at Joe's\". And last, we see Tweety laying next to a machine that says, \"Acme Iron Lung\". Meanwhile, Sam runs with Hannah and Davey back to the locker room and he talks to them. Sam: Guys, I remember what happened. My life. I never told you what happened. Davey: Really? What is it? Sam: I remember my life and name. It's Sam Sturtridge. Hannah: What? Your last name is Sturtridge? Davey: Really? Does that mean you're Noah's younger brother? Sam: How did you know about my brother?! Did he tell you all about me? Hannah: Yes. He told us you were kidnapped by someone and he never saw you again. Davey: That's why he joined our team. He told me he wanted to find you and bring you back home, so you and him can be a family again. Sam: Well, where is he? Is he here with you guys? Hannah and Davey look at each other sadly. They didn't want to tell him the news, but he had the right to know. Davey: Sam, I didn't tell you because while you were away, there was a incident months ago in Los Angeles. We were saving Roger, his wife Jessica and Toontown from a madman named Judge Doom, who was a half-man half-toon psychopath. During the fight... (Sighs sadly) We thought your brother was killed in the process, but he was struck down cold and he's being hospitalized. Sam's eyes widen and he starts to shake. Tears fall from his eyes and he starts to cry. Hannah walks to him and hugs him. Hannah: I'm so sorry, Sam. We really are. Sam: (Crying) I really never got a chance to know him. I mean, I just wish I did! It's been like, ten years! Davey: On the night he lost consciousness, he wrote something about you and I want you to hear it. (Pulls out Noah's journal and reads a page) May 7. Dear Diary... Voice of Noah: Today is Sam's tenth birthday. On the night he disappeared, I promised I would find him and bring him back home, so I can welcome him to the team. And now... I'm worried, that I may never get the chance. Tonight might be my last night. I went out to adventures with my friends to do amazing things, but now, I would trade it all, just to find you and get to know you and watch grow up to be like me. If anything happens to me tonight in Mr. Acme's factory, I will find you in spirit and I'll always watch over you. Happy birthday, Sam. I love you. Your big brother, Noah. P.S., Davey, if you find this, and if you find Sam for me, read this to him for me. Davey closes the journal and he walks to Sam and he hugs him too and Sam hugs back, his face on Davey's shoulder as he continues crying. Davey: It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Come on, let it out. Sam: I wish I met him otherwise! I never saw him all my life! (Crying on Davey's shoulder) Hannah: Sam, listen to us. I know you're having a hard time now, but you've got us too. We'll be like your family now, like we were like his. Davey: Yes, and no matter what, we will always be there for you and we'll always be your friends. Sam sniffles as he hugs them both, and they leave the locker room and went back on the court to join the game. Sam now knows of his past life and learns about his brother. He only wishes he got to know his brother. But now, he's got new friends and they will protect him.[Chapter 20] Back on the court, all of the tunes and heroes, except for Daffy, Bugs, Lola, Davey, Hannah and Sam were injured bad. Zach paces around, looking at them and Jackson. Davey tells Zach he and Hannah need to help tend the injured. Zach: (To himself) Okay, think, Zach, think. we need a fifth player. Daffy: Hey, coach. Listen. You got anymore of that secret stuff? I think it's starting to wear off. Zach: It didn't wear off. It was just water. You guys have the special stuff inside of you all along. Davey: He's right. So did me and my friends, Daffy. Daffy: Yeah. Yeah, I knew that. But listen, you got anymore? Lola: Yeah. I'll take a double. Porky: Er, can I have some, too? Zach just rolls his eyes and he looks around and sees Jackson, praying to be picked as the fifth player. Zach has no choice. Zach: Jackson? Jackson: Yeah? Uh, me? Zach: You go in at center. Just guard the big guy, okay? Jackson: (Takes off his jacket for his jersey) Guard him? Guard him? I'll smother him! I'll be all over him like a cheap suit! I'll be on him like stick on rice! I tell you, he's going down! The game resumes and Marvin passes the ball to Lola and she passes it to Zach. He dribbles the ball and the Monstars all charge him at him and surround him, trying to take the ball from him. Jackson runs to position and holds his arms up. Jackson: Zach, over here. Over here. Over here. I'm open, I'm open! Look, give me the ball! Zach passes the ball to Jackson and he catches it. He attempts to go off toward the hoop, but before he could get past the three point line, he gets crushed by Bang, then Bupkus, Blanko and Pound. The ball slips out of Jackson's hands as it flies to the hoop and scores three points. Sam: Yes! Davey: All right! Hannah: Yeah! Yes! The crowd cheers loudly for the three pointer. Even one of the Nerdlucks is cheering. Swackhammer was not too trilled about it as he slams his hand down on him. Then they all get off Jackson and he is flat like a pancake. All of the teammates groan and moan for Jackson as he lays down flat on the floor. A dinging is heard as Spike and Chester with a bed come out and they approach Jackson. Chester: Let's get him out of here! They stop near Jackson and Chester puts a hose in Jackson's mouth and pump him up like a balloon, trying to pump him back to his normal size. He flies above the air. Spike chuckles as he grabs the hose and he pulls it and it comes out of his mouth and he makes a farting noise as he deflates and flies through the cieling. Lola: Eww! Nerdlucks: Ew... Ach! Blech! Pepe: (closes his nose with a clothespin) Oh my... Jackson lands on the bed, back to his normal self. The crowd applauds at this as Zach watches them take Jackson away to be taken care of. Zach: (To Bugs) How'd he do that? Bugs: Aw, anybody could do that, doc. Even you. Watch this. (Grabs Daffy's neck) Daffy: (Choking) Watch what? (Gets his neck stretched) See? No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land. Zach follows Daffy's gaze and he sees the time. They only have ten seconds left to score two more points to go. Zach: Ten seconds to go? Thanks for telling me... Doc. Marvin: (Walking to them) I hate to be the bearer of bed news, your airness, but if you don't find a fifth player, your team will forfeit the game. Zach: Forfeit? Marvin: Precisely, air altitude. Zach: No way. We'll find someone. ?: (Fanfare) Da da da da da da da da da! They all turn around and they see our heroes' favorite actor, Bill Murray. He is wearing a Tune Squad jersey and the crowd cheers loudly. Swackhammer: (Jumps from his seat) Whoa, whoa, whoa! I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture! Bill: Hey! Perhaps I could be of some assistance. Zach: (Points at Bill) That's our fifth guy. (Sees Bill walking to them and gives him a high-five) Good job, Bill. Now you get to live up your dream. Let's go. All right, we need to score 2 points. Bill: All right. Here's how I see it. Duck! Daffy: Yes? Bill: You kick it in to the girl bunny down in the post. You dish it back out to the guy bunny. Lola: Got it. Bill: You swing it to Zach over here. You go to the hole and Zach: Hey, Bill, we're on defense! Bugs: Oh, yeah. Bill: Whoa, ho ho, I don't play defense. Zach: How typical. Bill: All right. You're gonna have to listen to Zach on this, guys. Listen Zach: Somebody steal the ball, get it to Sam, and he'll score before the time runs out. Bill: Don't lose that confidence. Okay! Paws and Wings in here! All right! They all head back on the court and the crowd cheer for the team, giving them spirit. Monstars: 77 Tune Squad: 76 Bill: (Walking) This is why I was born. I thrive on pressure. Daffy: (Tapping on Bill's shorts) Excuse me. Uh, Bill: Yo, yo. Easy on the trousers, Daff. Easy, Daffy: Pardon me. Um, Mr. Murray, something's really been bugging me. Bill: Yeah? Daffy: Just how did you get here anyway? Bill: Producer's a friend of mine. Just had a teamster come and drop me off, you know. Daffy: Uh-huh. Well, that's how it goes. Davey: Lola, you're gonna set this one. Knock them good. Lola: Thanks, Davey. They're watching you. Davey: Don't worry about me. Sam: Bugs, be careful not to let them get to you. If they try to get the ball, intercept the passes and send them to our men. Bugs: Thanks, doc. I'm ready now. Sam: Zach? Zach: (Tunrs around) Yeah? Sam: (Takes a deep breath): I'd like to sub in for you. I'm over what happened earlier. Zach: Okay. (Taps in on the back) Go. (Runs back to the bench) Roger: (Runs to Sam) Good luck to you, buddy. If you get the posession and get us the lead, you'll be free. Sam: Thanks, buddy. I'm gonna do this! (Pats Roger on the back) Bill: (Sees Pound by Lola) Hey, you see this kind of Chunky fellow over here? Daffy: (Sees Pound) Uh-huh. Bill then whispers in Daffy's ear, giving him an idea and he likes it. Daffy: Ooh. Ooh, that's good. Oh, yes. Bill: All right. Let's do it. You're the duck. They get ready for the next play. And whoever score wins the game. Will it be the Monstars or the Tune Squad?[Chapter 21] It is the Monstars's ball and Marvin gives the ball to Bupkus. Marvin: Now, let's all play fair. Here. Bupkus takes the ball and hits Marvin with his elbow. He gets ready to pass it. Bill: Yo, spaceman, don't choke now. Come on. Come on, come on. As Bupkus gets ready, Daffy puts on a football helmet and acts like a bullet. Daffy: It's gut-check time! Bupkus passes the ball to Pound and Daffy launches at him. As Pound catches the ball, Daffy hits his chest hard and makes him drop the ball. Bang and Blanko watch the ball dribble to Bill. Bill: This must be mine. (Picks it up and dribbles) Whoo-hoo! This belongs to me. As he dribbles it, Pound pushes Daffy out of his chest and holds it in pain. He sees Bill with the ball, with Nawt blocking him. Bill: I'm going this way. I'm going left. I'm going left. (Tricks Nawt and passes the ball to Sam) Whoa-ho-ho! Don't ever trust an earthling! Sam dribbles the ball, trying to get past Nawt. He sees the time and they only have eight seconds. Lola: Come on! Sam throws the ball to Lola and she dribbles it before getting surrounded by Bang and Blanko. Bang: Get the rabbit! Get the girl! Daffy: (Jumping up and down) Come on! Come on! I'm open. Lola then passes it to Daffy. But before he could get it, Bupkus hits him with his hand and reaches for the ball. Bupkus: That's mine! Bugs: (Gets in front of Bupkus and grabs the ball with his ears and throws to Bill) Not today! Bupkus: Hey! Bill: (Catches it and shows it to Blanko) Blanko: Bring it on, dude! Bill: (Gets out of the way and trips Blanko) Oopsy-daisy. Whoo-hoo. Bill then passes it to Sam and he heads for the hoop, but Pound comes in and charges at him. Pound: You're mine. But before Pound could get him, he slips and falls on the floor. Sam then jumps on Pound's head, hurting him. He climbs up to Pound's butt and then jumps and flies to the hoop as the crowd roars. Pound turns around and sees Sam flying. Bill: Sam, I'm open! (Sees Sam in the air) Never mind. Time slows down as Sam flies to the hoop, ready to score. Bugs and cheers for him. But then, Bang and Bupkus roar and they jump up and grab Sam to stop him. Sam remembers what he saw Bugs say. He's in Looney Tune Land and he can do anything. He then stretch his arm out with the ball and like Daffy's neck, his arm is stretching out too. He reaches for the hoop and he is preparing the final dunk. Bupkus and Bang see this and they know they're all gonna lose and then, Sam slam dunks the ball into the hoop and the horn blows. The crowd cheers wildly. Swackhammer's eyes widen and he yells in rage. Tune Squad: 78 Monstars: 77 All of the tunes and our heroes cheer and laugh at their big victory of the game. Davey and Hannah hugs each other and Bugs and Lola hug each other too. Bill laughs in joy and he runs to Sam, who lets go of the hoop and lands on his feet. Hubey: THE TUNES WIN! Davey: Yes! Zach: Yeah! Bill: We did it, man! Roger: Yay! They all run up to each to each other and they give each other high-fives and hugs. Sam hugs his new friends. He is now free from slavery. Sam: Oh, thank you! Thank you, guys! Thank you! Thank you! I'm free! Zach: (Laughs) You're free, Sam! Hannah: Yeah, and you're one of us now. Davey: Welcome to the team, buddy. Pepe Le Pew leaps onto Granny's shoulder and kisses her on the cheek. She looks at him in surprise. As they all celebrate their victory, Sam and Bill walk away to talk in private. Sam: That was a nice pass, Bill. Bill: That was a great stretch for the basket, too. Sam: You know, you really got some skills. You might be able to play in your free time. Bill: Thanks, Sam. I'll probably quote you on that. But i'm gonna take this opportunity to retire from the game. Sam: No. Come on. Bill: No! No! I'm gonna retire right now, and that's all there is to it. I'm gonna go out on top, undefeated and untied. That's the way it's gonna be. You go on ahead and celebrate with your friends and teammates. Sam: No, come and celebrate with us. Bill: I'd like to, but I have to ice down my knees right away, ok? They're starting to go. Sam: All right. Good-bye, man. Bill: All right. See ya. (Walks away) Sam: (Gets a little thinking about Bill's knees) Are you sure? Give me a hug. Bill: (Runs back and they hug each other) Yes! Definitely sure. Definitely. (Hopping) Mrs. Brisby: Uh, Sam? Speedy: You might want to get over here! Fievel: Yeah, we've got a situation here! Sam walks to the team and sees Swackhammer yelling in rage at his team. Swackhammer: Losers! All: Sorry. Swackhammer: Choke artists! All: Sorry again. Swackhammer: Wait until I get you back on Moron Mountain. (Stomps on Bupkus's foot, making him yell in pain) All right. The party's over. (To the Tunes and Sam) Get in the spaceship. Davey: No! We won, the tunes stay, Sam stays too and you have to let us have him! That was the deal! And you can't treat these fellas like this! Swackhammer: I can do anything I want to them! I'm their boss and they failed me! And Sam's my slave and I'm not giving him to you. Sam: (Enraged with tears) Not anymore! Either way, I'm never going back to Moron Mountain! Never! And I'm no one's slave, no matter what! The deal is complete, you lost, so go with it! I never liked you from the very beginning, when you stole me from my family! (Stamps his foot in rage) Tony: Yeah! You tell him, kid! Zach: (To the Monstars) Why you take it from this guy? Bupkus: Because he's bigger. Pound: He's bigger... Bang: Than we used... to be. All: Wait a minute. They finally realize they're bigger than their boss and he should be giving them respect, not anger. Swackhammer feels something is not right as he looks at them nervous. Swackhammer: What are you doing? They all reach for him and they grab him and drag him through the court. Swackhammer: Hey! Wait! What are you doing? Wait! Let go! They ignore him as the Tunes and our heroes watch in interest. Then they put their own boss in a rocket. Bugs and Wile E smile at this. And then the rocket takes off and it heads for the ceiling as the Monstars wave good-bye to him. Outside the arena, the rocket blasts through the ceiling and it flies into space. Swackhammer screams as he zooms fast and heads for the moon. And a little black smoke is seen on the moon, meaning he landed. Back in the arena, the crowd and the Tunes cheer. Sam and our heroes look at the Monstars. Zach: Had it in you all the time, didn't you? Sam: Just like me, huh? The Monstars just blushed and shrug like they say, \" Aw, shucks.\" Davey also knows what else has to be done. Davey: One thing, though. Pass me the ball, Bugs. (Gets the ball and gives it to Sam) Here you go. Sam: You have give my long lost friends their talent back. All: Whoops. Pound: (Sadly) Do we have to? Davey: Yeah. It was part of the deal. If we win, you have to give their talent back. And we won. Go ahead, touch the ball. They all look at each other. They know they can't keep the talents forever. They know what needs to be done. They all put their hands on the ball. But as they touch, they began to shake and twitch as the ball starts to sparkle and glow. Our heroes back away, except Davey. The talent begins to leave their bodies and into the ball. And then they start to shrink down to their original sizes. Their jerseys, shorts and shoes are still the same size. They all pop out and back to their normal selves. Bupkus: That was so much fun. Bang: I feel so insignificant. Pound: (Looks at his jersey) My clothes don't fit. Nawt: What a trip. Blanko: Heh heh. I'm up for another one. Pound: Can we ask you favor, Mr. Bunny? We don't wanna go back to Moron Mountain. Bang: We hate it up there. Nawt: It stinks. (Thumbs down) Blanko: Um, I was thinking, could we stay here with you? All: (Showing cute and friendly teeth and faces) Please? Daffy: (Not falling for it) Oh, brother. Bugs: Eh, I don't know if you guys are looney enough. Bang: Looney enough? Then they put on costumes of the Looney Tunes and they act like them and being funny and looney. They hum the Looney Tune theme song. Davey and Zach laugh at this sight. Nawt then shoots them and their eyeballs are all that's left. Then Jackson shows up with Sam's basketball bag. Jackson: Sam! Sam! Do you know what time it is? Porky: (Looks at his watches) Er, 7:15, er, 7:15, er, quarter past seven. Jackson: Exactly. You've got a night at the park in 5 minutes. Sam: Okay, good. (He gives Jackson the ball) Take this. Jackson: (Looks at the ball) Is it safe? Sam: Yeah. Put it in my bag. Jackson takes the ball and puts it in the bag as Sam, Zach and Davey talk to the Tunes. Sam: I really enjoyed playing with you guys. You have a lot of, uh... All: Huh? Sam: A lot of, um... All: Yes? Sam: Well, whatever it is, you have a lot of it. They all feel great and happy that Sam said those words to them. Davey: Yeah, you all did real great tonight. You made Looney Tune Land proud, even made us proud of you guys. All: Aw, thank you, Davey. Davey smiled as the Tunes felt good about his speech to them. Some of the toons like Daffy, Wile, Sniffles or Sylvester smiled back. Before leaving, our heroes each gave the Tunes a hug, kiss or handshake goodbye. I will cross the ocean for you I will go and bring you the moon Jackson shook hands rapidly with Taz and high fived Porky. Sam was given a head noggin by Foghorn then a pat on the back by Wile E, and shook hands with Marvin. Zach patted Tweety on the head and winked goodbye to Road Runner. I will be your hero, your strength Anything you need Hannah hugged Taz and Wile E goodbye, causing them to have hearts in their eyes. Davey shook hands with Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd and Beaky Buzzard. Pepe kissed Hannah's hand. Speedy gave high fives to Mrs. Brisby and Justin. Fievel, Tanya and Tony hugged Sniffles goodbye. I will be the sun in your sky I will light your way for all time Granny ruffled Sam's hair as Witch Hazel did Davey's. Sam hugged Lola and kissed her on the cheek, making her giggle. Davey bumped fists with Daffy and Zach, Bugs shook hands with Roger and hugged Sam, Hannah and Jackson. A heartfelt experience to remember. I promise you For you I will After saying their goodbyes, Jackson, Zach, Roger and Hannah run out to finally go home, everyone is feeling proud of themselves. Davey: (smiles) Come on, Sam. We'll find you a way out. (Walks away) Sam: Gotta go. (Follows him with his friends, stops and turns to Bugs) Bugs? Bugs: Eh, Sam? Sam: Stay out of trouble. Bugs: (Looks at Lola) You know I will. Lola: (Giggles) Bugs: Come here! Bugs grabs Lola and he kisses her on the lips. She was surprised, but kisses him back. He ends the kiss and she whoops in joy and excitement. She pulls down a different scene down so she and Bugs can continue kissing. It is late at night on Morello Avenue. They are in Davey's car and they drive on. Sam: You know what? To be honest with you, I'm kind of relieved. The conditions back on Moron Mountain were awful. Davey: Yeah. I agree. If it were me, I'd escape with the other guests for good. Sam: So, where are we headed to? Davey: We're going to the courtyard downtown. We're gonna have some time outside after that one big game. Sam: Yeah. Quite a big one. The car comes to a screeching halt near the city hall, where the two friends get out of the car, put some quarters into the meter, and go over to the fountain, where Zach, Hannah, Roger, his wife Jessica, Fievel, Tony, Justin, Mrs. Brisby and Jackson are sitting around and talking to each other. Davey and Sam sit down with them. Days later, they remember there is one more thing they need to do. In a gym, the five young players were practicing, but they're still bad without their talent. Dillon: Guys... we suck. (Sits down) Luke: Yeah, man. My grandmother plays better than I do. Suraj: At least you guys are still tall. I'm nothing now. I'm just another short guy. Dillon: You got that right. Luke: That's the only thing you got right. As they talk, the door opens and they turn to see Davey, Jackson and our heroes coming in. Nikos: Who's that? Dillon: I don't know. Zach: Been getting your butts kicked, haven't you? Davey: We know how that feels, boys. Dillon: It's Davey and his new friends. They all get up and go to them as they approach them too. Nikos: Hey, man. What you doing here? Zach: Don't be embarrassed. Just face it. You guys stink. Luke: Come on, Zach. Lighten up, man. Zach: I know. Davey: And you all want your games back, huh? What little games you had to begin with. Jake: Hey, bro, it's hard enough as it is. Dillon: Come on, give us a break. Zach: I'm gonna regret this. Davey, give me the ball. Davey bends down and unzips the bag, showing the ball that has the talents inside it. It is still glowing. They all look at it in awe as Zach takes the ball. Suraj: Look like something from Star Trek. Zach: Touch it. Jake: No way, Jose. Zach: Nikos, you want your talent back? You don't have any other choice. Just touch it. Nikos: I don't know, dude. Davey: Ok. Then you're gonna walk around with a bad game for the rest of your career. Touch the ball. Jake: Be careful, Nikos. They all look at the ball and thought about this. Jake: We've tried everything else. Nikos then moves his arm to the ball. He slowly reaches for it and he touches it. He exhales, knowing nothing bad happened. Zach: Come on, Dillon. Touch it. Hannah: The rest of you guys. Just touch it. They all reach out for the ball and after they touch it, the ball shakes and their talents went back inside their bodies. They move their hands away from the ball as Zach, Jackson and our heroes smile at this. Luke: Oh, man! Dillon: What was that? Zach passes the ball to Suraj and he catches it. He was surprised at this. Suraj: Hey. Hey, I caught it! (Dribbling the ball and doing the rock) Nikos: Hey, look at Suraj handle the rock. Handle it, baby! Suraj: I can handle that rock again! (Passes the ball to Luke) Luke: That's the old Suraj I know. Nikos: (To Luke) Yeah, get height now. (Watches Luke slam dunk the ball into the hoop) Yeah! Luke: It gave me my powers back! Dillon: (Takes the ball) That wasn't bad. Let me show you something. Luke: Let me see. (Sees Dillon slam dunk too) Whoo! Nikos: The round-mound is back. (Takes the ball) You wanna see something? He slam dunks too and he laughs. Our heroes, Zach and Jackson smile at this and they take their leave as Jake slam dunks too. They turn to see Davey and his friends leaving. At the Chicago Bulls stadium, there is a big game. Announcer on P.A.: The Chicago Bulls welcome back... Michael... Jordan! Michael is walking through the crowd of cameramen and reports. The crowd in the stands cheers loudly for him. A bull balloon is floating in the air and it has a sign below that says, \"Welcome back, Michael\". The lights turn on to reveal the basketball court. It is time for the game. In the stands, Bill Murray and Larry Bird watch the game. Bill feels down right now. Larry notices this. Larry: What's the matter, Bill? Bill: Larry, that could have been me. Larry: Will you get off that kick? It's over. It's done with. You can't play. Bill: (Thinks for a moment) Ok. (Voice breaking) Let's go, Bulls! On another stand, Davey and his friends, Sam and Jessica are watching the game too. Sam is struck with tears because he is free. Davey: You okay there, buddy? Sam: Yes, I'm fine. (sniffles) I have come a long way from Moron Mountain and it was not a swell life. I'm glad I'm finally free, but I have nowhere to stay. Fievel: Well, you did come from very far away. That's true. Davey: I can see that. Now that you're with us, would you like to stay with us at my home? Sam: I'd like that. I won't let you down. Hannah: We know you won't, Sam. You're gonna be like your brother. Sam: (Smiles) Yeah. Roger: This has been a great adventure for us, guys. Jessica: Yeah, it has. I'm so proud of you, Roger. (Kisses his cheek) And now, let's sit back and enjoy the game. Davey: Yeah, you're right. Zach: Let's watch the game. Justin: Let's go, Bulls! Our heroes laugh as they watch the game. The Bulls steal the ball and pass it to Michael. He dribbles it down the court and runs to the hoop and slam dunks the ball. The crowd cheers loudly as Davey and Sam embrace in a tight hug like brothers. ","Summary":" Summer, 2006 It is nighttime. A shooting star flies by and the moon is showing. The scene zooms dow"},{"Movie":"Space Jam","Title":"Space Jam: Resonance","Author":"Empress Oriana","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8347769","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I did say I would make a sequel, and here it is! I'm so happy to know that the first story was a great one and landed as a success. Had you all at the edge, didn't it? Well, wait no more. Here's the premier of the sequel to 'Revisioned', now known as 'Resonance'. Enjoy! \"Now class, can anyone tell me the meaning of this quote by this author?\" Our professor Mr. Johnson ranted on during lecture about literature and it's greatest writers. Hale was in the class next to mine, so unfortunately, we couldn't do much to ease each others suffering when it comes down to terms of boring teachers and lame lectures. \" Psst. Hey! Kari! \" I looked over to my left, and saw my one of my best friends, Nada, wave over her hand in front of my face. 'Guess I must have fallen asleep with my eyes open again...' \"You fell asleep with your eyes open again. You know you'll get caught one of these days if you keep that up!\" She chided quietly, not wanting our teacher to hear our conversation. Nada and I met each other when I entered middle school. I confided in her with just about anything, but so much like I do with my brother. Out of everyone I met and became friends with (and that goes for Hale too), Nada's the only one who didn't think that mine and my brother's odd trips to the mini golf course were weird or childish. Nada has long black hair and the most brilliant green eyes I have ever seen. She's about an inch taller than me, considering that I'm now 5'5. Her skin is pretty fair, while mine has a slight tan, making it a small shade darker than hers. Just as I'm talented in singing, she's super talented in dancing! I asked her if she could teach me the ropes to dancing, but every time I tried to match her movements, I flail like a noodle. In all honesty, she's definitely someone I could depend on. She's also the only friend I know who dared to walk into our house and help with babysitting even! I yawned silently, my eyes getting glossy from the reaction. \"Sorry. This class is just so boring . I can't help it!\" She shook her head, but gave me a hearty grin. \"Hey, it's Thursday. Tomorrow is a day off, so no school! Besides, didn't you say that your parents are going to be out of town for a week?\" I raised my head, now interested in our current topic. \"Well, yeah. But it's only for a week. Dad's got some important business to attend to somewhere in Maine, and mom is going with him. Why?\" She smiled innocently. \"Oh, just wondering..\" I narrowed my eyes at her playfully. \"Liar.\" \"Ladies, would you please save your small talk for after class?\" Professor Johnson said sternly. He gave us a serious look before turning back to his lecture. I glanced over at Nada, who was looking up at the ceiling while whistling silently. I lowered my head and whispered. \" What are you getting at? You know you can't hide things from me.\" She knelt her head down as well and pleaded. \" Can I come over for the weekend? Pretty please? \" I looked up to see that Mr. Johnson finished his lecture and was asking everyone for any questions they may have. I looked at her and nodded. \"Fine. I'll ask my folks, and as always, I'm sure they'll be cool with it.\" The bell immediately rang, ending the last class of the entire school day. She squealed and jumped over to give me a hug. \"Thank you!\" I returned the embrace while grinning happily. We gathered our books and material and rushed out of the classroom. Hale was standing in the hall waiting for me. \"Hey! What took ya so long, Kari?\" He growled, obviously agitated. \"Is it Mrs. Shuck again?\" I said giving him a dreadful look. He nodded his head. \"The woman talks more than this one here.\" He pointed at Nada, who gave him a scowl. \"I do not talk that much!\" Nada retorted. She punched Hale playfully on the arm. Hale grunted, looking down at his watch. \"So what's the plan, sis?\" He glanced down at me with that look he always gave me since we were kids. \"The plan is that we go home and drop off our things, then see what mom and dad have to say. Then hopefully, we can go back to the mini golf course and look around again.\" Nada gave us a strange look, but she was already used to that routine. \"Again? Kari, you and Hale keep going there like it's a daily ritual. Just what is it that you're looking for over there?\" I brushed some of my short auburn hair behind my ear. \"Just something.. We've been looking for it since we were kids. There's always still hope.\" Hale nodded his head, a sad look written all over his features. Nada glanced back and forth between me and Hale. In final defeat, she shook her head. \"I'll never understand you guys and this weird obsession about visiting the mini golf course.\" I gave her a small smile. \"Perhaps someday you will.\" She gave me an odd look. \"Huh?\" I shook my head, not really expecting her to understand what Hale and I have been through. \"It's nothing.\" I said quietly. 'It's something..' We arrived to our house after we walked Nada to her house. She didn't live far from us and we all lived close to the high school anyways, so the walk never lasted long. I called our mom when we arrived at her house and asked if it was alright for her to stay over the weekend; she complied saying it was alright so long we had her parents permission as well. She asked her mom and dad and the both of them were fine with the plans. We agreed for her to come by tomorrow morning with her stuff. As we walked up to our house, we noticed our dad's SUV parked in the front and the trunk propped open with suitcases. We also noticed that some of them weren't our mothers or fathers' suitcases. Hale and I raised our brows at one another as we approached the front of the house. The front door was wide open as we saw, to our surprise, Aunt Jackie fumbling about with our mom, looking unsure and frantic. 'oh boy... here we go...' \"Hey, mom. Hey, Aunt Jackie. What's going on?\" Hale glanced at the both of them, curious as to what the commotion was all about. \"Oh, Hale! Kari! Thank goodness. I'm sorry that I came here without any notice, but you see..\" Our mom intervened, putting a hand on Aunt Jackie's shoulder to calm her down. \"Aunt Jackie had some trouble going down in on of her restaurant branches in Maine, so she's coming with us. I asked her to come here to watch over you two, but with this, it changes everything. So, I must ask you two if you could do the favor of watching Marie while we're away. It may be longer than a week depending on how your father's errand goes, as well as your aunt's.\" \"Oh, okay. That's not a problem.\" I assured them both. Marie is our two year old cousin, and a cute one at that! She's still learning her words, but has made a lot of progress. She has a bob hairstyle and chestnut brown eyes. Aunt Jackie didn't think that having a kid would change her wild lifestyle, but on the contrary it did.. and for the better. \"Marie is in her play-pin in the living room. Please take good care of her.\" Aunt Jackie asked with worry. \"Don't worry. We will. Just leave her to us!\" Hale grinned a toothy grin. Aunt Jackie smiled at him and then gave us both hugs and kisses good bye. Mom did the same and approached us both with the same loving gesture. \"We'll try not to be gone for long. Tell Nada hi and be careful when she gets here, okay?\" I nodded. \"Yes, mama. I'll be sure to tell her.\" Both she and our aunt walked out of the house and headed to the car. Moments later we heard our dad rush into the house from the garage door. \"Oh, hey kids!\" He quickly gave us hugs and kisses too. \"Take care and guard the house. Don't let any strangers in!\" \"But dad, Nada's coming over!\" I called out to him as he was about to head out the door. He turned around and smiled. \"Oh, well she's alright. Just no one else though, am I clear?\" We nodded our heads as he closed and locked the front door. After a couple minutes we heard the SUV's engine start up and then driving away. They were gone. Hale made sure the door was securely locked while I made my way into our living room. Inside a small purple play-pin was Marie, who was already fast asleep and sucking on her thumb. I carefully picked up her sleeping form and took her upstairs. I went into one of our guest bedrooms at the end of the hall, where we had a spare crib whenever Aunt Jackie came to visit and stay for a whole weekend or so. I gently placed Marie inside her crib, minding her tiny head. 'She looks so adorable when she's asleep!' I quietly left the room, leaving the door ajar in case of anything. Hale was inside his bedroom, spinning his basketball above his head. I leaned against his bedroom door frame. \"What are thinking about, Hale? I haven't seen you like this since we were kids.\" He stopped spinning the ball and looked over at me, his eyes filled with some sorrow. \"Do you think we'll ever be able to go back there again? It's been six years already, Kari.\" I gave him a sour look, scaring him a little. \"I have faith that we will, Hale. I'm not giving up, not yet.\" I glanced down at my rose engraved bracelet that I received from Nawt that very night. \"I can't give up!\" He noticed the item on my wrist and smiled wryly. \"Nawt gave that to you, didn't he?\" I looked up at him, completely taken aback. \"So now you ask about it? Why didn't you before? You've known I had this for the past six years.\" He sat up on his bed and chuckled at me, scratching the back of his head. \"I didn't bother. I knew he was the one who gave that to you. He was very fond of you, after all. He liked you.\" I tilted my head inn confusion and sighed. \"I know. I just wish I knew more of what I truly felt.. no.. what we truly felt, back then.\" He got up. \"We?\" \"Me and Nawt.\" I bit my lip, trying to hold back useless tears. Hale walked over to me and placed his right hand on my left shoulder. \"We'll get back there. Like you said, we must have faith, and once we do get there, you can then find out.\" I raised my head as he gave me a warm and loving smile; the smile an older sibling would give to comfort their younger sibling. We made our way downstairs and started to prepare some dinner for ourselves. I prepared some fruit salad with almonds and pecans along with a roll of bread for the both of us and some milk. Hearing Marie wailing from upstairs, I took her spill proof cup that I filled with apple juice earlier and a small bowl of fruit salad and rushed up the stairs. After a while, I got her into her pajamas and she went straight to sleep again. For a toddler, Marie sure does sleep a lot. I went to my bedroom and got myself ready for a shower. After a good ten minutes of blissful showering, I got out and dressed myself into a comfortable pair of thin gray sweatpants and a pink camouflage tank top. I used them as pajamas since they were the most comfortable articles of clothes that I had available. I walked into the hall and right into Hale's room, which was right across from mine. He already took his shower and was staring out into nothing from his window. He wore a teal and navy shirt and black and gray camouflage pants. Hearing me enter his room, he turned around and greeted me with a smile. \"Since we didn't get the chance to check the golf course today, want to try again tomorrow?\" I asked him gently. He shook his head. \"Nada will be here tomorrow morning. Plus, we got Marie to take care of, and asking her to watch Marie for us is out of the question.\" I nodded in understanding, not surprised that he practically read that question from my mind off the bat. \"Want to go to the park, instead? Just for fun. It's not like we'll find anything there anyways.\" I knew just trying again only to have his hopes get shut down, as well as mine, was taking quite a toll on us. So I figured that trying to relax for once would be a nice change. He glanced up at the ceiling momentarily, then nodded his head with a smile. \"Aright. The park it is. But Marie and Nada are coming with us, just so you know!\" I laughed. \"Okay, okay! You win. We'll take Marie and Nada with us. I'm sure they'll enjoy it too.\" He grinned at me before letting out a loud and long yawn. \"Well, it's getting late. I think it's about time we get some sleep if we want to get to the park early enough.\" \"Sounds like a plan. We need some relaxation anyways.\" He nodded his head vigorously, his eyes getting wide at the comment. I giggled and bade him good night. He reciprocated the motion and closed his door gently behind me as soon as I made way into my room. I walked over and crawled into my bed. Looking over on my night table, I smiled as my eyes rested on my bracelet. Little did I know that tomorrow was going to be something completely different.. and completely beyond my most hopeful wishes. Waking up in the morning was a long start. For one, I woke up a little too early than usual. Feeling unusually motivated and with a strong feeling of assurance, I jumped into the shower and cleaned myself up. I then got out and dressed into my attire, which consisted of a rose pink top that's sewed on top of a black top and a red sleeveless hoodie with roll up jean capris and brown Greek sandals that went up a bit above my ankles. I grabbed my bracelet and clasped it on my wrist, completing the assemblage of my wardrobe. I then walked out of my room and went to check on Marie. To my surprise, she was wide awake and looked over at me with an adorable smile. \"Kar-kar!\" she chirped happily, her tiny hands extended out in front of her. I went over and picked her up. I got out a cute yellow tunic just for her and a pair of magenta shorts with white socks and her white sneakers. After dressing her up, I took her small brush and gently ran it down her hair, making her coo in the process. Once that task was over, I picked her up and we made our way down the hall and down the stairs. On our way, we nearly bumped into Hale, who just walked out of his room, dressed in his clothes. He wore a black shirt with a teal and white sweater on top and dark blue jean pants, along with his pair of white Nike's. His hair never changed from its natural spiky style, and kept it as so. \"Whoa! You guys are up early! What's the hurry?\" He gave me and the little girl in my arms a surprised look. I smiled at him gracefully. \"Good morning to you too, Hale. Isn't that right, Marie?\" Marie giggled and pointed a tiny finger at him. \"Hay!\" My brother furrowed his brows. \"No, but close. It's 'Hale'. You have to pronounce the 'L'.\" She pouted and replied. \"Hay!\" Shaking his head, he glanced over to me. \"You taught her that.\" I shook my head. \"She still calls me 'Kar-kar'. So we're on the same boat.\" Glancing down at his watch, he noticed it was 7:43 already. \"Well, let's go eat something. Knowing Nada, she'll be here pretty soon.\" Hale grimaced, remembering the last time she came over early in the morning and ate breakfast with us. He had to wash an extra two plates. We all went down and got something to eat. I prepared some scrambled eggs with sausage links and oatmeal with cinnamon for all of us, with a helping of banana juice. After we ate, we washed our dishes and brushed our teeth, with me helping to brush Marie's. Hearing the doorbell ringing, we rinsed our mouths and went downstairs. Having our cell phones, house keys and the baby bag in hand, we walked towards the front door. Hale opened it up and saw Nada right there on the front porch with a duffel bag full of her clothes and items for the weekend. \"Hey you two! Are we going somewhere?\" I nodded, holding Marie in my arms. \"Yep, we're gonna go to the park for a while. You want to tag along?\" Nada nodded her head with a bright smile. \"Sure! Where can I put my bag though?\" I moved my head to my right. \"Leave it on one of the sofas for now. We'll take it upstairs when we get back.\" She nodded , and went inside to leave her bag on the larger sofa. She was wearing blue jean shorts and an emerald green top with a white cardigan and her pair of sky blue flip flops with white Hawaiian flowers printed on them. Her long black hair was tied up in a high ponytail. \"Hey there, Marie! You remember me?\" She cooed towards the toddler, prodding her finger into the tiny hand. Marie giggled and cooed with glee. \"Na!\" Nada looked over at me with surprise. \"She talks! She almost said my name! The last time I saw her, she was just babbling.\" Hale called out to us from the sidewalk. \"Hey! Let's get to the park already!\" She shook her head, muttering \"Yeesh, chill Phil. We're coming.\" I locked the door and put away my keys in my fanny pack and made my way with Nada, Marie and Hale towards the park.[Chapter 2] BAM! Chapter 2 for 'Resonance' is here! I'm so pepped up for this, aren't you? I own nothing except The Rodgers siblings and their two year old cousin Marie. Nada Sampson belongs rightfully to MonstarzGirl. She asked to have her OC brought in here, and I happily obliged. Third Person POV: It was another bright and cheerful day in Looney Tune Land, although it couldn't be said the same for some of the inhabitants. The Monstars, after getting on good terms with the Tunes, were allowed to take residence in the wondrous cartoon world, and have even improved on their own with basketball, despite on some occasions that they would mess up on some moves. Almost everyone managed to move on with their lives, except for one particular individual. Nawt was heartbroken when they left Kari and Hale after the game and the kids' talent show performance. Ever since then, he was waiting for when they would meet again. Days, weeks, months, then eventually years dwindled away between them. Now that it has been six years, he felt close to giving up hope. The rest of his friends, including the Tunes, began to worry about him and his sanity. Bugs tried to get Daffy to come and help him find the kids since they haven't showed up, but every time they tried to go above ground, they got chased by dogs, almost got caught by security guards that patrol certain areas, or the kids weren't even home when they tried their house. Daffy was at his last feather, and nearly threw a fit the last time Bugs tried to convince him that they should give it another go. \"Forget it, hare brain! Let's face it! Those two aren't coming back! It's been six years and nothing! They haven't showed their faces, wrote a letter, zilch!\" The mallard was just as distraught as anyone would be. He, too, grew very fond of the kids. Bugs figured that he may be right, but refused to give up that easily. So one day, on a particular Friday, he walked up to Yosemite Sam, who was sitting by the lake talking with Foghorn Leghorn and Wile Coyote to pass the time. \"Eh, hey there, docs! What ya up to?\" The tiny cowboy looked up at him with a scowl. \"What is it, ya mangy vermin?\" Foghorn shook his head at Yosemite's harsh comment. \"I say now, that's not polite there, Yosemite. Hello there, Bugs. We're just sitting by this here lake and are just chatting away.\" The gray hare smiled. \"I see. Say, could you guys do me a favor? Well, actually, it would be doing everyone here a favor, if you could.\" This peaked interest in the three characters. \"What ya need, rabbit?\" Yosemite spoke up, raising his brow. Bugs took out a carrot and began to munch on it. \"I would like you to see if you can real in Kari and Hale down here again like ya did six years back.\" Yosemite felt his eyes bug out of his sockets. Foghorn looked mildly surprised by the request and Wile just the same, only more shocked and with a small tint of hope and happiness at the thought of it. \"But Bugs, it's been years since I done that! How am I to guarantee that I'll get 'em again?\" The small cowboy looked bewildered at the notion. It's not that he didn't mind doing the favor, but his rope brought them in by chance when he last reeled the two into their world. He can't be sure if it will do the same again a second time. \"Well, then we might as well take our chances. I know you guys have been missing those two terribly just as much as I have and everyone else here. And when I mean by everyone else, you know who I meant.\" Yosemite nodded his head. \"'Yeah, I know. That red feller who is with his alien friends. Poor guy; he's still takin' it hard?\" Bugs nodded his head. Wile's ears drooped at the statement in agreement. Foghorn felt sad at the sentiment as well. \"But, uh, isn't, I say, isn't he mostly fond of the little gal?\" Bugs munched on the remains of his carrot. \"Yeah, but he also misses Hale too. Just please try to bring them in again. I honestly don't know how much longer Nawt can maintain his sanity on this issue.\" Glancing at one another, the three came to a mutual agreement and nodded their heads at Bugs. Yosemite pulled out his lasso. \"Alright, rabbit. I'll try reeling 'em in again. But I can't guarantee ya if I don't.\" Bugs nodded. \"Just find me when you do, doc. I'm gonna go check and see how our alien friends are holding up.\" Bugs started to make his way over to the direction of the Monstars domain, which used to be the abandoned house they used previously as a hiding place when they first arrived to the planet six years prior. Yosemite turned his attention to his lasso as he began tying the knot, forming it into a loop and getting it ready so he can haul in his intended targets. Foghorn couldn't help but look at him with a concerned look. \"I say son, do you know just what you're doing?\" Wile tiled his head to the side, as if he was asking the same question. Yosemite gave them both a dirty look. \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.. I just hope my rope will pull through for us and grab the right people.\" The cowboy turned his head towards Wile. \"Alright, you coyote. I need you to go up there, and if you see them, lure 'em so I can catch 'em.\" Wile stood upright in a salute, then turned heel and rushed off. With one last check on his rope, he threw it up over his head, swung it around a couple times above him, and tossed it far into the high blue sky. Marie began to fuss in Kari's arms. Nada looked over at the tiny toddler and tried to soothe her. \"There, there Marie. We're almost to the park.\" After another three minutes of walking the teens finally arrived to their destination. \"Here we are, ladies!\" Hale grinned at his female companions. Kari smiled brightly as they stepped foot on the grass, leading straight to the park. Nada grinned from ear to ear. Feeling her arms getting sore, Kari let out a sigh. \"I'm going to put Marie down for a minute. My arms are killing me.\" Setting down the small girl onto the grass, Kari stretched out her arms to relieve some pressure from their previous posture. Marie giggled and began slowly waddling her way towards the park. Hale chuckled as he watched his little cousin enjoying herself by merely walking towards the park. He turned to face his sister. \"You know, coming here wasn't such a bad idea after all. Great idea you had, Kari. Thanks.\" Kari glanced up at him and smiled warmly. \"Anytime. It looked like you needed it.\" Marie kept waddling, nearly tumbling every couple steps or so. To her, it seemed like she was getting closer to her destination... until she heard something. It sounded like leaves rustling and it was coming from near the trees. Turning her tiny head, she caught sight of something from near the bushes. She walked a little closer to the direction of the bushes and saw something that looked like... a dog. The dog looked panicked and dove back into the bushes. The tiny girl became fascinated at the sight and tried to run as fast as her little legs could take her in the direction of where she saw the dog. Nada glanced over and saw Marie going away from the direction of the park. \"Hey! Marie! The park is in the other direction!\" She turned towards Hale and Kari with panic. \"Kari! Hale! Marie is going near the woods!\" In full alert, the siblings turned their heads towards the direction of the woods and saw their baby cousin waddling towards the thick woods. \"Marie, no!\" Kari cried out. Hale called out to her as well. \"Don't Marie!\" The three teens started to run after the toddler without hesitation. Marie didn't pay attention to the older children as she continued to make her way to the bushes. Pushing away through the bushes, she saw the dog crawling into a rabbit hole. Marie started to make her way towards the hole, until she felt someone tugging at her and picking her up. Nada held on to the little squirming two year old. \"Marie! You know you shouldn't run off like that!\" Kari and Hale finally caught up and chided the young girl lightly. \"Marie, you shouldn't have done that! You could have been seriously hurt!\" Hale nodded his head breathlessly. \"Yeah, Marie. If you're going to wander somewhere, at least have one of us with you!\" Marie turned and squirmed, almost letting free of Nada's hold. \"What is it, Marie?\" She let the small toddler down on the ground gently. The tiny girl waddled to the hole and pointed, \"doggy!\" They all gave her a dubious look. Kari sighed and shook her head. \"Come now, Marie. There's no way a dog can fit in a rabbit hole... wait.\" A thought struck Kari in question to Marie's one worded outburst. \"What kind of dog did you see?\" Marie waddled a little closer to the hole and knelt down, pointing her finger down towards it. Right when the tyke pointed her finger down close enough to the hole's entrance, a rope came out and lassoed around her wrist. Kari immediately reacted and so did Hale and Nada. \"MARIE!\" They all jumped in to grab the little girl and all in one go, they were pulled into the hole.[Chapter 3] I am utterly exhausted from my constant running around today! So here I am, in front of my mini pink laptop, ready to present to you Chapter 3. I own the Rodgers siblings and Marie. Nada belongs entirely to MonstarzGirl. On with the show! Phew! It was like deja vu all over again as we all were flying down the hole. Hale, Nada and I were the only ones screaming our mouths out while Marie was in a fit of giggles and laughter. 'Is Marie the only one who's actually enjoying this?' All of a sudden, we made a harsh turn inside the hole and kept flying at an extremely high velocity. Nada began to panic like no tomorrow. \"Ahh! Someone please STOP THIS THING!\" I could have sworn she had tears nearly flowing our of her eyes like jet streams. Marie kept giggling at the high speed we were going through. Clearly this toddler stole her mother's wild side at the very moment she came into this world! Hale and I were the only ones who had the same idea as to where we were going, despite that we too, were screaming our voices dry. \"Kari! Look up ahead!\" He hollered. I glanced up and saw the familiar Warner Brothers logo right in front of us. I screwed my eyes shut as I waited for the impact. \"NO WAY!\" \"NOT AGAIN!\" cried Hale as he braced himself. I felt him cringing closer towards me as we clung onto Marie. \"WE'RE GONNA DIE!\" Nada screamed, now close to losing it. She clung close to us as we made contact with the giant logo. \"WARNA BROTHA!\" squealed Marie with delight as we finally went through the logo in a suction like movement. '.. You said it, Marie!' We all found ourselves being pulled into a bright blue sky with lingering clouds among us. Looking at one another, Hale and I immediately shared the same reaction as we saw ourselves now aiming down towards the solid ground below us. \"Kari, hold on tight to Marie!\" Hale bellowed, knowing the landing wasn't going to be easy or a pleasant one. \"Hang on tight to me, Marie!\" I gripped the tiny tot close to my body as we prepared for impact. Nada's eyes grew in panic. \"We're gonna hit the ground! It was nice knowing you guys!\" She shut her eyes, our bodies going rigid. Then I heard a loud whirring sound, like something coming this way. I felt and heard it whiz by us; it was something sharp and silver. The next thing I knew, the rope was severed and we were sent flying in different directions. I held on to Marie, shielding her body with mine as I fell into a tick pile of leaves. Opening my eyes and looking down at our soft landing, a sigh of relief escaped my lips. Marie giggled and cooed, crying \"Agin, Agin!\" I heard a loud splash and looked over to see Nada land into a large body of water, supposedly the lake of Looney Tune Land. Hale landed adjacent from us and got caught in between two tree branches. Luckily, he wasn't hurt. Hale grabbed one of the branches and pushed himself up then swung down and off from the lowest branch safely. \"Kari! Are you and Marie okay?\" He ran up to us and offered me his hand. I gladly took it and slid down the pile of leaves with Marie safely tucked in one arm. \"Hey! Wha-what about- ack- me?\" We turned our sight over to Nada as she wadded out of the Lake, drenched from head to toe. \"Are you okay, Nada? You're not hurt, are you?\" I went over to her to check for any injuries. Thankfully there were none. \"I'm fine. Just soaked.\" She grimaced as she squeezed some water out of her shirt. Her ponytail was clinging against her skin, some strands of hair clinging on to her face as well. \"Well, what do ya know? I guess it worked!\" A loud, western voice boasted from behind us. We all turned our heads to see none other than Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, and Wile Coyote looking down at us from the small hill near the lake. \"Golly! It's them! You did it, I say, you did it Sam!\" Foghorn slapped Yosemite hard across the back in glee. Wile was smiling a large smile at us, obviously happy to see me and Hale again. The three Tunes made their way down the hill, in a hurry to greet us. We all gave bewildered looks at them, with Hale and I mainly fighting our inner selves for a reaction that would be appropriate: happiness, sadness, or both. 'Dammit! Both, I say!' Knocking myself out of my stupor, I gave Marie over to Nada as I rushed to greet our friends. Hale seemed to have snapped into his senses and rushed over as well. \"Oh my goodness! I can't believe it! We're back!\" I cried in sheer happiness. \"Hale, it's them!\" Hale nodded his head feverently, unable to believe it either. We hugged the three Tunes with tears of joy. Yosemite gave me and Hale the biggest hugs he could muster, and Foghorn and Wile hugged each of us separately. Nada stood there in complete shock and awe. \"Those.. those are.. It can't be.. no way..\" Marie fussed as she wailed, pointing at Wile. \"Doggy!\" Hale and I looked at Wile with surprise. \"So that's who she saw!\" Hale looked at me with realization. I nodded in correspondence. Wile looked at the small fussing girl nervously. I shook my head and let out a laugh. \"Relax, Wile. Marie won't hurt you. She just thought you were a stray dog.\" Nada looked over at us, then the Tunes, then down to Marie in her arms. \"Oh, I forgot. This is our friend, Nada Sampson. Just call her Nada. The little girl in her arms is our two year old cousin, Marie.\" Hale said with a slight chuckle. The three Tunes waved at her and the tot in friendly greeting. Nada waved back shyly, a small flush of embarrassment rising up to her cheeks. \"Hi.\" Yosemite walked up to me and my brother. \"You two sure have grown over these past six years. Speaking of which, why didn't y'all come and bother to visit us?\" He gave us a disappointing and hurtful look. Hale frowned slightly. \"We tried to! Kari and I looked everywhere for an entrance back here, but we found none. We tried the mini golf course many times since that was where you caught us last time.\" I nodded in agreement. \"It's true. We thought you guys forgot about us after some time..\" The three of them gave us shocked looks. \"Forget about ya? Hon, we thought you forgot about us ! We waited for days, weeks, months, and nothin' from the both of y'all! We missed you two kids terribly!\" Foghorn cried with exasperation and sadness. Now it was our turn to look shocked and hurt. \"We're sorry. But we didn't forget about you. We couldn't ! You guys are our friends and we missed you too.\" I gave them a sad smile. Wile shook his head, pulling up a sign saying 'it's not your fault.' Yosemite nodded. \"Wile's right. You kids didn't know how to get back here, and we should have known better about that. Bugs was right about fetching you guys earlier..\" \"Wait! Bugs is here too?\" I gave them a wild look. \"Where is he?\" Hale looked around in all directions frantically. Wile grinned in amusement at our childish reactions. Yosemite chuckled. \"Whoa there, partners! He left to get some friends of yours; ones we know that miss you two more than anyone here in Looney Tune Land.\" I felt my heart skip a few beats and heat rising to my cheeks, knowing exactly who he's referring to. 'The Monstars... and that means Nawt!' \"Well, then what are we waiting for?\" Nada said from behind us, already reading off the look of excitement and happiness off our faces. \"Hold up! I have an idea.\" Hale grinned with a cleverly raised brow, the wheels in his head turning like crazy. \"What, I say, what do you have in mind, son?\" Foghorn asked, interested in Hale's sudden remark. Wile raised an interested brow and Yosemite gave him all his attention, as well as Nada and I. My brother gave a devious smirk. \"Why don't two of you take us to the gym while the other guy goes and gathers the rest of the gang, Monstars and Tunes, and bring 'em over? That would be a surprise for everyone, wouldn't you say?\" Yosemite smiled. \"Sounds like a great idea there, Hale. Actually, even better! Why don't we take you guys over to the outside stage?\" I gave a curious look at Sam. \"The outside stage?\" Wile face-palmed at Yosemite's lack for better vocabulary. Foghorn shook his head. \"He means the amphitheater, hon. We know you two perform well in terms of music, so why not fix up a tune and play it while we gather everyone over? It'll bring a big enough ruse for everyone to hear and come see. Sounds reasonable?\" Hale and I could crush Foghorn in a bear hug right now, which we did. \"I take that as a yes?\" He choked out. Yosemite grinned with satisfaction. \"All right, then it's settled. I'll go and fetch them mangy varmints, while Wile and Leghorn here take y'all to the stage. Better prep yourselves real good now, ya hear? Don't wanna get anyone's hopes up for nothin'!\" We nodded in understanding, our excitement hardly contained. Satisfied with our answer, Sam turned around and started making his way towards Looney Tune Town to gather everyone up. With Wile leading the way, we started making our own journey toward the amphitheater. Foghorn passed a towel over to Nada so she could dry herself off while we were on our way. Hale took Marie into his arms and sat her up on his shoulders, giving her the high view of the entire area. She clapped and giggled with glee, enjoying every minute of being here. 'I know exactly how you feel, Marie. I'm super happy to be here too, and so is Hale without a doubt.' A thought occurred to me and I decided to ask Foghorn about it. \"Hey, Foghorn?\" He looked up at me. \"What is it, hon?\" I gave him a curious glance. \"What exactly cut through Yosemite's rope when he caught us?\" He raised both his brows at this news. \"What? Something cut through the rope when he rounded y'all up? Hmm. That's strange. I can't say, hon. Did you see what it was that cut it?\" I shook my head in slight defeat. \"No. It went by too quickly. But I wanted to know if you knew what it was, by any chance.\" He shook his head, looking upset for being unable to help. \"Sorry, hon. I didn't see it. Maybe you can ask Yosemite when we see him again with the rest of the town. He might be of more help than I am.\" I gave a slight nod, still unable to shake the ominous feeling that I got when that blade cut through Sam's lasso. For some reason, I think that weapon wasn't aiming for the rope at all... Scolding myself for thinking such horrible thoughts, I pushed the memory of that moment out of my mind, now focusing on what to perform for a number alongside Hale for the Tunes.[Chapter 4] Well, I got chapter 4 here. Enjoy as I take a nap... I don't own Warner Brothers stuff, Nada Sampson, or 'Pins and Needles' by The Birthday Massacre, and 'Forever', which is also by them. Only Kari, Hale, and Marie. Listen to those songs while reading their performance parts. It'll make more sense. Third Person POV: Bugs made his way to the Monstars' house. After the night of Hale and Kari's performance, Bugs and the rest of the Looney Tunes reconstructed the abandoned house into an actual home. The entire place was now a large mansion with bonus guest bedrooms and additional rooms added, including a gaming room, outdoor swimming pool, a personal sauna, large gourmet kitchen and much more. The Monstars couldn't believe the expense that the Tunes pulled out just for them, but Bugs assured them that it was no biggie. Making his way to the front door, his extra sensitive ears were able to pick up Pound's shouting from inside the home. Knocking with caution, hoping that he wasn't interrupting anything important, Bugs waited. In a matter of a minute, Blanko opened the door and looked down, greeting the gray hare with a friendly grin. \"Hey there, Bugs. We just finished breakfast, so come on in.\" Nodding with a \"Thanks.\", the rabbit made himself comfortable inside their domain. \"Say, uh, where's the other guys, doc?\" Blanko rubbed the back of his neck, averting his eyes for a moment. Bugs raised a brow. \"Is something wrong?\" Blanko nodded. \"Nawt's been a bit more depressed than usual. He didn't eat for the past three days and Pound's trying to get him down here to eat at least something.\" Bugs gave a worried look and pointed over towards upstairs. \"Is he up there?\" Blanko sighed. \"Yeah. Pound, Bupkus and Bang are up there trying to get him out of his room. He refuses to open the door.\" Now Bugs gave a seriously worried look. \"Is he..?\" Blanko gave him a scared look and mildly shook his head. \"No way! He responds and we checked. It's just that he doesn't acknowledge us as often and mostly shuts himself in his room. I checked on him once; he mostly lays down on his bed and stares at the ceiling with a sad look.\" Blanko sighed in defeat, looking down at the hare helplessly. \"You gotta help us, Bugs. Can you knock some sense into him? We're worried that he might just get worse.\" Bugs gave his usual grin. \"No problem, doc. Lead the way.\" Blanko motioned for the hare to follow him up the stairs. They walked up and turned left into the long and broad corridor. Making a right, they went down to the end of the hall, where they saw the other three Monstars in front of their friend's door. Bupkus looked over at the sound of footsteps and greeted the hare with a surprised look. \"Hey, Bugs! Mind if you help us? Nawt won't open his door.\" He couldn't help but raise a curious brow at the large alien. \"Is he alive?\" Bang growled. \"Oh he is alive, alright. He just won't open the stupid door! I can hear him throw the basketball around the room for peat's sake!\" Pound shook his head, obviously getting agitated. \"I'm telling ya, if he doesn't open this door, I'm gonna bust it down!\" Bugs raised his hands, motioning for him to calm down. \"Take it easy, Pound. Let me try to talk to him.\" The four Monstars moved so as to give the bunny some space near the door. Bugs cleared his throat and spoke up against the door. \"Hey Nawt, it's Bugs. Listen, the guys and I are worried sick about ya. But we can't help ya if you don't let us. Why don't you open the door and we can talk things over? I may not be much of help, but-\" He was cut off as the door cracked open, Nawt looking down at the hare, his eyes almost bloodshot from possibly crying and lack of sleep. \"You look like hell, man.\" Bang said with wide eyes, now slightly scared for his friend's sanity and well being. \"Come on out here, Nawt. It's not healthy to stay up in here all day.\" Bugs coaxed. Looking down at the floor for a moment, he nodded his head in compliance. The red Monstar opened the door and got out of the room. Although his clothes weren't haggard, his features read a different story. \"Now let's go downstairs and get a little something for ya. You know as well as I that Kari wouldn't want to see you like this.\" Nawt raised his head at the mention of her name. He nodded weakly. \"Yeah. You're right. She'd probably be mad at me if she saw me like this.\" He closed his eyes bitterly at the memory of when they left back to Looney Tune Land. Bugs nodded his head in sentiment. Before anyone could usher a word, a loud banging echoed from downstairs. They all raced down the hall and looked down below. The banging was coming from the front door. \"Let's see who that is, shall we?\" Bugs inquired, hoping he was right about who it may be. The Monstars glanced among one another with wonder, sans Nawt who was too wrapped up in his own emotional turmoil to even care. Bang approached the door and was surprised to see who it was. Bugs took a peek from the green alien's side and nearly fell at the sight and collision of who it was. Falling backwards from the sudden tackle, Bugs wheezed out, \"Daffy? What on earth-?\" Daffy jumped off of Bugs, happiness dancing in his eyes like nothing before. \"All of you have to come quickly! Yosemite hasth something to show all of us, including you guysth!\" The mallard pointed at the Monstars. \"What's going on?\" Blanko asked raising a brow. Pound crossed his arms. \"What do you mean he has something to show us?\" Daffy shook his head. \"No time to explain! He saysth that we have to be there and that it was a huge surprise!\" Bugs got up, wiping off the dirt from his fur. \"And exactly where is \"there\", doc?\" Daffy gave him a sour look. \"The amphitheater, of course!\" Bupkus gave a bewildered look. \"What's at the amphitheater?\" The Monstars glanced around one another, Nawt raising a brow at the sudden turn of events. Daffy face palmed himself hard and gave them all a frustrated look. \"All I know, is that we have to be there, and he did say something about a surprise; something involving a special performance. That's all I know! Now can we go?\" All of them gawked at the duck, especially Nawt. \"A special performance?\" Bugs had a feeling about it, a really good feeling. \"For the last time, YES! Now let's get a move on before we miss it!\" Without waiting, Daffy took off in the direction leading to the amphitheater. Bugs turned around and faced the Monstars with a knowing grin. \"So what do ya say, docs? Shall we all go and join them on this 'big surprise'?\" Taking one final look at each other, the Monstars grinned and nodded in agreement. Nawt gave a small smile. \"Let's go then. I'm kinda curious to know what this surprise really is.\" Without warning, Bupkus picked up Bugs and threw him over his shoulder. \"Let's vamoose!\" They all took off at high speed in the same direction Daffy went. Bugs thought silently to himself; a grin playing on his features. 'I guess Sam pulled through, after all...' Normal POV: \"So how did it go with those NBA players? Did ya, I say, did ya give them their talents back?\" Foghorn asked us as we were now at the amphitheater. Hale got the drums set and the keyboards. I tuned the guitar, making sure they strummed at the right pitches. Finishing the touches on the guitar, I glanced up and gave him a smile. \"Of course. We found them at a gym near the theater a few days after the talent show. They looked miserable when we saw them.\" Hale frowned at the memory. \"Yeah, they looked really pathetic, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. We played a round or two of basketball with them afterward and that was it.\" Foghorn gazed up at the sky as in thought. \"Oh, I see.\" Wile was sitting down playing peek-a-boo with Marie. The two year old giggled in delight. Nada walked up to the two of us curiously. \"Mind if I can help with something?\" she asked hopefully. I gave her a warm smile and nodded. \"Sure! You can play the keyboards, right?\" She nodded her head. \"I took some lessons. I'm sure I can handle it.\" It was true. Hale taught Nada the ropes to the keyboards a a token of gratitude for her teaching me how to dance, as well as Hale himself on some occasions. Hale got up and stretched his back. \"Okay; everything's all set to go! Now we just need a number.\" Foghorn gave him a questionable look. \"A number? Like between 1 and 10?\" I giggled and shook my head. \"No, silly! A song. Hale was referring to a song for our surprise performance.. and I think I know one. Hale, come here a sec! You too, Nada!\" I brought them closer and whispered in their ears what song I had in mind. Hale nodded his head. \"Sounds good to me, and it works well, especially for the welcoming committee.\" Nada smiled, going along with the idea. \"Sure! Let's go for it!\" Wile, Marie, and Foghorn gave interested looks towards the teens. \"What song you have in mind?\" I gave him a tiny sad smile. \"Something Hale and I worked on as a school and home project. You'll hear what we mean in a moment.\" The three of us ready with our assigned instruments: Nada with the keyboards and synthesizers (yes, she learned that too), Hale at the drums, and I with the guitar which I learned from Hale, we glanced at one another with confidence. Hale and I had mics, since the both of us knew what the lyrics were and he agreed to take on the chorus line with me. \"Ready, sis?\" Hale gave me a grin. \"Ready, bro.\" I replied. This was like deja vu all over again, with the exception of Nada's present being. Taking a deep breath, we steadied ourselves... and we started the music. The rest of the Tunes showed up the moment we started up the music, including Bugs, Daffy, and the Monstars.. even Nawt. We didn't notice them at the moment as we were focusing on our playing. \" Once a night, the bedroom light Leads out from inside my window Eyes white, I keep out of sight This city's just not pretty like it used to be It's always a nightmare, it's never a dream The promise we made to kill the days between They live in the heartbeat and sleep till the light is gone Hale and I kicked up the chorus, our hearts unknowingly beating at the same time we said each line. It's been so long Feels like pins and needles in my heart So long I can feel it tearing me apart I strummed hard on the guitar, the adrenaline rushing as I knew Hale was beating those drums and Nada tuning in perfectly with the synthesizer. I summoned my voice up to the words as they left my mouth with powerful emotion. To the bed, the left unsaid Crawl in from outside my window Hands red and cold as the dead A pity they're not pretty like they used to be It's always a nightmare, never a dream The promise we made to kill the days between They live in the heartbeat and sleep till the light is gone The chorus struck up again, every ounce of feeling and emotion flowing right through. It's been so long Feels like pins and needles in my heart So long I can feel it tearing me apart The music tuned down a bit, leaving Nada only playing melodically on the keys. I gazed up and saw nothing but a blurry crowd, knowing my emotions are having at me. I spoke up the second to last stanza, sadness evident as I sung out. It's never a whisper, it's always a scream The promise we made to kill the time between They live in a heartbeat and sleep till the light is gone It's been so long Feels like pins and needles in my heart So long I can feel it tearing me apart\" We played a little harder as we brought the song to a close, the struggling emotion felt with every fiber of the song itself. As the song came to an end, we heard only a couple seconds of silence until a loud roar came from the crowd before us. I glanced up and looked at Hale and Nada, giving another nod. Turning to the mic, I spoke up. \"We have one more number to perform for all of you guys. However, this one in particular is for someone I hold dear to me, and truth to be told... it's about how I felt the night after the talent show. I hope you will all appreciate it.\" I gave the signal to Nada as she danced her fingers across the keyboard, tuning up a beautiful melody. Giving it a moment for Hale to sync in with Nada's playing, I then took hold of the words from my heart; those feelings exactly from the night when the talent show ended, singing them out. \" Today is the first of our numbers We're never asleep Sometimes there's a voice when I close my eyes Sometimes I can't hear you speak Did you learn to take cover Or are you running away? And you see right through me This shouldn't last forever You're so close Now it's time to say goodbye I then strummed the guitar, smiling a bit. You wait for the sun in the morning I'm waiting for rain Sometimes you're too close when I close my eyes For now, you're quiet again The story is over You never wanted the same Did you learn to take cover Or are you running away? And you see right through me This shouldn't last forever You're so close Now it's time to say goodbye Talk to me This voice is the faintest I've heard in the longest time Now that it's time that you pretend You know I do Do you want to see this to the end? You know, you know I do And you see right through me this shouldn't last forever You're so close Now it's time to say goodbye Talk to me This voice is the faintest I've heard in the longest time\" We finished the song with it's bittersweet melody to the very end. I felt my eyes burning as they blurred my sight. I heard the cheers of the crowd, whistling, hooting, and even some crying. I tried to keep my composure at it's best, but to no avail. I started to break down, closing my eyes and letting the warm tears escape me. That's when I felt a pair of strong arms embrace me and my head resting on a strong, broad chest. Then a voice rumbled from deep within the figure holding me; a voice I longed to hear from for the past six years. \"It's okay. I'm here.\" Looking up, I gave in to my emotions completely as I saw Nawt looking down at me with silent tears of pure happiness streaming down his own countenance. I embraced him back, holding him close and afraid to let go for fear that he may disappear like those many times I dreamed of him being by my side only to wake to nothing but my pillow. He hushed me, stroking my back gently. \"Don't cry, sweetheart. I've been waiting too. Now the waiting's over... for both of us.\" 'It's real... this is all finally real. Thank you, God.' He hugged me with equal force. To confirm the reality, he lifted my face up gently by my chin to meet his gaze and joined his lips with mine.[Chapter 5] Oi vey. Chapter 5 is here. Now time to spread some action! I own Hale, Kari, and Marie. Yep. That's pretty much it. Nawt's POV: We rushed as quickly as we could to the amphitheater, with Bang carrying Bugs like a sack of potatoes. I had no idea what Daffy was really getting at, but it got me as he mentioned about a 'special performance'. I had my doubts, but for some odd reason, I felt as if this was something I had to see. It's like I was being called; my heart was being called. 'Kari..? Are you here?' Sensing that my intuition was right in more than one way, I kicked in the footwork I have developed on my own and ran even faster. She must be here. She has to be! Hearing loud music starting up from just beyond the hill we were arriving to, my pulse began to race even faster than before. As we all arrived to the top and onto the top of the amphitheater seating area, we all gaped in disbelief. I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing... at all . \"Well, would you look at that ? They're back! \" Bugs said happily. Pound had his jaw hanging at the sight. \"They are back!\" Bupkus rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't just seeing things and gawked at the figures below on stage. Bang, like always, was about to start the waterworks. \"I can't believe it's them!\" He held tight to his tears, not wanting to gush everywhere. Blanko stared completely stupefied. \"But.. they're older and bigger... and they look kinda different.\" Pound looked at Blanko with a sarcastic look. \"Nah, really? That's what happens when six years go by, Blanko. People age. Well, except us.\" Blanko shrugged. \"Just sayin'.\" I ignored them as I made my way down the steps and towards the stage. None of them seemed to have noticed me wandering further into the crowd and towards the stage. In all honesty, I didn't care about the rest of the Monstars at the moment. I didn't care about the Tunes, or anything else at that matter. Even seeing Hale up there on that stage along with that new female friend of theirs didn't interest me! My eyes, ears, and heart were set right on the woman behind the mic and holding the guitar. Yes, Kari is now technically a woman . 'She's not so little anymore. She's a woman now; no longer the tiny girl who was thought as a joke. But she's still the one saved me from my crushing death and from our servitude to Swackhammer. She's mine. My Kari..' I stepped up until I was standing a bit further from the front row seats and near the stage itself. The first song ended, as she looked up at the cheering crowd. She obviously couldn't see me from where I was standing, but before I could make a move closer, she spoke. \"We have one more number to perform for all of you guys. However, this one in particular is for someone I hold dear to me, and truth to be told... it's about how I felt the night after the talent show. I hope you will all appreciate it.\" My heart felt ten times more filled with joy and overwhelmed longing for her. I held steady as she commenced the next song, and as she soon spoke the words, that's when I also realized that Kari was suffering too. 'She was suffering just as much as I was... Oh, Kari..' Tears formed and began to leak from the corners of my eyes, streaming down my cheeks. If only I knew about how she was feeling this whole time. In a way, I felt like it was partially my fault. I had to make it up to her for sure. I had to let her know it's no longer some nightmare to wake from over and over again.. and truth be told, I needed the reality check just as badly. The second song then ended, the crowd drowning the silence with their loud roars and cries. I think I heard Bang wailing somewhere from far behind me, but I left that as it is. I glanced up to her; she started to break. I took a deep breath and began making my way up to the stage itself. 'No more tears.. for both of us. The wait is over.' I stood in front of her and brought my arms around her petite frame, not caring if her brother and her friend were watching; if anyone was watching for that matter. I brought her into a close embrace, her head resting on my chest. \"It's okay. I'm here.\" She gasped slightly and looked up at me, her large hazel eyes growing wide in disbelief. I gave her a smile of endearment, the tears streaming down both of our faces. She immediately wrapped her arms around me, holding on for dear life as if I was about to fade away from existence. I knew exactly how she felt and embraced her with equal force. I stroked her back gently, hushing her sobs. \"Don't cry, sweetheart. I've been waiting too. Now the waiting's over... for both of us.\" 'Finally.. after all this time.. I have her again. Never again will this happen.. EVER.' Unable to hold in my urges and happiness to have Kari back in my life again, I gently took her chin by my forefinger and thumb and tilted her head up so I can meet her gaze. We briefly looked into each others eyes, and the next thing I knew, I brought my lips down to hers in a loving kiss. She happily kissed back, her hands gripping on my jersey tightly. I felt like I was on cloud nine, for certain. In pure honesty and belief, with the higher power as our witness, we were both sharing our first kiss. In front of everyone, even in front of Hale. I hope he doesn't dare interrupt or break us apart at all; I don't care if he's Kari's older sibling, I will send him straight to hell if he even tries ... or anyone else for that matter! Call me selfish, I don't care; I missed my girl too damn much and this is too good to pass. After what seemed like an eternity of lip-locking, we finally broke apart for some air. She glanced up at me with a warm smile. That 1000 watt smile that sends shivers up my spine.. among other sensations. I grinned back at her, thanking every deity known out there for bringing this wonderful girl in front of me into my life. Kari then began to stifle a laugh. I raised a brow, then turned around when she pointed right behind me. All of my teammates: Pound, Bupkus, Bang and Blanko were boggling at us with their eyes almost the size of basketballs. I grinned at them cheekily. \"Problem?\" Pound opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it and just shook his head, muttering something under his breath. Bang grabbed a tissue from out of nowhere and blew his nose loudly like an elephant. Bupkus winked at us and gave a thumbs up, as if saying 'way to go, lovebirds!' Blanko smiled and nodded in approval, then moved his gaze over to our right. Kari and I glanced over and saw hers and Hale's friend blushing while looking back at Blanko with equally mild interest. Blanko shyly waved 'hi' to her and she reciprocated the motion. Kari and I then looked back at one another and we chuckled. We had the same thought cross our minds. 'Guess they're next.' I looked over at Hale, who was giving me a slight glare but nodded his head in greeting. I waved at him in correspondence, then brought my attention back to Kari. I pulled her into another hug and whispered in her ear. \"Do you know how much I missed you?\" She sighed. \"I missed you just as badly. Waiting was ridiculous.\" I chuckled lightly and kissed her cheek. \"I know, but it was worth it.\" She nodded as she wrapped her arms around my neck. I had my arms wrapped around her waist; the both of us just standing there holding each other in one anothers' arms. We heard some crunching from behind us and turned to see who it was. Bugs was standing there, munching on a carrot. \"You knew the whole time, huh?\" I gave him a look, but it wasn't threatening. Bugs shook his head. \"I had a hunch, but I wasn't so sure. I asked Yosemite to try to round 'em up, and he did. It's a miracle that he got the right people.\" Kari smiled at him and went over to him, hugging him gently. \"Thanks, Bugs. We missed you guys so much!\" The hare chuckled. \"We missed ya both just he same! Hey, Yosemite!\" He called over to the miniature cowboy with a large mustache. \"Yeah?\" Bugs grabbed his hand and shook it. \"Thanks for bringing them back, doc! You did everyone a favor here, all right!\" Yosemite smiled bashfully. \"It was nothin', really. We all missed 'em, so might as well, you know?\" I had to thank Sam later myself by treating him to some brownies later, as well as Bugs. Finally, I felt all sanity return back to me. \"Uh, hey Nawt?\" I glanced over to my left and saw Blanko bent down next to me. \"Who's that?\" He pointed at the raven haired girl that was playing the keyboard. Kari took note of this and smiled. \"This is my friend, Nada Sampson. We met back in middle school, so we've been friends ever since. Nada, come here a minute.\" Nada walked over nervously, her face obviously red. \"Y-yeah?\" Kari smiled at her and nudged her shoulder. \"I like to introduce you to Blanko. Blanko, Nada. Blanko is a cool guy, and a really nice person too. I think you guys should get acquainted, wouldn't you agree Nawt?\" I nodded my head with a sly grin. \"I agree. The two of you should get to know each other better. Well, Kari and I will leave you two at it.\" I took Kari's hand in mine as we got off the stage, leaving a bewildered Blanko and nervously stuttering Nada. They glanced at one another and gave each other shy smiles, then started talking to one another. \"Aw, how cute! I think they would go well together.\" Kari cried happily. I had to agree with her. Just like the two of us, I believe Blanko and that girl will get along very well. Hale was talking to Bang,Pound and Bupkus, who were baffled at what just happened there with Blanko and Nada. I thought to myself with a smile. 'Eh, give it some time. They'll find their pairs eventually.' Speaking of pairs... I pulled Kari a little closer to give her another kiss.. Until my ears caught the sound of something whirring in the air. \"Kari, move!\" I pulled her down with me as we landed on the floor. The loud sound of something sharp hit the floor, making a hole in the concrete. We looked up and to our horror, a large four bladed weapon was sticking out of the ground. The crown screamed in panic, majority of them fleeing. Hale rushed over to us, checking on his sister. My friends looked around in alarm, and Blanko had a protective hold on Nada, the both of them also panicking. We waited awhile to see if the attacker would strike again. Thankfully, they didn't. Hale and I helped Kari up to her feet. Pound walked over to the earth bound weapon and pulled it out. \"What the hell just happened?\" He asked aloud, looking over at each of us. I shrugged, taking a tight hold of Kari's hand in mine. She squeezed back, obviously scared out of her wits. 'Yeah.. just what the hell did happen?' I growled angrily. Someone wanted to hurt us. I glanced at the blade and looked closer at it. My face dropped in fear. No. Not us. Pound noticed the look on my face and flipped the quad-bladed weapon over. He gaped at it in shock. Someone wanted to hurt Kari. Hers and Hale's names were written on the center ring, clear as day.[Chapter 6] I have Chapter 6 here for you. Oh dear, I just love suspense. I own Kari and Hale Rodgers, along with their cousin Marie. This is just too good to be true for a fanfic. Enjoy! We all decided to gather up at the gymnasium after the sudden attack that took place at the amphitheater. Bugs asked Pound to carry the weapon over there as well so they could find out who the attacker may possibly be. On our way to the gym, I continued to feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest. My mind was trying to organize the information of the attack from a while ago as well as the one that occurred when we were pulled back into Looney Tune Land. Nawt must have noticed my nervousness as he held on to my hand and tried to soothe me. I glanced up to meet his gaze and gave him a small smile, trying to tell him I was okay. But in all truth, I really wasn't. Hale was walking on the other side of me, a worried look marred over his features. Seems he was pretty bothered about it too. Once we arrived and entered the gym, the majority of the Tunes took seats among the bleachers: Granny, Witch Hazel, Pepe, Lola, Tweety, Speedy Gonzalez, Taz, Porky, Elmer, and Barnyard Dog. Everyone else was up and about as they gathered around Pound who was holding the weapon. Pulling a table that was stored in the janitor closet, Bugs asked Pound to place the mysterious weapon on the table for examination. Placing the heavy four bladed knife, Daffy looked at the writing in the middle ring. \"Well, one thing's obvious: whoever threw this sucker is definitely after Kari and Hale.\" \"But why us? What did we do?\" Hale gave a confused look, though his eyes demanded for some answers. I turned to face Yosemite. \"Yosemite, may you pull out your rope for a moment?\" Taken aback at the request, he complied and pulled out his lasso. Unraveling it, everyone let out a small gasp as the end of his rope where the lasso was tied was completely severed off. \"Huh? Someone cut through my rope!\" He growled. My eyes grew in realization. 'Now I know I wasn't dreaming! It's the same person from way earlier when we were pulled through!' \"It's the same person.\" I gave a shudder. All eyes were now gaping at me. \"What do you mean, Kari?\" Hale gave an inquisitive look, curiosity getting the best of him. I gave him a serious look. \"I mean that this weapon was from the same person who cut off Yosemite's lasso. They were targeting us from the very beginning!\" Hale shook his head in bewilderment. \"But what did we do? Who would want to attack us?\" Everyone stood in thought, trying to figure out the same thing we were. Nada piped up, a light-bulb lighting up above her head. \"Hey, both of you came here before right? Was there someone who you met the last time you were here that held some kind of grudge against you?\" My brother and I gave her a delirious look. \"Someone we knew?\" Hale scrunched his face slightly, then it dropped as though he came to an answer; a frightening one. \"No way! It can't be!\" I knew who he was thinking about and shook my head incredulously. \"But- but we- no, the Monstars! They shot him back to outer space! How..?\" Nawt, Pound, and the other Monstars exchanged shocked glances, already getting the idea of who we were trying to mention. They didn't want to believe it, nor could they understand either as they were the ones who launched Swackhammer into the depths of space and back to Moron Mountain. \"But that's- that's impossible!\" Bupkus cried out. Bang nodded, scared at the thought of the possibility. \"We got rid of him! How can he even be back?\" Pound gave a stern look. \"I doubt it's him. He's back at Moron Mountain, for crying out loud! We made sure of that!\" Blanko wanted to believe him, but he still seemed unconvinced. Nawt looked at me with fright in his eyes. I knew he and the rest of the Monstars despised Swackhammer, and the mere idea of him returning here for revenge scared the guy even more. Bugs stepped in, calmly munching down on a carrot. \"Eh, now let's all think rationally about this. That bozo was launched back into space years ago when Kari won the game for our freedom. For the past six years, the has been no sign of the guy or even any attacks.. up till now.\" Pound raised a brow over at Bugs, scratching his head. \"What you gettin' at, Bugs?\" Bugs continued to snack on his vegetable, looking at him skeptically. \"What I'm tryin' to say is that after all these years, and he would choose to attack now? He had all the time in the world and could have done this all way back before these two arrived. I mean, the possibility is still there, but I have my doubts, doc.\" Bugs made a point. If he wanted to attack us, why not have done it a long time ago when we weren't here and out of our friends' range of protection? When we were still younger, smaller, and more vulnerable? 'Now that I think about it..' \"But there's still something that doesn't make sense about all this. If it is him, then why the trouble of waiting? Like you said, he had all these years and could have done his assault at any given time right then. So why now? We're not as vulnerable like we used to be way back.\" It bugged me big time. There was something in this picture that didn't make any sense at all. Bugs gazed at me in thought. \"Beats me, doc. I wouldn't worry so much about it, though. You guys just got here and over-analyzing this whole scenario is just gonna give ya a headache.\" \"But that's just it, Bugs! We just arrived! How is it that at the same moment we arrived, these attacks started to occur?\" Bugs shook his head. \"I'm afraid I don't have the answer for that one, Kari. True, it's a coincidence, but the possibility of it being Swackhammer are slim to none. There was absolutely no sign of him at all for all these years. Maybe it's just some upstaging clown who wants attention.\" I shook my head, still unsure about his reasoning despite that he made some pretty valid points. \"I dunno, Bugs.\" Hale had the same concerned look. \"I have to agree with my sister. This whole mess just doesn't seem right somewhere.\" Nada seemed lost at this whole discussion about Swackhammer and raised a brow. \"Um, you guys, who is this Swackhammer guy and what game are you talking about?\" Knocking out of my worried stupor for a moment, I glanced up at her and gave an small laugh. \"Sorry, Nada. Didn't mean to leave you in the dark here. Well, you see...\" I began to explain to her about how Hale and I first met the Monstars, who originally the Nerdlucks back when we met them. I told her about how we chased them down but failed in catching them and how I saved Nawt. Nawt smiled at the mention of the memory and I smiled back at him. I continued to tell her about both Hale and I getting pulled down the golf hole for the first time and arriving to Looney Tune Land, meeting the Tunes and their tragic situation of slavery to Swackhammer , as well as deciding to play basketball to help them win their freedom back. After I told her the entire tale, up to when Swackhammer was sent up to space stuffed inside a small spaceship and the talent show, leading up to their departure that lasted up until our current time which was today. Taking a breath after saying such a wild story, I looked at her and nearly jumped with surprise! Nada was streaming tears, finally blubbering out. \"Th-that was the saddest, y-yet most beautiful story I've ever h-heard!\" She crushed me in a tight hug and bawled. I patted her back, sighing. \"It's okay. You shouldn't be crying, Nada. We're all back together now, see?\" Abruptly, she stopped her sobbing and smiled brightly. \"Okay!\" 'Well, that was fast!' Straightening herself out, she glanced at me and Hale and smiled widely. I let out an \"oh!\", remembering something. \"By the way everyone, I would like to introduce you to my best friend, Nada Sampson. She's a dancer and attends the same high school as Hale and I.\" The Tunes and other Monstars greeted her happily and she did so in return. I turned to Wile who was holding on to Marie the entire time, not minding on watching the happy-go-lucky toddler. \"Also, this little tyke here is our cousin, Marie. She's only two years old, but she's cool and probably one of the most happiest kids we've ever met.\" Marie let out a giggle and waved her tiny hand. Everyone greeted her, a couple of \"aww's\" heard from some of the Tunes who were on the bleachers. Marie looked at the Monstars with wondrous eyes, until they landed on one in particular. She let out a loud squeal and ran over to Bupkus. This surprised the purple giant but he stayed where he was, not wanting to hurt the small girl as she ran up and hugged his leg. \"Kitty!\" The Monstars gaped at him for a brief moment before breaking out in a fit of laughter. \"Ooh! Bupkus is a kitty!\" Bang cried out, tears streaming out as he held onto his knees for support. Pound cracked up. \"Don't startle the cat now, Bang! He might just claw us to death!\" Blanko chuckled lightly, admitting how hilarious the situation was. Nawt tried to hold in his laugh, but failed miserably and leaned against Blanko's arm for support while snickering. I could help but let out a tiny fit of giggles and so did Nada, finding the sight to be funny and cute at the same time. The Tunes were laughing pretty hard, including Bugs. Hale was close to falling onto the floor as he held his ribcage, shrieking with laughter. Bupkus gave a deadpan look. \"Not funny, you guys.\" Nawt wiped away a tear and walked up to his friend. \"Oh, come on now man! You should be happy! The kid likes you, and just right off the bat too!\" Bupkus looked down at the tiny girl, who was nuzzling her face into his large, muscular shin. He couldn't help but sigh in defeat and chuckle at the situation. Bending down, he picked her up and lifted her into his arm. \"So I'm a kitty, am I?\" Marie gazed up at him with her rather large brown eyes and nodded. \"Kitty!\" Bupkus grinned, already liking the pet name she gave him. Then a devious thought came into his mind and grinned mischievously. \"Well, if I'm a kitty, then who are they?\" He pointed to each of the other Monstars, who immediately stopped their laughing tirade and gave wild looks at the two. Marie looked over at Pound and cried, pointing a small finger at him. \"Teddy!\" Bupkus gave a loud chortle at the priceless look on Pound's face. I giggled, finding it way too much to handle; Pound: the fearless leader is being called a teddy bear by a sweet two year old girl. Way too much! She then turned slightly in Bupkus' arm and looked at Blanko. \"Puppy!\" Blanko shrugged, smiling at the name. \"That's cool. I like puppies.\" Nada gave an adoring look towards Blanko as he said that. I caught sight of that and left it as it is with a mental note. Our cousin glanced down at Nawt and giggled. \"Bunny!\" Nawt had a poker-face as the Monstars laughed, liking the name. He also shrugged, allowing the name. Bupkus and Marie turned lastly to Bang, who gave a wild and funny look at the toddler. The name she chose for him, to my certainty, would never be lived down by any of us as Marie pointed at him. \"Pony!\" Everyone let out a booming laugh, including Nada and I. Hale couldn't hold himself up anymore and fell to the floor, his face beet red from laughing way too hard. I had to try and calm him down so he could breathe, but found it hard to do so. I was laughing almost just as hard, unable to grasp the name Bang was bestowed oh so generously by my cousin. Nawt fell on his bum, shrieking with glee. Blanko and Pound had tears streaming out of the corners of their eyes. Bupkus smiled with satisfaction at the little girl in his arm, who was smiling brightly. Bang cried out, his eyes boggling. \"How come I get such a gay nickname?\" Marie felt hurt by his words and began to sniff, her lower lip quivering. Bupkus saw this and gave Bang a death glare, as if saying ' take that back or I'll skin you, smart-ass! ' Bang noticed the glare and shrunk back, apologizing. \"Okay! It's a good name! I'm sorry!\" Marie stopped her sniffling and cooed happily. Bugs and the Tunes calmed down from their fit. He sighed and walked up to me and Hale. \"Alright, well how about this? To make you two more at ease, we'll take turns patrolling around the area for any sign of Swackhammer, if he's here.\" Hale and I exchanged glances of relief. Bugs smiled and nodded. \"I take that as a 'yes', then?\" We both nodded our heads. It would be a great idea, plus it would definitely give all of us peace of mind. Hale then perked his head up and rose to his feet. \"Wait, how can we come back here? We can't have necklaces anymore since those gems that we had were the very last ones and we gave them up for the potion for the Monstars.\" Witch Hazel approached us and smiled. \"Ever heard of the story of 'Alice in Wonderland'?\" We gave her strange looks but nodded. \"Yeah. Why?\" I gave her a questioning look. She motioned her hand lightly in the air. \"Well, how did she manage to return to Wonderland the second time?\" We gave thoughtful looks, until it hit me. \"Through a mirror.\" I realized what she was getting at and cast a surprised and joyful look at Hale, who returned it merrily. Taking out a small bag, she dug her hand inside and pulled it out. \"Now all four of you come here and stay still.\" We approached her, along with Nada who took Marie momentarily from Bupkus. Opening her hand, she blew some red powder at us. We coughed and sneezed as the powder covered us from inch to inch then fully dissolved away. \"What was that?\" Hale hacked, who breathed in some of the powder. She smiled, her eyes twinkling gleefully. \"It's a special powder that I formulated. It's effects are permanent: it will allow you to travel through mirrors of any kind to get from your world to ours. It's far more easier than jewelry, I believe.\" We couldn't believe what we were hearing. Now we could travel from any mirror in our world and transverse over to Looney Tune Land. \"Will it work vise-versa?\" Hale asked. Hazel nodded. \"Yep, any mirror in your world and any inn our world, so long as it's large enough for your body to pass through it.\" The Monstars and Tunes were also fascinated by this new method of transportation. Bugs tapped her shoulder. \"Eh, Hazel, do ya think you can do the same with that powder to us and our alien friends, here? You know, in case we want to go see them or get them for any reason?\" She nodded and quipped. \"Sure! We would have to go to my shop for that though. I only had enough powder in here for these four.\" Everyone chatted excitedly. \"Well, if you want I'll go with you back to your shop and we can get the powder right away. Lola, you want to help us?\" Lola walked over to her boyfriend and nodded. \"Sure thing, Bugs.\" Witch Hazel complied happily as they made their way to the doors. Bugs turned to face the lot of us. \"We'll be back in a few, docs. Just stay here and make yourselves at home for now. Enjoy; you guys just returned here and everyone practically missed ya!\" As they took their leave, we turned and decided to get comfortable. I walked over to Nawt, who gave me a warm smile. He motioned for me to go sit with him at the bleachers. We walked over and took a seat, while everyone else was chatting happily away. While everyone was talking among one another merrily, Pound was looking over the weapon. Nawt raised a brow and patted my hand. \"I'll be back.\" I nodded, knowing he was just as curious as anyone would be. Nawt walked up to Pound. \"What's up? Found something?\" Pound gave a grim look but shook his head. \"I dunno. I don't wanna say, but I think Hale and Kari's hunch are right.\" Nawt glanced down at the weapon and sighed. \"Do you think he's back?\" Pound shrugged. \"Who knows, man? All I know is we got some psycho running around trying to hurt the kids. No offense to Bugs, but we should take this a little more seriously.\" Nawt grunted in agreement. Oblivious to their current surroundings and mine, the Tunes and Monstars decided to leave things be. I somewhat overheard Nawt and Pound's conversation and couldn't help but wonder if Swackhammer was back. I hope I was wrong and that it's like what Bugs said. Third Person POV: From a hole in the far corner of the bleachers across where Kari was sitting, two red glowing eyes were staring sinisterly at the two siblings.. especially Kari. The evil figure grinned a rather evil and cruel grin, breathing out some smoke from the cigar in his mouth. \"I found you... And soon, very soon... you'll be mine !\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7! OMG! Squee! I own nothing except Kari, Hale, and Marie. Now sit tight and hold on for delight! In the meantime... trolls le Facebook. :3 We enjoyed ourselves to the fullest for the remainder of the day with the Tunes and the Monstars. Nawt and I talked about all that has happened over the past six years and what changed. I told him that Hale quit the soccer team and decided to join the male basketball team. I did the same and joined the female basketball team in our school, and that the two of us took time during after school hours practicing with our music and singing new songs like the ones from our earlier performance. He told me that the Tunes renovated the old abandoned house that they were in and made it into a full blown mansion. My eyes went huge at this news, but I let him continue. He also explained that things went downhill for him after their departure from our world, but he did his best to keep his hopes up for the sake of his friends and myself. I completely understood how he felt and what he went through; I had to do the same for the sake of my family and friends too. Hale kept a close eye on the both of us, making sue that we didn't do anything he thought as 'sneaky'. Sometimes I admire how my brother takes care of me, but by now, he should know that Nawt wouldn't do anything to harm me in any way. I hope he isn't still suspicious of Nawt, even after all these years. After a half hour or so, Bugs, Witch Hazel, and Lola came back with some large bags full of the red powder that was administered to us earlier. First the Monstars were up to get peppered with the snowy substance, followed by the Tunes themselves. Now everyone was able to cross mirrors to each others worlds, apparently. I felt happy about this cause this gives me more chances to see Nawt again! I think Hale knew what I was thinking and shot me a look that says 'don't even think about it'. I merely stuck my tongue out at him playfully; he'll never win at this. Looking up at the clock, Nada pleaded excuse to Blanko, who nodded and let her pass to see us. \"Guys, it's getting late. Shouldn't we head back to your place now?\" Hale and I glanced at the clock and we nodded simultaneously. I went over to Bupkus, who was playing with Marie, rolling a basketball over to her and she rolled it back. \"Sorry, big guy. We got to head home now. We'll be back tomorrow though, so you two can play again later!\" He gave a disappointed look, but let it go and nodded. Everyone waved goodbye to us reluctantly, slightly upset that we had to leave already. Nawt and the Monstars walked up to us to give us hugs, except Hale who just accepted a fist bump from each of them. Manly pride, you know? Nawt leaned down close to my ear. \"I know I won't be able to come by so easily now that Hale is a bit more sensitive about us, so I'll see you tomorrow, okay?\" I nodded happily. Even though he's my brother, Hale can still be quite a handful when it isn't necessary. We bid them all farewell for the day, including Marie despite that she really didn't want to and wanted to continue playing with Bupkus. Smiling at Nawt, I waved goodbye as we stepped through a mirror that Witch Hazel brought in from her shop and disappeared. We immediately found ourselves standing in the middle of my bedroom in front of my full body length mirror. \"It worked! Witch Hazel's mirror powder worked!\" Nada cried in glee and surprise. Marie glanced around in awe. Hale shook his head, amazed as well. \"That Witch Hazel is something else, man. She really doesn't fail in any of her stuff, does she?\" I nodded in confirmation. Hale walked out of my room and headed down the stairs. \"Hale, where ya goin'?\" Nada called out. Marie wobbled her way towards my bedroom door to follow him. I scooped her up and motioned Nada to come along. We reached the bottom of the stairs and walked to the living room, where Hale was busy checking the message machine. The red digital numbers indicated that there were three messages left while we were gone. My brother pressed the 'play' button as we listened for the first message. The machine played. \" First message at 11:48 A.M: 'Hey Kari, Hale! It's me, mom. Just want to let you two know that we have to stay at Maine for about a month or so. It seems that your Aunt's situation was a lot worse than we expected and your father is no better off than her. He's trying to arrange a business deal with some national representatives, but they won't be here for another week or two and things are just a complete mess. I'll let you two know if anything changes. Hale, you have your debit card, so make any necessary purchases for yourselves, okay? Love you. Take care of Marie.' Message ended. Second message at 1:10 P.M: 'Hello Kari and Hale! This is Nada's parents! Just want to let you know that we'll be out of town for a while. Nada's grandmother called from Chicago and got really ill, so we'll be taking leave to help her get back to health. If Nada could hang around with you guys while we're away, it would be great. We apologize for the inconvenience and take care! We don't know for how long we'll be gone, but we'll call again to let you know! Bye!' Message ended. Third message at 3:26 P.M: 'This is a message for all county wide public schools: students, all classes and schools have been canceled due to bomb threats and other safety hazards that have occurred until further notice. If you have any questions or concerns, please call-\" Hale stopped the machine from finishing. He glanced at us with a very concerned look. Nada and I couldn't help but wonder about it as well. 'This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.. First mom and dad are going to take longer in their trip along with Aunt Jackie, then Nada's parents are gone due to Nada's grandma having health issues and now all the schools throughout the whole county have bomb threats! We got attacked twice today too... Just what the hell is going on around here?' Nada couldn't believe her ears. \"I hope gran is okay..\" I could tell she was worried. Feeling like I should giver her some assurance, I placed my hand on her shoulder. \"Don't worry, Nada. I'm sure your grandmother will be fine! We just gotta keep our heads up and pray.\" She nodded with a small smile, still looking shell shocked from the three messages left on the answering machine. Hale clenched his jaw, his eyes staring down hard at the machine. I had a feeling about what he was thinking, and to be frank, I couldn't help but wonder as well if all this had to do with the attacks from earlier today... Nada took charge of helping me feed Marie as we finished preparing dinner. The both of us combined feminine forces and baked sweet potato casserole and had some sweet bread with some kiwi juice that Hale made with the blender. Hale was doing the dishes while I got the garbage bag ready to throw it out. My brother gave me a worried look, pausing from his washing the dishes. \"Kari, it's kinda dark out. You sure you don't need any help?\" I grinned up at him. \"That's okay. I got it, Hale. Besides, it's just a quick run to the driveway and back; I won't take long.\" Nada gave a side glance. \"Be careful, Kari. You know that weirdos come out on a full moon.\" I shook my head at her superstition. Yeah, it was a full moon out tonight, but it didn't mean that I was gonna get attacked by a weirdo. Besides, I would feel sorry for the idiot who would even try. Hale and I took spare martial arts lessons and self defense, so getting grabbed by some hooligan was the least of my worries at the moment. \"I'll be back in a minute!\" I called out as I stepped onto the front porch with the large bag full of garbage. As I made my way to the waste can, I began to grow tense. The hairs on my arms began to stand upright and I had a tingle sensation of goosebumps. I scolded myself at how I was behaving, telling myself it only takes ten seconds to throw the garbage out and head back in. I opened the lid and tossed the bag into the can then turned around to head back into the house. Then I heard some rustling coming from the bushes. I turned over to see what it was. Getting a little edgy and ticked, I decided to call out. \"Who's there? I'm warning you, I'm trained in judo!\" Nothing but silence replied. I growled to myself and started making my way back, until I heard the rustling again, only louder this time. I quickly turned around again, my fists raised up. The blood pumped loudly in my ears as I felt panic rising slightly. \"This isn't funny! Who the hell is there? Answer me!\" I still didn't get an answer, and that was enough to bother me to the point of hauling ass out of there and back into the safety of my home. My breathing steadied after a bit, then I froze. I heard breathing. It was coming from right behind me. Feeling a small trickle of sweat running down the side of my face, I prepared myself. I clenched my fists, and steadied my balance on my feet. I immediately turned around to come face to face with.. nothing. Absolutely nothing. 'This is beyond freaky! Just what is going on?' \"Kari? Are you okay?\" I turned to see my brother standing right there on the porch with a concerned look on his face. \"Uh, yeah. I'm fine.\" I muttered. I took another glance around me, seeing nothing out of the ordinary catching my eye. \"Kari, get inside. You been out here a little too long.\" Hale looked uneasy, like he sensed what I was sensing just a moment ago. I looked over at him and nodded. This is getting to be a bit too much in just one day! As I got into the house and locked the door behind me, I turned to face Hale. \"I think we should head to Looney Tune Land first thing in the morning.\" Hale gave me a questioning look. \"What? Why, is something the matter? Did you- did you see something?\" I shook my head, frowning towards the door behind me. \"No, but I do know that something ain't right around here. We might want to bring this up to Bugs.\" Hale sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Yeah, but he might just insist that it's all in our head. He didn't take what happened earlier that seriously, so why this?\" Narrowing my eyes slightly, I turned to face my brother. \"Then we'll get him to listen. You know as well as I do that something's terribly wrong, Hale. If we just choose to ignore this, then things will just get worse. We can't let that happen.\" He gave me a surprised look for a brief minute then chuckled. \"Alright, you're the boss; you win. We'll get ourselves ready early tomorrow morning, including Nada and Marie and head straight to Looney Tune Land. So.. you really think Swackhammer is back?\" His face turned from mellow agreement to serious as he gave me direct eye contact. I gave a hesitant nod. There isn't a doubt about that gut feeling I have, despite that I wanted to doubt it myself for the sake of things. We agreed then to leave straight to Looney Tune Land the earliest chance we had and locked all doors and windows of the house. Lucky for me that Hale went out to fetch me when he did; I had the strangest and most uncomfortable feeling that someone was out there and watching me and has indeed tried to get me. Little did I know that if I stayed out there any longer, a giant pair of hands belonging to a figure with the most glowing evil red eyes would have tried to grab me from behind right on the spot...[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 is here! For you loyal readers, I have submitted art for this fanfic! There will be more coming up later this week, I promise you! Go to Deviant Art and search 'Kyohyama'. That's my deviant pen name. Now enjoy this new chapter! I own Kari, Hale, and Marie. No more, no less. Note: New OCs will appear later in this story. Just like we planned, Hale and I woke up with an early start. He dressed up in a navy blue long-sleeve and wore khaki pants and his white Nike's. I showered and dressed up in a dark blue and white striped shirt and khaki shorts along with my knee high brown leather boots. I snapped on my bracelet that Nawt gave to me and went to go fetch Marie. Waking up the tiny girl gently, she stirred and cooed when she saw me. I picked her up and got her out of her pajamas. I placed a violet long-sleeve with matching color pants on her and pink tennis shoes with white frilly socks. I tied her hair into a side ponytail and picked her up, heading out to the hallway. Hale was standing next to the other guest room door, waiting for Nada to finish dressing up. He seemed a bit irritated, which was no surprise cause I knew why. \"You girls take forever to get ready! This isn't a beauty pageant, you know?\" I scowled at him, holding Marie against my hip. \"We like to look nice, Hale. Just relax; she'll be out in a minute. In the meantime, why don't you come downstairs with me and help me get some breakfast going? Marie needs to eat too, you know?\" He grunted but followed in tow as we walked down the long steps and headed straight into the kitchen. I placed Marie in her high chair while Hale opened the fridge to get some eggs, butter, milk and juice out. Nada arrived downstairs about five minutes later, dressed in a yellow tunic and blue hipster jeans with orange sneaks. Her long black hair was left flowing loose past her shoulders. \"Sorry I'm a bit late! I had to charge my cell phone at the last minute. It was as good as dead, practically.\" I gave her a welcoming smile. \"It's okay. Just take a seat; breakfast will be served in a moment.\" I brought up her plate, which was filled with fried egg, a banana, and buttermilk waffles with some natural maple syrup. She helped herself to a glass of orange juice from our pitcher. \"Thanks! I'm starved!\" Nada began to chow down her food instantly. I fed Marie her small plate of egg and some mashed up banana. She drank up her juice in a spill-proof cup, having her fill. \"Uhp!\", she belched. I giggled and wiped her tiny mouth gently with a napkin. Hale devoured his entire meal and went up to go wash his dishes. Nada finished soon after and got up with her china. \"I'll wash it. Help Kari get whatever we need ready.\" Hale took her plate and glass. Nada sauntered over to me as I helped Marie out of her high chair. \"Need any help?\" I motioned my head to the baby bag on the counter. \"Just that. We got everything else.\" Nada picked up the bag and slung it over her shoulder. \"Why do we have to leave this early? Is something the matter? It has to do with what happened yesterday, isn't it?\" Hale finished washing all the dishes and dried his hands on the kitchen towel. \"It's just a matter of security. Kari and I are getting really concerned about what is going on, so we need to tell someone. The Tunes and the Monstars are the only ones that will listen.\" We made our way back up to my bedroom, and gathered up in front of my body length mirror. Hale insisted on going last, since he is physically more stronger and for safety reasons. I went first, making my way towards the mirror. I held my right hand out while holding Marie in my left arm. My hand starting going through the mirror, like it was made of liquid. Gathering the rest of my courage, I went entirely into the mirror with my baby cousin. I looked around to view my current surroundings and found myself standing in a bedroom; a male's bedroom. There was a desk with a computer on it and some books in a shelf next to it. Glancing out the window, I could tell I was on the second story of the house. I was somewhat too entranced by my surroundings that I didn't pay attention to Marie's cooing and squealing. Then I felt two big hands firmly gripping on to my waist and pull my down gently into a red and black checkered poster bed. At first I hesitated, but relaxed as I heard the familiar voice groan into my ear happily. \"I could wake up to this. It's a nice wake up call.\" I smiled and turned carefully with Marie still in my arms. Nawt grinned sleepily, then yawned for he just woke up to me arriving in his room. Marie suddenly became fascinated with a black throw pillow above her head and pulled it down to gaze at it in wonder. I laughed gently as she poked and patted the pillow contently. I was slightly startled as Nawt ran a finger into my hair. \"Oops. Sorry.\" He chuckled for making me jump slightly. Marie didn't seem to notice or care as she kept touching the warm pillow in her hands. I gazed up at Nawt, who was sitting up on his left arm, gazing back down at me. That's when I noticed that his chest was bare. I started flushing up a storm at the sight. He must have noticed this as he let out a low growl.. almost like it was pleasured. \"Like what you see?\" 'Nooo.. really, Nawt? I will probably end up having a nosebleed just for looking at you shirtless!' I felt him moved around a bit and snapped out of my dazing stupor, only to find him a few inches now away from my face. I could feel his warm breath ghosting over my face, not helping with the now clearly visible blush on my features. His eyes were inducing me in a trance almost, as I couldn't look away from them as they bore into mine. He smiled pleasantly. \"You know, you're always welcome to stop by to wake me up. It works better than Pound's incessant shouting.\" I giggled lightly at the last part, imagining Pound roaring like a raging gorilla. \"You look beautiful, Kari.\" I gazed up at him with wide eyes at his comment. He called me beautiful. That is the very first time that anyone has ever said that to me. Even my own parents and brother didn't call me that! We looked deeply into each others eyes for a long moment until he started to move again, lowering himself down closer to me. Then he stopped, his lips only a couple centimeters away from mine. My heart was beating at an insanely fast rate. I tried not to hurt Marie, but she was nodding off, still hugging the throw pillow. Nawt was also still lingering up above me, his eyes analyzing my face from top to bottom and taking in every detail, it seemed. Then we both jumped as his bedroom door swung wide open, Hale, Nada, and the rest of the Monstars poking their heads through the doorway. Poor Marie also jumped when we did, and almost started to cry until she caught sight of Bupkus. \"Kitty!\" She squealed delightedly. Bupkus quickly shuffled in and picked up the two year old child, then gave a a disapproving look. \"If you guys are gonna do it, don't drag the poor kid in! You little nasties..\" I sat up and stammered. \"W-what? No! We weren't- it's just- he- I-\" Nawt looked just as flustered, scrambling out of his bed sheets. \"Now hold up! We didn't- we weren't even- Why the hell would we-\" I looked over at Hale and jumped back a bit with a squeak. He had a flaming look in his eyes, frowning deeply at the sight that they saw. Nada was behind him next to Blanko, her hands covering her mouth and also flushing up a storm. \"Oh, my.\", was all she could say. Blanko had his eyes wide at the scene, then shook his head as if saying 'oh brother'. Bang had his jaw hanging wide open, shocked at the sight. He looked over at Nawt. \"I think you should put a shirt on man.\" Nawt gave an annoyed look at Bang. \"Yeah, yeah. Keep your shorts on.\" I think I grew another shade of red as I heard Bang mutter \"Shouldn't you be doing that instead?\" Pound squeezed his eyes irritably, grumbling to himself. \"This is gonna be a long day, for sure.\" After Nawt got his stuff together and Hale giving me a long speech about not being alone with a guy at any given time, we all got down to the Monstars' living room while Pound called Bugs and asked him and some of the Tunes to come over as quickly as they could. Bupkus was busy playing with Marie, throwing her up gently in the air and catching her every time she came back down. Bang came into the living room with some lemonade in glasses on a tray. I found the sight to be funny and giggled lightly to myself. Hale tried not to crack up and bit his lip. After a couple moments we heard knocking at the front door. Pound went and opened it up. \"Glad you could make it, Bugs.\" Bugs stepped inside the domain, munching on his carrot as usual. \"Eh, no problem, doc.\" The rest of the Tunes that came with him followed right behind: Lola, Daffy, Witch Hazel, Tweety, Sylvester, Foghorn, Yosemite, Elmer, Porky, Pepe, and Wile. As everyone entered the living room, we got up and gave them all warm greetings. Once we all got accommodated and settled down, Bugs finished the last of his carrot and looked over at me and Hale. \"Alright, you two. What's the big story?\" He sat down, his attention along with everyone else directly aimed at us. Hale took in a deep breath and exhaled. \"We got a couple messages yesterday when we got back home. I dunno about you guys, but we find it really bizarre.\" Daffy raised a brow. \"What kind of messages?\" I glanced over at him, unable to shake the numbing feeling now enveloping my body. \"First, our parents: they're having some kind of business trip going on, but now the time of them being gone is extended even further due to some odd complications.\" Hale picked up from there. \"Then Nada's parents. For a really strange reason, her grandmother got sick and it's apparently got so bad to the point that her parents had to leave as well. The amount of time that they have to be there is uncertain, although they estimated about a month or so, which is about the same for our parents.\" Nada decided to speak up the last bit of information herself. \"Not only that, but now all the schools in our county are canceling classes completely due to sudden bomb threats that have been heard around the local areas. Bugs, we don't think that this is just coincidental anymore. This is now a serious issue!\" The Tunes muttered among themselves in utter shock at the news. The Monstars, too, gave each other odd looks and even looked terrified at the sudden turn of events that have occurred as of late. Bugs sat back, his brow arching in deep concern. \"Well, you're absolutely right. Now it's become something serious; this isn't just some mere prank, huh?\" Hale, Nada, and I shook our heads no. \"This is as serious as it gets, Bugs. There's someone who's definitely out there trying to get us.\" Hale eyed the rabbit with a grave glance. I fidgeted my fingers against one another. The thought of what happened outside last night when I went to take out the garbage unnerved me. Daffy must have caught that, as he asked me aloud. \"You okay, kid? You look disturbed about something.\" I glanced up and met everyone's gaze. Turning to Hale, who furrowed his brows in worry, I sighed. \"Well, I can't say for sure, but.. Last night, when I went to run the garbage out, I felt like someone was watching me.\" Hale hitched his breath in surprise. \"Hold on! Someone was out there with you?\" I shook my head. \"I don't know. But I heard some strange rustling noises near the bushes and.. heavy breathing. Now that I think about it...\" I recalled the smell in the air last night was heavier than usual, like it was smothered with another powerful smell. Then it hit me. \"No.. He's definitely back!\" Nawt almost jumped out of his seat. \"Wait.. Swackhammer? But he can't be!\" I got up from the chair. \"It's definitely him! The air last night. Why didn't I notice it before?\" Pound grounded his teeth nervously. \"What do you mean, the air?\" \"It reeked ! It smelled of smoke; cigar smoke! No one smokes within blocks from us, and in case you forgot, he smokes cigars!\" An eery silence fell among all of us. Nada grabbed on to Blanko's hand, gently squeezing it. The Tunes exchanged nervous and frightened glances with one another. Bugs cleared his throat and got up, walking up to me. He gave me a look, one mixed with seriousness and worry. \"I think it's best if you guys stuck around here for a couple days. Go back home and get whatever belongings you may need and then come back straight here. You're not safe being alone in your house by yourselves at this time. On second thought, just stay here while Daffy, Lola and I go to your world and get your stuff.\" Hale nearly fell out of his chair. \"Wait! Are you sure? What if our parents call?\" Daffy gave him a dumbfounded look. \"Don't you have a cell phone? We'll just go get your clothes and phone chargers and be back shortly!\" \"Hold up! Let us write down what we need.\" I took a sheet of paper that was on the desk behind Pound and a pen. I started to scribble down a list of things we may possibly need, with each of our names above each short list. I handed the list over to Lola, who took it carefully. Bugs grinned reassuringly. \"Alright, we won't try to take long. You sure you wrote down everything?\" I nodded. Daffy turned around and faced a mirror that Witch Hazel and Foghorn brought in with them when they arrived. \"Well then, let's skedaddle!\" The three of them jumped into the mirror, dissolving into the glass. Nada brought her knees up to her chest, felling slightly anxious. Blanko rubbed her back, trying to soothe her the best he could. Bupkus was holding on to a now sleeping Marie, her breathing slow and easy. Hale was pacing around in the living room, some of the Tunes watching him with worried expressions. Nawt made his way over to the loveseat I was sitting on and sat next to me. He took a hold of my hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. \"It'll be okay. You guys can stay here for the time being, if you'd like. We got spare rooms.\" I nodded in appreciation. \"Thanks, Nawt. I hope it isn't a bother.\" Pound chuckled from the far corner near the desk. \"It ain't a bother, hun. You guys are more than welcome to stay here for as long as you need. Just don't let me catch you two lovebirds again like this morning.\" I flushed mildly at the memory of this morning's situation. Nawt grew a shade darker of red at the mention of it, too. Minutes passed as we all waited for Bugs, Lola, and Daffy to return. I grew slightly tired with having nothing to do. I leaned against Nawt, with my head propped on his shoulder. He gently rested his head on mine, wrapping an arm protectively around me. 'I hope those guys are okay..' That was my last thought as I nodded off to sleep against my lovable red alien. Third Person POV: Lola was gathering the rest of the girl's items and putting them into their separate duffel bags. She packed a couple of shirts and tops for Kari, including a pair of sneakers and sandals and some socks, jeans, and undergarments. She did the same for Nada and closed both bags. \"Ready!\" She called out to her comrades from the guest bedroom where Nada was staying in. Daffy grabbed a teddy bear that was inside the crib and put it inside the baby bag, along with some pairs of underwear, dresses, shorts and shirts and two pairs of pajamas. \"Does this kid need this much stuff? Oh, boy..\" He grabbed the baby blanket and stuffed it into the bag then zipped it shut. \"I'm done here too!\" Bugs packed the last of Hale's clothes and shoes, as well as his cell phone charger. He closed his duffel bag and picked it up securely. \"All right, let's head back!\" Before he could take another step, a loud crashing sound was heard from the room across. Startled, Bugs gripped Hale's duffel and rushed out, Daffy and Lola mimicking the same reaction. As the three of them made their way back to Kari's room, the stopped dead in their tracks at the sight before them. Daffy glimpsed at Lola and Bugs with a similar terrified expression as his comrades. \"Well, this can't be good..\" In front of them, Kari's mirror was smashed into itty bitty pieces, the shards of glass on the floor forming the words 'I'M BACK! '[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 is here after a two day delay. Suspense isn't over yet! I own nothing except Kari, Hale, and Marie. I stirred to the smell of pasta wafting in air and into my nose. Waking, I found myself in Nawt's bedroom on his bed. As I was about to get up, I felt a pair of arms tightening their hold around my waist. I slowly turned and saw Nawt holding on to me, still sleeping. I smiled at the sight, his breathing deep but level. 'He's so cute when he's asleep. I should wake him up though.' I figured that shaking him gently would stir him, but another thought came into my mind. Carefully, I leaned closer and lifted my finger up to his face. I began to gently stroke my finger down the bridge of his nose, causing it to twitch every time I ran it down. His eyes started to flutter as he was waking up. He yawned and stretched a bit, bringing my body much closer to his. Then he froze, as if in shock. I was about to ask, but he looked down at me with wide eyes then down at his bed then his surroundings. \"How did we get in here?\" I gawked at him. \"Huh? You mean, it wasn't you who brought me here?\" He shook his head, sitting up on his bed. \"I was out shortly after you nodded off. I wonder who-\" He halted in mid sentence as he caught sight of a note on his night table. He read it, mumbling mostly to himself. ' If you wake up and find this note, then kudos! You two lovebirds fell asleep and Hale wouldn't shut up about it, so I brought you two up here. You can thank me later. Don't do anything dumb when you wake up though.. Pound will get pissed.' Bupkus I gazed over and read the letter after Nawt finished, his face contorted with wonder. \"Huh, so Bupkus brought us up here. Who would have thought.. And he was the one who called us 'little nasties'..\" Before I could say anything more, I was tackled by Nawt and the both of us were brought down onto his bed. I tried to move, but his body was too heavy for me to budge. \"Hey. Time to get up!\" He mumbled something into my neck, then I yelped as I felt him gently nibble down on the nape of my neck. \"Nawt!\" I cried lightly, feeling the familiar butterfly sensation in my stomach. He raised his head and looked down at me, then buried his head back down and blew raspberries into my neck, causing me to throw a fit of giggles. \"No! Stop it! Ha ha!\" I thought I was going to run out of air from laughing too hard as he continued blowing raspberries and poking my sides in addition. I punched him lightly, then he settled down. I calmed my laughter down, small tears streaming down from the corners of my eyes. Nawt raised himself onto his elbows and looked down at me with such adoration. I couldn't help but look back at him the same, a gracefully happy smile gracing my features. \"You know, we have to go downstairs eventually. We have to eat something.\" He looked at me quizzically. \"Oh, do we have to?\" I nodded. \"Yes, Nawt. Why? You're not hungry?\" He shrugged. \"A little bit, but I don't wanna go back down just yet.\" I raised a brow. \"How come?\" Then he slid his arms underneath me and nuzzled his face close to mine. \"Cause I want to be selfish.\" I couldn't help but laugh airily at the response. He's so sweet and playful, yet can me mature when he wants to be. I glanced up at him. \"We can't have Bupkus get into trouble. He was the one who got us up here, and without Pound and Hale's knowledge, by the looks of it.\" Sighing, he raised himself up and rolled off of me. He gave me a wink and smiled. \"Alright, you win. But later I'll have you all to myself! It's not fair that after waiting six years that I'm suddenly given restrictions.\" 'Trust me. I know the feeling.. I'm just too hungry right now! Wonder how long we've been out?' I glanced over to his alarm clock and gasped at the time. \"We've been out for three hours! Why didn't anyone bother waking us up?\" Nawt shrugged again. \"Je ne sais pas.\" I raised a brow at him. \"You speak French?\" He chuckled. \"A little bit. Got bored, so I learned a thing or two from my language encyclopedias.\" I shook my head in mild amusement. He will never cease to amaze me, that's for sure. He took my hand in his, giving me a silly grin. \"Well, let's go down and eat! Wouldn't want to keep anyone waiting!\" Opening the door, we walked out of his room, down the long hallway and headed down the stairs in the direction of the kitchen. From below, we heard the Tunes chattering, indicating they were still here. When we got down to the living room, we noticed Pound letting in Bugs, Daffy, and Lola into the home with our belongings. Hale glanced over and saw the two of us. \"Hey! Where were you guys?\" I gave him a shrug. \"We woke up in separate rooms and met up with one another on our way down. Guess we were so out of it, someone must have put us in somewhere.\" Surprisingly, he bought it and motioned for us to join everyone else. As we approached the Tunes, Nawt looked over at Bupkus, who gave him a knowing wink. Bupkus smirked back but immediately changed his expression when Pound went over to join them. \"So what happened? You guys were gone for a long time!\" Hale approached Bugs with a worried frown. Bugs placed the duffel down and gave an apologetic look. \"Sorry, Hale. Turns out you and your sister were right, though.\" I stared at Bugs with a shocked expression. Hale was completely stunned beyond belief. \"W-what? You mean you saw him?\" The hare shook his head. \"He broke the mirror in Kari's bedroom and left a message.\" He handed over a photo of the mess in front of my mirror, spelling the words: 'I'M BACK!' with the glass pieces. My brother and I were speechless. Hale handed the photo over to the Monstars, who flipped out at the sight. \"He's back..\" Bang whimpered with an overwhelmed expression. Marie looked as if she was going to cry and tried to snug herself closer to Bupkus, who was gently hushing her tiny mewls and whimpers. Pound gave an angry glance at the photo, muttering some swear words under his breath. Nawt bit his lip, though he was glaring at the photo. Blanko was beyond upset and was shuffling uncomfortably around on the carpet. I walked up to Bugs, still confused as ever. \"But did you see him? What does he want?\" Daffy waltzed up, placing Marie's baby bag down on a chair. \"We didn't see him, but it's pretty clear that this psycho is back for sure. He sure seems desperate to get to you guys, let alone get under your skin.\" \"Desperate? More like obsessed! Doesn't he get it? We won; he lost! Being a sore loser about the past makes this guy really lower than he already is.\" Hale threw his hands up to emphasize his point. Bugs nodded. \"We know, but there's nothing we can really do right now. What we can do for now is just keep you guys here with us until things at least settle down for a bit. Witch Hazel will help make a new mirror to replace your old one, and it'll be much better and more difficult to break.\" None of us here liked any of what was going on, but we couldn't do much except comply. Our only hope is that Swackhammer is either eventually caught or shows up. Though, I somehow doubt that all will go as smoothly and easily like that. Pound stepped up and cleared his throat, gaining everyone's attention. \"We'll keep the kids here until all seems okay. We have extra bedrooms here to spare, so it won't be such a problem.\" I felt a small blush rise as I glanced over at Nawt, who wiggled his brows and flashed a toothy grin. I chuckled quietly, not wanting my brother to notice and jump into conclusions. \"Eh, okay, doc. I know can trust the kids in your care. Just let any of us know if there's anything we can do to help.\" Pound nodded, confirming the arrangement. Daffy and Lola helped to bring up the bags and placed them in each guest room. I asked if I could keep Marie with me in the same room, though Bupkus insisted that he'll keep guard of the toddler and took her stuff with him into his room. 'Looks like Marie has really grown on Bupkus.' Hale got a his room near the end of the other hall, while Nada got the next room over and I got the last room closest to the adjacent hall where the Monstars' rooms were. Nada got herself accommodated and arranged her belongings out of the bag. She decided that she wanted to have a tour and was about to ask me to join her, until Blanko showed up and bravely opted to show her around. She flushed lightly, but kindly accepted his voluntary notion. Hale got out of his room once he got his stuff set up and went to check on me. He knocked lightly on my door, getting my attention. \"Hey, bro! What's up?\" He smiled but then gave me a concerned look. \"So last night, you think it was Swackhammer who was hiding in our front yard?\" I nodded, confirming our worst thoughts and fears. \"Well, I doubt that since we're here in Looney Tune Land that he'll be able to get us. I'm gonna go ask Pound a couple of questions. I think he's talking somethings over with Bugs and the other Tunes. You gonna be okay?\" I laughed at this expression of brotherly oversight. \"I'll be fine, Hale. Like you said, we'll be fine with the Monstars and Tunes. Just go take care of business. I'm just gonna finish unpacking my stuff here.\" He gave a slight nod then sprinted off to find the two people he needed to talk to. After a few minutes, I finished unpacking my bag and placed the empty piece of luggage next to the wall across from the bed. Ironically, I heard a knock at the door right at that moment. I turned around and saw Nawt leaning on the door frame. \"Hey, just finished unpacking my stuff. Lola is really organized with everything!\" He chuckled and walked in, closing the door securely behind him. \"Nawt, what are you up to?\" I crossed my arms playfully, arching a brow at him. He gave me an innocent look, his eyes large and puppy like. \"Nothing. Just wanna say hi to my favorite girl, that's all.\" I giggled. \"I doubt it. You even said before we left from your room, that you wanted me all to yourself... and we haven't eaten yet!\" Before I could say or do anything else, Nawt sauntered over in a blink and embraced me. He cupped my cheek and glanced down at me with a gentle smile. \"I think food can wait. Right now, I'm craving for something else..\" He leaned down and kissed my forehead, then went lower and kissed the tip of my nose then stopped just above my lips, hovering there. Gazing into his eyes and him gazing into mine, I really hoped he would do what he intends to instead of just teasing me like he is. For once, this favor was immediately answered. Nawt bent down and started to kiss me feverently. I kissed him back with equal amount of passion; in truth, I missed my red guy for far too long as well. His large hands pulled my closer; his right holding the back of my head while the left kept a firm grip on my back, nailing me to his strong, broad chest. My hands kept a firm hold on his jersey, clinging onto him as if it were my dying moment. I was doing everything in my power to keep my legs from buckling underneath me. We pulled apart briefly for some breath, our gaze meeting again. His eyes were half lidded and I know mine were as well. I snaked my arms up and wrapped them around his neck, pulling him back into another desperate kiss. He wrapped both his arms around my waist, pulling me closer to him, moaning at the feel of our bodies touching. This was pure bliss for the both of us and we knew it. Sadly, the peaceful moment had to end when we were both startled upon hearing a giggle followed by a male laugh echoing in the hall and then halting right in front of the bedroom door. Hearing the doorknob rattling then turning, Nawt and I pulled apart from one another, our faces flushed red. The door swung open and there was Bupkus standing with Marie in his arms. Marie giggled lightly then saw the both of us, making her squeal even more with delight. \"Kar-kar! Bunny!\" Bupkus looked up at us and apparently noticed the flushed looks on our faces. He gave a snide grin. \"Did we interrupt anything?\" Nawt averted his gaze, though his face looked the least amused. I shook my head, laughing bashfully. \"No! We were just discussing how hungry we were and that we were gonna go down to get something to eat, right Nawt?\" Nawt nodded in agreement, his countenance recovering from the blood rush. Bupkus didn't seem to buy it, but brushed it off. \"Riiight... If you say so, lovebirds. Ha ha!\" He walked away with Marie cooing in his arms, heading towards the stairs and we flinched as he hollered. \"You two might want to hurry if you want anything to eat!\" Nawt and I exchanged flustered looks and both of us laughed nervously. \"So, ready to go eat something?\" He nodded. \"Sure. I'm starving already, anyways.\" I was about to hit him with a throw pillow that was on the bed as he shot out the door cackling with glee. I shook my head while smiling happily. At least we're together again.. Meanwhile, looking down the window from high in a tree near the house, two piercing red eyes were glaring down at the romantic scene bitterly. Taking a large puff from his cigar, the evil slime green alien chuckled. \"Soon, my dear.. I'll be the one who will be enjoying you... very soon ...\" Then in a flash, the evil alien leaped out of the tree and dashed away into the darkness.[Chapter 10] I have Chapter 10. Should I give it over to you guys? Maybe. Okay, here you go! I own only Hale, Kari, and Marie. Time to kick the time frame up a bit, so yeah. Don't worry. It'll get good, I promise you! ;) For the next couple days, we were going to spend living with the Monstars, as well as having daily visits from some of the Tunes. Pound insisted that he had no problems cooking our meals and trying to meet up with our needs. Hale would constantly keep patrolling me just to make sure that I wasn't up to anything sneaky with Nawt, although he failed miserably, as Nawt and I had occasional make out sessions when no one was around. But eventually, they each were interrupted by either Bupkus and Marie or Blanko and Nada. Speaking of those two, I noticed that they have gotten far more closer to one another. I caught both of them on the second day of our staying in Looney Tune Land holding hands while walking around in the Monstars' back garden. I thought it was quite the most adorable sight that I have ever seen, though I avoided lingering for too long for fear of being noticed and embarrassing them, along with myself for peeping. As I was walking away from the couple, I ran right into Nawt. Big surprise? Not really. \"Hey, sweetheart. What ya doin'?\" I raised a finger up to my lips, telling him to keep down and pointed towards the bushes. He quietly peeked through and saw Blanko talking to Nada happily, the both of them laughing without a care in the world. \"Huh, well what do you know? Those two are just peachy together. Speaking of which..\" He swiftly made his way over to me and wrapped his long arms around me. I giggled lightly as he kissed the top of my head then rested his chin on it. \"Want to go shoot a few hoops? Just for fun, of course.\" I raised a brow. \"I thought you guys couldn't play without the NBA talents?\" Nawt shook his head. \"Nah. We sucked big time at first, yes, but we decided to adapt and build up our own talent. Trust me, we've gotten a whole lot better!\" I turned around in his arms, giving him a bemused smile. \"Alright. Show me what you can do.. babe.\" Nawt raised a brow, then bent down close to my ear, his hot breath tickling it. \"I should have you call me that more often.\" I laughed and gently pushed him away. \"Not unless you can beat me on a few rounds!\" We started making a mad dash towards the Monstars' private basketball court that was a couple yards away from the garden, unaware that Blanko and Nada already noticed us with grins on their faces. Third Person POV: Blanko and Nada were walking into the back garden of the Monstars' mansion. In the garden, there was a wide variety of flowers, fruits, and other vegetation. Nada walked up and noticed a couple of blue forget-me-nots arranged in a tidy row on the greenhouse shelf. \"Oh, wow! They're beautiful!\" She cried breathlessly, examining the petite blue bouquets. \"I've always wanted to see forget-me-nots up close. They're gorgeous!\" Blanko shuffled around shyly. \"I planted those. Normally, I'm the one who takes care of the garden and manages the plants around here.\" She turned around and faced him with an awestruck look. \"You? Oh, Blanko.. You did wonderfully! They look absolutely gorgeous! I can't believe how talented you are. It must have been a lot of work for you to make sure everything is running smoothly here.\" The tall blue alien chuckled airily. \"Thanks. I'm glad you like them. If you want, you can take some with you when you guys go back.\" The young girl gazed up with her bright green eyes, a happy light dancing in the orbs of her irises. \"You really mean it? I can have one?\" He nodded in confirmation, a faint blush rising up to his cheeks. He was then caught off by surprise as Nada jumped up and embraced him, squealing with delight. \"Oh, thank you! Thank you so much, Blanko! No one has ever given me flowers like these before! I promise I'll treasure them.. you know, they actually remind me of you.\" The blue giant snapped out of his goofy stupor and glanced down at the petite girl hugging him. \"Huh? Of me?\" Nada let go of him and nodded. \"Yeah, they're blue, just like you are.\" She grinned up brightly at him, her cheeks a bright pink. Blanko smiled back, his pulse beating a little faster than it normally would be. ' Guess I know now how Nawt feels when Kari acts like this with him.. Feels nice..', he thought to himself in wonderment. They both stood there gaping at each other wide mild blushes on their faces, smiling from ear to ear. Then a loud thundering shout was heard from the other end of the garden in the direction of the ginormous home. It was Pound, and he was calling for Blanko to help him out with some fresh tomatoes. \"Uh, I'll be back in a bit, okay? Just gotta go help Pound with something really quick. Feel free to look around here though.\" Nada nodded in small disappointment as Blanko took off to see what Pound wanted him to do with the tomatoes. 'I wish he didn't have to go, but I guess Pound does need his help pretty badly.. Wonder what they're gonna do with the tomatoes? Probably a salad or some salsa?' She thought to herself, wandering among the organized row of flowers. As she came across a nice little patch of lilies, she was started by some rustling in the small bushel row behind her. \"Hello? Who's there?\" Nada peeked over the small row, but saw nothing. She looked to her left then her right, shaking her head in confusion. \"That's really weird.\" As she turned around, she was caught by surprise as a large, slime green hand clamped over her mouth to keep her from screaming. The other large hand grabbed hold of her wrist, squeezing it painfully hard. Trying to wring herself free but to no avail, the large mysterious stranger chortled in a sinister manner. \"Well well, I was hoping to run into the other brat, but I guess you'll have to do.\" Nada's eyes shot up in terror at the looming figure above her. He was a lot taller than her, probably a bit shorter than Blanko by an inch. He was fuming a cigar in his mouth and had the most fierce, piercing red eyes she has ever seen in her life. What struck her the most was his massive, muscular figure. He must have noticed her terrifying gaze as he let out a boisterous chuckle. \"Am I better looking than your boyfriend?\" Nada shot him a glare, her eyes showing every bit of defiance at his words. He took out a deep puff from his cigar, shrugging. \"Probably not. But you're of no interest to me, oh no! Who I want... is your friend Kari . I'm sure she's told you already about me; only difference being is that I was pudgier back then than I am now.\" Her eyes grew wide at the realization of who was in front of her. 'No way..' The tall, muscular and sinister being who was stalking above her tiny form was none other than Swackhammer himself. He took another deep puff and blew it into her face, causing her to cough behind his huge hand. \"Ain't polite to stare, you brat. Haven't you been taught any manners? Anyway, I need you to do something for me.. that is.. if you want your boyfriend and all your friends to stay alive .\" Nada stilled at his words, tears threatening to burn from out of her eyes at the thought of what he would do to everyone; to Blanko. Knowing he got her full attention from the threat, he grinned evilly and bent down, whispering maniacally to her. \"I want you, as soon as you bunch return back to your world, to make sure Kari is isolated from everyone else. For all I care, she could be in her room for a moment; just a moment..\" Nada bit down hard on his pointer finger, causing him to yelp in pain. She fell to the floor, but was yanked up by both of her wrists, though not so hard as to leave bruises. \"Why should I? I would never do that! Kari is my friend, and so is everyone else! I'm not going to betray anyone!\" Swackhammer grimaced, but then flashed a large toothy grin. \"Because if you don't.. I will annihilate not just your friends, but your petty family too. You see, I know where your parents went and I know how to get 'em! It's not just mere coincidence that your beloved grandmother got sick out of the blue with influenza.\" She froze, her mind not believing what she was hearing. So he was the one who made all those occurrences rise out of nowhere? \"You're- you're lying! You wouldn't-\" She cried in shock. He growled darkly. \"Oh, but I would . Unless you do as I say..\" Seeing as she had no other option, she quietly nodded her head. Swackhammer seemed pleased with the response, lowering her down to the ground. \"Now no tears, girl. I don't want to attract attention.. at least, not just yet.\" Then he abruptly grabbed her harshly by the chin, forcing her to look up at him. \"If you say a word to anyone of this, I will do what I promised to do otherwise. Am I clear?\" Nada was shaking, knowing he meant business. She nodded her head, hoping that he would just leave; that it was all but a mere dream. Unfortunately for her, it wasn't. He breathed out a large puff from his cigar. \"Good girl. Remember, I want her alone.. and only her.\" Her eyes enlarged at his emphasis. 'Wait, only Kari? Not Hale? But why..?' Before she could utter a word, he was gone. Nada blinked a couple of times, looking around frantically for Swackhammer, but there was no sign of him anywhere. The smell of the cigar smoke also strangely disappeared, with only the smell of vegetation from the greenhouse. Falling to her knees, she wept lightly. \"Oh no.. please that it was just a dream. There was no way that he was just here.\" \"Are you okay, Nada?\" Halting her silent sobs, she glanced up to see Kari standing there, looking at her with concern. She wiped away the few tears that were on her face and gave a small smile at her friend. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just got a little scared, that's all.\" Kari tilted her head. \"Scared of what?\" Nada thought about telling her friend what just happened, but remembered the threat that came with it if she did. Still unsure if it was a dream or not, she thought against it and told her friend a white lie instead. \"That I saw a snake. I saw something moving around over there on the ground and I guess I freaked out.\" Kari gave her a small grin and shook her head. \"I'm sure it was nothing. Don't worry. Come on! Blanko made a nice Caesar salad for all of us for lunch!\" Kari offered her hand to her best friend to help her up. Smiling the best she could, Nada took her hand and the both of them walked out of the greenhouse and headed over to the large gazebo. Nada hated to tell lies, especially to those she loved. But she knew that if she told the truth, it would cost her dearly. From behind the tall trimmed pine trees that fenced around the backyard, Swackhammer grinned snidely to himself, as everything was going according to his plan.[Chapter 11] Time to roll out Chapter 11, along with some new faces in this story. I hope you all enjoy this so far! Gotta keep on trucking.. I own only the OC's that I have introduced originally since the first story (except for Nada Sampson, she belongs to MonstarzGirl). The past three days of staying in Looney Tune Land passed by quickly. We enjoyed our time staying with the Monstars, especially since I got to spend more time hanging out with Nawt. We did various activities, although I had to question Nada's behavior a few times. She was acting very nervous at some points, especially when I tried to go get something on my own in my room. She even insisted on staying over at our house for a while longer when we were heading back to our world. I wanted to ask her what was wrong, but she would brush it off like it was nothing. Witch Hazel, with the help of Wile and Bugs, finally put the finishing touches on my new mirror and took it to our house, giving it a home in my room. They managed to get rid of the pieces of the other mirror and dispose of them, which I was really grateful for. After bidding good bye to the Monstars for the time being and thanking for their hospitality, we grabbed our luggage and went through Nawt's mirror. We arrived inside of our home, feeling a tinge of relief like the energy that was previously here was no longer present. Setting down our bags, Nada and I began to empty the laundry out of them and took them to the washer machine that was down the hall. I separated the lights from the dark clothes and started up the machine with a cup of detergent. Nada shuffled her feet nervously on the wooden floorboards and I took notice of that. \"Nada, are you sure you're okay? You seem upset about something, and I doubt it was the snake you claimed to have seen in the garden a few days ago.\" Nada bit her lip and shook her head. \"It's nothing. I'm fine, Kari.\" \"No, you're not. I don't know what's got you all tied up in a knot, but friends shouldn't hide anything from one another.\" She turned to face me, giving me an angry look. \"I said I'm fine! Instead of worrying about me, you should worry about yourself!\" She kicked the pile of light clothes and then stormed off towards her room. I tried calling her name, but she slammed the door before I could say anything more. Knowing her, I sighed and left her be. She'll cool off by later in the afternoon. Thinking about what we were going to eat for dinner, I decided to check our fridge for provisions. I passed by Hale's room, noticing him lying on his bed playing with Marie. He was throwing her lightly up in the air, making her squeal with delight. \"Hey, bro.\" I grinned at the display. He caught Marie and turned his head towards me. \"Hey, sis. What's up?\" \"I need you to keep an eye on the clothes for me while I go see if we have any food available for dinner. Chances are I might have to go grocery shopping.\" My brother raised a curious brow. \"I thought Nada was helping you with the laundry?\" I shrugged. \"We got into a small argument and she's now locked inside her room. I won't take long.\" He sat up, placing Marie down on his bed next to him. \"Alright, I'll handle the laundry, but you're gonna fold it when you come back.\" I agreed to his condition and thanked him. He got up and handed me his debit card. \"Take this and make any purchases necessary. Just come back home before it gets dark out.\" Chuckling, I took his card and complied. \"Don't worry. I will.\" I took off and darted down the stairs towards the kitchen. I peeped quickly into the fridge and noticed that our supply of groceries was at a minimal. \"Grocery shopping it is, then.\" I grabbed Hale's car keys to his KIA along with my house keys and went out the door. It took only five to ten minutes till I arrived to the supermarket. Getting out of the car, I locked and put on the automated alarm then made my way through the parking lot. I guess I wasn't looking where I was going and bumped into someone. \"Oh! Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! I guess I wasn't- no way! Lexi?\" I glanced up and saw one of my friends from my photography class, Lexi Monroe. She had natural blonde hair and tan skin with the most brilliant sky blue eyes I have ever seen. Her hair was wavy but was put up in a ponytail and wore a purple top with ripped jeans and black flip flops. She had Asian chop sticks in her ponytail and dark purple goth earrings. In short, she's a model and one of the most attractive girls in our school, not to mention popular. \"Huh? Kari? Oh my gosh, it is you!\" She jumped at me and gave me a huge hug. I hugged her back and pulled back. \"I didn't expect to find you here! How are you?\" She shrugged. \"It's been good. Had a couple of photo shoots, but they were canceled. Something about 'bomb threats'.. speaking of which, did you hear that all the schools in the county have been closed?\" I nodded. \"Yeah, Hale, Nada and I got a message at our house about that.\" She looked at me with glee. \"Wait, Nada's with you guys? How is she.. and how come I'm hardly invited over at your place, huh?\" Lexi placed her hands on her hips, giving me a disapproving glare. \"Well, things have been complex lately, and-\" I was cut off as my blonde friend cried out. \"Complex nothing, hon! I'm coming along with you to your place after you get whatever you need from here!\" I gawked at her in shock. \"But- don't you have someplace to go? What about your car?\" She scoffed lightly. \"My parents dropped me off here cause there was a photographer that I was supposed to meet here. The guy called me at he last minute saying he lost all his equipment, so I was about to call my parents to come get me, until I bumped into you. Change of plans now. So I'll come along with you!\" \"Oh.. okay.. I guess.\" I mumbled, completely taken off guard by this notification. We started to make our stroll towards the market, talking about how things were going for the both of us during the school delay. I couldn't tell her about us reuniting with the Tunes or the Monstars. She wouldn't believe me, aside from her thinking that I'm a nutcase. Grabbing a shopping cart, we started getting the main essentials, like eggs, milk, butter, and such. I asked her if she could go get a box of linguine pasta, since I planned on making some spaghetti with meatballs for dinner. Lexi merrily complied and left to the pasta isle. As I was reaching up for a glass container of Ragu sauce, I heard someone dropping some cans from next to me. I glanced down and saw someone familiar. \"Dammit. Why do I keep dropping stuff everywhere?\" she mumbled. I bent down and helped her pick up the cans. \"Didn't expect to see you here, Maddie.\" Maddeline Stoner glanced up and her expression changed from frustrated to surprised and grateful. \"Kari? Oh, man! It's been a while, huh? What are you doing here?\" Maddie had wild brown hair that was trimmed in a scene fashion with chocolate brown eyes. She wore a green army camouflage long-sleeve with skinny jeans and black Vans. She always wore dark lens glasses, as she was a little sensitive to bright lights. She is also hardly ever seen without her purple Skull Candy ear-buds, jamming to her music. I picked up a can of mushrooms and smiled. \"I'm shopping for groceries. We hardly have anything in stock for dinner, so I came here to get a couple things. Lexi's helping.\" Her eyes almost boggled out from behind her glasses. \"No way. Lexi Monroe? She's here too? Where's Hale? I thought you guys were always together?\" I chuckled at her. \"He's at home watching our cousin with Nada, and-\" I was cut off for the second time today as she grabbed my arms wildly. \"Nada's hanging out with you too? Man, I feel left out! We've known each other since middle and you hardly invite me over! Well, forget my folks right now! I'm tagging along with you!\" I gaped at her with a wild expression. \"Wha-? But I already-\" \"Hey, Maddie! We could use some more people! Feel free to join us, alright!\" I turned around, seeing Lexi with three boxes of linguine pasta, smiling brightly. Maddie pumped her fists up in the air. \"Yes! Hey, why don't we have a sleepover at your place tonight? It's been forever since we had one!\" I was about to interject, but Lexi beat me to it. \"Great idea! I'm sure Kari wouldn't mind having a couple of girl friends over for a night, right Kari?\" Sighing in defeat, I hung my head and mumbled. \"Okay. I'll try to work something out with Hale.\" The two girls cheered, giving each other high fives. As we were about to finish up our round of grocery hunting, a ball rolled over in our direction. Lexi picked it up with a questionable look, until she heard a voice call up. \"Hey, that's my brother's ball.\" We looked up and saw, yet, another friend of ours. Mika Palmer was racing up to us, but came to a halt as she took a quick glance at our faces. \"Hey, guys! Didn't expect to see you bunch here! What are you guys doin'? Catching up on the times?\" Maddie waved happily at the dark skinned girl. \"Hey, Mika! We're just helping Kari get some groceries then we'll be heading our way over to her place for a sleepover!\" Mika Palmer is one of my bestest friends of all time. She's African-American and had lighter skin than most black people. She has light honey eyes and her hair is braided in dreads, tied all into one large ponytail. She has a piercing on the top cartilage of her left ear and was wearing a light blue top with denim shorts and white and silver Air Jordan's. With her, you can trust any secret and she'll take with her to the grave. \"Nu-uh! Why didn't I get invited? I thought we were besties, Kari.. but.. I guess I was wrong..\" She gave a melodramatic sigh, throwing her arm over her eyes. \"It's alright.. I'll live..\" I rolled my eyes and gave a small laugh. \"Alright, you can join us. But no more people! It's already a crowd back at home!\" Mika whooped with joy. \"Cool! I'll go tell my folks and get my stuff back at home. I'll see you at your place tonight!\" We all waved her bye for the time being, as we lined up to check out. After checking out, we loaded the groceries and got into my brother's car. We made a couple of quick stops along the way: one for gasolene and the others for Maddie and Lexi to get their stuff together. After we got their stuff and their parent's approval, we made a drive back to my home. I parked into the driveway, and noticed Hale was outside, talking to Mika who arrived earlier than expected. Getting out of the car, Hale looked over at me with a look saying 'we need to talk about this later'. I chuckled in embarrassment as Lexi and Maddie were helping with unloading the groceries. Hale saw them and gave me a bewildered look. I walked up to him as Mika went into the house, greeting Nada and Marie as she made her way in. Hale gawked at the girls, then back at me. \"You can't be serious! You invited all of them?\" I shrugged defensively. \"They wouldn't drop it! I couldn't help it!\" Hale squeezed his eyes with his fingers, letting out an annoyed sigh. \"Fine, but anymore of you females running around here, and I'll-\" He was cut off, speaking far too soon. \"Hey! Hale!\" We glanced over to our left and noticed someone walking up to us from the sidewalk near our driveway. One other friend, this time a friend of mine and Hale's since we were kids. She had a short bob haircut with a sky blue ribbon headband and pink pearl earrings. Her hair was a light honey brown color and had light brown eyes with fair skin. She wore a nice sunflower yellow tunic and a pink skirt with yellow flip flops. Her name is Elise Haywood, and for a long time now, she seems to have a crush on my brother, though she never said a word to him about it. \"Hey there, Elise! It's been a while, huh?\" I waved at her merrily. Hale stiffened slightly, though I didn't pay much attention to him. \"Oh, I was just taking an evening stroll around the neighborhood, until I saw the whole lot of you out here. What's going on? Is it a party?\" I gave her a grin. \"It's a sleepover. Want to join?\" Hale jerked his head over at me with a glare and his face flushing. \"Sure! I hope it's not a bother. Just let me tell my parents and I'll go get my stuff.\" With that said, she scampered off with a skip in her steps. I could tell she was happy about it, and hopefully she could muster the courage needed to get closer to my brother. Speaking of brothers, I glanced up at Hale, who looked like he was about to blow off steam from his ears. \"Kari, no more invites. You heard what dad said, remember? We can't just invite people out of the blue into our home while they're gone!\" I stuck my tongue out at him. \"Relax, would you? Besides, this will be a great opportunity for you to get to know Elise more!\" I left with a cocky grin as I left him standing there, flushing like a bright red tomato. As I made my way into the house and towards the kitchen, I noticed that all the groceries were put away, thanks to Nada and Mika. Mika has been in my house a couple times in the past, so she knew her way as much as Nada did. I thanked the both of them for their help, getting a smile from Mika and a nod from Nada. Nada walked up to me and hugged me with an apology for bursting out like she did earlier. I hugged her back, accepting her apology and forgave her. Moments later, Hale walked into the house with Elise next to him, carrying her bag in tow. She insisted bashfully that she could carry it, but he told her that he didn't mind doing the favor. She flushed faintly as he went up to take her bag into the bedroom where Marie slept in. After an hour, all of us were chatting happily as we ate my homemade spaghetti and meatballs with fresh rolls that I heated up from the miniature oven. Placing all the dirty dishes into the dishwasher and setting it to wash, we all gathered up for a movie. I went upstairs to fold the clothes, but when I arrived to the laundry room, I found all the clothes neatly fluffed and folded in place. On the top of my pile of clothes, I found a note; it was from Nada. I picked it up and read it to myself. ' Kari, I'm sorry for getting off on you like I did. I really can't say what's bugging me, but I'll do my best to keep my head up. Thanks for being there and worrying about me. I folded the clothes when Hale told me you left to get groceries. I hope this makes up for earlier. Nada' I smiled at her kind notion. She's a real friend, that's for sure. 'I just hope she's okay though.. I wish she would tell me what's wrong.' I picked up my pile of clothes and took them over to my room to put them away. Hearing someone at my doorway, I turned to see Lexi standing there. \"Need any help?\" I shook my head. \"No, it's okay. Just some clothes that I wore for the past few days.\" \"You make it sound like you guys left somewhere. Where did you go?\" She gave me a curious glance, raising a well groomed brow. I looked back at my pile of clothes, picking up the undergarments and went to put them away in my drawer. \"If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.\" Lexi looked surprised by that and walked over. \"Come on, I know you're not one to beat around the bush. Try me.\" Just as the proof and answer I needed received its cue, Bugs poked his head out of the mirror, along with Daffy's and Nawt's. Lexi let out a short scream, falling back onto my bed. \"What the hell!\" Bugs greeted me with a grin then glanced over at Lexi. \"Eh, sorry about that. Did we come at a bad time, Kari?\" I shook my head and greeted Nawt and Daffy, who greeted back happily, as well as Lexi. Lexi sat there stunned, her eyes now twice as big. Then I wondered about something and looked over at Bugs. \"Hold on, what are you guys doing here? Not to be rude, but this is a surprise to see you bunch here!\" Bugs stepped out of the mirror and into my room. Nawt and Daffy mimicked his movements and followed suit. \"Eh, your brother invited us over for a movie. We already ate dinner, so you don't need to feed any of us. We ate over at Nawt's place just a moment ago.\" Nawt walked over to me and pulled me up in an embrace and a kiss on the cheek. \"Sorry we didn't tell you. We thought Hale would have said something to you.\" I scowled. \"No, he didn't. I was off buying groceries. Who else is coming?\" Daffy smoothed his glossy black feathers. \"Practically everyone. Why?\" I mentally face palmed, wanting to choke Hale for bothering to lecture me about inviting people over when he's invited half of Looney Tune Land over for a movie! Lexi got up, still keeping her eyes on the people in the room with us. \"Whoa.. You're Bugs Bunny!\" Bugs turned to face her and raised a brow. \"The one and only. And what's your name, miss?\" She knocked herself out of her stupor and glanced over at me with bewilderment and excitement. I nodded to confirm her thoughts. She looked back and cleared her throat. \"My name's Lexi. Lexi Monroe. I'm a friend of Kari and Hale's.\" Bugs walked over and shook her hand. \"Pleased to meet ya, Lexi. A friend of Kari and Hale's is a friend of ours!\" We heard the sound of rushing footsteps running up towards my room and saw everyone else at my doorway with awestruck features. \"Nu-uh! This for real?\" cried Mika, her eyes flickering from each of us. Maddie took off her glasses and cleaned then with the rim of her shirt then placed them back on, gawking at the bunch of us. Elise let out a tiny cry, unable to grasp what she was seeing in front of her. Hale saw the ticked off look I was giving him and he grinned bashfully, rubbing the back of his head. 'This is going to be a long evening..' Hale and I soon began explaining to the girls what happened six years back, just like we did with Nada, and then told them of the current situation as it stands. All of them wore amused and shocked looks, switching glances every now and then with the two Tunes and Monstar that was standing with us in my room. After we finished explaining, they were still in a stupor, but were alright nonetheless. Bugs then put in, shuffling over. \"I hope you kids don't mind, but I should go get the others and bring 'em over before they throw a fit. I'll be back in a few, okay?\" We nodded as he jumped into the mirror to fetch the rest of the gang. We all decided to go downstairs to wait for everyone's arrival. Nawt glanced over at the girls then looked back at me, an idea formulating into his mind. I took note of it and nudged him gently. \"What are you thinking about?\" He grinned. \"I think you're friends should meet mine, don't you think?\" I took a moment to process what he meant, and giggled. \"Good idea. But let's leave Elise out of it.\" He gave me a questionable look. \"Who's Elise?\" I pointed to the girl next to Hale with the blue ribbons in her hair. \"She's interested in my brother, and I'm trying to get them paired up; not only cause they look cute together, but so he'll get off my back every time he sees us together.\" Nawt chuckled and pecked my cheek. \"I wouldn't worry so much about that, love. He'll get over it.\" I drew myself closer to his being as he wrapped a muscular arm around me. After waiting for a good five minutes or so, Bugs emerged downstairs with everyone else in tow. The Monstars walked in, Bupkus looking around for Marie. Nada walked up to him and handed the toddler over to him, who cooed with joy at the sight of her favorite alien. Bupkus took her with a bright smile, tickling the tiny tot's nose gently. He froze, however, when he looked up and saw Lexi, who was also looking at him with a wondrous expression. Nada joined up with Blanko and the pair took a seat on one of the sofas. The same went with Bang, as he was gazing over at Maddie, who was jamming to her music from her iPod. The large green alien walked over and cleared his throat to gain her attention. \"Uh, mind if I sit next to you?\" Maddie glanced up momentarily, then took a double take at the giant before her. \"Uh.. Sure. No problem. Sit here.\" She patted the space next to her and he gratefully took a seat next to her. They both then started a conversation about what she was listening to, and surprisingly, they shared the same tastes in music! Nawt and I exchanged knowing glances with one another and smiled. I turned to look over at Pound, who was already making himself comfortable with Mika, the two talking over about what movie they should watch, although they kept agreeing on the same ones, which were ones they liked. 'I think this is going to be an interesting night for all of us..' Glancing over at Hale, I noticed he was showing off his old Tune Squad uniform that he wore the night of the Ultimate Game to Elise, who was marveling the piece of clothing with awe. The Tunes were chatting among one another merrily, and some were joining in conversations with the Monstars and the girls. Daffy and Sly were over with Bupkus, Marie, and Lexi enjoying a very interesting conversation about what can fall faster from a sixty foot building, a watermelon or a bowling ball. Nada and Blanko were laughing as they were listening to Yosemite, Foghorn, Taz, Barnyard Dog and Elmer talking about what hunting season is in and the kinds of caliber Yosemite and Elmer used for them. They eventually ended up in a boastful competition of which one was the best hunter. Pound, Mika, Lola and Bugs were debating on the variety of movies there were in option for watching, as well as what would be the most suited for everyone as a general audience (remember that Marie is still a little kid, so no scary movies). On the opposite end, Hale, Elise, Wile, Roadrunner, Witch Hazel and Tweety were laughing about something or other, mostly about Wile never being able to catch up to Roadrunner, no matter how hard or how many times he tried. Wile gave a dirty look at Tweety who was laughing the most, certainly not amused by the least. I took a seat with Nawt as the both of us talked about the possible pairing working out and just how my brother had the gall to give me a complaint about me inviting the girls when he invited more people than I could count. He laughed merrily at the subject and pulled me close. After finally choosing a movie, everyone settled down on the chairs and sofas, and some sat on the carpet as we played the film. I relaxed in Nawt's arm, feeling content at this wonderful moment that everyone is having. For once, everyone wasn't worrying and were at peace. But for how long will it last? I shook that worried thought out of my head, enjoying the movie with all my loved ones.[Chapter 12] Alas, Chapter 12. Nada Sampson is fully credited to MonstarzGirl. Hale, Kari, Marie, and the other girls are mine to mix and mold to my desire. Oh, the drama.. the suspense.! I'll let you read now. By around eleven, we finished watching up to two movies: Coraline and Taken, which were two favorite movies of mine and Hale's. The Tunes thanked us for the movies and made their way up the stairs towards my room so they can use the mirror to return home. The Monstars also bade us farewell, most of them slightly disappointed of leaving after just meeting the girls. I laughed and told them that we would be more than happy to pay them a visit tomorrow, seeing as how school is completely canceled for the time being. They seemed to like the idea, even the girls! Lexi said her goodbyes to Bupkus, taking a sleeping Marie out of his arms, carefully as not to wake her. Maddie and Bang said goodbye to one another too; as it turns out she shared one of her ear-buds with him and let him listen to one of her favorite songs while everyone else was taking their leave. Pound waved shyly at Mika, who smiled and waved back, excited about seeing them again tomorrow. Blanko hugged Nada goodbye, whispering something sweet in her ear, then pulled back with a kiss to her forehead. She giggled and kissed him back on the cheek. I felt my heart warm up to the two of them being happy with one anothers presence. Nawt sauntered over and pulled me in for a hug and a savoring kiss to the lips. After a moment, we pulled back, grinning from ear to ear. He leaned closed to me and rubbed his nose on mine. \"See you tomorrow, okay?\" I nodded and let him go as he went to catch up with the other Monstars towards my mirror. After everyone left through my mirror, the rest of us decided to call it quits for the night. Hale left to go shower quickly and went straight to bed. Lexi helped me tuck Marie to bed while the rest of the girls got into their pajamas. Once I was sure Marie was fine in her room, I walked out, running into Nada right at the door. \"Oh, hey there Kari. Great evening, huh?\" I smiled at her in agreement. \"Yeah, it was! I'm glad everyone could get together and enjoy some time with one another. I think we all needed it, what with Swackhammer running about.. you okay?\" I noticed her face slightly paled at the mention of Swackhammer. Then I realized that's what was bothering her. \"Oh. So that's what's bugging you as of late. Why didn't you say so?\" Nada shifted around uncomfortably. \"Well, I- uh-\" I placed my hand on her shoulder, assuring her. \"Look, don't worry about it. I doubt that pig will do anything to hurt us. Besides, we're a team! And now that the Monstars are free of his hold, he doesn't stand a chance against any of us. Trust me.\" She glanced up at me with a hopeful expression. \"Do you really think so?\" I nodded, grinning a huge grin. \"Positive! Now why don't you get some shut eye? You look like you could need it.\" She nodded and bade me goodnight. I did the same and headed towards my room. Reaching my door, I saw Maddie walk out with a curious look. \"Is Nada okay?\" I waved my hand at her. \"She's fine. I think she's just worried about what's going on with the issue about Swackhammer.\" Maddie raised her brows. \"So that's it? I don't blame her. The guy sounds like a real asshole. I'll go keep her company tonight. I doubt she'll be able to sleep without someone else other than your baby cousin.\" I smiled in appreciation. \"Thanks! I'm sure she would like that.\" Maddie took her stuff and headed off to the room where Nada and Marie were sleeping in. Stepping inside my room, I sat on the bed with Lexi, Mika and Elise. Mika glanced at me with a serious look. \"This Swackhammer guy sounds like real trouble, huh? Girl, I think you need to give that guy a serious ass whoopin'.\" Lexi snorted. \"Leave me out of it. Sounds like a nasty guy enough as it is, and I don't want a piece of his ass on my foot.\" Mika gave a sly smile. \"No, but I know whose ass you really want a piece of! I saw how you and that purple muscle machine were flirting. He was certainly all over you!\" Lexi flushed at her crude remark. \"It's not like that! I mean- I'm just- We're just getting to know each other, that's all!\" Mika let out a scoff. \"Right, and I'm cupid ready to fly high to the moon where the plate and the spoon are busy spoonin'. Don't kid around, Lex. We all know you are one of the most popular girls at our high school and practically every guy there doesn't interest you the slightest! But this guy-\" \"Bupkus. His name is Bupkus.\" Lexi interjected, hugging her pillow as a storm of red flooded her cheeks. \"See? You're as red as a cherry! Girl, you have a thing fo' him. Just admit it!\" Mika dodged as Lexi threw a throw pillow in her direction, hitting the head board of my bed instead. \"Well, what about you and the orange? You guys were hitting it off just fine too!\" Mika looked away, her eyes shifting here and there nervously. \"His name's Pound, and fo' your information, we were just having friendly conversation, that's all.\" Lexi raised a cocky brow, a smirk playing on her face. \"Guess I'm not the only one who's crushing here, huh?\" Mika then turned to look at her, a keen smile appearing on her lips. \"Nada seems to like that Blanko guy. They seem really cute together.\" I laughed, joining in their conversation. \"Trust me, she's got him wrapped around her pinky. I can tell; Nada and Blanko are so meant for each other! It's practically adorable!\" Elise perked her head up and glanced at me shyly. \"What about you, Kari? You and the red guy are really close; you guys even kissed like it was nothing!\" Lexi and Mika were aroused with interest at this mention and poked in. \"Yeah, hon. You two are like a couple; holding hands, kissing, snuggling and all that.\" Mika leered with a cheeky grin. \"Someone's definitely in love! His name's Nawt, right? Since when did you two hit it off?\" I shyly rubbed the back of my head, chuckling nervously. \"Well, we liked each other for about six years now.\" The girls almost fell off from the bed in utter shock. Lexi gabbed hold of the edge of the bed to keep from falling completely off. \"S-six years? The hell? But then that means you guys were off the bat when you were only ten!\" Mika swallowed on some saliva that she nearly choked on and muttered. \"I hope he ain't no pedo.\" I blushed furiously at her crude comment. \"He's not a pedophile! Yeah, he was probably older than I was then and probably still is now, but I really do care for him and he does me! Besides, in Looney Tune Land, Bugs said they can't age, since the aging process doesn't exist there.\" Lexi thought aloud in wonder. \"You don't age there, huh? Sounds like the Fountain of Youth legend.\" Mika turned her attention towards Elise, now aiming her merciless slew of comments and pointers at her. \"What about you, Bo Peep? You're the only one who ain't paired with a Monstar. Wait, what about that green guy?\" I interjected. \"That's Bang, and he seems already interested in Maddie as it is.\" Lexi grinned. \"Yeah, those two had absolutely no problems getting along! She was eager to have his company, too!\" Elise blushed two shades of red, her eyes gazing down at the carpet while hugging one of my throw pillows. \"Well, um, I like Hale. Kari even knows that.\" Mika squealed a little too loudly. I had to signal her to keep it down, as some people in the house were already asleep. \"Oh, sorry. But wow, girl. Imagine, if you and Hale hit it off.. who knows! Maybe someday you'll be Kari's sister-in-law or something like that.\" Elise flushed even deeper at the thought. \"Huh? No- I mean yes- I mean, don't you think it's too soon to think about such things like that? Who knows if Hale and I will end up together? Besides, I have no clue if he likes me back or not..\" We all murmured among one another, understanding what she meant. I knew, cause I had the same problem back when I saw Nawt again after he became a Monstar. \"Well, I'm sure you'll find out sooner or later. Right now, I think we should all get some shut eye. We're gonna need the beauty sleep if we're gonna go to Looney Tune Land tomorrow.\" I calmly told her. She glanced up and gave a shy smile, nodding her head. We all tucked ourselves in, the girls with their individual sleeping bags. Turning off the light and bidding everyone a good night, I couldn't help but feel that tomorrow, something was about to happen... Something that definitely wasn't good. Not at all.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13.. yes.. quite... like a sir. You know the drill. Now.. time for the real action to commence! Feeling a little warm under my covers, I woke up with grogginess fogging up my vision. Lexi, Mika, and Elise were still asleep, so I decided to take the liberty of showering a little earlier than usual. Getting a yellow shirt with magenta flowers printed vertically on it, a pair of jean shorts, and some clean undergarments, I sauntered over to my bathroom, allowing me to shower before anyone else woke up. After lathering and rinsing off, I dried up and dressed into my attire for the day. As soon as I crept out of the bathroom, I heard a wail coming from down the hall. I opened the door and noticed it was coming from Marie's room. Heading in that direction and opening her door, I walked over to her crib. Her wailing seemed to have woken up Nada and Maddie, as they began to stir and mumble. \"'Huh, what time is it? Is it school time already?\" Maddie rubbed her eyes, looking over with a sleepy expression towards me and Marie. I shook my head and told them no, then turned my attention towards Marie. After examining her for a few moments, I figured that she wasn't hungry nor anything else of natural calling. I had a hunch, so I carefully placed a hand on her tiny forehead. It was just as I thought. 'Bingo. The poor thing has a fever. But this early in the year..?' Nada got up and walked over to see the two year old along with me. \"So what's wrong with her?\" I frowned slightly, shaking my head. \"She's got a fever.\" \"A fever? How the heck can she get a fever overnight?\" We turned around to see Mika standing at the doorway, along with Lexi and Elise. Elise bit her lip worryingly. \"Oh, poor Marie. I wonder how she got sick?\" Lexi tilted her head. \"That's kinda weird. Just how did she get sick that quickly? She was perfectly fine last night!\" Maddie got up from the bed and joined me and Nada. \"Should we take her to the doctors?\" I shook my head. \"It's not gonna help. She got this fever overnight, and having it early in the year right now? Doesn't make sense. Maybe when going to see the Tunes, you guys could bring Witch Hazel over so she can examine her over. Maybe she might be able to find a cure.\" Nada snapped her immediate attention towards me, looking somewhat petrified at the idea. \"You mean, you're not coming?\" I lifted Marie up, wrapping her gently in her blanket. \"No, I think I should stay here with Marie. She shouldn't get out of the house in this condition, even if it's just a trip through the mirror.\" \"What's all the racket over here? Is Marie okay?\" We all turned around to see Hale standing in the hallway behind Mika, Lexi, and Elise. Walking up to my brother, I gave a concerned look. \"Marie seems to have gone down with something. Hale, would you mind going to Looney Tune Land and get Witch Hazel? You can take Nada and the others with you.\" Hale almost fell back, completely shell shocked. \"W-what? No way! I'm not letting you stay here by yourself!\" Nada nodded her head in agreement, stepping up to the two. \"He's right, Kari. One of us should stay behind with you and-\" \"I'll do it.\" Everyone, including me, turned to face Elise. Hale raised a brow. \"Elise? You sure?\" She smiled shyly, her eyes dancing with a determined light. \"If it's okay with you, Hale; I don't mind helping your sister out with taking care of Marie. I've known you both since we were little kids, so it would seem a bit more comforting for your thoughts..\" After what seemed like a good minute, Hale sighed and raised a hand in approval. \"Okay. You can stay and help Kari take care of Marie. At least it will be you two together and not one person with a toddler.\" I smiled and gave a gesture of thanks towards Elise, who chuckled happily. I noticed Nada was still a little tense, so I wanted to give her some reassurance. \"Don't worry, Nada. I'll be fine holding down the fort here with Elise. You and Hale just go with the others and get Witch Hazel then come back as soon as possible.\" I pulled out my cell phone and was surprised to find that the battery was almost dead, as it was down to one meter. \"Looks like I need to go charge my cell phone. Elise, is your phone on you?\" Elise pulled out her cell, a little orange cat charm hanging off it. \"Yep, and don't worry, it's fully charged, so Hale can contact us through mine.\" Hale nodded. \"Okay, so that's the plan then. Get ready and dressed girls, we're going for a quick stop to Looney Tune Land!\" Everyone left to get themselves dressed. Elise and Mika used my bathroom to clean themselves up, while Maddie, Lexi and Nada used the bathroom in the hallway, which had an extra shower in it. Hale was out from dressing up and helped me to fix up the breakfast for everyone. Once the other girls were done getting ready, they emerged down the stairs and arrived into the kitchen. We all had scrambled eggs with toast, cinnamon oatmeal, orange juice and croissants. Once the breakfast had been finished up, Hale gathered everyone up in front of my mirror, ready to depart to Looney Tune Land. \"Okay, is everyone set?\" He glances over at everyone to see if they're prepared. The girls cheered in confirmation, except for Nada, who gave a nervous smile. \"You sure you'll be okay by yourselves, Kari?\" I gave him a warm smile. \"Trust me, we'll be fine. Just go get Witch Hazel as quickly as possible and come straight back, okay? Elise will help me take care of Marie.\" Giving an uncertain look but then shrugged it off, my brother wished us good luck and stepped through the mirror. Lexi then stepped in through it, followed by Mika and Maddie. Nada turned to face me, still unsure by us being alone. \"Kari, are you sure-?\" I nodded again. \"Yeah, I'm positive. Just go along with the others! If anything, we'll call Hale.\" Looking as if she was thinking it over, Nada nodded her head and then stepped into the mirror herself. Now that everyone left, I asked Elise if she could take Marie downstairs and give her some apple juice while I went to go charge my cell phone. Taking the coughing and sneezing toddler, she left out of my room and into the hallway towards the stairs. As I went to go grab my cell phone charger, I noticed that I didn't have the bracelet that Nawt gave me on my wrist. Ignoring the dying tone my cell phone was making, I went to my night-table and noticed that the bracelet wasn't there where I normally left it. Getting frustrated, I placed down my cell phone on the bed and opened the drawer, in hopes of finding it in there. What I failed to also notice, was the silent footsteps that made their way down the hall and entering my room. About to close the drawer in agitation, I heard a deep snarl coming from right behind me, with an all too familiar voice, like it came from a nightmare. \"Hello, Kari.. Looking for something?\" I turned around to see my bracelet in the nasty and grimy hands of the brute who we've blown away six years ago. I couldn't believe my eyes at what's in front of me. He started making his way towards me, and I did the only thing that snapped into my mind. I screamed. Third Person POV: Elise left Kari's room and headed down the stairs with the tiny tot in her arms. The poor child was throwing a coughing fit, whimpering at the misery of having a fever. The older girl tried to calm her little cries. \"There, there now. It'll be alright. Hale and the others will be back soon with Witch Hazel and you'll be good as new! Now let's get you some juice, shall we?\" As the went to the pantry and pulled out a spill-proof cup, she instantly jolted and dropped it when she heard a piercing scream coming from upstairs. Marie jumped slightly and began to whimper even more. Elise cooed the child to stay quiet as she looked up towards he staircase. She gasped with some fear in her trembling voice. \"Oh no. Kari!\" She held on to the little child as she stealthily sprinted up the stairs, and looked over to Kari's door, where it was left ajar. Creeping up as quietly as she could, she peeked into the slightly opened door and was shocked at what she saw. A giant, olive green alien with a nasty stench of cigars and the most frightening red eyes she has ever seen, grabbed Kari and threw her down onto the floor. She retaliated and kicked him hard on the shin, casing him to almost double over. Getting up, she snatched her bracelet from his hand and was about to make a get away. Unfortunately, he reacted just as quickly and snatched his large hand around her left ankle, causing her to trip down onto the floor. As she hit the floor, Kari lost a hold of her bracelet as it flew out of her hand and slid behind her mirror. Elise couldn't help but watch in horror as her friend was getting thrashed around like a rag doll, although she was trying to put up a good fight. Getting back onto his feet, the aggressive alien backhanded Kari across the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. Now fearing for hers, Marie's and Kari's lives, she quickly made her way down the hall and into the room where Marie slept in. She closed the door and placed the lock on it. She sat on the bed, unsure of what to do next. From the other room, Swackhammer heard the light footsteps and growled. \"Looks like there's someone else here besides the brat. Guess I should go give them a proper greeting.\" He grabbed the unconscious tomboy and held her under his arm, making his way out of the room to see who else was in the house. Hearing the thunderous foot steps, Elise began to panic. Calming herself down as much as she could, she picked Marie up in her arms while she was still wrapped in her blanket and dove into the closet. Closing it firmly, she pulled out her cell phone from her jean pockets and began to dial Hale's number. Meanwhile, in Looney Tune Land, Hale arrived with the girls in the gymnasium, where the Monstars and Tunes were busy playing a couple rounds of basketball and were waiting for the kids to show up. Bugs heard the doors open and everyone turned to see the teens entering. \"Hey there, docs! Where's Kari, Elise and the tyke at?\" Hale gave a concerned look. \"Marie's caught a pretty bad flu.\" Bupkus raised his head in alarm. \"My poor little Marie's sick! Did you take her to a doctor?\" Lexi shook her head. \"Kari insisted that it wouldn't be necessary. She also thinks that it's not a normal flu.\" Mika shook her head. \"But it's true. How can a little healthy girl get a bad flu overnight? It ain't even flu season yet!\" Pound raised a brow. \"Maybe it's a perk?\" Nawt gave a slightly disappointed look at the fact that Kari stayed behind, but he knew it was for the sake of her little cousin. \"So I assume Elise is with her?\" Nada nodded her head, giving a greeting to Blanko. Blanko seemed to have noticed the uneasiness on her features and put a hand on her shoulder in concern. \"What's wrong, Nada? You seem upset about something.\" Bugs and the others took note of that too. Hale approached his sister's friend with a dubious look. \"Nada, you've been acting really strange lately. It's pretty obvious that there's something eating you. What's going on?\" Nada grew uncomfortable that all eyes were on her. However, she knew she had to come clean. Taking a deep shaky sigh, she looked up at Hale and the rest of them head on. \"The second day we were spending staying here, when Blanko left to help Pound with the salad, I saw.. I saw..\" Blanko didn't like where this was going, but encouraged her to continue. \"What did you see, Nada?\" Hale slightly clenched his jaw apprehensively, but maintained level. Nada couldn't help but start to cry softly, barely whispering. \"I saw Swackhammer. He was there, in the greenhouse with me.\" Everyone let out shocked gasps and murmurs. Hale became alarmed and so did the Monstars. The girls shifted around nervously, but listened on, for there was more to be heard. Hale calmly egged Nada on. \"What happened? What did Swackhammer do?\" Blanko gave a worried look of his own. \"He didn't hurt you, did he?\" She shook her head, trying to hold back her sobs. \"He threatened.. he said he would hurt all of you guys.. and my family.. if I didn't..\" Hale began to tense up, feeling his blood boil. Blanko coaxed her to calm down. Nada swallowed hard and squeezed her eyes shut, crying out the last part of her sentence. \"He told me he would hurt everyone if I didn't do as he says!\" Bugs stepped in, a deeply concerned look etched into his features. \"What did he tell you to do, Nada? It's okay, we won't get mad at ya.\" Nada finished off before breaking down in sobs. \"He wanted me to make sure Kari was by herself! That's why I was so insistent on being near her or at least having someone with her!\" Hale clenched his fists, his nostrils flaring. Lexi stepped up behind Nada and hushed the poor girl's relentless sobs. \"There, there. He won't get near her. Besides, Elise and Marie are with her, so there's nothing to worry about. You did what you thought was right.\" Blanko held Nada close, rubbing the side of her arm gently. Suddenly, a jingle was heard echoing throughout the gym, startling everyone. Hale reached into his pocket and grabbed his cell phone. His eyes widen at Elise's name appearing on the screen. \"It's Elise.\" Mika cried aloud. \"Put her on speaker phone. I wanna holler at my home girls and the baby cakes!\" Chuckling a bit, Hale pressed talk, followed by the speaker phone button. Bugs and Pound hushed everyone down so Hale could hear what Elise was going to say. \"Hey, Elise. Is everything okay?\" \"Hale! You guys have to come back here now!\" Her voice sounded frantic, like she was in some sort of trouble. This alarmed everyone slightly, and Hale felt unnerved at her reaction. \"What's going on, Elise? Is something wrong?\" Elise cried out. \"No! Hale, you have to come back! Kari is-\" Hale was now fully alarmed at hearing his sister's name. Nawt raised his ears in alarm as well, his eyes widening with anxiety. Nada silenced her sobs, her eyes staring at Hale's phone in fear and realization. \"Oh no...\" \"What happened to Kari? Elise? Elise!\" He heard nothing but silence. Before he could say anything, a loud scream was heard from the phone, then silence again. All the Tunes were exchanging frightened glances with one another. Nawt was next to Hale in an instant, trying to maintain his calm. Moments later, there was a response; one that sent chills of terror in everyone's spine, especially Nada's, Nawt's, and Hale's. \"If you ever wish to see your precious girlfriend, the little brat , and your sister... then I dare you to come and find me. Good luck, boy..\" A loud, shrill cackle was heard from the phone's speaker before the line went dead. Hale couldn't believe his ears. \"No.. Kari!\" Without another word, Hale bolted in the direction of the mirror that was sitting near the gym wall and jumped through it. Everyone else, Tunes, Monstars and girls alike followed him in tow. Hale landed in his sister's room and looked around in horror. His sister's room was a total mess, like there was sign of a struggle. Frantic, he raced out of the door and looked around wildly. He caught sight of Marie's door wide open and bolted into there. To his shocked discovery, the closet door was ripped off it's hinges and the door broken in half. Looking down, he saw Elise's phone in two pieces and Marie's favorite stuffed bear. Nawt was the second one to fly out of the mirror, followed by Bugs and then the rest. Everyone glanced around in utter disbelief and horror at the room's condition. Nawt walked around the room, completely stunned at the sight. As he looked back towards the others, something bright caught his eye from under the mirror. Kneeling down, his eyes grew wide at the object; it was the bracelet he gave to Kari. Picking it up, he felt his blood boil and his face contorted with rage. \"Damn you, Swackhammer.\" Hale arrived back into the room, where everyone glanced at him with worried faces. As soon as they saw the murderous look he had on his face, a lot of them stepped back. Nawt got up and faced Hale, his anger not subsiding in the least. Hale glared out towards the window, his teeth bared. Nada brought herself closer to Blanko, feeling completely at loss. \"So what now Hale?\" Hale turned to face the lot, his eyes meeting Nawt's. In that moment, as if they just knew what the other was thinking, they nodded at one another. Hale then pounded his right fist into his left hand, the chip on his shoulder finally bursting. \"The one thing we can do: go get that son of a bitch, send him to hell where he belongs, and get my cousin, Elise, and my sister back!\"[Chapter 14] The last chapter got everyone in a jumble, I bet. ;3 Well, this one may be a tad bit short. Maybe not. I'll see how far I can get. It's still early, and Slenderman is stalking me in my sleep. Mofo ain't gonna get me, not even for my bag of bacon that I got from Bacon Island. I own only my bag of bacon, as well as the OC's that I originally created. Nada belongs to MonstarzGirl. Elise's POV: 'Ouch... My head hurts.. Why does the floor feel so cold? Wait, where's Marie and Kari?' I shifted around, coming to from being unconscious. I heard some babbling and gibberish coming from the other end of the cold room where I was, and lifted my head to see who it was. To my relief, I saw Marie sitting in the far corner, playing with her blanket happily. She started to sneeze a little bit, still feeling her fuzzy and warm purple blanket. Lifting myself up from the metal floor, I crawled over to the small girl, who sneezed then giggled when she saw me up and about. \"Eli!\" I smiled with comfort as I scooped her up into my arms, knowing I wasn't by myself here. Holding her close, I examined my surroundings, curious to know where we currently are. \"Oh, it's so cold in here! I wonder where we are?\" I saw that we were held inside a large holding cell with large bar doors that were locked. From the outside, there was a long white corridor, but it looked like it went around the cell. I felt a headache coming on as I tried to remember what exactly happened right after I called Hale. Then the memories came flooding back. Flashback: I waited for the call to go through as I tried to keep myself calm and Marie. The poor girl was having a sneezing fit, so I had to silence her sneezes with my other hand while I help my cell phone. Finally, someone picked up, and I knew I was put on speaker from the echo coming from the other side. \" Hey, Elise. Is everything okay?\" I heard Hale asking me, feeling slightly relieved. However, I heard the large footsteps coming out into the hallway, giving me the impression that the alien must have heard me and is now looking for us. Growing frantic, I cried quietly over the phone, panic evident in my voice. \"Hale! You guys have to come back here now!\" Marie gave out another sneeze and started to fuss about my hand being over her mouth. I hushed her, hoping the intruder didn't hear her. Hale must have noticed the fear in my reply and responded with great concern. \" What's going on, Elise? Is something wrong?\" The fear I felt grew intense as I heard the thundering footsteps coming to a halt in front of the bedroom door. Knowing I was going to get caught eventually, I gathered up my courage and tried to tell him my warning. \"No! Hale, you have to come back! Kari is-\" I froze and dropped my phone as the closet door was ripped wide open and then landed with a crunching thud on the floor. I think I heard Hale faintly on the other end of the phone, but my eyes were frozen on the figure in front of me. Marie gripped my shirt tightly, whimpering at the sight of the giant. His red eyes glowed with anger and had a sadistic glint to them. I then saw Kari hanging limply under his arm and let out a scream as he reached out to grab us. Then, my entire world went black. End Flashback \"So, I guess we must be inside that brute's place then? But the real question is where ? Wait, where's Kari?\" I glanced around, and took Marie with me as we got up to check outside the bars. To my luck, I saw another cell adjacent to ours, and inside it was Kari! \"Kari! Kari, are you alright?\" She didn't respond, as she looked like she was still out cold. Marie sneezed again, cooing without a care. I touched her forehead and it seemed that her fever went down drastically, to my great relief at the very least. But the peaceful silence soon ended as I heard a heavy door coming from the left of the curving corridor opening. Hearing loud footsteps, I held Marie close to my chest and put on my bravest face. To my nightmare, it was the same cruel alien from before. \"I see you're awake. The brat was never asleep, but she can't talk much, from what I'm aware of.\" He sneered evilly at me, pleased that I was intimidated. \"What do you want with us?\" He let out a loud, maniacal laugh and let out a deep puff from his cigar. I covered Marie's mouth to keep her from breathing in the toxic smoke. \"It's not you that I'm interested in. You're just an inconvenience, and the little brat too. What I want is simple though: revenge; and I plan to get it without any hindrances.\" I furrowed my brows. \"Not sure I follow..\" He chortled. \"My name is Swackhammer, in case she or her brother failed to mention.\" He pointed to Kari's unconscious form. \"And to make things clear, I suppose I'll let you in on my little scheme, since you both won't be around much longer. I was once a director of an amusement park called Moron Mountain, and as you may have already known, I wanted to make the Looney Tunes my slaves. However, that brat and her stupid brother won a basketball game against my used-to-be minions, and turned them against me! So, I was sent back, and found that my entire park could no longer function and was soon demolished. But that didn't stop me; oh no! Using a special kind of technology, I created this amazing fortress and even better: a particle beam cannon that can destroy your precious home planet!\" My eyes went wide with absolute horror. He was planning to kill us all! \"So.. that explains why you were dormant for six years.. you were planning all this from the very beginning!\" We looked over to see Kari struggling to get up as she finally came to her senses. Out of nowhere, Swackhammer pulled out a remote control of some sort and pressed a small yellow button on it, causing Kari to get somehow electrocuted. She screamed with the utmost pain and fell limply back down on the ground. I cried in terror, completely horrified at his inhumane action. \"Kari! Kari! NO! What did you do to her, you monster!\" He growled venomously at me, baring his fangs. \"She's out cold. She's a part of my plan, so I can't have her lollygagging about, can I?\" I held Marie as close as possible, glaring at him. \"What does she have anything to do with your plan to blow up Earth?\" He leered in closer with the most psychotic grin I have ever seen. \"That will come after I destroy all of your other friends; including my ex-henchmen. As for her.. well, heh heh... I have other things in store for her... she's grown into quite a pretty young thing, don't you agree?\" I spat at him, causing him to flinch back unexpectedly. \"You're twisted! You're vile! I hope Hale gets here soon and beats you to a pulp for even thinking such a despicable atrocity, especially about his sister!\" I screamed at him, gently rubbing Marie's back as I heard her crying softly. He grimaced, but then smirked cynically. \"I'll be expecting that, and when he does.. They're history; and Kari is just the bait I need! But seeing as how you're of some importance now, along with the little bugger.. that's makes it more the merrier!\" He turned around and started to make his leave. \"I'll come back later for her. Once they get here, I need her set up in my trap to lure her brother and all your wacky friends in; and trust me.. The last thing you will hear from your petty boyfriend is his dying breath, screaming his heart out for you and his sister.\" I whimpered as he slammed the door loudly, locking it with a loud click. I fell back onto the ground and started to cry bitterly. Marie looked up at me, her eyes searching. I chocked on my sobs, squeezing my eyes shut and holding on to Marie for comfort. \"Hale.. everyone.. please be safe.. and find us soon.\"[Chapter 15] I wonder what is to become of Kari? Well, I do own her and without her or Hale, there's no story, so do not fear! :D I must commence with this story now. So grab some popcorn.. oh, and grab your friends to join you! :D I look forward to other readers, so por favor! Third Person POV: Bugs looked down on his clipboard, gnawing on the pencil he was holding in his other hand. He glanced up at Bupkus with a questionable look. \"So, eh, you sure all this is necessary?\" Bupkus growled, angry at the fact that Marie was also kidnapped besides Kari and Elise. \"Trust me, if we're gonna find that miserable waste of mother's love, the ship will need as much tuning as possible. He isn't someone to take lightly.\" For the past seven hours, the Tunes and Monstars have been keeping their hands full by loading the ship with as many utilities as possible, ranging from tracking devices, ACME explosives courtesy of Wile E. Coyote, and reprogramming of the offense operating system that has been installed by the Monstars since the ship was made, but have never really been used. Wile was dragging a huge box full of firecrackers and fireworks, along with some Roman candles towards the cargo bay of the ship. Bupkus and Bang were in the process of framing the entire ship with armor, while Pound was adjusting the settings within the ship, programming its defense mechanisms and logging on all of it's radars. The girls asked if they could do anything to help, but were told to stay put. Lexi and was busy trying to comfort Nada, who was a bit traumatized by the negative turn of events. Mika and Maddie were complaining and retaliating as to why they couldn't come along with the others to save their friends. Daffy and Sylvester did their best to reason with them, but were more concerned with having their heads bitten off by the two angry girls. \"Whadda ya mean, we can't come? We're a part of this now, too! This is bogus!\" Maddie shouted, crossing her arms challengingly. \"Well, let's put it this way, you're girls and-\" Daffy was cut off as Mika leered in with and angry flare. \"Hold up, duck! So the reason you guys won't let us come along is cause we're women ? We fought for our rights- no, our fore-mothers fought for our woman's rights, and there's no way in hell we're gonna stay put while you guys go all macho and fight the battle! Uh-uh! Fool, we are coming, whether you like it, or not !\" Sly clutched onto Daffy in a scared hug, and Daffy reciprocating the action. \"These girls are a lot more scarier than they look.\" Sylvester whimpered. The black mallard shuddered. \"No kidding.\" Hale walked up to the two angry girls and made his own attempt. \"Look, I know you girls mean well, but we can't afford to have any more situations like with what just happened. I'm sorry, but you'll only get in the way of our rescue mission.\" Mika was about to go all out, and Maddie jumped in to hold her back. \"WHAT! So we're obstacles? Boy, I oughta-\" Lexi came in as soon as she saw the commotion and intervened. \"Hale's right.\" Hale gave a surprised glance at Lexi, while Mika and Maddie were gawking at her like she just lost her mind. \"Say what? Traitor!\" Mika scowled at Lexi. Maddie raised a brow, as if asking Lexi if she's sure. Lexi turned to face Hale. \"Don't worry. You make a point. We would only get in the way, so we'll stay put. Just please be careful.\" Hale gawked at her for another moment before knocking out of his stupor. \"Oh. Okay. Thanks, Lex. I'm glad you understand.\" Nodding, the blonde girl turned to her female companions. \"Well, let's go home, gals!\" Maddie pulled Mika along with them, the dark skinned girl still seething at the entire turnout. Nada got up and went to join them as they gathered near a tree, out of earshot and sight from everyone for the time being. \"I'll go find Blanko and wish him goodbye and good luck.\" Before she could even hesitate on making a move, Lexi pulled her and kept her in place. \"We're not heading home.\" All three girls gawked at Lexi with flabbergasted looks. Mika was about to shout a snark reply, but had Lexi's hand cover up her loud mouth. \"Keep it down. I only said what I said to Hale so he would get off our backs, as well as the Tunes and Monstars. We're going with them.\" Maddie's brows were raised with surprise and awe. \"But how are we gonna pull that off? The Tunes and Monstars are surrounding the entire area of the ship!\" Lexi shook her finger in the air, a sly grin crossing her features. \"But not the cargo bay area. The only one who's handling that area is Wile. We can sneak in there when he's not looking.\" She let go of Mika's mouth, who was giving her a bewildered look. \"But that's where the explosives are! How can we guarantee that we won't get blown into smithereens!\" Lexi shoot her a look of annoyance, causing Mika to back down a little. \"Look, it's the only chance we got if we want to help save Kari and the other two! It's either that, or we stay here. Take your pick!\" The girls glanced among one another curiously, then Nada stepped up with a confident smile. \"Count me in. Sorry, but I kinda feel responsible for all this mess. So I want to do what I can to make up for it!\" Maddie chuckled and slapped Nada on the back. \"Now that's what I'm talking about! Let's make that Swackhammer mulch!\" The three looked over at Mika. Lexi offered up to her dark friend. \"Whadda ya say, Mika?\" Mika shook her head and smirked, placing her hands on her hips. \"Y'all just a bunch of crazy people. Hell yes! I'm coming along too!\" The girls then began to silently make their way towards the area where the cargo was being loaded. Once there, they saw Yosemite helping Wile out with a large crate that seemed to be containing a missile. As they were moving the crate, the corner of it got stuck in the ground. \"Dang nab-bit! What in tar-nation?\" The little cowboy looked down and saw the corner of the box digging into the ground. Wile looked and noticed it too, grimacing. Both Tunes bent down and tried to lift up the heavy box from it's stuck position in the ground. Seeing this as an opportunity, the girls snuck by the two completely unnoticed. Once they managed to get to the far end of the cargo bay, they found a large area that wasn't occupied by boxes and crammed in there. Lexi got the girls in, making sure that their hiding spot wasn't easily visible from the loading dock and then went in to join her friends. At last, Yosemite and Wile managed to lift the box up from the dirt dune and continued their task of carrying the box into the bay. \"There. That's the last one! Now we can shut this thing and go get ourselves inside with the others.\" Wile nodded at this and the both made their way to board onto the ship. Bugs noticed them coming his way and approached them. \"Hey, docs. Ya finished loading all the ammunition?\" Yosemite gave a hefty reply, while Wile puffed out his chest proudly. \"Ya darn right, we did! Now can we get on this stupid thing? The sooner we leave, the sooner I can use my pistols!\" Bugs nodded and allowed them passage. He glanced down at his clipboard, reviewing the list that was written on the paper that was fastened to the board. \"Now let's see here: dynamites, check. ACME rocket launchers and missiles, check. Roman candles, check. Fire crackers and extra Fourth of July junk, check. Well, we got our ammunition!\" The hare flipped the page over to read the passengers list that he also prepared, just to keep track of who was going. \"Alrighty then, let's see who we got here: Me, Lola, Daffy, Taz, Sly, Tweety, Witch Hazel, Wile, Yosemite, Elmer, Pepe, Porky, Foghorn, Roadrunner, Pound, Bang, Bupkus, Blanko..\" \"Hey, Bugs!\" Looking over to see who called him, he smiled and waved over. \"Hey there, Blanko! How come ya ain't on board?\" The tall blue alien frowned slightly. \"I was looking around for Nada, but I can't find her anywhere. Have you seen her?\" Bugs shook his head apologetically. \"Sorry, doc. Can't say I have. I think Hale told her and the girls to skedaddle since they're aren't supposed to come along. Guess you must have missed her.\" Blanko hung his head in sad disappointment. \"Oh... Okay, then.\" He started making his way aboard the ship to join the others, allowing Bugs to continue his list. \"Okay, now Blanko's on board. Now all's left is Nawt and Hale. Wonder where they are?\" \"Where who are, Bugs?\" The rabbit turned to see the two he was looking for walking over towards him. \"I was talking about you two. Everyone else is on board and ready to go.\" Nawt smiled at the gray hare. \"We were discussing about what tactics we should go over for when we arrive to Moron Mountain. Knowing how Swackhammer is, it isn't gonna be an easy fight.\" Hale nodded. \"Yeah, we got to be prepared for anything. Good thing we packed up, huh?\" Bugs tilted his head in confusion. \"Eh, I know I shouldn't pry doc, but uh, do you have any idea how to get to Moron Mountain?\" Nawt nodded his head. \"The GPS system has Moron Mountain's coordinates gridded in, so it'll be a cinch. I'm just hoping that it'll be easy in and out.\" Bugs nodded back in understanding. \"So, shall we board on so we can hit the road? If we dilly dally any longer, it'll be more danger for Kari, Elise, and Marie.\" Hale pounded his fist again in the palm of his hand. \"I'm ready. Let's go!\" Nawt gave a small vengeful growl and started walking into the ship. Once they got in, Bugs motioned for the two to go take their seats while he went to join Daffy, Bupkus and Pound, who were in the front piloting the ship. Bupkus flashed on the intercom, telling everyone to take their seats as they were about to take liftoff. Bugs and Pound took control of the main controls, while Bupkus and Daffy were logging in information into the monitors, setting the coordinates of Moron Mountain's location and preparing to engage the ships battle mode. Hale sat in the front row with Nawt, Bang, Blanko and Lola. Lola patted his hand. \"Don't worry, Hale. We'll save them.\" Nodding, Hale had only two things in mind: saving his sister, cousin, and Elise and stopping Swackhammer once and for all. Feeling the ship's engine humming and vibrating, everything was now set for take off! Initiating the final phase of departure, Pound pressed a few buttons and dials, and pulled a huge lever. \"Blasting off!\" The ship lifted up and shot into the air, breaking through the thick atmosphere and into deep space.[Chapter 16] Well, Everyone's on their way to the rescue! But will their voyage alone be guaranteed without flaw? Also, what will become of Kari, Elise and Marie now that their friends are making way to Moron Mountain? This new chapter should give some light to those questions. I own only what I rightfully own, not including the Looney Tunes, Monstars, or Nada. Third Person POV: After they shot out into space, Pound checked up their routing information and was checking the piloting switches. Bugs munched on a carrot he brought with him, reading the destination log, which was set out in front of him. \"Eh, so how long will it take for us to get to Moron Mountain? It won't take us months or years, will it?\" Bupkus snickered lightly. \"Nah, that's only applicable for human technology! Our technology differs greatly. We managed to get here to Earth in a matter of half hour to an hour!\" Daffy raised his brow in interest at this dawning information. \"Really? How does that work?\" Bupkus pointed to the panel in front of him, showing the two cartoons what he meant. \"You see this here? This meter indicates how fast we're going right now. At this point, we're only going three times faster than the average space craft from Earth, but this is only set on normal drive.\" Bugs raised his brows in wonderment. \"You mean, we're only going at a normal speed right now?\" Daffy was taken aback. \"And you sat it's only three times the speed of a human space craft?\" Pound couldn't help but let out a rumbling laugh. \"You guys seem so surprised! We told you our technology is far more advanced.\" Daffy turned his attention towards Pound, raising a curious eye at him. \"But then at the speed we're going at, how long will we arrive to Moron Mountain?\" The orange alien glanced at the duck from the corner of his eye. \"Give or take, approximately two to three hours, at best.\" \"No way! We'll never make it in time at this rate!\" The four of them turned to see Hale at the doorway to the pilot's cabin. Before any could make a single protest, Hale raced up and pulled the hyper drive switch. Throughout the ship, an alarm blared off, and everyone was strapped tight to their seats with the emergency fastenings, which looked similar to the ones found on roller coaster rides to hold the entire body in place. \"Well, this can't be good!\" Nawt cried, a frantic look etched on his features. The Tunes began to panic, but the restraints were set in to where they couldn't get them off. Bang and Blanko were starting to get anxious as well, but despite their inhuman strength, they couldn't get the mechanisms off. \"Man, what did Hale just do!\" Bang shouted with dismay. Back in the control rooms, Bupkus slammed Hale into an extra seat they had available, giving him a discerning look. \"Hale, do you realize what you just activated?\" Hale glanced back with equal agitation. \"Yes, I want to make this ship go faster! Just even an hour is enough for Swackhammer to cause harm towards my sister, my cousin, and Elise!\" Daffy, oblivious to the situation hey were currently in, rolled his eyes in disbelief. \"Oh, brother. Admit it, kid; why don't you just call her your girlfriend!\" Hale flushed up a storm, giving a snarl towards Daffy. \"She's not my girlfriend!\" Pound raised his brow. \"You sure about that?\" Bugs gulped loudly, gripping on to the control levers tightly. \"Uh, guys?\" Everyone in the cabin turned their attention to the hare. \"What?\" He pointed towards the windshield. \"I think you may wanna pay attention to these guys first!\" All five of them faced the front of the ship and to their surprise and shock, there in front of them, was an entire armada of flying asteroids and small space battle ships with the Moron Mountain logo printed on them. \"Guess our ex-boss knew we were coming, huh Pound?\" Bupkus cracked his knuckles, now setting in coordinates and inputting commands into the ship's battle log. Pound growled menacingly. \"Time to show him who are the real bosses, right boys?\" He grabbed Hale and pulled in up to the front in between him and Bugs. \"Hale, grab a hold of those controls.\" Pound pointed over to what looked like two joysticks with three buttons on each one. Feeling the adrenaline rush, Hale took each stick into each hand, then glanced at Pound. \"Okay. What do I do now?\" Pound smirked at the human teen. \"You drive a car, right? Let's see how well you can drive this baby! Those buttons are to close in on a target\", he pointed to the bottom black ones, then pointed at the top blue ones above them, \"and those are to fire the lasers at them once you lock on directly.\" Hale nodded then looked at the top red ones under his thumbs. \"What about those ones?\" Bupkus raised a brow. \"That's to drop electromagnetic mine bombs, which will detonate ten seconds after you discharge them into space.\" Hale, Daffy and Bugs looked at him like he just lost his mind. \"Are you kidding?\" Bupkus shook his head. \"I was dead serious when I said we need all the equipment we could get when facing against Swackhammer. That cretin doesn't mess around, and neither do we!\" Daffy couldn't help but chuckle nervously. \"How powerful are those bombs, anyway? I'm sure they're not as bad as ACME bombs.\" Pound and Bupkus let out a loud howl of laughter. Bugs gave Daffy a 'smart question, genius' look. Pound gasped and commented. \"Let's put it this way: these tiny bombs, which are like the size of baseballs, have enough force in them to take down at least ten of your biggest military tanks back on Earth. That's how powerful they are!\" Hale gave a scared look at the two Monstars, and so did the two Tunes, who were left speechless. Pound cleared his throat and growled menacingly. \"Alright now! Time to play!\" Taking charge he ordered Bugs to twist a few dials on his left then enter the following numbers that he told him to put in. Hale took hold of the two joysticks and began to lock on to the enemy ships. Then, he pressed the blue buttons while holding on to the black ones, firing lasers at them and blasting the ships to pieces. The enemy fleet, of course, fired back with equal firepower. Pound gave a signal to Bupkus, who slammed his fist onto a huge yellow button, which triggered a large force-field around the entire ship. Bupkus then pulled a few switches and some levers, initiating an electric barrier that went over the force-field. Bupkus pointed over to Daffy. \"Duck! Time to play a round of battleships! Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates you see on the monitor above you then press the two green buttons on those controllers!\" Daffy grinned mischievously and began putting in the coordinate keys in, just like the actual battleship game, then took the controllers and fired. Another screen turned on in front of him and he noticed he blew up some meteors and enemy ships from both sides of the Monstars' ship. \"Hoo-hoo! I think I'm liking this battle tactic so far, already!\" The black mallard continued hooting with glee as he continued locking in grid keys and assaulting them with ease. Bugs continued to twist the dials and pressing buttons. After pressing all the switches, a large three dimensional map appeared right before him. According to the map, they were only less then a third of a light-year away from Moron Mountain's set location. \"Hey, docs! Looks like we're almost there!\" Bugs cried happily. Before any of them could come close to celebrating, some larger enemy ships began to fire at them, dropping down the status of the protective barrier enclosed around them. \"Dammit!\" Pound growled, shifting the main controls into over-drive. He pulled up a monitor in front of him, showing the frequency levels of the ship's boosters and defenses. The booster levels were down by a fifth, and the defenses were reduced to sixty percent. Hissing under his breath, he turned to Bupkus. \"Activate the solar deflectors, and Hale, start discharging the bombs!\" Bupkus gave a surprised look, but did as he was told. Out of nowhere, six large transparent plates appeared surrounding the ship's every area. Hale gave a shocked glance of his own. \"Pound, those things could kill!\" Pound growled at the teenage boy. \"I ain't asking, Hale! Now do it, or we're good as toast!\" Not seeing any other option, Hale pressed the red buttons, releasing two bombs at a time. Kicking up the energy streamers, Pound pulled a lever from his left, causing a sudden jolt from the ship, indicating that they're going faster than before. \"Hold on tight!\" Just a mere couple seconds after they blasted a dozen meters away, a loud booming explosion was heard from far behind, destroying more than half of what was left of the fleet. Leaving only a few small ones, a couple of middle sized ships, and one large warship left in front of them, they decided to go for one last bout. However, some emergency alarms went off, indicating that most of the ship's ammunition was used up. Daffy blew up all enemy lines from both sides of the ship and succeeded, but was now empty on further attacks. Bupkus checked all energy lines and noticed that their power levels went automatically to reserve. Bugs looked up at the map, then right in front of all of them, noticing that they were dangerously close to their destination. Hale noticed that the bombs were practically all used up and none were left to fire at the remaining enemy lines. Pound saw no other option, and pulled the emergency lever. In doing so, everyone and everything in the entire ship was secured in their current positions. \"What? Pound, what are you doing?\" cried Hale in sheer panic. Daffy and Bugs exchanged worried glances with one another. Bupkus' eyes enlarged, knowing what his leader was going to do. \"Oh, man. You serious?\" Pound grabbed the intercom mic and spoke into it for everyone to hear, including the girls who were still in hiding in the cargo bay. \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are about to go for an immediate crash landing, so hold on and hope for the best!\" Before anyone could even scream, Pound broke a glass cased box and slammed a red button. From below the ship, a large missile was being discharged, and the ship then abruptly shot forward at incredible speed. Within seconds, the missile blew up, destroying all of what's left of the enemy fleet with a powerful explosion. However, the aftermath of the explosion itself sent a shock-wave towards the ship, causing it to spiral out of control. Everyone within the ship, including those in the control room and those in the cargo bay, began to panic as the ship landed on Moron Mountain with a crashing sonic boom. Meanwhile, inside his fortress that stands in place of Moron Mountain's remains, Swackhammer let out a growling shout, smashing his giant fist down onto his desk. \"No! Those cursed brats got through my entire armada!\" He got up and began to pace around , inhaling deeply his cigar and puffing out a big cloud of smoke. After a moment, he grinned evilly. \"Well, they may have gotten past my fleet, but they won't make it through my fortress alive . I'll see to that!\" He took the keys to the dungeons and stormed off to retrieve the key instrument to his revenge: Kari. Down in the dungeons, Elise was trying to soothe Marie's constant sneezing, but to no avail. The poor toddler kept on sneezing like it was a hay-day! She startled and clung to Marie upon hearing the dungeon doors opening, the smell of cigar smoke filling the entire area. Kari was still out cold, much to Elise's dismay. Hearing the heavy footsteps approaching, Elise gathered up her courage and hoped for the best. Swackhammer approached Kari's cell first and unlocked it, picking up the unconscious girl's body from on the floor. Turning to Elise's cell, he got the key out and began to pick her lock next. \"No tricks, you hear me girl? Or I'll make you regret it.\" Nodding cooperatively, he unlocked her door and motioned her to come out. Holding on to Marie, she paused briefly, then made her way as Swackhammer was becoming impatient. \"Hurry up! I haven't got all day, and your stupid friends are now on their way to rescue you all! They may have gotten past my space fleet, but just cause they won one round, don't get your hopes up about them finding you!\" He growled as the shy girl walked out with the young toddler in her arms. As the made their way out of the dungeon and Swackhammer was about to close up the dungeon's main door, Elise took her opportunity and bit Swackhammer hard on his arm. He yelped loudly in pain and swung his arm, throwing her off of him. Landing safely on the ground, she clutched Marie tightly in her arms and began to run down the ominous corridors of the place. Swackhammer then realized she took advantage of the situation to make her escape, erupting a loud and furious roar from his being. \"That little bitch! She thinks she can get away from me, but she's wrong ! No one will get away from my wrath, or even escape !\" Hearing Swackhammer's loud and angry scream, the lighthearted girl continued running without stopping. Marie kept sneezing lightly in her arms, cooing every now and then. As soon as she reached a certain point in the area where she thought she was safe for the time being, she stopped to catch her breath. Hugging Marie close to her, she whispered, hoping someone would hear her silent prayer. \"Please, Hale! Hurry up and everyone else too! Kari, I'm sorry. Please be safe. I'll come back to get you once I find help!\" Taking no more time in staying for fear of being caught by Swackhammer, she sprinted off once more with the tiny tot in her arms, hoping to escape this madness alive.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 is now up for reads and such. I haven't posted any new chapters in a while due to recent deaths, family and family friends alike, so it was a real toll on all of us. :( This one may be short. I'll do my best! \"Darkness. All I see is nothing but darkness. Where am I anyway?\" I stirred about, only to find myself inside a dark room. Unable to see my surroundings, I decided then that I would have to feel my way around in order to find out where I was. One thing that was for certain was that I was no longer in that dungeon, and from what I can tell, Marie and Elise are nowhere to be found either. I patted on the surface below me, only to find that it was very soft and comfortable. Way too comfortable. I felt around blindly some more, now feeling the warm material of a blanket.. and near my head, some pillows. Then it dawned upon me where I was now. ' Oh, hell no! I'm in Swackhammer's room! Wait, that means... He plans to..!' \"...\" I couldn't form any words and my mind froze at the actual intention this creep had in store for me. What I couldn't finish in thought was his plan of revenge against me in the most foul way: rape. I honestly didn't want to stick around to find out if that was his intentional goal, nor do I plan to take any role in it. I listened carefully and heard only my shallow breathing in the dark room. \"Guess he ain't here. This is my chance!\" I didn't feel any restraints on any of my ligaments, so I got up freely and carefully to try and find a way out. I was able to make out distinct shapes and shadows of certain objects, which really wasn't that difficult. Making my way over to a nearby desk, I carefully pulled the drawers open to see what I could find in there. As soon as I pulled out the second drawer, I was lucky enough to find a flashlight in there, along with some spare batteries. I took the flashlight and switched it on, then pocketed the batteries. I glanced around the room further and investigated it thoroughly, hoping to find any other useful objects, hopefully weapons, that can come in handy. Without any luck, I sighed with bitter disappointment and started illuminating the light around, hoping to find something that would serve as an exit before Swackhammer returns, only to do who knows what to me. The light gently illuminated parts of the wall, showing no signs of any doors or windows. Just as I was about to give up hope, I caught sight of an odd bump underneath the rug. Removing the rug and rolling it aside, it revealed to be hiding a trap door. I hesitated, but then snapped into attention as I heard Swackhammer's familiar roars and yells from down the hall. Taking no chance of getting caught, I lifted the door up and jumped into the floor below, closing the trap door securely above me. There was a sliding lock on it, so I locked it up, giving no opportunity for Swackhammer to chase me down. Gathering my bearings, I turned the light towards the direction of a long corridor, and the only corridor available for me to travel down anyways. There was no turning back now; I gathered up my courage and decided to make my way through this place. After what seemed like hours of walking through the passage, making turns here and there and rising up a couple stairways along the way, I felt like I was getting nowhere. I stopped my ongoing trek and closed my eyes momentarily, placing my hand above where my heart was. \"Hale.. Nawt... where are you? If you guys can hear me, please... show me the way where I can find something of use! Something that I can use to get out of here and that will help defeat Swackhammer.\" I opened my eyes and just like the many times I've had my pleas answered, a bright pink illuminating light glowed from up ahead. I gasped slightly, but took this as a response to my cry for help and followed it. I ran as fast as I could, despite I was worn out and near exhaustion. The light whizzed and made a path for me to follow. Being the sharp person I was, I wasted no time in following the little bright pink ball. After a couple moments of goose chasing, the light came to a stop and hovered high above in the air, right above my head. Feeling the sudden urge, along with the intuitive instinct that's resonating from my heart, I reached up to touch the little ball. The light then started to grow brighter and brighter, practically blinding me with it's radiance. I cracked my eyes open and right before me, a sword was there in my hands. It was a pinkish silver blade with roses engraved near the blunt side of the blade. The hilt had a satin red fabric wrapped tightly around it, with a chain extending from the end of the hilt, with a crystal rose charm dangling at the end of it. The blade was probably half my full size, but for some reason, it didn't feel that heavy. 'Whoa.. A sword with roses.. talk about some funky deja vu.. Now let's see if I can get out... of.. here?' I Looked up and about to see that I have also been transported to another location within the fortress. It looked like a gorge of some sort. All I know was that I was outside of the fortress, but still within it's boundaries. The flashlight that was in my hand was also gone, along with the spare batteries. \"So I'm just left with a sword. Well, can't beat anyone up with a stick of light, huh?\" Hearing and feeling a loud rumbling noise, I turned around to see that I was all of a sudden surrounded by hundreds of robots, dressed in armor and had weapons in their metallic claws. To be honest, I was scared out of my wits. Without a doubt, I was completely surrounded on all sides. Taking a look down at the beautiful sword in my right hand's hold, I closed my eyes shut. My heart felt a lot different, like it was lighter and my soul felt like it gained a new height in willpower. I opened my eyes and faced my thousand opponents with bravado. \"Well, guess I have no other option if I want to see my friends again. Hale, Nawt.. you guys are with me, right?\" I clutched my left hand to my heart, and nodded. \"You guys are all with me. Now.. time to do this!\" I gripped the hilt with both hands and made a daring start towards the hue sea of heavily armed robots. I leaped up and took the first swing. The first robot that was in front of me went down with ease. I was amazed at the force and strength this sword actually had. The robots, however, kept coming at me with violent blows of their own. I smirked, knowing this was going to take a while. \"One down, hundreds more to go!\"[Chapter 18] Well, I've been gone for too long and I guess I deserve a bit of a butt whooping because of that. Just want to let you know that school did keep me very busy and all I can do is apologize. To make up for it, I decided to work on Chapter 18 while I'm here at school (I doubt I have any upcoming classes until around 1). Enjoy and I own only my OCs except for Nada, who belongs to MonstarzGirl. Hale's POV: Waking up was a bit of a doozy. While clutching onto my forehead and moaning, I sought the strength to get up and look around for any damage that may have been done to the ship. I noticed smoke coming from the front end of the ship and hobbled over there. The rudder of the engine was fried. Great. My vision cleared as I looked around for the others. Thankfully, everyone was still together and it seemed no one got hurt except for the ship. Nawt was the second one to come to as he shook his head to clear himself from his crash-landing stupor. Blinking his eyes a couple times, he glanced around his surroundings then spotted me. He smirked. \"So I guess we all lived, huh?\" He got up and dusted the dirt off himself. I went over to him with a bewildered look, noticing the environment and how vast it is. \"So this is Moron Mountain?\" He nodded his head. \"Yep, The one and only. Pretty pathetic, isn't it? This used to be our home before we were sent over to your planet.\" I was shocked. This barren wasteland with hardly any sources of life, let alone fertile life, was originally their home? I shook my head at the poor condition of the planet. ' Now that we were here, we can finally resume our mission to find and save Kari, Elise, and Marie .' \"Hey! Hale! Nawt!\" We both turned our heads to see Bugs and the other Tunes and Monstars now awake and trying to pry the tailgate of the ship open. Nodding at one another, we began to rush over to help our comrades in opening the large door. I glanced carefully at the gate. \"What's wrong with it?\" Bupkus took a deep breath then tried to pry it open again with the help of the others. \"It's stuck! Something from inside must have jammed one of the hinges!\" Nawt and I went on either end of the door and began helping to get it open. It wouldn't budge. ' Rats!' I thought to myself, 'Our extra weapons and ammunition is still in there! We need them to get inside Swackhammer's fortress!' Unfortunately, the only entry to the tailgate was the main tailgate door itself. There was no other bypass door. ' If only there was a way to get rid of whatever is keeping the door from opening. Wish there was someone who could go in there and help get this open..' Third Person POV: Meanwhile, inside of the trunk of the ship behind all of the ACME material, the girls who were hiding in the very back, were strewn about on top of one another from the crash. A certain blonde shook her head lightly before settling to the realization that the ship was finally set on firm ground. \"Hey gals! I think we made it!\" Lexi squealed in surprise. Mika moaned while her head kept tilting from side to side. Maddie groaned and rubbed her lower back sorely. \"'Bout damn time, too! I thought we were going to die! What the hell was Hale thinking?!\" Nada, who was making her way out of their little hiding spot, could hear the grunts and cries of the Tunes and Monstars from outside the tailgate door. \"I think they're having trouble opening the door.\" Lexi got on her two feet and climbed her way over to where Nada was over the dozens of boxes and carts full of ACME explosives and weapons. \"So? Why can't they get it open? We're not gonna be stuck here, are we?\" Panic started to rise in her voice. Mika and Maddie were now in tow, trying to glare into the somewhat dark space that they're in. Mika gently moved both Nada and Lexi aside, catching a glimpse of something near the edge of the left side of the door. \"Looks like a candle. Anyone got a light on 'em?\" Nada and Lexi searched their pockets, but to no avail. They both shrugged in defeat. Maddie sat angrily down on the floor, scowling bitterly. \"Great! Just fantastic! Now we're stuck here in the back on this ship with nothing but a dozen explosives and ammunition to keep us company!\" Lexi glanced down at her disapprovingly. \"We can't just give up, Maddie! We have to keep trying. There's got to be a way out.\" Nada nodded in agreement. \"She's right! We have to! It's the only way we can save Kari and the other two from Swackhammer.\" Maddie glared through the darkness at her two friends. \"How can you be sure they're not dead already? For all we know, while we were playing Star Wars with the enemy ships, he didn't just go and brutally murder them!\" Nada tried to hold back a stifling sob. She hated this; Swackhammer, her friend being kidnapped along with an innocent toddler and another innocent bystander. She wished there was something that could be done immediately. Lexi noticed Nada's anxiety despite the darkness separating them and glared back at Maddie. \"They're not dead. I'm sure of it. Now quit being such a bitch and help us find a way out! The sooner, the better. Whining and complaining about our current situation won't take us anywhere.\" Mika ignored their little argument and tried to look closer at the door and noticed something is stuck in between the hinges. \"Maddie. C'mere, would ya?\" Maddie held back a reluctant reply and instead complied to her friend's wish as she carefully crawled over to where she was. \"What's up?\", she said bitterly. Mika pointed at the hinges. \"There seems to be something stuck there in between those two hinges. That's why the guys can't pry the door open. I could get it out, but I need some light. Don't you have a lighter on you?\" Maddie widened her eyes a bit and started rummaging through her pockets. \"Hold on, I think I have it on me… Let's hope I didn't leave it at home..\" It was Lexi's turn to scowl as she made a retort \"The hell! You mean to tell me that you were sitting your arse down, bitching while all this time, YOU had a lighter on your person? Son of a-\" Nada tried calming her down. \"Now, now. Let's not get into another fight. Remember, we got to work together to get out of here. The guys can't do this alone.\" Maddie grumbled, \"The hell, they can't. They're sitting ducks without us! Ah-ha! Here it is!\" She pulled out a lighter with a yin-yang symbol engraved on it. Mika glanced around for hopes of finding a candle. She smiled as she found something that looked like a candle at the corner of her eye. \"Got a stick. Now light her up!\" Maddie opened the top and started to flick the wheel to light it. Nothing. \"Oh, come on! Why won't it light?\" Mika looked over and now noticed that they were covered in something powdery. \"Huh.. that's strange.. where'd this stuff come from?\" Nada quipped in curiosity. \"What stuff?\" Lexi noticed it too, despite not being able to see at all. She felt something soft but grainy on her skin. \"Nada, check your skin.\" \"Huh? My skin?\" Lexi nodded, her outline of her head barely made out to Nada. The obsidian haired girl ran her hand gingerly down her arm and felt that substance. \"You're right! There's something on us. Maddie, wait! Don't try to-\" Maddie growled on frustration. \"This piece of shit ain't workin'!\" She threw down her lighter in an angry notion. \"Why can't we just light this shit up?!\" She pointed her finger at the candle Mika was holding and to hers and the other girl's surprise.. fire shot out from the tip of her finger. \"Aaaiiiee!\" Maddie fell back in shock, not believing what she had just done. Mika gaped at her than at the candle. It was a bright light on the wax rope of the candle. Lexi and Nada couldn't believe their eyes as Lexi let out a breathless \" Whoa .\" Maddie shakily brought up her hand to her face and, as though she willed it, her five fingers lit up with flames at the tips. She dropped her hand and the flames disappeared. Mika snapped out of her own stupor and glanced at Maddie once more with a smile. \"Well, you definitely lit that shit up!\" Looking back down at the item that was stuck in between the hinges, she grabbed a stick of dynamite that was in there and pulled it out. As she pulled it out, a loud rumble came onto the ship, causing Lexi and Nada to tumble over to where Maddie and Mika were. Losing balance, Mika was knocked back and by mistake, had the candle flying out of her hand and into a full carton of ACME fireworks and rockets. The door of the tailgate was finally pried open, allowing the girls to be sent flying out of the back and into the arms of their Monstar counterparts. \"What the hell?\" Bupkus cried out as his eyes boggled at the sight of Lexi in his arms. Bang dove down to the ground and caught Maddie with a cry. Pound grabbed hold of Mika with a surprised look. Blanko, who saw Nada tumbling last, caught her nimbly by the arm and held her bridal style. Hale, Nawt, and the rest of the Tunes looked at the girls with their eyes almost falling out of their sockets. \"What the hell are you girls doing here!?\" Hale cried out in exasperation. Bugs gawked at the scenario that was in front of their eyes, but switched to a horrified expression when he glanced up. \"Uh.. docs?!\" Everyone simultaneously looked up with their eyes widening. Hale screamed, \"EVERYONE GET DOWN!\" All at once, everyone took cover as the ACME fireworks and explosive rockets shot out of the back of the ship like it was the Fourth of July, flying and whizzing in different directions. A big rocket went flying straight into the fortress wall, blowing a huge hole into it. All the other rockets flew about, hitting parts of the large domain and even destroying some of the lethal areas and some booby-traps. Once the noise settled down and it was safe to get up, the gang turned their heads over to the large entrance made by the biggest rocket. The girls turned to Maddie, causing the others to notice this notion and look at her as well. She flushed in embarrassment and chuckled lightly. \"Well.. at least we can go in now, huh?\"[Chapter 19] Hello again! Been gone for about a little over 4 months. I didn't mean to torture anyone out there. o.o Anyways, here's is Chapter 19. After this story, I will go on about and start on my idea for a Batman fanfic. Yes, I am seriously into that Batman flow. I don't own what belongs to Warner Bros., and Nada Sampson belongs rightfully to MonstarzGirl. Other than that, I do own my own OCs, my iPod, and my own personal legal copies of Space Jam, as well as Batman Arkham City and Arkham Asylum. Elise's POV: I kept running down the many corridors that abide within this giant place. Marie was still snug and safe in my arms as I searched frantically for any sign of an exit, or at least, a good place to hide from Swackhammer. God, I really hope that the gang will find us. That Hale finds us. I was also praying for the safety of Kari, and that Swackhammer hasn't done anything to her whatsoever. Than again, one can only hope and pray in this hellhole. Marie cooed and gave a light sneeze. I stopped for a brief moment to make sure her blanket was wrapped securely around her tiny body. The last thing I needed was for her to get even more sick. She sighed, displaying exhaustion overcoming her tiny being. I couldn't blame her; this place is so huge and sinister, it's like it can drain the very life out of anyone. Anyone except the monster that dwells inside it as its home. A loud crashing noise rang through the enormous hall, causing me to jump in a scare. Marie was just as alarmed and clutched tightly to my shirt whimpering. I gently petted her head and tried to squint my eyes in the vast darkness, looking for the source of the noise. \"Elise! Kari! Where are you guys?!\" The voice that called out was all too familiar. I sighed in desperate happiness and called out in reply, \"Hale! We're over here!\" I kept a firm hold on Marie and ran in the direction I heard the voice. Making a turn onto the next corner, I saw Hale, along with what looked like Pound, Mika, Bugs, Lola, Pepe, Bupkus, Lexi, Elmer, Witch Hazel, Roadrunner and Wile. Hale caught sight of Marie and I and cried out in relief, \"Elise! Marie! You're okay!\" The group ran towards us with alighted joy of our safety. Hale pulled me into a tight embrace, but not tight enough so that it will crush the toddler in my arms. As we pulled away, Bupkus rushed over and took the tiny tot from my arms with gusto, tears rolling down his face as he hugged and kissed the light bundle. \"Marie! Thank God you're safe! You're not hurt anywhere, are you?\" He checked the small girl for any signs of bruises or other injuries. To his relief, there wasn't any. Lexi couldn't help but make an awed face at the cute scene, as well as the rest of the Tunes. Hale suddenly looked alarmed and turned to me. \"Elise, where's my sister?\" I opened my mouth to speak, but I closed it again and shook my head. Hale and the rest of the group became tense. He grabbed my arms firmly, his voice laced with desperation, \"Please, Elise! Tell me where she is!\" I broke down with a sob, unable to keep my calm facade. \"Swackhammer had her locked up in a cell! But I escaped when he went to go retrieve her. He said something about using her to exact his revenge on both of you! Hale... I- I think... He wants... no... He plans to...\" If Hale couldn't have been more scared in his life, then right now he was surely about to collapse from the unavoidable horror that's about to be said to him. Even the Tunes and the two Monstars with their human female counterparts shook at part of the revelation of Swackhammer's sick scheme as it fell from my quaking lips in an agonizing scream. \"He... HE PLANS TO RAPE HER, HALE! PLEASE! YOU GUYS HAVE TO SAVE HER!\" I couldn't keep myself together. I fell apart, shaking from head to toe. Witch Hazel came over to my side to try and console me, casting a worried glance at Hale. Hale, on the other hand, was beyond the point of calm. Balling his hands into fists to the point that his nails were digging cuts into his palms, his entire being shook, but just from possible fear for his sister. He gritted his teeth and hissed, \"I'm going to find that bastard and rip him a new one! If he so touches even a hair on my sister... no.. I'm gonna kill him! We're gonna go find Swackhammer and make him hear that fat lady sing, for it's gonna be the last thing he'll ever hear!\" Pound growled with just as much hatred, \"Then what are we waiting for?! Let's go get that son of a bitch!\" Mika and Lexi nodded their heads and took their stance. \"Let's go beat the hell outta this mofo! It's 'bout time he meets his maker!\" The Tunes put on the meanest faces they could muster, while Witch Hazel sprinkled some sort of strange powder on me. I glanced over at her in curiosity, wiping away my tears from my puffy face. \"W- What's this?\" She cackled gleefully, \"This powder awakes your inner abilities! The girls stowed away into our ship and apparently got some on them as well, so they have their powers. Can't leave our healer behind now, can't we?\" My eyes widen as my hands glowed a light lime color with bright yellow sparkles, almost like fairy dust. Before I knew it, the bruise I had where Swackhammer hit me earlier was gone, like it was never there! Hale took a hold of my hand and looked at me seriously. \"Elise, take us to where you saw Swackhammer last.\" Before I could even protest, something went off beeping. Pound looked down at a walkie talkie that was strapped onto his waistband and answered. \"Talk to me.\" A voice on the other side that sounded like Nawt replied. \"Pound! We got a problem!\" Pound pressed the button for reply \"What's wrong? Is it Swackhammer?\" We all exchanged worried glances among one another. \"Yeah, and you won't believe this: he's got a particle beam cannon with everything set to destroy Earth! This guy's a loose cannon himself!\" It seemed like all of us couldn't shake the feeling that there's more than just what Nawt said. Pound silenced that thought by voicing it to his comrade, \"Is he there? I got a feeling there's something else you're not telling me.\" Nawt's response came only a few moments later. \"He's not here. Blanko and Bang are halfway to shutting down the cannon and disabling it for good... and well... there's another thing...\" Pound grounded his teeth and asked, \"What? Nawt, what is going on?\" Another few moments later did Nawt reply. \"Swackhammer... he... he's got Nada. He's threatening to kill her, unless...\" Pound growled, not liking where this is going. I held my breath, while Hale brushed his thumb over my hand soothingly, trying to keep his calm. \"Unless what?\" \"... Unless we give him both Hale and Kari. Pound, you got any ideas? I don't want-\" Before Nawt could finish, Pound asked in concern. \"Wait, wait! Back up! Kari? You didn't find her?\" Hale and I exchanged surprised glances. Nawt replied back just as shocked, \"You mean she isn't with you guys? I thought you guys went to look for her, Elise and Marie?!\" Pound shook his head before answering, \"We did. We only found Elise and Marie, but no sign of Kari. Elise said that Swackhammer planned to use her to exact revenge on her and her brother. Nawt... He planned to rape her...\" A long silence passed for what seemed like a long while before Nawt responded with anger and hate evident in his voice, \"That filthy motherf-.. When I get my hands on him, I'm gonna-\" Pound quickly cut him off, \"Not now, Nawt! Listen, did you, Blanko, or any of the Tunes that are with you see her?\" Nawt gave a shaky sigh over the talkie, \"No. Nothing so far, though... I have a feeling Swackhammer lost her too. So there's still time to find her... and Nada, too.\" Pound nodded before continuing, \"Good. Let's hope so. Where are you guys at now?\" \"In the observation tower, where our ex-boss has all his tv monitors and surveillance. Guess he was keeping tabs on us.. Wait, what?!\" Nawt shrieked on the other end, making us all jump. We heard Blanko and the other Tunes, along with Bang and Maddie cry out in surprise. Pound gripped on the radio even tighter. \"What the hell is going on over there now?!\", he hollered. Hale stiffened for a moment, squeezing my hand a little too tight for comfort. What we were all about to hear next chilled us all. Nawt shouted over the speaker, making Pound almost drop the small radio out of his hand, \"Nada just got away and is heading back to base... and... Kari is fighting Swackhammer on the high bridge!\" Bupkus cried out, \"The high bridge?! Are you kidding?! She'll DIE! They both will! It's too narrow and it's too unstable!\" The Tunes gasped and muttered in worry. Mika and Lexi gave each other alarmed looks. I turned to Hale to calm him, but before I knew it, he was long gone. Pound noticed and so did Bugs. The large orange Monstar growled, \"Great. Now we got a heated up pyro on the loose! C'mon everyone! We're heading to the observation tower!\" I looked over at Pound in dismay. \"But what about Hale?!\" He glanced over at me with a grim look, \"He's already on his way there. That's right next to where the high bridge is at.\"[Chapter 20] Getting closer to the end here, ladies and gents! I know that last chapter seemed to have left a lot out, so I'll be covering what happened in this one. I give you all Chapter 20! I own only my OCs. Nada Sampson belongs to MonstarzGirl. The only profit I make from this are comments, followers, and favorites. Nothing more. Kari's POV: ' Damn.. These things just keep on coming and coming! Is there no end to them?! ', I thought to myself as I sliced through another robot. I must have went through at least three or four hundred of them. Still, no matter how many I cut through, the number that remains doesn't seem to dwindle in the slightest. I could feel myself beginning to tire as the robots start closing in on me. Gathering my nerves and steadying myself, I gripped my sword tighter and took another quick swing. Wham! Another one bites the dust. \"Just what will it take for you guys to quit ?!\", I shrieked, preparing another fatal blow to an oncoming robot. \"If this keeps up, I'll never beat these guys! There's got to be a way to take them all down faster!\" Out of nowhere, my sword started to glow a bright pink, and suddenly, I felt a surge of energy flowing through me like never before! It was as if I've been given the extra strength I needed to go on. With a hunch, I burst out running and jumped up into the air. Almost as if I had wings, I swooped down and up again, taking down ten robots at a time in one strike. I landed down, with the slaughtered pieces of metal bursting into a small explosion altogether. I gaped at what I just did and took a glimpse down at my rose colored weapon. 'Whoa.. Did I just do THAT? Hmm.. This gives me an idea, aside from the upper hand.' I got back up with a smirk. The robots started to charge towards me, but not as quick as I was. Charging toward them again, I repeated the same action to another handful and got another group down just as quickly. I then quickly grabbed one of the more busted looking ones and threw them into a larger group, the explosion from that one robot causing a larger number to blow up as well. Within several minutes of repeating the process, I was down to only twenty to thirty robots remaining. Though it successfully depleted their original armada, the effort wore me down pretty rapidly. Taking in lungfuls of air, I kept myself at guard, knowing the fight isn't over by a long shot. I gave one last bout and bounded into the air, diving in for one last go. In a matter of seconds, the robots were completely wiped out into nothing. Inhaling a deep whiff of air, I gave a sigh of relief, thankful that this fight is over. However, the war itself is still raging on. \"How long have I been at this? Damn. At this rate, Swackhammer might already be getting that cannon charged up to fry Earth!\" Biting my lip bitterly, I glanced up at the castle behind me. Even though I am within the perimeter walls, I would still have a ways to go in order to make my way up to where the particle beam is nested at. To make things even more challenging, I didn't have a tour map for the area either. ' This is gonna be a lot tougher than I thought it would be. Guess I'll just have to wander around and see where's an entrance' Lo and behold did I no sooner hear a loud booming sound not far from where my location was. \"What was that?\", I muttered to myself. Curiosity getting the best of me, as always, I began making my way over to the source of the loud noise that broke through the starry space surrounding me. Running as fast as I could for a couple minutes, I eventually ran into a large hole that was made in one of the tower walls. Inside, I could make view of a stairwell leading all the way up to the top. Catching my breath, I smiled to myself in assurance, \"Well well, looks like I found my entry. Watch out, Swackhammer! This time, there's no time out for you!\" Nawt's POV: 'This is ridiculous! I can't believe Hale suggested we split up! Then again, he may have his reasons. It'll probably give us more chances of running into either Swackhammer or the girls. Either way, one of our groups is going to have a ball in beating the living crap out of him.' , I thought with bitterness as my group made our way up through the tower that Bang and Maddie oh so kindly blew a hole into after we split into two separate groups. Hale decided to take Pound, Mika, Bupkus, Lexi and some of the Tunes with him towards the west sector of Moron Mountain to look for the hostages, while I led the other half of the group to the east sector to find Swackhammer. Getting in was made more easy than we thought. But it also made me wonder where the rest of Swackhammer's reinforcements went. I figured he would have his robot guards charging to our location the soonest that we crash landed, but to our surprise, not even a space worm came crawling to any of us. \"Hey Bang! Didn't Swackhammer have an army in his disposal aside from that armada we defeated?\", I called to the green giant behind me. The green monolith growled in scrutiny, \"I thought so, but I guess he didn't have the time to set them out to sic on us! This must be our lucky break!\" I furrowed my brows. Something was wrong here. Very wrong. 'I doubt it's that we're lucky. Something must have gone out of our ex-boss's plans and must have shifted the rest of his army to a different location. He had all the time in the world to send them out on all of us, so what's keeping them..?' Blanko must have noticed the same thing I have, voicing out his concerns, \"No way, Bang. He would have crushed us if he had the chance. Something's not right.\" Daffy sputtered in questioning concern, \"So you're saying that thisth sad excusth of a loser had a change of plansth and moved the rest of histh army to another area? Is that it?\" Nada raised her brows in surprise. \"I wonder what made him change his mind about attacking us head on like he originally intended?\" \"Good question, Nada. Looks like we'll find out when we get there, huh?\", replied Maddie with a growl. I had to agree with her there. We won't get any answers until we reach the top of the observation tower. Above us by a few meters was a platform. In it was a small chamber that had two separate doors; one that leads to the observation room where all of Swackhammer's devices and gizmos lay about, while the other leads to the high bridge, which is completely off-limits to anyone who values their life. It was far too unstable and narrow to support weight that's above Pound's capacity, hell, even my weight along with Blanko's could be enough to cause the bridge to collapse in no time at all! As we were getting on the platform that was one level below the observation room, the lights suddenly began to flicker until they went completely out. Cries and gasps of panic echoed through the tiny chamber, when Bang's voice boomed, \"Alright people, keep your shorts on! Maddie, care to lend me a hand?\" Within a few moments, Maddie and Bang managed to light up the unused torches that resided within the chamber. I looked around to see that everyone has calmed down. \"Is everyone okay?\" I got murmurs and content replies, until Blanko piped up with fright, \"Wait! Nada's gone!\" The Tunes looked around with worried glances. Bang and Maddie looked around, as well as myself. \"Dang! Where'd she go?\", Maddie wondered aloud. Bang growled lowly. \"Looks like Swackhammer decided to take a hostage.\" Maddie fumed, \"What a coward! He should face us and fight like a real man!\" She balled up her fists and punched the air a few times for emphasis. Blanko shuffled uncomfortably. I couldn't blame him; I'm still anxious about Kari's well being and safety too. Let's just hope we're not too late. I shuffled over to Blanko and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Don't worry. We'll find her too. Let's go and take care of business first though.\" He smiled faintly and nodded his head, and we continued our way through the giant door. Upon entering the room, I let out a gasp at the sight that lay before us. Aside from his many television screens displaying security cameras visuals on all locations throughout his fortress, next to the enormous glass windows was a huge cannon; big enough to wipe out an entire planet! Blanko and Bang widen their eyes with their mouths gaping at the grand size weapon. \"Shit! He had THIS thing the entire time?!\", Bang sputtered out in disbelief. Blanko shook his head, \"No way, man. This took a long time to build single-handed. It must have took months for him to make this, let alone plan it all out.\" I couldn't believe it. All of it. Swackhammer was toying with us the entire time! He could have blown us sky high without our knowledge at any given time he desired; the harassing and kidnapping was all for his entertainment. I shook my head and got out of my stupor and looked over at Bang and Blanko, \"You two try and shut this thing down and dismantle it! If we let this opportunity escape, it could mean the end for all of us!\" Both tall aliens nodded their heads and got to work. Blanko began accessing the computer mainframe, while Bang carefully, yet firmly, started putting apart the enormous contraption piece by piece, making sure not to make any sudden mistakes that could be potentially fatal. The Tunes and Maddie walked around and stared in awe at the sight of all the equipment that was surrounding us in the room, unable to believe what they saw either. No sooner did we hear on the large intercom Swackhammer's disgusting voice chuckling in sinister glee, \"Good luck trying to disable that cannon there, wimps! You may have found my cannon and ruined my plans to destroy Earth, but I have one more trick up my sleeve. You see, I have a lovely friend of yours here that's dying to be put out of her misery. Serves her right for betraying our little agreement though. Now, if you want her to live , you'll have to do me one simple favor: give me both Kari and Hale. But you might want to hurry. Clock's ticking! Tick, tock! Tick! TOCK! \" His chortling laughter was all that we heard until the line went out, ending his small talk. I gave an angry growl at our ex-boss's bold statement, while Blanko glared daggers at the intercom's speakers, muttering curses under his breath. Bang chided at our blue comrade, \"Hey! Keep it together, Blanko! We got a job to do first! We'll find your girlfriend, after we take apart this son of a bitch's toy!\" Blanko reluctantly nodded and got back to the computer monitor in front of him. I grabbed the walkie talkie that was strapped onto my waistband that Pound handed over to me before we split into groups and tried to broadcast him in, hoping to give him the scary news. At last, I heard a beep and got his deep voice, \"Talk to me.\" I replied with haste, \"Pound! We got a problem!\" A beep, followed by a click and his reply, \"What's wrong? Is it Swackhammer?\" I nodded despite he couldn't see me, \"Yeah, and you won't believe this: he's got a particle beam cannon with everything set to destroy Earth! This guy's a loose cannon himself!\" I felt overwhelmed. This was all so messed up. Swackhammer needed to be stopped! Pound's voice came back on through the small speaker, \"Is he there? I got a feeling there's something else you're not telling me.\" I gulped inaudibly. He was right about that. On the same speaking, even I felt like there's more to this sinister plan than what we already in front of our naked eyes. Something foreboding. \"He's not here. Blanko and Bang are halfway to shutting down the cannon and disabling it for good... and well... there's another thing...\" Pound sounded tense as his voice reeled me back into our current conversation, \"What? Nawt, what is going on?\" I took in a deep breath and replied, \"Swackhammer... he... he's got Nada. He's threatening to kill her, unless...\" \"Unless what?\", the orange alien asked, his voice giving away his uneasiness. I tried to compose myself and replied, though my voice came out shakily, \"... Unless we give him both Hale and Kari. Pound, you got any ideas? I don't want-\" I couldn't finish my sentence as Pound jump in with hasty concern, \"Wait, wait! Back up! Kari? You didn't find her?\" My heart skipped a few beats as I gaped at the radio in utter shock. 'What the hell?! She's NOT with them?!' \"You mean she isn't with you guys? I thought you guys went to look for her, Elise, and Marie?!\" Pound answered back, \"\"We did. We only found Elise and Marie, but no sign of Kari. Elise said that Swackhammer planned to use her to exact revenge on her and her brother.\" I was dumbfounded. 'Use her for revenge? Well, revenge was an obvious, but what does he mean \"use her\"?' To mine and everyone else's horror, Pound gave the answer. An answer that instantly chilled me, and yet set me afire with a great fury. \"Nawt... He planned to rape her...\". Gasps came from the Tunes, Maddie looked like she saw a baby get hit by a car, and Blanko and Bang stopped what they were doing with wide eyes filled with horror and disgust. I shook violently at the thought of it. The very nerve of that waste of life! Daring to touch.. no... to violate what I held so dear to my heart! I gripped the walkie tightly in my hand, my teeth clamped together as I seethed with venom filled words, \"That filthy motherf-.. When I get my hands on him, I'm gonna-\" I was quickly cut off by Pound, \"Not now, Nawt! Listen, did you, Blanko, or any of the Tunes that are with you see her?\" I took at least several breaths and gave a shaky sigh, \"No. Nothing so far though... I have a feeling Swackhammer lost her too. So there's still time to find her... and Nada, too.\" At least, I hope there's still time. The news of Swackhammer's real intentions towards my beloved changes things. As a matter of speaking, time is certainly not waiting for us to catch up. Pound brought me back to reality in confirmation, \"Good. Let's hope so. Where are you guys at now?\" I straightened myself up. \"In the observation tower, where our ex-boss has all his tv monitors and surveillance. Guess he was keeping tabs on us.. Wait, what?! \", I shrieked out as something on one of the monitors caught my eye. Maddie and the Tunes snapped their heads in my directions and joined me near the many television screens. Maddie cried out, \"Oh my God!\" Bang and Blanko finally finished disabling the cannon completely and rushed over the soonest they heard the brunette's cry. Bang ogled at what he saw what we were looking at, \"What the hell?! Is she NUTS?!\" Blanko let out a gasp, \"Oh no!\" The Tunes were just in equal amount of shock as the rest of us, with Sylvester voicing out what deems to be the voice of everyone's current thought, \"Thufferin' Thuccotash! I stood in front of the monitor frozen in fear. My mind was racing at over a hundred miles per hour, as well as my heart beat. All comprehensive and logical thoughts flew out the window at that moment as I stared wide eyed at the sight before me with sheer terror. Pound's voice shattered my train wreck of a mind with a holler, \"What the hell is going on there now?!\" I raised the small device to my mouth and replied as coherently as possible, \"Nada just got away and is heading back to base... and... Kari is fighting Swackhammer on the high bridge!\" I couldn't keep my composure any longer. I dropped the radio to the ground with a loud echoing clank and bolted towards the door.[Chapter 21] DUN, DUN, DUUUUUN! Looks like the final showdown is at hand. Are you all ready for this?

Third Person POV: Swackhammer chuckled with such evil satisfaction as he gripped Nada tightly in his left arm. He couldn't believe his luck at swiping away the young brunette under their noses. He knew that they were all on their way, so he triggered off the power and took his chance to sneak in and grab the girl then slip away before they could even react. He made sure to lock the door that led straight to the high bridge, just in case they thought about going after him. He chortled darkly at his hostage, \"Looks like your friends better make quick work about finding and bringing both of those damn brats if they want to have you back safely.\" Nada glared at him with great dislike. \"Just wait! You'll be sorry!\" Swackhammer let out a sick, rumbling laugh. \"Sorry?! Don't be so naïve! It's your friends that should be sorry! It's all their fault that I lost everything! My cohorts, my amusement park, my would-be-entertainment... My life !\" His grip on her tightened, threatening to choke the breath out of her fragile body. She coughed and strained, but to no avail. Grinning snidely, he bent down and hissed in her ear, \"Frankly, I couldn't give two cents about any of you pathetic weaklings. I could have blasted you all into smithereens any time I wanted!\" She let out a terrified gasp, but was cut off from being able to say anything as he squeezed her. \"I only messed around with you bunch just to get a kick out of it. It was tiresome, I'll admit, jumping back and forth here and there, but hey, I got what I wanted ...\", he spoke the last words maliciously and with a hint of dark lust behind them. Nada trembled in fear. Her eyes began to water, not liking where this was going. She managed to choke out a few words, \"W-what... do you mean...? Y-you're not... you're not going to..\" Swackhammer snorted in amusement and shook his head slightly. \"Oh no, girlie. You got that idea all wrong. It's like I said, you're not the one I'm after. And that brat Hale is just another obstacle, though I am really hoping to tear him apart, piece by piece...\" The raven-haired teen struggled against his iron grip and cried out, \"Then what? What do you mean?!\" He cracked a nasty grin and leered down, whispering darkly so only she could hear, \"Kari, of course. She's grown into quite a delicious young piece of ass, if you know what I mean.\" Nada felt sick. She trembled in horror as he continued, \"Once I have all of your friends rid of, as well as my other hostages, Hale, and you too of course... I plan to enjoy every single second of screwing that little bitch and make her scream, knowing that all of you will be dead, and she'll have no choice but to give me all the pleasure that I demand without so much as a fight. Sure, I did originally plan to kill her with her brother and leave it as it is, but after that lovely performance with her singing.. Well, heh, let's just say that minds, just like plans, can change. Just imagine, her sweet voice crying out over and over again, as I tear her down till she's no more but a doll that will obey my every whim...\" Nada couldn't take anymore. She threw her head back as hard as she could and bashed Swackhammer right on the side of his face. He roared in anger, dropping her in the process. She landed on her bottom and began to scramble up to her feet. She decided to make a quick get away towards the bridge up ahead, screaming, \"You disgusting piece of trash! You're a fiend! You're vile! I hope you burn in hell for thinking about doing such a low thing!\" Swackhammer growled with fury and dashed after her. Nada heard his large footsteps not far behind and panicked, only to trip over a large stone, hurting her ankle in addition. \"Ow!\", she cried out, falling onto her knees, scraping them. Without so much as a second, a large olive green hand clamped around her neck and hoisted her up, choking her. Her eyes widen in horror as the evil green alien snarled at her. \"You think you're clever enough to get away, you dumb broad?! Well, just watch! You'll be the first one to die!\" Nada felt the tight pressure of his hand squeezing the breath out of her body. Her mind started to get fuzzy and her whole being started to become numb. Suddenly, she heard Swackhammer roar in pain as he let go of her, her body hitting the hard ground of the bridge hard. Struggling to get her senses together and pushing herself up, she saw purple blood squirting out from a large gash that was now on his arm. Her eyes then took notice of another figure standing right in between her and the giant slime. Her spirits felt lifted as she smiled in relief, \"Kari! You're okay!\" Kari kept herself firm on the ground as Swackhammer continued screaming in agonizing hurt coming from his new open wound. \"Nada! You have to get up and go back! The others must be in the observation room! You have to help them!\" Nada shook her head with terrifying concern, \"No way! You're the one who needs help! You can't take him on by yourself! He'll hurt you!\" Kari shot a glance at her good friend, \"I'm not asking, Nada. Hurry! Blanko is worried sick about you! Go to him!\" Giving one last look at her friend, Nada nodded her head and darted her way past a screaming Swackhammer, making her way safely towards the platform. After seeing that her friend made it back safe and sound, Kari gave her attention once more to the menace before her. \"Looks like it's just you and me now.\" Swackhammer got the bleeding under control and glared up at her with a growl. \"How did you escape from my chambers, you little brat?!\" Kari gripped her sword and kept her gaze level with him, \"You had a secret trap door hidden in your room. Took a while, but I managed to get outside with some help. Your pesky robots weren't of much trouble to deal with either.\" His eyes widen in realization. \"YOU were the one who took my entire army out?! I thought it was one of your snotty friends who managed to get an inside man into my fortress!\" Kari shook her head, \"Sorry, bozo. Didn't see any of my friends up until now, who you just tried to kill!\" She readied herself as the giant got back up on his feet. He scoffed and grinned an evil toothy grin, \"It's a shame. You could have become my queen and ruled by my side. It's not too late, you know. All you have to do is surrender yourself to me and if you ask nicely, I might just spare your allies and only torture them a little.\" The auburn haired teen glared daggers at him and spat, \"Screw you.\" A rumbling laugh escaped from his large form, smiling wickedly at the young woman, \"Should have stayed in my room if that was the case. I would have no problems with that! Hell, we could do that right NOW! \" Without warning, he dove at her and pinned her down to the ground, his massive form trapping her small slender one. Her sword went sliding a foot or two away from her, almost hitting the center edge of the narrow bridge. His large gruesome hands gripped her wrists tightly and his legs were in between hers, keeping her from getting any ideas about hitting him below the belt. \"Get off of me!\", she shrieked, struggling to pry herself free from him, but with zero success. Swackhammer licked his lips and grinned widely at his captive. \"Trust me, I'm already getting off at this...\" Kari felt her heart kick up in speed as panic filled her. 'NO! Dammit! Hale! SAVE ME!' Just as quickly as her mind cried for her brother, a loud crack echoed through the air, followed by a bellowing sound of pain. The giant alien tumbled backwards gripping onto his head, allowing Kari release and use of her limbs. She quickly looked up at the offender who attacked the huge menace, and breathed out gratefully, \"Hale!\" Hale was gripping tightly onto a giant gray and black sledgehammer with a dragon engraved near the top where the anvil of the hammer was at. He gave a deadly glare at Swackhammer's howling form, his teeth clamped together as his countenance was contorted in fiery rage, \"Don't you DARE ever touch my little sister, you cocky bastard !\" He glanced down at his sister, taking her sword from the loop of his belt strap and held it out towards her. \"Are you okay, Kari?!\" Kari nodded her head and took her weapon from her brother. \"Yeah. Thank you, Hale. Now let's teach this guy a lesson once and for all, huh?\" Hale grimaced as his gazed averted back towards the oversized creep. \"Sounds like a plan.\" Both siblings got ready as the alien struggled back up on his feet. His red gaze fell angrily on both siblings. \"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU BOTH!\" He charged immediately towards the two teens like a mad bull running towards a red banner being waved at him. Hale and Kari quickly lept out of his way. Hale swung his sledgehammer and smacked him hard against his broad back. Kari took another swing as he was charging at them and left another gash right across his chest. The force of both attacks sent the giant tumbling forward and crashed down hard into the center of the bridge. No sooner did all three felt the bridge begin to sway and crumble below their feet. Hale and Kari looked towards each other in a state of panic and realization at their new predicament. \"Hale, what's happening?!\" Hale remembered what Bupkus' words were before he took off and looked over at his sister in wide eyed horror. \"The bridge! It's going to break down! Kari, we gotta go now!\" The young girl nodded at her brother and both of them made a break for it, running towards the platform. On the end of the bridge where the platform was, Nawt and the rest of both groups opened the door and met their eyes with relief, only soon to be replaced with new-found horror. \"KARI! HALE! BEHIND YOU!\", Nawt screeched at the two kids while pointing his finger at the object of their other problem. Swackhammer was back on his feet, no more than a few feet away from both children. The bridge was already crumbling from the center and breaking down towards both directions, sending heavy debris dropping down hundreds of feet towards sharp jagged rocks that lay below them. The bridge was falling apart far too quickly and caught up to both Swackhammer and the two siblings. Their weapons dissipating once more into energy, brother and sister grabbed one anothers hand and made a jump for it as the once solid ground under their feet crumbled away into nothing. The Tunes, Monstars, and human girls screamed in terror. \"NO!\", the red Monstar cried out. Nawt, along with some of the Monstars and Tunes looked over the edge, praying for a miracle. Thankfully, Hale and Kari were but a couple feet away, dangling off of some of the edges of rock that broke from the broken bridge. Nawt let out a shaky sigh of relief, with Elise catching a glimpse and smiled joyfully, \"Oh thank heavens!\" But happiness didn't come as soon as everyone had hoped. Kari slipped with a cry, as lo and behold, Swackhammer had a grip around her ankle. Hale made a quick grab for it, and took a hold of his sister's hand. \"Kari! Let her go, you creep!\", the boy shouted frantically. Swackhammer chortled cynically, \"If I go, she's coming with me!\" Pound, Bang, and Nawt grabbed onto Hale for further assistance. \"This guy doesn't know when to give up!\", Bang muttered angrily. \"He's not dead yet?! Oh, what are we gonna do?!\", Nada exclaimed while clinging onto Blanko for support from her weakened state. Bugs looked like he had a light bulb light up above his head. \"I got an idea, docs!\" He pulled Daffy over and whispered his plan into his ear. The black mallard smiled mischievously, \"Oh, yes! I like where this is going!\" Bugs let Lola in the plan, and she nodded in confirmation to her boyfriend. \"Let's do it and quickly!\" Bugs winked at her, \"You got it, toots!\" In no time at all, both he and the female hare dug a hole into the ground, while Daffy went over to Wile. \"Sthay there, Wile? You got any dynamite on you?\" Wile took a moment then gave a mischievous grin of his own as he pulled out his last stick of dynamite that he had on him. \"Thanks!\", he saluted then went his way over to where the Monstars were helping the two teens from their untimely demise. Hale was loosing his grip on his sister, as the additional weight of Swackhammer was too much for him to handle. Out of nowhere, Daffy appeared next to him and looked down at the dangling bunch. \"Sthay there, Wacko! Looks like you could use a nice cigar!\" Before Swackhammer could retort, Daffy stuffed the dynamite stick into his mouth, which was already lit up. The villain's eyes widen and before anyone knew it, the stick exploded right in his face! His grip on Kari went loose and fell down to the spiky pit that lay below, his fate now sealed for good. Kari was relieved at the sudden lightness after his deadweight body released her, but once again, another surge of panic filled everyone as Hale's grip on her was failing. Suddenly, his hand gave out and she slipped through his fingers. Hale's, Nawt's, Daffy's, and everyone's eyes widened in horror as Kari started making her fall down as well. \"KARIIIIIII!\", Hale screamed, as he watched his sister falling. Kari squeezed her eyes shut as she began plummeting towards her impending doom, screaming her lungs out. Just then, two pairs of arms popped out of the rocky structure of the totaled bridge's underside and took firm hold of each of Kari's arms. She gasped as she snapped both eyes open to see Bugs and Lola holding her tightly. \"Easy there, doc. We gotcha!\", Bugs said as he smiled his bucktooth smile. Everyone above sighed in absolute relief at the sight. The three Monstars pulled Hale up, while Bugs and Lola came back out of the hole in the ground with Kari in tow. Cleaning of the dirt from her clothes, Kari gave Bugs and Lola hugs of thanks and smiled warmly. \"Thank you both. You saved me from quite the fall!\" Bugs chuckled and began munching on a carrot he pulled out of nowhere. \"Don't mention it! You would do the same for any of us!\" Lola nodded. \"Yeah. It was all Bugs' idea!\" She leaned over and kissed her rabbit boyfriend on the cheek, causing him to blush at the notion. Kari then glanced up and smiled at her brother and rushed over to him for an embrace. \"Thank you, Hale. You're the best brother I could ever ask for!\" Hale returned the embrace with equal happiness. \"I'm supposed to. It's the job of a big brother; to take care of their little sister, right?\" She giggled and pulled back, nodding with a bright smile. Looking over to the side, she bent down and ruffled Daffy's feathers on his head. \"Thank you too, Daffy. You got that guy off us for good!\" The black mallard shrugged bashfully. \"Aw, shucks. It wasth nothin', really. You guys are the real heroes here. You put up quite the fight against him!\" Everyone all cried and whooped in agreement at the mallard's statement. Elise ran up to Kari and hugged her. \"I'm so glad you're safe!\" Kari grinned happily. \"I'm glad both you and Marie are safe too.\" Pulling back, Elise turned her attention to Hale and jumped on him, giving him a big hug. Hale flushed bright red, and after a moment of registering the info, embraced her back. Then when he least expect it, she kissed him gently on the cheek, causing Hale to flush an extra shade of red. Everyone around them gave out whoops and whistles, to which Kari flashed a grin toward her big brother at. Hale smiled back then pulled slightly away from Elise, bestowing a gentle kiss to her lips. This time, everyone gave louder cheers and Daffy blew a couple of poppers and streamers to further congratulate the new couple. As everyone was busy cheering Hale and Elise with their PDA, Kari looked over to where Nada was, who was gently holding on to Blanko as they shared a kiss of their own. Kari couldn't help but laugh softly at the sight. \"It's about time they had their moment. Each of them.\" A sudden gentle tug at her arm caught her by surprise and off guard as Nawt pulled her over to the side into an embrace of his own. No one was paying attention to them as they shared a loving stare with one another, joined again in anothers arms. Nawt then brought up his left hand and cupped the side of her face lovingly. \"Thank God you're safe. I thought he was.. I thought you might have.. that he would have..\", his voice began breaking. The young woman brought up her hand and placed it gently on his. \"He didn't. Now, he never will. Not ever. I'm always yours, just as you're always mine.\" He smiled warmly at her and pulled away slightly for a brief moment. He dug into his pocket and pulled out her bracelet; the very one he made just for her six years ago. She gasped softly as he gently took her left hand and snapped the bangle on her wrist, the crystal engraved rose shining brightly in front of both of them. Her gaze went back up to his as he gazed back at her with a toothy smile. Leaning down towards her, pulling her into their tight embrace once more, he sealed his lips completely over hers in a passionate kiss. After a long moment, they pulled apart for some air, as well as other matters at hand. They both looked over at their friends, who were all looking over at them with smirks and smiles. Pound was the one who spoke up to break the silence. \"Let's go home, people. We got to celebrate this!\" Everyone cheered in agreement and started making their way down the tower and towards the ship. It only took a few minutes for Bupkus and Pound to get the ship up and running again for their journey back home. All the Tunes, human teens and Monstars boarded the ship as it was getting ready for take off. As soon as they began shooting out into the starry space before them, Daffy pulled out a remote control, as well as Wile. Mika was the first one to notice as she cradled Marie to sleep in her purple blanket. \"What in the world are those for?\" Everyone turned over to the two Tunes, who were both smiling mischievously. \"Let's just sthay what's past is past and Hakuna Matata! Ready, Wile?\" Wile snickered and nodded, as both of them pressed the buttons on their remotes. \"BOMBS AWAY!\", the black duck hollered proudly. A loud booming explosion caught everyone off guard as they looked into the mirrors and saw Moron Mountain being blown into pieces of rock. After a moment of utter silence, everyone, even in the pilot room, gave a loud cheer and screams of joy. Hale and Elise laughed merrily, Nada and Blanko smiled at one another with great relief. Nawt squeezed Kari's hand lightly while grinning and laughing. She couldn't help but laugh herself. The nightmare was all over at long last. Now there's definitely going to be something to celebrate once they get home, aside from getting the chance to throw Wile and Daffy into the air for their secret of planting the remaining explosives around the once gloomy solace called Moron Mountain. Kari looked over at Hale, who shot her a wide grin from ear to ear. She grinned right back with gusto. 'Looks like we're gonna have the party off the century when we get back home, alright!'[Chapter 22] Alas! My pretties, we have reached the second to last chapter of Space Jam: Resonance. Do not fret! I am for certain making another sequel to this as well. It just might have to wait until after I do my Batman fanfic for Arkham City. This will be all giggles and awes in this chapter (and some steamy romantic goodness! ;) ). I own nothing but my OCs. I do not own Nada Sampson, as she belongs rightfully to MonstarzGirl. I also do not own Warner Bros or the Looney Tunes or the Monstars (if I did, then this would have been the movie itself instead of a simple fanfic, as well as the prequel Revisioned). The only warning I give is the steamy romance that will appear. Enjoy! Third Person POV: After a good three hour voyage, the Monstars' ship finally landed safely back into Looney Tune Land territory. Mostly everyone took naps and slept throughout the trip, as exhaustion blanketed over them from all the mayhem that had occurred. Once they landed, Bupkus' voice sounded through the intercom, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your co-pilot speaking. We have just arrived at our final destination, Looney Tune Land. Everyone may now please remove their seat-belts and prepare to disembark off the ship. Thank you and enjoy your evening!\" Mika carefully undid her seat-belt and got up with a sleeping Marie in her arms. Lexi got up and went over to the young African-American. \"How is she?\" Mika smiled at the tiny sleeping tot. \"Sleeping like a baby, of course. Poor girl was out of it!\" Marie cooed in her sleep contently, resulting in both older females giggling and awing. They joined the rest of the crowd as one by one, they exited the ship in a single file line. The sky was mixed with hues of red, orange, blue, and purple, indicating that it was only early evening. Bang glanced up at the sky with a smile shortly before frowning, \"How come the sky is never green , huh?\" Maddie came up next to him and hugged his huge muscular arm, \"Don't sweat it, big guy. You're all the green this gal could ever need.\" He glanced down at the rebellious teenager and smiled. \"Guess you're right!\" Blanko helped Nada out of the ship with extreme care, not to further injure her ankle. She coughed then winced in pain. \"What's wrong, Nada?\", the blue wonder asked her in worry. \"I think I might have broken a rib.\" Just when they needed it, Elise came up to them, with Hale not far behind. \"Let me see where you're hurt.\" Lifting her hands up and pressing them gently on the spot where Nada pointed out her pain, Elise's hand began to glow a bright lime green, healing the sore right away. Nada and Blanko widen their eyes in surprise, a gasp escaping the moreno's lips, \"Hey! It's not hurting anymore!\" The gentle girl bent down and began to do the same with her friend's ankle, the swelling and soreness disappearing in a heartbeat. Nada pressed her foot down to apply pressure, relieved that her appendage is now fully recovered. Blanko smiled and looked down towards Elise with gratitude, \"Thanks for fixing her up.\" The shy girl smiled kindly. \"Not a problem.\" After Hale took Elise's hand and led her towards some of their other friends, Blanko pulled Nada up close to him in a warm enveloping hug. \"I'm glad you're safe now, Nada.\", he breathed into her ear. Nada flushed a light crimson before returning his comment with a peck on his lips. \"I'm glad you are too, Blanko. It seems like this crazy nightmare is finally over.\" He nodded back and smiled brightly. Bupkus took the liberty of taking a sleeping Marie out of Mika's arms and cradled her gently. Lexi walked up to him with a smirk. \"So I see you got a soft spot for babies, huh?\" Bupkus flashed a toothy smile at her and chuckled. \"This one's a special case. I'm just grateful that asshole didn't hurt her, along with the older two.\" Lexi nodded, understanding his concern. The blonde couldn't help but smile at the sight; almost as if he was like a father figure or guardian for the toddler. Mika walked up to her with a smile, \"What are you thinking about now, girl?\" She looked at her friend as Pound joined up with Bupkus, admiring the sweet bundle. \"You know, Mika? Reason being why I can't seem to like other guys at our school isn't cause they're not attractive or know how to play the role of Casanova. Nah.. Those things you can get even at the local mini-mart. But what you can't buy is a heart made of gold without the use of money or power. A good loving heart, with a strong, kind soul to go with it. Looks are just the bonus.\", Lexi breathed out shakily. Mika smiled in awe before shaking her head, understanding her tan comadre completely. She placed her hand on Lexi's shoulder as they both smiled and looked over at their Monstar counterparts,\"You got that right there, sister.\" Bugs, Lola, and Daffy stayed behind with the rest of their friends as the rest of the Tunes bade them all good night for the evening. It was a rest well-deserved for all of them, after all the hard work and effort they put through to help save their friends in distress. Hale and Elise approached the three of them with much gratitude weighed upon their shoulders. \"Bugs, Lola, Daffy... Thank you... for everything.\", Hale said with a generous smile. Bugs smiled back at the young man shook his head. \"It was all nothing, Doc! You guys have helped us way back! It's only fair enough to return the favor.\" Daffy smiled wryly, \"Those explosives were so worth it!\" Elise and Hale couldn't help but let out a hearty laugh. Lola glanced around in search of something, \"Hey Hale, where's your sister and Nawt?\" Nawt and Kari came up to the group, hand in hand. \"Right here. Don't worry, we didn't run off anywhere!\", Kari smiled contently at her brother and their friends. Nawt took another look at the sky and noticed it was already getting dark. \"It's getting late, Kari.\", he said to his girlfriend. Kari gave a pout, \"Aw! So soon?\" Bugs smiled at the two, \"Hey now, docs! Why don't you all stick around here for the night? I'm sure the guys won't mind having a few extra guests over.\" He looked over at Nawt, who raised his brows and smiled at the idea. \"Sounds like a plan! Let me go check with Pound, just to be sure if he's cool with it.\" \"No need to!\", a deep voice boomed behind them. The rest of the Monstars and the girls walked up to them, smiles decorating their faces. \"Say, Bugs? You wouldn't mind if you, Lola, and Daffy could go get us an extra set of clothes and pajamas for us though, would you?\", Nada asked gently. Bupkus also spoke up, \"Don't forget Marie's teddy bear and other stuff. Poor girl must have felt neglected!\" He gently stroked the baby's back with loving tenderness. Bugs shrugged, \"Don't see why not! Ready to go get their things then head home, Lola?\" Lola giggled and nodded. Daffy crossed his arms in resistance, but failed miserably. \"Oh, fine! Let's go get some packing done!\" With that said, the three Tunes took off in a hole Bugs created along with Lola to go and retrieve the teen's belongings. Pound smirked to the rest of the group, \"Let's head on over to base, boys and girls! Tomorrow's party time!\" They all cheered and started making their way over to Monstar Manor. Upon arriving at the Monstars' abode, Marie woke up with a mewl, followed by a whimper. Bupkus took note of it immediately, knowing she was hungry. \"Shh.. Don't cry, cutie pie! Kitty's here!\" He began to rock Marie gently in his arms, stopping her from crying. \"I hope Bugs and the other two get here soon with our stuff, as well as Marie's things.\", Lexi muttered hopefully. Like the answer to her plea, the three Tunes popped into the room from under the carpet with duffel bags filled with each individual's things. Bupkus took the sippy cup from Marie's baby bag and gave it to her, which was filled with apple juice. The tiny tot squealed happily, chugging the drink to her heart's content. Bugs grinned widely at the whole group, \"Hope that's everything for you guys! Well, time for us to call it a day! See you all tomorrow!\" With a wave of his gloved paw, Bugs made his way out the door with Lola and Daffy behind him. The whole group waved them good byes for the time being, with Pound voicing the tiredness that swept over them. \" I think it's time we all hit the hay ourselves. Ladies, feel free to use the bathrooms for showers.\" The girls all took turns to rinse and clean themselves, scrubbing off the dirt and grime from their bodies. Kari was first to finish and took the liberty of giving Marie a nice bubble bath in the tub. After cleaning the tiny girl, she toweled her dry and dressed her in her purple pajamas with gray fat cats printed all over the pants and shirt. Once the toddler was clean, she brushed hers and the two year old's teeth, then got the child ready for bed. Bupkus vouched again to have Marie with him, not feeling comfortable of leaving her alone anytime soon. Kari happily complied and handed the tiny child over to the purple giant, who was thrilled to have the now snoozing toddler in his arms once more. Lexi sauntered over, now clean of any hint of dirt and her hair flowing freely around her shoulders, smiling at the Monstar. Bupkus peeked over at the corner of his eye, then did a double-take at her, eyes wandering up and down at her. She was sporting a lavender silk spaghetti strap nightgown that went down to her ankles with fuzzy white flip flop slippers, her hair completely loose and cascading down to the small of her back. She took note of how he was looking at her and blushed. Kari noticed the tension between the two and decided to take her leave. \"Well, good night you two! See ya in the morning!\" She skipped away merrily before either of them had the chance to speak up. Lexi looked over at Marie with a small smile. \"She's all tuckered out, huh?\" Bupkus looked down momentarily at the bundle in his arms before raising his gaze back up, \"Yeah. Poor thing's all washed out. Gonna take her in with me in a few.\" Lexi felt her heart swell at the sweet notion. If there's one thing she loved about Bupkus, it's his kind nature behind his \"tough guy\" facade. Taking in a breath, she walked up to him and gently pulled him down towards her. He bent down, careful as to not hurt Marie. What he got next almost made his mind blow out of his head; Lexi kissed him right square on the lips. Her eyes were closed, enjoying the brief moment with her favorite Monstar. It took Bupkus a few moments until he began to slowly close his eyes and relax into the kiss. After a few moments, they pulled apart, opening their eyes at one another with soft smiles on their faces. \"Sleep tight and sweet dreams, Lexi.\", Bupkus breathed out happily. \"You too, Hon. See you in the morning.\" Lexi turned and made her way towards the bedroom that she and Mika were going to share for the night. Mika was leaning on the frame of the doorway, smiling at the scene. Mika was in a giant magenta tee shirt with a large picture of Tweety on the front, and wore orange shorts. Lexi smiled at her friend with glee. \"What? He's a sweet guy!\" Mika let out a small laugh. \"I know. I already gave my boo his good night kiss.\" They glanced over at Pound, who had lipstick marks all over his face, making his way to his bedroom with a goofy grin. The two girls looked back at each other and let out a mellow laugh as they got in the room and closing the door behind them. As Bupkus closed the door behind him, he looked down at the sleeping girl in his arms with the biggest smile he could muster. \"Guess I'm lucky to have two beautiful girls now in my life, huh cutie?\" His only response was her soft breathing, followed by a content yawn. He chuckled and made his way to his bed with his little bundle of joy, ready for some sleep himself. Bang and Maddie sat around in Bang's room, laughing and contending themselves to each others company. Maddie was wearing army green camouflage pants with a matching shirt as her set of pajamas. \"Man, did you see the look on his face when Daffy put the dynamite in his mouth?\" 'Looks like you could use a cigar!' Hah!\", Maddie shrieked with glee at the earlier victory the black duck won them during the battle. Bang shook his head while gasping for breath, tears streaming down the sides of his eyes. \"No kidding! That duck needs to be dragged into a mosh pit! He's a freaking genius!\", he rolled to his side, laughing his heart out. Maddie calmed her tirade down and sighed, smiling at the green alien in front of her. Bang calmed down soon after and looked over at her, his eyes sparkling with happiness at the girl in front of him. \"Well, I think we should call it a night. Besides, we got a huge party to celebrate tomorrow!\", Maddie got up from his bed, heading towards the door. Bang raised a brow and got up to follow her, but then stopped. Maddie noticed his heavy footsteps halted and looked over at him in concern,\"Bang? What's up?\" Bang opened and closed his mouth before taking a deep breath and letting it out again. Maddie turned her body to face him, raising her brow. After a short moment, Bang cleared his throat, \"I, uh.. Well, if you would like..\" Maddie leaned closer, \"What is it?\" Bang rocked back and forth on the balls of his heels then asked while looking away, a flush of pink coloring his cheeks, \"Wanna stay here with me, you know, for the night? Nothing serious or bad or anything.. um.. just sleep! Like, uh, you know, cuddle and uh, taking a nap for the whole night.. or..\" Before he could say anything else, he was met with a colliding force as Maddie embraced him the tightest she could. \"You big dork! Of course I'll sleep over in your room with you! You know, you're pretty cute when you act so shy.\" She met his face with a wide grin. Bang took a moment to register the information before he cracked a huge grin of his own. \"Only for the best!\", he said happily. She laughed at his comment with eagerness, \"You know it!\" Blanko helped Nada in the other room get ready for bed. Nada smiled happily at her blue beau, as he took off the bed spread and fluffed her pillows for her. \"All set, Nada.\", He grinned over at the raven haired girl, who returned the expression with gratitude. \"Thank you, Blanko. You're very kind to help me, even though I'm not hurt anymore. You're so sweet.\" He blushed at her words while rubbing the back of his neck. As Nada got herself under the covers, Blanko got out of his stupor, remembering something. \"Oh, Nada! I almost forgot!\" He bent down to the bedside next to the night-table and picked up a box. Nada gazed at the box in wonderment. \"For me? Oh, Blanko.. You shouldn't have..\", she smiled as he handed the box over to her. He smiled and egged her on. \"Go on ahead. Open it. It's something I was meaning to give to you for quite some time.\" Her eyes flashed over to him before settling back onto the box now resting on her lap. It was a fair sized blue box, with an emerald green ribbon tied around it and into a perfect bow. Carefully, she pulled on the bow, letting it come undone. 'It feels like silk!' , she thought to herself, planning to keep the green bow as a bonus gift. Setting the soft material to the side, she carefully lifted up the lid of the box, letting the sides of the box to fall apart to the sides. She gasped in wonderment, her eyes becoming watery at the sight in front of her. A ceramic pot decorated with little blue aliens all around it and inside it, a lovely bouquet of blue forget-me-nots, nestled in dry soil. She brought her hands up to her quaking lips, tears forming in her eyes. Blanko started to panic a bit, \"H-hey! What's wrong? I thought you liked forget-me-n..\" He was caught off as Nada pulled him into a tight embrace, her light sobs filled with joy. \"I love it, Blanko! It's perfect! Thank you, thank you!\" Blanko let out a breath he didn't know he was holding in and smiled. \"Anytime. I knew those would make you happy.\" She pulled away and nodded, \"Oh, yes. They do; just like my favorite guy makes me happy. No matter what.\" They smiled warmly at one another and shared a chastise kiss before bidding one another good night. As Blanko left the room closing the door behind him, Nada placed the pot full of forget-me-nots on the night-table next to her, smiling warmly at it before turning off the lights. Elise had on her blue nightgown, which looked similar to that of Wendy Darling's from Peter Pan, only with small white lilies printed all over it. She was fluffing up her pillows when she heard a knock on the door frame. She turned to see Hale leaning over, smiling at her. \"How are you feeling?\", he asked her. Elise smiled brightly at him. \"Never better. You?\" He walked in and took a breath. \"A lot better, actually. I'm glad you, Marie, and my sister are safe.\" She nodded and sat down on her bed, motioning him to join her. He complied and took a seat next to her. \"So what's really on your mind, Hale?\", she asked with a smile adorning her features. Hale looked over at her and locked his eyes with hers. \"In all honesty, hoping that things get back to normal.. well, in a way. Not everything in our lives are normal. Not anymore.\" Elise let out a giggle. \"I know what you mean. School, your parents, Nada's parents and grandmother; in short, our everyday life in motion. But there's something else, is there?\" Hale smiled and surrendered. \"Yeah. I have another girl in my life to look after now, aside from my cousin and sister... and I'm looking right at her.\" He leaned in towards her and planted a kiss on her lips, only with more firmness. Elise closed her eyes, feeling like she's on cloud nine. For so long, she has had a crush on Hale, and never once did she imagine that her dream would become a reality. After a minute or so, they pulled apart, both of their faces flushed. \"Hope you have a good night's rest, Elise. Tomorrow's gonna be a big day for all of us.\", he smiled as he got up, the bed slightly creaking at lifting his weight off of it. As he made his way out and was about to close the door, he stopped momentarily before turning his head to face her, \"There's something else I got to tell you, too. Something I've been meaning to say.\" Elise raised her brows and tilted her head to the side, \"Really? What's that?\" Hale gazed at her sincerely and smiled a warm smile, \"I always liked you too. Ever since we met.. Just never had the courage to admit it.\" Elise felt her eyes water as she smiled a heartfelt smile at him. \"Hale.. Thank you. Good night and sleep well.\" He nodded before closing the door behind him. Upon making his way to his room, he stopped by Kari's room to check on her. The door was wide open, so he peered inside. Kari sat on her bed, admiring her bracelet. Hale knocked on the door lightly, startling her from her reverie. \"Oh! Hey there, Hale! Going to bed already?\" \"Yeah, just finished checking on Elise.\" Kari beamed at him. \"Ooh la la! Well, aren't you the lucky guy?\" Hale made a face then smiled. \"Shut up. Now I have another girl to look on after. More work for me.\", he laughed. Kari shook her head and laughed as well. Hale glanced up at his sister, then looked down at her bracelet on her left wrist. \"Did you say good night to Nawt yet?\" Kari looked down at her bracelet too. \"Not yet. I will in a moment.\" After a good while of silence between them, Hale inhaled then exhaled deeply, saying words he never thought of saying aloud, \"He's gained my full trust.\" Kari snapped her head up, eyes wide. \"Huh?\" Hale looked down at his sister and scowled, \"Don't 'huh' me. I said I trust him with you entirely. If there's anyone out there who can be trusted to take care and look after you aside from me, it's Nawt. You were right all along, even back six years ago. I just didn't feel like acknowledging it.\" Kari was still registering all of what her brother said, then a smile quickly grew on her face. Hale took notice of her cheshire grin and quickly added with a finger pointed upright, \"But that doesn't mean you guys can get away with running off and being sneaky! I'm still your big brother, so I'm still gonna watch over you, got it?\" Kari gave into a fit of girlish giggles and nodded, smiling brightly, \"Got it!\" The older sibling smiled warmly at his sister then started making his way out of her bedroom. \"Night, sis.\" Kari smiled, her heart brimming with joy, \"Night, bro.\" As she heard him reaching the end of the hall and closing himself in his room, she glanced down once more at the bauble on her wrist. The rose shined beautifully under the light, looking ever so glossy and brilliant in its splendor. She stared at it for a few minutes before clicking it off carefully and looking on the underside of it. There, in brilliant cursive lettering: \"Forever Together: Kari & Nawt\" , shone right in front of her. Without another moments hesitation, she took the bangle in her hand and made her way out of the room and down towards the other end of the hall, where Nawt's room was. Nawt laid about on his grand poster bed, staring at the ceiling for quite a while. He was glad they were all finally rid of Swackhammer once and for all, and with a lifetime guarantee to boot! He still couldn't believe also the nasty revelation of his dead ex-boss' intentions towards his girlfriend. The thought of it still made his blood boil. 'I'm glad he's gone for good. He was pure evil. Kari could have almost been..' , he shuddered at the thought, pushing it to the very far depths of his mind, 'Well, what matters is that she's safe now. Her, Marie, and Elise.' His thoughts then drifted off to Kari, letting his mind wander a little more than he would have allowed in a more sober state. 'Of course, no one else can have her. Not to brag or anything, but I am a lucky guy to have her. She's mine.. Lord, if I could have a good moment of privacy with her, even just for one night.. No. Got to keep myself together! … Well, she did grow in all the right places...' , he groaned, grabbing a throw pillow and shoving it in his face. \"I'm in trouble.\", he mumbled to himself. It wasn't all intentional. He was a guy . He couldn't help himself! He sighed in defeat. \"Still... if I could spend at least one night of privacy with her.. I wouldn't do it for carnal pleasure. But I would like her to know how I truly feel about her.\" Just like an answer to his prayer, a small knock on his door followed by Kari's light voice caught his full undivided attention, \"Nawt? Are you awake? It's me, Kari.\" He automatically got up and swiftly went to the door, opening it. \"Hey there, sweetheart. What are you doing still awake?\", he asked with a smile. Kari smiled back warmly, \"Couldn't sleep. Actually, I was wondering...\" She looked down bashfully, her toes now becoming of interest to her all of a sudden. Nawt tilted his head, curious as to what her plea was going to be. \"Wondering what? You can tell me.\" Still looking down at her toes, Nawt gently cupped her chin and tilted it up, their eyes locked on to one another. \".. Um, can I.. stay with you? For tonight?\" Nawt wasn't expecting that. His eyes kept level with hers, searching for sincerity, even though he knows it's already there. He smiled at her. \"Sure thing, love.\" He gently pulled her into his room and closed the door behind them. The light in his room was slightly dim, although if he chose to, he could have made it brighter. \"So what is it? Is something wrong? Swackhammer isn't coming back, Kari. He's gone for sure this time.\" He could tell she was holding back on something. Nawt's gaze soon went down to the bangle in her hand. Despite it being a bit dark, he could still see it clear as day. \"Nawt. You gave this bracelet to me with a promise. A promise that's even marked onto it.\", she started, her gaze fixed on her jewelry. Nawt nodded, feeling tingly inside for some odd reason. \"Yes. I did.\" Kari took in a shaky breath before continuing, \"I.. I want to know...\" His eyes snapped up at her. \"You want to know..?\", he repeated, his heart beating quickly and his palms becoming sweaty. ' Did the temperature just go up a bit?' , he thought to himself, feeling small beads of sweat running down his forehead. He had a feeling where this was going, and in all sake of what's good and pure in this world, he hoped his gut was right. Kari then lifted her gaze from the bracelet and locking to his, not once faltering. \"I want to know how you feel. What is it you want to express? Cause I...\", she broke off, feeling the words getting stuck in her throat, along with a lump. Nawt walked over to her, his eyes looking into her bare soul, just as he knows she was looking into his. \"What I feel.. is something I can't put into words so easily, Kari. You know I love you and always will, but it's not the same by just saying it. As for what I want to express, well...\", he swallowed and whispered to her, \".. I would have to show you .\" Kari leaned in closer to him, his body heat radiating off of him, like the warmth of the sun. Their faces were only a few centimeters away from one anothers. Kari breathed, her eyes becoming half lidded. \"If you show me.. then can I... can I show you too? \" Nawt felt his heart skip a few beats, and felt a very familiar sensation as well that he was trying to put control over on his body. His breathing began to quicken and his eyes became heavy with the more stronger version of love.. lust. He took her into his embrace and gently took the bracelet out of her hands. He placed it on his night-table next to them, then brought back his arm and wrapped it firmly around her. He brought his right hand up and cupped the side of her face, his eyes not once leaving hers. She snaked her arms up around the back of his strong neck, bringing herself closer to his larger frame. She could feel his rock hard chest pressed up against her softer one, leaving no space left in between them. He could hear her gasp lightly as she felt his pelvic bone digging into hers, a low, hoarse growl escaping his throat. Gripping her a bit more tightly, he lightly brushed his lips over hers, making her shudder with delight. He mentally took note of that, seeing that she was enjoying this just as much as he was. Their eyes glanced at one another once more, before closing slowly as their lips caressed one another and sealed into a searing kiss. His right hand took a gentle but firm grip on her short locks, his thumb gently stroking her cheek. His left arm kept her pinned to his solid form, his free hand running up and down from the back of her shoulder blades to nearly the base of her tailbone. It then slipped completely around her and gently stroked her side, making her shudder even more. Her hands gently massaged the strong muscles of his neck, causing him to moan in pleasure. She then gently brought her hands down to his bare chest and began tracing her fingers down, feeling his pectorals. Nawt couldn't help but let out a long groan and tilted her head slightly, his tongue begging for entrance. Kari complied with gusto and felt his tongue slither into her mouth and began dancing with hers. Nawt felt his eyes roll into the back of his skull. He growled possessively and gently pushed her down onto his bed. Their bodies laid sprawled completely on the bed, him on top of her. His hands gently traveled up and down her body, gliding up her flat stomach, to her sides and over to her back with ease. Her hands mimicked his and went to his back, pulling him down towards her. Kari arched her back, their bodies closing into each other once more. They pulled apart for a second for breath before diving back into another deep and sensual kiss. Nawt kept one hand on her back, and brought down his right hand down her side and onto her leg, caressing the tight muscles of her thigh. She raised her leg in a reclining position, allowing his hand to rest firmly on the underside of her thigh. His hips shifted slightly against hers. Kari snaked her arms up once more around his neck, as his mouth continued ravaging hers with a deeply filled and fiery desire. His hand traveled back up her thigh and up her side, sliding back under arching back. After a few more moments of tongue wrestling, shuddering moans of delight, and tender caressing, they pulled apart, taking in lungfuls of air. Their eyes were still slightly glazed with their burning desire for one another, but both knew that the rest will have to wait until later; way later. Smiling, Nawt kissed her forehead and whispered lightly to his lover, \"Now you got an idea of just how you make me feel. I love you, Hikari. Don't ever doubt that.\" Kari smiled lovingly back at him, placing a chastise kiss on his lips. \"Yeah, and now you got an idea too about how I feel. I love you very much, Nawt.\" Both stayed in each others embrace as Nawt pulled the covers over them both and then slightly turned over to turn off his light. He took one last look at the bracelet next to the light on his night-table, smiling with heartfelt satisfaction. 'This is a promise I intend to keep.' He turned off the light, pulling his soul-mate closer to him as sleep overtook them both.[Chapter 23] This is it! The final chapter to \"Resonance\"! It's been a pleasure writing this story, just like it's predecessor, and I look forward to doing a sequel for this one as well in the future! Ladies and gents.. Chapter 23, at your leisure. I own nothing except my OCs. I do not own the songs \"Welcome to the Show\", by Britt Nicole, \"When We Stand Together\" by Nickelback (love the band btw), and \"Rock N Roll\" by Avril Lavigne. Enjoy! Kari's POV: The sun's rays were faintly peeking through the closed blinds of the bedroom window. I moaned softly, turning over away from the wall where the sun's brightness was bouncing off of. My eyesight was still fuzzy and my mind groggy. I snuggled into something warm.. and a bit hard. I came to on all five senses and snapped my eyes open. Glancing up, I saw a still asleep Nawt, his warm breath tickling my face. All the memories of last night came flooding back in one go. My heart sped up a bit and even skipped a few beats. I smiled, giggling at the butterfly feeling that was filling my entire body at that moment. It was also at that moment that I remembered that no one back home knows where we are, and chances are, we are all going to have to explain where we've gone for an entire day. Nawt began to stir and stretched with a yawn. His eyes cracked open and looked down at me, greeting me with a loving smile. \"Good morning, sweetheart.\" I smiled back. \"Morning, babe.\" His smile grew even wider at the mention of the pet name. \"Now that's a name that can get me in a mood.\" He leaned in and kissed me lightly on the lips. I couldn't help but laugh heartily. \"Easy there, tiger! I think we had enough for one night, wouldn't you say? Can't get too carried away, now. Hale will have both our heads if we do; besides, you've gained his full trust.\" He raised his brows at the news. \"Really?\" I nodded. Nawt did a silent cheer. \"Guess that means we don't have as much restrictions as we used to now!\" I let out a laugh. He can be so funny and cute. 'As long as we're never separated again and always together, nothing can tell us otherwise about our happiness...' A thought immediately crossed my mind, my eyes growing wide in realization. Nawt seemed to have taken notice and arched a brow in concern. \"What's wrong? Was it something I said?\" I shook my head and jumped out of bed, looking around for any paper and something to write. Nawt sat up, growing very curious. \"Whoa there, darling! What are you looking for?\" Finally finding some sheets of loose leaf notebook paper and a pen, I began scribbling down words. I heard the rustling of the sheets and groaning of the bed as Nawt got up and walked over to where I was leaning. The short silence was soon interrupted by a knock at Nawt's bedroom door. Hale's stern voice, along with Elise's gentle one, could be heard on the other side. \"Kari! I know you're in there! One of you better not be doing anything you guys shouldn't do!\" Nawt went to the door and opened it, smiling over at Hale. \"Morning, Hale. You're sis is over there at my desk scribbling down something.\" Hale walked in with Elise in tow, both she and Nawt bidding a friendly good morning to one another. Hale stood next to me, raising a stern brow. \"How come you weren't in your room at all last night, huh? You guys better not have-\", I broke him off, raising the two sheets of paper up to his face. His expression changed from stern to confused. \"What's this?\", he took the sheets and analyzed them. I beamed up at him. \"These are some more 'numbers' I thought we could use as a party favor, as well as an apology.\" Hale looked back up in surprise. \"An apology? I think I need a bit more than an apolo-\" I pulled him down and whispered in his ear. Hale's eyes widened as he pulled back, looking at me like I was some sort of demented crazy. \"You want us to do WHAT NOW?!\" Elise and Nawt both looked at us with wide eyes, shocked at his sudden outburst. I gave him a stern look of my own. \"Then what do you propose?\" Hale shook his head wildly, \"Well, the idea is good, but the location..! Kari, you know we can't bring them here! Bugs won't like it!\" Elise stepped in. \"What's wrong, Hale?\" Hale took a deep breath and sighed, \"Kari wants us to bring all of our folks down here, including yours and the other girls, as a way to explain to them our absence.\" Nawt's eyes almost boggled out of his skull, and Elise looked mildly surprised. \"But isn't Looney Tune Land supposed to be hidden? I doubt we can bring our parents over.\" Nawt suddenly looked like he had an idea of his own. \"Say, why don't you guys perform at the same place you guys did your show six years ago? I bet it's more easier, and we can all go there! Why not call your old teacher and ask him to get authorization to use the place for us?\" I gawked at Nawt, then a smile crept on my face. \"That's brilliant! Nawt, you're the best!\" I ran up to him and planted a big kiss on his cheek. Hale stared before coming back to earth and nodded. \"Alright. I'll call Folles up, but not until you tell me what the heck you two were doing last night!\" I looked over at him with a bright smile. \"Oh, you know: cuddling, kisses, the works.\" I giggled as I took off to tell the others of our plan, as well as getting washed up and dressed up. 'This is going to be one of the best celebrations yet!' Everyone gathered downstairs in the living room, waiting for the Tunes to arrive. Hale took a while to get himself ready for whatever reason and came down the stairs with a grin. \"Are they here yet?\" Pound shook his head. \"Not yet. Give another five minutes. Where have you been all this time, huh? You ran off pretty quick after breakfast.\" Hale looked over at me and grinned then looked back at Pound. \"Just had to do a quick errand.\" He went over and sat next to Elise on the long sofa, along with Blanko, Nada, Bang and Maddie. I held on to Nawt's hand, excitement going through my body. I took the liberty of phoning in Bugs and telling him about our plans, as well as letting him to know to bring in the rest of the gang. It all feels like deja vu, now that I thought about it. 'Just like it was years ago. Thank goodness Mr. Folles agreed to open up the community theater for us again and to do us the favor of phoning in all our parents to head on over there. I also heard he's looking forward to another performance of ours! This is all too exciting!' , I thought to myself with utmost glee. Nawt noticed my smile and whispered lightly in my ear. \"Excited, aren't ya?\" I nodded. At that moment, there was a knock on the front door. Bugs and the other Tunes arrived just on time. Pound opened the door and let them all in. \"Hey there, docs! Good to see you're all in high spirits! So, uh, what's this about an \"Ultimate Performance of a Lifetime\"?\" I smiled brightly, looking over at Hale. He grinned back and got up from the sofa. I got up and joined him, the both of us grinning at Bugs and the Tunes from ear to ear. \"Well, Bugs,\" Hale started up, \"Here's the plan..\" We finally arrived at the community theater inside the Monstars' ship. As we all started getting out, we could see all the cars of all our folks. Surprisingly, even our parents', our aunt's, and Nada's parents' cars. Nada gasped in relief. \"They're okay! Thank goodness.\" Blanko rubbed her shoulder in happy compliance. I looked over at Hale, grinning at him. \"I'm sure mom and dad may have an idea or two about where we went, huh Hale?\" He nodded. Bupkus held on to Marie, who was squealing with delight. The little toddler was dressed up in a cotton candy pink dress with white socks and black Mary-janes. Her hair was tied up in pig tails. Nada wore a sky blue top and a knee length black skirt with brown flip flops and had her hair in a braid. Hale was wearing an Arizona brand white tee with faded denim jeans and gray sneaks, his hair in its usual spiky fashion. Elise was wearing a yellow camisole over a white tank top and a pink skirt with white heeled sandals. Maddie wore a black tank top with a large yellow smiley face on it, with ripped jean shorts and black steal toed boots. Mika wore a peach colored strapless dress with orange sandals and a brown waist belt. Lexi was sporting dark denim skinny jeans with red high heels and a white loose shirt with a black camisole. She also wore a wooden bangle on her right wrist and her hair was let loose to the small of her back. I stood next to Nawt, wearing an A line tank top with a black and white striped skirt that went down to my mid-thigh with a pair of black stilettos. My bracelet that Nawt gave to me was on my left wrist, the crystal rose shining brightly under the bright sun. I looked over at Hale, determination taking over once again. \"Let's go.\" He nodded, as we all started making our way over to the theater. We met Mr. Folles right at the doors, who was looking down at his watch with a smile. \"You're on time! I take it it's just you and Kari who will perform?\" Hale and I nodded, although Hale put in some input, \"We would like to take Nada, Lexi and Maddie with us though. They have experience in musical instruments, after all.\" Our old teacher nodded. \"Alright. Be quick though; everyone's getting antsy in there. The rest of you may follow me.\", he directed to the Tunes, Monstars, Elise and Mika. \"Good luck, kids!\", Bugs commented with glee. Hale, Nada, Lexi, Maddie and I began to make our way to the back of the stage to start setting up our equipment. As we got our stuff together and got Nada in position with the keyboard, Maddie with the drums, Lexi with an ES, me with a Gibson, and Hale with a Les Paul, Hale pulled me over to the side. \"Hey, Kari. I want to do a number before we do yours.\" I glanced at him surprised. \"You wrote a song?\" He blushed and nodded. Taking out a sheet pf paper with words and music notes, he handed it over to me. I took it and looked it over, then looked back up to him and smiled. \"Alright, bro. We'll let you take center stage first.\" He smiled in appreciation. \"Thanks, Kari. Ready now, sis?\" We took our positions. Feeling my heart swell at the joy of all of us being together in all this, I looked back at him with new-found confidence, \"Ready as I'll ever be, bro!\" The curtains opened, and Hale signaled over to Maddie, who started up the drums, follow by his playing and Hale's strong voice taking over the mic, surprising us all. \" One more depending on a prayer And we all look away People pretending everywhere It's just another day There's bullets flying through the air And they still carry on We watch it happen over there And then just turn it off\" I joined in with him as we struck the chorus. The rhythm of the music affecting us all on stage and off. \" Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah We must stand together Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah There's no giving in Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah Hand in hand forever Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah\" We sung our chorus part as Hale took his main line. \" That's when we all win Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah That's, that's, that's when we all win That's, that's, that's when we all win\" Maddie hits the drums again, then getting back into tune. \" They tell us everything's alright And we just go along How can we fall asleep at night When something's clearly wrong When we could feed a starving world With what we throw away But all we serve are empty words That always taste the same\" This time, practically the entire audience joined in with us in chorus. \" Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah We must stand together Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah There's no giving in Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah Hand in hand forever Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah That's when we all win Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah That's, that's, that's when we all win That's, that's, that's when we all win The right thing to guide us Is right here inside us No one can divide us When the light is nearly gone But just like a heartbeat The drumbeat carries on\" Maddie played the drums in a steady beat, almost close to a musical heartbeat. \" And the drumbeat carries on\" Maddie steadily brought up the pace and started back with us into tune, chorus striking up one last time. \" Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah We must stand together Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah There's no giving in Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah Hand in hand forever Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah That's when we all win Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah That's, that's, that's when we all win\" Hale finished his last line, a smile shining over all. \" That's, that's, that's when we all win\" The audience burst into a loud applause. The parents seemed intrigued and overall, please at my brother's performance. I really couldn't believe it myself; Hale has just as much talent as I do! 'You're so talented, Hale! Wonder why you were hiding your talent all this time?' I then caught sight of him looking over at Elise, then caught on. It was his own gift to her, just like mine was for Nawt six years back. Hale then motioned me over, whispering in my ear. \"Stage is all your now, sis. Thanks.\" I nodded and took over Hale's position as front-man. \"\"Okay, everyone! This next one is going to be a run for your money! Girls, feel free to join me!\", I said over the mike, motioning to my band members to get themselves ready. I looked over at Nawt, mouthing the words, \"Here ya go, cowboy!\" I started up, voicing up for tempo, follow by the girls tuning in with their instruments. \" Let em know that we're still Rock n Roll\" Nada smiled brightly, as well as the other girls. Maddie had a 'hell yeah!' look written all over her face as she picked up on the drums. \" I don't care about my makeup I like it better with my jeans all ripped up Don't know how to keep my mouth shut You say so what (what) I don't care if I'm a misfit I like it better than the hipster of all shit I am the mother frickin' princess You still love me\" I could tell the girls were feeling the same thing as I was at that moment, including Mika and Elise. All of thee girls on stage, including those two out there with the audience, joined in with me in chorus. \" Some some how It's a little different when I'm with you You know what I really am On the phone You know how it really goes Some some way We'll be getting out of this Time one day You're the only that I Want with me You know how the story goes\" I struck up, singing as loud as I can, my heart being poured into the words. \" When it's you and me We don't need no one to tell us who to be We'll keep turning up the radio Well it's you and I Just put up a middle finger to the sky Let them know we're still rock 'n roll\" The girls joined in, including Lola, who was holding on to Bugs' hand. \" Rock n roll Hey hey hey Rock n roll Hey hey hey\" I went back to solo, smirking as I sung out the words. \" Don't get a bad attitude, dude I'm never going to cover up that tattoo I might have a couple issues You say me too (yeah) Don't care about a reputation Must be living in the wrong generation This is your invitation Let's get wasted\" The girls and I kicked in again, our voices ringing out throughout the entire theater. \" Some some how It's a little different when I'm with you You know what I really am On the phone You know how the story goes\" We strummed hard on the guitars, Hale getting into the tune as our voices rose again. \" When it's you and me We don't need no one to tell us who to be We'll keep turning up the radio What if you and I Just put up a middle finger to the sky Let them know we're still rock 'n roll Rock n roll Hey hey hey Rock n roll Hey hey hey\" We played out in full guitar and drums, up to a point. I sung out solo, lowering slightly a few notches. The girls strummed down a bit too, mellowing in. \" When it's you and me We don't need no one to tell us who to be We'll keep turning up the radio\" Finally, we struck in, going back up with all our might. \" What if you and I Just put a middle finger to the sky Let them know we're still rock 'n roll When it's you and me We don't need no one to tell us who to be We'll keep turning up the radio What if you and I Just put a middle finger to the sky Let them know we're still rock 'n roll\" I sung out the last part as loud as I could, the girls all backing me up with all their might. \" Rock n roll Hey hey hey Rock n roll Hey hey hey\" I went out with the final note, finishing up the song. Another loud burst of applause, hoots, and shouts came from the audience. Aunt Jackie looked over at Bupkus, who was still holding a very happy looking Marie, shouting over to him \"That's my niece and nephew up there!\" Bupkus smiled, \"I know! They're good kids!\" As the crowd settled down, I spoke up normally once again behind the mike, \"Thank you, everyone! Now, before we start the real fun, I want to say a few words to the folks out there. I would like to apologize for the long absence yesterday, as well as worrying any of you.\" Mutters of approval and appreciation came from the parents, who were all in some sort of understanding, to my relief. \"Thank you again. Now, we have one more number for you all! Trust me, you haven't seen anything yet! Ready, Hale?\" Hale gave a thumbs up, as we set aside bot our guitars, to everyone's surprise, including Nawt's. Hale placed on a wireless mic headset and handed over me one as well, as the crowd erupted into hoots and cheers once more. I motioned over at Nada, who nodded her head, and started playing the intro to our final act of the show with a fancy carnival piano tune which then turned into a nice play of electronic keys and Maddie's upbeat drumming. \" Now's the time, get in line, don't be afraid tonight We're gonna take you high, before you realize 'Round and 'round you'll go, up and down, never slow Feel the excitement grow, oh This is where you let go!\" Hale joined in with me, as we also got our bodies moving in with the beat. \" Hands high like a roller coaster This love is taking over Take us higher, here we go Oh, oh, oh Welcome to the show Gravity we're defying 'Cause we were made for flying We're about to lose control Welcome to the show\" I went on, this time solo. Colorful spotlights were switched on as the beat carried on. \" Oh. Welcome to the -! Oh, oh, we're on a mission Nothing, nothing, can stand in our way Oh, oh, we don't need permission We're gonna rise up and we'll be the change Oh, oh, hear us on your stereo Oh, oh, we're about to lose control Oh, oh, everybody knows Oh, oh, this is where you let go\" The chorus struck up again, Hale and I smiling as I spun towards him, our dance continuing. \" Hands high like a roller coaster This love is taking over Take us higher, here we go Oh, oh, oh Welcome to the show Gravity we're defying 'Cause we were made for flying We're about to lose control Welcome to the show\" This time, Hale and I got ready for showing off our moves. Thankful to mainly Nada, who helped us and gave us some spare lessons in dancing. \" And put your hands u-u-up We're gonna have some f-u-u-un We've only just beg-u-u-un And it's too late to r-u-un, you can't run So put 'em u-u-up We're gonna have some f-u-u-un Turn up the bass, let it b-u-u-ump We've only just begun, and you can't run\" We raised our hands up, the entire audience joining us in motion. We sung out in chorus once more for the rest, tuning down before the music shot back up in it's upbeat rhythm. We both then started one last dance routine, all the way to the very end. \" Hands high like a roller coaster This love is taking over Take us higher, here we go Oh, oh, oh Welcome to the show Gravity we're defying 'Cause we were made for flying We're about to lose control Welcome to the show Hands high like a roller coaster This love is taking over Take us higher, here we go Oh, oh, oh Welcome to the show Gravity we're defying 'Cause we were made for flying We're about to lose control Welcome to the show We're gonna have some f-u-u-un Turn up the bass, let it b-u-u-ump We've only just begun, and you can't run We're gonna have some f-u-u-un Turn up the base, let it b-u-u-ump We've only just begun, and you can't run!\" The entire area exploded into an uproar of happiness and amazement. The Tunes were off their rockers as they whistled, hooted and hollered words of satisfaction. The Monstars were just as surprised and stunned at the entire performance. Bang woo-hooed at all of us, especially at Maddie and her work on the drums. What a ham. Blanko applauded, a big goofy grin was spread all over his face like butter on toast at Nada, who blushed and waved at him and her parents. I think I also heard her grandmother out there, who wolf-whistled at the spectacle. Bupkus made a very loud wolf-whistle at Lexi, who winked and blew a kiss at him. Her parents were cheering for her, though I think we saw her dad catch a glimpse at the kiss she gave toward Bupkus and passed out at the sight. Mika, Elise and their parents were impressed at it all and gave us cheers of their own. Hale and I grinned as our mom and dad clapped and were teary with joy, even Aunt Jackie. Marie cooed and squealed, and cried out words we didn't expect, \"Kari! Hale!\" The Tunes, Monstars, Mika, Elise, and us on stage oggled at the toddler. Hale and I looked over at each other in surprise. \"She said our names! She actually said our names, Kari!\", Hale cried happily. I smiled warmly at our cousin, who was reunited once more with her mother. As we got offstage, Mr. Folles explained to us that he took the liberty of telling all our parents what Hale told him happened while we were away. As each of us were reunited with our families, we ran over and hugged our parents. The moment was very heartwarming. The Tunes began introductions with the parents, despite that everyone knew who they were anyways. Each of the girls also took the chance to introduce their new boyfriends to their families, and vice versa. As our parents went over with Aunt Jackie to talk to Mr. Folles and Elise's parents, Hale looked on over to Elise. I took note and nudged him gently on the arm. \"You gonna just stand there? Go to her, you idiot!\" He gave me a playfully dirty look before sauntering over to her, chatting happily away to their hearts content. I looked around, seeing everyone in their own conversations and groups. Then I felt a large pair of red arms embrace me from behind and a deep voice rumble in my ear, \"Didn't know you can dance too. Maybe you can dance with me, sometime.\" I flushed a deep shade of red before gently elbowing him in the chest. \"Nawt! Behave! I'm starting to think this 'less restrictions' thing is getting to your head.\" He chuckled merrily. \"I'm joking, sweetheart. You know, I would like to dance like that too. You and Hale got some serious moves there!\" I laughed. \"Well, maybe later we can ask Nada for some more lessons. I'm sure she wouldn't mind.\" He grinned a cheshire grin then turned me over while keeping me in his embrace. He pulled me in tight, leaning his head down, his lips a few centimeters from mine. \"Sounds like a plan to me.\" I leaned in as we dove into a passionate kiss. After a good minute or so, we pulled apart, grinning from ear to ear. We both looked over as the rest of our friends and family called on over to us to join them for a nice afternoon barbeque and something about a pool party to boot. I turned back to him and smiled brightly. \"Come on, babe. We got half a day for party time left and we can't let it all dwindle past us.\" He grinned mischievously. \"Well, we could .\" I laughed and punched him lightly on the shoulder. \"Later, tiger. Later... \", I whispered to him with a mischievous grin of my own. His eyes widened in surprise, then smiled with a playfully wicked grin and whispered back, \" It's a promise then .\" ","Summary":" I did say I would make a sequel, and here it is!
