[{"Movie":"It's a Wonderful Life","Title":"It's Still a Wonderful Life","Author":"tsstewart","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13155523","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Buffalo Girl The cool wind bristled through the budding trees. Soft sobs from a mourning crowd muffled the birds chorus'- seasonal promises of new beginnings. Nearly everyone in Bedford falls was there, but that was expected. The Bailey's had always given everyone so much the whole town felt as if they had lost a piece of themselves. And although they all felt loss, none felt is as deeply as George Bailey. Always ready to provide help, offer a solution, solve a problem, but this time, was different. This was something that couldn't be fixed. It was something that couldn't be changed. It was something that had to be accepted. One by one, his neighbours, friends and family gave their condolences, leaving George to his thoughts. Though he tried, he couldn't get his feet to move from their place. Knowing, as soon as he did, he had to live the rest of his days in his new reality- one without his beloved Mary. A hand clasping his back started sobs flowing uncontrollably, his children's embraces stopped him from collapsing. Only once before had he felt such anguish - many years ago on Christmas Eve, gripping the rail of the bridge contemplating his life. \"Mary.\" Whispering mournfully. What will we do without her?\" Looking at his two beautiful daughters, who resembled Mary so greatly in appearance and mannerism, reminding George of earlier days of life. Toting kids on their hips, while doing as much as they could in the businesses and community, smiles on their faces all the while. Hugging his dad again, Pete said, \"You know she's in a better place, and no longer in pain.\" \"I know Pete, I know.\" Wiping his tears. Tommy reached into his pocket and handed his dad an envelope. Looking at his father, he noticed a strange concoction of age and youth. Creased lines and grey hair, a slowing body, but his eyes - holding the love of his youth, they sustained him in time. He hoped to have that look one day. \"You know mom, she always did have the answers.\" Said Zuzu. Laughing softly, contemplating the impact and love of the woman they laid to rest. \"We're going to be at the boarding house Pops, when you're ready. I know people want to give you their respects.\" He said quietly. \"I'll come now..\" George began to say, \"When you're ready, Daddy, no one is rushing you. Uncle Marty has taken care of everything.\" Said Jeanie This is a time you should actually think about yourself.\" Pete gave his dad one more hug and George watched the four of them walking away, grateful they all remained friends in their adult years . Walking over to a bench he opened the envelope. Tickets fell out. Train tickets, plane tickets and ship tickets, and a letter, His eyes filling with tears, clutching the letter to his chest, the one last bit of Mary left behind. His fresh tears smeared the ink on the parchment, joining Mary's dried ones. My Dearest George, These last days I was able to remain on this earth, with you and our children and our grandbabies. I am so, so grateful for. I heard you talking to Zuzu, on one of my bad days, wishing away my pain. Don't you ever doubt that my last days weren't worth it. Rest assured, my darling, that the joy, and the peace during those days was so much greater than any pain. I was collecting all the moments, all of the words all of the silence of my loved ones. You spent your whole life sacrificing for others. My dreams came true through you, now I want your dreams to come true. Do you want to know what the best sound in the world is? Anchor chains, plane motors & train whistles Go George. Go and see the world that you have waited so patiently to see. Go and see the buildings and the sky scrapers and bridges. Be inspired. Eat your coconut! Go shoot the works! A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels - the oldest champagne - the richest caviar - the hottest music. And the prettiest wife, well she'll be watching you from a far, but, if you listen closely you'll hear her in your heart. I want you to breath in the air from all around the world. I want you to walk the beaches of the coasts. I want you to go to a place you have never thought of going, and all the ones you did. Don't leave one rock unturned. Its all in order. I have purchased the tickets to get you on your way. Its' your turn, now George. I only wish you didn't have to wait so long. But know, that in your waiting you have done so much good. You have made the world a better place. And that sure is something. I am so happy that I was able to spend my life at your side. I told you that I'd love you until the day I die. Go now, see the world, live your dreams. Clarence and I will be watching. Until we meet again, Your Buffalo Girl George read Mary's letter over and over. He very much so wanted to stay in this moment so he didn't have to move on, but there were two more stops he wanted to make before he headed to the reception so, reluctantly George headed on his way. Standing over the first grave stone, he smiled, \"Well Mr. Gower, You've probably already heard, but I think that old suitcase might actually get used. I really do think I won a million dollars, it was camouflaged as Mary Hatch. Take care of her for me, will ya.\" A few minutes later he came to two more stones. \"Ma, Pop.\" He brought his fist to his mouth, closing his eyes trying to control the tears. \"Thank you. I don't know if I told you enough - what you've given me. Thank you for that old Building and Loan. Thank you for cooping me up in that shabby little office. It was there that I learned to live. You had a talent, pop, a wisdom, that I could never have learned in college or travelling. Never. And ma - well you always knew me better than myself- if it weren't for you, I'd never have gone to see Mary that night. And well…she really was someone that had answers, she really was.\" \"Thank you Mr. Gower.\" George said, brushing his thumb over his engraved name, clicking his suitcase shut. Buffalo Girl playing softly in the background, George sat down on the bed. The old picture of him lassoing the moon in catching his eye, \"If only I was still so full of confidence that I thought I could lasso the moon.\" The horn of a taxi rose from the street. \"Well, I better get going. You'll be coming with me, right Mary?\" George, headed down the stairs, wiggling the top knob on the banister with a smile. The phone started ringing, pausing, an old familiar feeling came over him. \"George let's not stop, let's go.\" The sound of Mary's youthful, vibrant voice filled his memory, \"OK, Mary, we'll go. This time, we'll go.\" with a deep breath he opened the door - the ringing phone disappearing behind him. My Big Brother George \"Hey, George!\" Ernie said opening the trunk. \"Where am I taking you today?\" \"To the train station\" Ernie grab his suitcase putting it in the back of the taxi. \"The train station, where are you off to?\" \"I'm going to start at New York, and then from there, well, who knows.\" \"Shooting the works? Who would have thought! You're finally going. Good for you!\" Ernie said, \"It was Mary.\" George said. \"She put it together with the kids before she passed.\" \"Mary.\" Ernie smiled, climbing into the cab. \"What a girl she was. You're a lucky man George, to have a wife like that.\" \"I know, Ern, I know.\" George said, \"Bedford falls will miss you. But its in good hands George, that boy you have. He is quite something.\" \"Yah, Pete has the heart of his grandfather and the passion of his mother.\" George laughed. \"I practically had to drag him off to college to get him out of here.\" \"And it did him and Bedford falls a load of good. He has ensured the maintenance of all the old buildings, and brought in the new businesses. Whoever donated that money would be proud. I sure am to call Bedford Falls home. \"There aren't many like it left, that's for sure.\" George nodded. The tourists love it, and boy does you Janie ever have the touch with them. She's like the mother hen of tourists, just scoops them up in that old Ma Bailey Boarding house and treats them like her own.\" beep beep \"Hey Bert! Guess where I'm going?\" Ernie hung out the window. Bert pulled up next to Ernie \"Taking George to the train station - he's finally going!\" \"What do you say!\" Getting out of his car, Bert gave George a hearty handshake. \"Good for you Georgie - Good for you! You'll have to get some more posters to put on the wall of that old house of yours! Hey! We should go for a send off drink- do you have time? Martini would love to send you off.\" \"I suppose we could go for a quick one.\" George agreed. \"Well, look what the cat drug in!\" The bells on the door rang, \"To what do I owe such an unexpected pleasure?\" \"We're here to celebrate!\" Said Ernie, \"George is going see the world! Just like he always planned to do Mary arranged everything for him to go traveling.\" \"You don't say! What a girl! A round on the house then!\" Martini brought over four drinks, the old bar filled with laughter of memories decades old. \"What a night that was. I'll never forget it - when Mr. Welch punched you right in the kisser.\" Martini said, shaking his head. Nodding slowly, George took a drink,\" Unsure where the conversation was going, people seldom brought up that night. \"That was something.\" Said Martini, \"But you know what was always more impressive to me? Was how you never lost that…that…that joy, that happiness that filled your house that night. How did you keep it? How did you hold onto it? Even after all these years?\" Martini asked. \"An old friend once said to me, \"Each man's life touches so many other lives.\" I began believing that, living it. Whenever I began to feel the way I felt that night - when the hopelessness, the discontentment, the discouragement crept in, I would think of that old friend, and who I would be leaving. And then I thought, about what my father used to say, \"All you can take with you is that which you've given away.\" - and I would think about all the people who's life I could touch to make them better. True contentment can only come from serving others from giving yourself a away. It wasn't always easy, sometimes I had to fight for it. I became a warrior. A warrior for contentment, and then every once in a while, happiness would visit, and sometimes sadness, but always contentment.\" \"To contentment\" Martini raised his glass. \"To Contentment\" the three echoed - clinking their glasses, easing into a comfortable, contemplative silence.. \"And how's Harry? Did he stay long after the funeral?\" Asked Bert, breaking the silence. \"He's good, doing well. Wife and kids are good.\" \"And the business?\" Earnie said cautiously. \"It's holding on.\" George nodded. \"Definitely has some problems right now, which is of course stressful on the family, but, he'll hold on.\" The three exchanged looks. \"What?\" \"We saw him at the funeral, something's not right.\" Said Bert. \"Well, I did try to call him to tell him I was leaving, but, I couldn't get a hold of him.\" Said George. \"Well even if something is wrong, he's strong, he'll….\" \"He isn't you George.\" Martini added. \"He doesn't have the grit, the perseverance to make it through.\" Said Ernie. \"Doesn't have the grit?\" Said George, \"What do you mean doesn't have the grit? Why he's a decorated war hero, and an education football star!\" \"He's nothing with you!\" Said Bert. \"Now, that's just not true,\" objected George. \"Look, he, he, got married without us..\" \"Yah, I've always wondered that. Why would he have gotten married without you or his Ma with him? Why didn't he introduce you first? And then knowing he wasn't going to come back to the Building and Loan, and not say anything?\" Bert put his hands up, \"Look, thats not to say its any of our business, but what I am saying is that something was off.\" \"He himself, you were the richest man alive, on that night. So he recognized it too. When you get in a pinch call George- he knows!\" Said Ernie. Still not convinced, Martini said, \"He almost died, you saved him!\" \"You paid for his school, with money that you worked hard to earn.\" Said Bert. \"Where he met his wife, and got his job.\" Said Ernie, \"Why, your cousin Tilly, told me when he called you when he won the award, he even reversed the phone charges!\" Added Bert. \"Well, whats wrong with all of that?\" Asked George. \"Nothing, nothing at all, but what all that says, what Harry's life ultimately says is, \"I need my big brother.\" Said Martini. George thought back to the unanswered ringing phone. \"Can I use your phone?\" \"Sure, sure George go right ahead.\" \"Hello, Harry? Harry its George. \"I'm ok, yes, everything is fine. I just wanted to tell you that Mary she's….George paused. Bert, Ernie and Martini watched as that old familiar look came across George's face - compassion, empathy, sympathy, and they waited. George took a deep breath, closing his fist against the wall, resting his head on it.\"….I'm really sorry to hear that Harry. Really sorry.\" George paused again. \"I wish…I wish there was something I could do. I , But, Mary, she put together a trip for me, before she died, and I think I should…I need to go. I'm leaving today. I wish I could stay to help you, but I promise I'll call you along the way. How long? I'm not sure, a few months, at least. But the kids, they will be looking after the house, so if you need a place to stay for a while, just call one of them….OK, I love you Harry, and I'll be thinking about you. You take care now. It will all work out. I'll talk to you soon.\" A breath of relief rippled over the table. \"Well, best get going then.\" George said shaking hands and clasping backs with his old friends. TRAIN WHISTLES The train whistle filled the air. A strange sensation puffed through George- he was the traveller today. The one leaving, the one going on an adventure. \"Hey Georgie Porgie\" A familiar voice coming to his ears. \"Hello Violet.\" George said, exchanging a hug. \"Where are you off to today \" brushing off his suit jacket. \"I'm going on a trip. Mary, she put it together for me, before she passed, so - I'm leaving today. A warm smile crossed Violet's face. \"Good for you George. No send off party though?\" Violet asked. \"No…I…figured…\" \"I understand.\" Violet smiled, nodding \"Mary a heart of gold that girl. Tenacious and smart too. You made a good choice in her.\" \"Yes, she really was. She really was. How's your gang doing?\" \"They're great, never thought I would settle down, but when you and Sam brought in all that new work - well - there was bound to be someone who could domestic me. As much as I could be domesticated anyways! \"How's business?\" George asked \"Oh, its booming. Doing really great. I'm just picking up another order for the store, all the way from Paris.\" Pointing to a train cart where her boxes were being unloaded into a truck. \"No one could bring better style into this one horse town, that's for sure.\" Smiled George. Violet looked at him, \"Hey, wait a minute would you George?\" Slipping over to the cart, she ruffled through a few boxes, and handed George a new suit, hat, shoes and belt. \"Oh, I couldn't Violet,\" George shook his head, handing the attire back. \"I wont take no for an answer!\" Violet said. \"Why, if it weren't for you,\" her eyes filling with tears. \"Well, we don't need to talk about who I'd be without you. Now you take this, and go on some nice fancy dinners, and smooze with the best of them will ya?\" She winked, kissing him on the cheek. \"Thank you, Violet.\" George said. \"ALL ABOARD!\" The conductor called. \"You better get going,\" Exchanging one more hug. Violet watched as George got in line for the train, \"Hey, George, \" she called, \"thank you, for always believing in me.\" Watching the Bedford falls sign disappearing from his view, George sat bewildered with unidentifiable feelings. It was indescribable finally doing something he had dreamt about for so long. \"Excuse me! EXCUSE ME!\" \"Pardon me? Sorry, thats my bad ear.\" George looked up to a plump lady, dressed in black fur, with a scowl of impatience across her face. I said, you're in my seat. \"Oh! Well! Sorry about that!\" George got up and shuffled to the seat across where he was sitting. \"What happened?\" \"What's that?\" George said. \"To your ear?\" \"Oh, my brother fell into a pond, when we were…\" \"Disgusting isn't it?\" The lady interrupted, completely ignoring George. \"All those factories clogging up the landscape.\" Looking at the smoke stacks pass by, warmth, instead of disgust filled him. \"Those factories, do clog up the open landscape, yes,\" George agreed. \"See, I'm so glad you agree with me.\" The lady began. \"But\" George held his hands up slowing her, \"If you look past the ugliness, they also give people a purpose, a home, food on the table. And a world filled with people without a purpose, well I'd take that over ugly any day.\" \"Pish-posh! The only people who say things like that, are the ones making money - so you must have made lots of money off of them. \"Well, a bit, to be honest. I live a few towns back, and my friend - Sam Wainwright, he started a plastics company in an old abandoned factory- but it brought a lot of work to the town. He came, and then another, and another. We were able to build new businesses, and people moved into town. The schools got better, the shopping. It was really swell. Especially for the people who had worked to get ahead for so long.\" \"Swell,\" she raised her eyebrows at him. \"and I suppose that you were a participant then, in building all of those things?\" \"Well, yes,\" George said. \"My entire family actually. I always had a passion for building things, and it was quite a blessing to have the new opportunities come to me, and my children - they just had such talent in business, economics, relating to people, I have never had prouder moments than watching my children do what they were meant to do.\" \"And were you involved in the startup of these companies? Or did you gather that from the hardworking townsfolk, promising them greatness, only to have them work there?\" George smiled at the miserable old thing, wondering what had happened to her that made her so pessimistic and miserable. \"No, we actually received a large sum of money donated in trust to the company my father started, the Building and Loan, indeed for the use to prosper our town. From there, we started a community advisory committee, and we put that money to good use. We restored and maintained the town, and brought in new jobs. Many people who were living on tight budgets, were able to raise their standard of living. And then that went back into the economy, and so on.\" \"Well, isn't that nice that you live in the perfect little town where perfect things happen. \"Now, I never said that,\" said George, as politely as he could to the brisk woman, \"We have a town full of hardworking people who take pride in every avenue of their lives. And that's created a sense of value, a sense of worth, a purpose. A home. Which, for us has come from some of those factories. She raised her eye at him. \"Well, to be born in such a place, must have been wonderful. Not everyone is so fortunate. To have parents like you leaving a successful business, and being part of a community like that\" \"Well, yes, you're right, not everyone is fortunate enough to grow up in a town like Bedford Falls. We can agree on that.\" \"No, they're not.\" In that moment, George had a flicker of understanding what that feeling was when he left. Homesickness? Impossible! He laughed to himself, \"for Bedford Falls? Already? What do you think of that, Mary?\" \"What was that? The lady said \"Nothing.\" Said George, returning to his window so he could appreciate his view. Airplane Motors Get out of my way - doesn't anyone have respect for the elderly anymore?\" Quickly closing his over head carriage George took his seat. \"Could you imagine- having to deal with the likes of him?\" Grumbled a middle aged man next to him. \"I can, actually.\" George smiling as the young woman and man who were trying their best to fix the old mans problem. \"Worst thing is, there ain't no changing someone as old as him.\" The man said. Watching the commotion, George's memory drifted in time. \"George! George! Come see! Its pandemonium across the street! Coming through his office, George joined his Uncle Billy and cousin Tilly at the window. Afresh with the new year, new promises and new hopes. Thanks to Mary, his friends and family had come and saved him from grave trouble replacing the money that Uncle Billy lost, he had a new outlook on life. \"Why- what are they doing over there at Old Man Potter's?\" George asked. \"They're arresting him! They're arresting him!\" Yelled cousin Tilly bursting through the front doors. Turning back to the window, they watched a half dozen police, pushing Potter's wheel chair out of the bank while trying to control the boisterous, loud crowd. When the police shut the car door, applause broke out up and down the street. \"Why it's a Christmas Miracle! A Christmas Miracle!\" Uncle Billy cried, \"Life's finally caught up to him!\" \"What could he have done?\" Asked George. \"Who cares! Uncle Billy danced! He's gone! He's outta here! We need to celebrate! We need to Celebrate!\" He said, running back to his office. \"Where are you going?\" Uncle billy held a bottle of scotch and two glasses in his hands. \"I'm going to see what has happened.\" Said George grabbing his hat and coat. \"Bah! Leave the old bugger! You know he's had it coming.\" Ignoring him, George ran out of the Building and Loan, across the road \"Did you hear?\" \"What a scandal! All that money in the world, and he's arrested for stealing!\" \"Why, I bet he's been stealing all along!\" \"Did you see George did you see? Old Man Potter has been taken away - stealing money! He did!\" \"Money?\" George said confused. \"What money?\" \"Who cares! He's gone, he's gone.\" Pushing through the crowd George entered into Potters office. \"What's happened?\" George demanded. \"He stole the money George, the eight thousand dollars- your eight thousand dollars. The tellers, they put it together. That your money went missing and then all of the sudden he deposited that same amount. Can you imagine? Making such a careless mistake after all these years? Why, its almost as if he WANTED to get caught!\" \"I don't….I don't understand.\" Running his hand through his hair. \"Your Uncle Billy- he put the money in the paper and then handed the paper to Potter, and Potter had me roll him into the office- I thought something was up, but I never put it together. It's quite something.\" Said Potter's assistant. \"So what are they going to do?\" Asked George. \"Why do you care? You said so yourself he's a warped frustrated old man.\" \"It's not right, wheeling off an old man like that- humiliating him like that. He may be a criminal yes, rude, mean, cold hearted- but, but he's still a human. And that's gotta count for something.\" \"What are they going to do to him?\" George thought aloud. Admiring him in the moonlight, Mary reached over and stroked his head, \"Mr. Potter stole your money, almost drove you to end your life and here you are worried about him while the whole town's out celebrating.\" \"Its just, I know it doesn't make any sense, and justice should be done, but, what good will it be if he just comes out worse. He's a miserable old man, with a sick demented old soul - his deals have been shady, maybe, maybe he is getting what he deserves. Its just, how do we help someone who's greatest enemy is themselves?\" \"I don't know the answers to those questions, George. But, I know someone who does.\" \"What are you doing here? Coming to gloat are you?\" Mr Potter sat staring out a loan window in a cold cement walled room. \"No, Mr Potter. I'm not.\" \"Well you read the papers didn't you? Hot off the press- Potter Convicted Felon. I suppose the whole towns celebrating! What will they say about you now? Coming around the likes of me?\" \"I don't care what they say, Mr. Potter. I just wanted to make sure you're ok.\" \"That I'm ok?\" Mr. Potter spat. \"Why? What's it to you?\" \"What's it to me? You're a human being aren't you? Good, bad or indifferent? And every human being should have someone to make sure they're ok.\" \"I've lived most of my life without someone around me, I'm not going to start now! You've got your money back and then some now justice was served. I'm locked up, no longer competition. You should be happy! Not coming around here to bothering me! Now leave me alone!\" George nodded and turned to walk away. \"I just figured since it was my money that you stole, that you would tell me what happen? I didn't ask during the trial because, well, I thought you were humiliated enough.\" \"You worry about your feelings and I'll worry about mine!\" Yelled Mr. Potter. \"I don't need you coming in here, or out there, or anywhere for that matter, trying to compensate for me! I refuse to become a miserable little clerk crawling around on my hands and knees for help. I have enough money to get the best lawyers - you wait and see, I will be set free- and those tellers who called me in - they will pay!\" George stopped in the doorway. \"Ok, Mr. Potter. Ok. I didn't come in here looking for a fight, just an explanation, and then I thought maybe…\" \"Maybe what? And apology?\" \"No,\" George shook his head, \"I don't need an apology either, I just thought perhaps you'd like a friend. I can't imagine what it would be like to be up here all alone.\" Mr. Potter didn't reply. \"Back again, are you?\" \"Mr. Potter, the nurses say you're not eating, not talking.\" \"What do you care? Just means I'll be leaving this earth all the sooner.\" Mr. Potter grunted at George. \"What did they call you for anyway?\" \"Because I'm the only one who has ever come to see you\" Mr. Potter only grunted in response. \"I heard, some more of your businesses were sold.\" George said sitting in a chair. \"To you're pleasure I'm sure.\" Spat Mr. Potter. \"No, its not. I can't imagine what it must be like to watch what you worked so hard for dismantle itself one by one.\" \"You wouldn't know anything about it.\" Snapped Mr. Potter. \"Why you and your father and that run down Building and Loan wouldn't know the first thing about,…about..\"Mr. Potter started coughing, George went over and pat his back and got him a glass of water. \"Why do you keep coming back here?\" Mr. Potter asked. \"Just leave me to my last days and get on with things.\" \"I wish I could do that, Mr. Potter. I truly wish I could, its just, it ails me, somewhere deep inside to know that your off in some room rotting away like a forgotten criminal.\" \"Thats what I am!\" Harped Mr. Potter. \"You may have been convicted of a crime, and a criminal at that, but you're not forgotten. Not by me, anyway.\" Mr. Potter turned his head staring out the window. Standing silently in the doorway, George sensed a sudden urge to ask one more question.\"Mr. Potter- what was your childhood like?\" Mr Potter gave George a look like he had never seen before in his lifetime. The genuine kindness of George's words demolished a lifetime of walls that Mr. Potter built around himself. In a moment, five words bound up a lifetime of pain and melted away icicles on an old miserable heart. \"Why would you ask that?\" His voice a softer more broken. \"I just realized I've known you almost my entire life but don't know much anything about you.\" Mr. Potter looked at him surrendering to Georges sincerity \"You know, if you had ask me that question a few weeks ago, I would have had a very different answer for you. But I've been sitting here thinking, and if you tell one single soul outside of this room what I'm about to tell you-\" \"I wont Mr. Potter, I wont, don't worry. I wouldn't want to ruin your reputation.\" Promised George. \"If you had asked me that a few days ago, I would have given you the same story as every other adult brazened by their childhood. A child repeatedly disappointed by their parents, other adults and life in general. A boy, with no friends, left to fight their way through the world. A boy without a \"someone\" as you put it. But, that would give me little responsibility for the man who sits here before you. So I'll spare you all of that. Your father let me on his board of directors because he thought it would soften our relationship - and therefor the business between us. But, all it did was anger me somewhere deep inside and worsen my hatred for him. Because the truth is that my envy of Peter Bailey turned to covetousness. But what Peter Bailey had, you couldn't buy with money. And so I did everything I could to double cross him, to stay ahead of him and everyone for that matter at all costs. The first years weren't what childhood should be - no - but everyone has woes, sorrows, strife, complaints and needless bruises. But pain is not what separates us, or defines us. Its what we do with the pain that defines us. Because- here's the truth George, your father's life had woes, and sorrows, and all that as well - everyone's dose. But the difference between your father and I was that I chose to keep all those pains of the past in front of me, and they blurred my perspective of the world around me. Your father, however, chose to put all of the pains of the past behind him, and they made him stronger. Don't feel sorry for me George Bailey, I am getting what I deserve - what I wanted most of my life - alone, here in seclusion. Alone in my thoughts. The day I was arrested, as humiliating as it was, I was so relieved- finally, -finally I was beaten, they put me away and I wasn't able to hurt anyone anymore. \"But Mr. Potter, to not eat, and your arthritis is..\" \"Is the physical result of what I have allowed my life to become. Debilitating. Debilitating arthritis because of a debilitating soul. \"Maybe you are getting what you think deserve, but do you want to know what I think? I think is everyone deserves a second chance, especially those who are willing to change.\" \"Well what are you saying then George?\" Ma Bailey said clearing up the dishes. \"I'm not saying anything, only that Potter- even amidst his downfalls, he's still a person.\" \"He's getting worse, I hear.\" Said Annie. \"Yes, every time one of his businesses are sold, he falls a little more into despair. I'm not sure how long he will make it like this. Stuck in that cold, damp place, alone - with nothing to occupy his mind. Nothing too…\" \"He can come here then.\" Mrs. Bailey said. \"What?\" Mary, George and Annie said in unison. \"That's what you were hoping for wasn't it?\" Mrs. Bailey's hands on her hips. \"You don't think I know how you think? A mother always knows.\" \"He can pay room and board and that will help us out.\" Annie chimed in. \"Are you sure?\" George asked exchanging a look with Mary. \"He can't do any harm to us- he's too old, and he isn't going to live that much longer, \" Mrs. Bailey shrugged, \"We have an obligation to take care of the elderly, even if it is Henry F. Potter needing the care. If you can get it in order George, Annie and I will do the rest.\" \"But I do want a pay raise!\" Annie laughed. \"George, I'm happy you're here.\" George pulled a chair along side Mr. Potters bed. \"How are you doing today? Mr. Potter.\" \"Oh, the same as every other day - dying.\" He laughed. \"It will make many people happy to see my name on a head stone.\" Mr. Potter was in no better health, but since moving to the Bailey's Boarding house, something had changed. \"Now, Mr. Potter, you shouldn't say such things.\" \"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Most people don't like me George. I don't like them either- but I also.\" Potter stopped. \"For a very long time, I also didn't like myself very much. These last few months with your family's kindness, has helped me with that. Reach in that drawer George. There's an envelope addressed to you.\" George pulled it out, and started to read through the papers- \"Its your will,\" He flipped through the pages reading them, \"Mr. Potter, you can't, its too much, its..\" \"Its all I have.\" Potter nodded. \"Mr. Potter, I couldn't…\" \"You can, and you will.\" \"I already got the money from before - that's been enough…\" \"Yes, and what did you do with it! You set up college funds for your kids and let Mary do the house up, bought a new vehicle. All good things, but this money? Use it for yourself. Use it to build things like you always wanted to do, use it to travel places you've always wanted to go.\" \"But there's so much Bedford Falls could …\" \"You've given Bedford falls enough!\" Potter exclaimed. \"But, since I knew that you'd say that,\" - handing George another envelop. \"I've made an alternative one, with a large portion of my estates going into the care of the Building and Loan to be used for whatever your board sees fit - as long as it enhances Bedford Falls. Which wont be a problem with the Bailey's in charge. Even if that is letting the rabble move out of my slums.\" Mr. Potter smiled. \"Mr. Potter I don't feel comfortable…\" \"All you can take with you is that which you've given away. I used to see that sign when I went into that old Building and Loan, never fully understanding it. Writing your father off for such foolery. But, I think I understand it now.\" Now, you hush up and fulfill a dying man's request. All the times you went out of your way for this town - and this! This is what you're going to fight me on? The money for your mother and Annie is well deserved, they took very good care of me. \"And there's, there's one more thing I need to tell you.\" Mr. Potter took a deep breath. \"Its not something I'm proud of, in fact, it may be the lowest thing I have ever done.\" \"Ok, Mr. Potter.\" George put the papers down as Mr. Potters expression changed. \"I was there George.\" \"Where?\" George leaned forward, grabbing Mr. Potter's hand to steady him. \"That night. When everyone brought you money, because…I…. \"Mr. Potter began coughing. \"It's ok,\" Mr. Potter. You need to rest.\" Moving his hand to the side, \"I need to tell you. I came there, to your house. And I couldn't go in. I sat there with the money in the envelope, counting your hundred dollar bills as you sang and celebrated friendship and love - things that were so foreign and unknown to me, and I just couldn't go in. I couldn't go in there, where so many good people were. Where so much happiness was. I was undeserving. I was tired of ruining things George. And even though I had the solution in my hand, I would have ruined something so much more meaningful, more wonderful if I had gone in. In the lowest moment of your life, there was so much more happiness than the highest moment of mine. How's that for pathetic? So as I sat there, I reasoned the problem was solved, people had brought you money, Sam Wainwright had even forwarded up to twenty-thousand dollars. You and the town of Bedford Falls and you were better off, to be left with the realization that you truly were the richest man in Bedford falls. I had already sold myself out so many times, what was another eight thousand dollars?\" \"Mr. Potter…\" George began but there were no words to describe the gratefulness he felt for having the privilege to witness a man once filled with such tyrannical animosity being reconciled into a man filled with humbled benevolence. Mr. Potter held his hand up, hushing George, swallowing coarsely. \"When you came to me that night, I had your missing money, the money that could have sent you to your death in my desk. I'm so sorry George. I know, it doesn't mean much, but…that night, I told you, that you were worth more dead than alive. But the truth is, its me who is worth more dead than alive. \"Now, that's not true, Mr. Potter. You shouldn't say such things.\" Said Mary, leaning on the doorframe, tears flowing from her eyes. When she had arrived, George didn't know. Mary moved over to Mr. Potters beside, \"I'm so glad we've had the chance to get to know you better.\" \"At least now my money will go to good use. Maybe that was the plan all along?\" His breath ailing, looking at Mary.\"For my heart to be closed so that all my money was kept stored up until now. Maybe, there's a reason? Maybe something is coming along and all my greed and pride and cruelty can be used for good. I like to think that way, is it wrong for me to think that way?\" \"No, Mr. Potter.\" Mary's eyes glistened with tears. \"I think you're right.\" \"George, I want you to know that, that you're worth more, than all I have ever been. You're in every person in this town. Your in the walls and floors and roofs of their homes. You're in their businesses. You're in their pasts their presents and their futures. There is no money that can compare George.\" Mr. Potter smirked, \"Did you get that Annie?\" \"I didn't hear nothing. Just coming on in here to check your sheets, and you go on giving me such a hard time.\" Annie ruffled his bedsheets turned to leave, \"Stay.\" Said Mr. Potter. Annie stopped at the door, turned around patted Mr. Potter's hand pulling up a chair. \"I should have rot away, thats what I deserved. But you - Mary, Mrs. Bailey, and Annie, you all saved me. For that George, I can't thank you enough. Thank you for teaching me to live George. Thank you for giving me life. Stay with me, a while longer will you? \"Of course, Mr. Potter, of course we will.\" George whispered. Mrs. Bailey joined them a little while later. And for the first time in his life, Henry F. Potter was surrounded by the warmth comfort of friends.\" \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please take your seats and fasten your seatbelts as we prepare for liftoff. The announcer brought George back to reality. Looking at the old man still grumbling, and then back at the man sitting next to him, \"You never know, its never too late for people to change.\" Anchor Chains George walked to the front of the ship. How different he felt the last time he looked over a rail into water, life, just like water can bring calmness and calamity, \"Last stretch before home, Mary. You know, the irony of this whole journey is that I spent so much of my life wanting to get away from Bedford falls. To get out of that town and see the world. And when I finally did - I spent all of my time talking about it, and if I'm being honest, wanting to go back. I have met so many people on this journey; people searching for themselves, people sure of themselves, people somewhere in the middle lost in a bay of despondence, missing some fundamental link that it seems is just so automatic in a small town like Bedford falls. My father said that he figured we filled a fundamental urge at the building and loan, and when I think back on these past few months, I don't think that I was doing much different than what I do at the Building and Loan. Along with fulfilling my lifelong dream of travelling, I was still helping people, I coaching people, I even loaned them money. I think that I've helped people to see those fundamental needs that they are missing - the ones my father spent his whole life helping people achieve - a roof over their head, walls around their loved ones and a fireplace to keep them warm, better put, a home. Mary, there are so many people in this world who are missing a home. A real home, not just the building, but a place filled with the love, and safety and consistency and surety. They're missing what you so naturally gave me and our children and what they can now give our children because of your sacrifices. And so, what I think I've discovered, is that its not that places that fill your life up -, even though this world is truly beautiful, but really, what makes life beautiful, worth living, are the people, and knowing that amidst this world, there is a place you can call home. I could travel the world and if I didn't have a home with people in it to love, I would have nothing. And I could have never traveled past that Bedford falls sign, but because I have a home with people to love, I really do have everything. And if what my friend Clarences said was right - that no man is a failure who has friends, then I think in addition to that, there is no greater measure of a man than his home- even if their passports are filled. How's that for a philosopher? Huh Mary? You wont believe it, but I think I'm ready to go home. I'm ever so homesick for Bedford falls. Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink There goes the anchor. What an amazing sound, I'm so glad I got to hear it on this side of the world, but Mary, I'm just not so sure that its the best sound in the world anymore. The sweet smell smoke puffing up the chimney filled Georges senses as the soft crunch of a Christmas eves snow fell blanketing him in comfort. The song of Christmas carols filling his ears. Walking up the path of the old inn, stopping to look at the window, Mary threw a wishing rock at all those years ago when it sat in desolated anticipation. He didn't know that his life would turn out like it did when he walked a young eighteen year old girl home from a high school dance. But he was ever so grateful it had gone the way it did. \"Grandpa George! Grandpa George\" Little Mary came running down the stairs leaping into his arms. \"I missed you!\" \"Dad! You're back so soon!\" Janie, a mirror image of her mother came into the entrance. \"Merry Christmas!\" \"I couldn't miss Christmas Eve with you all - you're mother wouldn't have liked it! You did the house up…\" \"Just like mom would have.\" Said Janie hugging him. \"We couldn't go the first Christmas without this old place decorated, your wife wouldn't have liked it!\" \"Come on in the living room tell us all about your trip.\" Said Zuzu. Looking around his living room, he suddenly didn't want to talk about the buildings he saw, the people he met or the places he went, so sitting on the sofa, with his grandkids gathered around him he said, \"Do you kids want to know the three best sounds in the world are?\" \"We know dad, we know,\" said Tommy \"Train whistles, airplane engine and anchor chains.\" The room said in unison. George smiled, \"Those are good sounds, but I think I have found better ones- the patter of children's feet, the laughter of loved ones, and well, for me - the town bells began to ringing- \"Grandpa George- listen, listen! The bells! Do you hear the bells?\" \"I do, little Mary, I do.\" Smiled George. \"Those bells, those bells are the best sound in the world, because they mean, I'm home.\" \"To home!\" Pete raised his glass. \"To home,\" The room echoed. \"Grandpa George,\" Little Mary said, taking Georges face in her tiny hands. \"Teacher says, every time a bell rings, an angel gets her wings. Do you believe that? Grandpa George? Or do you think its hogwash?\" \"I believe it, my little Mary,\" George said scooping her up in his arms. \"I really do. Looking up he winked \"Good job, Mary, good job. Merry Christmas.\" ","Summary":" Buffalo Girl The cool wind bristled through the budding trees.

That feeling that the world is out of joint. It's like everything tips sideways for a moment, though she is still standing on the thin carpet of the floor, hand raised toward the shelf. Such sensations aren't uncommon, though people seldom talk about them, except with their eyes. Some say it's the War, which turned so many things upside down, and left parents unable to recognize their sons or sons their parents. Then, it's Christmas Eve; she supposes any spinster facing the holidays alone might think she had slipped between the cracks of normal life. And then there is the atmosphere of Pottersville itself. The town's whirl of lights and noise dazzles like a carnival; sometimes you don't know what's real and what's a mere false front, behind which muddy fields strewn with garbage stretch away into the dark. The library is one of the town's few quiet places. That's one reason Mary works here, rather than in a hustling office or glitzy department store. Blinds filter the lights of the street, among which Christmas decorations are almost lost in the flash-flash-flash of the casinos. The rule of silence, which lies deeper than changes in government, hushes the noise from clubs and bars. Ranks of books, reaching backward into the past and forward to the future, remind her that all troubles thought unendurable are eventually defeated by time. Most of the books whose titles face her are strictly practical. The funds allotted to the library stress that their purpose is to create doers, not dreamers. Manuals on bookkeeping, homemaking, and growing vegetables on windowsills line the shelves alongside Samuel Smiles and Horatio Alger. Poetry and fiction, save for robust tales of success and self-reliance, are in disfavor; the town council's directives hint strongly that anything else is a waste of its budget. Yet not even Mr Potter can dismiss the classics. In their dull library covers there stand, straight-spined, Mark Twain and Henry David Thoreau, Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens. Authors who, like a cantankerous old grandfather, have earned through sheer venerability the right to criticize men like Mr Potter, but whose judgment can safely be ignored as a relic of another time and place. Without emphasis that might raise questions, Mary recommends these books to children and teachers who come to her desk for advice. She talks about their classic status, the prizes they've won, their moral tone as commonly understood. She doesn't mention what to her is their major virtue: that, artistic beauty aside, they offer a vision of the world that is rooted in kindness rather than competition. Children in Pottersville come in two varieties. Some are too loud and aggressive for their size. The others say too little; they keep their eyes down and shrink away from the space taken up by the loud ones. Those children, she thinks, need adventures in which worldly success is not the only miracle. 'Miss Hatch?' comes a little voice. Mary shakes herself and slides the book she's holding into its place. Standing just inside the door is a boy of about eight, twisting a snowy cap between his hands. 'Hello there. How can I help you?' She doesn't know the boy, but that means nothing. Pottersville is growing fast. Often most faces in the street are those of strangers. 'Am I too late for the Christmas reading program, miss?' Mary embraces any child who signs up for her reading programs. 'Not at all. You've got - '. She looks at the clock, which says ten minutes to four; ten minutes till closing time. 'Twenty minutes left. I'll fix you a sign-up sheet and you can choose the books you want to read over the vacation.' She takes the details of the boy, whose name is Michael, and gives him a record sheet printed on both sides and a packet of gold stars. Clutching his sheet, Michael disappears into the children's section. Mary tidies her desk, straightening the stapler and gathering stray paper clips. There's nothing to do now but lock up and go home to her lodgings. In the silence of the library, she's aware that she's waiting for something. Not just for Michael to return with his books, though she's eager to see what he's chosen. It's Christmas Eve. Even in this hollow corner of it, something of the world holds its breath. Michael reappears. He carries a book about baseball and another in drab bindings whose title she can't make out. 'I'd like these, miss,' he says, dropping the books on the desk. 'I dunno what others to get. Haven't heard of most of 'em.' 'Maybe I can help with that. I've picked out some books children might like, especially this time of year.' She leads him to a table where books are propped upright beneath a swag of paper chains. Screened by an extra-large Robinson Crusoe is a hoard of treasures. She pulls out the one she's after: A Christmas Carol , in an edition designed for children with nice big print. 'Have you read this? The story takes place on Christmas Eve, but long ago in another country. It's about a very rich, unpleasant man who's visited by ghosts.' The boy reaches for the book, his tongue sticking out as he looks at the pictures. 'Marley was dead,' he tries from the first page, and nods as if it meets his requirements. 'I think my gran told me about this book once. Something about an old man and ghosts, anyway. She said the old fellow' – here he lowers his voice to a whisper, as if in dread of recording angels – 'was like Mr Potter.' Even more vigilant of angels, Mary doesn't reply in words. She leans forward, making a tunnel between her eyes and the boy's, and drops her glasses long enough to wink. She stamps the books. Michael goes out, holding them under his coat against the snow. Alone, Mary looks around the orderly library and picks up her bag. Thinking of the evening and the day to follow, she swallows a sigh and squares her shoulders. Christmas alone isn't so bad. There will be friends to visit, books to read. She's reaching for the doorknob when she stops, her attention caught by something at the corner of her eye. On the returns trolley, which she's sure had been emptied, leans a single book. She picks it up. It's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , one of the books she most often recommends to children. This, however, isn't the library's copy. It's too old, antique, and there's no card pocket inside its cover. Did the boy bring it in? He didn't look like the sort to own anything so valuable. Was it a Christmas gift? She knows no one who would give her such a thing. She puts the book in a drawer, promising to discover its owner after the holiday. The clock reads just after four, and even in the library, early dark is creeping through the shades. As she opens the door, a swirl of flakes blows in. Late shoppers hurry home, heads bent against the wind. Laughter spills from the bars. Along the street comes the sound of a disturbance, shouting and running feet. Nothing unusual in Pottersville, yet for some reason she finds herself straining to hear. The details are blunted into vagueness by wind and snow. Stepping over the threshold, once more she's overtaken by that sense that the world is somehow slantwise. For a moment the familiar door almost wavers in front of her eyes. This time, though, the feeling has a different cast. It reminds her of childhood Christmases, when the season's alchemy revealed the potential for joy and wonder beneath the surface of the everyday world. Surroundings transformed by a curtain of snow. The feeling of time tilting on an axis, the birth of new hope at the dark ebb of the year. As the sound of sirens fades into the winter night, Mary Hatch locks the library for the last time.

Nobody seemed to remember Mr. Potter who remained unpunished for his selfish deeds. The old crab spent the Holiday alone, aside from his loyal assistant who stayed by his side to push his throne-like wheelchair. He was now even richer than he was before thanks to the $8,000 which he found and kept. However, the money didn't make up for the fact that Mr. Potter's health was slowly deteriorating. That New Year's Eve, he came down with a bad cough. His assistant helped him into bed and called the doctor. Potter's breathing got worse by the minute. The doctor got there as soon as he could but there wasn't much he could do. Potter's lungs were infected and inflamed. He had pneumonia. Now on his deathbed, Mr. Potter thought about all the terrible things he had done during his lifetime. He had been greedy, selfish, miserly, stubborn, crabby, and cruel. He had committed many sins throughout his life and he took pride in each one. Living life as a villain certainly made him unpopular, but it was worth it. He was going to die friendless, but it didn't matter. He had gotten all the enjoyment he wanted out of life, simply by being a mean old buzzard that lived for his money. He did have one regret though…the wish that he could have done more to torment the likes of George Bailey and his kind. The lights in his room were turned down low. His vision was darkening fast. He could barely stop coughing long enough to breathe. His chest was rising and falling with great pain. He shivered with chills despite his blankets. He was alone now, his doctor and assistant having left him to rest. They knew he would likely not survive to see the New Year. Perhaps he would have more to do in the afterlife. Potter closed his eyes and released his final labored breath. Potter opened his eyes. He stared up at the ceiling for a moment. All of a sudden, he felt wide awake. He then sat up in bed, startled by now easy it was to do. He pushed away his blanket and reached for his wheelchair. But then he got a sudden surge of energy. He didn't want to sit in his wheelchair anymore, he wanted to stand up. So he threw his legs off the bed and put his feet on the cold floor. He wobbled a little but soon managed to stand all by himself. He then took a few steps across the floor, quivering with excitement and confusion. How was this possible? He hadn't taken a step in years. His legs had previously been damaged by Polio, yet he was now walking. He didn't even feel sick anymore. It was like a miracle. Then it dawned on him. Potter froze and glanced around the room. There was a candle flickering on the nightstand. He walked over to the candle and slowly put his index finger over the flame. He felt no heat so he brought his finger closer until he was touching the flame. His fingertip was now engulfed in the burning flame, yet he felt no pain whatsoever. His assumption had been correct. He was a ghost. Mr. Potter stared for a long moment at his flaming fingertip. He grinned ear to ear as he thought about what this meant. The possibilities were endless. He now had more freedom than ever before in his life. His mind raced, trying to decide what he should do first. The decision was so difficult. Finally, he decided to pay a visit to George Bailey. x X x Mary went upstairs to check on the children – they were all sleeping like angels. They wanted to stay awake until midnight, bless their little hearts. Especially Zuzu, who wanted to be with her daddy rather than go to sleep. Mary smiled fondly at the sleeping children, before going back downstairs to join George and Uncle Billy who were in the kitchen having coffee. \"What time is it?\" asked George. \"Still two hours and ten minutes until midnight,\" Mary said, taking a look at his almost empty coffee cup. \"Do you want some more coffee?\" \"Why do people stay awake all night on New Year's Eve anyway?\" George wondered, aloud. \"What does it accomplish?\" \"It makes you really tired on New Year's Day,\" Mary replied, jokingly. \"Do you want some more coffee?\" George nodded, clearing his throat. \"You know, I've a got a good mind to go straight to bed.\" \"You can't do that, George. You'll disappoint the children,\" Uncle Billy said, sipping his coffee. \"How will that disappoint the children?\" asked George. Mary poured some more coffee into George's cup and put it back on the table. \"They're counting on you to stay up,\" she said. \"Little Zuzu wants to know exactly what a New Year looks like.\" George picked up his cup and took a small sip. \"What does she expect me to see?\" Mary shrugged. \"I don't know but she's certain something's going to happen.\" Suddenly, George felt a slight breeze against the back of his neck. He thought it was strange since there were no doors or windows open. He chose to ignore it and continued drinking his coffee. \"Did you see that spider web in your cupboard?\" asked Uncle Billy. \"What spider web?\" asked Mary, eyes widening slightly. \"There's a spider web your cupboard,\" he repeated simply. \"I've got lots of spiders at my place. I've got them all sizes.\" Mary opened her mouth to respond but suddenly felt a tap on the back of her head. She whirled around to see who it was, only to find nobody behind her. \"What's wrong, dear?\" George asked. \"I...I thought felt someone touch me,\" she replied, looking around the kitchen. Uncle Billy glanced warily at George, who stood up and patted his wife on the shoulder. \"We're both a little tired,\" he said, stifling a yawn. \"I'm positive I felt something,\" Mary insisted. \"Do you want to go to bed?\" \"No, I'll be alright.\" George went back to sit down, but quickly turned his head when he saw something move out of the corner of his eye – something like a dark shadow. \"Hey, is somebody playing tricks around here?\" George asked, narrowing his eyes as he looked around the room. \"Don't look at me,\" Uncle Billy said, as he grabbed a napkin. Just as he started to use the napkin, it slipped out of his hand and fell under the table. \"Oh, excuse me,\" he said, reaching down to pick it up. But when he tried to retrieve the napkin, it slid away from him – almost as if someone had yanked it out of his reach. Puzzled at this, Uncle Billy got on all fours and reached for the napkin again. This time, the napkin jumped away and flew across the floor, almost as if by magic. Uncle Billy became more earnest, trying to grab the offending napkin by pouncing like a wildcat. Still, it continued to escape his grasp. He ended up chasing the napkin all over the kitchen floor, much to the shock of George and Mary. Suddenly, a deep dark chuckle echoed through the house. \"Hello, George Bailey…Can you see me? I can see you… George spun around in disbelief, searching for the source of the taunting voice. \"Who are you?!\" he shouted into space. \" Georgie Porgie, Pudding and Pie…Kissed the boys and made them cry…\" \"SHOW YOURSELF!\" An icy wind blew through the kitchen, causing the frightened threesome to hug themselves and shiver. Then another evil cackle rang through the house. The dishes began to rattle and shake. The lights began to flicker and flash. The dark silhouette of a man appeared in the window for a second, and then disappeared. Mary clung to George, who looked around for a weapon. Uncle Billy was completely shaken up as well. He stayed close to George too. \" Oh, Georgie Boy…Why didn't you come to my bedside when I was sick?\" \"Who are you?\" Mary called. Suddenly, a dark mist began to form overhead. Inside the black cloud appeared the face of someone dreaded. Someone baldheaded and mean-looking. He glowered down at his three former enemies. \"Mr. Potter?\" \"In the flesh,\" he chuckled. \"Well, sort of…\" \"What…What happened to you?\" asked Mary. \"Oh, I've been a little under the weather,\" Potter replied. \"You look pale,\" Uncle Billy remarked. \"Makes sense,\" Potter said, smirking. \"I died at my home just a few minutes ago.\" George locked eyes with Mr. Potter as he slowly approached the looming intruder. \"You're a ghost then?\" \"Don't you believe in ghosts, Mr. Bailey?\" \"I believe in angels.\" Potter laughed. \"Well, ghosts aren't quite the same thing I'm afraid!\" \"C-Can you hurt us?\" asked Uncle Billy, nervously. \"My children are asleep upstairs! You wouldn't harm a child, would you?\" Mary inquired, shivering. Potter laughed again. \"No, I don't believe I could even if I wanted to. But I am here to have myself some amusement!\" George frowned, training his eyes on the ghostly figure. \"How do you plan to that, Mr. Potter?\" \"Allow me a moment to humanize myself and I'll show you…just how real a ghost can be.\" And with that, Potter transformed himself from a head in the mist to a full-size man. He was now the exact same Mr. Potter that everyone knew and hated – except he was standing on two feet. George took a step forward and clenched his fists. \"Tsk, tsk!\" Mr. Potter scolded him teasingly. \"Don't even bother. I'm a ghost, remember?\" \"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Uncle Billy. \"I don't know yet, but for starters…\" Potter raised his arms and at once, a legion of stray ropes were produced out of thin air. The ropes attacked George, Mary, and Uncle Billy – lashing them each to a separate chair. Potter waved his arm and the knots were tightened, binding the trio's hands behind their backs and their ankles to the chair legs. \"Let us go this instant!\" Mary demanded. \"We haven't done anything wrong!\" Uncle Billy cried. \"Whatever trick you've got up your sleeve, tell us what it is, or I'll rip the answers out of you myself!\" George threatened. Mr. Potter grinned evilly and rubbed his hands together. \"Let's see now…How shall I have my fun with you three?\" Nobody noticed the big spider that had crawled out of the cupboard and was now scurrying across the floor, towards Potter's hostages. \"I can't hurt any of you,\" Potter went on, strolling back and forth in front of the three chairs. \"That would be physically impossible for me, considering I am a ghost. But there must be another way…Any suggestions, folks?\" \"Go take a flying leap into some tar,\" George growled. The spider ran over to Uncle Billy's right leg, and crawled into his pants. \"Is there any way we can talk you out of this, Mr. Potter?\" asked Mary, hopefully. Potter laughed and shook his head. George leaned closer to Mary and whispered, \"Dear, whatever he does to us, try not to make a lot of noise. We don't want the children coming down here and finding themselves in this predicament too.\" Mary nodded. \"Right.\" \"Stop talking!\" barked Potter, as he tried to figure out what kind of torture he would inflict on his helpless hostages. Suddenly, Uncle Billy began squirming and giggling uncontrollably. Everybody looked at him. \"What's so funny?!\" Potter shouted at him. \"Heeheeheehee! Th-There's something on my leg! Heehehehehee! It tickles!\" he squealed. George rolled his eyes. As if this situation wasn't embarrassing enough already. Mr. Potter raised an eyebrow. \"Oh…you're ticklish, eh?\" \"G-Get it off! Heeheehahahahaha! Please, but don't hurt it!\" Potter knelt down and shoved his hand up Uncle Billy's pants leg, reaching around for the spider. Uncle Billy writhed and laughed even more hysterically. Potter's hand was tickling his calf and knee. \"There, got it,\" said Potter, as he withdrew his hand and held the spider in his palm. Normally, Potter would have crushed the spider right then and there, but being a ghost made that impossible. He put the spider on the floor and let it crawl away. Uncle Billy took a minute to catch his breath and calm down. Potter grinned evilly, now he knew exactly what he was going to do. Then, as if on cue, he noticed a long black feather on the floor beside Uncle Billy's chair. \"Hey, where did this come from?\" asked Potter, holding up the long feather. \"Oh, that belongs to my raven,\" Uncle Billy said. \"He sheds feathers sometimes.\" \"Is that so? Well, remind me to thank him,\" Potter chuckled, as he came forward and quickly removed Uncle Billy's shoes and socks. \"What are you doing?\" asked Uncle Billy, trembling as his bare feet were propped up on the table and his toes were tied back with string. Mr. Potter said nothing but simply took his position. He began tickling Uncle Billy's feet with the feather. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STOP! PLEASE STOP! HEEEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEHEEEEHEHEHEEE! DON'T TICKLE ME!\" Uncle Billy pleaded through his laughter. Mr. Potter was stroking the feather slowly up and down his bare soles. This experience reminded Uncle Billy of when his nephew George was a little boy. Sometimes the playful youngster tickled his uncle's feet to make him laugh. Uncle Billy remembered how torturous it used to be when little George would to sneak into his room and tickle his feet when he was in bed. Poor Uncle Billy was even forced to keep shoes on constantly during the day so George wouldn't tickle him. Those years were long behind them though, since George was an adult now and seldom took interest in messing with his uncle. But now Uncle Billy was reliving those memories and it was even worse this time, because now he was completely restrained and helpless. \"Coochie coochie coochie coo!\" Potter chuckled, as he let the feather glide along the unlucky man's heels and insteps. Potter's evil eyes gleamed with sadistic pleasure. He brushed the feather against the balls of his feet, before going back to tickle his insteps again. Uncle Billy threw his head back and bucked wildly in his seat. He laughed and squealed and shrieked. Tears fell from his eyes. His feet wriggled around as they desperately looked for some relief. But there was no escaping the tickle torture. He couldn't even curl up his toes because of the string that restrained them. \"OOOOOOOHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! PLEASE NOT THERE! HEEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEEE! NOT THE TOES! NOT THE TOHOHOHOHOES!\" he screamed, as Potter drove the feather back and forth between his toes. The feather also found the vulnerable undersides of his toes and gently caressed this deathly ticklish spot. This continued for fifteen minutes before George took pity on his uncle. \"Hey, hey, why don't you go pick on somebody else?\" he seethed. At this, Potter stopped tickling Uncle Billy and turned to George. \"Have you got something to say, Mr. Bailey?\" \"I said leave him alone!\" George barked. Potter chuckled, twirling the feather around between his fingers. \"But I'm just beginning. I haven't had this much fun in years!\" \"Untie us! Now!\" Potter shook his head. \"No, I think it's time for you to have a turn.\" \"Me?\" asked George. \"Certainly,\" Mr. Potter replied. \"Aren't you ticklish as well?\" \"Of course not!\" George said, quickly. Potter raised an eyebrow, as he took position at George's feet. He removed the younger man's shoes and socks. \"What do you think you're doing?!\" George demanded. Potter didn't answer, but simply grabbed the feather and drew it up and down George's soles. \"Stop it,\" George hissed through clenched teeth. He was holding his breath. Potter continued to attack, occasionally glancing up and observing how well George was holding out. He assumed George would be a hard nut to crack, but he wasn't ready to give up anytime soon. \"You might as well laugh, Mr. Bailey. I'm not stopping until you do…In fact, I may never stop at all. You may not be as ticklish as your uncle but you can't hold out forever,\" Mr. Potter gloated, as he swirled the feather in fast circles on George's heels. This caused George to show visible strain on his face. He bit down on his lip as the first beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Still, Mr. Potter pressed on. He was very patient, running the feather lightly into George's insteps. The younger man's face turned bright red and he began to shake. Finally, he couldn't control himself any longer. He had to giggle just a bit. \"Hehehehahahaha! Stohohohop!\" But this only spurred Potter on and made him more determined to drive George into hysterics. Potter then dragged the feather across the pads of his toes, up and down his insteps, and in torturous circles on the balls of his feet. George finally let loose and laughed up a storm. \"BAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! TH-THIS IS A DISASTER! HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHOHO! A CATASTROPHE! P-POTTER, YOU'VE GONE MAD! HAAAAHAAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!\" \"Georgie Porgie, Pudding and Pie…Got tickled mercilessly until he cried,\" Potter sang, as he danced the tip of the feather along his toes. For the next ten minutes, Potter exploited every nerve in George's helpless feet. He feathered the heels, arches, and balls of the feet. A wicked grin was plastered across the old ghost's face. He had finally broken the mighty George Bailey, the great man whom he had caused so much trouble for in the past. As if that wasn't enough, Potter wanted to cause him yet more suffering – and was doing a good job at it. \"YOU OLD COOT! AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAHAHAA! LEAVE MY FEET ALONE!\" George yelled. \"I refuse to stop until you shed some tears!\" Potter declared, hungrily. \"I must have tears!\" \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA DAMN YOU!\" It took half an hour but sure enough, George eventually had tears running down his cheeks despite promising that it would never happen. Then Mr. Potter stopped, giving him a badly needed rest. George gasped for air as he slumped forward in his seat, almost exhausted. Mr. Potter continued to grin wickedly as he strolled over to Mary and touched her cheek. \"I see you've been patiently awaiting your turn, my pretty.\" \"St-Stay away from her,\" George ordered, panting. \"Don't do this,\" Mary pleaded with Potter. Potter pouted his lip in mock sympathy. He then reached downward and removed her shoes. Mary kept her nerve and continued to lock eyes with him. Potter grabbed the feather and held it in front of her face. \"Mr. Feather here says I can do whatever I like,\" he said, coldly. Mary glared at him. \"You are a cruel being, Mr. Potter.\" \"Thank you but flattery will get you nowhere,\" he said with a smile. Then he propped up her bare feet and got to work on her pretty soles. Mary managed to hold back her giggles for a few seconds, but it didn't take long for her to crack. \"EeeeeeeheheheheHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEEEE! MR. POTTER, STOP THAT! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" \"Stop you say? So sorry, Madame. But I can go on like this for hours,\" Potter quipped, gliding the feather up and down her arches and under her toes. Mary laughed even harder and fought violently in her bonds. She absolutely hated being tickled. \"Hey, stop!\" George shouted, becoming defensive although he was in an equally helpless position. Potter ignored him and kept on tickling. He let the feather brush the balls of her feet, before traveling down to her arches and heels. He made sure each part of her soles got equal attention. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOOOOOO! NO MORE! EEEEEHEEHEEHEEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE! I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE!\" Mary howled, as she bucked and writhed in her seat. This went on for about ten minutes before Potter gave her a break. \"Well, that was quite enjoyable,\" he mused. \"Now what should I next?\" \"No more tickling!\" Mary begged. \"We can't stand another second of this inhuman torture!\" George added. Mr. Potter laughed an evil laugh. He looked at his three victims and shook his head in pity. \"You really think this is over? We're just getting started, my friends!\" \"What are we going to do, George?\" whispered Mary. \"He's a ghost. He'll have to cross over eventually,\" George said. \"But when?\" she asked. Potter walked back over to Uncle Billy and began tickling his feet again. This time, Potter used his fingers. He scribbled his fingers all over the man's tender bare soles. Uncle Billy burst into hysterical laughter. \"AAAAAAAAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! NOT AGAIN! NOOOOOO! SOMEBODY HELP ME! HEEEHEEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEHEE! PLEASE! IT TICKLES TOO MUCH!\" Potter then went over to George's feet again and tickled them for a while. George tried not to laugh but he was weakened from the last session. He couldn't hold back any longer than a few seconds. \"GAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH! OOOOHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH QUIT TICKLING!\" Then Potter went back to Mary and tickled her beautiful feet again. She squealed and burst out laughing. \"EEEHEEHEHEHEHHEHEHEEEHEHEE! NO STOP! STOOOOP! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO MOOOORE!\" Potter went back and forth, taking turns tickling each one of them. The ticklish trio laughed like lunatics. They wondered if the torture was ever going to end. Perhaps Mr. Potter planned to tickle them to death. He was a cruel enough man to do something like that. George prayed that God would send an angel to rescue them. Sure enough, there were benevolent beings keeping watchful eyes on the victims. They decided that Potter's spirit had caused enough trouble. It was time for the old coot to say goodbye to the world. Little did he know, however, that his minutes were limited. His hourglass was running down without him even knowing it. He thought he had all the time in the world to torment George Bailey and his family, but he would soon cross over. His bastard spirit would be going home very soon. His new home was to be a place full of wailing and gnashing of teeth. The End ","Summary":" Christmas Day came and everybody was happy.

As he was putting on his coat, there was a knock on the door. It was the secretary. \"Sir, Mr. Potter's lawyer is outside and he says that it is imperative that he talks with you.\" George sighed, took his jacket back off and nodded his consent to have him come in. He sat back down in his chair. \"Good evening, Mr. Bailey. How are you this evening?\" asked the lawyer nicely. \"I am well. And yourself? What can I do for you?\" George asked. Many different scenarios went through his head on what he wanted. It had been a week since Mr. Potter had passed away. \"Mr. Bailey, I am sure that you are eager to get home to your wife and children so I will make this short. Mr. Potter has put you in his will and wished to give me a letter that he wrote himself to go along with the things that he has bequeathed you.\" Out of his briefcase, the lawyer pulled out two pieces of paper. He handed the first to George; the second, he read out loud. \"I bequeath George Bailey $8,000, for reasons that George will find out in the letter that I have directed to be delivered to him. Second, since I have no heirs, I bequeath George Bailey all of my shares and property, including the bank.\" George's jaw dropped. He could not believe what he was hearing. Why would the warped, old man give him all this. Potter wanted nothing more than to tear George down in the past, and now he gives him the bank in his name and $8,000. \"Thank you very much, is there anything else?\" George asked. \"No. I will have to get the deeds to the house and the bank. I will be back tomorrow morning with them and we can officially sign these over in your name.\" \"Yes, thank you,\" George said, in a little bit of stupor. He was gobsmacked at this turn of events. He walked the lawyer out of the building, shook his hand and thanked him and turned back inside the Old Building and Loan. Shutting the door to his office, George sat down and grabbed the letter that Old Potter had wrote and instructed to give to him. The letter read: George Bailey, When you read this letter, that means that I have passed. Before I pass though, I would like to clear my conscience. Five years ago, when your Uncle Billy lost the $8,000, the old fool had put it in the paper that he was showing everybody in the bank about your brother getting the Medal of Honor. He had put the paper down and I had taken it to my office in the bank and found the $8,000 in it and kept it from you and everybody. I was so driven to shut you down. The Old Building and Loan had always been a thorn in my side. It would have worked too if it had not been for the people's love for you and sending you that money to save you and the Building and Loan. So on my deathbed, I would like to say that I am sorry and that I underestimated you. I had always respected you in some way to be able to handle going against me and how kind you were to the people. I could have learned a lot from you but as you pointed out, I am a warped, old man. I am giving the money back to you. I don't expect you to accept my apology. Good luck in your future endeavors. My only request is that with this money, you finally get out of this crummy old town and take your wife on a honeymoon that she really deserves. Good luck Mr. Bailey. Mr. H Potter George still could not wrap his mind around what he was reading. He just sat there, trying to make sense of the words that he was reading. His thoughts were interuptted from the shrill noise from the telephone. He answered. \"Old Building and Loans, this is George Bailey. How can I help you?\" \"You could start by coming home for dinner tonight,\" the teasing voice of his wife carried through the receiver. George chuckled. \"Dinner will be ready in about twenty minutes, so you have ten to get home.\" \"I will be there soon Mary. I promise.\" \"Is everything okay?\" Mary asked, hearing the strain in her husband's voice. \"I'll explain everything when I get home when the kids are all in bed.\" \"Alright. I will see you soon then. I love you.\" \"I love you too, Mary.\" George hung up the phone, put his jacket back on, put the letter in his pocket, shut off the lights and the door and locked up for the night. I guess it was right that his whole family was going to be there tonight, so he could tell them the change of events and their fortune. When he entered the house, he was ambushed by his two youngest children, Zuzu and Clarence. He laughed joyously and gave them kisses. He embraced his other children and nieces and nephews. After getting free from the children, he walked over to Mary and embraced her in a loving embrace. \"How was work?\" \"It was definitely interesting,\" George answered. \"What happened?\" Harry asked, embracing his brother. \"I had a meeting with Mr. Potter's lawyer, discussing his will,\" George replied, pouring a drink into his glass and taking a swig. \"That old coot left you something?\" At this George gave a hearty laugh. \"What did he leave?\" \"I will tell you all what he left me after dinner,\" George promised. They had a nice meal of pork chops and potatoes. When they were done eating, the children all helped clean up after supper and the grown ups went into the living room. Mary handed her husband a drink. He looked like he needed it. He smiled his thanks to her. When they were all seated in the living room, he pulled out the note in his pocket and read it out loud. When he finished, they were all silent for a moment or two. They could not believe this either. Nobody really knew how to respond. \"He kept that money?\" Uncle Billy finally had the courage to speak. \"I am so sorry for being so harsh on you that day,\" George apologized. \"It's not your fault,\" Billy answered, accepting the apology. \"Well, what are you going to do with it all?\" \"For one, we could afford the kids to go to college,\" George answered. He turned to Mary. \"Mary, how would you like for me to finally take you on the honeymoon that you always wanted?\" \"We can take care of your children,\" volunteed Harry's wife. Mary felt overwhelmed with everything and just smiled. \"That sounds wonderful. Are you sure that you would be willing to take care of the children?\" \"Of course. There's nothing to it,\" Harry promised his sister-in-law and brother. \"That settles it then, we shall go on a honeymoon of the lifetime. Where shall we go?\" \"Everywhere,\" Mary responded. George was hoping that she would say that and kissed her. He was truly excited. He felt bad that he could not give his wife the honeymoon that she deserved and now he could. \"Why don't we plan on leaving in a month so then that would give us enough time to plan and enough time for all of the deeds to be settled. But could we do one thing?\" \"Of course, what is it?\" \"I don't want to leave this house. Let's just stay here and not buy a new house or move into Mr. Potter's house.\" \"I agree. This is our house and forever will be. With the money, we can finally afford all the repairs that need to be done.\" A month came and went like it was no time at all. Mary and George were all packed and ready to go on their honeymoon. They decided that they would renew their vows and make it seem like they really were going on a honeymoon. The train was pulling up to the station when everybody were saying their goodbyes. \"Be good for your Uncle Harry and Uncle Billy. We'll call as often as we can and bring back souveniers from all of the places that we visit,\" George promised. As they boarded the train, George turned to Mary and said, \"This was the best thing that Old Man Potter did. Helping me take you on the best honeymoon ever, the honeymoon that you deserved.\" He gave her a passionate kiss. ","Summary":" It was late afternoon and George Bailey was ready to go home and have a warm supper with his wife, "},{"Movie":"It's a Wonderful Life","Title":"Trapped In Pottersville","Author":"SuperBear","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518836","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Come on, Zuzu. We're off to do our early Christmas Eve walk.\" Ever since George Bailey had what he called his Great Miracle, he approached each day with a sense of joy. As part of that, he instituted a new tradition: an evening walk each night with his daughter Zuzu. He even did it on Christmas Eve. This was now the second Christmas Eve they went for a walk. As Zuzu talked excitedly, the two passed the familiar sights of Bedford Falls: the movie theater, the savings and loan, even the office of notorious town miser Mr. Potter. So reviled was Potter that some even joked he was in league with the devil. George got so caught up in hearing about Zuzu's life—the teacher who was nice, the boy she liked, the girl at school who smelled funny—that at first he didn't notice the unusual clamor around him. But then he saw it: a mob of revelers, rowdy ones, on Christmas Eve, filling the streets of Bedford Falls. Except this wasn't Bedford Falls anymore. George looked around and saw the town had changed.. Zuzu let out a kind of gasping noise. \"Daddy, what is this?\" \"A very bad place,\" her father replied. \"This is the place I told you about.\" Looking mystified and nervous, George took in the strange sights around him. While Zuzu looked on, George mumbled to himself. \"How can this be? How can I be back here in this place?\" George didn't need to see the flashing \"Pottersville\" sign to know where he was. He could tell by the types of businesses that lined the street: the Dime-A-Dance, the pawn shop, the bars and clubs up and down each block. He was back in the world where he was never born. It was during his Great Miracle which came right after his Great Crisis. (George often capitalized the names of things; it was part of his dramatic flair for things..) When $8,000 went missing from the savings and loan, George contemplated throwing himself off a bridge. Before he could, someone else fell in. Or, as he learned later, jumped in. Once he performed the obligatory rescue, George met an unusual little fellow named Clarence Oddbody who claimed to be his guardian angel. \"You look about like the kind of angel I'd get,\" George remarked cynically at the time. Not taking the claim very seriously, George idly wished he had never been born. Soon he was introduced to a place where the corrupting influence of Mr. Potter was seen in the businesses and the people. In that sad place, George's friends were broken people with broken lives. Even Bert the cop wasn't afraid to fire his weapon with civilians around. And all because someone was simply acting a little strange. Once George begged God for his life back, he was soon back in Bedford Falls where he was approached by a kind friendly helpful Bert. George then ran through the streets shouting \"Merry Christmas\" to anyone he met. He even felt joyful about going to jail, as long as his friends and family were all right. That change of attitude would have been miracle enough. But there was one more miracle that night. The people of the town stepped forward to give whatever money they had, to repay George for their homes, for the bailout during the Depression, for all George had done for them. It was repayment for George's friendship and the wonderful influence he had on their lives. . As each person gave what he had, it was enough to turn back this one instance of misfortune. Although it turned out it was actually, in part, an act of evil. Zuzu had heard the story many times, of course, and she had learned a lot from it. Now as she looked around at this strange new place, the story became very real for her. \"I don't like it here,\" she said. \"I don't blame you, honey,\" George said. \"Please, God, get us out of here,\" he muttered. \"I'm afraid that won't work, George,\" someone said. Out of the darkness stepped Henry F. Potter. \"You see, just as you got help from the man upstairs, I made a deal with the other fellow.\" As he continued to move forward, Potter wore a menacing smile. \"You've been brought back here to this place. But this time you won't be going back.\" After George's Great Miracle, the people of the town learned Mr. Potter had the missing $8,000. George's Uncle Billy, a partner at his nephew's savings and loan, remembered that he put an envelope with the $8,000 inside a newspaper, which he then absent-mindedly handed to Potter. How did Uncle Billy happen to recall this? It turns out that in times of stress, like when George angrily interrogated him, Uncle Billy had a tough time remembering things. But during a pleasant event, such as the one where people were giving George money and singing songs, it was easy for him to remember things. Once Uncle Billy revealed Potter had the missing money, some of the townspeople wanted to form a mob with torches and pitchforks. George talked them out of that. They did, however, go to Potter's office to confront the man. With an earnest oh-so-innocent look, Mr. Potter claimed all he had done was accept a newspaper from Uncle Billy. He had no idea there was money inside. He never even looked. Luckily, the money was still around to be returned. \"Here's the money back,\" Potter said before the angry mob. \"No harm done,\" he said with a nervous smile. \"And I'm very sorry about that whole business of threatening to have you arrested, George. If only I'd known about the money sooner!\" Like most people in Bedford Falls, George was not fooled by Mr. Potter's play-acting. But legally there was nothing that could be done. As a result, Mr. Potter did not go to jail. Now that mean old miser stood in the center of Pottersville. With half his face in shadow, Potter smirked as he stepped forward. \"You stay here, George,\" Potter said. \"I'll go back to Bedford Falls and see if I can finally take it over.\" A shocked George shook his head. \"This can't be, Mister Potter. You would never sink this low.\" Briefly, George considered. \"No, wait. Of course you would.\" \"You bet I would, George,\" Potter laughed. \"Here you are, and here you'll stay. Have a nice long stay, won't you, George?\" As the man laughed, he faded away. \"Now what do we do?\" George asked. \"I suppose I could do what I did last time.\" He looked up and cried out. \"Help me, Clarence! Help me, God! Get me back!\" \"Not working,\" George muttered. \"But then I don't really have the same desperation as last time. So now what?\" \"We pray, Daddy,\" Zuzu said. As he clung to his daughter's hand, George looked worried and frightened. \"I'm sorry, honey. Praying isn't working. At least not here, now.\" Zuzu blinked her eyes. \"Isn't that what you did on your big night that you talk about?\" \"Why, yes, Zuzu. But something is different this time.\" \"What's different?\" \"I'm not sure.\" George suddenly felt very cold and wrapped his arms around his coat. \"Button up your coat, Zuzu. All the way.\" She did so. \"I'm going to pray,\" she announced simply. \"You do that. I'll try to think of a way out of this mess.\" \"Maybe the praying just needs more time to work.\" As George frantically looked around, Zuzu silently talked to God. When she did, she didn't fold her hands or close her eyes. She'd been taught she could talk to God any time anywhere, whether or not she did either of those things. \"I'll get out of this,\" George murmured. \"I got out before, I'll do it again.\" \"George,\" someone said. George whirled. This time it was a friendly familiar face. \"Clarence!\" George exclaimed. He clutched the ragged coat of the odd-looking fellow. \"You're back! It's good to see you again! And thank you. You know. For what you showed me that night.\" \"You're welcome, George,\" Clarence said with a slight chuckle. As he looked his friend over, George frowned. \"But you look the same. Maybe worse, with that ragged coat. You don't even have wings!\" The bulbous-nosed man in the tattered coat and dirty fedora gave George a wry smile. \"That's just how you see me now, George. You'll see me as I really am once you have more faith.\" Zuzu smiled. \"Even though he doesn't have wings, I can tell he's an angel. He's so nice!\" \"Thank you, Zuzu,\" Clarence said quietly as he leaned over. Standing upright again, he clutched George's arms. \"Forgive my manners, George. Hello! Good to see you! And nice to meet Zuzu, too!\" \"Nice to meet you,\" Zuzu said with a slight curtsy. \"Well, I'm glad you're so happy, Clarence.\" Again, George frowned. \"What brings you here? I mean, I know you're an angel. But what brings you here, now?\" \"It's because I prayed, Daddy.\" Clarence gave her a pat on the head. \"Zuzu is right, George. On your crucial night, or what you call your Big Miracle, people prayed. That's how I was able to come to you.\" \"Well, however you're here, I'm just glad you're here,\" George said with a laugh. \"Use your powers. Get us out of here.\" Clarence gave him a look. \"That's not up to me, George. I don't have the power. You do.\" Now George looked confused. \"What do you mean by all that?\" He gestured to the town around him. \"Aren't you the one who did all this before?\" With a slight grin, Clarence shook his head. \"My superiors did that, George.\" He nodded to the stars above then to the surrounding buildings. \"When you wished you were not born, they brought you to this place. When you cried out, they returned you home.\" Tilting his head, Clarence gave George a knowing look. \"And by faith, you will return home again.\" \"By faith?\" George sputtered. \"Clarence, I don't have time for faith. I need to get back. Zuzu can't be out in the cold like this.\" He waved to the mob of revelers. \"And this is not a good place for her. For anyone!\" Again, Clarence nodded. \"You're certainly right there, George. But now listen to me: When Jesus walked the earth, he could only do miracles when people had faith. In his home town of Nazareth, he could do no miracles there because of their unbelief, their lack of faith.\" George tried not to make his snort too derisive. \"Well, I don't know about Jesus walking around the earth, Clarence. I don't watch movies of Him like you angels in heaven apparently do.\" Here, George waved his left hand dismissively. \"Oh, Daddy,\" Zuzu said with a giggle. \"That's not how it works, George,\" Clarence said with a slight sigh. \"Oh, pardon me. Maybe up in heaven you have one of those new-fangled televisions.\" With a slight roll of his eyes, Clarence crossed his arms. \"In heaven, we see into the past. We watch the real thing.\" \"Well, I don't!\" Zuzu tugged on her father's coat. \"It's okay it you can't see into the past, Daddy. You can read about Jesus.\" \"Yes, George. It's in your Bible,\" Clarence said pointedly. He counted on his fingers. \"Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Take your pick.\" \"We have a Bible,\" Zuzu volunteered cheerfully. . \"Yes, I'll dust it off later,\" George murmured. \"First, how do we get out of here?\" \"Now just take it easy, George. I'm getting to that.\" Clarence held up a finger. \"When Jesus was unable to do miracles, it wasn't because He lacked power. It was because people would not step forward in faith to ask for the miracles.\" George made a face. \"You know, Clarence, I think I'd prefer talk about Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn to this Sunday school lesson.\" With another wry grin, Clarence tilted his head. \"I'm an angel, George. Are you telling me I can't read Mark Twain and teach a Sunday school lesson?\" \"Angels can do a lot of things,\" Zuzu said brightly. \"Yes, I suppose they can.\" As George sighed, he also shivered. \"What am I supposed to do, Clarence?\" \"Step out in faith, George.\" The incredulous tone returned. \"Step out in faith? I've already done that. I asked for help getting back.\" \"This time you must do something a little different. You must give hope to your friends in Pottersville.\" At first, George merely gaped then he waved his hand at his surroundings. \"But this place isn't even real!\" he sputtered. \"Oh, Daddy, of course it's real.\" As he smiled, Clarence gave Zuzu another pat. \"Zuzu is right again, George. You see, whenever a person makes a decision, there is another world where the other decision plays out.\" The odd-looking angel spread his hands. \"You see the proof of that.\" Zuzu tugged on her father's hand. \"Let's try to help the people here, Daddy.\" \"I'd like to,\" George said quietly. \"I just don't see how.\" Zuzu smiled up at him. \"But you've always been good at helping me and teaching me.\" A smile crept over George's face. \"'Well, thank you, Zuzu.\" As Clarence smiled, he pointed a gloved finger and spoke in an oddly authoritative tone, even though his voice was slightly squeaky. \"You've had your Great Miracle, George, and it inspired you. Now go out and inspire the people of this town. If anyone can do it, it's you, George,\" he said warmly. . George walked with Zuzu. As he did, he thought of where he wanted to go first. He knocked on the door of Ma Bailey's Boarding House. The door opened. \"Mother,\" George said then shook his head. \"I'm sorry. I mean, Missus Bailey.\" \"You again,\" the old woman said in a cross voice with an equally cross look on her face. \"Sorry to bother you again. I'm a lot better than I was last time.\" \"Well?\" she said impatiently. \"It's cold out. Say what you got to say and be done with it.\" George found that strange. Why not just slam the door in his face? But maybe the woman was desperate for a little hope. George proceeded to try to offer some. \"Listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about Harry. I wish I'd been there to help save him.\" Frowning, the woman gave a light wave of her hand. \"Well, you weren't. So what are you going to do about it?\" When he spoke again, George stammered a little. \"I'm just saying try to remember the good times you had with him all those years ago. Imagine him all grown up if that will help. And, and I hope you find some peace and comfort somehow, Mother. Uh, Missus Bailey.\" She was silent, and her glare was not as harsh as before. After a moment, she quietly said, \"Thank you.\" Zuzu looked up at her. \"I hope you'll be all right somehow.\" Something like a smile formed on her grandmother's lips as she bent down a little. \"Thank you, dear.\" She was still smiling when she closed the door. George and Zuzu walked on until they encountered a taxicab. Sitting on the hood was the cab driver, a sullen-faced Ernie Bishop, along with an equally sullen-faced Violet Bick. Seeing George, Ernie quickly rose. \"You again,\" he said. With one hand still holding on to Zuzu, George held up an open palm. \"It's all right, Ernie. I know I acted a little strange last time but I've gotten a lot better.\" \"Not as crazy, huh? I would hope so.\" Using a gloved hand to guard the match flame, Ernie lit a cigarette. With his free hand, George pointed back and forth. \"Say, what's this? You and Violet know each other?\" A silent Violet simply looked more sullen as Ernie talked. \"Sure, we commiserate together. Nothing else to do in the happy land of Pottersville.\" He gestured with his thumb. \"Violet and I are old friends.\" \"That's very nice,\" Zuzu said. \"Oh, by the way, this is my daughter Zuzu..\" \"How do you do?\" she said with a slight curtsy. Ernie tipped his hat. \"And a good day to you, my dear.\" Then he made a face. \"Why is she wearing a flower on her coat when it's so cold out?\" George grinned. \"It's a Christmas Eve tradition with us. I even carry some of the petals in my pocket.\" Reaching in, George produced the petals and threw them like confetti. \"Interesting,\" Ernie said. \"And you say you're not that crazy?\" Next to him, Violet smirked a little. Bert the cop approached just then, hand on the gun in his holster. \"Is there a problem here?\" His dark eyes widened a little. \"You again.\" Slowly, George put up both hands. \"Take it easy, Bert. I won't be causing any trouble.\" \"Better not.\" Bert kept his hand near his holster. George relaxed his hands. Only a little. \"Listen, folks, I just wanted to say I know life here can't be easy. Things must be rough in Pottersville.\" Here, he spread his raised hands out a little. \"But whatever you do, don't buckle under to Potter. By that I mean don't let him get to you inside. If you have a change of attitude inside, the outside can change\" George curved both hands as he said, \"Look at me! I was at a hopeless point in my life. And then I was actually happy about going to jail!\" He laughed a little. As Eddie made a circling finger \"crazy\" gesture, Violet tittered. \"That can be arranged,\" Bert said flatly. George became a little flustered. \"It's a little hard to explain but what I mean is...The thing is, people stepped forward to help me. And you can help each other, just like you have been.\" He waved his hand. \"God knows people need all the help they can get in this place.\" \"Thank you, Mary Sunshine,\" Ernie said drily. George became a little more flustered still. \"I know it doesn't seem like much,\" he stammered. \"But the thing is, no matter where you are in life, you can start turning your life around, bit by bit, little by little. It starts with your attitude!\" \"Even when things are very bad, God may be able to help you inside,\" Zuzu said shyly from behind her father. Bending down, Violet smiled and said, \"Thank you, sweetie.\" Bert waved his gun hand. \"You should get the little one inside, out of the cold.\" \"You may be right,\" George said, clutching his coat. As George started to leave, Ernie lifted his chin. \"You may be a little daft, pal. But your little girl's all right.\" \"Thanks, Ernie.\" George offered a little wave. \"Take care.\" \"You, too,\" Ernie said. \"Bye,\" Violet said with a little wave. As George and Zuzu walked away, they once again encountered Clarence. \"Not sure what you're smiling about there, Clarence,\" George said. \"We didn't exactly do a bang-up job.\" Clarence continued to smile. \"It's all right, George. You planted a seed. It'll grow.\" He held out his arms, as if about to embrace them. \"Now it's time to go home.\" It wasn't like last time when George leaned on a bridge railing, and after he opened his eyes, he found hinself back where he belonged, no fanfare. This time, a great white light poured out of Clarence. And George saw that his friend was different. Oh, he still had the same bulbous nose and great big goofy grin. But he had neatly combed white hair and a wrinkle-free white suit that glowed. And he had wings. Oh, yes. Vast expansive wings almost twice as big as he was. George could hear the loud flutter of those great wings. Out of the white glow came the voice of Clarence. \"Goodbye, George. Thanks again for the wings.\" \"Goodbye, nice angel man!\" Zuzu said as she waved. \"Goodbye, Zuzu. Merry Christmas!\" Clarence and the white light were gone. Outside the old movie threater, a few couples shouted \"Merry Christmas.\" George knew he and Zuzu were back in Bedford Falls. \"We're back!\" George shouted, lifting his hands in the air. \"Ha-ha! Yeah! What do you know about that?\" Next to him, Zuzu smiled and laughed as she clapped her hands and jumped up and down. As they started in the direction of home, George said, \"Clarence sure looked a lot different. But he sounded just the same.\" Stopping, he looked up at the sky and winked. \"I suppose that was for our benefit, huh?\" \"You know what, Zuzu?\" George said as they stood there. \"I think they were very impressed with you in old Pottersville. Well, why shouldn't they be?\" Playfully and gently, he rubbed the top of her head. At the rubbing, Zuzu giggled as she tilted her head and closed one eye. As they walked on, she made an observation. \"They seemed very sad.\" \"Well, it's a very sad place. But I think, just like your old pop, they might get better. They might be okay somehow.\" They stopped, and George leaned down. \"I think you helped them feel better.\" \"I hope so. And I hope they'll be all right, too.\" They stood in front of the big old drafty house George had come to love so much. \"You know what?\" George said. \"What?\" George leaned down to whisper. \"Pottersville may be a nice place to visit. But I wouldn't want to live there.\" \"Oh, Daddy!\" Zuzu laughed. As he stood back up, George smiled and winked. \"I'm kidding. It's not a nice place at all. Let's never go back.\" \"Okay!\" Zuzu smiled as she vigorously nodded her head. \"Come on,\" George said as he took her hand. \"Let's go inside. The family is waiting.\" ","Summary":" \"Come on, Zuzu.

Inspired by the song My George Bailey from the musical version of It's A Wonderful Life. George Bailey could hardly believe almost year has passed and that Christmas was almost here again. 'Time flies by.' He thought to himself. After what had happened the previous year he was certainly most grateful to be alive. Christmas music was playing on the record player in the living room at 263 Sycamore Dt in Bedford Falls New York, a small suburb about an hour from New York City. One day as they were decorating the mantle piece in the living room his oldest daughter Janie looked at him curiously. \"Daddy, why did you never tell us why you almost jumped off the bridge last Christmas?\" She asked. George sighed. \"I don't like to dwell on that Janie.\" Janie folded her arms. \" You weren't mad at us were you? It sure seemed that way to me.\" Mary put her arm around her daughter. \"He wasn't mad with any of us. You have to understand that.\" George sighed again. \"Why did you have to bring this up Janie?\" Janie pulled out of Mary's embrace and stared her father straight in the eye. \" Because I deserve to know the answer Daddy. I think we all do. You can't avoid telling us forever you know.\" Mary went over to her husband and patted his shoulder. \"She does have a point George.\" \" Well everything was going wrong at the Building And Loan and I thought it was all my fault. Mr. Potter wanted to have me arrested for fraud.\" Janie's eyes filled with angry tears. \"But why would you want to end your life over something like that? That has always really bothered me Daddy. We all could have found a way to help you. That's what families do.\" \"Come here Janie.\" George whispered as he outstretched his arms Janie buried her face into her father's shoulder. \"I just don't understand any of it Daddy. I'm also still a little mad at you too.\" George ran his hands through his daughter's hair. \" I wasn't thinking clearly that night. I don't blame you for still being mad at me sweetheart. I guess I was being selfish.\" \"YOU GUESS?! How can you even say something like that?\" Mary touched her daughter's shoulder gently once again. \"An angel was looking over our family that night darling. Imagine how much angrier and sadder all of us would have been if your father had gone through with his suicide attempt and died.\" Janie sighed. \"You're right Mom. This still really upsets me a lot though.\" George pulled his wife into his embrace and kissed both Mary and Janie on the forehead. \"It took a very vulnerable moment for me to realize how special all of you are to me. I would have been really foolish to leave you all.\" \"We love you Daddy.\"Janie whispered \"You all mean the world to me.\" The next day when the mail came George noticed a Christmas card addressed to him. He smiled when he noticed it was from his friend Violet Bick. 'I always wondered what she did with that money from the loan.' He thought to himself as he opened the envelope. Mary entered the kitchen. \"Who's that Christmas card from dear? That New York City address doesn't look familiar.\" \"Violet. Remember how I gave her money last year for a loan to move to New York?\" \"I thought she gave it all back once she found out about the deficit.\" \"She did. Once the new year started I gave her a new loan right away. She really needed a change In her life. \" \"I never really cared much for Violet actually. I hope she's happier in New York.\" This was new information to George. He raised his eyebrows at his wife. \"Really? Why is that Mary?\" Mary shrugged. \"Ever since we were younger I thought she was too into herself and how she looked She just came off as really pretentious and snobby. Has she met any new boys in New York?\" George shrugged. \"It doesn't seem that she mentioned anything about that. I wouldn't be surprised if she runs into Sam and Angie every once in a while. They have a lot of single friends.\" \"Sam and Angie are in committed relationships though. Violet does not strike me as the kind of person who would want to settle down with anyone.\" George snuck up behind his wife and wrapped his arms around her. \" I wasn't crazy about the idea of marriage when we first talked about it either. Remember that day I came over your house when Sam was supposed to call you?\" Mary fell into her husband's embrace and kissed his lips passionately. \"Of course I do George. How could I forget?\" \"Why did your mother want you to marry Sam so badly Mary?\" George asked. Mary shrugged.\" I could never quite figure that out. She refused to listen to me when I said having lots of money did not matter to me. I knew all along we were meant to be together. Did I ever tell you that my brother Marty was totally against me being with Sam and always thought the two of us would end up together?\" George smiled. \"You'd think one of my best friends would know better than to keep a secret from me. What a sly dog.\" \"I wouldn't change anything for the world you know.\" Mary whispered. \"Neither would I sweetheart neither would I.\" George replied returning his wife's passionate kiss. \"Do you still want to see the world like you always dreamed about?\" Mary asked, George nodded. \"I do. How about once Zuzu and Tommy are a little older we all go on a nice family vacation? It would be wonderful to expose the children to different cultures.\" Mary's eyes lit up.\"I think that's a wonderful idea George!\". Suddenly two throats cleared in back of them. \"Mom,Daddy can we go sledding?\" Mary and George turned around and saw Zuzu & Tommy looking at them. George nodded. \"It will start to get dark soon but sure, we'll all go out for a little bit. Get your snow gear on and see if your brother and sister want to come outside too.\" \"Ok!\" They scampered away. Mary and George followed behind them to get their snow gear on. \"George, who gave you that Tom Sawyer book last Christmas?\" George smiled,\"Oh you mean Clarence. As I'm sure I told you he's an old friend.\" Mary looked dumbfounded. \"If he's your friend how come he's come over to the house before? I'm sure the children would love to meet him.\" George shrugged. \"He's a once in a lifetime type of friend I suppose.\" \"Did he save you from jumping off the bridge?\" George nodded. \"Yes,he also showed me a thing or two of what happened had I never been born.\" Mary's eyes grew wide with surprise. \"Really? Did I end up marrying Sam?\" \"No, actually you ended up as an old maid. Never got married or had any kids.\" Mary was silent for a few minutes. \"I think I would have been even more miserable if I had been alone my whole life then if I had married Sam instead of you.\" George put an arm around his wife and kissed her again. \"Was Clearance your guardian angel George?\" Mary asked. \"He did mention something when he first met me about being an angel in training. I am glad I could help him get his wings.\" \"He definitely answered our prayers that night. I would have been devastated had the outcome been different.\" Mary whispered. \"I love you Mary Jane Bailey.\" George said. Mary leaned in and kissed her husband softly on the cheek. \"I love you too darling. I always will. Until the day I die.\" And at that moment George Bailey could not be more blessed for his family.

May she rest in peace, Amen,\" Danielle and her parents finished their prayer, and walked out of the war room. Danielle headed to do her tons of homework while her parents started dinner. Thirty minutes later, she finished. \"Mom!\" she shouted. \"Yes?\" \"Can I have Jennifer over?\" \"Sure!\" \"Ok, thanks!\" Danielle ran to the phone and dialed. \"Hello?\" asked a quiet slow voice on the other end. \"Hi, Jennifer. Wanna come over?\" Danielle asked. \"No,\" replied her best friend flatly. Jennifer hung up. Danielle immediately knew something was wrong. She thought back to two years ago, when Jennifer had gotten cancer. She had fought it off, but Danielle still worried sometimes for her friend's life. The next day at school, Danielle asked Jennifer if she wanted to talk about it. Jennifer silently nodded her head. \"How about you come over after school?\" Danielle asked. Jennifer nodded her head again and attempted a smile. The rest of the day dragged on. When Danielle walked outside the school building, Jennifer was waiting. \"C'mon, Jennifer, let's go,\" she said. They walked home in silence Once at home the two girls walked into Danielle's room. Danielle sat down and waited. Finally, Jennifer spoke. \"My parents have been going out every night and when they come back they start yelling at me and won't make dinner for me and fight with each other and-and…\" Jennifer burst into tears. Danielle hugged her for a long time, then said, \"Let's go tell my parents. They'll know what to do.\" \"Oh, sweetie, it'll be ok,\" Danielle's mom cooed. \"Ma'am, I want what you have. Your family is always so positive…\" Jennifer trailed off. Suddenly she felt at peace. She felt like nothing had happened. A smile slowly trickled across her face. She felt like someone else was taking care of her. Danielle and her mom felt completely happy too. They couldn't wait to start explaining things to Jennifer. They prayed in their heads silently for a moment, asking God for wisdom. Over the next couple months, Jennifer spent a lot of time at the Jordans' house. They taught her the story of Christ, how he came to earth as a human, and died on the cross to pay the price for our sins, and then rose again. They taught her how to ask god to supply her every need. Jennifer also came to love the colorful, loving home of her BFF. Finally the day came when Jennifer asked God to come into her heart. There was much rejoicing in heaven and on earth. Everyone was happy. But another challenge lay ahead. Jennifer now was intent on bringing her parents the same joy that her best friend had brought to her. They weren't on their own, though. God was going to be fighting for them. It was a battle that couldn't be lost. Since Jennifer's parents were on a steady schedule of working and partying, they were hardly ever at home. So Danielle, Jennifer, Danielle's mom, Elizabeth, and her dad, Tony, spent all their free time in the war room asking God once again, for wisdom. On her birthday, Jennifer skipped home quickly, excited to talk to her parents. When she got home, she called, \"Mom?\" \"I'm in here!\" came the faint reply. Jennifer raced into her mother's bedroom, only to find her sobbing. \"Mom! What's wrong?\" she cried. Her mother sighed and said, \"Sweetie, your dad got into a fight. He's in the hospital right now, but the doctors are saying it doesn't look good. Jennifer suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotion. She sat down, letting the news sink in. finally she said, \"Is he gonna be okay?\" \"I don't know. Listen, Jennifer?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm sorry we haven't been paying much attention to you lately. I know I don't deserve to be forgiven, but I'm asking for you to forgive me.\" \"But mom, God forgave us when we didn't deserve it. He even sent his son down to DIE for us no matter how much we sinned! Of course I will forgive you!\" The response startled her mother. \"Wh-who is this God?\" she stuttered. \"Why did his son die for us? Why did he do this?\" the questions kept firing out. \"How about I explain over dinner?\" Jennifer suggested. \"Okay,\" replied her mother, still dazed. But Jennifer, despite her father, couldn't have been happier. She was doing it! While she and her mom made dinner, she silently asked God for wisdom. Then she was ready. But when they sat down, the phone rang. Every time her mother sat down, the phone would ring again. Her mother had completely forgotten her again. Jennifer went to bed that night feeling depressed and confused. Jennifer's mother was in the kitchen, cooking. Her father was in the den reading the newspaper. Jennifer was busily munching a piece of toast. Life was perfect. Suddenly, Jennifer had something wonderful to tell her parents. She rushed over to her mother, excited to share her feelings, when suddenly, she couldn't run. Something was holding her back. No matter how hard she tried she couldn't go anywhere. And no matter how loud she screamed no one seemed to hear her. Jennifer woke up from her dream sweating and feverish. She called to her mom, but there was no response. Her throat hurt and she was hot all over. She knew she had a fever. She stumbled over to her mother's phone in the living room and called Danielle's mom's number. \"Hello?\" came a sleepy reply. \"Mrs. Jordan?\" asked Jennifer feebly. \"Jennifer?\" came the reply. Suddenly Jennifer collapsed. She was rushed to the hospital. She had gone into a coma. She didn't wake up for three days. Even when she woke up, it was clear that she was dying. When Jennifer woke up there were three people at her side. Her mother, Danielle, and Danielle's mother. She was immediately surrounded by hugs, and kisses, and are-you-feeling-any-betters. \"I feel fine. But mom, I never got to tell you\"… She coughed. \"About-God,\" She managed to get out. \"Ok, right after I give you your birthday present,\" her mother replied. She handed her a blue Bible with her name engraved on it in silver letters. \"Jennifer looked questioningly at her mom, then Danielle, then Danielle's mom. They were all smiling. \"When I found out about you going into a coma,\" her mother began. \"I immediately thought to myself, she wanted to tell me something, but I got carried away. I had to know what it was. So I came and asked Elizabeth. I believe Jennifer. But we got carried away with other things after you were born. So we forgot.\" \"Oh, and by the way, your father is doing well… just then, the doctor walked in \"I'm sorry. The tests aren't good. The cancer you were fighting before never really left for real. There is no way to stop it now. Tears brimmed in Jennifer's mother's eyes. Then everyone started crying. They stayed until visiting hours were over, talking and crying, and talking and crying some more. But they had to leave. That night Jennifer went to sleep. It was a sleep she would never come out of. A sleep that caused much sadness on earth, and much rejoicing in heaven. The doctors were surprised that she lasted until nighttime. She had been holding onto life, she had to know that her mother and father were safe in the arms of the heavenly father. She wouldn't give up, until she had succeeded in her mission. Her rescue mission. ","Summary":" Rescue Mission \" Thank you for Ms. Clara, and for everything she did for our family.

Bitter cold. George Bailey's lip was bleeding from the fight he'd just gotten into at the bar with Mr. Welch. He had never felt so defeated in his life. He felt like no one could bring him out of his despair… and on all days of the year it just so happened to be on Christmas Eve. \"Where did I go wrong? What has made me turn into this bitter horrible person?\" He yelled at the sky. He trudged through the snow until he got to the bridge. 'This will be all over once I jump into the river.\"He thought to himself miserably. Suddenly a thought crossed his mind. \" Mary. The kids. They're going to miss me once I'm gone. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.\" He was standing on the bridge about to jump in to the cold icy river when suddenly headlights rounded the corner and came into his view. It was snowing a little so he couldn't see who was in the car. \"George!\" Someone called his name out the window of the car. It was his friend Bert the police officer. The window was frosted and he couldn't make out who else was in the car but there were at least two other people. The ignition of the car cut off. Bert got out of the car along with Ernie the cab driver and George's oldest son Pete. \"What are you doing George?\" Bert asked. \" I hope you're not going to jump.\" Ernie added. George did not know what to say.. Especially in front of his son. \"Here let me help you down.\" Ernie extended his hand to his friend. \"Pete get the blanket out of the backseat for your dad.\" Bert instructed. Pete nodded and came back with the blanket a few minutes later.\"What's wrong Pop, why did you disappear like that?\" \"Everything just happened so fast between the Building and Loan and then the fight at the bar with . I guess everything was just building up and building up.\" \"We've all been worried sick about you George… Especially Mary.\" Ernie said. Pete nodded. \"Yeah Pop, Mom's been real upset. She kept it together for awhile but about two hours ago she started crying and hasn't come out of the bedroom. I think she'll be so happy to know that you're okay.\" George felt a huge lump rise in his throat. He could not believe that his actions had upset his family this much. \"Thank you guys for stopping me before I made a huge mistake.\" He whispered. \"That's what friends are for.. And sons too let's get you home.\" Ernie said The door to the Bailey's house opened as soon as the car pulled into the driveway. Mrs. Bailey's face lit up. \" George,where on earth were you? Uncle Billy has important news he wants to tell you. Bert and Ernie must have told you how worried everyone has been about you.\" George nodded. Once they entered the house Mrs. Hatch looked at her son in law sternly. \"Of all the inconsiderate things you could have done on Christmas Eve George. Mary has been beside herself. She hasn't come out of the bedroom for two hours.\" \"I'm sorry I scared everyone.\" \"I would certainly hope so. Pete, would you go upstairs and get your mother please?\" Mrs. Hatch asked her grandson. Pete nodded.\" Sure thing Grandma.\" Mrs. Bailey led George into the living room and sat him down in from the of the fireplace. \"I'll go get Uncle Billy so he can tell you his news. You just sit here and get warm.\" George nodded. A few minutes later his mother and uncle reentered the parlor. \"George, where the heck did you go? Everyone in town heard about the deficit at the bank and rallied their money together for you.\" Uncle Billy threw his nephew a grin. George's eyes widened. \" Are you serious?\" Uncle Billy nodded. \" Yes, indeed. People in Bedford Falls sure are generous during the holidays.\" \"There's really enough to cover the whole amount?\" Uncle Billy nodded again. \"That's amazing!\" \"That's for sure.\" Mrs. Bailey said. A few minutes later Pete and Mary entered the parlor. \"Oh, George, I 've been so worried about you! Why on earth would you disappear like that on Christmas Eve?\" Mary embraced her husband. \"As I was telling the boys things were building up and building up. I couldn't take all the stress anymore. The conversation with Janie's teacher sort of put me over the edge I guess.\" \"Why on earth were you on the bridge George? Thank goodness Ernie, Bert and Pete found you!\" Mary looked at her husband curiously. George took a gulp of air. \"I was going to jump into the river.\" Mary and Mrs. Bailey exchanged a worried glance. \"But why George! What would even cause you to do something like that?\" His mother asked. \"I just explained the reason Mother.\" \" That's ridiculous George!\" Mrs. Bailey's eyes flashed with anger. \"Pop,you really scared us you know.\" Pete said George gulped. \" I didn't realize that would happen. I feel awful.\" \"How could you NOT realize that George? So many people care about you! Have you forgotten that?\" Mary's eyes filled with angry tears. George stood up and pulled Mary into his arms. \" I wasn't thinking straight Mary. As I said I feel awful.\" \"If you had died I would have been devastated.\" Mary whispered. \"I guess sometimes I just don't feel appreciated. So many people are asking me to do things for them and that's really been bugging me too.\" George said sighing heavily. \" Why didn't you just talk to me George?\" Mary asked. \"I don't know.\" George said. Mrs. Bailey smiled softly. \"It's ridiculous for you to think like that George. Of course people appreciate you.\" \" Of all days why pick Christmas Eve to something like this George?\" Uncle Billy asked. \" As I said before stuff was building up and building up and that conversation with Mrs. Welch put me over the edge.\" George kissed Mary. \"I'm sorry for everything Mary.

I also determined I need to write more It's A Wonderful Life stories. This one features the oldest Bailey Child Pete. I own no character from It's A Wonderful Life . Pete's love interest is my original character. In the play the ages of the Bailey Children are not specified so I am left to assume that Pete is 13 and is in 8th grade and Janie is 11 and in 6th grade. Pete Bailey had always despised Valentine's Day. He never really understood the point behind it and never participated in any Valentine's Day festivities at school. His parents had been called in for many parent/teacher conferences over the years. Pete was now a teenager and dreaded the holiday even more than in pervious years because his friends were starting to take notice of the girls in their class and ask them on dates. \"Sweetheart are you going to the dance tonight?\" His mother asked \"No, you know I hate Valentines Day Ma.\" Mary Bailey always worried about her oldest son being Anti social. \"Can't you go have a good time even though you don't have a date?\" \"Gotta go Ma!\" Pete ran out the door to go meet the bus without even answering his mother's question. Two minutes later Janie came down the stairs. \"Hurry up! You're going to miss the bus!\" Janie was bubbling over with excitement. \"Remember Mom I'm going over Alissa's after school today so a bunch of us can get ready for the dance.\" \"See if you can get your brother to go too.\" \"Why does Valentine's Day always make him so grouchy?\" Janie asked Mary sighed and shrugged her shoulders. \"He's always hated this holiday, Your father and I never really understood why. It's always been frustrating!\" The school bus horn honked outside. \"Happy Valentine's Day Mom, I love you.\" Janie kissed her mother on the cheek. \"I love you too darling. Have a great day!\" Once Janie got on the bus she took the seat across the aisle from Pete. \"Can't you sit somewhere else and leave me alone?\" \"No Pete. Mom is worried about you. I wanted to talk to you about it.\" Pete sighed. \"I want nothing to do with this dumb holiday or that dance tonight.\" Why can't you two stop getting on my case about it?\" \"I think you know that the dance will be fun.\" \"It won't be! I have never liked them.\" \"Why does Valentine's Day make you so grouchy Pete?\" Pete sighed.\" I don't know Janie. Buzz off! Go sit with your friends and stop bugging me about the dance.\" Janie sighed realizing this conversation was going to get her nowhere. \"Whatever! Mom just doesn't want you alone by yourself on a Friday night. If that's the way you want things to be suit yourself!\" The cheerleading team's annual fundraiser for their competition was selling Valentines Day carnations and today was the delivery date. Each cheerleader was responsible for going to from class room to classroom to deliver the flowers during 3rd period. One of the cheerleaders Alana was in Pete's English class. \"Pete, you got two flowers!\" Pete rolled his eyes. 'Does this holiday have to get people so excited?' He thought to himself. \"Whatever.\" He grunted. \"You should act a little more excited!\" \"Just put the dumb flowers down.\" Alana placed the flowers on his desk and walked down the row of desks to the next person. Pete looked at the tags on the flowers. The first one was from his sister. 'She's so annoying. ' Pete ripped the note off the flower and crumpled it in a ball. The second note caught his eye. Pete- I think you are swell. You are a really sweet boy. I hope to get to know you better. The tag was signed Your Secret Admirer. 'This has to be some kind of trick someone is playing on me. Everyone knows I can't stand this holiday' At lunch his friends noticed his flowers. \"Who sent you the flowers Petey?\" \"My dorky sister sent me one. Got no clue who the other one's from.' His friends grinned at him. \"We got a mystery on our hands.\" \"Who do you fellas think it could be? Pete asked \"Well there is that new girl who just moved here from Jersey.. Maybe it's her.\" His friend James suggested. \"Who?\" \"Her name's Betsy Reynolds.\" Pete shrugged. \"Which one is she?\" \"Tall, auburn hair brown eyes. She's in Biology with us.\" Pete shrugged. \"Honestly, I don't think I met her yet.\" \"You going to the dance tonight Petey?\" His other friend Carlos asked. \" You won't catch me at that sappy Valentine's Day dance!\" \" You don't think you might meet the person who sent you the flower?\" \"It's probably one of those ditzy cheerleaders playing a trick on me. Everyone in this school knows how much I hate this dumb holiday.\" \"Come to dance with us just to see if she'll be there.\" Pete was starting to get annoyed. \" I don't even know who sent me the dumb flower.\" \"You might be surprised with who it is.\" \"You fellas know something I don't?\" James & Carlos shrugged. \"Just come to the dance Petey!\" \"I'll think about it, alright?\" . His friends nodded. Pete spent the rest of the day wondering who his mysterious admirer was. He caught a glance of Betsy out of the corner of his eye in Biology. 'She is kinda pretty.' He thought to himself. When he got home from school his mother noticed the flowers right away. \"Who are the flowers from?\" \"Janie & some secret admirer.\" Mary's ears perked up. \"That's a new development! Looks like the girls at school are noticing you. \" \"Jimmy & Carlos think I should go to the dance tonight just to see if that girl is there.\" 'Thank the lord for Jim & Carlos' Mary thought to herself. \"That's great sweetheart. If you don't want to stay the whole time your father or I could always pick you up early.\" There was silence. \"You really want me to go that dance don't ya Ma?\" Mary nodded. \"If girls are taking interest in you then you should certainly acknowledge it.\" Pete sighed. \"Alright.\" The gym was decorated in pink & red with cupids shooting arrows hanging from the ceiling. \"Student council did a decent job with decorations.\" Jim said. \"Uh-huh.\" Pete grunted. Alana came up to them grinning. \"Pete , come with me. I got someone I want you to meet.\" Pete rolled his eyes. \"Can't you buzz off Alana?\" \"You'll really like her, I promise!\" Pete sighed. \" Guess I'll be back in a minute fellas.\" Alana pulled Pete away from his friends and over to where some of her cheerleading friends were standing. Much to his surprise Betsy was with them too. \"Pete, this is Betsy. She's my new next door neighbor.\" Betsy smiled. \"I know you! You're in my biology class.\" \"Nice to meet you officially.\" Pete smiled. \"You too.\" Betsy returned the smile. A song started to blare from the loudspeaker. \"Wanna dance?\" Pete asked Betsy smiled \"I'd love too.\" Pete escorted her to the dance floor. \"So why'd you move here all the way from Jersey? \" \"My parents just split up and my mom moved here. She wanted to get out of the city.\" \"Got any brothers or sisters?\" Betsy nodded. \"One older sister who's in 11th grade and one younger brother who's in 5th grade \"What are their names?\" \"Caroline and Manuel. What about you?\" Pete smiled. \"I'm the oldest of 4. My sister Janie is 11, my sister Zuzu is is 9 and my brother Tommy is 7.\" \"Zuzu is sure an interesting name.\" \"Her real name is Susan but my sister and I couldn't really pronounce it when we were little so Zuzu stuck as a nickname.\" \"Do you like Bedford Falls?\" Pete asked Betsy shrugged \"Still trying to get adjusted. It's much different than my old town.\" \"It'll grow on ya. All the people are nice here.. We have a real tight knit community.\" Betsy got really quiet. \"What's wrong?\" \"I know you're trying to figure out who gave you that carnation. Jimmy told me during Biology \" \"You got any idea who it was? That's been bugging me all day.\" \"It was from me \" His jaw dropped. \"Really?\" Betsy nodded. \"Yeah. I don't really know a lot of guys yet. Alana told me how much you hate Valentines Day so I figured I'd do something to raise your spirits.\" 'Why can't Alana just mind her own business?' He thought to himself. \"That was real nice of you. Thank you so much!\" \"You're welcome\" Betsy whispered. This Valentines Day hadn't turned out half so bad after all.

Thanks again for that loan you offered back to me once business was back on it's feet again. I will never, ever forget all the help you have given me and everyone else in Bedford Falls over the years. You are truly the nicest man I have ever known. Heaven knows I've met more than my fair share of men. That's why I am writing to you. You see I kind've lied to you about why I have moved to the Big Apple. Before last Christmas when I was still living in Bedford Falls, I was feeling sick. I was later diagnosed with cancer and they suggested a move to the city where they would have better treatments for me. I like to think I really haven't lied to you. I really did need a new enviornment but I just couldn't tell you why. I don't want you to feel sorry for me, George. Yes, it has been rough on me with the move and all these treatments that honestly only make me feel worse than better. Yet, here I am still hanging on. I got a part-time job as a secretary to an electric company. I can only do part-time work because of all my medical reasons but I get by. I have made some wonderful friends since working here. Speaking of friends, won't you tell Mary hello for me? I would greatly appreciate that. I hope my letter finds you doing well, and Mary, and all of your precious children. Love, Violet Bick Tears welled up in George's eyes as he finished her letter. He felt so bad for her, even though she had told him not to, he couldn't help it. Sure, she was the girl with the not-so-good reputation. Sure, she was the girl that was annoying because she was always seeminly \"on\" to him. Yet, George was able to see that Violet was a good girl underneath it all. The tears didn't nessicarily come from the letter itself but from the fact that Violet had been dead for about a month now. She passed away even before the letter showed up in his family's mailbox and by that time the news had been spread. That was always the way it was in a small town. The tiniest bit of news: a wedding, a birth, a death, it would always spread like wildfire. The wildfire news of death was always the most devastating, especially that of a still relatively young woman. George was jerked out of his thoughts by the church bell. It was now five o'clock and George could get ready to call it another day. As he was putting on his coat, he was reminded of what an old friend had told him. Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. \"I know you already have a pair, Violet,\" he says to himself with a smile. ","Summary":" 2/14/47 Dear George, Well, I've made it to New York!

I am writing my very first fanfic for \"It's A Wonderful Life\" and one which takes place after the movie. While IAWL was definitely a good film and, in fact, Frank Capra's best, if you ask me, one glaring problem was the fact that Mr. Potter, even after all the vile, horrid things he did, never got what for. So in this story, which, as mentioned before, is post-movie, karma catches up to Potter and the nasty old bastard gets what he so very richly deserves in quite the ironic and hilarious way. I guarantee you that this story will be not a drop short of satisfying for everyone reading it, for very obvious and understandable reasons. I own none of the characters. They all belong to \"It's A Wonderful Life\" and therefore were made by Frank Capra. No More Mr. Potter Henry F. Potter had, about an hour after George Bailey had run by his office and wished him a Merry Christmas, to which he replied \"And a happy New Year to you…in jail! Go on home, they're waiting for you!\" decided he had finished work enough to call it a night. So he told his bodyguard to push his wheelchair as so he would be able to bring him home from the bank that he worked at. He said to him: \"All right, business is concluded for the night. Get me out of here.\" So his mute bodyguard did as he was told, pushing his wheelchair out of his office. But just as the two of them were passing by some stairs on the way to the doors of Mr. Potter's bank, a sudden and outright unexpected turn of events took place. The bodyguard tripped after misjudging the latest of steps he took, and fell right down onto Potter, who went: \"What the hell?!\" before he and the bodyguard were both tumbling over towards the stairs. Mr. Potter's wheelchair also fell over, as the bodyguard, in falling onto him, had both crashed into the wheelchair and gotten his feet caught under it, making it so it was lifted off of the ground just as Potter fell out of it. So both men and the wheelchair were going right in the direction of the stairway, and it wasn't long before all three of them were falling down the long flight of stairs, too. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\" Potter screamed, and not only did every single last bone in his body get broken due to the way that he fell and hit every step on the way down the stairs, but besides how much the same happened to the bodyguard as he, too, tumbled down the stairway, it just so happened that the wheelchair, in crashing down the stairs, slammed hard first into Potter's bodyguard and then into Potter himself, bringing the bodyguard with it. When all three had made contact with each other, both Potter and his bodyguard were as good as doomed. The two men and the wheelchair continued to go down the stairs at a rapid and nonstop rate, and furthermore, the broken bones in the bodies of Potter and his bodyguard had, in fact, ruptured their vital organs, causing internal bleeding. By the time the three stairway victims had reached the bottom, it wasn't certain whether Potter and his bodyguard were dead or not, but here was the thing. Both men would have died in a matter of moments, the state they were in just now. But it was a sped up dying process for them that occurred when the wheelchair landed on them both, in the process hitting them one last time, and made it so that they had most definitely been killed in full. It fell down right next to them, busted up and worthless now, but it was certainly in far, far better shape than Potter and his bodyguard were, because they were both completely dead. And don't think it ends here. Because after Potter and his bodyguard had died, you can guess that both of them went straight down to hell! And sure enough, they found that they'd wound up at the fiery gates of hell, with the hosts of heaven not even bothering to judge them, due to knowing all they'd done in their lives, especially Potter. Yeah, the angels had learned a lot about them from their fellow angel, Clarence, during the time he was given his wings and being congratulated on a job well done by the ones he was given the assignment of helping George Bailey to. So, it should be no surprise that Potter and his bodyguard were, after death, transported directly to the gates of hell, and said gates got opened by some demons, one of which said: \"So we've got some new arrivals just now, have we?\" Another demon said: \"It would appear to be so, indeed! Mr. Henry F. Potter and his mute bodyguard, am I right?\" \"Y-y-y-y-yes…\" Potter trembled, unable to say anything else due to how afraid he suddenly was. A third demon said: \"Come on in, then! We've got a special place in our place for you, after all you did in your miserable, wretched life, Potter!\" A fourth demon added: \"And as for you, his bodyguard, you may not have done what he did, but to work for someone as evil as that is a sure ticket to hell, as I believe you've just learned! So you come on in, too!\" Knowing that neither of them had any choice, Potter and his bodyguard walked into the gates, which the four demons swiftly closed and locked behind them. \"Oh, king Lucifer!\" called out one of the demons. \"We have two new arrivals here!\" \"It is Henry F. Potter and his bodyguard!\" another demon beckoned. It wasn't long before Satan got to showing up, and he said: \"Ah, Mr. Potter! And your mute bodyguard, too! I've been watching the two of you for some time, especially you, Potter! Doing all you could to add more money to your already overflowing bank account without regard for anyone else! Driving George Bailey to nearly commit suicide! And everything you did before and in-between those things, plus what all the world would have been like without George Bailey, thanks to you, for shame!\" Satan subsequently impaled Potter with his pitchfork and lit him on fire, then he used his free hand to take a hold of the bodyguard and squeeze him hard, right before also making him be lit aflame and tossing him into a pool of lava. While the bodyguard got swallowed up by the lava he had just been tossed into, Satan made a giant pot of boiling oil form in front of the screaming, burning Potter. He said to him: \"As you are corrupt with the most despicable of the seven deadly sins, namely, greed and avarice, your punishment in my kingdom will be that you'll be boiled the fuck alive in oil! Ironically, it's the most valuable, expensive and high quality oil that money can possibly buy, but it's boiling either way!\" He grabbed Potter and slammed him into the pot of oil, adding in: \"Fitting that your form of eternal suffering would be in a pot, Potter! You made the blood of so many boil in life, so it's now time for you to be boiled yourself in death! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Potter screamed out: \"E-RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\" as he was boiled alive in the oil that he found himself unable to get out of, and Satan pushed the pot of oil so that it slid far away from the gates of hell and into where there were more demons, who would be able to bite, claw and beat at Potter whenever they wanted. Furthermore, the way that Potter had been set afire before being placed in the boiling oil meant he was being burned and tortured in two ways at once, and the additional demon torment he'd receive made it so that he'd get tortured in multiple ways at once, two ways of burning, two ways of being cut and one way of being beaten. Just as he was trapped forever in that pot of oil, his bodyguard was trapped forever in that pit of lava, and both had been dealt a nasty blow, and a well deserved one, at that, by the hands of karma, with everyone else in Bedford Falls living quite a wonderful life, and of course happily ever after. Especially George Bailey and his family. THE END How was it for you? Please rate and review, everybody! ","Summary":" Greetings, all of you wonderful readers!

It's a Wonderful Latte \"So tell me, in simple words that someone who isn't an angel can understand; what happened?\" To a passerby it would seem that two men were talking on a grimy, snowy bench along a main street of a small town. \"Congratulations George, you got your wish and you officially were never born\" Clarence Odbody, Angel second class announced. \"I told you you'd find the world is a much different place.\" \"Oh really,\" George Bailey said sourly \"I suppose Europe isn't there any more, just magically disappeared. Just as well, I never got there anyway.\" He had been having a bad day before he wished he'd never been born, and it had gone downhill from there. \"No, I mean the world you knew. The whole world is a big place, and a lot of it doesn't know the difference between one person and the next. But certainly Bedford Falls isn't the same anymore, as you noticed. In fact there isn't any place in the country named Bedford Falls now.\" \"All because I wasn't born? How can that be?\" George was confused, but trying to make some sense of what he had just witnessed as he walked around the town. He thought it would have been better if he had never been born, but this wasn't the town he knew. \"Ripples in a pond, George. Make one change by throwing in a pebble and the waves spread out in all directions. Some pebbles are bigger than others, and the waves go farther. You were a pretty big pebble, George.\" \"What did I do that was so important? I just owned a couple coffee shops where people could come in, grab their cup on the wall and sit down for a bit. If they bought a muffin it was a big day for both of us, otherwise I'm just a nobody.\" \"And yet a world without you ended up with what you saw today; Pottersville.\" \"Yes, but how?\" \"Let me take it one thing at a time, and I'll tell you. I can't afford to flub this assignment or else I won't get my wings for at least another millennia; it took me three times that just to fill out all the paperwork for the application. I told you that you were never born, right?\" \"So you say. No one seems to know me here.\" \"Right. We'll skip your childhood, but do you remember your first job?\" \"Sure. Mr. Gower hired me at his story. I did just about everything there; cleaning up, behind the soda counter, sales and deliveries. That place was closed when we walked by.\" \"That's right. Well, Mrs. Wainstard came in one day and ordered her usual pastrami sandwich. Well, she was so hungry she ate half of it before she realized she was eating pickles.\" \"She can't have pickles, she's allergic!\" \"I know that, and you know that. But you didn't exist to stop Gower from making the sandwich with pickles. He made it right dozens of times before, but just once his mind was somewhere else and he made a mistake. She went into anaphylactic shock and died. Gower ended up killing himself grieving over his mistake.\" \"But what about the name of the town?\" \"You were a shining beacon to people who wanted to start all their own little businesses. In the Bedford Falls you knew, there were bakeries and floral shops, fix-it places and even a laundromat. But without your inspiration and encouragement, people just let someone else do it if it was ever done at all. How many other people hung out at your coffee shop and worked on plans to open their own business?\" \"A few. We'd mostly talk, and I'd tell 'em what I had learned or if I had any good ideas to do something different.\" George thought back to long sessions where some of his customers brainstormed and dreamed. If he wasn't too busy he'd try to throw in his two cents worth. \"Those people were never encouraged enough to do anything. Any dreams or ideas they had died from neglect with no one and no place to work it out. The only real businessman in town was Henry Potter, and all he saw was pennies and dollars. If it wasn't going to make him a solid return on his investment, he wasn't interested. You smelled that coffee shop we walked past?\" \"Yeah, Potter's Cup. It smelled horrible.\" \"From what I've seen, people weren't too happy drinking it either. But it's the only game in town, and no one has the gumption to start a place of their own anymore. Why did you start your place?\" \"Because I wanted a place to get a decent cup of coffee while I was away from home. A place\" George thought back \"where a person could come in, grab their cup off the wall and sit with friends. Maybe meet someone special. Hey, wait a minute; speaking of someone special, what about Mary? She was working at a library when I tried to talk to her a few minutes ago.\" \"Mary Hatch never met you George. Never met anyone like you, and never married. She tried to get a degree in business, but fell asleep while studying and failed a critical final. Your coffee and encouragement would have kept her awake, George.\" \"Mary with a degree? She's always been good keeping the books, have I been keeping her from her dream Clarence?\" \"No, she doesn't have that dream right now, she's too busy. But you could help encourage her George, if only you were alive.\" \"So all the little things I've done have added up over time?\" George asked, beginning to see the light. \"That's right. It's those ripples from the pebble. Big things like keeping Mrs. Wainstard from pickles and telling Sandy where she could buy linens more cheaply for her diner. A hundred smaller things too, things like sobering up Frank when he had one too many celebrating his first kid, or giving your unsold muffins to the Smith family to help feed them.\" \"You know about them too?\" \"Our files on you are quite complete, George. We also know that you treat your employees well, and deal fairly with all the other people from whom you buy your supplies. More ripples, George. But don't get a big ego there; everyone makes their own ripples too. Now does your life seem so bad?\" \"No, I don't suppose it does after all; this world is too dark and cold for me. Can I have it back the way it was?\" George asked. \"If you want. You'll have the bad with the good, just like before. The health inspector will be coming next week, Tommy still has a broken arm, and your car still needs a new motor. But everything will be restored if you want; it's your choice.\" George turned fully to Clarence. \"Clarence, I want it more than anything in the world.\" \"I was hoping you'd say that. It's done.\" \"That's all? No snapping fingers, clapping your hands or counting to three?\" Clarence sighed. \"Showmanship. It really isn't looked upon too well in our profession. If you want theatrics, I recommend you go see a magic show. Now look across the street.\" George turned his head and looked. The abandoned store had changed, and was now again his primary coffee shop called 'It's a Wonderful Latte'. Through the front window he could see several familiar faces laughing and talking while they sat with their hands around a warm cup. \"Clarence, I don't know how to thank you\" George said, but when he turned back he was alone on the bench. The space beside him showed no signs of anyone ever having sat there. He jumped up and ran across the street to burst into the shop. \"Close the door George, you're letting our heat out!\" Mary yelled from across the room. Several people turned and greeted him. He strode quickly over to Mary and embraced her while giving her an unforgettable kiss. \"Mary, I want you to think about something. Have you ever thought about going to school to get a degree?\" he asked her. \"I don't know, George. I've always been interested in business, but it takes too much time. Maybe in a couple years.\" \"Couple years nothing. Let's start now. Let's grab a cup and sit down and we'll have our own planning session; after Christmas break would be a perfect time to get you started. We'll work it out somehow, I know we can.\" \"Oh George, that sounds lovely. Grab your cup and meet me at the table.\" Mary walked away and George almost skipped to the large pegboard that held the cups for all the regulars. He pulled his off the peg, and then noticed an extra peg and cup at the bottom. The name 'Clarence Wings' was painted on the cup. \"Atta boy, Clarence!\" George said to himself.

Sunglasses covering their eyes, Mary's bathing suit barely covering her body and a cold glass of lemonade in hand, life was good. Pete was chasing Janie around with the garden hose. They always loved torturing one another. They were siblings, what do you expect? George always found it funny how they were named after one another's in-laws. Peter of course was his deceased father so his oldest son was named Peter John in his honor. Jane was Mary's mother who famously never accepted the fact George was her son-in-law. At least this Jane Marie loved and adored him. Though she did have her moments where she could be a little witchy. Little Tommy was swinging on the big oaktree branch. He was their real wild child. Anytime he could climb on anything, he would jump on it, and then flip off on it like a trapeze artist. George always thought they should buy stock in band-aids because of that kid of theirs. Yet nothing could stop Thomas George, no matter how many bruises and cuts he got. Then there was Zuzu. She was born Susan Grace, but her older siblings could never pronounce it, she was always \"Zuzu\" to them. By the time she was one, that was what everybody called her. She was an angel on the inside and out. She had golden hair and she had a golden heart. Her eyes were as blue as the Lord's blue sky and her freckles were as if she was kissed by the angels themselves. She was sitting idly just picking the dandelions and making little bouquets out of them. \"This is the life,\" Mary says, gesturing her glass to his. \"Sure is,\" George says, clinking their glasses together. \"Remember last Christmas?\" \"Dont' ruin this moment,\" George says chuckling. \"No, seriously,\" Mary says giggling. \"Remember when your brother made that toast to you about being the richest man in town.\" \"Yeah,\" George says, the memory flooding back to him. \"It's true.\" \"We are pretty blessed,\" he had to agree. He looked away from Mary and back to his children. All of them playing and laughing. The sun beating down on everyone, making everything look so much brighter.

He screamed for the strange little man who had brought him to this place, that George thought truly was Hell. \"Clarence! Clarence! Help me!\" George turned a corner and ran down an empty dark alley. A single light lit up a doorway. George knew where he was at, the bank. Potter's bank. There was a 2x4 to George's right. He grabbed it and said aloud. \"If I'm stuck in this place, a nobody with no wife, no kids, no family, no friends, and no purpose, the least I should do is see that no good, lousy, evl crook Potter draw his last breath!\" As George walked towards the door, Clarence appeared out of thin air and blocked him from proceeding. \"Clarence!

He's taken everything and everyone away from me and I want to see him die!\" \"Okay George, but you're not going to like this either.\" Clarence snapped his finger and the door opened. The two men walked into Potter's bank. \"It's 1928 George.\" \"The year my Father died.\" \"Yes.\" George heard two familiar voices arguing. It was his father and that bastard Potter. He ran into Potter's office. \"I've fought you for years and years Potter, and I'm tired. I'm not well and I haven't been since my boy Harry died. I can't do it anymore.\" \"So you've finally come to sell me that worthless business of yours?\" Potter laughed was so evil it sent chills down everyone's spine. What happened next sent those chills back the other way. Mr. Bailey pulled a gun out of his jacket and pointed it at Potter. Shaking, with tears in his eyes, Mr. Bailey lamented: \"You are a miserable asshole, Potter and you have ran me and mine down for years. You have taken everything and everyone I love away from me! You have destroyed this town and turned it into Hell on Earth!\" George rushed to the side of the man that was his father in another world. \"Dad don't do this! It's murder!

They don't even know we are here! I keep telling you. Your life had a purpose. Chief among them was for your father's sake. He loved you and he loved Harry! Without you both his life had no purpose. No reason!\" Clarence disappeared. Unmoved by the emotional Mr. Bailey, Potter retorted. \"What are you going to do Bailey? Shoot me?! You don't have the guts!\" \"I'll show you what I have Potter! I'm going to send you to Hell where you belong!\" \"You don't have it in you. You never did! That's why I always win Bailey! Because I have the guts to do what is necessary to be number one! You'll always be number two! Because you're a gutless, spineless, loser!\" Mr. Bailey closed his eyes and fired his gun. The bullet struck Potter in cold black heart killing him instantly. Mr. Bailey dropped the gun to the ground and fell to his knees. He began gasping for air and he clutched his chest in pain. He fell to the ground still gasping for air. George rushed to his side and grabbed for his hand. Mr. Bailey spoke out in a grave whisper. \"G- G- George!\" \"Dad. Pop. You know me?\" \"Y-y-you have, have, have...A wonderful life! D-d-d-d-don't waste it! Live it! Enjoy it!\" With that, Mr. Bailey expired in George's arms. George ran out of the bank. \"The bridge!

He banged on the window and yelled \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!\" Potter looked at the crazed man in the window and replied gruffly, \"And a Happy New Year to you…in jail! Go on home, they're waiting for you.\" After George ran off towards his home, Potter grumbled to his bodyguard, \"Why is he so happy? He's got the bank examiner and the sheriff waiting at his home, ready to haul him off to prison.\" He grunted and a slight smile ran across his face. \"At least I'll finally be rid of that thorn in my side, and about time!\" He looked at his bodyguard and said, \"Go and get the car warmed up. I'll be ready to go in about 10 minutes.\" With that, the other man left the office and closed the door. Potter continued going over the last little bit of paperwork on his desk. He was looking forward to going home to his mansion to spend a quiet Christmas Eve…alone…just the way he wanted. As he tucked the page he was reading into a folder, he gave a tired sigh and looked toward the window, watching the falling snow. \"Think you've won, don't you?\" Potter started at the quiet, gravelly voice that came out of nowhere. He swiveled his head around to the source of the voice. Standing in the corner of the office was an older man, a bit short, with white hair. He was wearing an overcoat and a fedora. He had his hands in the pockets of his overcoat and his gaze was fixed on Potter. There was something about the stranger's gaze that un-nerved Potter…and that was something he was not used to. Potter called to his bodyguard, \"Frank! Frank! Help! There's an intruder in my office!\" \"He can't hear you, Henry\" said the little man, \"and you don't need him. I'm not going to hurt you.\" The man smiled a kind of a half-smile, \"Although after what you did to poor George, the thought had crossed my mind.\" He looked skyward, \"Yes, just for a second. Only being honest.\" Potter wasn't sure who this strange little man was talking to, but he was in no mood to find out. He yelled, \"I don't know what you want, but I'm telling you to leave, right this instant!\" The little man took a slow step away from the corner and cocked his head to one side. \"Oh, don't you worry, I'll leave…I don't like being in a room filled with as much greed and hatred as this place is.\" The man looked around the office and kind of shuddered a little. He then fixed his gaze back on the old man in the wheelchair, \"Henry, you did a despicable thing today when you stole that money from George Bailey's uncle.\" \"Steal it? Ha! I just saw it there on the counter and…,\" he chuckled a little, \"…tucked it away for 'safe keeping'\". Potter's face then turned into a snarl, \"It was misplaced! Bailey shouldn't have trusted that old fool! And what business is it of yours? You one of those ne'er-do wells he calls 'friends'?\" The little man in the overcoat removed his hat and fingered the brim like he was playing with it, \"My name is Clarence, and although I doubt it means anything to you, I guess you could say I am one of his friends.\" Clarence then looked up at Potter, this time with his eyes showing a hardness that belied his gentle appearance, \"Not that you'd know what a friend is.\" Potter looked at the man in disgust and fixed him with an icy stare. \"Friends? No one needs friends! A man stands alone on his accomplishments!\" Clarence raised an eyebrow, \"Spoken by a man who can't even stand.\" Potter glared at him. Clarence continued, \"You stole $8000 from a man who never did a thing to hurt you, then you made sure that the man you stole it from was going to jail so you could get him out of your way. No thought about the man's wife or his children. No thought to the people he helps out. No thought except how Henry F. Potter gets ahead.\" Clarence shook his head and looked just a little sad, \"How utterly, horribly selfish you are.\" Potter slammed his hands down on his desk, \"What business it that of yours?!\" The little man didn't flinch but instead bored his gaze into Potter all the more. \"Kindness towards others is everyone's business, Henry! You had a chance to spend your life and your wealth helping others. You could have been a benefactor to many, many people…yet you chose to live as a miser, acquiring more money than you could spend in a lifetime-and for what? You don't even have anyone to pass it along to.\" Clarence straightened himself a little and continued, \"Let me tell you what's going to happen to George Bailey. He's going to come home to his children and his loving wife. Those men will be there, like you said, but then something wonderful is going to happen. George's friends…yes, those people you describe as 'ne'er-do-wells'…are going to come to his aid. They're going to provide him with the help he needs to make up the difference of the money you stole. In fact, they're going to give him abundantly more than he could imagine . He won't be going to jail, and you will not have succeeded in wrongfully destroying a good man.\" Potter didn't answer the little man; he just stared at him with a sour expression. \"Let me ask you a question, Henry. Do you know the story of the rich man, found in the book of Luke, chapter 12?\" Potter grunted, \"The Bible? A bunch of old fairy tales for the weak-minded.\" Clarence gave a sad sigh, \"That's really too bad. If you'd read it, you'd know what's coming. Oh, well.\" The white-haired little man put his hat back on and turned to go. \"You can't say you weren't warned. Good day, Henry.\" Potter growled at the man as he reached for the door, \"Don't you ever come back in here again!\" \"Don't worry, Potter…I won't.\" Clarence turned his head toward Potter as he opened the door and said with a somber look on his face, \"Then again…neither will you.\" The little man closed the door behind him. Potter sat there, wondering what nonsense that strange little man meant. And how on earth did he get in there, anyway? It was just then that his bodyguard came back into the office. \"Frank…did you see that little old man that just came from my office?\" Frank looked puzzled. \"Mr. Potter, sir….I saw no one come in or out of your office. Are you alright?\" Potter had a look of confusion for a moment, but then it left. \"Humph…no matter. Time to go home.\" Potter's bodyguard came behind the wheelchair and pushed it out of the office, turning to lock the door. Later, at his home, Potter laid in his bed, wondering what the strange little man meant by what he said. He muttered, \"Crazy old coot\" and drifted off to sleep. Instead of dreams, he began to feel warm. VERY warm. ","Summary":" George Bailey ran up to the window of the bank.

By the time it turns into a shout, water's pouring through the fissures. The boy backpedals with his feet, feeling for solid ground on the disintegrating surface of the pond. There's nothing for him to grab onto, no foothold that stays stable. He slips and slides. Then the final crack of doom shatters the day, and he goes into the freezing water. \"Harry!\" the other boy, the older brother, shouts. Harry's clothes must be heavy with icy water, pulling him down with their woolen weight when he needs to push upward toward light and air. There is a moment when I could step from the trees, a kindly stranger, and extend a broken branch to Harry. He'd grab it, clutching with fingers he can barely feel, and I'd pull him to shore. There is a moment when I could step from the trees, a kindly stranger, and dive into the pond myself. I would kick myself deep, oblivious to the cold, and propel Harry to the surface. There is a moment when I could shout for help and someone would answer. Save George Bailey—that's the older brother—from the thing that will ruin his life. That's my charge as an angel.

I don't want to be done. The moment when I could help is ephemeral. It slides beyond the reach of my mittened fingers and snaps like an icicle as George Bailey dives into the pond to save his brother.

I used to get so frustrated with her because she would never see things my way. Sam Wainwright is a great person and has a good sense of humor but I just didn't see myself marrying someone wealthy. When we were younger I used to visit George all the time at his after school job at Gower's Drugstore. Mr. Gower always seemed so grouchy. George would always tell me that he wanted to see the world. I remember that day so well when Mr. Gower asked George to deliver those pills to Mrs. Blaine George sent a worried look in my direction as he ran out the door. I think he knew something was wrong and didn't know what to do. I noticed a piece of paper on the counter next to me and picked it up. It was a telegram addressed to Mr. Gower. My heart broke when I read it. It said his son had died from influenza. I went into the back room. \"Mr. Gower, sir.\" He looked up at me. \"What do you want little girl?\" \"I read the telegram sir. I know it isn't my business at all but I'm sorry about your son.\" \"Run along and go play with your friends little girl.\" I noticed two different containers of pills on the table. My eyes grew wide with fright. \"Mr. Gower, those pills you gave to George for Mrs. Blaine were the right ones weren't they? You had two different containers open.\" \" I said run along and play little girl. This isn't your business.\" I had a feeling that George was just as worried as I was about whatever was in that container. The day after the graduation dance I slept in until 10:00, I was woken up by the sound of the lawn mower. My brother Marty was outside mowing the lawn. I walked outside to the back porch. My mother was reading the paper in a lawn chair. \"Good morning sweetheart. You slept awfully late.\" I nodded. \"Yeah,It was a crazy last night that's for sure.\" \"Your brother was telling me how you and George won the Charleston contest. How Exciting.\" \"And wet,I don't think lots of people knew about that pool under the gym floor.\"I countered. \" Why did it take you so long to get home?\" \"We took the long way home past the old Granville house.\" \"Oh,really!\" \"I nodded. \"I told George I want to live there someday.\" My mother crinkled her nose. \"Of all the houses in town why choose that one? It's so run down and old. I am surprised it hasn't been condemned.\" \"I think it's a very romantic looking house.\" 'You don't think you're going to marry George Bailey, do you?\" \"George is a really sweet boy Mother.\" My mother snorted. \"And what's wrong with Sam Wainwright?\" \"Well, nothing really. I just picture my life better with George that's all. I want to be happy. I don't think having a lot of money is necessarily that important.\" \"Better is not living in the Old Granville House Mary. Stop being naïve.\" \"I don't see how it would be sensible to live with Sam Wainwright.\" \"I think Sam could provide much better than George could.\" \"I can't talk about this anymore Mother. I'm going inside to get some breakfast.\" As I was eating my breakfast my brother came inside from mowing the lawn to get a drink of water. He shot me a grin. \"You and George had fun last night didn't you?\" I smiled at him. \"Yes, we sure did. Mother doesn't really seem to get that I am not all that interested in dating Sam. It's very annoying.\" Marty rolled his eyes. \"I saw the way George was looking at you Mary. I think he's definitely got feelings for you.\" My eyes lit up. \"Do you really think so?\" My brother nodded his head. \"I do. Don't listen to anything Ma says. Sam probably isn't the type of guy you should date anyway.\" I gave my brother a kiss. \" Thanks Marty! I'm so glad we're on the same page about this.\" My brother was in my corner but my struggle with my mother couldn't be more real. It was even worse the night when Sam Wainwright called my house. I didn't even really want to talk to him… I just wanted to spend time with George since I hadn't seen him since before I left for school in August. I mostly took the phone call for Mother's sake so she would shut up about Sam and stop hounding me to get together with him. I missed Gorge very much while I was at school and I spent all my time when I wasn't ;t studying with or with Sam, Ange and all their friends thinking of him. We would always go to fancy restaurants where I could never afford anything. I was miserable. I phoned home to my mother after one such occasion. \"How are things going?\" \"Fine ma classes are good\" \"How is Sam?\" I sighed. \" He's good Mother. We out to dinner with some friends the other night.\" \"I hope he paid for you.\" I sighed again. \"Mama, I wasn't really happy that night at all. I'm really homesick\" \"Don't even tell me you miss George Bailey.\" \"Well ,of course I miss you Dad and Marty but yes I do really miss George too.\" \"When will it get through to you that Sam is the one I want you to marry?\" I had to bite my tongue and said nothing for a few minutes. \"Mary, sweetheart are you there?\" \"Yes Mama.\" \"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?\" \"Why can't you see things my way Mother? I want to be with George. Sam is a good friend but I don't think he cares about me. All he seems to care about is money and the stock market.\" \"He can provide for you quite well Mary. George Bailey won't be able to.\" \"Well how do you know that?\" \"His father and uncle have co-owned that Bailey Building and Loan for years… George works there now too… he didn't end up going to college. You two won't be able to make a living off that kind of salary.\" \"You might be surprised Mother.\" \"I highly doubt that Mary. When can you see that dream of living in the Old Granville house will never be a reality? Get that head of yours out of the clouds!\" I did not respond for ten minutes \" I wish you would stop being so stubborn and naïve Mary Jane Hatch!\" \"You are the one being stubborn Mother! You will never understand my feelings for George! NEVER! I am so done having this conversation with you! Goodbye!\" I slammed down the phone and threw myself down on my bed. Tears stung at my eyes. My brother was probably the only person besides me who knew George and I were meant to be together. And once again you see the struggle is real.

Happy Holidays fellow fanfiction writers. George Bailey just left in a huff. He was over here visiting Mary. When she told me she was here I was not the least bit pleased. His brother Harry graduated with Mary and I thought he was a bit of a wise guy. George seems to be a little bit less smart alecky than his brother but there's something about the Bailey family I never liked. I can't exactly pin point what it is. Sam Wainwright on the other hand is a much more classy fellow. He's the kind of person I want Mary to marry. I don't understand what exactly Mary sees in George Bailey but I am supposing there must be some sort of attraction. He returned 3 minutes later because he forgot his hat… a few seconds later Sam Wainwright's came through for Mary. I was happy that he called her tonight. She should have stayed in New York this weekend to spend time with him but she insisted on coming home. I didn't get to hear much of their conversation because Mary realized I was listening in but I do hope she'll fill me in later. 1 Week Later George and Mary are married. It came as quite the shock that he'd even propose to her. They haven't been dating… or maybe they have been and I just wasn't aware of it. I am not really disgusted, George is a sweet boy but I was really hoping that Mary would marry Sam Wainwright. I remembered why I don't like the Baileys while I was at the wedding. It's because of their financial status. They are not exactly poor but they are not rich either… Peter Bailey co—owned the Bailey Building and Loan with his brother in law Billy and I don't think they really make a lot of money there. At the wedding I was sitting next to my sister but I kept stealing glances at Mrs. Bailey, She looked very happy for George. Her tears were of pure joy. Mine were of aggravation. When Mary told me she was marrying George I told her to call off the wedding and that she should marry Sam once she is done with school. Apparently money must be no object to her. Love is love but I am not happy about this situation at all.

When rewatching it again this year, I really understood what Mary was feeling in this scene and decided to share it. It was all planned out. Exactly what was going to happen when George came to see her. He had to. His mother knew that she was home and Mary knew she'd insist upon his visiting her. It was inevitable. It was going to be perfect. George would enter and see her; \"Buffalo Gals\" would be playing; her sketch of him and the moon would be sitting out. He'd complement her on her skill and then remark how nice the music was—how much it reminded him of the last time they'd met, on the night of Harry's party. They'd sit together on the sofa and talk about the future. George would tell her how much he'd missed her and she'd tell him the same—how college really wasn't worth it if there wasn't someone like George there. He'd tell her how much he had dreamed of seeing her, she'd share her fantasies of him, and her mother would stop mentioning Sam Wainwright forever, because Mary had George and life was going to be perfect. She was only twenty-three; she was allowed to daydream every now and then. Then he'd kiss her. It was going to be marvelous. Mary Hatch stared down at the broken record and tried to convince herself that it was going to be alright. Sure he hadn't kissed her, or declared his love, or admitted he missed her, or even held a courteous conversation with her, but it was going to be alright, wasn't it? This couldn't be the end of the world, she attempted to tell herself, even as she knew that it was at least the end of her world. How many times had Sam Wainwright come to call on her and how many times had she turned him down? They could have been married by now, but no. She had to set her sights on George Bailey, one of the stubbornest men in Bedford Falls. Now look where she was. Sam was calling, but she didn't have any intention of returning his interest now or at any point in the near future. George may have stormed off, ruining what was supposed to have been their perfect evening, but that didn't mean she was going to settle for Sam. \"The phone!\" her mother insisted from the top of the stairs where she was clad in her bathrobe. \"Sam!\" Mary suppressed the urge to roll her eyes and follow George's lead. It didn't become a lady to behave in…well, such an unladylike fashion. \"Hello?\" The door swung back open and her heart skipped a beat. George was back. That had to mean that he had finally realized what she meant to him, and— \"Forgot my hat,\" he explained abruptly. It could be worse. He could have just left it, abandoning his hat in order to avoid her. Anyway, it couldn't hurt to see if he had any interest in her at all. Sam's phone call gave her the perfect opportunity. \"Well, hee-haw to you, Sam.\" He said something about how nice it was to hear her voice. She just focused on the man behind her, who appeared to be listening intently—probably her mother's doing. Really, what had the woman been thinking, making such comments about her relationship with Sam in front of George. \"How sweet of you, Sam.\" George seemed to have frozen in place. Then he turned and moved back toward the door. No! She was losing him! Luckily, Sam's comment about wanting to talk to him gave her the perfect opportunity to summon him back. Thank God for her mother eavesdropping on the extension, otherwise she wouldn't have had this perfect opportunity to stand so close to George. Later, she was vaguely able to recall that the conversation had had something to do with plastic factories. George also seemed somewhat distracted. She hoped it was because she was there and not that he was half-asleep or had some kind of medication that made him nod off halfway through a conversation. He kept hovering next to her, his nose faintly brushing her hair. She loved the sensation. She closed her eyes. If only… Sam's next words brought her back to reality. \"Mary, Mary, are you there?\" \"I'm here,\" she hurried, wanting Sam to hang up quickly so she could focus on George, but at the same time knowing if he did now, George would leave and the moment would be doomed never to be repeated. \"Tell him it's the chance of a lifetime.\" The voice echoed down the line. She looked up into George's eyes. So close… \"He says it's the chance of a lifetime.\" Instantly, his hands were gripping her upper arms and he was shaking her. The telephone crashed to the ground. He was shouting. Tears filled her eyes—not from the pain so much as the realization that this was the ending of her dreams. One way or another, this was a turning point and it didn't look favorable. He was going to yell and leave and never come back and— He kissed her. He kissed her face and held her tightly and she knew that everything was going to be alright. He felt something for her. Somehow, eventually, it was all going to be alright. They might never leave Bedford Falls and he might be working at the Building and Loan until one of their children took over, but it was going to be alright. She knew wishing on that old Granville house had been a good idea. With time, she might even get her wish. ","Summary":" A/N: This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie.

Their children were sleeping under the Christmas tree, having been up early and opened up all their presents early. George and Mary were sitting on the couch and enjoying the peace and quiet. \"George, I hope that you had a wonderful Christmas,\" Mary said, looking at her husband with a loving smile. \"It was. All I need is you and the children, love,\" he answered, kissing his wife with a coy smile. \"There is one more Christmas present that you have yet to receive,\" she told him. \"Oh? Where is it?\" Mary placed her hand over his and placed it over her belly. It took him a second to realize what she was doing. When he did, he gasped audibly. \"Mary? Truly?\" She smiled and nodded her head. He kissed her lovingly and longingly. He could not believe it. \"How far along are you?\" he asked her excitedly. \"About three months,\" she answered. \"Mary, this is the best Christmas I could ever ask for. I cannot wait to see our child when he or she is born.\"[Chapter 2] \"George! It's time!\" Mary exclaimed. George gathered the children and Mary and he rushed them all to the hospital in the car. He was so excited. The children were more so. Mary was rushed in the delivery room and George stayed in the waiting room with the children. He called his mother and Mary's mother and told them what was going on. Ever since the day that George married Mary, her mother was not his biggest fan. She still was holding on hope that Mary would change her mind and marry Sam Wainwright. George refused to let that to him. In his heart he knew that Mary would be his forever. Both of the mothers entered the hospital around twenty minutes after George called them. Mary's mother went into the delivery room to support her daughter in any way that she could. Two hours later, she came walking out and George stood up quickly, looking at her anxiously. Despite her feelings towards George, she smiled at him and said, \"You have a very healthy baby boy. You may see both mother and child now. They just finished cleaning everything up.\" George gave her a big hug. \"Thank you!\" he rushed into the room that Mary was in and stopped short when he saw Mary resting on the bed with a little bundle in her arms. She smiled wearily at her husband. \"We have a son.\" He walked slowly to the bed and kissed her on the forehead, careful not to jostle her too much. He looked at the babe in her arms and asked her if he could hold him. She passed him the babe. \"Why Mary, he has your eyes and mouth,\" he exclaimed in excitement. \"What do you think we should name him?\" she asked him. He looked at the babe closely and thought deeply. A noise interrupted his thoughts. It was a bell ringing. He smiled suddenly. His thoughts went back to Clearance. \"Mary, what about Clearance?\" \"I think that is a wonderful idea for a name,\" she agreed. \"Clearance.\" The babe started fusing. George gave him back to his mother.\"You should go out and tell the family what the child's name is,\" she smiled. He kissed her on the lips. \"Thank you Mary. You have given me the best years of my life.\" \"So you don't regret not going on the train and going on an adventure?\" she asked worriedly. \"For years I was jealous of my brother, being able to go to college and get a degree and wife; but then I might you again and all of those thoughts went out of my head.

He looked up but was caught off guard as she sent her fist into his face and fell to the floor unconscious, Sara dragged him over to a corner where she began to form a cocoon of alien DNA much like the one she had matured in Dean was soon wrapped in the cocoon which Sara connected to her herself by her tentacles and started to place her own genetic material inside.

Miranda's eyes were becoming heavier by the minute and she could barely stay awake. A yawn escaped from her mouth. Miranda felt really sleepy as the leather chair she was sitting in was really comfortable. Comfortable and big enough for her to litterally sink into, even though she was surrounded by many soft pillows which kept her from sinking too far into the chair. But since this chair was the only piece of furniture on which she could perfectly watch the television, she didn't have a choice but to use it and even though she'd fallen asleep in it many times before. After all, no one was there to watch her, so it didn't make any difference whether she took her uncle's favorite chair or not. However, this chair wasn't made for little girls like Miranda. Instead, it seemed to have been made for lazy grown-ups with a weight problem. With her short legs, Miranda could nearly reach the floor and with her thin frame, there was a lot of space left on either side of her. Enough space to stuff with soft pillows. Luckily for her, she could still reach the remote, which was lying next to her with a half empty bag of potato chips. And this chair was also big enough for someone to feel all cozy and quickly fall asleep in. Miranda could really feel this as she was about to fall asleep. Miranda really enjoyed these moments in which she could just do what she wanted without anyone punishing her for it. While her Uncle Tom and his student partner Forbes McGuire were off to the university, Miranda had all the time in the world to just relax and do nothing. Time she mostly spent by watching movies, walking around the house and, every once in a while, combing her long blonde hair, which reached her middle back and which she mostly did in the morning and afternoon. From the basement, where Uncle Tom's laboratory was, to the old and dusty attic, where she had even seen a mouse one day, she could get everywhere in the house she wanted to be. She felt like she was as free as a bird, and she liked this feeling a lot. After all, there was nothing able to stop her from taking the time to relax. That's why she enjoyed everything about it. However, there were also a few rules to which she must obey. Rules that were instructed to her by her Uncle Tom. According to him, little 12 year old girls like Miranda needed rules and there was nothing that could change his mind. And although she didn't always agree with those rules, she'd decided to follow them through anyway. Because what was the point in not obeying them? Exactly, nothing. Because if she decided to break those rules, she'd risk getting punished for her deeds, which was not something she wanted to enjoy. Actually, she didn't enjoy getting punished at all. So she was okay with following Uncle Tom's rules. The first rule her uncle had instructed her to follow was that she wasn't allowed to go out of the house. It was absolutely neccessary that she'd stay within the four walls of Uncle Tom's house. Even if there would be a fire within the house, it was still forbidden to even step one foot outside the house. She was to stay inside, whether it was sunny or raining, day or night. Even when Uncle Tom would be at home, she still wasn't allowed to leave the house. Miranda often wondered why she was told to obey this rule. Did she have some sort of virus or something? A virus so contagious that only Uncle Tom and Forbes were allowed to be with her? Maybe they were afraid that she'd spread this virus onto other people, which was understandable as she also didn't want to put all of humanity at risk by getting outside. Or maybe Uncle Tom was afraid that she wasn't able to blend in with the people on the streets, since he'd often told her that she was \"special\", whatever that meant. Whatever the reason, she wasn't allowed to put even one foot into the fresh air of the world outside their house. And even though she had many questions regarding this rule, she was okay with it. Because what was the point of going outside when she had all the things she needed inside the house? She really enjoyed everything the house had to offer, so she would be stupid to go outside and take her chances on missing out on all her favorite things inside. Hence the reason why she didn't have any problems with this rule. The second rule was that she wasn't allowed to touch even one thing inside Uncle Tom's lab, since he had always been very careful concerning his instruments and scientific research. It had even come to a point where he had secured the door to his lab with a lock, which could only be opened by a key that he always kept in his pocket. Why he'd done that, Miranda didn't know. But what she did know, was that her uncle was very suspicious of her entering his laboratory. Even Forbes sometimes wasn't allowed to touch anything within the lab, which was especially strange since Forbes was her uncle's pupil. Why this rule was this way, Miranda didn't know. But what she did know, was that Uncle Tom and Forbes had always been very mysterious and secretive about what was going on in there. They were always busy with research they didn't want Miranda to know anything about. But even though she was very curious to know what research they were doing in there, she know that she'd be in big trouble if she even touched one of Uncle Tom's instruments. So she just decided to always stay out of the laboratory, unless Uncle Tom wanted her to be there. And that was very, very often. The third and final rule was that she wasn't allowed to have any contact with other people besides Uncle Tom, who she was sharing this house with, and Forbes. This was probably also because she had some sort of virus within her. A virus so dangerous that one touch could infect you with it, she figured. Even if the doorbell would ring, Miranda was instructed to never open the door. And if someone other than Uncle Tom and Forbes were to come into the house, in some way or the other, she was ordered to go in hiding until that person would leave. She just couldn't have any contact with other people. That was the rule and she just needed to comply by it. Otherwise, she'd be in big trouble if she got caught. When Miranda had asked her uncle a while ago about the reasons for these rules, Uncle Tom had said that he just wanted to protect her from other people, who in his opinion mostly had bad intentions with little girls like Miranda. That was the only reason for these rules and there was nothing else to it, according to Uncle Tom. And of course she still had questions about these rules later on, such as why there are bad people in the world, but it always came down to her uncle's protectiveness of her. So she just accepted the reason why there were these rules and she agreed with her uncle that the only way for her, and maybe even humanity, to be safe is to obey by these rules. It had only been recently that Miranda had begun to ask herself where she'd come from. She had to come from somewhere, since she believed that she didn't just fall out of the sky, and she was just curious about where that 'somewhere' was. However, when she'd asked Uncle Tom about this, he didn't want to answer her question. As the reason why he kept his mouth shut about her origins was unknown to her, she kept asking her uncle about it. This was, until he got really angry at her a few days ago for pushing him to answer her questions when he didn't want to. And even though she'd stopped asking Uncle Tom about it since that incident, the questions about her origins still kept circling around in her head. After all, what was the big mystery that was surrounding her? That's what she wanted to find out. Her curiosity just needed to be satisfied. And the only way for that to happen, is if her uncle would just answer her questions. That was all he needed to do. Miranda was almost falling alseep in het uncle's comfy leather chair, despite the fact that she was watching some TV. The newsreporter on the screen was saying that a few weeks ago, a few highly secretive and medical samples had been stolen from a scientific military base just outside of Los Angeles. Apparantly, a team of soldiers and medical specialists were now searching for the samples, which were hard to find since they'd been stored in test tubes. However, Miranda wasn't that interested in the news on the TV, so she picked up the remote and shut off the television. After all, she felt nothing for science, so she just switched off the television as she was about to fall asleep. However, that's when she noticed it. After she'd laid down the remote, she suddenly noticed something off about her hand. Instead of the smooth skin she'd been having ever since she could even remember, there was now a small lump on the back of her hand. As she didn't remember bumping her hand against something, she began to wonder what is was. It wasn't like she'd injured her hand, so she was definitely curious about the sudden lump. The lump on her hand didn't look like a bruise or something, but instead looked like something that had crawled underneath her skin. Maybe it was a bug of some sorts, maybe it was something else. Whatever it was, the thought of a bug crawling underneath her skin made chills run down her spine. However, when the small lump began to grow, Miranda definitely knew that it wasn't some bug. It was something else and it scared her even more. This something seemed to be inside of her and it was now showing underneath her skin. It freaked her out as she didn't want to experience whatever was happening inside of her. She just felt like something scary, dangerous and painful was about to happen. She just knew it somehow. As she was wearing a short sleeved shirt, she saw that there were more lumps growing underneath the skin of her arms. She even felt lumps growing on her belly and legs and the rest of her body. This was definitely something serious and it started to really scare her. The lumps slowly began to hurt her from underneath her skin as it felt like her entire body was burning. She was slowly starting to feel the growing pain in her whole body as it seemed like the lumps continued to grow. It felt like something was trying to burst out of her skin as the pain slowly became worse and worse. Frightened and panicked, Miranda quickly got out of the leather chair and ran towards a big mirror, which was hanging next to a wooden bookcase. Looking in the mirror, Miranda saw that even her face was now covered with lumps that were growing bigger and bigger. The smooth skin she had a couple of minutes ago had been replaced by the most horrible sight she'd ever seen and she couldn't do anything against it. She just had to let it all happen, even though it hurt like hell. She was really scared and began to cry as the pain started to become unbearable, tears flowing out of her eyes and flowing down her cheeks. \"Help!\" Miranda began to cry, but no one could hear her. \"Oh my god, what's happening?\" Miranda cried out while she was feeling her face with her hand. That's when the skin on the back of her hand began to tear open and a brown/blackish slimy tentacle started to crawl out of it. It looked like something that certainly didn't belong in her body. No, it looked like something that was unknown to her. Something that seemed to belong in a horror movie and out of the ordinary. But it certainly still hurt like hell. Miranda began to step back from the mirror as she just didn't want to see herself this way. She had just become too scared and her face and body had become too ugly for her to even look at herself in the mirror. Slowly, other slimy tentacles were beginning to burst through the skin of her arms, legs, belly and other parts of her body. The pain was becoming worse and worse with every tentacle that burst out of her skin while Miranda began to scream and cry to the top of her lungs. Crying to her heart's content, Miranda saw that the tentacles were starting to grow. First they were only 1 inch, but they were quickly growing out to several inches. She also noticed that the tentacles didn't wrap themselves around her skin. Instead, the tips of the slimy things began to come loose from her body and started to climb up into the sky. Slowly, they began to climb towards the ceiling above her. Even the tentacles that were growing out of other places of her body were now growing from underneath her clothes and also started to climb towards the ceiling. Tears were quickly flowing down Miranda's cheeks as she saw all of this happening. After a while, the slimy tentacles reached the ceiling and started to attach themselves to the white panels. Her skin had been torn open, and now all of the tentacles that were coming out of her body were somehow slowly growing towards the white ceiling with some of them attaching themselves to it. Miranda just wanted all of this to stop as she cried her heart out. The pain, the slimy tentacles, her torn open skin, she just wanted to wish that this was all a bad nightmare. A nightmare where she could just wake up from. But instead, this wasn't some dream. This was real, and there wasn't a single thing to stop it all from happening. Slowly but surely, Miranda also began to lose consciousness as she saw all of this happen to herself, despite the fact that tears were still flowing out of her eyes. After all of the tentacles had attached themselves to the ceiling after a while, Miranda could just feel that they began to pull on her. But before she could feel them pulling her even futher, the world around her began to become darker and darker while her teary eyes slowly started to spiral into a total abyss. She had already been sleepy before, but she now felt like she could sleep for a lifetime. Her eyelids had become so heavy. This was not only because of the energy she'd needed to endure all of the horrible pain of the tentacles tearing through her skin, but also because she felt like her body forced her to sleep or something. However, she didn't want to sleep. No, she wanted to stay awake, whatever the costs. But whatever she tried to stay awake, whether she was fighting against the sleep or not, her body fought just as hard against it. And eventually, her body won, causing her to just let it be. She just let the sleepiness consume her mind, even though she initially didn't want to sleep. That's when all of a sudden, Miranda lost consciousness and she started to fall towards the floor, her limp body and mind losing all touch with reality. However, the tentacles stopped her fall, just before she'd hit the ground. Next, they all began to lift her unconscious and weak body towards the ceiling. Miranda didn't notice anything while this was going on. She just hung there limply as she got lifted up to the ceiling by the slimy brown tentacles as if she weighed nothing at all. After Miranda's limp body had been lifted up high enough, the tentacles that had come out of her body started to wrap themselves around her. Slowly but surely, the tentacles began to enclose Miranda entirely as they started to trap the little girl inside a little room. They began to engulf her inside a cocoon that was hanging from the ceiling and which was made from brown slimy tentacles. A little room just big enough to fit her entire body. Miranda was facing the ceiling above her and her legs were lifted up by the tentacles to touch the ceiling, so that she was now in a fetal position. Slowly but surely, a cocoon was formed around her and she was unable to escape out of it. And all the while she didn't notice anything. She was trapped in a room just big enough for her to fit in as slimy tentacles enclosed her entirely. As the world became darker and darker around her, she was slowly captured within a cocoon where she couldn't escape out of. As the tentacles were closing the last gaps in the cocoon, Miranda was entirely captured within a space that was barely big enough to fit her entirely. As she was now entirely closed within the cocoon, the maturing could begin. As she was hanging upside down inside her cocoon, Miranda slowly began to wake up. Slowly opening her eyes, she immediately noticed that she was in a small dark space. She felt constricted, like she was in some sort of bag or something. It was so dark, that she couldn't see anything. She could barely make out any light at all, since the space she was locked in was seemingly made of some dark rubbery skin-like material, through which the light barely shone. The space she was in was barely able to fit her as it was very small and the air inside the bag was almost non-existent, which made it very difficult for her to breathe. She figured that she needed to get out, and quickly too before she'd die out of shortage of air. Besides, being cramped up in such a tiny space wasn't really healthy in her opinion as it made it even more difficult to breathe. So she just needed to get out. In a few milliseconds, Miranda also noticed that she was entirely naked as her bare skin touched the inside of the bag. Somehow, she had been locked up in this bag without any clothes on. She wondered where her clothes were as she didn't feel really comfortable with being naked. After all, she didn't wear any clothes at all, which made her emberassed about herself. However, being naked made her feel a little less constricted, as clothes would just get in the way if she needed to escape out of this bag. It somehow even felt natural to be completely nude, strange as it may be. She just had to get used to herself being in the buff, even though it still felt awkward. After all, there were no clothes for her to put on and therefore she didn't have a choice but to be naked. However, what shocked Miranda the most was the fact that she'd grown bigger. Or at least, bigger than she was before. Normally, it'd take years to grow into what she guessed was an adult, so it was a big surprise for her to learn that she'd grown so quickly in what she guessed was a few hours time. But now she was suddenly a fully grown young woman, her entire naked body still slender and fit, but curved where she thought a grown-up woman should be curved, and big well-rounded breasts in a place where it was once flat and smooth. It certainly shocked her to be a big presence all of a sudden. However, as totally freaked out she was and as strange as it was for her to suddenly be a nude young woman, she had to accept her bare and grown-up body and make it a part of her. That was the only way to adjust to it. Her body had just grown to lengths that she hadn't even imagined before. And even though she was scared to adjust to being naked and this sudden change of her body, she just had to get used to it. She just had to get used to feeling comfortable in her own body again. Miranda had also noticed that she was entirely covered in slime, which made her entire naked body very slippery and gross feeling. In fact, the whole bag in which she was trapped inside of seemed to be filled with some sort of watery slime. Miranda felt like this slimy substance had come onto places of her body that felt really nasty, such as her lower area, her breasts and her face, which made it hard to breathe. Even her long blonde hair was completely soaked in slime as it stuck to her face, shoulders and the top of her back. However, even though the slime that covered her entire naked body was totally gross, it made her glad that she was completely nude, because the slimy substance inside the bag would only mess up her clothes if she had anything on her body. So she was glad to be completely derived of clothes. And even though the slimy stuff inside the bag felt really gross as her entire body was covered with it, Miranda became used to it. After all, she couldn't do anything about it. It actually felt nice since she could escape easier now that her entire body was as slippery as an eel. Miranda quickly felt the inside of the bag she was inside of with her bare back. As the bag she was in was very small and she was cramped up in there, she could easily feel the inside with almost every part of her body. And while she was doing this, the inside of the bag somehow felt like some sort of rubbery skin. But she was unable to see it as it was too dark. That's why she pushed her back further into it. But Miranda soon came to realise that the rubbery skin was very elastic and thick, which made escaping out of it seemingly more difficult to achieve. But still she had to do it, since there was almost no air and she couldn't hardly breathe and move. She just had to escape out of this bag, and very quickly too as she didn't want to be trapped forever. She just didn't want to die, so she had to escape immediately. But not only the shortage of air, but also her own nature told her that it was neccessary to hatch out of this bag. It somehow even felt natural for her to escape out of the tiny space she was in. Her body just told her to do it, so it definitely seemed neccessary to get out of the bag. Luckily for Miranda, the bag she was trapped in was very small, which made it easier to push her back against the inside of where she was trapped inside of. So she tried very hard to push her bare back through the thick layer of the bag. But the layer just wouldn't budge, so she tried even harder her best to break through it. She even tried to push her arms through the thick layer. She just had to hatch out of there, even if she had to die trying. She just wanted to get out of the bag in order to move freely, so she tried to push herself out of it with all of her strength. With all of her willpower, she tried her hardest to break through the thick layer and reach the outside world. Suddenly, Miranda felt like she had finally created a tear in the bag, the slimy substance slowly dripping out of it. Now it would only be a short time before she'd break out of the bag. But before that would happen, she must push her naked back even harder against the thick layer of the bag she was inside of. So she continued to try her mightiest best to hatch out of it. She clenched her teeth together as she definitely wanted to get out. She was fighting for her life as she was trying to hatch out of the bag. After a while, the moment was finally there. With her barenaked back, Miranda tore through the thick layer of the bag. Like a broken egg, the inner and outer layer of the bag were torn apart with a soft tearing sound. Finally, Miranda had created a tear in the bag big enough for her to slip through. Next, the weight of her nude and slippery body caused the tear to became bigger as its slimy contents began to fall out of it, just like egg white comes out of a broken egg. As she felt her body slipping through the tear, Miranda was glad that she'd finally reached her goal of getting out of the bag. Finally, a slimy and naked Miranda fell out of the small space and into the outside world. With an amazing speed, Miranda slipped through the tear she'd made and out of the bag, leaving it behind her. Like a slippery eel, a naked Miranda quickly made her way out of her confinement and immediately, she fell out of the bag towards the floor below it. In only seconds after leaving the bag behind her, Miranda collapsed onto the oak wooden floor with a heavy thud, her bare body absorbing the collapse of her fall onto the cold floor and the cold air quickly surrounding her entire exposed body. A large part of the slimy and watery substance inside the bag also streamed out of it and fell down. With an incredible speed, the slimy stuff fell after Miranda and came down on her body, splashing wildly on her naked skin. However, her skin was already slimy as it was, making the substance flow down her bare body easily like water. Immediately, Miranda began to shiver from the cold as she was now lying sideways on the floor. Inside the bag, it was all nice and warm. But now that she was out of it, the cold floor and the freezing air of the outside world started to engulf here entire nude body, which was still covered with slime and it was very cold. Her long blonde hair stuck to her face, shoulders and top of her back because it was very slimy, but she didn't care about it. After all, it'd dry up in time. Miranda also began to breathe heavily and gasp for air with her mouth open, as she almost hadn't gotten any air inside the bag. So she breathed the fresh air of the outside world in and out with gasps, like she hadn't gotten any in years. She could even feel her heartbeat going faster with the minute, pumping blood to every part of her body and thumping loud enough for her to hear. Her body really needed to adjust to the world outside the bag. While she was breathing heavily and lying sideways on the floor, a shivering Miranda decided to look around. Just like before she had been trapped inside the bag, she was still in Uncle Tom's living room. The bookcase with the mirror next to it was in front of her, just like before. She could now clearly see that she was a young woman now, every inch of her entire bare, well-toned and slender body covered with some sort of transparant slime. It felt strange to her that she was a woman all of a sudden as she witnessed how big and well-rounded her breasts and how smoothly curved her entire body had become. But even though she felt this way, she just had to get used to this body. That was the only way to feel comfortable in her own skin again. The only way to feel like herself again. However, what freaked Miranda out the most, was the thing that hung on the ceiling. The thing in which she woke up in. It looked like some sort of cocoon, made of tissue that looked like some sort of nervous system. Thick and broad nerves seemed to be wrapped around some sort of rubbery yellowish layer. It looked like something that seemed to come out of space as it didn't look like it originated from Earth. It also looked like a cocoon in which caterpillars grew into butterflies. It looked like something horrific. Horrific enough for her to figure out that she wasn't human. She was something else, but she didn't know what. What kind of monster was she? That's the question she wanted to know about the most. Miranda quite quickly figured out that she had matured inside the cocoon on the ceiling. She could even see the forms of her own adult and naked body protruding out of the tissue, like it had been made specifically for her bare form to fit inside it. Just like a caterpillar cocooned into a butterfly, she cocooned as a little girl and growed out into a young woman. It made her even more question what kind of creature she was. Was she even human anymore? Because humans don't grow up quickly inside a cocoon. At least, not the kind of people of who she heard of, such as her Uncle Tom and Forbes. No, she was something else entirely. Something that needed some sort of freaky cocoon to adult into, which confused and scared her the most. Miranda could still remember being a little girl, living in her uncle's house. She could still remember the lumps growing underneath the skin of her body and tentacles bursting out of her skin where the lumps used to be. She could also still remember the tentacles climbing up to the ceiling and attaching themselves to the white panels. She remembered crying to her heart's content while the tentacles were growing towards the ceiling. However, what came after that, she couldn't remember anymore, so she guessed that she'd been unconscious when the tentacles had lifted her up and formed a cocoon around her. Otherwise, she would've known how she got inside the cocoon. But now that she couldn't remember how she got inside the cocoon, she guessed that she must've been unconscious during the process. Apparently, she'd shredded her clothes when she had matured inside her cocoon. Otherwise, she wouldn't have woken up entirely naked inside the thing on the ceiling. And apparently, the torn up pieces of her clothes had completely evaporated inside the cocoon, because there were no pieces of fabric inside when she'd been inside of it. Or at least, she couldn't feel anything that felt like clothes when she was within the thing on the ceiling. That certainly explained the absence of her clothes to Miranda. She'd simply grown out of them when she'd matured into an adult, which wasn't something like she could've prevented. It was somehow only natural of her own nature that she was 'born' as a naked adult, so she didn't really mind it. She didn't mind it at all that she'd been naked inside the cocoon and that she was naked now as she was entirely covered in slime and lying on the cold floor. She was actually glad to be in the buff as she didn't mind being this exposed. It just felt somehow normal for her to be this way. Suddenly, Miranda heard the sound of a door opening and closing and she knew exactly who had come home. As she'd seen that it was already 5 o'clock, which happened to be the time Uncle Tom usually came home from his job at the university, Miranda guessed that this was also the case now. Apparently, Uncle Tom had come home and he was about to find his matured and naked niece on the ground. But she didn't mind. She just didn't mind if her uncle saw her this way. Instead, maybe it would be even better, because she had suddenly the anxious feeling like she wanted to have sex with him. Miranda was all of a sudden shocked and scared of her own thoughts. Was she really thinking about having sex with her uncle? Because even though she didn't want to have sex with him in a million years, as there was just no way she'd ever do it, her mind seemed to crave for it anyway. Her mind was somehow set on sleeping with her uncle. And with her mind, her body also began to crave for sex. And although it certainly sounded strange for her to make love to her uncle, she wanted to do it anyway. Her mind and body just demanded it of her, which made her like the idea. Slowly but surely, she began to crave for having sex with her uncle. She just had the sudden urge to do what she had on her mind and there was nothing and nobody that could stop her. It was just her and her uncle. The perfect opportunity. As she was lying with her bare back towards the living room door, Miranda couldn't see when it was about to be opened by her uncle. She just had to wait for him to enter the living room and see her lying on the floor. However, she didn't have to wait for too long as she heard the door being opened, which was followed by a gasp as Uncle Tom probably saw her naked slime-covered body lying on the floor. \"Oh my god\", Miranda heard her shocked uncle say. Miranda didn't feel like turning over to see her uncle as she just wanted to rest after hatching out of the cocoon. It had taken so much energy from her that she just didn't have the strength to do anything. She just had to rely on every sense but her sight. That was the only way for her to know what was going on behind her back. The next thing Miranda heard, were footsteps coming towards her. Her uncle seemed to be making his way towards her, which was exactly what she wanted. Now she had the chance to make love to him. The chance to have sex with him and satisfy her craving. And although the idea still sounded strange to her, it felt like her mind and body had begun to force herself to do it anyway. Having sex was all that she wanted and now she had a good chance to achieve this. She just wanted to have sex so badly. She just needed it to survive somehow. Tom Hollander was amazed, shocked and confused at the same time. The moment he saw his naked and matured niece lying on the floor and under something that looked like a cocoon, he knew something had seriously changed. Not only was his niece suddenly a fully grown and young woman, but she also seemed to have done this maturing inside the cocoon on the ceiling, which in his opinion looked horrifying. Forbes had already told him that it'd be in his niece's nature to grow into an adult like this, but he'd never actually seen it. So it was definitely a shocking surprise to see and learn that it had actually happened the way Forbes had told him. Miranda had actually created a cocoon around herself to mature into and now his niece, who was only a 13 year old this morning, had become a woman with everything that came with it. From her breasts to her slender and curved body, everything seemed exactly right for a young female. He doubted if the maturing of his niece was a miracle of something monstrous. After all, she was an alien with the strong nature to mate and procreate with every man on earth, which had matured into something that seemed to belong in a horror movie. Or so Forbes had informed him. So he didn't know whether or not he should be happy with this as she could also form a sexual threat to himself. After all, he was a man. And a man was everything Miranda needed to create offspring. However, what Miranda needed now, was something to cover herself with as she was completely derived of clothes. Tom quickly took off his coat. He wouldn't just let his niece be naked and exposed this way, even though she could be a sexual threat to him. Not when he could do anything about her nudity. So he quickly took off his coat and brought it towards Miranda. Next, he laid the piece of clothing over most of her slimy naked body, covering her nudity. He noticed that Miranda wasn't entirely comfortable about this as she hissed at the sudden touch of the fabric, but it needed to be done. He wouldn't just let his niece walk around in the buff. There was just no way he'd ever allow that to happen, even though she didn't seem to like it. After he'd laid the coat over Miranda, Tom quickly crouched down next to her prone form. He'd already figured that his niece had matured inside the cocoon on the ceiling, but he didn't care about it. He didn't care about the cocoon in the room. He'd clean that up later. Right now, his main priority was his niece. Like it had always been. As he watched her, he saw that every inch of her naked body that stuck out of his coat, such as her shoulders, arms, head and her legs, seemed to be covered in some sort of transparent slimy substance. Even her long blonde hair was slimy and wet, as if she'd just come from a shower. However, he didn't care about it as Miranda was the most important person in his life and not some sort of slime in which she was covered in. As he crouched down next to her, Miranda eyes shot up to his face. Eyes that told him that she wanted something from him. But he'd figure that out later. Right now, his main concern was finding out what happened to his niece. The last time she'd seen her, she was just a little girl. And now she was suddenly a fully grown woman, which made him very curious about what happened to her. Of course he had Forbes' information about her, but he just needed her to tell him if Forbes was right. Only then, they'd be able to research this occurence. But this was also a moment to comfort his niece, since they'd always been very close. \"Miranda, what happened?\" Tom asked her. But Miranda already knew what had happened to her. But she didn't want to tell her uncle about it. Instead, she wanted something else. She wanted to have sex with him. And that was exactly what she was planning to do. And unless something would interrupt her, there wasn't a chance in hell that she didn't want to do it. So she just looked at Uncle Tom silently, because she already knew what happened. Something incredible happened to her. Absolutely something incredible. Author's note: Well, this was my story about Miranda before and after she has matured inside a cocoon. And in case you haven't watched the fourth movie yet, Tom has found a way to suppress Miranda's alien side, so that she doesn't want to have sex with him anymore. I know that I've written her thoughts at the end of this story a little awkwardly, but that's just the way the aliens in the Species-quadrilogy think and operate. They're out to mate with the human race, and there's almost no one who can stop them. So what do you think of my story? I wanted to describe the events that lead to and from Miranda's cocooning stage from her point of view. So I hope that you've enjoyed this one shot.

After all, who wouldn't be disturbed by the thought that someone wasted 10 minutes of their life writing this?! Nonetheless, I hope it tickles your funny bone and makes you grin! -------------------- Patrick Ross sleepily got out of bed and stretched. \"Ah, another day, another B-movie style 'death-by-sex' for some lucky girl!\" he yawned. He got dressed and was about to brush his teeth, when the sound of someone knocking at the door stopped him. \"I wonder who that could be?\" he wondered. When he opened the door, he was shocked (in a good way) by what he saw: it was a beautiful young blonde in a mailgirl uniform! \" Time to pour on the old charm! \" he thought as he slicked back his hair. \"Here's your mail, Mister!\" she said with a smile. \"Thanks...\" he smiled back. \"You're not the typical postal service type; you're quite a bit cuter! Tell me a little bit about yourself.\" \"My name is Lisa Meesa. Actually, I'm a nurse-in-training,\" she replied with a blush. \"But for some reason, I flunked out of medical school. I'm just doing this until I can get back in. Say, do you want to (#$?!)?\" Patrick's eyes went wide. \"Excuse me?!\" \"Well, you're Patrick Ross, the escaped astronaut-turned-reproduction-obsessed-alien, right? The one who keeps fatally impregnating all of the girls you meet?\" she asked, unconcerned. \"H-how did you know that?!\" he gasped. She handed him a letter addressed \"To the sex-starved alien\". \"Oh...\" he mumbled. \"I hear you've got things going for you!\" she said with a giggle. \"Let's get it on!\" Patrick raised an eyebrow. \"And... you're cool with the whole 'fatal pregnancy' thing?\" \"Oh, don't worry!\" she assured him. \"It won't be fatal for me. To tell the truth, I've kind of been planning this for a while, so I've eaten nothing but bubble gum for the last week. That way, when the time comes, by belly will stretch, but not pop! Then I'll just digest the little bugger!\" \" I'm starting to understand why she failed medical school... \" he thought, mortified. \" Oh, well. What she doesn't know won't hurt me! \" \"Well, what you've heard is true!\" he bragged. \"I DO have things going for me, and you seem to have things going for you, so... Shall we?\" \"Sure!\" she said with a giggle. She walked inside, and Patrick closed the door. What happens next is strictly censored, but I can tell you that it took place on Patrick's bed, involved the fondling of back tentacles and mammary glands, and could generally be described as \"wild monkey-love\", among other things... \"Whew!\" sighed Patrick happily as he lay on the bed next to Lisa. \"That was great!\" \"You said it!\" she whispered. \"You really are 'out of this world', at least in certain spots... Hey, when does that whole 'instant-baby' stuff start, anyway?\" \"Oh, I don't know...\" he replied thoughtfully. \"Generally it takes about five minutes.\" \"Five minutes, huh? I--OH!\" Lisa sat straight up in the bed. \"What? Already?!\" Patrick exclaimed. \"No!\" she said. \"I...I need some strawberry ice cream and sourkraut!\" \"Wha-what?\" Patrick asked, freaking out. \"You heard me!\" she yelled at him. \"Me--have-craving; you--grocery store--go--NOW!\" Lisa hit him with a nearby newspaper, forcing Patrick out of bed. Quickly getting dressed (and grumbling all the way), he hurried to the nearest supermarket, bought the bizarre mixture of foods, and hurried back in a record 2 minutes. Opening the door, he tiredly muttered, \"Okay, I've got the ice cream and sourkraut.\" \"Oh, that. I don't want it anymore!\" Lisa said with a sweet little smile. \"WHAT?!\" he erupted. \"I almost broke my neck retrieving that disgusting junk!\" \"Why are you yelling at me?! Waaaaaaaaaaaah!\" she broke into tears. \"I--I'm sorry, I...\" he stammered, embarassed. Suddenly, she looked up, murder in her eyes. \"SORRY?! Sorry isn't good enough! \" With that, she grabbed a nearby lamp and threw it at him. \"Ack!\" Patrick yelped, barely dodging. \"What was that for?\" \"Nothing, my dear, sweet baboo!\" she bubbled happily. \" Aha. Mood swings. Figures! \" thought Patrick, exasperated. \"My lovely Adonis, please, come kiss me!\" Lisa said, striking up a seductive pose. \"Oh, baby! Now you're talking my language!\" Patrick grinned ear-to-ear. He ran over to the bed, hopped back in, and put his lips next to hers... \" BLLLLUUUGHH! BLAAGGHH! BARF! BARF! PUKE! \" There were a few bubbles in the puke-pool on the left side of the bed, and then Patrick burst out, gasping for air! \"Oops!\" Lisa whispered, embarassed. \"Morning sickness. Sorry about that!\" \"It's...okay,\" he mumbled, wiping the slime off of his face. \" How can one woman hold that much stomach acid?! Oh well... \" he thought miserably. \"Say!\" Lisa suddenly brightened. \"I think I felt something!\" \"Really?\" Patrick said hopefully. (\" Maybe she'll die and this will be over with... \") Lisa lifted up the covers, but Patrick was surprised (and slightly disappointed) to see that her stomach was just as flat as it had always been. \"Are you sure about feeling something?\" he asked skeptically. \"Mmm-hmm,\" she replied, nodding. \"Just feel for yourself.\" Curious, he leaned his cheek onto her belly. Just then, her stomach lurched forward with such violence that it knocked Patrick into the air and out of the bed! He crawled to his feet, now sporting a black eye and missing a few teeth. Lisa was now standing up on the bed, getting knocked back and forth like a rag doll. \"What the heck is going on in there? A prize fight?!\" he moaned, rubbing his swollen cheek. \"I--oof!--think this might--yow!--be 9 month's worth--ouch!--of kicking!\" she groaned, bouncing back and forth. Finally, the little fetus quit its hopping around, and Lisa fell to the bed exhausted. \"Huff! Huff! Wow! That was a trip!\" she wheezed. \"How much longer, d'ya think?\" Patrick looked at his watch. \"Let's see... any moment now.\" \"This had better not hurt or anything! I've been through a lot because of you,\" Lisa pouted. \"I'd better receive my child-support check, too!\" \"What?!\" Patrick shouted angrily. \" You've been through a lot? What about me?!\" \"You've had it soft! I hardly asked for anything, and didn't cause any trouble!\" she replied curtly. Patrick was about to respond, when Lisa gave a little yelp. Watching with fascination (Patrick wasn't surprised; this was \"old hat\" for him), Lisa's eyes widened with shock as her stomach began to enlarge at an inhuman pace. \"Hey, Patrick!\" she said, a little nervous. \"My stomach is stretching, all right, but it's kind of a tight fit. What happens if I run out of room?\" Her bulging gut was now easily at the 9-months size, and showed no sign of stopping! Lisa screamed in pain as her stomach exploded in a surge of blood and fluid! Within seconds, she was dead. Patrick let out a sigh of relief. \" That happens.\" He walked over, picked the alien-baby out of her belly, and walked out the door. As he was leaving, he muttered, \"I tell ya, 5 minutes is way too long!\" THE END ---------------------------------------- Well, that's it. This was just a stupid idea I came up with one day, and I figured that I might as well write it down. No offense is meant to pregnant women; I'll bet you ladies would get more of a kick out of this than most! Besides, I've been told I came from one. Hahaha!

My dad hates me. He always has. Well, maybe not before Mom died, but after hearing him tell Kelly that I have Mom's eyes, and that I remind him of her, I'm positive he hates me. He screamed at me no less than twenty minutes ago. A loving father, a real father would have tried to help me. I always knew he was incredibly selfish. \" Help me, help me!\" Help me. That's all he ever says. Dad always loved Rosie more. Probably because she has Mom's spirit. He never asks if I'm okay, never cared that I might be suffering. The disappointment in his eyes whenever I got into trouble was always enough to tell me that he didn't care why I did it, only that I was stupid enough to do it. Never asked me what motivations I had, or what I had gone through in order to do it. And then I got expelled, and he decides to move to a zoo! He did it because of Rosie. Once again playing favorites. \" Rosie loves it.\" those were his exact words. You know, I bet he's never even cared enough about me to even look at my artwork. If he has, then he didn't care. Only decided to leave me to my own devices. Well, I'm done. Being around people has only hurt me. I'm leaving tonight. I get up off my bed, where I've laid since Dad showed that he only cared about Rosie, and Kelly. I pack my clothes into the duffel bag that Mom gave me for my tenth birthday. I throw in my art journal and another few notebooks, and pack all of my jackets. I change into some sweats that I haven't worn since Mom died, and pull on m warmest coat and tennis shoes. I look around my bare room one last time, and decide to take the stuffed tiger Rosie gave me when we moved here. I pack everything that reminds me of mom, Rosie, and Lily. The little note of sunshine has been the only thing keeping me here. She'll be devastated, but I have her phone number. I can keep in touch. I stuff my wallet into my pocket and shoulder my backpack. I glance around one last time, then check my watch. Eleven o'clock. Dad will be in bed now. I pick up my duffel bag, and open the door softly. Everything is silent. I can hear Rosie's soft snores from where I stand. I only feel numb and cold. No remorse, no regret. I am better off without my alienating father and my innocent little sister. I tiptoe down the hall, then think of something. I go back to my room, and pull out a scrap of paper and a pen. I wrote a note to Lily. Lily, I just want you to know I'm sorry for everything I did to you. I hope you know nothing was your fault. You are the most beautiful, amazing girl I've ever met. I want you to know I love you. ~Dylan There. Perfect. The only one I care about will at least know I love her. I replace my pen into my backpack and leave my room for what I'm almost positive will be the last time. I listen to Rosie's breathing, then decide to take a piece of her with me. I pull out my phone and record ten seconds of her snores. She loved me, and it is only now that I feel a sliver of regret to leave her. I quickly push it away and tiptoe down the stairs and out the front door. Padding across the lawn, I look around at the zoo. I go visit Spar one last time, and give him a whispered, \"Good luck.\" I run by Lily's dwelling and slip the note in through her window, where it lands on her dresser. I turn and walk down the road, feeling like a hobo. Finally, I give one last glance at the farm, and my gaze lingers longingly on Lily's place. I turn and leave the property, not looking back. I may come and visit Lily and Rosie someday, but I am glad to finally leave behind my miserable life with my father. Good-bye, Rosemoor.

Oh sure, I'd always loved animals and taking care of them, but I had never known how much more I would love it. Now I had the problem of actually finding a position. All I wanted to be was a Zookeeper...and not just a zookeeper but a zookeeper in one of those zoos where the animals have more room and are happier. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any such positions. But I didn't want any other zookeeper position, so I decided to get a job as a groom at a stables until I did find the perfect position. I knew there was no such thing as a perfect job, but I wanted one as close to perfect as possible. And that's when I heard about the zoo. A failing zoo with every mind to shut their doors and the man that came and brought it back to full speed. She was amazed. She was astonished. She was excited. She had to get a job at this zoo. It wasn't your ordinary zoo. It focused on the values she focused on. Health and happiness of the animals, as well as the enjoyment of the visitors. Benjamin Mee sounded like an excellent boss to have. She had to get a position here, she simply HAD to. She would even be happy with one not even related to the animals as long as it got her there. Even if she got in the lowest position, she could work her way up to where she wanted to be. And so when the zoo advertised, she almost didn't read the ad before picking up the phone. But, she decided she'd better know what she was doing before she called to make an interview. 'Wanted, a full-time assistant animal caretaker. Report to Dartmoor Zoo headquarters to be interviewed and assessed by Kelly Foster. Must be strong, reliable, have experience working with animals and be calm-tempered.' \"That's me!\" I thought excitedly. I dialed the number attached to the ad and waited for an answer. I could just imagine it now...Jennifer Williams, head of animal maintenance and care. My dream job. I didn't really want to own a zoo...just be the head of animal care. Still, I could work my way up from assistant animal caretaker. I was lucky to get even that position. \"Hello, this is Dartmoor Zoo, Rhonda speaking.\" \"Hello, I am calling about your ad for an assistant animal caretaker. I would like to set up an interview.\" \"Of course. What is your name?\" \"Jennifer Williams.\" \"Age?\" \"Nineteen years.\" \"And do you meet all the requirements listed on the ad?\" \"I believe so.\" \"When can you come over?\" \"Anytime during the weekend.\" \"Alright Miss Williams, would a five-o-clock p.m. meeting work for this Saturday?\" \"That sounds perfect.\" \"Alright. We look forward to meeting you. Goodbye.\" \"Thank you, goodbye!\" I put the phone down, exited for the interview. This was my chance to prove myself and I had to prepare. But first, I had to get a good night's sleep. If that was even possible. The zoo was out of town and in the woods. It was a beautiful drive and I had an easy go of parking, since the park was technically closed. I looked around and wondered where I should go. Finally, I decided to go to the ticket office to see if anyone was still there. Maybe I'd find Rhonda, whom I'd talked to over the phone. But, no one was in the office and I couldn't get in. I felt stupid at not asking where I was to meet Kelly Foster. Finally, I just took the little path leading from the office, hoping it would lead somewhere useful. As I walked, I heard squawking down a different path. I knew that squawking...it was parrots. I absolutely loved parrots, so I quickly went to see them. And sure enough, there they were. Bright colors and playful chattering. I couldn't help staying there a while to admire them. When I looked at my watch, it was nearly five, so I quickly said goodbye to the birds and ran back to the path, then started running on the path. When I rounded a corner, I full-on crashed into someone, causing me almost to fall. I looked up to see a man looking at me in a concerned manner. \"Are you alright? I'm sorry.\" \"Oh, no, I'm okay, are you okay? I wasn't really watching where I was going.\" He smiled softly. \"What are you doing here? The zoo's closed.\" \"I know, but I'm due for a meeting with Kelly Foster about the open position, and I am looking for her. I forgot to ask where I was to meet her. Well...I mean, the woman on the phone said headquarters but I don't know where that is.\" He smiled again. \"Let me show you. I was just going home, but I can take you there before I do.\" \"Oh thank you so much.\" I ran a hand through my hair and followed him. He was a good-looking man, with hair the same shade of brown as mine and dark brown eyes. He had stubble on and I wondered if he'd had a hard day or if he just always let stubble grow. On his shoulder I noticed for the first time a Capuchin monkey. I smiled. Monkeys were another favorite of mine. \"Excuse me, but is that monkey yours?\" He glanced at me. \"She was the zoo's, but I am her sole caretaker so she's kind of become mine, in a way.\" I nodded. \"I understand. That's cool. What's her name?\" \"Crystal.\" \"Cool. And what's your name?\" \"Robin Jones, at your service.\" I laughed. \"You're proving that right now. I am Jennifer Williams.\" He nodded. \"You like animals?\" \"Love them. Always have. This job is just what I wanted, so wish me luck.\" \"If you truly love them as much as you say you do, then good luck.\" I smiled again. \"What's your favorite animal? Besides monkeys, that is.\" \"I love lemurs as well.\" \"Oh, lemurs are the coolest things ever. I love parrots and big cats myself, but I've always had a soft spot for monkeys and lemurs, too.\" \"Parrots are cool, especially ours.\" \"Yes, I took a look at them. Very beautiful. I really want to interact more with them.\" \"Here we are.\" he said, and motioned to a building. \"Inside, just go through the main area to the opposite door. The main area is where we hang out usually, but tonight everyone wanted to go home. Long day, you know.\" \"I understand. Thank you, Mr. Jones.\" He smiled and nodded, and I went inside.

The Zoo had been going great for the last month, Dylan hasn't gotten in trouble in his new school at all, and Rosie was doing great in her new school. He made his way to the new exhibit they were opening up and looked up at the sky. The tempature had been record breaking for the last two days, with a tempatre of 102 for both days, and today was 103. He smiled as he saw Dylan and Lily bringing over planks of wood for the exhibit. He was glad that his son was happy with her and he hoped that niether of them broke the other ones heart. He greeted the two and Lily gave him a smiled and wave and Dylan gave him a half smile. He continued walking and looked for anything wrong with the exhibits or animals. He nodded at Peter as he walked past him. Benjamin stopped him, \"Hey you seen Kelly anywhere?\" he asked, and Peter nodded. \"I saw her at the lions.\" he said, and Benjamin nodded. \"Thanks.\" he said, and headed towards the lions. Kelly had moved out of her mothers house and into her own apartment along with Lily. He and Kelly as a couple had been doing great, even though they hadn't been on a offical first date. The lion encolser came into view and he could make out Kelly leaning up against the ledge watching them. Benjamin smiled and walked up beside her, \"Good afternoon beautiful.\" he said.

You can't go that long without water, its blazing hot out here.\" he said. \"I'm fine, I just need to take a rest.\" She said, begining to walk away from the lions and him. He grabbed her arm to stop her, and she turned and looked at him. \"Come on Kelly, how about you go into the house and lay down on the couch for a bit? Get some water and take some asprin.\" he said. \"I'm fine Benjamin, what I need to do is go and help Lily and Dylan with the new exhibit.\" she said. She tried to pull away but he wouldn't budge. \"Please Kelly.\" he said. She sighed, knowing she wouldn't get her way. \"Fine.\" He smiled and moved his hand down from her upper arm and laced his fingers with hers. She smiled at him as they began to walk towards the house. They walked past Lily and Dylan who were finishing up their days work. They smiled at Kelly and Benjamin who smiled back. They walked into the house and Benjamin guided her to the couch and sat her down, \"I'll be right back.\" he said. He went in the kitchen and got her a bottle of water and asprin and when he returned he found Kelly already laying on the couch half asleep. He smiled to himself, he was right, she was sick. He sat the water and asprin on the table in front of the couch and walked out, leaving Kelly to sleep in peace. He walked to where Lily and Dylan were, \"hey guys.\" he said. \"Hey dad, wheres Kelly?\" he asked his father. \"She went to lay down cause she was dehydrated. You guys okay? Its really hot out here and I don't want you guys to over work yourselves.\" he said. \"Were fine , thanks though.\" answered Lily. He nodded and looked at Dylan, \"You seen your sister anywhere?\" he asked, and he shook his head. \"No I've been here with lily all day.\" he said, smiling at his girlfriend. Benjamin smiled and went to look for his youngest. Three hours later he and Rosie walked into the house to find Kelly still asleep on the couch, \"She we wake her up?\" asked Rosie. \"I think we should let her sleep.\" said Benjamin, and then an Idea popped into his head, \"What do you think of camping out with Lily and Dylan?\" he asked. \"Yeah!\" \"Well lets go and see what Lily and Dylan say about that.\" he said, and they went out to the garage where Dyaln and Lily where they were counting out amounts of feed for the animals. \"Hey guys!\" said Rosie. \"Hi Rosie.\" said Lily. \"So what do you guys think about camping out in the Zoo tonight?\" said Benjamin. \"Where's Kelly? Don't I have to go home with her?\" asked Lily. \"She's still sleeping in the house, I'm just gonna let her sleep so I thought you guys could camp out while me and her sleep in the house.\" he said. \"Okay! Sounds fun! Right Dylan?\" Said Lily, and he nodded. \"Yeah, fun...\" he said. Rosie smiled and grabbed her fathers hand, \"Come on lets go set up the tent!\" she said, and dragged her dad out of the garage. Lily looked at Dylan and smiled, \"Isn't it sweet?\" said Lily, and Dylan gave her a confused look. \"What your dad is doing for Kelly. You know letting her sleep while she's sick and keeping her here over, and getting us out of the house while he sleeps there with her. I bet he's gonna end up laying down and falling asleep with her.\" she said. \"Ten bucks says he's gonna end up taking her upstairs in his bed.\" \"Deal.\" he said. They made their way around the Zoo looking for Bejamin and Rosie, and they found them by the lions. \"Cool, I've always wanted to sleep with the lions.\" said Lily. \"So I brought out a bunch of pillows and blankets for you guys and Rosie brought out snacks and flashlights.\" said Benjamin. Lily smiled and looked at Dylan who smiled back, and Rosie was grinning from ear to ear. \"Well come on!\" said Lily getting in the tent. They all climbed into the tent and once they were in Benjamin made his way back to the house. He quietly opened the door and shut it and walked into the living room where Kelly was sleeping. He smiled to himself when he realized just how luky he was. Ever since his wife died he had hoped he would have a second chance, he knew she would want him too. When he first bought the Zoo and met Kelly he wouldn't have believed that they would be here right now. There wasnt a day that goes by he doesnt think of his wife, but he knew he should find love again, that he should be happy. He walked over to the couch and looked at kelly. He bent down and slid his arms under her and picked her up. Hse stirred a bit but didn't wake, which he was grateful for. he walked up the stairs and into his room and over to his bed where he laid her down. She stirred a bit and her eyes fluttered open \"Benjamin..\" she mumbled. \"Just go back to sleep Kelly.\" he said. \"Wheres...Lily..?\" she muttered. \"She Rosie and Dylan are camped out outside, she fine. Now go back to sleep. I'll be here when you wake up.\" he said. She muttered something and closed her eyes again. Benjamin smiled and quickle changed into a pair of pajama pants and a t shirt before crawling into bed with her. She immediatly rolled over and into his arms as if she knew he was there. Benjamin was a bit taken back when rolled rolled into him. He hadn't held another woman in his arms ever since his wife died, and it was...strange in way, but he liked it. He slid his arms around her waist and pulled her into him, and she responded by snuggling into him. He smiled as his eyes began to flutter close. He was happy, his son was happy and Rosie was happy. The world was right again. A/n: So I noticed there wern't and Bejamin/Kelly stories so I decided to write one! Well there will be Dylan/Lily in here to. So review and I'll add the next chapter!

Or break it, even better. The sun leaked through the curtains across the room, and I thanked God that it wasn't raining again. It was Saturday, which meant I would be feeding the animals and cleaning the store room as best as I could. I lay staring at the ceiling for a good five minutes, pondering how I would go about today. Somehow, I couldn't think about one thing without that one annoying thing popping up into my head. Dylan. His eyes, his hair, his smile. I mentally slapped myself for my stupid childish behaviour. He didn't need me, did he? He had that other girl anyway. What was her name? Anna? Lana? Annie? I had forgotten already. I hated her. I had tried to get along with her, for Dylan's sake, but that turned out to be impossible. She was covered in makeup and was all in all, a big fake. Her tacky bleach blonde hair was always scraped up into a messy bun, and she wore all those branded clothes I didn't even know the names of. I really didn't know what Dylan saw in her, until I found out she 'liked' art as well. It wasn't fair. I made my way to the bathroom; where I hopped in and out of the shower in about 10 minutes, and took another 10 minutes to blow dry my hair. I opted for some pale skinny jeans, a plain white t shirt and a big grey hoodie. I decided to, since I was going out straight away, I wouldn't bother with makeup. I left my long blonde waves down, even though it would probably not stay nice if it rained. I ran down the wooden stairs two at a time, and almost crashed into Kelly, who was in the process of pulling on her boots. \"Hey, Kelly\" I said, pausing to put on my boots. \"Hey Lil, where you off to?\" She asked, finishing the knot in her laces. \"Oh, Dylan said I could come over this morning, because we're doing the store room together\" I sighed, wondering if she would be there. \"No breakfast?\" She said, gesturing to the bowl of fruit on the counter. \"I'll have something there, don't worry\" I said, tying my laces. \"Well, make sure you do, Lil. Most important meal of the day.\" Kelly exclaimed, as I opened the door and walked out, waving over my shoulder. I sprinted down the path into the park, and soon enough was at the Mee's front door. I adjusted my hair slightly, though there was no point, and knocked on the door. I waited for a few seconds, and then the door swung open to reveal a very shirtless Dylan. I tried not to get all flustered, but as a 16 year old girl it was hard not to. \"Lily, hey!\" He said, waiting for me to say something. \"The store cupboard…?\" I tried to remind him, as a look of confusion passed over his face, then suddenly a look of realisation. \"Oh yeah, well come in for a few minutes while I find a shirt.\" He said, turning to go up the stairs. I smiled, and wandered into the kitchen, and was almost tackled by Rosie. \"Hey! Watch where you're going, kiddo\" I laughed, and she nodded and continued to run off. I walked into the kitchen, my stomach grumbling. Dylan always had said I could help myself to breakfast, so why not? I thought, and eyed the cereal boxes on the counter. I was about to help myself to some, when a high pitched 'ahem' came from behind me. I spun around, only to see none other than Annie herself. I was pretty sure that was her name. She was clad in her usual tacky clothes, short shorts and handbags. She had a plate of untouched toast in front of her. She was extremely thin, but maybe that's what Dylan liked. Maybe. Probably. I rolled my eyes, making no effort to engage in conversation. She just went about her business, scrolling down her smart phone. I was about to go back to making myself some cereal, when that little voice came back to me. Dylan likes thin girls. I wasn't exactly fat, was I? As if to add on to my internal monologue, Annie spoke up. \"You aren't seriously going to eat that, right?\" She said mid chewing gum. Her pencilled eyebrows were raised high, they almost had disappeared. I glanced back at the big bowl and the packet of cereal in my hand. I ignored the growling in my stomach. \"No! Of course not\" I laughed shakily, hastily putting the bowel back and closing the cereal, just as Dylan walked into the room, shirt on and jumper at the ready. \"You ready to go Annie? Lily and I have to start chores\" He said, gesturing to the door. She huffed slightly, but got up, leaving her toast completely untouched on the table. \"Bye baby\" She said, leaning in to kiss him. He turned his head slightly, so she just missed his lips. I chuckled quietly. He mumbled bye, and she left with a flounce. There was a short silence as we both tried to recover from her presence. \"Erm, so, do you want to start clearing the store room?\" Dylan spoke up, running a hand through his hair. \"Sure\" I said, holding my stomach, which was still grumbling from its lack of food. It better be worth it. \"You ok?\" He said, looking at me with concern. I nodded, forcing on a smile, and decided to forget about this morning, and get on with the day. I took a drink of water, deciding that was all I really needed. He opened the door, and we walked down the path towards the store room, ready for the mess that waited for us, but inside I kept thinking about Annie and her oddly perfect figure. Dylan liked it. And if Dylan liked it, I should have it. ","Summary":" LILY POV My eyes flew open, and I groaned as i waved my hand around attempting to hit the alarm.

Please R&R;! :) - NicoleLexi.x It was a month since he told me he loved me. He was lying beside me in a clearing a little ways from the farm house – Our other special place, along with the roof. We were looking for pictures in the clouds, though it was pretty much only I, since he seemed unable to take his eyes off my face. \"That one looks like a dragon.\" I say, pointing to one. He slowly drew his eyes away from me to look where I was pointing. \"I think it looks like an alligator with wings.\" I make a face. \"No it doesn't!\" I exclaim, play slapping him on the arm. Even though it did look a bit like that. \"Whatever you say. Dragon it is.\" He says, holding his arms up in defeat. I smile, and lay back down. I see him start drawing in his sketchbook out of the corner of my eyes. \"What're you drawing?\" I ask, curious. His drawings were so beautiful, if a little morbid at times. \"Guess.\" He continues to focus on his drawing, and I turn to look at him. \"That flower?\" I glance over at a daisy. He'd started drawing more cheerful things after we started dating. \"Hm…\" He said thoughtfully. He looks up from his drawing at me, then at the daisy. He picked it carefully, and gently placed it in my hair, making my heart skip a beat. \"Now I am.\" He says with a smile. I move towards him and look at the drawing. A girl who's all smiles and curls looked back at me, her eyes sparkling with joy. He was currently adding a daisy to her hair, complimenting the golden color of sunshine that was her curls. \"It's beautiful, Dyl.\" I say, almost tearing up. He was drawing me . The girl he loved. \"Just like you.\" He replies with a smile. He leans over and kisses me on the cheek. \"Thanks.\" I murmur. My face had to be beet red. That was the first time he'd ever kissed me, though it was only on the cheek. We just sat together for a bit, him adding finishing touches to the portrait of me, me watching over his shoulder. It was getting chillier, and I shivered. He noticed and asked, \"Are you cold?\" I shiver again as another gust of wind blows right through me. \"A little bit.\" \"Here\" He takes off his hoodie and places it around my shoulders. \"Better?\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" I can't help but notice how it smells like him. \"We probably should head back though.\" \"Yeah.\" He replies. \"I think I'm done anyway.\" He closes the book and stands up, offering a hand to help me up, and I gladly take it. We walked like that, hand in hand, me with his hoodie across my shoulders, until we reached his house. He glanced at his watch. \"Crap! Its 6:30 already, we're late for dinner. Dad's going to kill me\" We walk inside and smell spaghetti instantly. Since his dad and my aunt had been dating, we had been eating more home cooked food at Dylan's house. I peek into the dining room. There was no one there. Obviously, we had missed dinner. \"Well, there's still some in the fridge, if you want it.\" We jump when we hear Aunt Kelly behind us. \"Okay, thanks.\" We both say in unison. We fixed us some leftovers and ate on the roof. When we finished, we sat together and watched the sunset. \"It's so inspiring.\" I murmur, in awe of the beautiful hues of orange and reds making way to the purples and blues of twilight. He glances over at me and smiles, and I realize that he's going to kiss me. He leans in slowly, making sure I was okay with it. When our lips touch, it feels almost magical. He places his hand on the small of my back to pull me closer to him. After a few seconds the kiss is over, and even though it was short, it felt like the best few moments in my entire life. \"I love you.\" He says, smiling. \"I love you too.\" A/N: Well, there you have it!

It was almost as full as the first day they opened. Benjamin walked around greeting people and answering any questions they had before he heard a fimiliar voice, \"Yo Benny!\" a man yelled. No one had ever called him Benny but one person. Benjamin turned around, \"Hello Chad.\" he said. The man in front of him was a bit shorter than Benjamin, had spiky brown hair and blue eyes and was well built. \"So Benny, you bought a zoo. Never would have guessed that one.\" Chad said. \"Yeah well alot has happened this year. But I'm glad I did it.\" he said, \"So what have you been up too?\" he asked. \"I'm running a restraunt now, Emillio's. \" \"Cool, I'm happy for you. You always wanted a restraunt.\" said Benjamin, and Chad smiled. \"Thanks man, so how is Rosie and Dylan?\" he asked. \"They are doing good. Rosie loves it here, I haven't seen her this happy in a while. And Dylan hasn't really gotten in any trouble in his new school in a while.\" he said. Chad smiled and nodded and just as he was about to open his mouth to say something Kelly walked over to him, \"Hey Benjamin, heres your new walkie.\" she said, handing him the walkie talkie. \"These are brand new so if you want to reach anyone you have to set it to a certain channel and hold down the top button. We each have differnt channels so I tape a piecce of paper on the back with all of our channels on it.\" said kelly, and Benjamin smiled. \"Thanks Kel.\" he said, and Kelly nodded. She flashed him a smile before walking off. \"Who was that?\" asked Chad. \"Kelly, she works here.\" he said, not really wanting to tell him what else Kelly is. \"I think I know how to get you more customers.\" he said, and Benjamin gave him a curious look. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. Meanwhile Kelly was in the garage cutting up some food when her walkie talkie began to beep. She pulled her out of her pocket and laughed to herself. Benjamin probably put it in his pocket and hit the button. She laughed again and listened to the conversation. \"So here's what you do dude, you get a bunch of really good looking girls to work here and when single dad's bring their kids they will keep coming back.\" he said. \"What's wrong with Kelly?\" asked Bejamin, slightly irratated. \"It's just, I don't know she's really not that pretty.\" he said. Kelly was shocked to say the least. She felt a something pulling at her emotions, but she didn't cry, she made sure she didn't. She continued to listen to the conversation. \"Dude your out of line!\" said Benjamin. \"I'm just saying it like it is man. She ain't that pretty and if you get some real hot chicks buisness would be boomin!\" he exclaimed \"Chad you have no right to say that.\" he said. \"Why dude? I'm not saying anything that isn't true! Why are you so defensive? What is she like your girlfriend or something?\" he said. Kelly couldn't believe that this man was saying such mean things about her. She had tears streaming down he cheeks and she frantically wiped them away, but they kept spilling out of her eyes. \"Actually she is! So why don't you get out of my zoo before I throw you out?\" he said. Chad was shocked and glared at Bejamin before walking away, not saying a word. Benjamin felt a sudden need to talk to Kelly, so he fished the walkie talkie out of his pocket only to find that the button was puched down and stuck. He looked at the channel log and at the walkie and found that it was set to Kelly's. He sighed and stormed off to find his girlfriend and see if she heard all the stuff chad had said. He walked around te zoo frantically looking for his girlfriend, when he ran into Lily. \"Hey Lily have you seen Kelly anywhere?\" he asked. \"Oh yeah I saw her about 20 minutes ago. She went into the garage because to cut up some more food, I haven't sen her since, but she's probably still in there.\" said Lily with a smiled. \"Thanks Lily.\" he said, and headed towards the garage. When he reached it he slowly walked in and at first he didn't see her, but when he looked again he found her leaning up against the farthest wall away from the door. Her walkie was on the table on the other side of the room and turned off. Benjamin walked in and made his way over to his girlfriend, who had her arms folded in front of her chest and tears running down her cheeks. Once he reached he didn't bother saying anything but just pulled her into a hug and let her cry in his arms. Once she was in his arms she broke down and began to cry even more, \"He said such hurtful things about me Benjamin.\" she said. \"Don't listen to him Kel.\" he said soothingly. \"But what if he's right? I know I'm not the most beautiful girl in the world, and I don't think I deserve you.\" she said and benjamin looked at her. \"Kelly Foster don't you ever say that about yourself\", he said in a serious tone, \"I think you are georgous. I think your beautiful, your amazing, your funny, your sweet, your stunning, your everything I can think of and so much more.\" he said. She had stopped crying to listen to him, and was shocked to hear him say all those things. \"But most importantly, your mine.\" he said. Kelly smiled and cupped his face in her hands, and layed her forehead against his. \"You Benjamin are just to amazing to be true.\" she said. \"Well believe it.\" she said, and crushed his lips against hers in a passionate kiss. When they broke for air Bejamin looked her in the eyes, \"Wanna stay at my house tonight?\" he asked, and her smiled grew. He wrapped his arms around her waist and she wrapped her around his neck. \"I would love too.\" ","Summary":" The zoo was packed today. It was almost as full as the first day they opened.

Even though there's a lot of stories already done for for Dylan and Lily, I've decided to write my very own story for the couple, and I'm going to have it pick up right from where the deleted scene with the two of them being on the roof together left off. I hope that all of you will like it. Please make sure to give a review after you've read the story, and I hope that you're ready, because it's quite a very long story. Enjoy! \"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.\" ~ Ancient China philosopher Lao Tzu First Date \"Dylan, I have a question to ask you. Would it really be a cliche for you to kiss me, while we're out in the rain and up here on the rooftop?\" Lily curiously asked. \"No, Lily, it was really just a joke, and I could definitely tell from the way you were smiling and laughing, you must have thought that it was a good one.\" Dylan answered. \"Yes, I did, and although I've relieved that you were only joking about kissing me, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask another question for you.\" Lily responded. \"I don't mind at all. No matter what it is, Lily, I'll make sure to give you a good answer for it, and so what did you want to know?\" Dylan asked. \"Do you think that it would be right to call this our very first date? I mean, even though we spent a bunch of times on the roof before, this time obviously feels much different.\" Lily replied. \"I agree with you, but I still think that a few more other things should happen in order to actually make it a first date for us.\" Dylan said, while hoping that Lily would go along with what he had in mind. \"Okay, but before you start, please tell me that these things aren't going to scare me, or even worse, give me any kind of horrible nightmares.\" Lily requested. \"Don't worry, none of these things are scary and they won't give you nightmares. I was just going to ask you out, since I've haven't already done that.\" Dylan responded. \"Dylan, I must say that's very sweet, but you don't really have to ask me out, and besides, I'm sure that you already did by asking me to come up to the roof.\" Lily said. \"If you should know, I'm trying to be a gentleman here, but before I do that, Lily Miska, I love you very much, and so would you like to become my girlfriend?\" Dylan asked. \"Yes, of course, and I would love for you to be my boyfriend. Now, since that's been settled, Dylan, could we please go somewhere else to hang out, and dry off as well?\" Lily said. \"Sure, and in that case, how about we head off to the barn, but there's a few things that I'm gonna get from inside the house first, so I'll make sure to meet you there as soon as possible.\" Dylan mentioned. \"Alright, I'll be waiting for you...but hold on, if it's not really that much, then maybe I could help you out in getting them, and besides, it isn't so much hard for me when it comes to keeping quiet, as well as sneaking around.\" Lily suggested. \"If tonight's going to be our first date, then we should at least have something to eat and drink, since that's what couples usually do when they go out.\" Dylan explained. \"My mom and dad used to always make time for each other, even after they got married and had me. Dylan, did your parents do the same too?\" Lily questioned. \"Yes, they did, so anyway, we should start making our way inside the house and bring back what we'd like from the kitchen. Lily, what are you hungry and thirsty for?\" Dylan asked. \"Actually, Dylan, I don't really want to have any food, especially at this time of night, but I'm quite alright with just getting some juice for us, if that's okay with you.\" Lily replied. \"Yes, Lily, I'm okay with that.\" Dylan said, while nodding his head to her, and they were very extra careful with coming off the roof and Lily suddenly stopped him just before they went inside the house. \"Wait, Dylan, maybe we should first take off our jackets and boots before we go inside. We wouldn't want to make a dirty mess around the floor, don't you think?\" Lily asked. \"Yes, that's a good idea.\" Dylan responded, agreeing, and with that decided, the young couple helped each other out of their rainwear while being the most quiet they could possibly ever be. \"Lily, it doesn't matter to you what type of juice we'll have? Whether it's apple, orange, or even grape, because I'm sure that any of those flavors are good for us.\" Dylan assumed. \"How about we go for some fruit punch, so that way, we can be able to have a bunch of flavors instead of just only one. Doesn't that sound great?\" Lily questioned, while giving another of her bright smiles. \"Even better,\" Dylan said, smiling back, just as he opened the door to the refrigerator, and soon found a good collection of about eight Allen's fruit punch juice boxes on the top shelf, and Dylan decided to take out half of them. \"Dylan, I should carry a few juice boxes myself, and besides, it wouldn't really be fair for you to be carrying all of them at once, even if this is our first date, and you're trying to be a gentleman.\" Lily requested. \"Okay, and I'll let you carry two, because if it goes that way, we'll be even.\" Dylan said, as he passed half of the juices boxes over to his girlfriend, who used both of her hands to hold each one. Lily was about to set down the juice boxes on the floor, so that she could be able to put on her boots and rain jacket, when Dylan suddenly stopped her, which caused the girl to be turning around to face her boyfriend. \"Hey, Lily, I just wanna know, before we go out there, how would you like to join me in having some amazing fun with twenty seconds of insane courage?\" Dylan asked, while starting to get very nervous about the crazy idea that he just came up with. \"I'd love to, but Dylan, how would we have fun? Just running from here all the way to the barn? I think that it might be better for us to try something new and different.\" Lily recommended. \"Lily, that's exactly what I was thinking, and so my idea was that we could run as fast as possible to barn while holding the juice boxes, but without wearing our boots and jackets.\" Dylan suggested. \"Dylan, there's no way I'm going to do that! We could get seriously drenched right when we go out there, and it would possibly take until morning for our clothes to dry. Are you really sure that it's a good idea?\" Lily questioned. \"Yes, I'm sure, because it's definitely something that's completely new and different for us to do. I understand if you're quite worried and nervous, but if it helps, you could close your eyes, and keep them shut, while I'm holding your hand, and it won't be scary for you.\" Dylan said. \"I'm not scared of the rain. It's just that I don't always like to feel so cold, so if you wouldn't mind, could you please help me get more warmed up when we're inside the barn?\" Lily asked. \"Lily, I love you, and that's why I'd do anything for you. Whether it's helping you take care of the animals, or making you feel better when you're sick, even though I'm only fourteen years old, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you happy.\" Dylan declared. \"Wow, Dylan, I really believe that's the most sweet and thoughtful thing anyone's ever said to me, which is why I want to know that I love you too, and last, but not least, I'd like for you to close your eyes so that I can give you a nice kiss.\" Lily responded. \"First, I would like to say that it's about time for us to have our kiss now,\" Dylan replied back, before closing his eyes and actually puckering up his lips a little bit, and waited for his girlfriend to press her own mouth against his. \"Except that there's only one thing left for you to do first. You'll just have to catch me,\" Lily whispered into his ear, and she quickly opened the front door, went through it, and started running in the heavy downpour of earth's natural water. Dylan opened his eyes and immediately followed in her path, going about the same speed he was in while racing over to Lily's bedroom window to confess that he loved her after seeing her sign which was only half an hour ago. Once she was a good far distance away from the house, Lily couldn't help but give out a little shriek from feeling all of the multiple never ending raindrops come down on her, which caused Dylan to burst out laughing from hearing the sound of it. Less than about five minutes had passed before Lily finally reached the barn, with Dylan instantly catching up to her, since he wasn't really so far behind, and he stopped laughing when he saw Lily's face, and although she wasn't crying, she did look pretty upset. \"Lily, I know that you're probably thinking it was a bad idea for us to do this, and you're also not happy at me for encouraging you, but I'd like to give you something that could possibly make you feel better...\" Dylan said, looking her in the eyes. \"So would you please tell me what is it?\" Lily asked, moving her head up to look back at Dylan, who gave a bright smile, before slowly leaning closer to her, and he was quite hesitant, because Dylan didn't want to have Lily all freaked out, and that's why he wanted to make sure that she was okay with it. Lily smiled back, as she leaned in to meet him, and after a few seconds had passed, their lips had finally met, and the feeling was very nice and sweet at first, with his lips being soft and warm, which it caused Lily to have an inside feeling of sparks flying, which made her crave for more. Dylan moved both of his hands to rest on Lily's waist, while Lily had her own hands begin to subconsciously make their way around Dylan's neck, and soon lose themselves in his wet and messy hair, as the kissing didn't stop, since neither of them had wanted to end this moment. Dylan pressed his tongue against Lily's lips, begging for an entrance, and she quickly agreed and gladly let him in, opening her mouth for Dylan to carefully slide his tongue in and explore, while Lily did the same thing, which had their tongues battle for dominance. Unfortunately, neither of the young teenagers had actually won, due to the increased lack of air, and that's why both of them eventually pulled away from one another, needing to take deep and heavy breaths before they could return on at least talking to each other. \"Wow,\" Dylan and Lily murmured that word at the exact same time, which led to them giving a smile at each other before they came out laughing, but it soon came to an end when Lily started to sneeze, and Dylan believed that they might possibly get sick from still wearing their wet clothes. \"You know what, Lily, I'm pretty sure that if we don't get out of these clothes right away, then we'll probably catch an awful cold really soon, and so I'll give you privacy while you get yourself out of them.\" Dylan informed, just as he started to take off his t-shirt. \"Now hold on, Dylan. I was okay with running outside in the rain, but there's absolutely no way that I'm going to be stripping down naked, especially if I'm inside a barn. Besides, in case you didn't know before, but we happen to be too young for us with taking that step.\" Lily reminded. \"Yes, I know that, Lily, but I was actually thinking that we can stay in just our underwear, take off everything else, and leave them somewhere around in this barn to dry off, while we do the same, and I was thinking that we could go up to where I spent time on my drawings.\" Dylan suggested. \"Okay, Dylan, that sounds like a much better plan to me, and if you don't mind, I'd like to go first, but you have to close your eyes, and wait until I've told you to open them.\" Lily responded, and Dylan immediately did what Lily had requested for him to do. She got started with her converse sneakers, as well as her socks, before taking off her white sweater, then her plaid shirt, and finally, Lily unzipped her blue jeans, and made sure to have everything folded up before putting them all in a neat pile for her to easily carry. While holding her clothes close to her body with one hand, Lily used the other to carefully climb up the ladder to the upper level of the barn, and she laid the pile of her clothes in a corner of the floor before going walking over to the edge. \"Alright, Dylan, you can open your eyes now, and take off your clothes except for, of course, your underwear.\" Lily called out, and she was quickly blushing like a bright red tomato right when she said that, and looked around for a good spot on the floor to sit down and wait for Dylan to join her. Just about more than five minutes had passed by until Lily could see her boyfriend coming up the ladder, and she didn't much of his body at first, since he was holding the rest of his clothes to his chest, just like she did when going up the ladder first. Dylan decided that it was best for him to lay down the pile of his clothes right next to his girlfriend's, and so that way, both of them could easily remember where they had left their clothes, if they were ever to forget, and he realized something when he turned around to face Lily. This happen to be the very first time that he and Lily were seeing each other in much less than what they usually wore during all of the times that they hung out with one another, and Dylan had to admit that it was incredibly awkward, considering that neither had ever really done this with anyone else before. Lily was wearing only a bright pink bra, and her panties were the exact same color, while Dylan wore blue colored briefs, and she got even more nervous when he walked over to sit with her, and neither of them had even bothered to make conversation, and just stared at each other for a few minutes until Lily spoke up. \"So please tell me, Dylan. If the plan is for us to wait here until our clothes get dry, what do you suggest that we do to pass the time? I would really like to do some drawing, but I left my notebook back in my room in the house, and I already went out in the rain once, so I'm not doing it again.\" Lily asked. \"How about you and me play a few fun games, like there's Truth or Dare, and 20 questions...\" Dylan began to come up with ideas, but he stopped and surprised to see that Lily didn't seem to look very interested, since she would usually be excited. \"Honestly, Dylan, I didn't really expect for us to be spending our first date together in our underwear from getting our clothes terribly wet from the rain, and I was hoping that maybe we could just do one last thing that's romantic, like have a slow dance, even though there isn't any music.\" Lily suggested, while suddenly starting to cry. \"Lily, I'm so sorry about making you do this. I was only trying to have tonight be our best first date. I completely understand if you don't want to talk to me ever again.\" Dylan responded, while moving away to give her space. \"Wait a minute, Dylan. I have to admit that I'm a little upset with you, but not so much that I wouldn't ever want to speak to you. I love you, and I still want to be your girlfriend, as well as for you to be my boyfriend. I hope that you're angry with me.\" Lily replied. \"What reason could I have to be angry with you, Lily? You didn't do anything wrong at all, and besides, it's all my fault for getting us into this awkward situation, so you should be a lot more than just a little upset with me.\" Dylan said. \"That's the problem, I don't even want to be upset or angry with you. I've been awful to you, especially by complaining too much, and I guess it's because for what's not actually the first time, I don't really know what we should do.\" Lily explained. Dylan suddenly got up from where he was sitting, turned around stand in front of his girlfriend, and lent out one of his hands for her. \"Lily Miska, if you're still up for it, I would to have that dance with you. So what do you say?\" Dylan asked. \"I say...yes, I love to dance with you.\" Lily answered, just as she took his hand, which helped her get up from the floor, and she decided to wrap her arms around her boyfriend's neck, while Dylan slowly put his hands on each side of Lily's waist once again. \"Hey, Lily, what about if we have the sound of the rain be the music for our dance? I don't know about you, but I can hear it coming down pretty hard on the roof above us.\" Dylan said, and a smile eventually came across his girlfriend's face. \"Dylan, that's such a wonderful idea, considering the fact that I love listening to all sorts of noise that's made from the weather, and I usually enjoy it when I'm inside my room.\" Lily said, trying to be sarcastic. \"Yeah, me too,\" Dylan replied, while having a few laughs, and the two of them soon stayed quiet as possible, since the heavy raindrops was their only music for them to be slow dancing to, and the young couple had gotten quickly lost in each other's eyes before Dylan spoke up. \"I know that it must be so cheesy for me to say all of this but, Lily, you're absolutely the most beautiful girl I've ever known, and you're also sweet, kind, and funny. Before meeting you here, I was stuck in a very dark place, and sometimes I thought that it would stay that way forever, and so if it wasn't for you to be spending more time with me, then I never would have been brought out of it, so that's why I want to thank you.\" Dylan declared, before kissing Lily on her forehead. \"Oh, Dylan, now that has to be the most sweet and thoughtful thing that anyone has ever said to me, and your welcome. It's really nice for me to know that I've brought someone out from a dark place.\" Lily responded, and gave him a kiss on the lips. She was certainly surprised when only a few seconds had went by before Dylan pulled her in with one of his hands that was on her waist, and poked at her lips a few times with his tongue, and they were back to making out, while occasionally coming up for breath a few times. Lily began to run her hands down Dylan's chest, calmly feeling his skin, with her boyfriend's own hands doing the same for a while until he instantly stopped and looked up to face her, because there was something that he thought was important to ask Lily about. \"You know, Lily, we've never really had the talk about doing this, and I wouldn't ever want you to be doing something that you'll regret later in your life, but if you're sure...\" Dylan stopped talking when Lily held a few fingers to his mouth. \"I agree with you, Dylan. Having sex is a very big step for every relationship, and that's why it's best that we should wait, not only because tonight is our first date, but until it actually feels right, and besides, we're way too young for that anyway.\" Lily explained. \"Good to hear, because it wouldn't be that much comfortable for us to be doing it right here on a wooden floor in the barn. A nice bed in the house is obviously a better choice.\" Dylan said, while trying to be sarcastic himself. \"Since we've taken care of that issue, I'm actually feeling quite tired, so whether or not if the rain does stop tonight, could we please stay here instead? I think that our clothes are dry enough now for us to wear them again.\" Lily replied, turning around to look at their piles of clothes. \"Yeah, sure, we can stay. Please just wait here, and I'll get your clothes for you,\" Dylan responded, as he walked over to the corner, picked up Lily's pile and handed it over to her, while he got started with putting his clothed back on, beginning with his socks. Lily had done the same routine she did when taking them off earlier, with her socks and sneakers first, and then her blue jeans, her plaid shirt, and finally, her white sweater before taking a deep breath and turning around to see that Dylan was already back in his clothes too. \"Well then, I guess you can say all of that time of us being in our underwear was a great sneak peek of what we'll see during our first time, at least, in the future.\" Lily said, while blushing once again. \"Yes, and I'll definitely be looking forward to it, whenever it comes for us, but in the meantime, what do you say that we conclude this night by going to sleep in each other's arms?\" Dylan suggested, as he sat down in the corner on the floor, waiting for Lily to join him. \"I say that it would be an amazing way to end what I'm sure was the best first date I've ever had.\" Lily answered, just as she went down and snuggled close to Dylan's chest while he wrapped his arms around her. \"I love you, Dylan Mee.\" Lily softly whispered. I love you too, Lily Miska.\" Dylan quietly replied back before they soon fell asleep for the remainder of the night. Fin ","Summary":" A/N: Hello, and welcome, fellow authors and readers!

At least I think that's their couple name. I couldn't think of any others that sounded right to me. So the title and summary might not give off the right impression for the story but either way, it's true somehow. Dylan and Lily were in said girl's room, laying on her bed while staring up at the ceiling. At least she was. He, on other hand, was staring at her. Feeling a little awkward under his intense gaze, Lily finally turned to him. \"What is it?\" she asked, breaking the silence they had been in. \"Nothing,\" he said, just barely smiling as he turned back to the ceiling. Lily sighed and looked up, hesitating before grabbing his hand. After all, they were boyfriend and girlfriend right? \"As fun as it is staring at the ceiling,\" Lily said, \"I'm bored.\" Dylan nodded in agreement. \"Let's play a game,\" he said, his thumb riding over her knuckles. \"What kind of game?\" Lily asked. \"We could play 20 questions,\" her boyfriend suggested. \"Sure,\" she said. \"I'll start. What's your favorite food?\" Dylan smirked and twirled one of her blond curls. \"Pizza,\" he answered. \"What is your favorite... Time of day?\" Lily glanced around her room. \"Morning I guess,\" she said finally. Her boyfriend looked with her oddly. \"That would explain why your so peppy at the crack of dawn,\" he said, kissing her temple. Lily let out a laugh. \"My turn,\" she stated. She thought for a really good question that would really embarrass him. \"How many girlfriends did you have before me?\" the blond asked finally, looking at him. But Dylan wouldn't meet her gaze. There was a sigh Then silence. \"3,\" he mumbled. Lily had to strain herself to hear him. She just shrugged. \"'Kay. Your turn,\" she told him. Dylan looked at her in disbelief. \"Your not freaking out!\" he said turning to her. His girlfriend shook her head, causing her blond curls to fly around her face. \"No, but apparently you are,\" Lily said as he reached over and tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. \"It's just that I thought you would be jealous or something,\" Dylan said. She shrugged again. \"No,\" Lily said. \"I'm not really the jealous type.\" Dylan let out a laugh and kissed her cheek. \"Good to know,\" he said smirking. \"Now go,\" Lily said, giggling slightly. She pulled herself into a sitting position and waited for him to speak as he sat up next to her. \"Do you like to draw?\" Dylan finally asked. The blond perked up and nodded enthusiastically as she grabbed a small black leather book from her bedside table. \"They aren't as 'dark' as yours,\" Lily told him as he opened it. \"But ya know.\" The boy was in awe of what he saw. The first one that caught his attention was a picture of a tree. It had a thick, long trunk with a face of a woman carved into it. Long, skinny branches reached on wildy while covered in dark green leave as big as a baseball. The time had to be about mid-day. The sky was grayish, tiny raindrop sprinking onto the leaves. \"These are amazing,\" he breathed out, flipping the page. More sketchs of everything from animals to places covered the pages. Dylan was aware of Lily looking over his shoulder, her breath feeling warm on his neck. \"What's your favorite thing to draw?\" Lily asked him as he stared at a drawing of tall crashing waves. \"People,\" the brunette said in a daze as he gave her the book back. \"How long have you been doing that type of thing?\" He asked as she placed the book carefulling into the drawer and closing is shut. Lily turned to him and pursed her lips. \"I dunno,\" she said quietly, tapping her fingers against her soft comforter. \"For about three or four years.\" The room fell silent. Lily fingered a loose thread on the hem of her jacket. \"My turn,\" she said. About an hour later, they had ran out questions and had turned on the radio in Lily's room. Paramore's \"The Only Exception\" was playing throughout the room softly. \"I'm bored again,\" Lily whined as she hopped off the bed. \"So what are we going to do?\" Dylan asked, watching as she made her way to the door. \"Going to your house,\" she said before walking out the door. The boy shrugged and followed her out of the house. She led the way into his room and flopped onto the bed, staring at the ceiling. Her boyfriend leaned against the door frame. \"So what exactly are we supposed to do in my room?\" he asked as he sat next to her. \"Ask each other questions,\" Lily said simply. \"But I thought we were done playing 20 questions?\" \"So? Is it a crime to you to ask questions?\" \"Whatever.\" The girl smiled and stood, walking around the room, almost as if inspecting it. \"Why did you hate this place at first?\" the blond asked suddenly, turning so fast to face the boy that Dylan thought she would fall over. The brunette shrugged as his girlfriend walked over and sat down next to him. \"I was mostly mad at my dad then,\" he said, grabbing Lily's hand. \"But now, I have gotten used to have it looks and...Smells.\" The two looked at each other before bursting out laughing. They fell back and rolled onto one another, both almost close to tears from laughing too hard. When the blond stopped, she realized the position they had unknowingly gotten into. Dylan was laying on top of her, his hands that were on either side of her head keeping him propped up. \"Now I have a question,\" he said quietly, leaning down so that his forehead touched hers. \"Tell me,\" Lily said just as softly. \"Do you want to kiss as much as I want to kiss you?\" \"Yes. Yes I do.\" He let out a small laugh before crashing their lips together. Dylan moved his hand to cup Lily's cheek while the other one rested on her waist.. She kissed wholeheartedly, her hand losing itself in his hair. They pulled away after a couple minutes, both breathing heavily. Dylan lost himself in Lily's eyes for millionth time since he met her. He made his lips hover a centimeter abover her left ear. \"Guess what?\" he whispered softly. \"What?\" \"I love you.\" Lily let out a giggle, making Dylan smirk. \"I love you too.\" Awww! Wasn't that a sweet ending? Anyway, I had this idea for a while now and justed wanted to get it done. Tell me what you think. SO PRESS THE BUTTON!

This is a oneshot that is set the day after Dylan and Benjamin have the big fight. It made me so sad when Rosie came out of her room. So I wrote this scene. I thought Robin was a very sweet character, though he wasn't cast as a huge roll and there are little comments here and there throughout the film that left me with the impression that he and Rosie would have been friends of sorts. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it! Reviews and feedback would be greatly appreciated :) You have to talk to them right. Robin had told them that from the start. Animals don't respond to baby voices and goo-goo noises. You have to be real with them. Benjamin was getting there… sort of. The man was a bit of a goofball, but he really was trying hard. Which was more than could be said for his son. As far as anyone knew, Dylan was keeping his interactions with the animals (and everyone else for that matter) to a minimum. Aside from, of course, a memorable kick to an unfortunate exotic snake. Rosie on the other hand, had taken to it like a duck to water. Most kids her age do. They see animals differently to adults and so they talk to them as if they will really understand what they're saying. And the truth is that they can. Not words and sentences of course, but tone and emotion. Animals can always tell when you're afraid of them, or if you're a threat. Or when you mean them no harm. From nearly the very first day that the Mee's had arrived at their new home, the peacocks followed Rosie everywhere she went. She was constantly running out of crackers because she would feed them to the birds instead of eating them herself. And she talked to them. She'd named them all and could tell them all apart. Dylan would insist that they were all the same and there was no way she could possibly tell the difference between them. They were just birds after all, they were all identical. Rosie would just ignore the comments and continue explaining to him which was Abby and which was Fiona. Robin didn't say anything, but Rosie was right. She never mixed them up. Each had it's own name. Each looked different from the next, which was true of all animals. Just like people. If you spent enough time with them, you could see those differences. And even if Dylan couldn't see them – or perhaps didn't bother to look for them – Rosie could. So when Robin walked past Rosie on the way to the monkey enclosure early one morning, and she wasn't talking to the peacocks who pecked at the ground around her, he knew something was wrong. He slowed to a stop and looked around. Benjamin was nowhere to be seen. Robin figured he'd be with Spar, he wasn't handling the tiger's declining health very well. Only yesterday Robin had tried to tell him that it was time to call the vet, but Benjamin hadn't wanted to hear it. It was never easy deciding when one of the animal's time had come, but it was better than to make them suffer. Robin pulled himself out of his thoughts and back to the present. He looked back at the little girl. It wasn't unusual for her to be walking around on her own; all the zoo staff adored her, so everyone kept an eye out for her while she wandered about 'her zoo'. It was unusual however, to see her with such a miserable look on her face. Robin moved towards her, \"Hey kiddo,\" he said gently, \"are the Peacocks extra hungry or something? You guys don't seem to be doing much chatting today.\" Rosie gave a glum shrug, she didn't look up. \"Rosie,\" he crouched down beside her, \"what's wrong?\" Rosie looked up at him, he could see a question dancing on her lips but she seemed hesitant to let it go. \"You know you can tell me anything, right?\" \"…and you won't tell anybody else?\" Robin gave a small smile, \"I promise.\" Rosie scrunched her mouth into a grimace as she stared at him, weighing him up. He thought for a moment that she was going to keep her mouth closed but then, in her tiny voice, she asked, \"Is the Easter Bunny real?\" Robin furrowed his brow and let out a cautious sigh. He moved to sit down beside Rosie and reached out to take a few of her crackers, he gave one to the Capuchin on his shoulder and began to break the rest up to feed to the Peacocks. \"What makes you think he wouldn't be real?\" he asked her, gently. Rosie propped her elbow up on her knee and rested her cheek in her hand as she threw down more crackers, half-heartedly. \"Daddy and Dylan had a fight last night,\" she told him, \"It was really loud. They fight all the time now that Mommy's in Heaven… Daddy's mad at Dylan for not being happy. And Dylan is mad about everything-\" Robin didn't say anything, he just watched the little girl as she continued to tell her story. She recounted the conversation as children often do; only repeating things that seemed to stick out to them, and most likely missing important points because they don't seem to make sense to them. But Rosie was a smart kid, and she seemed to get most of what the pair had been saying. Something that made Robin suspect that she'd been a fly on the wall for far more than just that one argument between the father and son. \"-and then Dad said, 'we live with a little girl who still believes in the Easter Bunny'… but… I thought everyone believed in the Easter Bunny… because he's real… right?\" she sounded so perplexed. As if she wanted to have said it like it was some ridiculous notion, but there was something about it that made her feel unsure. Robin hesitated, studying the little girl beside him. Her eyes were as big as saucers as she stared at him, waiting for answers to her questions. He saw hope in them. Hope that he would make it better. \"The truth is, Rosie…\" Robin chose his words carefully, and Rosa tilted her head a little as she watched him, \"the truth is that not everyone does believe in the Easter Bunny.\" \"Oh,\" she said softly, bowing her head. She suddenly looked as if the weight of the world rested upon her shoulders but Robin put an arm around her tiny frame, offering her a comforting hug and she looked back up at him again. \"You see ,\" he went on, \"sometimes, when bad things happen to good people – like little girls losing their Mommies – it can make them so sad that they start to think maybe other good things in their lives aren't really there either.\" \"Like the Easter Bunny?\" her voice was small and hesitant. Robin smiled and nodded, \"like the Easter Bunny.\" He repeated, \"Your Daddy doesn't ever want you to be that sad. So what he meant when he said that to Dylan, was that even though you're sad about your Mommy, you're still happy about lots of other things. And he doesn't want anything to happen to make you lose that happiness... Does that make sense?\" Rosie thought about it, scrunching her nose up a little, \"yeah,\" she said finally, \"it does. And that's why Daddy is angry at Dylan for not being happy either. Because if me or Dylan feels sad, then he's sad, too. And then no one gets to believe in the Easter Bunny.\" Robin could see that Rosie's mind was working overtime. He had only to put two and two together to know that she was worrying about her brother. The kid was definitely a piece of work. But when Robin thought about it, he had every right to be. No child should ever have to lose a parent that age. And not only that, but he'd lost his home, his school and his friends. And try as he might, Benjamin would never have been able to provide the amount of comfort he would have needed, because he'd loved her and lost her too. Robin felt guilt bubble up inside of him; it had been at least four months since he'd even called to talk to his parents. He made a mental note to do so. But that could wait. For the time being, he turned back to the little girl with crumb-filled hands. \"Can I tell you a secret, Rosie?\" Robin whispered, pretending to check that no one else was listening. Rosie straightened up and nodded eagerly. Rosie liked secrets, she liked to prove that she could hold them in and never tell anyone else. She liked to know things that no one else would ever know. She leaned in closer so that Robin could whisper in her ear. \"Crystal, here,\" Robin gestured to his Capuchin, \" knows the Easter Bunny.\" Rosie gave a mighty gasp, \"really?\" she exclaimed. \"Really,\" Robin told her, \"he comes here and visits her every single Easter.\" \"Wow…\" Rosie breathed. \"And do you know what I think?\" Robin asked. Rosie shook her head. \"I think – in fact, I know – Crystal likes you,\" as if on cue, the monkey tilted his head and gave the girl a cheeky grin, \"and I bet that she puts in a good word for you when she sees him next Easter.\" Rosie grinned, \"Dylan and Daddy, too?\" Robin returned the smile, \"Dylan and Daddy, too.\" He reached up and took hold of Crystal, removing her from his shoulder and placing her onto Rosie's. As the Capuchin began to pick playfully at her hair, Robin couldn't help but to grin when he saw that Rosie was smiling once again. There you go! Hope you enjoyed it :) Let me know!

It was two weeks before the zoo reopened and Robin Jones walked into the Jaguar café after work and noticed has boss Benjamin mee and Kelly Foster talking to a pretty blonde he had never seen before. \"Hi Benjamin hi Kelly\" said Robin. \"Hi Robin\" said Benjamin and Kelly. \"Who's your new friend he asked?\". \"This is Michelle Davidson are new zoo secretary\" replied Benjamin. \"Nice to meet you Michelle am Robin Jones maybe I could show you around the zoo sometime\" he said. \"Nice to meet you Robin I wed like that very much\" Michelle said. \"Robin is are craftsman\" said Kelly. \"Who's that over there asked?\" Michelle \"that's Peter Macready he and Robin do everything around hear but feed the animals\" said Benjamin. \"WARTER FERIS THAT S.O.B STOLE MY IDEAS!\" Peter screamed as he threw a dart at the dart bored across the room. \"who's Walter Ferris asked Michelle?\" \" He is are zoo inspector\" replied Kelly. \"last time he came here for a pop bye we had to lock Peter in a room at my house\" said Benjamin. \"I hope things go better when he comes back in two days for the inspection\" said Kelly \"Me too\" said Robin. \"me three\" replied Benjamin. \"Wed you like a bear?\" asked Robin. \"Yes I wed\" replied Michelle. \"Hear you go\" said Robin handing her the bear. \"Thank you Robin\" she said taking the bear. \"Hi dad hi Kelly\" said Rosie as she walked in to the Jaguar café with her brother Dylan. \"Think god its Friday!\" said Dylan. \"Hi kid's\" said Benjamin. \"Who's this?\" asked Rosie \"This is Michelle honey she is are new zoo secretary\" replied Benjamin. \" I thought uncle Duncan was doing that for you?\" Asked Dylan. \"No he is just going to be doing the books for me\" replied Benjamin. \"Nice to meet you\" said Rosie. \"Nice to meet you Rosie \" said Michelle. \"Nice to meet you\" replied Dylan. \"Nice to meet you guys\" said Michelle.

","Summary":" AN/ Sorry for all the rewrites but I wanted to get it just right and now I have. I don't own the ch"},{"Movie":"We Bought a Zoo","Title":"The Real Reason","Author":"This is a Creative Name","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7699388","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: So, I pretty much fell in love with We Bought A Zoo right after I saw it. It was a great movie, and I loved Lily/Dylan. They're the cutest couple ever. Seriously. So, I knew I had to write a story for them. Sadly, there isn't a section for it yet, so I'll repost it under WBAZ when it does get a section. Anyway, here's a Lylan One-Shot talking about the reason Lily lives with Kelly. Disclaimer: I don't own anything you recognise from this story! \"Could you talk to her? Please?\" Kelly Foster practically begged her boyfriend's son. She was referring to Lily Miska, her niece. \"Yeah, of course. I was actually going to ask her if she wanted to hang out or-\" \"No, she won't want to. She always gets quiet around this time of the year, but she usually talks to me. Today she won't and it's…well it's weird. She's been in her room all day and she ignores me if I go in there. It's like she's asleep, but her eyes are open. Lily never sleeps with her eyes open. I would think she was dead if I didn't hear her get up to go to the bathroom every few hours…\" Kelly rambled, walking him down the hall to Lily's room. \"Okay, relax. I'll talk to her.\" Dylan said, rolling his eyes. He didn't honestly think his girlfriend of two months was just laying on her bed . She was probably the most energetic person he had ever met; she rarely sat still. Lily really only sat still when she was with him and even then only when he was drawing. Not wanting to invade her privacy, he knocked on her door first. When he didn't hear anything, he hesitated. Was she really as bad as Kelly had made her sound? \"Lily? It's me, Dylan. Can I come in?\" He asked, knocking again. When he received no reply, he slowly opened the door. True to Kelly's word, Lily was lying on her bed, staring up at the ceiling. She didn't look sad or upset, just…empty. Some how, this was worse than her crying. \"Lily?\" He asked timidly. She didn't say anything for a few seconds, then shifted slightly to look at him. \"Lily, what's the matter?\" Dylan asked, walking over to her bed. He had never really comforted anyone besides Rosie, and usually he just had to hug her and she would be better. Needless to say, he was a bit uncomfortable. \"Nothing.\" Her voice sounded dry and hoarse, like she had been crying. But her clear blue eyes weren't red, so he didn't think she had been. \"Do not give me that. You're obviously upset, so tell me what's wrong.\" She was quiet again, and she moved to stare back up at the ceiling. \"You don't want to know.\" Now that hurt. \"Yes, I do.\" Dylan said a little forcefully. He moved to sit down next to her on the bed and she let him. \"Now, tell me what's wrong.\" \"No, I didn't mean it like that. I know you want to know, but it's not something you can un-hear.\" \"What do you mean?\" He asked, laying down next to her. \"I mean, once you hear it, you'll wish you hadn't. If it were me, I wouldn't want to know.\" She said. \"Please tell me?\" Dylan asked, turning to face her. \"Do you know why I live here? With Kelly, I mean.\" Her change of subject threw him off a little. \"No, not really.\" \"Because my mom's dead too. She was my aunt's sister, so Kelly took me in.\" That definitely threw him off. He felt like someone had punched him in the gut. \"I'm sorry, Lil. I know that doesn't make it better though.\" He admitted, reaching for her hand. It had always fascinated him; she had the longest fingers. They were delicate and pale, slender too. Dylan loved playing with them, which usually made Lily giggle, which in turn made him laugh. \"No, it's okay. It happened when I was really little, like Rosie's age.\" \"So, is that what this is about?\" Dylan asked before he could stop himself. \"Sorry, that was kind of rude…you don't have to tell me.\" \"No, I…I guess it's okay.\" Lily sighed and stared at her ceiling. She didn't say anything for a long time. \"Everyone always told me I looked just like my mother. I guess I had it coming.\" \"Had what coming?\" Dylan asked. \"When my mom died, Dad handled it a lot differently than your dad did. First he kind of threw himself into his work. Then when that didn't help, he started drinking a lot. He drank all the time, so much that he got fired. Then, he just began drinking during the day too. He said it helped 'ease the pain' and I should just keep my damn mouth shut.\" That really got Dylan's attention. Lily never cussed. Like, never. She hated it when he did and was trying to get him to quit. \"Then when I turned ten, he began to notice how much I looked like my mom. I have her blonde hair and pale skin. Anyway, he began acting kind of weird. He would get angry at me if I did something wrong and he would yell at me for leaving him. He would say it wasn't my time to go and I shouldn't have left him with 'the kid.' It was just yelling for a long time…then he hit me. At first it was just a slap every now and then, but then he began to hit me with his beer bottles and with his belt.\" At this point, tears were rolling down Lily's face. She wasn't sobbing, but she was definitely crying. \"Then one day, he left. He packed a suit case and he just left me alone at the house. Dad wrote a note, saying he couldn't handle seeing my face everyday and that I was a burden to him. He left before I got home from school. I didn't know what to do, so I called Kelly. She came and stayed with me for a week before she took me to stay here. \"Dad called me last night. He said it was my fault Mom died. She had cancer, but the chemo didn't work. Dad said that she knew she had nothing to live for and that's why she died. She never wanted me; I was an accident. He never wanted me either.\" Lily admitted, biting her lip. Dylan was appalled. How could anyone think Lily was an accident? Sure, she was a bit over-the-top bubbly sometimes and she got on his nerves occasionally, but she was also the sweetest and prettiest girl he'd ever met. There wasn't a mean bone in her body. \"Today's the six year anniversary of her death.\" \"Lily, you're perfect. Trust me, he has no idea what he's talking about.\" \"I'm an accident .\" The way she said the word accident was the same way some people would say dirty gym socks. \"Even if that's true, which it probably isn't, you are the best accident ever. If you'd never been born, I'd still be some sulky jerk who only cares about himself. Rosie wouldn't have anyone to look up to. I wouldn't have any friends or have a girlfriend.\" He said the last part with a light blush on his cheeks. \"I love you, no matter what.\" She looked up at him, and rolled over to face him for the first time. \"Really?\" \"Really.\" He said, tucking a strand of her perfect blonde hair behind her ear. \"I love you too, no matter what.\" She promised, smiling slightly. It was no where near as bright as her usual smile was, but it was a start. Dylan smiled back at her, before hesitantly leaning closer to her. He didn't want to freak her out, so he was giving her a chance to back out. Slowly, she leaned to meet him. Their lips met after a few seconds, and it was nice. It was a bit awkward, given that it was their first kiss, but it was still nice. His lips were soft and warm, and her's tasted like chap stick. When they broke apart (four seconds later [yes, they both counted]), both were smiling. Lily's real smile was back, as was Dylan's. \"If you'd never been born, that would have never happened.\" Dylan pointed out, making her laugh. The couple laid in silence for a second, just smiling and thinking. \"Dylan, do you think Mom thought of me as an accident? I know you never knew her, but…\" \"No, I don't. Well, maybe at first, but how could anyone think of you as an accident? You're always nice, even when I'm a jerk to you, and you're funny. You always know what to say to cheer someone up and you have the prettiest hair ever.\" He said, playfully tugging on one of her blonde curls. She smiled and giggled, shoving him slightly. \"Yeah, well…you know how to cheer me up and you're nice when you want to be. Plus, you're the best artist I've ever seen and you can always make me laugh.\" Lily said, playfully tugging on his hair too. \"Hey! That hurt.\" He said, laughing. \"No it didn't, you're laughing.\" Lily pointed out. \"Yeah, I know.\" Dylan said, poking her. A/N: So, did you like it? Hate it? Hopefully you liked it.

He knocks impatiently on it before she appears \"Hey is Lily here\" He says looking for his girlfriend \"Yeah she is in her room go on in\" She says pointing to the room down the hall. He thanks her before heading in. She doesn't notice him but when he appears in her doorway she smiles up at him and motions for him to come in. \"Hey Dyl\" She says smiling brightly at him using her nickname for him \"Hey Lil\" He says using his nickname for her as he sits on the edge of her bed \"Last time you were in this room you told me you loved me\" She says playing with the ends of her hair \"Yeah I did and it's still true to this day\" Well I never got to say it back but I love you too\" She says giving him a light peek on the cheek \"I'll always love you whatever happens\" He says in a serious tone \"Why what's going on\" She says curiously \"Um my dad is moving us back to the city\" He says looking down at his shoes \"What\" She whispers softly still trying to wrap her mind around the idea \"Yeah I don't want to though I did before but now I know I don't want to I can't leave you.

(The Next Day) \"Come on Dylan we have to go\" His dad says loading up the car as he gets Rosie ready. He sighs before heading to the front of the house as everyone is there to say goodbye for a while. He saw Lily there but she was far away from the rest of them. He then walked up to her quietly \"Hey Lily\" He says quietly sitting right next to her on the little park bench \"Hi I'm sorry about what I said yesterday I just didn't know how to handle the news and all\" She says looking down ashamed \"It's okay but I'm gonna miss you like crazy I always do\" He says whispering the last part \"I'm going to miss you too alot\" \"I'll be back before you know it\" He says trying to brighten up the mood \"Yeah I guess you will promise you won't meet some pretty city girl while you're there\" She says laughing a little \"Wouldn't dream of it.

Hopefully I will get round to writing a decent length story unlike my gone fanfics. Sorry for any spelling/grammar. This is set a few weeks after the end of the film Enjoy. Dylan's POV: It had been 2 weeks since I told lily I loved her. It expected that we would start dating and stuff but we hadn't. Well we sort of were but it wasn't like it films or books we hadn't even kissed yet. We both felt like more than just friend though, atleast I did and i am pretty sure that lily felt the same way too. I kind of felt like I should kiss her to remind her that i loved her but it never felt like the right time. Her birthday was in a few weeks maybe I should wait till then, that would be romantic. Lily's POV: Dylan up in the attic as usual drawing something. He drew zoo animals and generally happier things now he had stopped drawing dark creepy stuff. \"Hey Dylan\". \"Hi\". \"What you drawing?\" I asked. \"Nothing\" he said hurriedly tilting his book away from me. But too slowly. \"How dare you call me nothing\" I replied. \"I would never call you nothing\" I sat down next to him and he put his arm round me \"you're the best thing that ever happened to me\". We sat in silence for while whilst I watched dylan draw. \"I wish I was going school with you on monday.\" \"No you don't. You don't know what public schools are like. Plus I will be new so I won't know anyone. I wish my dad would let me be homeschooled like you are\" \"I already asked he said public school would better for me or something like that.\" \"I'm sure it won't be as bad as you say and you will make some new friends.\" \"Well I am a very likeable person\" dylan laughed. I was going to say something clever back never got a chance. \"Dylan, Lily are you up there we need help putting the fence up around the new peacock garden\".[Chapter 2] This chapter is mostly just Dylan's thoughts I promise something more exciting will happen next chapter. Sorry for and spelling/grammar mistakes. I think I am getting better at spotting them tough. Dylan's POV: Finally school school was over. My dad was picking me up since it is far to far to walk or cycle and no busses came near the zoo because no one else lived anywhere near it. \"So how was school Dylan?\" My dad ask. \"Could have worse\" I replied. Dad asked me a few more parent questions about school. I wasn't really listening so I just grunted as a reply. My mind was on other things such as Lily. I really liked her and she definitely liked me back but I was worried that she might just think of me as just a friend and if that was the case then I could completely ruin our friendship. Also the next couple of years are going to hell if I don't make so proper friends soon. I had made a few new friends at school but i'm pretty sure they were just being nice to me since i was new. Other than that everything had been pretty bad, the school dinners were worse than my old school which until today i hadn't thought possible until today. LILY'S POV: I felt bad for Dylan having to go to school not knowing anybody and not wanting too. Kelly hadn't let me go to public school when I first came to live on the zoo because she said it was a waste of time driving there and back twice a day but now dylan's dad was taking dylan and rosie she didn't have an excuse since I could go with them so maybe she would let me now. Then dylan wouldn't be alone. === ONEISH WEEK LATER === DYLAN'S POV: I heard footsteps, then someone said \"Hey Dylan!\" It was Lily with a sandwich at half 4 as usual. \"Hi Lily\" I called back. \"Guess what?\" She said as she handed. Me my sandwich, \"Kelly finally agreed to let me go to normal school with you.\" \"Oh\" I replied. \"What's wrong don't you want me there?\" Lily asked. \"No it just I don't think you will enjoy it.\" ","Summary":" This is we bought a zoo fanfic if you haven't seen the movie I suggest you watch it because its is "},{"Movie":"We Bought a Zoo","Title":"Love Unexpected","Author":"Something Different 01","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10597974","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hi everyone it's Maddy here! I hope you guys enjoy my first story on this account, if you haven't read my other stories on my second account then just search Artemis's Daughter 01 or click the link in my bio. If you read my bio then it'll explain why I have two accounts and why this story is on my top priority. I hope you enjoy the first chapter of Love Unexpected! \"Mason hurry up!\" Kelly shouted from her car which she had parked at the curb of the school. I just huffed as I picked up my books that had dropped on the ground before running towards where she was parked and jumping in the back seat. \"What took you so long, I told you that you had to come to the zoo with me today.\" She said and I just shrugged as I looked out the window. There was no way in hell that I was going to tell her why I had spent more time than normal in that horrid place called school. You see, I had caught a glimpse of the new boy in my homeroom and I had instantly became curious as to who he was. I mean he was basically perfect in my book, he had messy brown hair that fell just over his eyes and he had the warmest brown eyes that I had seen in my entire life. He had that whole bad boy appearance to him but for some reason I knew that he wasn't really like that even though that's the vibe he radiated. Kelly had told me about him, apparently her new boyfriend was his dad, and her new boyfriend was the owner of the zoo that she worked at. I knew that they had moved into the house at the zoo in the beginning of summer, but today was the first day of school and it was the first I had seen of the elusive Mee family that Kelly talked so much about. \"You're gonna love these guys.\" She told me as we pulled into the driveway of the zoo. I had come here all the time before the Mee's moved in, but after they had taken residance at the zoo Kelly had gotten busier and I found myself sitting at home for basically the entire summer. Wishing that my cousin had the time to just take me to the zoo with her. \"Dylan's your age by the way.\" She said, even though it was information that I had received about twenty times before. \"Kelly you've told me this a million times.\" I muttered as I stepped out of the car and looked around at the familiar landscape of the zoo that I loved so much, \"I missed this place so much.\" I muttered and Kelly smiled as she reached into a bag that was sitting on the passenger seat and pulled out a khaki colored shirt. \"Here, you've basically grown up here, I think you'll be fine showing a few people around the place.\" She said and a huge smile spread across my face as I gently took the shirt from her hands and looked at it. Right on the name tag was my name stitched into the patch, this was real, and it was a dream come true. \"Come on, put it on quick and I'll introduce you to Benjamin and his kids.\" She said and I smiled as I shrugged the shirt on over my grey t-shirt and ran with her towards the actual zoo part of the property. \"Hey it's the mini Foster!\" I heard Robin shout and I smirked as I saw him and his monkey Crystal standing with Peter MacCreedy and a man that I didn't recognize. I assumed that was Benjamin considering his shirt had his name on it, but beside him as a little girl with curly red hair and the cutest smile int he world. \"We were wondering when you would be back.\" Robin said as I stopped beside him and I smiled as I looked around at the others. \"Hey it's not my fault Kelly wouldn't let me come this summer.\" I said, \"I'm Mason Foster, Kelly's cousin.\" I said as I saw Benjamin looking pretty confused as to who I was and he smiled as I finally gave him the information as to who I was. \"Nice to meet you, this is Rosie.\" He said and I smiled as I gave the little girl a wave. \"You wanna go see the peacocks?\" She asked excitedly and I laughed as I nodded and a huge smile spread across her adorable little face before she grabbed my hand and started running back towards the house where I saw a small pen set up. I thought I heard chirping coming from over there. \"I'll need you by the front gates in twenty minutes Mase!\" Kelly shouted and I gave her a thumbs up behind my back before running after Rosie. She was really excited about these peacocks wasn't she? \"This is peaches.\" Rosie said while leaning down and scooping up a tiny bird before showing her to me and I smiled as I gently ran a finger down the little birds head. I was so happy that the animals finally had someone to make their lives better, when there wasn't an owner to the zoo we barely got by on what we had. \"You're doing a great job taking care of them.\" I said as she sat down on the grass and let the little birds scurry around her. She sent me a smile before going back to laughing at the little birds who were running around her legs. \"You should meet my brother, he looks like he's your age.\" She said without looking up at me and I smiled before nodding, \"You would like him, he likes to draw to.\" she said and I raised an eyebrow at her as I wondered how she knew that I liked to draw, \"It's all over your arms, I thought it was really pretty.\" She said and I smiled as I looked down at my inked skin. Over the course of the day I had taken my sharpie that I had with me everywhere I went and started drawing this design that came to my mind. It was a design that looked like branches spreading from my wrist and up my forearm. I loved the look of it considering it was done in all black sharpie and had a tiny bird drawn in the branches. Kellly didn't like that I drew on myself all the time, but I always took a quick picture of it if I liked it and then scrubbed it off so there was no evidence of ink design that was on my skin. This one I was planning on keeping for a few days though, I loved it and it was some of my best work. \"Well then Rosie, would you like to introduce me to your brother?\" I asked and her eyes lit up as she nodded rapidly and hopped up on her feet, scaring the peacock chicks half to death, before stepping over the little wire fence and running off towards the zoo again. I couldn't help but laugh as I ran after her and towards the entrance to the zoo. \"Dylan!\" She shouted and I felt my stomach erupt in butterflies as she stopped in front of her brother who had a smile on his face as he saw his little sister, \"This is Kelly's cousin.\" She said excitedly and I smiled shyly as I stopped beside her and in front of Dylan who looked like he recognized me. \"You're in my grade aren't you?\" He asked and I nodded with a smile on my face, but instead of seeming disgusted that I was here, I don't know why I thought he would do that, he smiled, \"Cool, I'm Dylan.\" He said and I smiled as I shook his hand. \"I'm Mason.\" So there it is, I hope you guys like the first chapter and don't forget to REVIEW! and leave me your comments and your opinions because it helps me so much when you do tell me what you're thinking while reading these stories. New chapter will hopefully be up soon, thanks for reading![Chapter 2] So here it is, the second chapter to Unexpected Love. I hope you guys like it! And don't forget to REVIEW! at the end. \"So you really go to my school?\" Dylan asked as we walked down the path of the zoo towards the Lion's enclosure. We had a good ten minutes before the people came so it wasn't like we were in a mad dash to get everything ready in time. \"Yep, you're in my homeroom.\" I said and he raised an eyebrow at me and I just shrugged, \"I just remember you were in my homeroom, not many new kids come to our school.\" I said and he nodded before shoving his hands in my pocket, \"You're little sister's adorable.\" I said, trying to change the subject to somethin a little less awkward then me confessing that I saw him in our homeroom. \"Yah, she seems to really like you too, usually she's pretty shy around new people.\" He said and I smiled, well that felt nice, a little girl wasn't afraid of me. I guess there's a first for everything right? \"She kept on shouting look at your arm, what was that about?\" He asked with a laugh and I smirked as I held up my ink covered arm. \"She saw this and said that you like to draw too.\" I said and we stopped walking as he stared at the black lines that were on my skin. His hands gently took my wrist and I felt electricity run through my skin and make me shiver as he ran a finger down the smooth lines. \"It's not that good, I just got bored and decided to draw it.\" I said with a shrug and he scoffed before shaking his head. \"This is so cool, I can do small scenes and stuff, but I always mess things up if I draw them too big.\" He said and I smiled before noddiing in thanks. \"Well then maybe we can learn from each other, because the only surface I can draw on is my skin, and Kelly's not a big fan of that.\" I said with a laugh and he smiled beore nodding. \"But be warned, by the time I'm done with you, you won't be able to see your skin fully for a few weeks.\" I said and he smiled. \"That's a risk I'll have to take.\" He said before nodding his head in a motion for me to follow him, \"Usually the guests come through the front gates, but if you want to get a group of people to show around that isn't full of narcissitic egomaniacs, then you have to stand back a little.\" He said and I smiled as he stopped by one of the kite carts that was a little ways away from the entrance. \"What if I mess this up, I haven't been here in months.\" I said and he just shook his head as he looked over at the entrance where people were starting to pile in. \"If you know the grounds then you can do it, and if you're Kelly's cousin then you have to be a good guide.\" He said and I rolled my eyes as he gave me a quick smile before going off to talk to a group of people that looked a little lost. I took a deep breath and plastered a smile onto my face before walking up to a group of little kids all dressed in the same blue t-shirts. I knew that meant they were probably a school group or a day care group or something, so that shouldn't be too bad for me. As my first tour at least. \"Hello, and welcome to the Rosemoor Animal Park!\" I said excitedly and the little kids all seemed to light up as I stood in front of them, \"Are we ready to have some fun today!\" I asked excitedly and the kids all cheered as I smiled, \"Awesome, now just follow me and I'll show you all the cool places where you can see the animals.\" I said and the teachers who were with the kids just smiled at me as I seemed so excited. Honestly, I was excited. This was amazing! It's like I never left in the first place. \"How was your first day on the job?\" Kelly asked as I came back from my last group. I had been the one to get stuck with showing a group of old women around the zoo and let's just say that they don't walk very fast. So I ended up walking with them back to the entrance and waiting for them all to leave. \"I never want to show a group of old ladies around again.\" I said with a huff as I sat down in the living room of the Mee house and finally got to relax my aching feet. I loved the zoo, but that was a lot of walkng that I was not up for. \"Don't worry, you can always come work with me at the cafe.\" Lilly said and I smiled before nodding. Lilly was my other cousin that worked here at the zoo, technically I wasn't related to her since Kelly was my cousin on my mom's side and Lilly was her cousin on her dad's side, but that was just confusing. \"Hey Dylan.\" she suddenly aid and my eyes went wide as she sent a wink my way. Lilly and I had a bit of a discussion about Dylan when I was in between tours. I told her that he went to my school and that I did think he was cute, and she told me that I was head over heels in love with him. Which I wasn't. She told me that she had a crush on Dylan back when the zoo was being put back together and the Mee family moved in, but after that shocking piece of information that threatened to bring out the inner serial killer in me, she told me she was over it. Apparently him being fourteen almot fifth teen and in high school. And her being thirteen and homeschooled just didn't seem like a good combo. \"Hey Lilly, hey Mason.\" Dylan said while taking a seat beside me on the couch. I felt the familiar butterflies erupt in my stomach and I knew that it wasn't good that i was acting this way after knowig him for a day, \"You look exhausted.\" He said while looking over at me and I let out a sigh as I nodded. \"My feet are going to fall off.\" I said and he laughed as he shook his head. \"Don't worry you'll get used to it.\" Dylan promised and I sighed as I propped my feet up on the coffee table, \"You guys wanna watch a movie, Kelly and my dad won't get back from their rounds for a couple hours.\" He suggested and I looked over at Lllly with an eyebrow raised, obviously I couldn't go anywhere, but her room was here so it was really up to her. \"Nah I'm good, you two watch a movie though, I'll just be in my room.\" She said while sending me a wink, a wink that went unnoticed by Dylan as he just shrugged and grabbed the remote off the table and turned the TV on. But when he smiled and picked a movie I felt my entire body tense up, of course he picked a horror movie. \"You ok?\" He asked with a little laugh and I just gave him a nervous smile as I sunk down in my seat and tried to hide my face. \"Oh don't worry Mase, you have Dylan here to protect you.\" Lilly said with a laugh before leaving the room. I was honestly terrified, I hated scary movies because they reminded me of all the murders and serial killings that actually happened in the world, and that meant that I knew it could happen to me too. All together it just added up to one giant fear of scary movies. \"Relax Mason, i've watched this before, it's not that bad.\" Dylan said with a laugh and I sent a small glare his way before wrapping a blanket around my shoulders and huddling into the corner of the couch where I could hopefully hide from anything that popped up on the sceen. \"Hello?\" The girl in the movie asked. It was tweny minutes into the movie and I was already shaking I was so scared. Dylan, on the other hand, was basically laughing at me as I cowered in fear, he was like a fearless piece of brick. He didn't get scared. But when the girl went to open the door to her basement I knew something was going to happen, and even though I was completely prepared for it I still was scared to death when she opened the door and the grotesque face of a bloody clown came popping out. Before i had only let out little screams and yelps, but that was because I thought things were going to pop out, this was the first real thing to scare me, and I let out a real scream this time as I ducked down and hid my face in the blankets. \"Mase, you ok?\" Dylan asked and I peaked out from under my blanket to see him looking at me in actual concern. So I just shook my head and he frowned as he saw how scared I really was, \"Come on, I'm not stopping the movie but i'm not having you scream at everything.\" He said and i raised an eyebrow at him as he scooted over so he was sitting beside me. \"I'm not gonna bite.\" He said with a laugh and I just gave him a soft smile as I let the blanket go and folded into his arms that instnatly wrapped around me. I was surprised that he offered to hug me while the movie played, but I didn't have a chance to ask as I saw the demented bloody face of that clown pop up on the screen again. Before I could even scream Dylan's arms tightened around me and he gave me a small smile before pulling me closer to him so my head was on his shoulder. \"You ok?\" He whispered after another hour and I just nodded sleepily as I struggled to keep my eyes open. He gave me a small smile as I tried to stay awake, \"Come on, I think you need something to wake you up.\" He said and I jolted awake as he left his spot beside me and pulled me onto my feet. \"Wait one question, could this possibly get us arrested?\" I asked and he laughed before shaking his head and I rolled my eyes as I followed him out of the house and towards the zoo. \"Dylan, Mason, be back soon!\" I heard Benjamin shout and I knew that they had to be at the bar with the other staff members of the zoo. We had just walked past it and I could heard the laughter and the shouting coming from the open windows of the building. \"Got it dad!\" Dylan shouted and I saw Kelly smiling like an idiot as she looked at us through one of the windows. I just rolled my eyes at her before following Dylan off towards the zoo where the sounds of the animals settling down for the night was heard everywere you went, \"I found this place back when we were trying to find Buster in the summer.\" He said and I smiled. We walked through the paths of the zoo and I looked around in awe as I saw all the stars above us, you couldn't see stars like that in the city, that was for sure. He led me towards a cluster of trees at the very edge of the zoo and I instnatly got scared and nervous. He was leading me through the woods while it was dark, that's not necessarily a good thing to do after we just watched a movie where the main girl was attacked by a demented clown in a forest. \"Hey, it's ok.\" Dylan said as he saw me stop and I just shook my head as i took a step back and looked at the tall trees in front of me, \"Hey come here.\" He said and I just looked at him nervously as he offered his hand towards me. I gave him a smile as I grabbed his hand and he smiled as he started to lead me through the trees, \"I think you're gonna like this place.\" He said. \"Where are we going?\" I asked and he put a finger to his lis as he came behind me and put his hands over my eyes. I didn't feel the pine needles crunching under my feet anymore so I knew that we had to be in some sort of clearing, but as he got me to walk forward I grew even more nervous. \"Ok now look around.\" He said as he took his hands away from my eyes. I couldn't grasp any words as I looked around in awe. The clearing was all short soft grass that flowed gently with the soft breeze that was blowing through. The trees around us seemed to be blocking us off from the real world, but the most impressive sight was the crystal clear pond that was in front of us. There were tiny minnows swimming around in the water and the sunset that was almost gone made everything seem that much better. \"This place is amazing.\" I whispered and he smiled as he saw me lookinng around in shock, \"I'm serious Dylan, this place is perfect.\" I said and he shrugged as he looked at the beautiful scenery around him. \"It's pretty cool.\" He said and I nodded in agreement, \"I used to come out here just to get some alone time and do whatever I wanted, but now the zoo is open and school is starting so I'm probably not going to be able to come out here as often.\" He said with a frown and i gave him a reassuring smile as I put a hand on his shoulder. \"Well I promise that I'll make sure this place stays Dylan Mee's secret hide out.\" I said and he smiled a genuine smile. It wasn't like he was laughing at me becuase I was scared, or he was just showing that cute smirk of his, this was a real smile. And I loved it on him. \"Thanks for coming.\" He said with a smile. \"Thanks for inviting me.\" So there it is, I hope you guys like it and don't forget to REVIEW! and leave your opinions because I love it when you do! Love you guys! ","Summary":" Hi everyone it's Maddy here! I hope you guys enjoy my first story on this account, if you haven't r"},{"Movie":"We Bought a Zoo","Title":"The Silent Killer","Author":"HorcruxCupcake","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9612059","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The sun was shining and making the raindrops from the night glisten before they evaporated off into their warm surroundings. Flowers whistled in the breeze while bees hovered around them trying to get the last of the sweet tasting honey, and everything was perfect. Thud, went the ball as it slammed into Dylan's arms, he grasped it into my firm grip and sent it spinning through the air like a shuttle speeding through space. His little sister jumped high but the ball overshot her and landed right at the top of the hill, they both watched as it started rolling down the hill, the giant mountainous hill that lead down into the valley below. It was quite a long way down and even if they started chasing it now the ball would reach the bottom before they reached it. \"You go and get it, you should have caught it.\" Dylan exclaimed. \"No you threw it, you should get it!\" The argument went on for quite a long time, until their dad who had obviously been listening to the argument yelled over \"For God's sake both of you go and get it!\" So we started going down the hill. Down and down and down we went, until we were half way there. \"I'm tired\" Rosie, Dylan's little sister, complained and she flung herself onto the floor and started to feign sleep. \"Come on, we're almost at the bottom now.\" he lied. \"No were not\" she replied \"…and after we have got to the bottom we have to climb back up.\" \"Alright, if you're going be a girl about it.\" He knew that would stir a reaction from her, and sure enough she got up straight away and said \"The only girl around here is you\". Everyone always says that if you still want to be in one piece the next day, never call Rosie weak, or imply it. 'Hopefully she'll be too tired when we get home and then she'll forget about the insult, so should I be safe' thought Dylan as he followed Rosie down the hill. She soon ran up to him with the ball and screamed as she ran past \"Last one up is a lo-ser!\". \"You're on!\" he yelled back, and his advantage of longer legs meant he was soon streaming past her at full speed. Dylan reached the top and looked down; Rosie had got quite a way to go and seeing he had beaten her she slowed to a walk. He flopped down on the cool grass and waited still trying to gain his breath. He could hear his parents' voices in the distance and at first he tried not to listen but eventually it became inevitable. \"When I came back from the doctors this morning I told you nothing was wrong. Well that wasn't exactly true.\" Catherine said lying in the arms of her husband. \"Why what's wrong?\" Benjamin asked suddenly all worried. \"Ok well I don't want to worry you and I'll be fine, I didn't tell you this morning because I didn't want the kids to find out. But I have lung cancer.\" \"What?\" Catherine explained to Benjamin everything she had been told at the doctors and while they had this conversation, Dylan was crouching down peering through the bushes listening. He felt guilty because he wasn't supposed to find out but when that feeling started to wear off he only felt frustration because he thought he had a right to know. \"How serious is it? How long have you had it for?\" Benjamin asked \"Not long and I'm going to be fine, the doctors said it can be cured and I've got to start my treatment in the next couple of days so we'll just have to wait and see what happens.\" Catherine replied as she turned to look at him. He leant forwards and pressed a kiss to her forehead \"Nothing is going to happen, you'll recover in no time and I'm going to be with you the whole way. I promise.\" After that Dylan didn't get to here anymore of his parents' conversation because Rosie had caught up with him and was running past saying \"I'm going to beat you to mum and dad!\" He followed her slowly not bothering to run; he was no longer in the mood to play games and just wanted to go home. \"Hi you two, are you alright?\" Catherine said as her kids approached her. \"Yeah, I'm bored can we go back home now?\" \"If you want, we were going to hire some bikes and cycle around the park on one of the trails\" \"I'm not really bothered\" \"Aww!\" moaned Rosie \"I want to go biking, you're so boring Dylan.\" \"Whatever I'm just going to wait in the car.\" And he turned around and started walking over to the car. As he got inside he couldn't stop fresh tears falling from his eyes as realisation hit him. Being alone with his thoughts was probably worse than being with his family and pretending like nothing happened. Back on the field Rosie was complaining about Dylan saying \"he always spoils everything\" but Catherine was only half listening because she was watching her son and she knew something was bothering him. \"Don't worry darling, we'll go biking some other time, ok?\" said Benjamin trying to calm Rosie down. \"Hold on, you wait here I'm just going to talk to Dylan\" said Catherine. Benjamin nodded in reply and she got up and walked over to the car. When she reached it she looked in through the back window and saw Dylan curled up and crying with his back towards to door, she tapped on the window so he knew she was there and he jumped up startled hastily trying to wipe the tears from his cheeks. \"Hey what's the matter\" Catherine said as she opened to door and sat down on the back seat Dylan looked at her with tear filled eyes and said \"Promise you won't get mad?\" Catherine shook her head \"no, why?\" she asked softly in reply. He looked down at his lap as he spoke not wanting to see her face \"I heard you and dad talking a minute ago before Rosie came back up the hill.\" When she said nothing he looked up at her face and said \"I'm sorry I didn't mean to, I just heard.\" \"I know, I'm not mad, I just… I didn't want you to find out like that; you had a right to be told properly.\" She pulled him into a hug and he cried into her arms \"I don't want you to go\" \"Hey ssh come on, I'm not going anywhere. The doctors said there is a perfectly good chance of full recovery so don't write me off just yet\" she smiled trying to lighten the atmosphere. Neither of them noticed Benjamin and Rosie walking up to the car and they both jumped when the car door opened \"We were wondering where you were and if you're coming biking.\" He stopped noticing his wife and son had both been crying \"Are you all right?\" \"Dylan overheard us talking when Rosie was fetching the ball\" \"Oh\" he said \"Do you want to just get home and we can talk about it more then?\" Catherine nodded and got out of the back of the car so Rosie could climb in who had stopped whinging and was now wondering what on earth was going on. She didn't say anything because she knew it must be serious because Dylan was crying and he would never be seen dead crying under normal circumstances. Benjamin started the engine and the Mee family drove home in silence not knowing what to say to each other. Catherine was worried because although she'd told her husband and son that the statistics of full recovery were promising she knew they weren't and she just hoped that Dylan and Rosie would be alright without her. She knew what it was like to grow up without a mother and she wished she didn't have to put her children through that ordeal. At last the family pulled up on their drive and started to clamber out of the car, unfortunately there was someone already stood on the doorstep. \"Bloody hell\" Catherine whispered under her breath. \"What?\" Benjamin asked as he had clearly not seen the figure standing waving at them or the six people who were walking from the back of the house, looking to see if anybody was home. \"What's my mother doing here?\" He looked up and sighed, he knew the last people Catherine wanted to see right now were her relatives from England and the bags they were carrying looked as though they had come to stay for quite a while. He walked to the boot and started to pull out the picnic rug and box with the leftover food in. Rosie noticing her cousins jumped out and ran over to them giving everyone a hug. \"I've missed you auntie Rebecca\" said Rosie as her aunt lifted her up \"I've missed you too Rosie, look how grown up you are, you were only four when I last saw you\" Rosie smiled as Rebecca put her down realising that she was heavier than she looked. Catherine waited until Benjamin had got the bag out of the boot (taking as long as possible) and then they walked up the drive onto the porch with Dylan trailing behind. \"Hello Catherine, said Margaret as she pulled her into a hug\" \"Hi mum, what are you all doing here?\" \"Visiting you of course. It's the summer holidays for the kids and we haven't seen you in ages so we thought we'd come and surprise you!\" \"Oh great…that's wonderful\" Catherine said as she plastered a false smile across her face. Margaret didn't notice her daughter's hesitation and soon the whole family were seated in the living room which consisted of Catherine; Benjamin; Dylan; Rosie; Margaret and Peter, Catherine's parents; Rebecca, her sister; James, her brother-in-law and Rebecca and James' three children: Jessica, Joe and Tom. ' Why did we buy such a big house and invite them to stay whenever they wanted?' Catherine thought as she sipped her tea, one of the reasons they had moved to America was to get away from her family. Lovely as they were they seemed to annoy Catherine very easily and today was really not the best day for them to show up on their doorstep announcing that they will be staying with them in America for the next six weeks. This also meant that she would have to tell her family about the cancer, she probably would have done eventually of course but now they were going to find out virtually straight away and this was much sooner than she would have liked. Now she was going to have to put up with her mother constantly fussing over her and her sisters worried glances not to mention her father who would most likely want to accompany her to every treatment procedure. \"Dylan you're very quiet tonight, you used to never shut up\" said James as the conversation died down. \"I'm just tired\" Dylan said \"I think I'm just going to go to bed\" \"Alright, it's been a long day\" said Benjamin and Dylan got up and gave his mother a hug before he went upstairs. As he did so Catherine quietly whispered in his ear so no one but Benjamin sitting next to her could hear \"It's going to be alright, you know.\" \"Yeah, I love you\" \"I love you too, nigh nigh.\" Dylan gave his mum a smile and trailed off upstairs. To anybody else in the room it looked as though Dylan was giving Catherine a normal bedtime hug but Rosie knew different and was too young to realise that Catherine didn't want the rest of her extended family to know anything yet. \"Why was Dylan upset earlier?\" she asked looking at her mum and dad. \"He was just worried about something, it doesn't matter now though\" replied Benjamin \"I think it's time you went to bed too missy, it's getting late\" he stood up and put her on his shoulders and she giggled as he went out of the room and took her upstairs. After that everyone sorted sleeping arrangements out and traipsed upstairs to bed, but Margaret hadn't forgotten what Rosie had said even though making them forget had clearly been Benjamin's objective. She intended to find out the reason why Dylan had been upset because, despite what Benjamin had said, from the way Dylan went and gave Catherine a hug it did matter to him. \"Are you ok?\" Benjamin asked as him and Catherine climbed into bed. \"I'm as ok as I'm ever going to be with my mother and father in this house.\" Replied Catherine exasperatedly, she turned to look at Benjamin and sighed \"Yes, I'm fine you don't need to worry.\" \"I always worry\" he said as he lay down and turned onto his sighed. Catherine smiled and lay down behind him putting her arm around him \"You don't need to worry any more than normal then.\" Catherine drifted off to sleep, but Benjamin couldn't stop thinking about everything that had happened and everything that was going to happen. As the hour hand on the clock ticked over to 2 he slowly sat up so as not to wake Catherine and got out of bed as quietly as he could. He just needed to calm himself down so he went downstairs and made himself a cup of tea. Little did he know that was someone else I the house who couldn't sleep either. Margaret, hearing someone going downstairs, got out of bed and walked down to the kitchen; entering the room she saw her son-in-law absentmindedly stirring the tea bag round in the milk while he waiting for the tea to mash. He didn't notice here presence to start with so she cleared her throat to make herself known. \"Oh hi\" Benjamin said \"You couldn't get to sleep either?\" \"Probably jet lag\" Margaret smiled \"Do you want a cup of tea?\" Benjamin asked even though he was already getting another cup out of the cupboard. \"Yes please\" When the tea had been poured they sat in silence for a minute or two sipping at their tea until Margaret asked \"Is everything alright with Dylan, only Rosie said he was upset earlier.\" Benjamin hesitated before replying carefully \"He's just had a lot going on, he'll be fine.\" \"He'll be fine; I thought you said it didn't matter anymore?\" \"Well…It doesn't, he just needs time to clear his head.\" \"Oh, well I can talk to him if you want.\" Benjamin was now realising what Margaret was trying to do and find out some gossip so starting to get annoyed he replied \"No it's alright, we were going to talk about it when we got back but…\" \"Oh so this something you don't want us to know? What has he done? Or isn't it that bad and you just don't want to tell us purely out of spite!\" \"Not everything is about you Margaret.\" \"I never said that it was, I just don't understand why you won't tell us things, Rebecca and James keep us informed.\" \"Good for them.\" \"I still don't understand why you had to move over here\" \"Look I don't mean to be rude when I say this but it's really not any of your business, and you've got no right to know.\" After that huffing and puffing Margaret climbed upstairs to bed. Next morning at breakfast the tension in the air between Benjamin and Margaret was high and Catherine was wondering what had happened last night that she didn't know about. Margaret was clearly sick of Benjamin and the dirty looks he kept on giving her so she decided to take matters into her own hands and ask Dylan outright \"Dylan, are you doing drugs?\" \"What?!\" Dylan spluttered into his cereal as the whole table looked up at either Margaret or Dylan. \"Where on earth would you get that idea?\" asked Catherine loudly Margaret didn't answer so Benjamin did for her \"She thinks that was the reason Dylan was upset yesterday.\" \"What is your problem!\" said Dylan standing up \"Mum clearly doesn't want you to know why I was upset so don't go trying to work it out by asking stupid questions like that!\" and he stormed out of the room. \"I got it\" said Benjamin and he followed Dylan out of the kitchen and into the living room closing the door behind him. \"Well, I know when I'm not wanted\" said Margaret her head held high, while she stood up and went of the other kitchen door leading outside. \"Is everything ok, did we turn up at a bad time?\" Rebecca asked her sister concerned. \"No you're all alright, I just wasn't ready to put up with mum yesterday and clearly Dylan wasn't either.\" \"Well if there is anything you need.\" Catherine nodded \"Thanks\" Benjamin then walked back in the room and said \"He's alright. Rosie wants to know what's going on now though as well\" he picked up his glass and bowl and put it in the dishwasher. Catherine rubbed her eyes with her hand and sighed \"Ok, alright\" she said softly and quietly, and with that she too left the room leaving everyone who was still sitting down in the kitchen entirely confused.[Chapter 2] A/N: Ok so I re-wrote this chapter 4 times because I wanted to show Margaret's side of the story but without getting rid of the 'my mother is so annoying' view. I have never been involved in any of the issues in this story so I find it hard to empathise with the characters but I try to make them realistic. So everything in here is just from what I've read (or watched on the TV). Oh and I don't really know anything about cancer either other than from what I've read so I'm sorry if doesn't really make sense. I think I should tell you that I've raised the rating T because of mentions of domestic abuse in this chapter, but you're supposed to be 13 or over if you're on this site anyway. I also realised that I've been spelling Katherine's name with a C instead of a K (I blame it on my friend because I'm so used to writing her name with a C) anyway I've changed it in the summary but I'm not going to change all of chapter 1 sorry :p In reply to Dntgkad - Don't worry I'm not going to turn this into a Dylan and Lily story, I honestly don't really like them together anyway, but I am going to keep Catherine alive for a little while so I'll just see where the story goes. You did sort of give me the idea for this though so thanks :D. Enjoy :) Later that day, Margaret had come back into the house and stormed upstairs without saying a word. Benjamin had thought this was extremely rude considering that it was their house she was staying in but Katherine hadn't said anything so he thought he'd let it go. He knew she was under a lot of stress and he didn't want to make the problem worse. Katherine was sitting on her bed in her room contemplating what to do when she heard her mother arrive. She ignored her not even wanting to look at her, she didn't deserve the right to know what was going on from the way she had behaved Katherine's entire life, but Rosie did. Her daughter was only just 6 and she couldn't leave her. She needed a mum. But if she was to have her mum taken away from her, she at least deserved to know why and what was happening even if she wouldn't fully understand everything. Benjamin walked into the room. Katherine could see he was trying to keep calm for her but really it was killing him to see her like this. However, Benjamin honestly didn't know how much longer he could last. It had only been one day since he found out about the cancer and the idea had been slowly eating him up. It didn't make the matter better that Margaret was here either. He knew that Katherine loved her deep down, she just tried to hide it and however hard he tried to get her to admit it she never would. \"Do you think we should tell her?\" he asked \"Rosie?\" \"No, I meant your mother.\" \"Are you serious?\" she said turning to look at him \"Well she's going to find out eventually, maybe you should just tell her. Then she won't be acting like this and…\" he hesitated before he continued \"…you'll probably feel less guilty if you tell her.\" \"Guilty. You think I feel guilty!\" she said raising her voice as she stood up \"I will never feel guilty for anything to do with that woman! She is the one who should feel guilty, not me. She doesn't have the right to know anything about my life and especially not this.\" \"You don't mean that\" he said calmly. \"Oh don't I?\" \"Why do you always seem to isolate yourself whenever she's around?\" he cried \"It wouldn't be so bad but you distance yourself from me, Dylan and Rosie as well. It's like you don't want to let any of us in!\" \"Maybe I don't\" she said coolly \"They're your children\" he muttered turning away \"And considering that you're my husband you should know by now that I tell you everything! So don't you dare say that I don't\" \"I'm not doing, you just seem to bottle things up whenever your mother's here. If she wasn't here neither of us would be so stressed, and that would be much better for you considering the circumstances\" \"Oh I'm sorry, do you want to tell her to leave or shall I.\" \"I'm not saying it's your fault that she's here it's just really bad timing. I just think you should open up to her\" \"Just because she gave birth to me doesn't give her the right to know this. She gave that role away years ago and she hasn't earnt it back. She isn't my mother! She didn't want to know me at birth so why should she want to know me now! What is so different about this time in my life?\" \"Well in case you haven't noticed there might not be chance to change things if…\" he faltered \"You did not just say that\" she said hurt flashing across her face and he realised that was just what she didn't want him to say. \"Look I'm sorry,\" he said lowering his voice again with a lot of willpower \"But it could happen and you know it. You're probably closer to believing it than me anyway.\" Katherine looked as though she wanted to say something but changed her mind. \"Look all I'm asking you to do, is give her another chance. You owe it to yourself and she might have changed.\" If anything that angered Katherine even more \"She didn't want me then and she still doesn't want me now! People don't change!\" she stormed out of the room and into the bathroom where she locked the door and sat down on the cold hard floor, letting the tears that had been threatening to fall all day finally come crashing down. Unfortunately for Katherine during the argument her voice had carried and although nobody downstairs had heard the yelling, for the people on the second floor it was a whole different story. Dylan had come upstairs after breakfast and he had not been downstairs since, he was sitting at his desk trying to clear his mind by drawing, when he heard his mum and dad's voices. However Dylan was not the only person who was upstairs at the current time. The women who had been the cause of the argument had heard everything and was now sitting down on her bed feeling extremely uncomfortable. She did want her daughter and she thought Katherine knew that but things had just been so difficult back then. Benjamin knocked on the bathroom door \"Katherine, I'm sorry. Are you okay?\" he asked. There was no answer so he tried again \"Look I'm sorry, I just got fed up with her and I know you're tired of the way she's been acting.\" Still nothing \"We don't have to tell her.\" Then unexpectedly came the sound of Katherine's voice from the other side of the door \"I know\" she said \"I'm not bothered about that\" Benjamin sighed \"I know and I'm sorry for what I said, I really didn't mean it like that, but it's all going to be ok in the end\" he said quietly, unsure of what else to say. \"Not that, it's weird that doesn't seem to be bother me that much at the moment. It'll probably hit me when it all starts happening for real.\" Then in answer to his unasked question she said \"It's just my stupid mother again\" The door lock clicked to signal Katherine had opened it. He pushed it open and saw her sitting there against the wall facing the door; tears streaming down her face. \"Come here\" he said sitting down next to her and pulling her into a hug. They sat like that for a few moments, with her crying into his shoulder, until she pulled back. \"I'm sorry\" she said wiping her eyes. \"Don't be silly\" he said stroking her hair. \"I just wish that she would tell me why. I mean she kept Rebecca and I know she's four years younger than me but… I don't know. When she took me back in when I was twelve she always used it against me. Whenever I did anything wrong she said she was glad that she got rid of me and that she was stupid for even considering letting me live with her again. It was only because of my dad…\" Benjamin just sat there quietly letting her rant and rave about her mother. Next minute they heard footsteps coming down the landing to the bathroom. The door was still open so Margaret saw them straight away. \"Katherine can I talk to you for a moment please\" she said. Katherine just nodded and Benjamin kissed her on the forehead before standing up and leaving the bathroom. Katherine made no move to speak so Margaret pulled a hankie out of her pocket. \"Here\" she said holding the hankie out for Katherine to take. \"What do you want?\" she asked refusing to take it. Margaret sighed \"I..I wanted to apologise\" \"Yeah well it's a bit late for that\" \"Well I want to chance to try\" \"I don't think you deserve the chance\" \"No I probably don't\" \"How do you even know what we were talking about anyway?\" Margaret did have the grace to look uncomfortable \"I heard you and Ben arguing\" \"His name's Benjamin, and if you involved yourself in my life more without tab hanging, you would know that.\" \"I wasn't tab hanging\" Katherine just gave her a look that said 'clearly you were' so she quickly changed the subject. \"Look, I wanted to tell you why I didn't keep you.\" \"I already know why; you've told me. You were really young and I was, and would have been, a hindrance\" \"That's not the real reason and you know it\" Katherine didn't say anything so Margaret continued \"It's really hard to love a child when you hate the man who got you pregnant in the first place\" \"What?\" Katherine questioned, shock taking over from her stubbornness. Margaret turned her back to Katherine and pulled her top up. Beneath the t-shirt was a huge scar running from her shoulder blade down to her opposite hip. \"Oh my God\" gasped Katherine \"Dad did that to you\" she said her eyes wide. \"Sort of\" Margaret said turning back round \"Peter didn't do this to me if that's what you mean but yes your dad did\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I left your father when I found out I was pregnant with you. We weren't married, so one day I just left without one look back. I couldn't let him hurt you.\" Katherine just sat there trying to take it all in. \"I was only 17 and I didn't know what to do\" Margaret continued \"So yes my mother, your grandma, encouraged me to give you up. She knew that most of the caring would fall onto her shoulders and she didn't want that responsibility at her age. \"You have to know that I wanted to keep you, I really did. But the pain and hardships of the pregnancy just kept weighing down on my shoulders. I had no support and I knew it wasn't fair to you to raise you without a father. I just I didn't seem to feel anything for you and I'm…I'm so sorry\" Her voice cracked and tears streamed down her face. \"I thought it might change when you were born. You know that first time when you hold your child and the whole pregnancy and hardships and heartache is all worth it, but it never came\" she lowered her voice to a whisper \"I felt nothing, I just felt emotionless. Well nothing good I mean, you look so much like your dad it scared me and I…\" \"I was just a child\" \"I know, I know and I'm so sorry\" \"And you only took me back in because Peter wanted you to.\" \"Yes. I mean you know how I treated you and you didn't deserve any of it but I made it clear that if I'd had the choice I would have left you where you were. Partly because I knew you'd hate me and I was a coward; I didn't want to face that. But partly because after 12 years I'd built a new and happy life for myself and I didn't want to be reminded of the demons from my past.\" Katherine nodded \"Why didn't you ever tell me?\" \"You were happy to have a dad, Peter I mean. I told you that he had no say when I gave you up for adoption and you didn't see him as evil like you saw me.\" \"I never thought you were evil.\" \"Maybe not but I was always the bad guy. I didn't like it, no but you'd just been given a family, even if it was just a father and a sister, it was more than you'd had before. I couldn't take that away from you.\" They sat in silence for a moment before Katherine spoke \"Thank you\" \"What for?\" \"For actually caring, I never realised.\" \"Oh darling I'm sorry. I always cared about you really. I couldn't not, you're my daughter.\" She pulled Katherine into a long awaited hug. \"Mum?\" \"Yeah\" \"Why…why did Tom do what he did?\" \"He just got angry at me for things\" \"Like what?\" then seeing her mother's reluctance she said \"I'm sorry you don't have to tell me, it doesn't matter\" \"You're right it doesn't matter, which means I should be able to talk about it. He had a lot of other encounters, shall we say, with other women. I noticed and I confronted him about it. He said I was too nosy for my own good and then it went on from there. I only confronted him that once of course, but when he realised what he could do to me, he didn't seem to want to stop.\" \"I'm sorry\" \"It's alright, I should have kept my nose out of others people's business\" \"Well it was your business as well; I mean he cheated on you. If Benjamin ever did anything like that to me I would do more than confront him.\" \"Oh I heard the way you yelled at him just then, poor bloke\" Margaret laughed lightening the sullen atmosphere. \"Tom was right about one thing though\" Katherine said \"What?\" \"You are too nosy for you own good\" Katherine smiled \"Hey\" \"Oh come on, would we be having this conversation if you weren't?\" \"I wasn't tab hanging you just shout very loud.\" Margaret said \"So am I forgiven?\" The happiness vanished from Katherine's face \"Mum…\" \"No I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything. Me and my big mouth again.\" \"No it's not that. It's just…\" \"I've broke past the first barrier but I still need to work on the other ninety-nine.\" Katherine looked at her \"You felt like you had no one who cared as a child\" Margaret explained \"Benjamin's right you do block people out, especially those who should have been close to you. Can we just at least try to be a family?\" Katherine shook her head not knowing how to say or do anything else. \"I already have my family; it takes longer than half an hour to add a new member.\" She stood up then a look of realisation crossed her face \"Oh my God\" she said \"you're unbelievable.\" Margaret looked at her with an innocent expression on her face \"Oh come on don't look like that,\" said Katherine \"You said all that just to get some gossip on what's going on in your daughter's life - it probably wasn't even true. All that just to find out exactly why Benjamin wanted me to talk to you and to have that conversation that I 'owe to myself' .\" \"It was true Katherine, you have to believe that\" \"Yeah, well I hate to break it to you but you don't just get the title of 'mother'. You have to earn it.\" With that she walked out of the bathroom leaving Margaret behind alone looking dazed. Katherine was right she did have her family and her family deserved to know the truth. Rosie was sitting in a chair in the living room reading whilst Benjamin was on the settee on his laptop. \"Rosie can me and dad talk to you a minute please\" she said looking at her husband \"Yeah\" she said closing her book \"We'll go into the sun room. No one can hear us in there\" \"Okay\" she said slowly and uneasily \"It's alright you've not done anything wrong\" A look of relief flashed across her face \"Or have you and you don't want us to know?\" asked Benjamin \"No\" Rosie said a little too quickly. Benjamin rolled his eyes thinking was his mischievous daughter could possibly have done this time, but decided to let it slide. He could do with a good laugh anyway. They walked into the sun room and they sat down on the settee, Katherine pulling Rosie onto her lap. She was about to say something but then she froze, not sure how to start. So Benjamin started the conversation. \"Rosie you know we both love you, don't you\" Rosie nodded \"Well you have to know that no matter what happens we will always be with you. Even if we have to go far away we will always love you and we will always be with you in here\" he said pointing at her heart. \"Far away…you're getting a divorce aren't you?\" she said turning her head to her mother's chest \"No, no Rosie we aren't getting a divorce. What gave you that idea anyway?\" \"Chloe at school said her mum and dad got a divorce because they were arguing all the time\" \"Well your mum and I don't argue all the time\" \"Dylan said you were arguing earlier\" \"Did he now?\" said Benjamin frustratingly. \"Well we weren't really arguing, I was just a bit annoyed with grandma that's all\" said Katherine \"Ok\" Rosie frowned \"So why are you going far away?\" \"Well your mum has got a horrible bug inside of her and it might send her away for a while\" \"Like a poorly bug\" \"Yes\" \"But mum's not poorly\" she said \"When I'm poorly I have to lie down because I feel faint when I walk around\" Katherine laughed \"Yeah you're right, I'm not very poorly now, but I might get really ill eventually\" \"But then you'll get better\" said Rosie, her parents hesitated \"Won't you?\" she added close to tears \"Yeah she will Rosie\" he said. \"Good\" said Rosie jumping off her mother's lap and giving her a hug \"I'm sorry you're poorly. Is this why Dylan was upset?\" \"Yeah it is\" \"Oh ok, but you'll get better. I think he was just making a big deal out of nothing.\" She declared skipping off. Benjamin laughed humourlessly \"What a sensitive little girl\" Katherine just put her head in her hands \"I hate lying to her\" \"Well we weren't really lying to her. You are going to make a full recovery\" he said putting his arm around her, as if trying to convince himself. \"But if I don't…\" \"Katherine you will. I know what I said earlier but I was being stupid, I mean you can't…not\" he said not wanting to think about any other possibilities. \"You were right with what you said earlier and with those figures and statistics-\" she stopped suddenly, realising she'd gone too far. \"What do you mean?\" \"My chances of recovery\" \"Yeah but, you told me they were high. Katherine? When you say statistics…the recovery rate is high isn't it?\" \"Well my chances of survival aren't exactly low compared to others but … 16% of people survive\" she whispered. \"And you're going to be one of them. It's probably because most people who get it are old and they've been smoking all their lives\" he felt like he was telling himself these lies to cover up the truth. \"Benjamin don't be ridiculous and stop trying to ignore that facts. It's a fairly new branch of cancer and they're still in experimental stages\" she said. Benjamin shook his head \"It doesn't matter; you are going to recover despite the figures and statistics and everything else. You're strong and healthy; you're going to be fine.\" Katherine looked at her husband directly in the eye. She grasped his hand and said what should have been said from the start \"Benjamin, I'm going to die.\" A/N: Hope you enjoyed it, do you think my chapters are too long?

Like most of my works, actually. I started this back in August when I got back from America because the film was on whilst I was on the plane but I know if I don't post this soon I'll never do it. The title comes from Avril Lavigne's song Slipped Away. Please read and review xx For a while, Kelly didn't know why Benjamin was taking Spar's death so much to heart. Sure she loved the tiger and missed him terribly - as if she'd lost a child of her own, but she couldn't figure out why Benjamin cared so much. He was a very nice man, very compassionate, but to him this was probably still just a zoo. He'd only just bought it, and seemingly on a whim. So why did he care? Why so much? She thought back. It took quite a while but she remembered some of the comments Benjamin had shouted when they'd first found out about Spar's illness. When he'd said he couldn't watch it again. That implied he'd already watched it happen once. What had happened? For a moment she wondered about it - feeling sorry for intruding on whatever was troubling him, but too worried to care. After a few minutes the obvious answer - the only answer - came to her in a flash and she berated herself for being so oblivious before. She needed to speak to him about his wife. 'This was a disaster waiting to happen,' she thought as she failed yet again to mange to get Benjamin to talk. He had started avoiding the mere sight of her and her temper was building, even though she knew he didn't owe her any kind of answer. She couldn't help her curiosity - or her concern.. She tried to discretely bring his wife up in casual conversation but Benjamin seemed to actively avoid all mentions of her, giving credence to Kelly's theory. It was after six days of avoidance that Kelly finally decided to be upfront with her queries. She waited until he was in the pen with the tapirs so he couldn't easily escape and the kids were both at school so that they didn't catch any of this by accident. That wouldn't be fair. \"What happened to your wife?\" she started. Having not heard her come up behind him, he stilled. He then redoubled his efforts, ignoring her once again. \"What happened?\" she repeated. Benjamin sighed slightly and then turned his back further on her. Kelly didn't ask again, merely perching on the fence, waiting. She didn't know whether he'd answer but for some reason she thought he might. Maybe he needed someone to talk to. It didn't seem like he had yet and she knew something about keeping stuff close to the chest. He'd want to talk - eventually, even if it wasn't today. All she needed was a little bit of patience. \"She died.\" Kelly didn't say anything but the blunt suddenness of what she was hearing almost startled her off the fence. She thought he might talk but she hadn't expected an answer as upfront as that, never mind so quickly. She shook of the thoughts quickly and repositioned herself on the fence to prevent herself from falling backwards. Benjamin seemed to notice she was no longer giving him all of her attention but rather than clamming up, he gave her a chance to reseat herself before continuing with his train of thought. \"She died of cancer.\" Kelly still didn't speak. \"I watched her drift away. Until she was barely more than a shadow of what she used to be. She spent the last weeks of her life on a hospital bed, not in her home at the grand old age of ninety six. She didn't have the strength to do anything, to move, to speak. It was an effort for her to tell her she loved us. Rosie barely remembers her.\" This time Kelly simply didn't know what to say. What did you say to something like that? Beyond the public condolences and expected social customs, what did you do ? \"Why did you ask? What did you want to know? Why did you want to know?\" Benjamin sounded as close to distress as she's ever heard him, not in hysteria or panic, but sadness. He sounded close to tears and Kelly didn't know what to do about it. \"I...I...Spar...\" Her mouth opened and closed wordlessly, probably looking like a goldfish but right now she didn't care because she didn't know what to say. She didn't know what she had expected when she'd come down here, even though she'd had her suspicions. This was more than she'd expected, far more. Benjamin gave her a look emotioneless look before putting down the bucket, ignoring the crash it makes when it clattered to the floor, and strode out of the pen, away from her, until he was just a spot on the horizon. He didn't look back.[Chapter 2] I decided to add Benjamin's POV to this - I hope you like it x Please read and review :) He knew he'd said too much straight away, from the speculative look on Kelly's face as soon as the words fell out of his mouth. He hadn't been able to stop himself from saying it, no matter how much it hurt to say it aloud. Because whenever he looked at Spar all he could see was the last time this had happened, his wife leaving him and their children behind. He couldn't have that now, not now that he was so attached to Spar and especially not when his daughter loved him like her own family. It would be like losing her all over again. And that hurt so much. It was why he'd bought the zoo after all, to do something as crazy as she always did, to do something impulsively - the kind of thing he couldn't usually do. Like buy a zoo on a casual whim. That reminds him of his wife and all the pain that comes with it, especially now that Spar is dying. Only now he's mentioned it, Kelly is going to want to know, and he knows that Kelly isn't the kind of person to give up. It's all going to be unearthed and scratched at, until it's brought to the surface. And he can't deal with that right now. So he runs. ","Summary":" I don't even know where this came from...

All rights go to Poison! Two months; that's how long its been since the break up. Three days ;since I found out he has had a girlfriend for the last month and a half. Two days; since I decided that I never meant anything to him. One day; the amount of time I've been listening to Every Rose Has It's Thorn on repeat. I also decided that I was going to cover it at my concert tonight. I was half way through the song when my headphones were viciously ripped from my ears. It was my best friend Miley Cyrus. \"What?\" I asked, probably a bit more rudely than needed, but I was still depressed. She sighed and sat down next to me. \"Taryn, it's been two months , you need to just get over him already.\" she said softly. I shook my head. \"It's not that simple Miles. Josh and I were together, for three years . It's going to take me more than two months to get over him. Especially when I find out that he obviously didn't care that much about me, if he was already dating again, half a month after the break up.\" Miley shook her head. \"You know that's not true.\" she argued. I sat up straighter. \"Do I? Do I really? Because taking in all the evidence and all that happened between us, it's hard to believe that he did love me.\" I said angrily before getting up and storming to the stage area. I looked out and saw the crowd was waiting anxiously for me to go on. Miley wasn't touring with me, she had just come to see me because this, L.A, was my last stop before I went to Europe where I was going to tour with One Direction for a month. I had about five minutes before I went on and I decided to get a water and listen to a quick song to get me pumped up. I pulled my iPod back out and started scrolling through the songs when I came on I'll Make a Man Out of You from Mulan. I snickered and clicked play. I didn't know what it was about this song, but I was seriously obsessed with it and it always made me smile. I sang it to myself as I grabbed a water and waited for Miley to come and wish me good luck. I was starting to feel bad for snapping at her. After the song was over her and Liam came over. I smiled and quickly hugged both of them. \"Thanks for coming Liam, and I'm sorry about snapping at you earlier, Miles.\" I told them after we pulled apart. She nodded her acceptance and they both wished me luck before Jake, my manager, pulled me towards the stage again. The beginning notes for my first song came on and I rushed out on stage and sang all the normal songs I did, minus 7 Things since it was about Josh and it always seemed to almost reduce me to tears, but when the crowd started chanting for me to sing it, I couldn't deny them. Though I had to chant to myself through the whole song not to cry. After I sang that, Jake brought me out a stool and my acoustic guitar. He set up a microphone stand and quickly walked off stage. \"Alright, so I've been listening to this song for the last, three days, and can never get it out of my head. So I decided I'd play it for you guys tonight as a treat for always being such a great crowd when I come, and in honor of my last American tour date for this tour.\" I told the crowd, before starting to play. We both lie silently still in the dead of the night Although we both lie close together We feel miles apart inside Was it something I said or something I did? Did my words not come out right? Though I try not to hurt you Yeah I try But I guess that's why they say Every rose has it's thorn Just like every night has it's dawn Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song Every rose has it's thorn Yeah it does I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio Hear the DJ say loves a game Of easy come and easy go But I wonder does he know? Has he ever felt like this? And I know that you'd be here right now If I could let you know somehow Every rose has it's thorn Just like every night has it's dawn Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song Every rose has it's thorn Though it's been a while now I can still feel so much pain Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals But that scar That scar remains Now before this point I had done a fairly good job of keeping the tears at bay, but I couldn't take it anymore. The flood gates opened and the tears started flowing freely. I know I could have saved our love that night If I had known what to say Instead of makin' love We both made our separate ways Now I hear you found somebody new And that I never meant that much to you And to hear that tears me up inside And to see you cuts me like a knife Every rose has it's thorn Just like every night has it's dawn Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song Every rose has it's thorn Yeah When I was finished I thanked everyone for coming and quickly rushed off the stage, running to my dressing room. I knew I had approximately five minutes to compose myself before the V.I.P fans came back to hang out with me for an hour. I heard the door open and looked up to see Miley and Liam walk in. Miley quickly walked over and pulled me into a hug. I cried into her shoulder for a moment before the door opened again. I looked up and was completely surprised to see Harry Styles, aka my best friend, after Miley. I jumped up and rushed into his arms. He ran his hand down my hair soothingly. \"It's gonna be okay, Tare.\" he told me quietly. I shook my head. \"No it's isn't, I miss him so much.\" I sobbed. \"I know. Think about it this way though. After tonight you won't even be in the same country as him for a month, maybe longer if you want, and you can use your time with me and the lads in England to try and get over him.\" Harry comforted. I sniffled and pulled back from Harry's chest. \"Now perk up, love. Your fans are gonna be here soon.\" I smiled and nodded. \"You're right.\" He smirked cheekily. \"Of course I am. I'm Harry Styles. I'm always right.\" He stated. I rolled my eyes and slapped his shoulder. \"Get over yourself, love.\" I told him in a horribly fake British accent. He chuckled and reached his hands up to wipe the smeared make up from under my eyes. \"There all better.\" he said before placing a kiss on my forehead. To anyone who didn't know Harry and I's relationship, which was more like brother and sister than actual friends, would have thought that we had feelings for each other, but this wasn't the case. So when the door opened and the fans were led in, the first thing out of one of the four girls' mouths was, \"OMG! She's dating Harry Styles!\" I sighed and pulled away from Harry. I moved around him to correct her, but the words died in my throat when I realized who was standing there. Not four girls, like I had originally thought, but three girls, one of which who was holding the hand of a very familiar 19 year old actor. Josh Hutcherson; my ex- boyfriend. My eyes widened and I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable he looked, but also how good. I hadn't seen him in about a month, and the only reason I had seen him then was because Miley and I had went to see Liam and he was leaving when we were arriving. His hair looked to be freshly cut, and he was wearing a pair of dark jeans, some Nike's, and a dark blue shirt with the black leather jacket I had gotten him for his birthday over it. As quickly as I could I put an indifferent look on my face and greeted the two girls, who he wasn't holding hands with. I internally started cursing him out. What kind of person comes to their ex- girlfriends concert with his new girlfriend and then comes backstage with V.I.P passes. I stuck my hand out to the first girl who was blonde and blue eyed and wearing a shirt with my face on it. \"Hi!\" I said, probably a little to enthusiastically, but I wanted to show Josh that I was perfectly fine, though thinking about it, he probably saw me run off stage crying. Son. Of. A. Bitch. Anyway, Blondie smiled widely at me and shook my hand. \"Hi! I'm Carly!\" She said super high voice. I had to try really hard not to cringe. I moved to the next girl and shook her hand. \"I'm Jenna!\" she said enthusiastically. I smiled and shook her hand. On to Josh's new girl. I cringed slightly and felt Harry's hand on my arm for support. I looked back to him and sent him a thankful look. I reluctantly held my hand out to shake with her. \"I'm Tori!\" she said with a wide smile. I smiled back even though I wanted to punch her in the face. She was pretty I could give her that. Brown hair, brown eyes, super tan, she looked like she might be Latina. I completely ignored Josh and addressed the three girls. \"So what did you guys think about the concert?\" I asked motioning for them to sit on the couch. Miley and Liam had moved to the love seat. I pulled my make up chair over so Harry could sit down and then I went to grab another one from the other side of the room, but I was pulled to sit down on Harry's lap. I tried to get up but he wrapped an arm around my waist and held me in place. \"Harold Edward Styles, let me up right now!\" I told him. He smirked. \"Nah, I'm perfectly fine to sit like this, love.\" he said. I rolled my eyes and slapped his arm. \"God damn English boys.\" I said under my breath. \"Hey!\" he and Liam both called. I snickered and turned back to the girls. Oh and Josh. \"Anyway, the concert, what'd you think?\" I asked. \"It was amazing! I loved your cover of Every Rose Has It's thorn!\" Jenna said. \"Yeah, it was probably the best one I've ever heard!\" Tori agreed, Carly nodded. I think she was a little star struck by all the people in here. \"Eh, I could've done better.\" Harry said. I turned and glared at him before slapping the back of his head. \"Hey hey hey! Is that anyway to treat the best friend who fly's all the way out here to come retrieve you?\" Harry asked innocently. I just stuck my tongue out at him. \"So you two aren't dating?\" Carly asked. I started laughing, excessively. \"Oh. My. God. That's hilarious! I wouldn't date Harry if he was the last man on earth.\" \"Hey!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm sorry honey, but I'm not sexually attracted to you what so ever. You're like the annoying brother that I can't get rid of.\" I stated. \"That's not what you said last night.\" he retorted with a smirk. \"He's kidding.\" I told the room. \"Yeah, my girls single. Ridin' solo.\" Miley told them casting a glance at Josh who's gaze was locked intently on me. \"Even if I had a thing for Harry, I wouldn't date him. Just got out of a relationship.\" I added as a way of explanation. Josh looked away and I got ready to change the subject, but Harry just had to open his mouth. \"Yeah, he was a total douche bag.\" he stated staring straight at Josh. Josh turned to look at him just as I elbowed Harry in the ribs. \"Harold!\" I hissed. \"Oh I don't know about that. I'm sure Taryn played her part in the break-up.\" Josh threw back. Tori and the other fans looked at him curiously. \"Yeah, maybe I overreacted a little, but I apologized and wanted to fix things, but he wouldn't let me.\" I threw in. \"It probably didn't help that you were running to Styles all the time. He probably thought you were whoring around on him.\" My mouth dropped open before I stood up angrily. \"Fuck you! I wasn't screwing around on you and you know it! That was and still is just your own stupid excuse on why it was right. At least I didn't get a new boyfriend half a month after we broke up! Hell I'm still trying to get over it! Let's not leave out this right now! What kid of person brings his new girlfriend back stage to his exes concert? Oh I know! A fucking prick who never cared about me at all in the three fucking years we were together.\" I yelled. I noticed Harry start to lead the three girls from the room. \"Don't pull that shit with me! I love you and you know it! God your such a self righteous bitch! 'I'm Taryn McCarthy and I can do no wrong! I'm a perfect little princess!' Well I have news for you sweetheart! You are far from fucking perfect!\" He yelled back standing up also. Miley and Liam quickly left the room also. \"I don't think that! And that has nothing to do with any of this! God! I honestly can't believe you! And I honestly think all I was to you was someone you could just go and fuck whenever you wanted! You obviously never cared about me! Did you?\" I yelled as the tears started to pour. \"How can you think that? How can you say that? After everything you really think that I never cared about you? I thought you knew me better than that.\" He yelled. \"Well what the hell else am I supposed to think Josh? Huh? You started dating someone, not even a month after we broke up from a three year relationship!\" \"Yeah, because I was tired of sitting there staring at the phone, not having enough courage to call you and fix things! I didn't want to admit I was wrong. So after two weeks of sitting there and feeling sorry for myself I decided to get a distraction, but it didn't work.\" He said, I didn't notice when he took a few steps closer. \"Well you want to know what I've been doing? I've been waiting two months for that call, and it never came. Instead I have Liam telling me, because he's a good friend, that you have a girlfriend and have had one, and a few days later you show up backstage at my concert with her! So I have nothing else left to believe!\" I said glaring at him. He sighed angrily then kicked out at the table. \"God! You are so fucking stupid!\" He yelled. \"Thanks, that makes me feel so much better about myself. Anything else you wanna do or say to cut me down some more? I mean you've already flaunted your new girlfriend in my face, now I'm fucking stupid. Wanna tell me I look like I've gained weight too?\" I asked sarcastically. He sighed once again, though more in frustration then anger. \"I didn't want to do this. I didn't plan this.\" He said to himself softly. \"So what you were just gonna come to my concert with your girlfriend and then leave?\" I asked sarcastically once again. \"Actually yeah. The only reason I agreed to come tonight was because I wanted to see how you were. I didn't even know she had V.I.P passes until twenty minutes ago.\" he replied. I shook my head and pointed to the door. \"Get out Josh. Just go.\" I said softly. \"Tar-\" I cut him off. \"Go!\" I yelled. He nodded and walked past me towards the door. I heard it open, but he turned back to me. \"No, you know what? I'm going to talk and you're going to listen for once.\" He told me. I tried to tell him to just leave, but he stopped me. \"You have no self confidence what so ever. None. At all. I get it. But you should. You are the smartest, most beautiful girl I know and I don't know how many more times you need to hear it for you to believe it. I've told you everyday for the past three years and you never once believed me. I know you've had a bad past. I was there for a lot of it, but you can't let that hold you back anymore. I've never wanted to hurt you. Ever. It kills me to think about how much it must have hurt you when you found out about Tori, but she never meant anything to me. Not like you did. I'm sorry, that you felt like you never meant anything to me, and in your head it was probably the only logical explanation for why we weren't together... But you have to believe me when I say this sweetheart.\" He walked back to me and held my face in his hands. \"It was never about the sex with you. Yeah it was great, and you are phenomenal in bed- he flashed me a smirk and I giggled through my tears- but I was with you because I love you. I still do. I love the girl who takes my shit, but dishes it right back out. The girl who's family and friends mean more to her than anything, the girl who cracks her knuckles incessantly. The girl who loves music so much that she built herself one of the biggest fan bases out there and is still the same down to earth girl that she has always been. I love you Taryn Isabelle McCarthy and that's never going to change. I'm sorry I didn't turn around right after I left. I'm sorry that I made you think you were nothing and I'm sor-\" I cut him off by placing my lips against his and throwing my arms around his neck to pull him closer. \"I love you, Josh.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own the lyrics in this one shot!

It had been a week since i first arrived in New York and i still didn't have any friends. I moved to New York two weeks ago. It was a huge change from where i used to live: a small town called Winterberry. There i fit in perfectly AND i actually had friends there. Here not so much. Who am i kidding i dont have any friends. At all! I closed my locker and the bell rang. Class was about to start... Ugh maths class how annoying! Even though i said i had no friends i sat with a very nice and pretty girl during class. Her name was Alex. She had shoulder-length chocolate brown hair and light blue eyes. My very short and black hair now looked dull and ugly. I also met Josh. An extremely hot guy that i sort of have a crush on. I mean who wouldn't: he has dreamy brown hair and mezmerising hazel eyes. If i wasn't surrounded by people i probably would have started to drool! I realised i wasn't the only one who had a crush on him. Jessica, a very pretty girl with perfect blonde hair and twinkling blue eyes,she was exactly like a Barbie doll only more snobby and dirty minded. I hear she's known for wat she does on the matress. I shivered, i never knew someone could be so dirty minded! Had a massive crush on him. She kept giving Josh flirty looks and Josh kept giving her one right back. I looked from Jessica to Josh. They're probably together i thought. My chances of him getting mezmerised by my charm, was now really low. I mean i had met plenty of hot boys but none as hot as him. I was determined to make him notice me but i had absolutely no idea how. \"Hey Jenelle!\"Alex said to a girl with silver blonde hair\"Meet Victoria, a friend and newbie here\". Suddenly it felt like the whole world had gone quiet and was waiting for my response. Being a shy girl i had no idea what to say. Josh looked around from me to Alex to everyone else. \"Uh hi Vennesa\" Josh said breaking the silence. \"Its Victoria\" i replied annoyed that he got my name wrong. How am i supposed to get him to like me if he can't even get my name right! ","Summary":" hey this is my second story so plz Review Chapter 1 VICTORIA'S POV I sighed.

I knew I only had seconds more before I ran out of breath. Dark patches appeared across my vision, and I knew my time was running out. I had one last attempt to struggle to the surface, so I forced my arms to pull through the water, forced my legs to kick me as hard as they could up. Or was that down? Everything was so dark. I really needed air, but I couldn't get to the surface. There was nothing I could do. My eyes were about to close completely when I felt something take hold of my backpack, taking some weight off my shoulders. Searching blindly in the water for the source of my rescue, I felt an arm slide around my back, pulling me back to the surface. I wasn't going to make it in time. There wasn't enough oxygen left in my lungs. But then we broke the surface of the water, and I let my lungs fill with beautiful, fresh oxygen. Exhausted, I let Trevor pull me towards the edge of the water, onto dry ground. \"My backpack was too heavy,\" I said by way of explanation, both to myself and to Trevor and Sean. Still short of breath and exhausted, I felt my backpack lifted completely off my shoulders, and I turned, dragging myself higher up the rocky ground, collapsing into a coughing, sodden heap. I felt Trevor to one side of me, and his skin was the warmest thing I had felt in a long time. I automatically moved towards him slightly, hoping that the warmth of his skin could warm mine up – I was beginning to fear I'd gotten hypothermia from the water. After a few moments, I managed to piece together a few words. \"Thank you.\" \"So where's that put us now?\" Trevor asked, panting almost as hard as I was. I laughed at the fact he could still try to be funny at this point in time. \"Back to one.\" We both laughed briefly, and looked up to the ceiling. \"Where are we?\" Sean asked. Staring at the ceiling, I watched as the lights danced around. It was an amazing sight; words simply fail to describe the beauty of the moment. Peering over my shoulder to see Trevor's reaction to the sight, I smiled when I realised that he had saved my life in more ways then one, and I would forever be in his debt. And it didn't even bother me. ","Summary":" My vision began to swim as I realised my chances of getting to the surface decreased.

You're it!\" Katie yelled as we ran around my backyard. Katie's my best friend, and she's been my best friend since we were five years old. We've grown up together and of course, we've had our fair share of fights, but in the end, we always made up. She's been amazing! She's stuck by me and supported me with my acting career, even when I left and forgot about her. But that's all in the past and we're stronger than ever. She sits quietly there Black waterin a jar Says baby why you Trembling like you are \"Oh yeah, well, I'm not gonna be it for long!\" I called out as I chased after her. I chased her around the backyard for about five minutes before finally tackling her to the ground. We rolled around in the grass, laughing our heads off. When we finally stopped rolling, I was on top of her, propping myself up on my elbows. She looked up at me with her beautiful blue eyes, and I reached down to move a strand of her red hair away from them. I need to tell her, before it's too late. So I wait And I try I confess like a child \"Josh, what's wrong?\" she asks me with a concerned look on her face. She knows me so well, and it never ceases to amaze me how easily she reads my face like a book. \"Nothing, I promise. It's just…I need to tell you something, but I'm worried about what will happen after I tell you. I don't wanna ruin anything, ya know?\" It's taking all I have not to vomit on her right now. \"What are you talking about? You know you can tell me anything. What's going on?\" She has the most terrified look on her face at this point, I have to tell her now… I can't go back. Well, here it goes. I roll off of her and sit on the grass as she does the same. \"You see, the thing is, I know what I want to say to you, I just don't know how to say it, so I'm just going to do it in the best way I can, okay?\" She looks utterly confused, but hopefully she'll understand. \"Okay, do whatever you have to do, I just want to know what's going on with you,\" she says with such concern in her eyes.

I mean, we used to be best friends, and don't get me wrong, we still are... just not to the same degree. I guess things kinda got messed up when we started dating. Again, don't get me wrong, we were a great couple! We just got into too many stupid fights I guess. I want him back though... Don't walk away like you always do, this time. Baby you're the only thing that's been on my mind. He's like the only thing I can think of, and he's always on my mind, I mean, can you blame me! He's Josh Hutcherson for crying out loud! Yes, you heard me right, I dated Josh Hutcherson, and yes, he is my best friend. I just wish he felt the same way I do! But, he doesn't, I think he's about to ask this other girl out, her name is Brianne. I'm Ashley, but my friends call me Ley (pronounced like Lee). I'm 16 years old and I have blonde hair... Josh always loved my hair. Ever since you left, I've been a mess (You won't answer your phone) I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone, But I gotta let you know... I'm gonna invite him over tonight. I need to tell him how I feel. I mean, I value our friendship, and I know it didn't work before, but now we're older, and we've been friends much longer, so we know each other even better this time. I'm not sure how he feels about it, but I intend to find out. I wanna get back to the old days, When the phone would ring, And I knew it was you. I wanna talk back, and get yelled at, Fight for nothing, like we used to. Oh kiss me, like you mean it, Like you miss me, cause I know that you do. I wanna get back, get back, with you. *Ding Dong* I got up from my place on the couch and answered the door. There he was, standing on my front porch with a goofy grin on his face, and my favorite movie, The Benchwarmers. \"Hey Ley,\" Josh said as he pulled me into a hug. \"Hey Josh,\" I replied as i took in the scent of his cologne. He always smelled so good! \"So, you ready for some super funny comedy?\" he asked as he made his way to my DVD player. \"Of course! David Spade is like my fave!\" I replied as I plopped myself back down on my couch. There was something in his eyes when he looked at me. I knew his was worried about me ever since the break up, but he never said anything. Don't look at me that way, I see it in your eyes. Don't worry about me, I've been fine. I'm not gonna lie, I've been a mess, Since you left. And every time I see you, It gets more and more intense. It was about halfway through the movie, and I could tell Josh knew something was up. I'd been unusually quiet, and that just wasn't like me. I was so nervous about talking to him! I kept my distance the best I could, and tried to focus on the movie. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Josh had received a text. \"Who you talking to?\" I asked, hoping it wasn't who I thought it was. \"Brianne. She wants to hang out tonight,\" he replied, not looking at me once. My heart sank into my stomach, I had totally blown it, and now, he was going to ditch me for Brianne. \"Oh... um, I'm gonna go get something to drink,\" I mumbled as I walked as quickly as I could to my kitchen. I wanna get back, to the old days, When the phone would ring, and I knew it was you. I wanna talk back, and get yelled at, Fight for nothing, like we used to. Oh kiss me, like you mean it, Like you miss me, Cause I know that you do. I wanna get back, get back, with you. \"Ashley,\" Josh called as he followed me into my kitchen, \"Are you okay? What's wrong? You haven't been yourself all night.\" \"I'm fine, really, don't worry about me. Have fun at Brianne's,\" I said. I was facing my sink, refusing to look at him. \"Ley, tell me what's wrong, please?\" he asked while walking over to me, and gently grabbing my arm, turning me towards him in the process. You were the only one I wanted, And you were the first one I fell for. You're the one that I'm in need of, And I don't wanna be lonely anymore. \"I... God! Why do you have to know me so well?\" I cried, while ripping away from his grip. He of course, followed me, and again, grabbed my wrist and spun me around to face him. \"Will you just talk to me!\" he begged, worry very visible in his eyes. \"I miss you Josh! I miss you so much!\" I finally caved, this was it, I had to tell him. \"What are you talking about, I'm right here!\" he said, totally oblivious to what I really meant, as he pulled me into a hug. \"No, I mean, I wanna get back together with you. I miss being a couple, I miss being able to call you my boyfriend. But I can't do that anymore because you've got Brianne! And I know you don't feel the same way, but I just can't help how I feel!\" I cried, literally this time. I hated crying, but I honestly couldn't help it. I pulled away from him and went out onto my front porch. I needed some air, I needed to clear my head. I heard the door open and close and then I felt two arms make their way around my waist. \"There is nothing going on between me and Brianne,\" he whispered into my ear. I spun around, shocked, and just looked at him. He grinned at me, and I felt myself smile. \"Really? But I thought-\" he silenced me by placing the most amazing kiss on my lips. I kissed back almost instantly. When we pulled away from each other, he looked directly into my eyes for the longest time, and then, he told me something that I will never forget. \"I love you Ashley.\" \"I love you too Josh.\" I wanna get back, get back, get back!

And a lot of other stuff. But not this. If I did own this, then I would be out spending my money at Aeropostale. ;) Unfortunately, again, I do not own it. Don't sue me. This is my first ever fanfiction: please do not murder me. Thanks! Awkward It was cold, so cold. It pierced Sean's skin, giving him goosebumps and making him want to curl up in some hidden corner and fall asleep. He sat on the edge of the make-shift raft, splinters crawling into his legs. Sean coughed, rubbed his hands together, and looked across the murky waters. \"Trevor?\" he asked, \"do you think we're going to make it?\" His uncle, Trevor, glanced back at him momentarily. He exchanged a look with Hannah, their mountain guide. \"Depends,\" he said softly with a grave expression on his face. After that, there was a painfully awkward silence. Sean didn't like that answer. Chills raced up and down his spine. He shivered, pulled his knees to his chest, and rested his cheek on them. Why am I so cold? It's like, a hundred degrees in here. The obvious reply would be that he was getting some sort of disease, but he decided not to think so. Hannah and Trevor were presently trying to hold the raft together, pulling on the rough ropes that were attached to their faux sail. Sean wrinkled his nose, staring past his flirting uncle and beginning to day-dream of better places. That was when Hannah let out a sudden cry. \"I thought we were past the fish!\" exclaimed Sean, thinking she had witnessed a scaly tail pass them. She fell back, staring at her bloody hands. Sean rolled his eyes, but then realized the danger of the situation as Trevor, too, let go of the sail. Sean jumped to his aching feet and ran over to Hannah's rope, grabbing a tight hold of it. \"Trevor!\" he bellowed, reaching for the other rope. \"No!\" yelled Trevor, leaving Hannah for his nephew. \"Don't do that, Sean!\" Sean had taken hold of both ropes; he recognized his mistake. He tried to wrap the rope around the nearest wooden pole, but the pole broke with the strength of the wind. He felt a sudden surge of fear rise within him, threatening to overwhelm him. That was before Trevor started for the other rope. The wind became abruptly stronger. Sean felt a strange tugging sensation: then, he flew forward, off the raft, his feet dangling. Having always been afraid of heights, Sean let out a terrified shout. Looking back, it was far too late. His uncle was near to hysteria, calling for Sean, and Hannah was attempting to comfort Trevor to no avail. Sean looked ahead. He was floating onward, whether he liked it or not. He looked down, and saw how far above the rippling waters he was. His vision quivered for a moment, his brain feeling dizzier by the second. In search of anything familiar, he peered back toward the raft. Only to find that it was gone. That was when Sean looked down again. Oddly enough, the water seemed…closer. Huh? I thought I was higher up than this… Sean thought, confused. Then, he started to plummet toward the water. Struggling to free his hands from the ropes, Sean felt himself enveloped by liquid faster than he had expected. He kicked at his hands in the hopes that somehow, he could free himself: but as he pulled his hands out and fought to the surface and took a deep breath of sweet, sweet air, his right leg became entangled. He began to sink down as the sail did. Sean blacked out purely from fear (although exhaustion was setting in also). Sand filled his vision. Sand was his vision. Sean rubbed his eyes, sitting up. He expected to receive a mouthful of water, but instead he got oxygen. \"Yes!\" Sean muttered, ignoring a slight pain in his lung cavity. He went to stand, after his eyes adjusted to the light, but his right leg was hurting. It felt as though it was ensnared by something. Sean looked down. It was, most painfully, ensnared by something: the rope was still wrapped ever so tightly about it. Sean cursed under his breath, sat back down, and tugged on the rope. He grunted, face scrunching up. Well that sucked, Sean thought, pulling harder. Stinging, aching feelings lanced through his body, gathered at his right calf. He pulled harder, wishing to be free: and then, he was. \"My god,\" he muttered, looking at his leg. It was scathed greatly, with blood seeping down the sides; there were rope burns collected from where the rope had been. Sean wondered how long the rope had been there. Well, he thought, standing on one foot and hopping forward, I've got to go somewhere. Sean was starting to be scared again. He was all alone in an unknown place. Then he heard the semi-familiar chirping. \"Hey, little guy,\" he said, unable to resist the temptation to smile. He looked up at the luminescent wings of the tiny bird, which cocked its head and chirped at him in an almost concerned way. \"Don't worry,\" said Sean, waving his hand in the air, \"I'll be fine. Hey…do you happen to know where any water is? I wouldn't feel like drinking salt water anyway, but after seeing those weird creatures…\" The bird seemed to understand. He flitted toward a small crevice Sean hadn't bothered to notice before. \"Cool,\" said Sean aloud. He followed the bird down a couple of tunnels, hearing an ever-growing-in-loudness sound of dripping. Sean swallowed as he heard the sound louder, and louder: finally, he reached the fresh water. \"Thanks, little guy,\" said Sean conversationally. He looked around. \"Where'd you get off to?\" The fluttering of little wings reached his ears. He turned to the left and saw the bird. \"Oh, hi again,\" Sean said, blushing from his stupidity. The bird had been floating beside his head the whole time. \"Do we really have to go this way?\" Sean asked, limping forward. He tripped into a huge cavern, and his pocketknife floated out from his pocket. \"Oh my god,\" Sean said, standing up. \"Magnetic field, right, little guy?\" The bird chirped, flying toward the center, then flying back. \"Coming, coming,\" Sean murmured, stepping toward the center of the room. He saw big chunks of rock, all floating about each other. Before he even had time to think, his brain had figured it out. If he was to continue onward, he'd have to leap from rock to rock. That is, without falling about, oh, three miles or so. Sean moaned, and jumped for the first rock. \"Last one,\" whispered Sean, \"last one.\" He was sweating again, more likely from the anxiety rather than the body heat. Sean thought, I can make this. I can so totally make this. I will jump, I will land, I will sit there, and I will jump again, and I will be on solid ground. Sean stood on both his legs, trying to staunch the pain flowing from his right leg. He got into a runner's starting position, and leaped, adrenaline flowing through his veins. He landed safely; he thought all was well until he began to teeter on the edge. He grabbed hold of the huge hunk of rock, and it began to move downward. Feeling nothing but pity for himself, Sean held on as the rock spun. It spun again, then again, then again. Sean whimpered, wishing, if nothing else, for it to end. Then, it did. Am I dead? Sean asked himself. He opened his eyes, and saw that the rock had spun so many times that it had landed atop the ground Sean had been trying to reach. \"Thanks, God,\" Sean said, crawling forward and collapsing onto the rocky earth. The chirping restarted. \"I'm coming,\" Sean said, standing up and brushing himself off. \"relax.\" He limped after the bird, at least knowing that if the next trouble had anything to do with spinning, he'd make it halfway. It was a desolate wasteland, with the exception of a few humongous bones sticking out of the dry ground. Sean cautiously walked forward, thinking of the movie Dinosaur and also Jurassic Park . \"There will not be dinosaurs,\" Sean said just to calm himself. \"There will not be dinosaurs.\" That was when the earth below his feet (or rather, foot) began to rattle. \"Shit!\" Sean yelled, running onward. The bird was ahead of him by several feet, and whatever it was that was behind him was behind by several meters. Sean hurried faster, and faster, racing around tall rocks and avoiding bones that lay around. Looking for the nearest possible escape route, Sean saw two cracks, deep in the reddish rock before him. He had crossed the cavern, but which road should he take? The teenager picked up and rock, and backed into the left tunnel. He saw the looming face of a Tyrannosaurus Rex ahead of him. He swallowed, and making hardly any sound at all, tossed the rock into the other tunnel. Roaring wildly, the T. Rex hurried into the other tunnel, crashing it open. Sean ran out of his own tunnel, running around the edge and hiding behind an overlarge bone. The T. Rex suddenly bashed out of the tunnels and sniffed the air. It turned its big head toward Sean's scent and growled. Sean backed into the wall, finding himself sliding into yet another tunnel. He back-pedaled with his feet, pushing himself up against the only wall he could find. The dinosaur stuck his head in and roared. Sean pressed his whole body against the wall, taking ragged breaths. His hands searched for any sort of weapon. He found a sharp, pointed, large rock; when the T. Rex leaned in close, its mouth open for sniffing-the-air purposes, Sean shoved the rock deep into the throat of the monster. It did nothing. The T. Rex took in deep breaths of Sean's scent, as if testing its next meal before eating it. Then, it leaned forward, jaws wide open. Sean started to scream. Trevor's conscience had been bothering him ever since he'd seen Sean float away on the strings of a ripping sail. Hannah had told him, time and time again, that 'Sean was a smart boy' and that 'He'll be able to find his way to the river anyway.' Still, Trevor was a worried uncle. He had said to Hannah several moments ago, \"I'm sorry, but I've got to find Sean. If I get out and he doesn't…not only will my sister-in-law never forgive me, I'll never forgive myself either.\" She had said that she understood, and that he should go back. She had also said she'd wait at the river. Presently Trevor was striding through a pretty big cavern. There was nothing of any importance lingering, merely a couple rocks here and there. He reached the wall opposite him in a matter of seconds. He sat down on a rock, anger filling him: then, he heard an oddly familiar voice. Trevor thought, No, it's not Sean, it's somebody else. Hannah? No, she's back there, and plus, her voice isn't that deep. Trevor kicked a rock and leaned back against the wall. He was startled by the abrupt sound of screams. \"Sean!?\" he hollered at the wall, backing up. Sean himself was still breathing in air from within the dinosaur's mouth. He was shouting, yelling, screaming himself hoarse as he searched the ground for another rock: he found another, which was bigger than the last. With his loudest scream of terror, he thrust the rock completely down the T. Rex's throat. This time, the rock went the correct way and into the dinosaur's airway. Sean stopped screaming, breathing hard. The T. Rex looked as though it would collapse any moment, but still, it turned its monumental head toward Sean and bellowed. The teenager, of pure fright, screamed once more, then fainted. Trevor threw rock after rock at the wall, hearing only a faint roaring and then Sean's screams. He was frightened, not for himself, but for his nephew. \"Sean!\" yelled Trevor, kicking the wall. He even threw a couple of punches its way, but it wasn't until he body-slammed it that it fell through. His nephew fell into his arms. Sean was completely unconscious. Trevor put him down and looked into the newly-made cave. A dead Tyrannosaurus Rex was lying on the floor. \"Sean?\" asked Trevor, giving him the once-over. Sean didn't seem to have too many injuries, but his right leg appeared positively awful, with two or three gashes cress-crossing it. Trevor was about to begin to carry Sean back the way he'd come, but just then, Sean blinked open his eyes with a groan. \"That's the second time…\" he mumbled. Then he actually sat up and looked around. His uncle was standing in front of him, looking bewildered, relieved, and at the same time, stressed. Sean hugged Trevor in a brotherly fashion, backing away in a couple of seconds. Trevor gestured to the dinosaur, and asked weakly, \"You…?\" The teenager nodded. \"Yeah, I threw a rock into its mouth. It got lodged in its air passage.\" Trevor and Sean began to walk (or in Sean's case, limp) farther away from the ruins of the dinosaur. They discussed the possible ways to find Hannah, what had happened to both of them, whether or not Hannah had kept the raft that they were still in need of, and then, there was a silence. It wasn't awkward at all. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I own nothing but the clothes on my back. And a lot of other stuff. But not this.

Thought it was kind of sad that Max wrote a letter to Sean but not to Trevor. Thought I'd fix that. For any readers who haven't seen the movie, here's your basic needed background: Max and Trevor are brothers, and Max is Sean's father. Max and Trevor worked together as scientists, but Max disappeared in 1997 after going to Iceland to check one of his volcanic sensors. Long story short, Max found his way to the center of the Earth, and then realized he was stranded there and the temperature was quickly rising. Max died. To put it bluntly. Anyways, the movie is about Trevor and Sean following in Max's footsteps and ending up in the center of the Earth ten years later, where the temperature is once again rising. They find Max (don't really want to think about what this entails) and also his diary, in which he wrote a letter to Sean. And I think he should've written to Trevor, too, so there. Now he did. August 14, 1997 Trevor, First off, I want to thank you. Without your help, I never would have been able to find this wonderful, amazing place. When I entered the center of the Earth six weeks ago, I was so shocked that the only thing running through my mind was \"I wish Trevor were here to see this. And to carry this awfully heavy backpack.\" In all seriousness, though, I was thinking of you. I passed by some dandelions, you see. Maybe you don't remember, but when we were little we used to blow the little silvery seeds off those things like there was no tomorrow. Mom would yell at us for spreading weeds all over her garden, but we didn't mind. In fact, you always complained that the dandelions weren't big enough and that we ran out of them too quickly. Well, little brother, these would've been big enough for you. I swear, there were so many of those seeds that the heads of the dandelions were at least three times the size of mine! I blew a few for you. Maybe someday you'll get the chance, too. I know that I never told you I was a Vernian, and I'm sorry about that, but I just didn't know how to tell you that I was secretly trying to find a way into the center of the earth without sounding crazy. I didn't want to lose your respect, Trevor. That's always meant everything to me. Hey, it turns out that I was right, though, doesn't it? How's that for scientific discovery? Man, when I saw those sensor readings and took off for Iceland, I was ready to call in every scientific journal and every news crew in existence. But now it looks like you're going to have to do it for me. I've been down here for six weeks, Trevor, and it's been getting hotter the whole time. It was almost cold at first. Now it's dangerously hot. I'm not going to make it out of here alive. I know that, and I accept that. My biggest regrets are that I didn't get another chance to tell my wife how much I love her, that I'm not going to see my son grow up, and that I'll never get the chance to share this with you. With all the work you put into this, this is as much your discovery as mine. Will you do me a favor? Teach Sean to play baseball. Take him out to the batting cage sometimes. It's going to be hard on him, growing up without a father, but at least I know he'll have the best uncle in the world. Today's his birthday, you know. Trevor, if you ever find this, know that you're the best brother I could ask for. Thank you for that. Share this place with the world, all right? It's got the most beautiful scenery in existence, and I've seen enough of the world to know what I'm talking about. Just make sure you don't come down here when the temperature's rising high enough to boil you alive. Farewell and love, Max A/N: Reviews are appreciated, even if you happened to read this without watching the movie and have absolutely no idea what you just read.

Except, of course, for the animal noises in the background. The stars had come out a long time ago, and I watched them. I watched as they rolled over the sky and took shape. I watched them tell the stories of the past. I loved how one thing could make you feel like you were part of something big. Like you had a meaning in this world. I was up on the roof, lying down, because I had managed—again—to fall and hit my head on the way up. I was getting used to it, but every now and again I would fall and get a bloody nose, or hit my head and see stars, not like the ones I saw tonight though. Today was Friday, finally the weekend. I had stopped by Lily's, but Kelly told me she was in the shower. That statement made certain images of Lily wash through my mind, at a moment that would have best for them not to. I barely managed an okay before I took off to the roof in embarrassment. I could feel my face redden when I had walked past my dad, hoping he wouldn't notice. I must have been up on the roof for an hour when I heard clanging, meaning someone was trying to get up to the roof through my bedroom. I figured it was my dad. He always comes up here to check I hadn't fallen off the side. So I didn't pay attention, until I saw a flash of blonde hair. I snapped my head to the side to see who it was, and to my surprise… Lily climbed through the window. \"Hey,\" she said smiling. She had a flashlight in hand, and she wore a tight tank top with knee length shorts. Thank god. \"Hey,\" I said, noticing her wet hair and fresh scent. She crawled over and snuggled up next to me. She reached over and pulled her hair away from me and put it on her left shoulder. She let her head fall in the crook of my neck. \"So what're you up to?\" she asked lightly. She scooted closer when a gust of wind blew past her. I pulled myself together enough to wrap my hands around her, trying to keep her warm. \"I don't know, I came up here to think.\" I told her. She turned and looked at me, I almost got lost in those beautiful eyes. \"About what?\" She asked, a smile playing at her lips. \"I… Well, um… you.\" I stuttered. I felt the blush come up on my face again, and I felt my heart beating so hard it might burst out of my chest. \"Well, Dyl, I've been thinking about you too.\" She whispered, as if someone might hear her, \"And you know what I've decided?\" She asked. There it goes again. My hearts beating so fast it hurts. \"What?\" I choked out. \"I love the way you dress.\" She whispered. I laughed. I laughed really hard, and then she joined in. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was a start. \"You want to know what I was thinking?\" I asked her. 20 seconds. Here we go. \"What?\" She asked. It had been three months now. I've been her boyfriend for two months now. It was time I showed her how I felt. 15 seconds left. \"Remember when… I told you I loved you?\" I asked, she nodded, \"Well, now I can't live without you. And—\" I stopped and looked in her eyes. I was leaning up over her and she was silently waiting for me to finish, lying on the roof beneath me. I couldn't find the words, so I leaned down. My heart was pounding so hard, I'd be surprised if she didn't hear it. I stopped inches away from her mouth, wanting so bad to taste her. I waited, wanting permission. She leaned up and pressed her lips against mine. I shifted a little, so my weight wouldn't press down on top of her. She eagerly pushed up into the kiss. I had 5 seconds left of bravery. I poked at her lips with my tongue, begging for entrance. She quickly agreed and opened her mouth. I slid my tongue in and explored her mouth. She tasted wonderful. She was so delicate and lovely and ultimately mine. I ran my tongue down the side of hers and she sighed. She moaned into the kiss when I shifted again. I really didn't want to, but I had to pull away. I needed air. I needed to calm myself, before she saw my growing issue. Lily just did that to me. \"Dyl?\" She whispered when I turned from her. \"Yeah?\" I grunted. \"Did I do it wrong?\" She asked, tearfully. I turned abruptly, issue or not, \"Of course not, Lily! Why would you think that? That was… that was… amazing.\" \"Oh…\" She noticed the slight tenting, but thankfully readjusted her eyes to my face, so I wasn't too embarrassed. \"You're amazing Lily. And I love you for it. I love all of you.\" I said, \"Especially that kiss.\" I added. \"Dyl?\" She asked again, eyes focused on my face. \"Yeah?\" \"I'm cold. Could we go in?\" I noticed again, the wet hair and tank top. The water trails running down her chest and into… Oh, god stop. \"Yeah, we can go in. Sorry.\" I said. She crawled in front of me and through the window and I followed. She laid down on my bed before I even got out of the window pane. \"Come here,\" She called quietly. I obeyed. I followed her as she scooted over on the bed and let me in. She let her hands run down my chest. She was trying to kill me. She knew what she was doing to me, \"Lily.\" I choked out as she let her hand slip under my shirt and push it up a little. \"Lily, wait.\" I said reaching for her hand. \"Yes Dylan?\" She asked, an innocent smile played at her lips. \"I… Are you sure?\" I asked. It was only a month ago we'd had the talk. Whether she thought she was ready for any big steps. \"I'm not ready for… that. Yet.\" She told me, \"But I know you've been waiting patiently… and I want to show you… I want to show you how much I love you.\" She finished. She started running her hands down my sides again. Cliff hanger! Mwaha! 5 reviews and I'll post another chapter. ~Mandi[Chapter 2] \"Lily… are you sure? It's… only been three months,\" I gasped as she kissed my neck. This was so not like her. \"Are you saying you don't want it?\" She asked looking me straight in the eyes. It was hard enough to resist for now, but if I looked into those beautiful eyes… I might just submit to everything this woman wanted. I couldn't do that. It'd be like taking advantage of her. I grabbed her hands that were itching down my torso, and held them to my chest, \"Lily… you have no idea how much I want you,\" I said, kissing her deeply to prove my point, \"But… I feel like I'm taking advantage of you. I want to do this—whatever this is—on a special night, ya know? I've never met anyone like you, and I want us to last.\" \"I said I wasn't ready for that… yet.\" She repeated. \"I know, so maybe some rules?\" I asked, she flashed me a brilliant smile. I took that as a good idea. \"Well… no removing of clothes. For the time being, of course.\" I blushed, and could feel the crimson rising in my cheeks, \"Hands can run underneath, but not completely off.\" \"Okay… that's reasonable. I just have one request…\" She said, and then stopped. \"What?\" I asked, she laughed and looked away. \"Never mind. I want to see if you can figure it out.\" She said giving me a peck on the cheek. I rolled us over so I was on top. She giggles beneath me, and color rose in her cheeks. I knew this wouldn't go too far tonight, but I also knew she was teetering on the edge of being ready for something more. I leaned down and kissed her, it was sweet, just on the lips. After a few minutes, I opened my mouth and let my tongue swipe at her lower lip. She quickly obliged and opened up her mouth for me. I pushed my tongue into her mouth, and Lily engaged in a quick fight for dominance, which I won. I guess living out here on her own really made her competitive for attention. I guess she was a bit mad over losing, because she lifted her hips off the bed and rubbed herself against my erection. A groan escaped my lips, as she pulled away. \"That wasn't fair.\" I whispered in a low, husky voice. \"Neither was pulling rank over me.\" She said smirking. \"I won that fight fair and square,\" I told her and let my hands rest on her hips. She squirmed a little when I pushed her hips down into the mattress, and practically growled, \"I'm testing boundaries. Don't tempt me.\" \"Wouldn't dream of it.\" she smirked. I continued to kiss her, trying to calm myself throughout the session. It was nearly impossible with all the little moans that kept escaping her lips. It led me to think of what other noises I could extract from that pretty, little mouth. I began to get painfully hard. \"A bit excited are we?\" She smirked again. I growled. She chuckled. Footsteps began pounding up the stairs, and we both jumped out of our skin. We rolled off the bed and made a break for the window. I helped Lily out, and pulled myself out the window before my dad's voice came into the bedroom. \"It's time to eat you two. Enough with that roof business. She's probably freezing.\" She called into the room. I waited a few seconds and called back, \"Are Kelly and Lily staying for dinner?\" \"Yeah, so get a move on. Kelly's waiting.\" He said as he shut the door. Lily giggled. \"That was close.\" She smiled real wide. \"I know,\" I said giving her a hug. \"You know…\" she started, snuggling closer to my chest, \"I am really cold.\" We both laughed and I wrapped my arms around her. She pushed my through the window and she followed soon after. I decided to fix the bed sheets before we made our way down. No need for any groundings. I smiled as we walked down the stairs and reached out. Her hair was no longer wet.[Chapter 3] Hey guys! This is your author… Don't kill me THIS IS NOT AN UPDATE I'm just letting you know that the next chapter is coming! I have all my AP exams to study for, but I'm almost ready to post. I'd like to thank you for all the reviews(: You've certainly overwhelmed me by how much you all liked this story. I'll have to write quicker, no? Well, Happy Easter everyone. Maybe I'll post it tonight. That could be your Easter present from me. You never know. It could happen. All my love, Amanda 3[Chapter 4] My dad is a very predictable man, and so are his dinners. I could tell by just walking down the steps with Lily that it was going to be Spaghetti again. He has a very well thought out plan in his head that makes it seem like you're eating different things every time you come, but it's just a ruse. It's all basically the same. So we were eating Spaghetti again. \"Hey Lil,\" I said pulling her back a bit, \"Do I look like I've been kissing you?\" \"You look like you've been enjoying yourself.\" She answered. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" I asked, folding my arms. \"It means, you look nothing like the Dylan I first knew. The Dylan who drew decapitated monsters in a journal. You look happy.\" I was a bit shocked by that answer, to be frank. \"So is that a no?\" I said raising an eyebrow. \"That is a most definite no. You'll be fine.\" She told me grabbing my hand and pulling me down the hallway into the dining room slash kitchen thing we had. \"Hey Dyl can you grab the cheese?\" My dad asked looking up a bit. I could tell he was a bit stressed over the Zoo. Yeah, it opened and a ton of people come and go, but it's still stressful. \"Uh yeah,\" I said walking over to the fridge, and grabbing the green container. Lily took a seat next to Kelly and across from me. \"So you look a bit flushed,\" Kelly commented when I sat down. I cough really loud. \"Uh, what? Why would you- I mean I,\" I stuttered, \"Um, it's really cold out tonight.\" \"Ah. That's all?\" She smirked. She looked just like Lily when she did it. Again, for the third time that night, I could feel the blush creeping on my cheeks. \"He hit his head on the way down. I guess he was a bit embarrassed he fell in front of me. I told him it was all right.\" Lily said dishing herself some noodles. \"You hit your head again? I told you if you weren't careful—\" \"It's my fault really. I started down too quickly and knocked him down.\" She said. She was a graceful liar. I had learned that over the past few months. \"Yeah, Ben. Don't jump to conclusions.\" Kelly chimed in, her mouth full of bread. \"Today I was outside and I saw three frogs.\" Rosie said twirling her spaghetti around a plate. \"Do you think we could catch some frogs and have a frog exhibit?\" \"Sweetheart, those frogs you see are wild frogs. They wouldn't do good in captivity.\" Kelly told her. \"But all the animals in the zoo are wild. That's what daddy told me.\" She said pouting a bit. \"No, daddy meant they're exotic, but every large animal we have were bred in captivity. We're all they've ever known.\" \"We should still have frogs.\" She said getting over her point real fast. \"What did you do today Dylan?\" Kelly asked. \"Well, I tried to work on homework a bit. You know, for that art class I'm taking? I couldn't do it though. I couldn't find any inspiration to draw. And then of course, there was the English homework. I swear that old bat's got it out for me.\" I started ranting about school. Since it started this past month, I've been working part time at the zoo, but mostly staying in to try and complete all my work. I guess slacking off wasn't the best idea in the world at this point. \"Oh, well. You'll find your will to draw soon enough. You've still got the weekend.\" She said. Lilly shot me a look from across the table. She had long past finished eating, and she had her feet resting on mine. I knew what she wanted, but I knew there was no way I'd be able to get out of kitchen duty. I mouthed 'I can't' and she shrugged. Everyone was done, and began putting their dishes in the sink for me to wash. When Kelly announced she was going home with Lily, lily grabbed a few left over dishes and walked into the kitchen side. She dropped a cup, and we both bent down to get it. \"Thanks for tonight.\" She said, pecking me on the lips. It was so quick I had to rethink if it actually happened. She got up and put the dishes in the sink. Authors note— Hey I know I'm sorry I didn't update.

I Think I Love You Chapter One: Happy Birthday Dylan! **********Third Person********** Dylan Mee woke up very early on the day of his 17th birthday, seeing the bright sunshine outside his window. His soft dark hair was messy from all the tossing and turning he'd done the previous night, and his eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep. He heard noises coming from downstairs, so he stood up and pulled on a fresh green t-shirt and some faded jeans. Rubbing his eyes, he headed down the stairs to see his 10-year-old little sister, Rosie, helping their father with breakfast. She looked up at him from where she was stirring what looked like pancake batter and smiled at him brightly. \"Good morning, Dylan!\" She cried, running toward him and throwing her small arms around his neck. \"Happy birthday!\" \"Good morning to you too, Rosie,\" Dylan set his little sister down and ruffled her hair. \"Whatcha making for breakfast?\" \"Pancakes!\" That was the only thing Rosie knew how to make, so it was a good thing Dylan liked pancakes. And Rosie's pancakes were delicious. \"Hey, Dyl, Lilly came by a while ago. Said she wanted you to meet her in the barn after breakfast,\" Benjamin Mee, Dylan and Rosie's father, told him over the morning paper. Dylan nodded and grabbed a glass from the cupboard and the milk from the fridge. He quickly inhaled the pancakes that were set in front of him, chugged his milk, and headed toward the door. He only paused to pull on his black Converse sneakers and grey sweatshirt. He ran out the door quickly and sprinted to the barn to meet his best friend of three years, Lilly. He entered the barn to see her curled up on a pile of hay, sketching quietly in a notebook. Knowing she didn't like to be interrupted while she was drawing, Dylan sat down carefully beside Lilly and waited for her to notice him. She looked up from her drawing and smiled brightly at him. \"Happy birthday Dylan! Did you sleep well?\" \"Yeah, I did, thanks Lilly. What are you drawing?\" Dylan asked as he wrapped one arm around her shoulder. He felt something like an electric current go up his arm when he touched her. That's weird, he thought, but he shrugged it off as nothing. Lilly blushed. \"It's nothing…\" She pushed his arm off and stood up. \"Let's go for a walk. We can go hang out at the Jaguar for a while. I have a present for you.\" \"Ok. Let me text my dad so he knows where I'm going,\" Dylan replied, pulling his cell phone out of his pocket and typing a short message to his dad. When he finished, Lilly was waiting outside for him. \"Let's go. I want to talk to you, and there are too many prying eyes around here.\" Lilly grabbed his arm, and he felt another shock go through him. Lilly must have felt it too, because she quickly dropped Dylan's arm and began walking. They walked in silence for a while, each absorbed in their own thoughts. It wasn't uncomfortable though. The two knew each other well enough that talking usually wasn't necessary. When they entered the Jaguar café, which was closed for the day, they headed upstairs to Lilly's room. Dylan took his usual seat on the chair at the desk, while Lilly sat on the bed. **********Lilly's POV********** As long as I've known Dylan, things had never been awkward between us. We hit it off right from the start. Today, however, felt different. I had a clenching, nervous feeling in my stomach, which had never happened before, not around Dylan. I didn't understand what was different between us. Maybe it's because you like him, as more than a friend. As soon as the thought came, I banished it. I couldn't like Dylan, could I? \"Um… Lilly? Are you ok?\" Dylan asked me. \"You're spacing out.\" Act cool, act cool! I put my signature grin on my face and turned to face my best friend. \"I'm fine. Just thinking about stuff.\" \"Oh. Wanna talk about it?\" He asked me, his brown eyes concerned. He stood up and moved toward the bed. I took a moment to study him. Over the years, he had slowly grown taller than me. His dark hair hung in his brown eyes, and I found that extremely attractive. I had never noticed how good looking Dylan was. \"Lilly, you're doing it again.\" Dylan waved his hand in front of my face. Again, I just smiled at him. He gave me a small smile back and sat down beside me. \"Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me today,\" I mumbled, my cheeks flushing. Dylan noticed, and began chuckling. \"Lilly, your face is red,\" he commented dryly. I smacked his arm. \"I know! Geez!\" I was laughing at this point too, and we just sat laughing like idiots for a while. Finally, we both calmed down enough to resume a normal conversation. \"So, you wanted to talk to me?\" Dylan asked me, gazing into my eyes. I found my attention drawn to his lips, which looked totally kissable at the moment. Whoa! What are you thinking Lilly? You can't kiss your best friend! Are you crazy!? And just like that I was snapped out of my trance. \"Yeah, but it's not important. We can talk later. Can't we just act like goofballs for a little while?\" I replied. I'd missed this. I hadn't really had much time with Dylan lately. We were both busy with work. Dylan grinned. \"So what do you wanna do? We can go back to the barn and swing on our rope, if you want.\" I laughed. \"We haven't done that in years! It's probably rotted by now!\" At that, he just shrugged. \"I can replace it. I'm not some little kid who has to run to his dad for help any more.\" \"I know. Can you believe you're 17 already? Where did the time go?\" I giggled. Dyl really was grown up. We both were. It seemed like yesterday when I first met him when he was 14 and I was 13. We were both so different then. Funny how fast things changed. Dylan just laughed and pulled at my hand. \"Come on, let's go!\" And before I could say anything else, he had pulled me from my bed, out of my room, and into the rain. I could tell that it had just started raining though, because it was sunny when we got here. We ran to the barn quickly, not wanting to get wet, and when we got inside, we stopped to catch our breath. Once we could breathe again, Dyl set to work on fixing our rope swing while I watched him contently. I pulled my sketchbook from the small bag I had strung over my shoulder, and began sketching him. His eyes, his hair, his lips… There I went again. Thinking about his lips. What was wrong with me? I shook my head to clear it, and began my drawing again. **********Dylan's POV********** I worked quickly on the rope swing that my dad had put up for me and Rosie a few years ago, replacing it with stronger rope. As I worked, I found my mind wandering to Lilly. She had been acting rather strange. She looks really pretty today though… Wait, what? Since when do I think like that about my best friend? It was true though. She had pulled her hair up into a messy ponytail for the day, and wore no makeup. She was absolutely beautiful. I had to shake my head. Where were these thoughts coming from? Oh, well. I just shook my head and continued my work. **********Third Person********** Dylan and Lilly spent the rest of the day just hanging out in the barn, and at about 7 they went back to Dylan's house for cake and presents. When they arrived, Benjamin Mee, Dylan's dad brought out a simple cake iced with plain white. Written on the top, in dark blue letters, were the words, \"Happy 17th Birthday Dylan.\" Rosie carefully lit the candles with her father's help, and set the cake in front of Dylan. Everyone sang Happy Birthday, and he blew out his candles, making a wish. **********Dylan's POV********** As I blew out my candles, my wish was I wish I could tell Lilly how I really feel. The only problem was, I didn't know how I really felt about her. Looking at her now, I was pretty sure I knew. I could only hope that she felt the same way. Lilly, I think I love you. **********Lilly's POV********** We all watched as Dylan blew out the candles on his cake. When he finished, I smiled at him. \"What did you wish for?\" His face turned bright red. \"Umm… I… Umm…\" I laughed at his embarrassment. \"It's ok! You don't have to tell me if you don't want to!\" He glared at me with his still red face. \"If I tell you what I wished for, it won't come true.\" Outwardly, I laughed at him. Inwardly, I was thinking. That's strange. He always tells me what he wishes for. I brushed it off and helped Rosie cut the cake. After everyone ate their cake, it was time for presents. My cousin, Kelly-Also Dylan's new step mom (A/N: I know I didn't explain! Sorry!) -brought them all out. I pulled mine out of my bag. \"Sweet, presents!\" I rolled my eyes. Same old Dylan. He opened them all with vigor. His dad got him an iPod Touch, 5th Generation. He was pretty excited. Kelly got him an iTunes gift card, and Rosie baked him cookies. He just stared at the cookies and said, \"Who helped you make these, Rose?\" Rosie giggled, her brown eyes sparkling. \"Daddy did! He didn't trust me in the kitchen all by myself.\" Dylan laughed at his little sister. \"So they're edible?\" \"Of course they are! I wouldn't poison them or anything!\" Rosie told him sternly. Dylan just shrugged. \"Here, this one's from me,\" I told him, handing him the wrapped package. He took it and began carefully removing the paper. Once it was open, Dylan stared at it in shock. Sitting in his lap was a brand new sketchbook that I had made for him, with his name engraved carefully on the cover. \"Do you like it?\" I asked him, a little nervous at what he would say. He suddenly jumped up and threw his arms around me, causing a flurry of butterflies to flutter in my stomach. And that was when I knew I had made the right choice of what to get him. \"I love it! Thank you!\" He cried. \"You're welcome. I'm glad you like it,\" I replied, wrapping my arms around his neck. I saw Kelly make a kissy face at me, and I stuck my tongue out at her while I blushed. She just smirked at me. When Dylan pulled away, he smiled brightly at me, thanking me again. After that, it was time for me to go home. Dylan walked me to the door, and held it open for me. \"Good night, Lilly. See you tomorrow?\" he asked hopefully. \"Of course,\" I smiled. \"Good night, Dylan.\" With that, I headed home. As I entered my room in the back of the Jaguar café, I thought about mine and Dylan's relationship, wishing I could tell him how I really felt. Dylan, I think I love you. Don't kill me for ending it there! It's late, and I need some sleep! Review and let me know what you think![Chapter 2] Author's Note: Hey y'all! How's life? Good? That's good. I know, I know.

Sure, it's only a summer job that hasn't fully started up yet, but I've been working weekends since the end of March. So sorry I haven't updated. I'll try to do better, but no promises, sorry guys. Also, any italicized parts indicate journal/diary entries done by either Dylan or Lily. Disclaimer: I don't own We Bought a Zoo or any characters involved. I do own the laptop I'm using to write this on, and this plot line is all mine. I Think I Love You… Chapter 2: Hiding These Feelings, Part One (Lily's POV) Dear Diary, It's been two weeks since I realized my feelings for Dylan. I haven't seen him much, seeing as it's June now, and the zoo is at the busiest part of the season. I've been working hard, trying to avoid him so I don't let my feelings slip. I have no idea how he's going to take it. Will he hate me? Will things be awkward? It's questions like these that keep my feelings in the dark. I mean, I seriously don't know what to do, or how to act around him anymore. I don't think he feels the same way about me as I do about him. It's kind of a depressing thought. I have only spoken to him twice in the last two weeks, and I miss him. It's like a giant hole has been punched through my chest, and I don't think it will ever heal until I let him know how I really feel about him. How does one go about confessing their love for their best friend? Hmm… I'm not really sure. I am in need of advice right now. I would go to Kelly, but she would tease me endlessly. I mean, I know she has seen this coming. Who hasn't? I mean, besides Dylan and me. I'm sure he won't feel the same way. Would Kelly help me? Maybe, but she's been so busy I don't want to bother her. Plus, she's super stressed right now, and I'm not sure why. I mean, sure, the zoo is really busy. But we've dealt with this before, and it was much busier the year we reopened. Surely that couldn't be why she so stressed out all the time? Speaking of Kelly and weird happenings going on with her, she has been eating a lot lately. And it's pretty strange stuff. Sardines in peanut butter, when she doesn't even like sardines? Of course, she's been putting peanut butter on everything lately. And she seems to be gaining weight, particularly in the tummy area. Could she be… Nah. Not possible. Oh well. I'm off to finish my chores for the day, then off to bed I go. Maybe, before I go to sleep I will go talk to Kelly for a little while. Maybe that will ease my mind a little bit. Good night, and I will write again tomorrow, hopefully! -Lilly M. Sighing, I put my diary back in its secret place underneath my pillow. No one would ever see it there, hopefully. I slid out of my desk chair, which is right next to the head of my bed. I hurriedly ran down the stairs to finish off my chores for the night. I still had to put all of the feed away and make sure the lights in the storage rooms were off. Once I finished with my work, I made my way over to the Mee's house. I knocked lightly on the door, and it was opened to reveal a shirtless Dylan. He was only wearing a pair of sweats, so I figured he was ready for bed. It took me a moment to learn how to breathe again as I took in his slight, yet still visible, muscles. Man, he was good looking. \"Hey, Lilly. How are you? I haven't talked to you much,\" He told me, smiling in concern as my face began to heat up. \"I'm fine. Can I come in? I have to talk to Kelly for a few minutes,\" I told him. Was I imagining the disappointment in his dark brown eyes? Nah, probably not. \"Sure, come on in. You know where to find her,\" Dylan let me in, and I slid past him up to Kelly and Benjamin's room. I found Kelly in there alone, with her hands curled around her abdomen protectively. She looked up as I came in, and smiled at me. \"Hi, Lilly. What's up?\" She asked. \"Umm… Can I talk to you for a minute? I need some advice,\" I confessed, blushing. \"Okay, sweetheart. What do you need?\" She smiled at me encouragingly as I tried to figure out something to say. \"Okay, so I really, really like this guy.\" I told her. \"But I'm not sure how to tell him how I feel without pushing him away.\" Kelly tapped her chin thoughtfully, then grinned mischievously back at me. \"Does this boy happen to have dark brown hair, brown eyes, and does he live on the property?\" I gasped, though I shouldn't have been surprised. I knew that Kelly knew that I had a crush on Dylan. She probably knew before I knew myself. I felt my cheeks grow warm. \"Yeah, I really like him. But how do I tell him?\" \"Well, you could always just come right out and say it. Or you could sing it to him, seeing as you absolutely love to sing.\" she told me, and I felt myself blushing harder. I couldn't sing to him, could I? \"And you're really good, too, by the way,\" she added, smiling at me. I thought about it carefully, then nodded. \"What would I sing to him?\" I could see I had hit a road bump there. \"Well, I'm not sure. I'm sure you'll figure something out.\" I smiled and thanked her as I began to leave. \"Wait!\" She called after me, before I could leave the room completely. \"I have something to tell you.\" \"Okay.\" I said, coming to sit back down beside her on the bed. I could tell she was nervous, and a small blush covered her cheeks. \"Well…\" She began. \"I'm not sure how to tell you this, so I'm going to come right out and say it.\" I nodded, intrigued. This couldn't have anything to do with her strange eating habits and weight gain, could it? She steeled herself, and rushed out a quick sentence that I didn't understand, at all. I asked her to repeat it, slower this time. She took a deep breath and said, \"I'm pregnant.\" I jumped up, squealing, and hugged her. \"Congratulations!\" I crowed, squeezing her tight. She pulled back a moment later and smiled at me, tears of joy in her eyes. \"I've wanted a baby for so long, Lilly,\" she whispered. \"And now I get to have one, with Benjamin. I couldn't be happier.\" There was just one thing that was bothering me about this. \"You haven't told anyone about this, have you?\" I asked her. She shook her head. \"I'm not sure how they're going to take it. Benjamin and Dylan especially. I'm sure Rosie would be pleased, she's always wanted a little brother or sister.\" She took a deep breath. \"But I'm not sure if Dylan will be happy, what with his mother dying, and all. And if Dylan's not happy, Benjamin won't be happy.\" Kelly sighed in defeat. \"I don't know how to tell them.\" \"Kelly, Dylan's mom passed away years ago. Sure, he misses her and all, and wishes it were her instead of you, but he would love a baby brother or sister. I'm sure of it. And Benjamin wants a baby, too. I can see it in his eyes whenever he sees babies coming to the zoo with there parents.\" \"So, you don't mind? That there will be another kid in my life besides you?\" She seemed legitimately concerned about this, so I looked for a way to reassure her. I smiled at her and hugged her again. \"I'm happy for you, Kelly. Really, I am, And I love you.\" With that, I blew her a kiss and left the room, hearing her call and \"I love you, too,\" back to me. I walked slowly back to the Jaguar café, where my room was, thinking about everything Kelly had told me, from her advice on Dylan, to the news that she was pregnant. I smiled to myself as I entered my room from the back door. It would be fun to have a new baby around. I changed into my pajamas and turned my radio on, slowly drifting off to sleep. Right before the land of dreams took me, I heard the perfect song for me to sing to Dylan. It fit my feelings just right, and I couldn't wait to sing it for him. I then drifted off, thinking about Kelly's baby, and how excited Benjamin, Dylan, and Rosie would be when they found out. A/N: So there you go. Sorry if it didn't make much sense. It's late, and I'm kind of tired. Let me know what you think, and I'll have the next chapter out as soon as I can get it done. I love reviews, so make sure to leave one. I'll see y'all next time, and I love you all![Chapter 3] A/N: Hey guys. I know it's been a few weeks since I've updated, and I'm sorry. I just haven't felt up to it lately. I'm falling way behind in all of my classes at school, digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I can't find my way out of. Plus, I've started working weekends again at my summer job. That means no time on weekends either. One more thing, for the next two weeks I will be completing the end of level tests for my classes at school. So I will be studying and won't have time to write. Sorry. And then when the summer starts I will begin working full time. That means no time over the summer either. And finally, after that I'm off to high school. Which means tons and tons of homework each night, so no time for updates! Okay, now that you know my whole life story, on with this story. And while I'm thinking about it, I need a song for Lilly to sing to Dylan. Preferably country or pop, but any suggestions are welcomed. I have a poll up on my profile, so go vote on that for which song she will sing. If you have any other choices, let me know and I will consider them! Thanks! Now, enjoy this chapter. It takes place on the same day as the last one, except in Dylan's POV! Italicized sections are Dylan's journal entries (no, it's not girly for him to have a journal). Disclaimer: I own nothing! I Think I Love You… Chapter 3: Hiding These Feelings, Part Two (Dylan's POV) Dear Journal, I'm so confused. I think I'm in love with my best friend. Of course, she can't possibly feel the same way, can she? I mean, we've been friends for years. Am I willing to jeopardize that and tell her how I really feel? If only I could. My life would be much simpler. I have only spoken to Lilly a few times since my birthday party, and everything has been weird and awkward between us. I'm not quite sure why. Does she know how I feel? Is she just trying to let me know she's not interested? I don't have anyone to talk to about any of this either. My dad would be happy to help, but I'm sure that would be awkward. I've grown close to Kelly, but I'm not sure I could confide this in her. And Rosie is just to young. Ten years old is too young to be dealing with relationship issues. So what's a guy to do? Should I tell her how I feel, or should I just remain her friend? I need answers, and I'm not sure where to get them. I'm off to finish homework, and then maybe I will talk to my dad. I mean, he snagged my mom, and then Kelly, didn't he? He might be helpful. I'll have to see, I guess. I just don't want to be teased, because I'm sure my dad would tease me. Everyone on the zoo staff probably knows I like Lilly. Heck, I think even Rosie knows. The only one who doesn't know is Lilly. My dad should have advice. I hope. Sighing, I closed my journal and flung my head back. Why couldn't I figure this out for myself? I was letting my eyes close when I heard a knock on the door. \"Come in!\" I yelled. The door opened to reveal Rosie. \"Hey Dylan,\" she smiled. Rosie was always smiling. \"Hey, Rosie. What's up?\" I asked her. She never came up to my room unless she wanted something. \"I'm just worried about you. You've been moping around all week, and me and daddy want to know why,\" she frowned at this. I thought back to how I'd been acting. I guess I had been acting strange. \"It's nothing, really,\" I told her, trying to smile. At this, Rosie gave me her famous puppy-dog eyes. She was too cute. \"Tell me? Puh-lease?\" Finally, I relented. \"I think I'm in love with my best friend,\" I confessed. And then I couldn't stop. \"She's just so amazing, and smart, and beautiful. The thing is, I don't think she feels the same way. How could she? I'm such a dork with all of my art crap. I just-I don't know.\" Rosie just listened to me vent with an open expression on her sweet, pretty little face. My sister was going to be quite the heartbreaker when she grew up. \"You're talking about Lilly, right?\" I nodded. \"Well, I don't know about her, but I think you're pretty cool. You never know what she might think.\" I was shocked. My little sister was wise beyond her years when it came to this stuff. She was just too amazing. \"And besides, why wouldn't she like you?\" Rosie asked me innocently. She blinked at me with her big brown eyes. \"I don't know, Rosie. What do you think I should do?\" I asked her. She must know something with the way she was staring at me. \"Well, in all of the movies I've watched and all the books I've read, the main characters just confess how they feel. But they find cute ways to say it.\" With that, Rosie left, shutting the door behind her. After she left, I just sat on my bed, more confused than ever. Maybe I should talk to my dad. I stood up from my bed, shoved my journal underneath my sheets, and exited my room to find my dad. He would be able to help me. As I neared the kitchen, I heard voices. I stopped to listen. \"That's wonderful, Kelly!\" I could hear my dad exclaim. He sounded so excited. \"Really? I thought you would be mad, what with Dylan and all…\" Kelly's voice was thoughtful. What were they saying about me in there that would make her sound like that? That's when I decided to make my grand entrance. I know it's short, please don't kill me! My life is so hectic, I just couldn't even concentrate on writing. One of my favorite teachers passed away last night, and I just heard of it today. I'm a little on the depressed side at the moment. Once again, I need a song for Lilly to sing to Dylan, because it will be used next chapter(hopefully). Good night everyone, and I will update when I can.[Chapter 4] A/N: Hey everyone! I'm so, so, so sorry for the lack of updates! I tried my hardest, I really honestly did. I've just been so stressed out, what with school, ex boyfriend issues, the likes. Being a teenager seriously sucks sometimes. Well, I'm updating now, so enjoy! This chapter didn't go as I planned, but that's okay. I hope you enjoy! And please review, it would really make my day! Disclaimer: I own nothing but the plot. P.S. This chapter may not make a whole lot of sense, so I'm sorry. I haven't even read through this story in a very long time. If it helps, you may want to go back and read the other chapters. I Think I Love You Chapter Four: I'd Lie **********Dylan's POV********** \"What about me?\" I asked as I entered the kitchen. My dad and Kelly were sitting at the table. Dad was smiling, and Kelly looked worried. I was even more confused. \"Oh, Dylan!\" My dad exclaimed happily. \"Go get your sister, we have some exciting news to share with you!\" I looked at him and Kelly curiously, and was pleased with what I saw. They looked completely and truly in love. I wanted what they have someday. I gave them a small smile and turned to go get Rosie. I went to the bottom of the stairs and hollered up the stairs. \"Rosie! Come down here! Dad and Kelly have news for us!\" And with that, I headed back to the kitchen. \"She's coming,\" I told my dad and step-mom. Dad rolled his eyes. \"Really Dyl? You couldn't even walk up the stairs?\" \"Nope,\" I replied, popping the \"p\". I was saved from whatever sarcastic response my dad was about to say when Rosie came down the stairs into the kitchen. \"What is it Daddy?\" She asked in her innocent little voice. \"Come here honey. Sit down, both of you,\" Dad said. Truly intrigued, Rosie and I shared a glance as we sat down at the table. Everyone was silent. Kelly spoke before too long, ending the awkward silence that had fallen over us. \"This may be surprising for you guys to hear, especially you Dylan,\" she sent a small smile my way. \"But I'm… I'm pregnant!\" This came out with a huge grin, and I couldn't help but smile in return. Rosie was the first to say anything. \"OH MY GOSH! YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?\" she squealed, jumping up and down. Dad just laughed at her. \"Yes, honey. We're having a baby,\" Dad told her, before turning to me. \"What do you think Dyl?\" I looked him straight in the eyes and gave him a small, sad smile. \"I'm happy for you.\" Dad looked at me sadly. \"I knew you would be Dyl. I'm sorry it's not your mom, though.\" \"A small tear escaped my eye then. \"It's okay dad. It's just, I miss her,\" I confessed. And in a small whisper, I added, \"Especially now. I could really use her advice on girls.\" I glanced up to see a small smirk on my dad's face. \"I know Dyl. Now what's this about girls?\" The smirk was full-blown now, and I felt much better with the playful atmosphere. \"I think I'm gonna leave you two alone for a little while,\" Kelly said, standing. \"Come on Rosie, why don't you come help me decide themes for the nursery?\" Rosie agreed enthusiastically, and she and Kelly both left the room. Dad turned to me when they left. \"Now, I assume you've just realized that you're in love with Lilly?\" The smirk was still on his face. I felt myself start to blush. Damn it! What was Lilly doing to my head? \"Umm… Something like that…\" \"You know what you need? 20 seconds of insane courage. Just come right out and say it. That's how I snagged your mom. And then Kelly,\" He told me, looking completely sincere. I smiled. \"Thank you Dad. I'm gonna head to bed now, I think I'll talk to Lilly tomorrow morning.\" With that, I headed upstairs to my room, throwing a quick \"good night\" over my shoulder. Once in my room, I flopped onto my bed and closed my eyes, my mind filled with images of a beautiful blond-haired, blue-eyed girl. I smiled, drifting off to a peaceful sleep. **********The Next Morning, Lilly's POV********** I woke up bright and early the next day with the sun in my eyes. I guess I forgot to shut my curtain. I forced myself to roll out of bed and put on my nerdy glasses. I would worry about my contacts later. Remembering what I was going to do today, I picked out a simple yet still very cute outfit. I pulled on my favorite dark grey jeans and a sequined, light blue, ruffled tank top. It matched my eyes, so I figured, why not? Once I was dressed, I headed to the bathroom for the rest of my morning ritual. I brushed my teeth, put in my contacts, and went to work on my hair, brushing it out until there were no tangles. I also put on just a teeny bit of make up. I went back into my room and picked up my guitar, practicing my song a few times. It was one of my favorites, and it described me and Dylan pretty well. I played through it a few times until I was satisfied. Setting my guitar down, I picked up my cell phone and found Dylan's number. I clicked on it, typing a quick message. Meet me in 10 in the barn. I have to talk to you. -L.M. It didn't take long for him to reply. Ok, see you in a few J -D.M. I read his answer quickly, beginning to feel butterflies in my tummy. Nervously, I slipped on my silver ballet flats, picked up my guitar, and headed for the barn. I reached my destination with a couple minutes to spare, so I sat down on one of the old, worn chairs that me and Dyl had placed in here years ago. I pulled my guitar onto my lap and began strumming randomly. \"Hey, Lilly,\" I heard from the doorway. I glanced up from my guitar to see Dylan standing by the door with a nervous smile on his face. What could he possibly be nervous about? I was the one who was about to totally humiliate themselves by singing to the one boy that I've been in love with for who knows how long. \"Hi Dylan,\" I smiled shyly. \"Come here, I have to tell you something.\" I gestured him over to the seat next to mine and he moved to sit next to me. \"What do you need to talk to me about?\" He asked, looking at me with a concerned expression in his gorgeous brown eyes. I took a deep breath before responding. \"I'm not going to tell you, I'm going to sing it to you,\" I told him quietly, nervous. He just looked back at me with a concerned, yet confused, look on his handsome face. With that, I felt my fingers begin to play, and the first words were out of my mouth before I could even think. I don't think that passenger seat Has ever looked this good to me He tells me about his night And I count the colors in his eyes I was watching Dylan now, and I saw a confused expression looking back at me. But there was the slightest sign of recognition and almost… Relief? He'll never fall in love he swears As he runs his fingers through his hair I'm laughing cause I hope he's wrong It was then that I realized just how much I really cared for Dylan Mee. I realized that maybe I'd always liked him, and that I hoped he felt the same way. I don't think it ever crossed his mind He tells a joke I fake a smile That I know all his favorite songs And… As I flowed into the chorus, I felt myself get lost in the music. Oh, how I loved this feeling. I was completely free and relaxed when it came to my music. I could tell you his favorite color's green He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth Yes, his favorite color was green, and his birthday was the 17th of August ( A/N: I don't think this is right, but bear with me). And he was always arguing with everyone. His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes Now came the part I was most nervous about. I looked deep into Dylan's dark brown eyes and sang as sincerely as I possibly could. And if you asked me if I love him, I'd lie I saw a smile cross his face as I sang that line, but he didn't interrupt me, so I continued singing. He looks around the room Innocently overlooks the truth Shouldn't a light go on? Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long? I let myself get lost even more in the music as I poured my soul out to the 17 year old sitting next to me. He sees everything black and white Never let nobody see him cry I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine I sang the chorus again, and began to sing my favorite part of the song. It fit the closest to what I wanted him to know. He stands there then walks away My god if I could only say I'm holding every breath for you… He'd never tell you but he can play guitar I think he can see through everything But my heart I inhaled deeply as I felt a strong arm come up and wrap around my shoulders. Did this mean what I thought it did? Only time will tell. First thought when I wake up is My god he's beautiful So I put on my make up And pray for a miracle That's exactly what I had done this morning. I put on my make up, and prayed for a miracle. Now to finish this up so I can find out once and for all how Dylan feels about me. Yes I could tell you his favorite color's green He loves to argue oh and it kills me His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes And if you asked me if I love him If you asked me if I love him I'd lie When the song finished, I looked up at Dylan's face to see him in deep thought. He appeared to be arguing with himself. But then, what I had been thinking about for weeks actually happened. Dylan's arms forced me to drop my guitar, turn myself around, and rest against his muscular chest. I felt my breath catch in my throat as the next words left his oh-so-kissable lips. \"Lilly, I love you,\" he sighed, before pressing his lips ever-so-gently to mine. I was in absolute paradise. So, what'd ya think? Too short? I think it was too short, especially with how long I made you wait for this chapter. Oh well. I will update whenever I update, if you even care anymore. And to those of you who are still reading and putting up with my lack of updates, THANK YOU! I love you all! And one more thing before I go, this story could use a beta. I'm not sure how the beta thing works though, so if you're interested, and wouldn't mind explaining it to me, it would be much appreciated. Thank you, wonderful readers. Please review!

I've done some writing for school, and stuff like that, and I love reading fanfic, so I'm gonna try and write one. I saw WBAZ the other weekend, and I LOVED it. Partly because I 3 Colin Ford(Dylan), and because it was a great movie. In the movie, Dylan and Lilly were just leaning and then they: hugged ? (And WBAZ really does need more fanfics) Lily POV Dylan and I had just started dating. We were learning more and more about each other each day. He looked over at me. \"Don't you love coming up here on the roof?\" he asked. \"Of course. I feel like I'm just this small bit of the universe. It's humbling.\" I said, blushing. I'd never shared something so deep with anyone before. He smiled. \"That's how I feel too.\" He sat up and leaned back on his elbow. His brown hair fell in front of his face and he reached up to push it back. I sat up and mirrored him. \"You know, Lily, I like you. I like you a lot. You know that.\" He said, his eyes looking straight at me. \"Um, yeah. I like you too. A lot.\" I said shyly. This is it. He's going to kiss me. Omigosh. He leaned in. My heart beat so loudly, I can't be sure he didn't hear it. My palms were sweaty, my ears were ringing, and there was nothing else in the world but us. It was very sweet. His lips were soft, and warm. Not able to believe myself, I started counting. Don't over analyze it, Lilly! 1…2…..3…..4…..I Our lips moved together, his hands on my waist as I subconsciously placed my hands behind his neck. As we pulled away, I couldn't help thinking how perfect the moment was. Dylan hugged me and we laid back down, our hands entwined, as of in the distance, the stars twinkled above.[Chapter 2] A/N: Okay, so I know I forgot to add this before, but REVIEW! As it is my first fanfic, I need feedback so I can improve. Tell me what you think. I wasn't originally going to make this anything more than one chapter, but I had the idea for this chapter and it made me laugh, but I promise, nothing more after this. Onto the story… Dylan POV Dylan had to admit. He felt like the man . He felt awesome . I can't believe I actually managed to do that without screwing it up! Walking into the kitchen afterwards, I definitely had a huge grin on my face. In fact, I had a grin on my face for the rest of the night. I got a bag of popcorn, put it in the microwave and started cooking it. As I slammed the microwave door shut, I heard tires. O god, Dad's home. I mean, my dad and I were a lot better off than we were before, but I still had no intention of telling him what went down on the roof. C'mon popcorn! Cook already!Erghh I had to get the popcorn done and get to the living room before the 20 questions started again. My panicked thoughts were interrupted as Dad stepped into the house, his back turned away. Crap. Dad turned around and smiled, \"Hey Dylan! How was your da…?\" He studied my face very carefully. Ummmm…what? \"Hey Dad, did you get the new wire?\" I asked him. He leaned in close to my face and sniffed. \"Dylan, are you wearing lip gloss ?\"[Chapter 3] A/N: Hey, guys! I love the reviews. It makes me happy. At first I thought authors were exaggerating when they said how much they loved reviews, but now I know the feeling Okay, so I'm thinking of just writing a long, in-depth futurefic of DylanxLily. Thoughts? I'll start writing it soon and I'll try to post the first chapter (chapters?) this coming week! Thanks again for the reviews![Chapter 4] A/N: Okay, guys, the other story is now up. It's called Young Love: Dylan and Lily. Check it out. P.S. I will not be updating this story any more. ","Summary":" A/N: This is my first fanfic, so be nice, please!

But, Trevor and Hannah (now Trevor's girlfriend), are so addicted to knowing as much on Atlantis as possible, that Sean is starting to get a little worried.

The nephew looked over at Trevor, surprised, before whispering, \"Trevor, it's the same websites, the same articles...how do we know we'll be able to find anything?\" When he didn't get an answer, Sean, dissappointed, shut off the computer and began to look at the books around them. Hannah, on Trevor's other side, started whispering frantically, \"Guys, over here!\" She moved the screen so the others could see while Sean rushed over and Trevor looked over curiously. It was an article that talked about Atlantis, and how all the people were divinely beautiful, all children of Poseidon, yadda, yadda, yadda. Until, at the bottom, the article claimed that, after Atlantis was destroyed \"in a single day and night of misfortune\", some survivors were able to retreat to North America, and were adopted into the Cherokee Indian tribe. \"Finally,\" Trevor muttered, \"we're getting somewhere.\" Soon, research on the Cherokee indians and who would be their descendants today took over, but Sean felt it was the same as the research on Atlantis. Eventually, they found an Indian maiden who had married an Atlantean survivor. The Atlantean survivor's name could not be found, but the Cherokee maiden's name was Oliwiya Naiti. So, they looked up Oliwiya Naiti on numerous ancestry sites. They found Oliwiya's children (by the survivor), then Oliwiya's grandchildren, and so on, until they found a living descendant as of today. A girl by the name of Chrystina Krystal Trevino, who lived all the way in Colorado. \"Pack up boys,\" whispered Hannah, \"we're going to Colorado.\" Groaning, Sean shut off the computer and left the library. Trevor and Hannah, after shaking their heads doubtedly, did the same and followed Sean out of the library. Little did they know of a gentleman who had been listening to their conversation the whole time. He walked outside, took out his phone, and called him. \"She has been found. Follow them. They know where she is. Wait for instruction after you have seen her with your own eyes.\" After the reply, the gentleman hung up and looked up at the sky longingly.[Chapter 2] After a long plane ride, and getting lost a couple of times, the trio end up in front of an okay-looking building. It had paint that was chipping off, but the roof looked brand new, and so did the door. In front of the building was a sign that said 'SUNNYSIDE ORPHANAGE'. \"That has to be terrible,\" Hannah claimed, \"to have no family, and you're only a child.\" Sean nodded and added, \"Yeah. I guess I can relate to them a bit.\" Trevor, who was leading the way, pursed his lips at Sean's statement. Sean's father and Trevor's brother Max had been found dead in the center of the Earth. It was a tragic blow to find Max's body, both for uncle and nephew. But, he pushed those thoughts aside and knocked on the door. Eventually, a woman of about fifty or sixty came out. Her hair was starting to lose color, and her lips looked as though she had a bird's beak. \"May I help you?\" the woman asked sternly. Trevor answered nervously, \"Um...hi. I'm Trevor Anderson, a professor of volcanology from Washington. This is my nephew Sean, and my girlfriend Hannah Asgeirsson.\" Hannah reached out her hand to shake, but the woman did not accept so Hannah pulled it back. \"What do you want?\" the woman asked, again sternly. Trevor looked back at the two behind them before turning back to her and asking, \"May we see a ...um... Chrystina Taverno?\" Sean whispered to him, \"It's Trevino.\" The confused uncle corrected himself saying, \"Uh...Trevino. My bad.\" After a couple of long glares at all three of them, the woman finally claimed, \"Come in.\" As soon as the three were seated in the living room, the woman called upstairs, \"Brat! You have visitors!\" Trevor looked over and saw that Hannah had a confused look on her face. \"What's wrong?\" Trevor asked. Hannah looked over at Trevor and claimed, \"Oh, nothing. Just that...why did she call her brat?\" As if on cue, the woman walked up to them and claimed, \"Do not be surprised if Ms. Trevino is nothing but a brat to you. She is the most troublesome in this orphanage, and not surprisingly, I cannot wait to be rid of that girl.\" Before either could respond, a beautiful girl walks into the room, and the old woman leaves. \"Can I help you?\" the girl asks, with caution in her tone as she eyed each of the trio suspiciously. Trevor stood and asked, \"You are Chrystina Krystal Trevino?\" The girl raised her eyebrows and claimed, \"They call me Chrys. Who are you?\" Trevor cleared his throat and replied, \"I'm...uh...Trevor Anderson, a professor of...\" \"Yeah, I heard all of that a while ago. You told Ms. Buttercup at the doorstep,\" she explained. Sean suddenly asked with a weird expression in his voice, \"Ms. Buttercup?\" Chrys shrugged and replied defeatedly, \"Well, what can you do?\" Trevor heaved a sigh and then asked, \"Look, we're just here to ask you a question or two. Nothing serious, but it does have something to do with your heritage.\" Chrys raised an eyebrow and repeated doubtfully, \"My...heritage.\" Trevor nodded and continued, \"Yeah, your heritage. You know, your ancestry...\" Chrys interrupted, \"I know what a heritage is. But what is there about it that makes you want to see me? In case you haven't noticed, I am not the kind of person that should be loved.\" Hannah, sighing, walked over to Ms. Buttercup and asked kindly, \"Is there any place where we, I mean the four of us, can talk privately? Because this is actually a personal matter.\" After a long glare, Ms. Buttercup finally answered, \"Fine. You shall use the back porch. I shall lead you there.\" Within five seconds they were sitting comfortably in the chairs on the back porch. Ms. Buttercup still watched but from the kitchen window and the windows were closed. Relieved at being free (sort of ) from the hawk-like woman, Trevor started explaining. \"Well, the reason we are here is because...well...have you heard of the legendary continent of Atlantis?\" This brought Chrys' attention. \"Yeah,\" she answered, \"what about it?\" Trevor sighed, doubtful if she will believe what he is about to say, then replies, \"Well, we have been doing research on Atlantis. We came up with a file that claimed that the survivors of Atlantis had been adopted into the Cherokee Indian nation. A survivor married one of the Cherokee women and now, based on our research, we have found you as their last living descendant.\" There was a little silence before Chrys finally asked in a cautious tone, \"Do you have proof?\" Trevor looked over at Hannah, who shrugged. Then, Trevor looked over at Sean, who got the idea and reached into his bag. He took out a packet of papers that had been printed out from the library and gave them to Chrys. Sure enough, the papers claimed that she was one of Atlantean blood. Chrys handed back the papers and asked, again cautiously, \"Okay, so what do you want?\" Sean actually answered that question. As he put the papers carefully back into the bag, he answered, \"Well, we hoped that, maybe, you might be able to help us find Atlantis.\" Chrys immediately was taken back. She remarked, \"Okay, look, just because I have Atlantean blood doesn't mean that I know where it is.\" Trevor was about to say something when Hannah cut in, \"Well, actually, our research claims that the society of Atlantis had psychic powers. They had uses of crystals to guide them to whatever they need to do.\" Sean added, \"And since I actually know that that pendant around your neck is a crystal, you might be able to help us.\" Chrys immediately put her hand up to her crystal pendant. Trevor and Hannah looked over at Sean, surprised that he said something like that. Chrys snapped the crystal off the necklace and looked at it. In awe, she explains, \"This crystal pendant was actually my mom's. It was the last of her belongings and I didn't want to lose it. She wore it all the time, though I never really knew why.\" Trevor walked over to Chrys as she snapped the pendant back into place and said to her, \"All we want is to find Atlantis and see it with our own eyes. We believe you can help us. But just because you can, doesn't mean you have to. Will you help us find the lost continent of Atlantis?\" Chrys thought for a good minute before replying, \"Yes.\" Soon, they were in a submarine heading to find the lost civilization. A/N: I just decided to stop right here because I would just take up 10,000 pages before the chapter was done if I didn't. So, for now, enjoy!

General Vak certainly knew how to entertain mercenaries . Vak had a 1000 square foot room , with drink trays and computers off to one corner . \" You're here \" said Vak , who walked in – with a stickman ? No . they weren't real. But that was a live stickman in the shadows . He had sunglasses and a cap . \" You might have noticed Agent Sniper \" Vak said . \" Another attempt at the Ghost Serum , which allowed the injected to do super – natural things . the first successful attempt was Ethan Hunt , now our top agent .

General Vaktovich was there , on time . \" So whats the plan , Vak \" Miranda asked the Russian . He was never one to reply . \"And where's Sniper ? '' \" Agent Hunt will be escorting you . \" \" You mean ETHAN hunt ? the most best superly agent in the whole wide world ? \" '' Yes , Agent ETHAN Hunt will be escorting you .

A few hours later , Miranda stared at the most deadly car ever built . The jet black Bugatti , from what Miranda had heard , was the most deadly car ever built . The front opened into a forest of miniguns and rocket launchers . The lights sported laser guns . The top and doors had flip-up 50. caliber machine guns , and ground -to - air missiles . The wheels could expel caltrops , spikes , and even heavy machine guns . The back had a portable variety of missiles and the wheels could pop up after being popped . The titanium - iridium - diamond - steel alloy was military grade ( even more ) and could survive a nuclear blast . The vehicle could go at 1000 m per hour , faster than a Corvette . This was the ultimate weapon . Even more features - the front could spit even more caltrops , the indestructible alloy could open to reveal a nuclear missile - last case scenario - the two top exhaust vents actually fired ion missiles , the glass was missile-proof and came with HUD screens on the viewport , back , and even car windows . It also had flamethrowers and heat missiles . The car had titanium grappling hooks , cobalt- egded saws , and a magnetic tread . It also had a automated security system . It could survive missile launchers and it had its own remote control . Besides that , a rack of AIM-120 AMMRAAMs hovered on the front , blasting any potential targets . MBDA5 Meteors and R-14 Bisnovats were also on duty . Miranda couldn't take it . She jumped inside the car . It felt like a normal car , but bristling with fia-power . ! \" Come on , she told the Black Guard . This is gonna be fun ![Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Arrival. I'm having fun with the gadgets – very surprising. There is a coffee holder, and a hair dryer – lots of fun stuff. Then, Vaktovich's face appears onscreen. \"About time. If you aren't done fooling around with the electronic head displays we need to talk\". The Russian's face is screwed strangely. \"Your mission: retrieve the Xenomorph Empress the Matriarch from Weyland-Yutani, and, as a bonus, kill Carl Bishop Weyland. Another thing: he's not a bot. Shaddix makes the first sound. \"Seriously, General? You expect a half alien girl, a team of highly trained assassins , and a stickman to capture a Xenomorph Empress , kill Carl Bishop Weyland , and get out alive ? No . Way . This is even worse than My Life As A Joke , and that was pretty bad\". I notice there's a sharp edge to his normal annoying and sleazy voice . \"You will do it , or no cash\". Vaktovich growls . And with that , his face vanishes . Shaddix stares at Grid . \"You know , that Russian is gonna get killed ? Sniper , apparently not happy with the seating arrangement – Dyson drives , I ride shotgun – with shotgun in hand – and Sniper is cramped up in the backseat with Grid and Wolf ,- just says \"Vak knows what he's doing . Let him be . \"Really , let him be ? You just protect him . All you do is snipe at random people – although you do a better job than Katniss Everdeen , I heard ,\" Shaddix retorts . Then , the monitor starts beeping . \" Everybody ,\" says Dyson , \" Say hello to Weyland Yutani . Weyland Yutani is huge . Like , I mean huge . It is so huge I can't describe it . Well , maybe I can – huge black building with WEYLAND YUTANI spelled on it , armed guards at the huge doorway . \"This is where we ditch the car\" , Shaddix replies . Sniper slides out like a shadow and takes out an official looking rifle . The guard halts our passage . I hold out paperwork . \"Ok.\" The door slides open . We walk into the darkness . We walk down long tunnels and hallways , sliding between doors and passages . Finally , there is a small metal door . It says : CARL BISHOP WEYLAND . We enter . A man with an absurd face is sitting in a chair . So that is Weyland . \" Welcome to Weyland Yutani . I am Carl Bishop Weyland .[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Miranda \"You murderer!\" Miranda yelled. The guards came at lightning speed, jumping at her from all angles. Meanwhile, Dyson had dispatched a guard by slicing his disc through his head. Shaddix and Grid fended off two guards armed with electro-staffs. And Wolf had buried his katana deep into three guards already. Miranda kicked the guard that attacked her in the face. Where was Weyland? Just then, another guard jumped at her. She smashed her knee into his face, and he crumpled to the ground. Just then, Wolf cut off the head of the last guard. Shaddix sighed. \"Do we always have to fight people bent on killing us?\" \"Be quiet, Shaddix. We gotta go find Weyland and cave his face in.\" Dyson, ever so deep from his Black Guard helmet, responded \"Well, where did you last see him?\" \"At his desk, than he vanished and all these guards came out of nowhere.\" Dyson strode over to the desk. He kicked it, and it folded back, revealing a set of steps which led downward to somewhere, Miranda guessed. \"Well, we gotta go down there, if we're gonna find Weyland,\" Miranda retorted. And so the team went down there, starting their search for the infamous Weyland.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Dyson Dyson and his cohorts marched down the steps. It was dank and certainly humid, with a bit of sewer mixed together. \"Wait a moment.\" It was that stick figure Sniper. He had vanished when they were fighting the guards, and now he was there. \"'Sup guys? Having fun?\" Dyson growled, but it was cut short as the entrance to the steps slid shut over them. \"Now we'll never get out...\" moaned Shaddix, but Grid slapped him. \"Dude, the only way to get out is to keep going…\" Dyson stepped on another one of the ice-cold steps. Jeez, these were COLD. Like freeze-your-feet-off cold. But they didn't, so he kept trudging on. \"How much longer do I have to spend in this hellhole!?\" Shaddix whimpered. This time Dyson slapped him. \"STOP MOANING!\" Saying that was a mistake. They heard a hiss, and another hiss, and a roar. Then a Xenomorph landed in front of them, hissing and growling. \"AAAAAHHHHHH! IT'S A GODFORSAKEN XENOMORPH!\" Dyson tackled the thing and both beings tumbled down the ice-cold stairs. Dyson punched the Xenomorph in the head, while the thing tried to stab him using its tail. As it was spitting acid, he grabbed its ridged neck and snapped it. This rang with an audible CRACK. Slightly panting, Dyson threw the corpse aside. \"Oh shoot.\" There was a Praetorian Xenomorph and several Xenomorph Warriors. \"Attack!\" the Xenomorph commander hissed telepathically. Fortunately Grid tackled the commander and both fell in a writhing heap. Shaddix punched the beast fifteen times. The Praetorian groaned and grabbed Shaddix. Shaddix yelled and kicked the thing in the ribs. It kept its deadly lock on him, but it kept him subdued. Meanwhile the rest of the team engaged the Warriors in combat. Dyson overturned one which rushed at him. Wolf attacked and defeated another Warrior. Grid and Miranda brought down another Warrior, and the last one was tranquilized by Sniper with a well-aimed shot to the head. Everyone rushed down to assist Shaddix, who by then, had subdued the Praetorian, handcuffed it, and roughly pushed it against the wall. \"Who are you?\" Miranda asked the Xenomorph. \"Why should I tell you, foul human? You came here only to destroy my hive… or did you?\" The Xenomorph replied telepathically. \"No, we're not. We're going to free your hive from Weyland.\" \"Really. Well then, my name is Marcus, and I will take you to my leader.\" Shaddix released the Praetorian. He was larger than any Praetorian Dyson had ever seen. He was almost as tall as a Queen, being about thirteen feet tall. He had a long scar across his crest. He was greyer than any other Praetorian he'd ever seen. \"Follow me, then.\" And the Praetorian walked off into the steps, followed by the team.[Chapter 7] Meeting the Hive Marcus, the Praetorian Xenomorph, led them to a huge antechamber. It was covered with thick Xenomorph webbing. Xenomorphs were all over the place, climbing the walls, nursing chestbursters, and socializing with other Xenomorphs. Suddenly, all the heads turned towards him. Marcus groaned telepathically. The onlookers included infant chestbursters, small drones, Warriors, large Warriors, a few Predaliens, and even a few Queens. But one Xenomorph towered over the rest: a gigantic, grey, chained Xenomorph Queen, illuminated by some fires, making the Queen look yellowish. It stared at them, and an ancient voice issued from the walls. \"Who dares, even thinks, about violating the sanctity of my hive?\" Miranda had no answer to that. \"Well, General Vaktovich sent us to, well, kill you, because he fears your hive may escape while being held captive.\" \"SEE?\" the Queen thundered. \"DESTROY THEM!\" \"No comment.\" Dyson said. And he ran. Yelling over his shoulder, he said \"There's no way you can beat a bazillion Xenomorphs! Run for it! Miranda, Shaddix, Grid, and Wolf were suddenly surrounded by snarling Xenomorphs. Marcus sighed. \"I wish you'd have freed our hive. We're much more intelligent, you know\". And he pounced. Luckily, Sniper saved the day. Appearing out of nowhere, he pulled a large hunting rifle and jabbed Marcus in the chest. A Warrior Xenomorph attacked. Sniper shot a tranquilizer dart at the monster, which struck it in the face. Miranda yelled \"STOP!\" The Xenomorph waves kept coming. They were now surrounded by Xenomorphs. Sniper growled. \"We're screwed.\" A screeching war cry sounded, and Dyson leapt into action, punching and kicking Xenomorphs, sending them tumbling. Marcus leaped at him, but Grid punched the Praetorian in the face. Marcus flew five feet and rolled to a stop. He got up, and charged. Meanwhile, Shaddix and Grid were separated from the group. They attacked Xenomorphs furiously, but they were being driven to a wall. As for Dyson, Wolf, and Miranda, they were fending off Marcus and some Xenomorphs. Sniper stood on a ruined pillar, putting Xenomorphs to sleep with tranquilizer darts. Then, they heard a low-pitched roar. A Queen had separated itself from its egg sack, and charged, tossing lower-caste Xenos out of the way, screeching as she went. She swung her two primary arms at Miranda, who was caught and tossed. \"Ouch!\" Miranda screamed. The two secondary arms picked up some sharp rock slabs and started to stab at the Queen. She roared, and caught Dyson in the chest with her left primary hand. She started to open her mouth, but Shaddix jumped on the Queen's large head crest, and started slicing with his disc. She roared, flung her head, and Shaddix was tossed all the way at the feet of another, smaller Queen, which started to tear its egg sack off. Shaddix scrambled to his feet, avoiding marauding lesser Xenomorphs to join the battle against the fighting Queen. The huge Queen roared encouragement at the Xenomorphs and screeched at the combatants. Meanwhile, the fighting Queen was getting the advantage. Spewing fire-acid at the fighters, it was quickly tiring them down. Shaddix's helmet caught on fire. \" YOWZA!\" He ran around, screaming like an idiot. The fighting Queen snapped her tail, and Grid was sent flying through the air. Sniper appeared out of the shadows, right on the Queen's head, but the Queen grabbed Sniper. Sniper shot a tranquilizer dart, but it simply bounced off the Queen's head. It growled, and prepared to eat Sniper. Suddenly, bright lights shined down on the vast antechamber. Raw meat was dropped down, steak, sausage, ham, and others. Xenomorphs hungrily began consuming some, while most of the meat was brought before the Queens and the huge Queen. The fighting queen set down Sniper to feast on a pig carcass. Sniper sighed. \"So what? Are you gonna fight as soon as you're done eating?\" The Queen turned around, blood on her mouth. \" Well, the Matriarch-\" gesturing to the huge Queen, \" will accept your offer, as long as you don't try to kill me, Zeta-\" gesturing to the small Queen, \"Bahlaks, or the Matriarch.\" The whole team walked to the Matriarch, dodging the lights. Finally, they disappeared. The ancient Xenomorph turned its head towards the team, and groaned. \" Are you sure you want to free me? I may kill you, or the rest of the Hive.\" Miranda scoffed. \"Don't delude yourself with visions of power. And, Xenomorphs have been human allies before. Your Queen Mother, ruler of the Xenomorph Empire, allied with a Predator and a human before.\" The Matriarch snarled. \" That Queen Mother is dead. She was Kazmir the Great, expanded the Xenomorph Empire's control over the galaxy 55-B67, and reformed our governmental system. Nevertheless, Kazmir was killed in a skirmish against human soldiers. That is truly saddening. To ally yourself with a human, and die because of humans? However, we have not chosen a new Queen Mother. For 50 years, we have debated the succession, with either me, Acheron the Victorious, Kazmir's daughter Marlachek, or Hruthon of BG-386 as Queen Mother.\" Miranda raised her hand. \" Yes, I know, ever since the explosion of the Farlak Orb, Xenomorphs have become intelligent, reorganized their dominion, and are an official political entity, controlling millions of worlds. But, I do not need to hear about Xenomorph politics. Too boring.\" The Matriarch snarled. \"Fine. Let us get to the point. The deal: My freedom, in exchange for me not killing you.\" Miranda scoffed, again. \" That's hardly a fair deal! Kazmir the Great would never do such a thing!\" The Matriarch roared. \" Though it is true that during her reign, Kazmir the Great allied the Xenomorph Empire with the humans, before she allied herself with the human Caryn, Kazmir attempted to kill her! This proved that Kazmir allied herself with the Caryn because the human threatened to kill Kazmir's successor, Marlachek the Wise, so Kazmir allied the Xenomorph Empire out of protection! IF the alliance was not, Xenomorph Prime, our sacred homeworld, would be invaded, and Kazmir killed!\" Miranda smirked. \" Ha! This proves that the Xenomorph Empire was weak! They had to agree to a treaty, otherwise humans would raze the capital of your empire, Xenoopolis, to the ground!\" The Matriarch sighed, then responded \" Fine, what is your bargain?\" Miranda twirled her fingers, and said \" Ok, your freedom in exchange for rampaging this facility. And, no getting killed.\" The Matriarch smiled, at least how Xenomorphs smile. A bare, toothy grin spread across the Matriarch's face. \" That, we can do.\" \"Oh, and one more thing. How does the Xenomorph Empire expand? And is there any, you know, any tributary states, or anything?\" The Matriarch burped, then responded. \"In the old days, there was mindless expansion. Eggs would get on ships, facehuggers would hatch, and there you go. Under the reign of Wotan the Magnificent, the Farlak Orb exploded. We were suddenly… more intelligent. We carefully infested ships, and spread the empire. There are no vassal states, as we have no need for goods. All we need is sufficient meat. We do not require hosts, as now, we just lay an egg, and a chestbursters comes out. Does that answer your question?\" \"Well, as a matter of fact, it does.\" \"Let's go!\" Dyson, who had been listening, tossed a disc at the chain. Grid threw his staff, which bounced off another chain. It collapsed. Wolf threw two at the leg chains, and Shaddix finished it off with another disc to the chest chain. The Matriarch ripped herself free from her gigantic egg sack, and stretched her arms. All four of them. \"Finally, I am free! Now, let us destroy this building!\" Xenomorphs screeched and headed for the stairs. Dyson sighed. \"Well, I guess, lets go!\" And they went.

We were both hovering our hands over the light, while gazing up at the stars. \"Ha, who knew laying up here, playing with a flashlight, could be so entertaining?\" Dylan chuckled. \"When I was little, Kelly and I would lay up here. I'd try to count the stars,\" I said. \"How high did you count, before you lost track?\" he asked. \"Usually I'd only make it up to 50, but the highest I've made it was 127,\" I answered. \"Wow, how old were you?\" he questioned. \"8,\" I answered, again. \"Nice,\" he smiled. \"Yeah,\" I smiled back. I shiver ran up my spine. Dylan must've noticed it. \"You cold?\" he asked. \"Kinda',\" I replied. \"Here,\" he said, handing me his hoodie. \"Aren't you going to be cold?\" I asked, concerned. \"No,\" he answered. \"Now put it on,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I giggled, pulling it on over my head. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yeah, thanks, Dyl,\" I thanked. \"No probelm, you want to listen to music?\" he questioned. \"Sure,\" I responded.

Why didn't you tell me you could sing?\" the words just poured out of me. \"Sorry, it never really came up,\" he shrugged. \"And that song, that song was adorable!\" I gushed. \"Yeah, I started listening to it when I met you,\" he admitted. \"Do you practice what you say, or does it just come to you?\" I asked, jokingly. \"Yeah, I practice on Rosie,\" he joked. \"I knew it,\" I went along with it. \"I love you,\" he chuckled, shaking his head. \"I love you more,\" I replied. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I said, with the biggest grin ever. \"Well then,\" he said, before leaping over and tickling me. \"Stop,\" I giggled. \"Not until you say I love you more,\" he laughed back. \"Okay, I love you more,\" I repeated, purposly missing the meaning of what he said. \"Okay, say Dylan loves Lilly more,\" he ordered, still tickling me. \"Okay, okay. Dylan loves Lilly more. There, you happy?\" I asked, as he stopped his tickling torture. \"Very,\" he smirked. When we finally settled down, I snuggled close to Dylan. My head was on his shoulder, my left arm was around his neck as my right was around his ribs. Both of his arms encircled my torso. 'Remembering Sunday' by All Time Low came on, and before I knew it I was fast asleep in Dylan's arms. Dylan's POV After 'Remebering Sunday' I realized Lilly was asleep. I turned off the flashlight. I pused a stray lock of hair behind her ear, and kissed her forehead. \"Goodnight and sweet dreams, Beautiful,\" I whispered. Soon after that I drifted off to my own sweet dreams. Kelly's POV I woke up in the morning, and walked over to Ben's house. I knocked on the door, and he was quick to answer. \"Hey, did Lilly come in last night?\" he asked, as he opened the door. \"No, I was about to ask you if you've seen her. Why?\" I asked. \"Dylan didn't come in either,\" he answered. \"Where do you think they could be?\" I questioned. \"I don't know, let's go look,\" Ben ordered. I was walking around the jaguar cafe' when I saw a flashlight on the roof. I climbed up to get it. \"Ben, come up here. You're going to want to see this,\" I called. He was up here in 30 seconds. \"Well, you found Lilly and Dylan,\" Ben pointed out. Lilly and Dylan were laying, asleep, on the roof. Dylan had his hands around her stomache. Lilly, in Dylan's hoodie, had one arm around Dylan's neck, and the other around his torso, and her head on his shoulder. \"You don't think?\" Ben asked. \"Oh, I think Lilly and Dylan are dating,\" I agreed. Just then Lilly and Dylan woke up. The both jumped when they saw us. \"Hey, Dad. Hi, Kelly,\" Dylan said, cautiously. \"Hey, Kids. Is there something you two aren't telling me and Ben?\" I asked. \"Busted?\" Dylan asked. \"So busted,\" Ben answered, chuckling. Everyone started smiling, and soon all four of us were laughing. Sorry if this sucked, but it's my first We Bought A Zoo fanfic. This is a disclaimer for any and all WBAZ fnfic I write Hope you enjoy! :)[Chapter 2] Dylan's POV It was the night before the first day of school. Everyone, except us, were at a employee bonfire. Lilly and I were sitting in my living room, on the couch, watching a movie. \"Are you excited for tomorrow?\" I asked. This was going to be Lilly's first year in a real school, and because she's so smart she's taking 9th grade classes with me. \"Excited is an understatment. I finally get to go to a real school. With people my age, or older I should say,\" she explained. \"Yeah, but I'm warning you, people at school can be mean. Especially girls,\" I cautioned. \"I'm not scared. You'll be there, and that's all I need to make it through the day,\" she smiled. \"Good, and let me know if any guys hit on you. Okay?\" I said. \"I promise,\" she rolled her eyes, giggling. \"Plus, since we're in the same grade I can show you to your classes, instead of some random jerk,\" I joked. \"Yeah. I'd rather have my boyfriend show me around, instead of some jerk,\" she agreed. Her smile was so beautiful. I took a chance, and I leaned in. When she saw me, she started to lean in. Our eyes, simultaniously, shut and our lips connected. When we were kissing I had my hands on her waist, as hers were linked around my neck. We started leaning back, so I was on top of her. I felt her toung swipe my lips. I immediatly granted her acecess. When we pulled back, I started to kiss her neck. After about a minute of that, I sat up. She followed me. \"Wow,\" we both whispered. \"Good thing Rosie's not here,\" I laughed. \"I know,\" she agreed, giggling. Then we continued watching the movie. When the movie was over, I saw her sleeping, her head on my shoulder. I carried her up to my room, and tucked her into my bed. I changed into my pj's and went to sleep on the couch. *Morning* Lilly's POV I woke up in Dylan's bed. I must've fallen asleep watching the movie. I got up, and went downstairs. Dylan was sitting at the table, eating. He was still in his pajamas. \"Morning, Beautiful,\" he greeted, when I entered. \"Morning,\" I blushed, kissing his on the cheek. \"I was going to wake you up after I was done eating,\" he infromed. \"Well, you don't have to now,\" I stated, yawning. I put some bread in the toaster, and sat next to him. \"Kelly brought you clothes. They're sitting in a bag on the coffee table,\" he explained. \"Thanks,\" I thanked. My toast popped. I ate it, and went into the bathroom to change. Dylan was sitting on the couch when I walked into the living room. \"Ready to go, Gorgeous?\" he asked. \"Ready,\" I smiled. \"Okay,\" he said, taking my hand. We walked out to the car. His dad got in, and drove us to school. \"Have fun, and be good,\" called. \"We will,\" Dylan and I promised. We walked into school, hand-in-hand. \"Well, little Dylan has a girlfriend,\" some kid smirked. He was around 5' 6'', a little chubby, and black spikey hair. \"Yeah, Rick, this is Lilly. Lilly, this is Rick,\" Dylan introduced. \"Hi,\" I smiled. \"Hey,\" he greeted, holding out his hand. I took it. \"I'll see you later, Rick,\" Dylan said. \"Bye,\" I said. \"Later,\" Rick said. \"He seems nice,\" I commented. \"Yeah, he's really funny, too,\" Dylan added. \"Any other friends I should meet?\" I asked. \"Only Alex, but I can introduce you two in homeroom,\" he replied. \"Okay,\" I smiled. We walked into 's room, and sat in two empty desks next to each other. Then a guy who's probably 5' 5'', thin, and has short blond hair sat behind Dylan. \"Hey, Alex, what's up?\" Dylan asked. \"Nothing much,\" Alex replied. \"This is my girlfriend, Lilly,\" Dylan infromed. \"Hey, Lilly, nice to meet you,\" Alex held out his hand, smiling. \"Hey, Alex,\" I greeted, taking his hand. \"She's really pretty, Dylan,\" Alex commented. \"I know,\" Dylan smiled. \"Thanks,\" I smiled. Dylan's POV \"Attention class,\" said. \"We have a new student. Her name is Miss Lillian Miska. Come up here Miss Miska,\" she ordered. Lilly stood up, and walked into the front of the class. \"Hi, I'm Lilly,\" she said, quietly. \"Everyone introduce yourselfs,\" she ordered. Alex and I were the last to introduce ourselves. \"I'm Alexander Roland,\" Alex announced. \"I'm Dylan Mee,\" I said, with the biggest smile I've ever worn. Soon we went to first period. Lilly and I have the same scheduel. Finally, luch rolled around. Lilly and I got our lunches, and went to sit down. That's when things got ugly. Lilly accidently ran into Kiara Lamare', the 'most popular girl in school'. \"Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry,\" Lilly apologized. \"Oh, new girl,\" she sneered. \"Let's go sit down,\" I suggested, to Lilly. \"No, it's okay. I'm just going to return the favor,\" Kiara said. She took my milk, and poured it all over Lilly. She started crying and ran out of the luch room. I threw Kiara my tray, and ran to catch up with her. I finally caught her, and I pulled her into a hug. She cried into my chest. \"It's okay, Baby. Sh, it's alright,\" I comforted. We were just leaning up into the lockers, her crying. Then the bell for 6th period rang. She wiped her eyes, and we went to math. Eventually, the day was over. We went outsid, and dad picked us up. Lilly's POV Dylan and I got into her dad's car. \"So, how was your first day?\" asked. \"Okay,\" Dylan and I replied, in unision. \"Were people nice?\" he asked me. \"Some,\" I answered. \"Good,\" he said, then we were off, back to the zoo. When we got home, Dylan and I went to the jaguar cafe' to do our homework. \"Don't you want to change or get a shower before homework? Because of the milk?\" Dylan asked. \"Yeah, I'll get a shower, and change into my pajamas. Then, we can do homework. You can make us an after school snack, while I'm gone,\" I suggested. \"Okay,\" he smiled. \"Good,\" I said. I went, and took a shower. I put on black sweatpants and a white cami. I pulled my hair back in a bun, and went to the main part of the cafe'. \"Back,\" I called, as I walked in. \"Hey, missed you,\" he said. \"Missed you, too, in that 20 minutes,\" I giggled. \"Yeah, 20 minutes is a long time,\" he chuckled. \"You ready for homework?\" I asked. \"Not really,\" he rolled his eyes. \"I'll give you kiss after we do our homework,\" I bargained. \"Okay,\" he smirked, picking up a pencil. *One hour later* \"Are you done yet?\" Dylan asked. \"Yep, I just finished,\" I answered. \"And done,\" he said. \"Thank God, we're done!\" I cheered. \"Now?\" Dylan smirked, raising an eyebrow. \"Yes,\" I nodded. I sat on his knee, and I kissed him. One hand cupped my face, while she other held my waist so I wouldn't fall. My hands were planted on his shoulders. Then we pulled back. \"There's your homework kiss,\" I stated. \"Your hair is so soft,\" he pointed out, twisting a loose strand of my hair that fell out of the bun. \"Thanks,\" I giggled. We went up to my room to study for a history test we're going to have on Friday. We studied forever. Before we knew it, it was sundown. \"I better get going,\" Dylan said, standing. \"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow,\" I said, standing up, and wrapping my arms around his neck. \"Love you,\" he said, putting his hands on my waist. \"Love you too,\" I returned. We kissed, and we pulled back. \"Goodnight, Beautiful,\" he said, and then he left. I layed down and fell asleep, thinking about my first day of real high school.[Chapter 3] This is set before Dylan told Lilly I love you. Hope you like and review :) Dylan's POV I was sitting at the kitchen table, drawing in my sketch book. \"Hey, Dylan, whatcha' doing?\" Rosie, my little sister, asked. \"Drawing,\" I answered. \"Drwaing what?\" she questioned. \"None of your business,\" I replied. \"Dad!\" she yelled. \"Dylan, please, just show your sister what you're drawing, unless it's violent,\" Dad odered. So, I uncovered the page and let my sister look and my drawing. It said 'Lilly' in big bubble letters, and there was a heart where the dot in the 'i' should be. \"Ooh,\" she sang. \"Yeah, now give it back, and don't tell anyone,\" I commanded. \"I won't, on one condition,\" she said. \"What?\" I asked. I knew that devious grin she had on. \"You have to tell Lilly,\" she stated. \"Tell Lilly what?\" I questioned, confused. \"You have to tell Lilly you like her,\" she cleared. \"I don't like her,\" I defended. \"Yes, Dylan, you like her,\" she pryed. \"No, I don't like her,\" I insisted. \"I love her,\" I admitted. Her chin dropped to the floor. \"Well, don't just sit here, go tell her!\" Rosie demanded. \"What if she doesn't love me back, or get's weirded out?\" I, nervously, asked. \"That won't happen, trust me. Now go,\" she reassured. \"Okay,\" I rolled my eyes. I ran all the way to Lilly's place, which wasn't so easy because it was pouring. I knocked on the front door. Lilly answered. \"Hey, Dylan,\" Lilly greeted, shyly. I remembered what my dad said, about the 20 seconds of courage. I put my hands on her shoulders, and I kissed her. \"I love you,\" I told her, as soon as we pulled back. She just wrapped her arms around my neck, and kissed me. I put my hands on her waist, and kissed her back. Rosie was right, she did love me.[Chapter 4] Lilly's POV I woke up, it was beautiful spring morning. I got a shower and got dressed. I was wearing jean shorts, a white cami, a green t-shirt I stole from Dylan tied up to my waist, and grey converse. I pulled my hair back into a pony tail and went downstairs. \"Morning, Kelly,\" I greeted. \"Morning, Lilly. Are you and Dylan doing something today?\" she asked. \"Yeah, is driving us and Rosie down to the park a mile down the road,\" I answered. \"What time are you leaving?\" she questioned. \"After lunch, and we'll be back arond 6,\" I replied. \"Okay, have fun,\" she said. \"I will,\" I promised. I ate breakfast. An hour later, I walked over to Dylan's house, and I knocked on the front door. Rosie appeared behind the door. \"Hi, Lilly,\" she greeted. \"Hey, Rosie, you ready to go to the park?\" I asked. \"Yeah, you want to see Dylan?\" she questioned. \"Please and thank you,\" I replied. \"Dylan, your girlfriend's here to see you,\" she yelled. Dylan stepped out onto the porch a few seconds later. \"Hi,\" I said. \"Hey, Lil,\" he greeted. \"I'm so excited about the park. I haven't been there in years,\" I stated. \"Ha, you look cute. Wearing my shirt,\" he complimented. \"Thanks,\" I giggled. \"Welcome,\" he chuckled. \"What do you want to do before we go?\" I asked, sitting down. \"We can play random questions, would you rather, or just talk,\" he suggested, sitting in the chair next to me. \"Random questions. You go first,\" I replied. \"Okay, do you want to have a boy or girl frist?\" he asked. \"Boy,\" I answered. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Simple, if I have a boy first, my little girl could have an intimidating older brother,\" I replied. \"Nice, your trun,\" he stated. \"What is your ideal wedding song, for the first dance?\" I asked. \"Either 'I Wouldn't Mind' by He Is We or 'Forever and Always' by Parachute,\" he answered. \"I love both of those!\" I exclaimed. \"Cool, what would you name your kids, boy and girl?\" he questioned. \"Boy: Jarrod Hunter. Girl:Jeydon Grace,\" I replied. \"Cute,\" he commented. \"Thanks,\" I gushed. \"You kids ready to go?\" asked, stepping onto the porch with Rosie. \"Ready, Dad,\" Dylan replied. \"Good, let's go,\" he ordered. We all climed into the car. driving, Rosie up front with him, and me and Dylan in the back. The drive was probably 20 minutes. Dylan and I listened to music on his ipod. We listened to 'Just a Girl' Click 5, 'She's a Lady' Forever the Sickest Kids, 'Scars' Papa Roach, 'A Trophy Father's Son' Sleeping With Sirens, and 'Forever and Always' Parachute. That's mine and Dylan's song. Finally, we arrived at the park. dropped us off, told us to be good and for Dylan to watch Rosie, and he'd be back at 5. Then he left. \"Hey, Rose, do you think you'll be okay hanging here for a little? Lilly and I are going to go down by the creek. Yell if you need us,\" Dylan said, before we walked down to the creek. We were skipping rocks. Dylan's POV Lilly and I are down by the creek skipping rocks. She looks adorable, with little strands of hair in her face that fell out of her pony tail, the way my shirt is tied up and baggy on her, they way she smiles, everything. When we finish skipping rocks, we sit on the bank. \"That was fun,\" she said, excitedly. \"Yeah, it was,\" I agreed. \"We need to do this more often,\" she stated. \"I know, I haven't had this much fun in a couple years,\" I laughed. \"Why are you laughing?\" she asked, giggling. \"You look so cute,\" I said. \"How does that make you laugh?\" she questioned, raising an eyebrow. \"Because I can tell you you look cute, adorable, amazing, beautiful, and whatever else, but I can't do this,\" I explained, as I leaned over. We were both laying down, leaning up on our elbows. I kissed her, and she layed on her side as she used one hand to cup my face. I layed the same way, with my hands on her waist. There we were, making out in the grass, when Rosie walks up. \"Dylan, I fell and hurt my knee,\" Rosie cried. We immediatly pulled apart, and sat up. We stood up, and I picked up Rosie. \"It's okay, Rose, Lilly's got neospourn and a band-aid,\" I assured. Lilly put on the adhesive and the bandage. Rosie scurried away to go play with all the other kids. \"Now that that's taken care of, why don't we sit back down?\" Lilly asked, hopefully. \"Why don't we,\" I responed, sitting with my legs criss-crossed. She sat down in my lap, and threw her arms around my neck. Somehow, an hour later we ended up laying down. I was laying, and her head was on my chest, while her body was facing the opposite direction I was laying. We looked like a cross, without the one arm. I was twisting a lock of her hair from her pony tail. My other hand was intertwined with hers. Then my phone went off. I stopped twirling her hair, and answered it. It was my dad. \"Hi, Dad,\" I greeted. \"Hey, Dylan, it's 5, I'm on the way,\" he told. \"Okay, thanks, bye,\" I said. \"Bye,\" he replied. Then we hung up. \"What'd your dad want?\" Lilly asked, sitting up. \"He just told me he's on his way,\" I answered, standing up and helping Lilly up. \"Okay,\" she replied. We walked over to the play-ground to get Rosie. By the time we found her, my dad was here. We all got back in the car. That was mine and Lilly's day at the park.[Chapter 5] This chapter is dedicated to Penguinlover5527! Hope you enjoy! Lilly's POV It's 3 in the morning. I couldn't sleep so I decided to walk around the trails. I walked out of my room. I just had on a plain white t-shirt, grey sweat pants, and my hiking boots. I just walked around for some time. After a while a felt a pair of arms wrap around my waist. I got a kiss on the cheek, and I turned around. \"Hi, Dylan,\" I smiled, shyly. \"Hey, Lil, what are you doing out here at 3:30 am?\" he asked. \"I couldn't sleep, so I decided to go on a walk,\" I replied. \"Can I walk with you?\" Dylan questioned. \"Yeah,\" I answered. I took his hand and we walked. \"How'd you know I was out here?\" \"I couldn't sleep, so I was drawing. I saw something move past my window. I went out to see what it was, but it turned out to be you,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I nodded. It started pouring down rain a little while later. \"You want to keep walking?\" Dylan asked. \"Y-yeah,\" I chattered. \"Here,\" Dylan pulled me into his hoodie. He was wearing one of his mom's old hoodies. I forgot to grab a jacket before I left. \"T-thanks,\" I shivered. I warmed up. We decided to walk back to my house. We were stading on my front poorch a short time later. I was about to slip out of the hoodie, when Dylan lifted my chin to meat his gaze. He leaned down and kissed me. \"Goodnight, Beautiful,\" he whispered, after we pulled back. \"Goodnight,\" I blushed. I slid out of the hoodie, and went inside. I watched Dylan walk to his house. Within a few minutes, I was fast asleep. Sorry it's short! ","Summary":" Lilly's POV Dylan and I were laying on the roof with the jumbo flashlight.

The scientists breed a female Xenomorph hybrid , called Six , which escapes to join Sil , the alien antagonist of Species. However , Six and Sil are terminated . Patrick Ross and Joseph Kane have also been infected : Patrick is now a Species hybrid , while Joe is a Xenomorph hybrid . Meanwhile , clones of Sil and Six have been created ( Eve and Mary ) . Then , in order to terminate them all ( minus Eve and Mary) the scientists created another Xenomorph hybrid called the Rogue , which escapes as well . Now , Captain John Keller , his wife , Claire Becker , and their adopted Species daughter , Miranda Hollander , hope to find the 3 deadly beasts to stop the infection of the earth . Miranda was exhausted . She and her adopted parents were tired from journeying around the US looking for the \" Deadly Three \". Sure , they were evil . They were sexual overlords ( or overladies ). But couldn't they just take a few decades off and let Miranda enjoy her life ? Apparently not . However , they were going to some lab to find out why this all happened . Then there was that matter when she turned into a deadly alien and almost killed her parents . She could now control this power , although she had been haunted by dreams about this . What if I killed them ? she thought . But she didn't , so she didn't think about it . Her dad once said that her alien kind felt a need to do sexual activities . But Miranda didn't like sex . She thought it was disgusting to do that . Whatever thoughts she had were lost as her mom said \" We're here , sweetheart !'' The lab was huge . It was so freaking huge it took Miranda 55 seconds to process . It was huge and white . Scientist's scurried around . Miranda resisted the urge to take her bone dagger and stab someone . Being ADHD , Miranda hated peace . She liked chaos . One of the researchers rushed forward . \"Dr. Laura Baker '' She said . ''Miranda Hollander \" Miranda said . \" Now if you'll \" -Miranda saw the women .One had wavy blond hair and would be seductive to men . Sil's clone , she guessed . The other one had auburn hair and a normal appearance . But she seemed different . Her mom told her they were just like her . They were named Eve and Mary . The government was doing some kind of testing on them . Her dad talked to the generals. Then ,he told her \" So that's why you healed so fast when your arm got cut off . You healed !'' Miranda suddenly felt a jolt in her . \"Watch out ! \" she screamed . \" The Rogue is here !\" \"How is that possible –\" Suddenly the wall erupted . A gigantic blind lizard like thing crashed through the wall . It jumped on Miranda ,and all went dark .[Chapter 2] Xenomorphs Vs Species 2: Homesake Miranda seriously hated her life . Alright , she was the most popular kid in high school , but getting thrown by a giant mutant lizard ? That was just shit . Anyway , when she woke up , she was lying near the glass dome that housed the girls .The Rogue had done a lot of damage . She wasn't a professor or anything , but the Rogue had weakened the structure of the lab . Miranda caught sight of the women . They quickly pulled her in and locked the door . \" Who the heck are you people ?'' Miranda asked , bewildered . \" Get away from me ! \" The one with the blond hair said \" Relax , we're not going to fry you or anything . My name's Eve . And hers is Mary . \" \" Oh , you're the two freaks who turn into aliens every time they want to have intercourse ! \" I may be your species\" Miranda growled , \" But I'm not like you bitches ! \" Ok fine . They had a point . unless she wanted to be turned into alien pancake , she was gonna have to stay here . \" So , where's your home ?\" \" over there \" was Eve's reply . The home was pretty cool . There was a 90 –inch Blu-Ray TV over in the corner , an artist's easel which was full of red and gray paint ( and for some reason, something that looked like an artist's easel , but with bazookas, grenade launchers , rows of missile launchers , missile pods , Roman candles , high tech plasma weapons , sonic blasters , and dozens of high tech weapons .They were all wired and pointed at one direction . ) \" Where did you get that thing ? \" \"Eve built it in her dream . \" There were Nerf and paintball guns in the corner , along with pistols and assault rifles . \" Lets watch TV . '' Later , when everyone recovered , Eve and Mary stripped down to nothing( under armed guard ) and sat in chairs with blue straps covering their private parts .Miranda sat in her own chair ( with all clothes on) and suddenly , gas flooded in the room . Immediately , Eve and Mary started to scream , but Miranda held . Sissies , she thought . Then , she heard her dad's voice : \" Shut down that gas thing right now ! \" Eve and Mary were now screaming . Miranda just clenched with beads of sweat going down her face . When it was over , they were all covered with boils and burns . Her dad punched the scientist in the face . \" Wait Dad , here's the weird part …1…2…3… Suddenly the wounds started healing . Her dad looked terrified and approving at the same time , which Miranda called the \" Samsung – Morris \" look . Awesome .not a good sign . Whenever her dad did the Samsung -Morris look someone was gonna get hurt . \"Now , the egg from Six is believed to be a Queen Xenomorph . However , this Queen is different . It is sentient as a human and can communicate telepathically . So , we are sending a truce party to it and its mate the King . Beware the King , he is the Queen's top enforcer . Be warned : He will attempt to kill you . The Queen will be different , but this King is a normal one . Avoid at all costs . \" the fat general said . \" Ok , you three will lead a contingent of soldiers and the elite Black Guard . The Black Guard are here . \" 4 men clad in black with helmets covering their heads approach Miranda . They had orange circuitry on them here and there . Orange circles designated their helmets . they had sticks on the joints of their arms and legs . Breathing apparatuses snaked to their back . A pulsing disk glowed from their backs . \" It is time , \" one said . \" We are your elite strike team .\"[Chapter 3] Xenomorph Vs Species 3 : The Black Guard Note this is the first chapter I use a play like style of writing . New update will come tomorrow . Sorry about the Black Guard . They're really cool The Black Guard were pretty interesting . They were trained by a guy called Kim Do Nguyen for 20 years . They were elite ninja assassins with high-tech weapons such as rez-up katanas , batons that could generate light cycles and light jets , and batons that turned into double bladed lightsabers . They also had discs that had razor sharp edges and retractable pistols . In short , they were the ultimate ninja . Miranda took a liking to the Black Guard . They would follow orders without question . They wouldn't usually talk , but when they did , it was a deep voice . After she had learned their names ( Grid , Wolf , Shaddix , and Dyson ) , they got to the Xenomorph hive . It was in a subway , under the street . Eww . But the Black Guard got through . Miranda , Eve , and Mary were in the lead . The Guard held their various weapons . Grid held his plasma blaster and disc . Wolf held one of his sabers . Shaddix held his disc . Dyson held his katana for light . Suddenly there was hissing . A Xeno Drone attacked them ! It jumped on Wolf and tried to rip off his head . But Wolf slammed the Xeno into the wall , and drew his saber and executed the Xeno with it . They kept going . Dyson growled . Grid said \" Its getting dangerous- \"Suddenly , there was an ambush ! Grid and Wolf were pulled off . Shaddix stabbed a Xeno and kicked it into his brethren . Dyson sliced a Xeno in half , then stepped back to avoid the acid blood . Miranda grabbed her bone dagger and stabbed a Warrior Xenomorph . Eve tackled one , while Mary, who was the Xeno hybrid , was stalling the Xenos by immobilizing them with her psychic power over Xenos . Dyson yelled \" We have to destroy them ! \" he plucked a light grenade from his thigh and tossed it into the Xenomorph fray . \" Duck ! \" BOOM ! The hallway was a mess of Xeno parts . The remaining Black Guard had deployed their blast shields , while Miranda , Eve and Mary ducked behind a corner . Shaddix peeked from behind his shield . \" I think we should follow the pipe where the Xenomorphs took Grid and Wolf . Dyson agreed . Together , the five of them headed into the pipe .[Chapter 4] Xenomorph vs Species Chapter 4 The five of them crawled down the pipe . Miranda held her dagger , ready to stab any Xenomorph that came at them Dyson and Shaddix crawled behind her , with Eve and Mary in the back . Several hundred feet later , the pipe opened into a tunnel – a subway tunnel . Since there was no train , they walked down the rail . Soon , there was lots of webbing . The trail took them into the underground labyrinth of New York . They reached a small underground river . As they were walking . Miranda saw a crack in the brickwork , which led to a smaller room with a single wood door . Miranda and the team decided to jump in . The room was like a small cave . There were benches on the floor , with pictures of ravens , lions ,and spiders . A huge spider tumbled out of nowhere .It was huge! It tried to stab Dyson .But the Guard dodged it and ran towards the exit . \" this has to be the exit !\" yelled Shaddix .He kicked the door . Everyone leaned against the door . It broke . Miranda cursed the door for crumbling . \" AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH ! \" everyone yelled ,even Dyson . The Guards activated their light chutes , but Eve , Miranda , and Mary all tumbled to the floor . Suddenly , Miranda saw a light ! It was one of the missing Black Guard ! Wolf ! Wolf had an egg in front of him , but as soon as the other Guards came , he squashed it and dodged the acid . Wolf cut himself free . \" The Xenos took Grid down that way ! \" Wolf pointed at an arched doorway leading into darkness .\" Come on lets go \" said Wolf . The tunnel ran straight and smooth , but after their fall Miranda took no chances . She tapped the ground for traps and made sure the walls weren't unstable . The Guards helped by placing sonic scopes on the walls which checked for traps . Then they found the remains of a Xenomorph . Then they found Grid's baton .\" we're too late . \" Wolf said . \" No , not yet \" said Dyson . \" look , I hear sounds of commotion . Miranda heard deep throated voices and Xenomorph death hisses . They continued . Shaddix held his disc . There was moans and screeching , and silence . A THUMP ! broke the silence . When they turned the corner , they were amazed about what they saw .[Chapter 5] Xenomorph Vs Species 5 Chapter 5 : Discovery Miranda's rescue attempt stuttered to a halt . Sure , they expected dead Xenos . But this was different . Grid stood on a mountain of Xenomorph corpses , hurling back wave after wave of Xenomorphs . One came too close . The unlucky Xenomorph exploded , hurling its corpse down into its brethren . Grid was doing great . But soon ,Grid would die if they didn't do anything . Dyson made that easier by charging into the fray . He quickly defeated 3 Xenomorphs at the same time and caved in the Praetorian's crest . With a final kick , Dyson broke the Praetorian's neck with a Snap ! The corpse flew and landed on the wall over in the darkness . Dyson looked up at Grid . The Guard stared down and began to disembark . Finally , they reached the Hive . The Hive was like one vast cave full of webbing . 5 foot tall eggs littered the area . Xenomorphs scurried around, which directed , to the Queen. She was the huge masterpiece of the cave . Wolf took out his Stealth sniper But the Queen held them back-for now . Suddenly , the Queen hissed in their minds .Who are you ? the Queen asked . \" We're the Black Guar- \" I can tell , hissed the Queen . An elite group of soldiers who trained for 20 years under the influence of Kim Do Nguyen . About the same time I was born . \" Assassins , Your Majesty . \" Dyson replied in clipped sentences . WHO ARE YOU ? asked the King . The gigantic Xenomorph loomed over his mate . FRESH BLOOD . No , mate the Queen said . \" Uh , Your Majesty – you may speak in your mind . I know your purpose .\" To ask for peace \". You and your underlings may not know this , Miranda Hollander , but your superiors will experiment and destroy us . We have been through this before . I was a lab experiment until Kurai Blackwood set us free , along with 2 other Xenomorphs called Makoto and Shisome . They both live on the planet Pluvia . Alas , we were doomed to crash on your racist planet . Earth . Shisome was my sister , and she is a Queen . I wish I was on a planet like Pluvia ….. But no . Fate sent us here , to your racist planet . \" Uh , Your Majesty , where is this ? An unexplored and uncharted system of caverns under your city . That is why you would have to descend into New York's buried city to unearth us . In short , I think a labyrinth was built around these caverns . Thank you for finding us . Can you please tell us the way out . \" Uh , you go out of here into an arched doorway , which leads to the Chamber Of Spiders , once you exit , you follow a river to a system of pipes , take the one with FUCK spray painted on it , then take the tunnel to the subway , then head up a circular door , which has a passage to this Roman room , then go up to find a storage room , up then your out of here . Thank you . As for the truce , no . However , I will give it some thought , and since you have been nice , a quick death will do . Dyson gulped . \" Run ! \" the Black Guard yelled . He joined his companions and they rushed off into darkness .[Chapter 6] Xenomorphs Vs Species Chapter 6 : Escape And Evasion Miranda and her friends darted into the dark tunnels of New York's labyrinth . Behind them , Warrior Xenomorphs followed them as they raced through the tunnels . Everyone ran at their limits . Miranda was soon out of breath , but the Xenos made her go even faster . She leapt over a pipe . Soon , the tunnel shortened , so they had to crawl at a fast rate . The Warriors could fit into the pipes , so they had to stop at times . However , the Praetorians were too big to fit , so that gave Miranda comfort . The Guards were behind her , Eve in front , Mary in back . After a while , the Xenos fell back . However , the Guards and her ran until they were sure that the Xenos were gone . Dyson looked back \" Finally they're gone \" he replied drastically . \" You don't hafta be dramatic \" Shaddix said . Finally , they reached a heavy metal door . They opened it , and there was a basement . \" Where are we ? \" Eve asked . \" According to my onboard computer , we are in the lower basement area of the new 1 WTC complex , commander . \" Grid reported . \" Then let's get to the upper basement , people . \" Dyson suggested . It was an order ,not a suggestion . The Guard headed up . They faced an underground parking lot . \" Yeah it's the new WTC .\" Miranda retorted . \" Permission to override , Commander Dyson ? \" Permission granted \" Dyson replied . The Guard and Miranda 's friends ( including herself ) walked out of the WTC .[Chapter 7] Xenomorph Vs Species Chapter 7 : BEST DATE EVER ! Dyson After the Xeno hive thingy had occurred , Dyson and Miranda went on a date . Miranda suggested Mr . Smoothie , but Dyson said \" The All You Can Eat Supreme Buffet \" They went with the buffet . They paid their bills , then sat to eat . \" How are you gonna eat with a big helmet ? \" Dyson sighed , and unmasked . Dyson's face was shaped like an arrow head . He had narrow eyes , a good haircut , and a minuscule beard .Like its master , it was shaped like an arrowhead . His voice was a little high , but with an air of command . \" Yeah , you're right . \" Dyson ordered a triple T-bone steak and scrambled eggs . Miranda ordered a huge steaming pile of roast pork . Both ate ravenously . Miranda finished hers in a minute . Dyson finished 20 seconds early . \" I eat faster ! \" Dyson ordered pork ribs and brisket sandwiches . Miranda ordered pizza and a bowl of steaming chicken soup . Both ate again . \" Man this is tasty \" Dyson said while devouring a brisket sandwich . \" Best briskets I ever tasted ! \" Dyson and Miranda were soon done . \" You still hungry ? \" \"Yep . \" Miranda ordered a quarter –pound double cheeseburger . \" Dyson , you can't eat this much and still be hungry ! \" Yeah I can ,the Guard replied . he had a few pounds left in his stomach . \" You eat , cause I'm going to order a Pepsi .\" Alright . \" \" hey , on a date , aren't we supposed to kiss and get gooey ? \" No , just talk and eat . \" Miranda What did Dyson mean by \" talk and eat ? \" As she went to order her Pepsi , she saw something . It looked like a Xeno ,but when she looked at it again , it was gone . Oh well . She was gonna have to worry about it some other time . Xenomorphaddicted2 here . well , that's pretty much it .

A/N: Okay, so here is my NEW and IMPROVED fanfic for DylanxLily. I should be updating about once a week from here on out. Don't know how long it'll go, but we'll see!Please keep in mind that the movie is now closed and I am relying on the WBAZ Wikipedia article to remember everything about the movie. Yeah. SO: here it is! Oh, yeah, and: REVIEW! DYLAN POV: Here I was: thinking about Lily again. Our first kiss had been pretty awesome. I was hoping we would kiss again, but for some reason, I didn't feel brave enough. It was like the first kiss was so cliché that it was inevitable and easy, but all the ones after it seemed forced. My thoughts were interrupted, of course, by the girl in question walking by and smiling at me. \"Hey.\" She said, grabbing my hand and swinging it as she danced around. \"What are you all happy about?\" I asked, looking into her eyes. \"School starting next week. I'm so sick of homeschooling.\" She said excitedly. \"Well don't get too excited until to get there and see what public school's like for yourself.\" I said, \"Kids can be pretty mean, believe me.\" \"Lily!\" Kelly yelled form inside the barn, \"Come help with the monkey feed!\" \"Coming!\" Lily yelled. She stopped and looked straight at me. \"Oh Dylan, I'm not scared about school. I'm happy. You'll be with me, how could I be scared?\" she said, and just easy as that, she kissed me before running off to help Kelly. Still in awe at how easy she had made that, I looked around and noticed a figure under the barn roof. \"Dad! You were spying?\" I said, embarrassed. \"Aww, but it's so sweet!\" Dad said. Still, I couldn't believe he'd been spying on Lily and I. I mean, some things were to be kept private, you know? \"Okay, I'll stop: promise.\" He said. \"Now come on, I want to take a walk with you.\" \"Ummm, okay.\" We walked off towards the lion cage before he stopped, and said \"You know…I've been thinking about you and Lily lately.\" I was just about to answer him when far off, I heard a girl scream. A/N: OOOOOOHHHH! Cliff hanger! Sorry, I just had to. See you in a week. REVIEW![Chapter 2] A/N: Sorry about the cliff-hanger guys! So, I wrote my story First Kiss and some reviewers said it was too short (and it was), so I really tried to make this one longer, but the way it looks in Word is VERY different form the page. The page on FF makes it seem a lot shorter, so I'm really gonna try and make this chapter longer. K? Good Review please! I have anonymous reviews turned on, so even if you don't have an account, you can still review. She'd only been lifting up a bag of monkey feed when it happened. Kelly had left her alone in the barn to run a trip to the grocery store. How was she to know that that particular bag was holding up the broken shelf? That removing that bag would send around 50 25lb bags of feed tumbling down onto her? All she could do was scream before the last bag fell, knocking the wind out of her, and smashing onto her head. DYLAN POV: I knew that scream. Even 200 yards away, I knew it. It was a sound that could only come from Lily. \"Lily?\" It was coming from the barn. I ran, tripping, and yelling. When we reached the barn, it was all I could do not to pass out. She lay under a giant pile of feed bags, an enormous metal shelf, and she was hurt. Her eyes were up, her head tuning to look at me, tears streaming down her face. \"D…Dylan.\" She choked out. \"The bags…they fell. Hey, where's your dad?\" I looked back. \"I think he went to call an ambulance for you.\" I said as I reached out to grasp her hand firmly. I kissed her once, lightly, and stood up. Using all the effort I could muster, and strength I didn't know I had, I lifted the shelf off of her and threw it aside. One by one, I lifted the feed bags until only a few remained and the EMTs had arrived. A nurse walked out of room 45B, and said \"the Lily party?\" Startled by the amount of people that stood up, including but not limited to ever person that lived on or was employed at our zoo, she quickly said, \"Only immediate family at this time please.\" Dad and I quickly walked in, Kelly still frantically driving back from the grocery store, and saw her lying there, awake and smiling. \"Dylan! Mr. Mee!\" she exclaimed. \"How you feelin' Lil'?\" Dad asked carefully. \"Good, actually. They said I only had a bruised rib cage. I should be fine in about 2 days or so.\" Dad's phone rang. \"Hello…..Kelly!...yes, we're in 45B….No, the other building….okay, I'll be there in a second…\" \"I'm going to go help Kelly find her way here. You two catch up for a minute.\" He said, running out. I walked over the bed and sat down. \"I guess you'll be missing the first day of school?\" I asked gently. \"Yeah.\" She said, looking sad. \"You know, you shouldn't ditch, Lily. That's not good for your education .\" I said teasingly. \"Shut up!\" she said, giggling. She leaned up to thwack me on the head, but I stopped her arm and kissed her. \"Ahem.\" A voice from the doorway said. I turned around and saw Kelly. Crap . \"Um, I'll just go. \" I said, backing out of the room. \"Yes, you will.\" Kelly said, turning around to give me a fake glare. Behind Kelly's back, Lily winked at me. My brain went mushy. I didn't realize I had a goofy grin plastered on my face until I heard Lily giggling and felt Kelly give me a good-natured shove out of the room. \"Come on, Dylan. We have to get you to bed on time for school tomorrow.\" Dad said, putting his arm on my shoulder. A/N: Thanks for reading! Review! I tried to make it longer this time. I may not be able to update that often. I had auditions for high school all last week and I didn't have any time to write. They should be less time than this update though. Let me know what you want to see I need suggestions, I don't have anything planned except for a few details I HAVE to work in, and so all suggestions are welcome and will probably be honored. ' Til next time, Hpgirl1564[Chapter 3] A/N: Sorry it's been so long! I didn't think anyone was reading this because I didn't get views or reviews for the longest time. I guess it's because the DVD came out this week. Here you go! It's the first day of 8 th grade . Dylan POV I looked up to the door of the school building. Lily still didn't understand. School was NOT fun. Here she was blabbing to the group of girls inside the door. You know, THOSE girls. The ones who made your life miserable if you got on their bad side. I had to get her away from them. \"Okay, heh heh, we should go to your homeroom now….\" I said, trying to nonchalantly give her the message that these were not friendly creatures. The main one, whats her face, looked at me. \"Oohhh! Hi Dylan!\" she said loudly. \"How was your summer! I heard your family bought SeaWorld!\" I sat down on a bench outside the door. \"No. We bought a zoo, stupid.\" \"Oh! That sounds so cool!\" she said, creepily sliding up to me on the bench. The rest of the pack took their cues from her and sat down to ask stupid questions. Lily was fuming. \"Umm, gotta go! It's my girlfriend's I first day and I gotta show her around!\" I said, quickly getting up before the smell of cheap perfume could overwhelm me. I took Lily's hand as the gossiping started and we ran down the hall, making it to our homeroom just as the bell rang. \"Thank you for arriving Mr. Mee. Who's with you?\" the teacher asked. Great. She already looked at me like a troublemaker. \"Um, this is my friend…\"Crap, Lily was giving me a glare.. \"Her name is Lily. She was homeschooled until now.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" she said after she got her packet and sat down next to me. \"Are you keeping this a secret or something?\" she said, looking hurt. \"Oh, no no no. It's just that you don't really….tell teachers about these things. Trust me.\" Yeah. You DO NOT tell teachers. \"What do you mean?\" Lily said. \"It's just that..\" \"Mr. Mee! Would you care to share something with the class?\" the teacher screamed. Another evil glare. This was gonna be a long year.[Chapter 4] A/N: Hey guys, so I didn't honestly think anyone was reading this, so THANK YOU for reviews. Honestly, that's what you really have to do to get updates. If an author thinks nobody is reading, they won't update BUT, I'm in a play, and our show is 2 weeks away, so I'll have rehearsals like everyday until 8pm and I'll barely have enough time to do my HW, so this might be the last update for a while. SORRY! I hope you guys understand. Now to the chapter. It's LUNCHTIME! DYLAN POV Well, we made it through homeroom, and 2nd period. Now we had lunch. This I was afraid of. We walked hand in hand to towards the cafeteria and walked through the double-doors. Lily looked over at me. \"What should I get for lunch? I've never bought lunch from a cafeteria before! What should I get?\" she said eagerly. I laughed. \"Lily, you find the item that looks the most like food. Make sure it's also the item that has the smallest grease puddle on it, then buy it and choke it down. Got it?\" I said. We got in line, grabbed a tray each, and moved down to the fridge thingy to get milk. \"Oh.\" She said, her eagerness subdued by the dismal looking \"food\" array offered. \"How's this?\" She set her sights on a taco. I had to warn her. \"No, Lil. Ever heard of 'pink slime'? Just get the salad. That should be decent.\" \"Okay.\" We both picked up \"salads\" and paid, Lily thumbing through her ratty pink Vera Bradley wallet. Turning around to re-enter the lunchroom, we realized another problem. We had nowhere to sit. There wasn't even an empty table where we could go and talk. We walked awkwardly through the cafeteria trying to find nice looking people. \"DYLAN!\" a high annoying voice said. \"Dylan, I think that girl knows you. Is that somewhere we could sit?\" lily said, clueless. I looked over. Of course, it was that girl from this morning. Hannah Leinz. \"No!\" I said, a little too forcefully. Seeing the hurt look on Lily's face, I quickly backpedaled. \"Those are not the people we want to associate ourselves with. Trust me.\" Out the corner of my eye, I saw that in the time it had taken to tell Lily this, Hannah had been walking towards us. \"Dylan! You should come sit with us. I saved a seat for my boyfriend, but we broke up this morning after I talked to you, so you can sit there! Oh, and you can come too, whatever.\" She finished, looking at Lily with a glare. \"Umm\" I said, stalling for time. I really didn't want to sit there, but you just don't refuse the popular girl. \"Sure. We can sit with you.\" Lily said. \"That's too bad you broke up with your boyfriend. Me and Dylan have been together for 3 months now. How long had you guys been together?\" I loved her even more in that single moment. We made our way across the lunchtable, and all the girls(al with about 6 pounds of makeup on I must add) quickly scooted over to let me sit. \"Oh, you know, since Julianna's pool party.\" Hannah answered Lily, as if that explained a time frame whatsoever. I sat down, then looked around to see if Lily had anywhere to sit. The 2 girls on either side of me awkwardly scooted towards me until our thighs were touching. Awkward. \"Umm\" I jumped up. \"We need somewhere for Lil' to sit.\" I said. \"Why?\" Hannah asked. \"Yeah, we don't even know her, so who cares?\" the other one (Julianna?) said. \"And she's dressed funny.\" The girl next to Hannah added. I looked up to Lily's face. Her eyes were filled with tears and her bottom lip was quivering. \"Ummm we're just gonna go and eat in the library.\" I said quickly. \"Okay…text me!\" Hannah yelled after us as I took Lily's hand and, for the second time today, ended up sprinting down the hallway. \"In here.\" I said, pointing to the never-used janitor's closet I hid in to draw all last year. She nodded, too upset to talk. I guided her to the always upturned bucket that was in the corner, sat down and pulled her into my lap. She immediately began to cry. \"They're…They're so m-mean!\" she said through her tears. \"I know. I'm so sorry.\" I said, pulling her into a hug and pushing her hair out of the way of the dirty mop overhead. \"Am I really d-dressed funny?\" she said, starting another round of sobbing. \"No. You are the most gorgeous girl I've ever known in my life. And I love you Lily Miska. You don't listen to them.\" \"Okay.\" She said, smiling now.. \"I love you too.\" I looked deep into her eyes, pulling her face to mine for a sweet kiss.

HPGIRL1564[Chapter 6] A/N: Hey guys! Massive MASSIVE thanks to an anon reviewer named \"story ideas\" that basically gave me the plotline for this chapter! Most credit goes to her I'm just writing it out! And in case you haven't noticed, we can make story covers now! What do you think of mine? I make all of them myself haha Onto the chapter(which for a change will be in 3 rd person now ) Dylan and Lily finished their lunches in the janitor's closet, Dylan joking and finally tickling Lily just to get her to cheer up. After the bell rang, Dylan opened the door slyly and checked the hallway before jokingly pretending to pull out a walkie-talkie and say \"All clear for preceding to 3rd period!\", which of course earned him a good natured punch and \"Come on, you goof!\" from Lily. Alter successfully avoiding Hannah for most of the day (besides one awkward run-in during 5th that was quickly avoided), Dylan and Lily made their way to the front of the school to collect their books from Lily's locker. She tried to pick up her math book and her English folder, but her Science folder slipped out of the heavy textbook and slipped to the ground. Picking up the folder, she noticed a trampled flyer on the ground. \" REMEMBER THIS\" DANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NEEDED, see room 269 OCTOBER 18 th 7pm \"We should do it! It'd be fun to do the decorations and stuff!\" Lily said, stuffing the paper in her backpack and closing her locker. \"I don't know Lil'. It seems pretty girly to me.\" Dylan replied as they walked out the front door to wait for Kelly. \"It won't be. It'll be fun.\" Lily said, and then waved to the Rosewood Animal Park truck driving towards them. \"Okay, fine. I guess it won't be that bad.\" Dylan replied, still wary. As the days passed, Lily and Dylan found that working on the dance was something both of them liked very much. For Dylan it came naturally, and he designed both the dance's logo and poster. Lily found that organizing the dance and all of its 7 committee members was helping her break out of her shell and forget about Hannah and her clique. 2 days before the big night, after the final touches had been put on the preparations, Kelly was driving the two home when Dylan said to Kelly \"Can we pull in over by the house? There's something I want Lily to see.\" Lily looked out the truck window. \"Dylan, it's dark outside, silly!\" Driving past the house, Lily looked up in awe as Lite-Brites scrounged from the Zoo's attic spelled out \"L-I-L-Y-,-D-A-N-C-E W-I-T-H M-E-?\" on the roof where the two liked to lay. Kelly rolled the truck to a stop, then hopped out saying \"'l leave you two alone for a bit.\" Lily and Dylan jumped out. Dylan looked hopefully at Lily. \"So, what do you say?\" Lily smiled sheepishly. \"I'd love to go with you Dylan.\" she said before throwing her arms around his neck and giving him a big hug. Dylan hugged her back, and smiled at the stars behind her. The night of the big dance, Lily threw on her dress (dark blue with ruching in the front) and a tad bit of makeup. She did her blonde hair into an up-do and put in her ears some crystal earrings. She walked downstairs and Kelly turned around to meet her. \"Oh, Lily! You look so pretty! So grown up!\" Kelly said, giving her a big hug. \"Thanks, Kelly.\" Lily said, blushing. Lily grabbed her shrug and sat down to wait for Dylan. (A/N: From this point on, things might deviate a little from the movie. Keep in mind this storyline wasn't fully developed in the movie and I honestly can't remember why lily is living with Kelly. SO, I'll just have to make it up from here, k?) \"Lil'?\" Kelly asked timidly, sitting down next to Lily. \"Yeah?\" she replied. \"I'm surprised you're wearing your mom's earrings. I thought you didn't like wearing them.\" Kelly said carefully. \"Well, I guess I thought I'd like to have a piece of Mom with me tonight.\" Lily replied. \"Right.\" Kelly said. As Kelly was getting up to go back to the dishes, there was a knock at the door. Lily opened it to find Dylan, waiting for her in a suit, although looking a bit uncomfortable. As they danced, Dylan didn't let go of Lily's hand all night. He got up the nerve to kiss her a couple times, but they were having a nice night, safely avoiding Hannah's desperate searches for him. Song after song came on, and they had a great time. However, the DJ started the next song, and Lily stepped away. \"What's wrong?\" Dylan asked, confused. He looked closer to find tears streaming down her face. \"Um…it's okay. It's just that this was the song my Mom and I used to dance around the kitchen to before the accident.\" Lily choked out. \"Oh…well, we don't have to dance to it if you don't want to. I'm going to go to the bathroom okay?\" Dylan replied, unsure how to answer. The second Dylan left, Lily turned around and pulled out a tissue, dabbing her eyes, and went to get some punch. Walking towards the streamer-clad table, she realized Hannah and her friends were gathered around it, whispering. All were clad in tight tube dresses and higher heels than any girl in the dance. Lily quickly went to turn away, to go back to where Dylan would expect her to be waiting, but as Lily was turning around, Hannah suddenly leaned out of the circle and saw Lily. \"Crap.\" Lily said under her breath as Hannah made her way towards her. \"Hey Lily! Where's Dylan?\" Hannah said, grabbing Lily's arm and pulling her towards the punch table. \"Um, in the bathroom.\" Lily replied. \"I actually should probably um go wait for him.\" Lily said. \"Would you like some punch first?\" Hannah asked, a bit too nicely. \"Um, yeah, but…\" The next few seconds happened in slow motion. As Lily turned around, trying to complete her sentence and say \"I should go find Dylan\", trying to walk away, Hannah and 2 of her friends lifted the large glass punch bowl and proceeded to pour the dark pink punch all over Lily. After the punch had been drained, lily stood there gaping as students crowded around her. Hannah's clique, in a rush to get out of the situation, knocked over Lily, leaving her lying on the floor. A student's foot accidentally kicked her head, and lily felt dizzy. The last thing she remembered was a thin shoe heel brutally crushing a delicate crystal earring on the floor in front of her face.

So, how are we supposed to get across?\" \"Jump!\" \"Jump?nCool.\" and with that, Deliyah walked over to the edge and jumpednonto the rock, being as steady as possible. Sean followed behindncautiously. \"You'llnbe fine, Deliyah! Just keep your eyes on the rocks and don't lookndown!\" Sean yelled out, gripping on for safety. Deliyah laughed. Thisnwas the first time she had laughed in what felt like years, yet itnhad only been days. Very long, painful days. When Deliyah had gottennto the other side, Sean still had to get across a few rocks. When henlooked safe, the rock started to tilt. \"Sean!nLean forward!\" \"I'mntilting!\" He yelled. \"AAAH!\"nYelled Sean, holding on for dear life. Hisneyes were still shut; little did he know the rock was upright again. \"Deliyah,nI know I just met you, but if I die, know that I love you!\" henyelled. \"Opennyour eyes!\" she laughed. He opened his eyes widely and let out ansigh of relief. Henjumped off the rock quickly, landing on the stable ground. \"Hah,nthat was fun!\" Said Sean, the adrenalin still rushing through him. \"So,nyou love me now?\" said Deliyah, teasing Sean. \"Hey,nit was scary!\" he said in his defense. They both laughed.

Summary: what if sean was in worse shape than what he was after crash landing via kite on the island? Chapter one: The last thing he could recall was Trevor calling his name as he was wrenched of the raft . \"sean!\" he called bordering on the edge of hysteria as he was buffeted by the force of the wind. He remembered willing himself to hold on for as long as possible to the kite, then yelling in pain as the rope violently ripped the skin off his fingers as it slid through his hands and then dropping like a stone onto something that was hard. Then, the blackness claimed him. The first thing he registered was pain. and something gritty in his mouth. . Quick check he thought. The stuff in his mouth was sand. Sand? What was sand doing in his mouth? Then the events of last night came back to him in a disjointed flash – trying to stop the sail from getting away – being wrenched off the raft – trevor's terrified yells – slipping and then hitting something that was hard. He shook himself out of his reverie as the events of last night and the new situation that he was in sunk in. Trying not to panic, he thought right, quick check. He rolled over onto his back and tried to sit up without much success. He lay back down gasping. He lay there for a few minutes letting himself calm down, breathing in time to the waves that were gently breaking along the shoreline. He gingerly tied to sit up again, taking it easy and managed to get himself into a semi - sitting position. He loooked around him. The place seemed deserted and very, very quiet. That was when he noticed a dull ache that was settled , well, pretty much everwhere. He moved his hands slowly through the warm golden sand trying to calm himself. He groaned involuntarily as he looked down at himself. 'shit' he thought to himself. He really did a number on himself this time. There was a huge gash on his left arm and his left wrist seemed to be broken looking at the swelling – as well as large cuts on the interior joints of his fingers on both hands where the rope had skinned them. As he looked down at his torso, panic started to bubble back up to the surface, but he forced it back down. His ribs war quite amazing – a colourful display of blacks, greens and yellow, he figured he must have hit a couple of trees during his descent. He could feel scabs cracking on his back as he twisted, and a few trickles of blood escaping their confines and running down his back. His right kneecap was swollen and shiny, and the skin felt very tight. the bruising had yet to make an appearence, judging by the way he could still sort of move it it was only a fracture or a light break – nothing to serious, he hoped he could put weight on it , he gently tested it adding pressure to see how much it would take. His left leg seemed to be the only part of him that was relatively unscathed. His face for the most part seemed to be okay as well, apart from the large cut on his head and the bruise that dominated along his jawline. He looked around, noticing his surroundings for the first time. A few splinters of the raft had washed ashore. It took a moment for him to process this information, and then it dawned on him. Wait, if splinters of the raft was here then the rest of the raft must have come this direction as well and that meant – 'yes!' trevor and hannah must be here somewhere as well, and they can't be too far away. He gently eased himself up with his good arm and rolled over onto his left knee, making sure that he didn't knock any of his injuries and pushed himself up onto his remaining leg and gingerly tried to put some weight onto his steadily swelling kneecap. He lowered his calf and got about halfway when he yelped with pain, the joint hurt like hell dammit – he should've figured that it would hurt to bend his leg. He looked around. There was a few branches, a couple of planks of wood and the shredded remains of the kite which fortunately included the ropes that had been used to secure it. With any luck he should be able to at least secure his injuries and use some branches to make a crutch. 'right, i'll have to shred the kite to make some wrappings, using... wait what could he use? And then, thank god, he remembered his pocket knife. He took out his knife and hopped over to where the remnants of the sail lay and started methodically cutting it into strips. He bound his knee, rolled his trouser leg down over the wrapped injury and found a length of wood that he snapped to match the length of his leg. He then proceded to tie his leg to it, wincing whenever he shifted his injury. Finally his leg was secure. He then proceded to do the same to his wrist, binding the gash on his arm at the same time . he had tried to wash the gash, but one drop of saltwater stinging it was enough to put him off the notion and just hope for the best. He then wrapped his back as best he could without being able to see what he was doing and wiped at the cut on his head with some dry cloth, noticing that some kind of goo seemed to be coming out of it. Yuck! He said. this is even more gross than the time when the toilet blocked back at is mom's house. Poor mom he thought to himself, if only she could see me now – in fact he was kind of glad she didn't because he didn't want to give her a heart attack – he figured he must look pretty rough. Then, a disturbing thought came to him. How was he gonna impress hannah now? He must \"look a right sight\", as his grandpa used to say. He brushed that thought away as he started to lift what scant supplies he now had and threw them all into his back pack. Gingerly putting it on over his crudely bandaged back, he hefted it and lifted some more lengths of wood, snapped them roughly and adorned the tops of them with some balls of rolled up cloth, so as to stop them chafing his palms as he leant on them all day, would stop splinters as well. He did an experimental hop with them. They seemed okay. He had spare cloth in his backpack just in case. He had an experimental drink of some water that was lying in a pool nearby and spat it out disgustedly, realizing that it was seawater. Ugh. He concentrated on getting the salty taste out of his mouth as he walked, limped and hopped for the next hundred yards or so. He gave up, realizing that the only thing that was gonna take the taste out his mouth was food or a drink of non – salty water. That was when he heard a little chirping sound at his ear. He whipped his head round quickly and saw one of the little glow- in – the – dark birds that he had seen earlier in the cave. The bird flew around his head once almost as if it wee beckoning to him, and he shrugged, and thought well it's not like I have anything to lose. He followed the bird and as he neared a protruding rock , he delightedly realized that there was normal water that he could drink trickling off it. He cupped his hands and took several large gulps before turning around to say thanks to the birdie, as he liked to call it. He then said – hey can you take me to trevor? The bird for the most part, seemed to understand him and turned to head in the direction that they'd just come from and he followed it, painstakingly slowly, he followed it as best he could with his injuries starting to throb, as it was brought to the forefront of his mind again, in the absence of focusing on needing a drink. He hopped along losing concentration as the temperature steadily climbed. His vision started to get foggy and that was when he saw the blurry outlines of people in the distance. \"hey!\" he shouted, striding foward with renewed vigor. He only vaguely registered tripping and falling to the ground when an explosion of pain hit him and, for the second time since last slipping from the sail that previous night, he blacked out.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2. trevor's pov. Last night was a blur if he was being honest to himself. One minute they were fighting for the denomination of the raft against the freaky fish and the next minute he saw sean being violently ripped off the boat as he valiantly tried to keep the sail in check. He made a lunge for the poor kid and missed, nearly slipping into the choppy waters around them in the process, it was only then after he had hurriedly scrambled to his feet that he realized that sean was already a good 20 foot in the air, with no hope of being reached. \"sean!\" he called desperately crying at the same time as he realized there was no chance. He was as good as dead. he remembered hazily through his dispair of hannah trying to comfort him to tell him that everything would be okay and that he was a smart kid, but it didn't really do anything to ease the pain of seeing him terrified and the thought of what his mom would go through when they told her the news. He wept, feeling completely useless, when suddenly, a huge wave erupted out of nowhere tossing and turning them until he passed out. He awoke the next day to the sound of waves and birds chirping. Sunlight cracked through his eyelids as he made for a glimpse of his surroundings before freaking out. There wasn't exactly any theories on how to end up on a remote island with little chance of survival and the loss of one close to you in his textbooks at home or in any of his lab training. He tried to get himself motivated into getting up and making the best of a bad situation by saying that maybe sean crashed on the same island and they would be able to get off the island someway. Help would come, he tried to reassure himself. He heaved himself up, mustering a great sigh as he did so. Hannah was stretched out none too far away from him and he hobbled on stiff legs as he approached her. He gently shook her looking for signs of life. Her pulse was strong and her breathing was regular so she should be waking up by now. Whilst he was waiting he decided to go around and see if there was anything worth salvaging. There was. He found his rucksack with it's contents scattered everywhere in the vicinity. some water casks, some old maps that could possibly be salvaged if dried out, his compass and his thermometer. He put them all in a pile along with some other things belonging to hannah. Just as he was doing that, she began to stir, and he rushed over to her to make sure that she was okay and that no damage was done. \"Hannah?\" He enquired gently. \"Trevor?\" she said. \"Yeah i'm right here.\" \"where the hell are we?\" \"ummm, not so sure about that right now but hopefully we shall find out in the not so distant future\" \"kay.\" She clambered to her feet, giving an involuntary groan as she did so, and was imediately questioned about her well being. \"are you alright?\" Trevor asked. \"yeah, just a little stiff that's all\". \"okay then, let's go!\" They had wandereed for a little while under the shade of a few scant trees dotted along the cove that they were in, when they heard a bewildered shout. \"hey!\" It was definitely male, propbally just a boy. \"sean?\" He seemed to be trying to limp along on two crude crutches. Trevor could have wept with relief when he realized that it was indeed his nephew. He started to sprint towards him and noticed how sean's pace became a little quicker when suddenly the boy tripped on a tree root and practically face planted into the sand, giving a yell of pain as he did so. Trevor expected him to try and get up, but started to get worried when he realized that he wasn't moving. Please be okay, he half prayed as he raced towards sean's prone form. When he neared, to where he lay, he gasped at what he saw. Huge lacertations covered the boy's back,and some of his limbs were crudely bound, although under what must have been trying circumstances for the poor boy, he couldn't help but admire the work that he had done. Trevor quickly applied two fingers to sean's neck and breathed a sigh of relief when he realized that there was a fairly strong pulse. The boy was a fighter that was for sure. He called to hannah to come help him and in no time they were able to get him further into the forest, under the cover of the leaves and into the coolness of the shade. Just as Trevor made to roll up the hem of sean's shirt, his eyelids started to flutter open. Sean pov. I was brought back to awareness with a jolt. As i opened my eyes. Some guys head swam into veiw. To be quite honest i wasn't really responsible for what happened next. I mean when you wake up, to a different place to where you passed out in to find some dude leaning over you, well i freaked okay. It was a perfectly normal reaction. I started yelling incoherently with some swearing thrown into the mix and then tried to hit the unknown guy. Big mistake. I tried to hit him with my bad arm and a fresh wave of the most excrucuiating pain erupted through me like i was being burned. I yelled in pain, and the guy started to try and calm me down. And that was when i realized something. It was a familiar voice, one that sounded like – \"trevor?\" \"yep i'm right here buddy.\" \"good. I was worried for a bit about being stuck here by myself.\" \"naww...i would never give up on you. It's either look for you or go and tell your mom the news. either one sounds awful, but i wouldn't be able to live with myself id i thought you were dead or something. After all it's my fault that we are here in the first place.\" \"don't beat yourself over it. We're all here together safe and sound and that's all that matters.\" \"well, i don't know about that. I mean look at the state of you. What happened?\" \"i don't know how to break this to you trev, but crash landing in the middle of a storm on a strange island with a makeshift sail ain't exactly the safest thing in the world. You should be glad that the injuries arn't more extensive!\" \"more extensive?\" echoed trevor. \"how could they be more extensive?\" \"well i could be dead\" said sean. \"you still could be if we don't get you sorted - and fast.\" \"what do you mean?\" \"what I mean is, some of these cuts may be infected, and that amount of infection could penetrate your immune system, making you too weak to continue fighting it, which could mean that it would slowly kill you.\" \"aww crap – look, just do whatever – but I wanna die at home – not on some crappy island!\" \"I don't think you're gonna die, but let's try to not take any unnecessary risks.\" \"kay\". …... Trevor said \" right now we need to get some supplies so that we can cleanse the wounds and wrap them again.\" \"well I've got some sheets in my rucksack if you need them!\" \"great! That will do just perfectly!\" replied Trevor in a tense voice. He was starting to get quite worried. He really wanted to get these cuts sorted – once they were done properly the pain that they were surely causing the poor boy would begin to subside. He rooted around in Sean's somewhat bedraggled backpack for a while until he finally found what he was looking for – the tightly bundled package consisting of some strips of cloth and Sean's penknife. He pulled it out of the bag and got to work. He decided that it would be best to work from the top down. \"Hannah?\" \"yeah?\" \"could you fetch me some water?\" \"Yeah sure- can you pass me one of the casks?\" Trevor passed it to her. Minutes later, she returned, careful not to spill any, she gently lowered it to the forest floor beside where Sean lay. Trevor carefully unwrapped the makeshift bandage on Sean's head and winced at what he saw. The cut itself wasn't so bad – it was the swelling around it that got him worried. He hoped it was only minor, obviously the boy would have concussion but he hoped that that was all it was. He carefully dabbed at it with a bit of cloth that had been saturated with sea water, and a sharp intake of breath was audible as the salt in the water stung the wound. \"I'm sorry but it's the best way, as the wound needs to be cleaned and the salt will help with killing all the germs – it'll help it heal faster as well.\" Sean nodded silently, gritting his teeth and squeezing his eyes shut. After it was cleansed, they carefully applied some gauze that they had been able to salvage from the mini first aid kit that Hannah had thought to pack before they had left and smoothed it over the broken skin. They undid the rest of the wrappings and repeated the process for his torso arms, hands and leg. Once Sean was relatively cleaned up and medicalised (AN: Is that even a word? :S), dusk was just beginning to settle, and they decided that they might as well try and set up some form of camp for the night – food would become a priority in the morning.[Chapter 3] Crash landings tend to hurt: chapter 3 A/N sorry it's been a while since I last updated. I see a few of you have favorited and followed this story so far so thank you very much for the support. Suggestions for this story are welcome, as are reveiws. So here you are: chapter 3. Trevor cracked his eyes open. Sunlight streamed through the trees above them, and the faint hum of insects was easily audible in the eerie silence throughout the forest. He heaved a sigh, and almost wanted to go back to sleep, as he just couldn't get motivated to get up and do anything, as he felt it would be fruitless against the situation. Then he remembered Sean. He scrambled up on all fours, tousling the loose soil under his fingers as he did so, and crawled over to where Sean lay. He looked down at him and what he saw confirmed his suspicions from last night, he was starting to show the symptoms of an oncoming infection, so to try and fend it off for as long as possible meant that they were going to have to keep it as clean as was humanly possible in these conditions and to keep him relatively well fed, so as to keep his immune system up to scratch. Seans face was taking a very pale colour, with his freckles almost invisible against his skin. He looked around to see if he could locate Hannah. Hannah was nowhere to be seen. 'Crap' he thought to himself. He started to panic. What if something had dragged her of or she had run away on them or something stupid like that? He sincerely hoped not. They needed her and her skills to help them get through the forest, and for her to help him with Sean. That was when he heard a twig snap behind him. He whipped around quick and Seans eyelids began to flutter. Trevor looked round for something that he could perhaps use as a weapon against whatever it was that was quickly advancing to the spot where they had made camp. A glimpse of blonde hair made Trevor uncertain, but uncertainty quickly turned to relief as Hannah stepped through the trees. \"Hannah!\" he said joyfully, dropping the large stick he had aimed in her direction with a thud. \"yeah?\" \"oh good, I didn't know what it was there for a minute, I thought something was attacking us!\" \"Don't be silly, most animals in here would be too afraid to come anywhere near you!\" \"most but not all!\" he reminded her \"point taken.\" \"where were you anyway, I was beginning to think that you had run off on me or something!\" \"I wouldn't do that. Naaww I was away trying to see if I could find something to eat and drink. I think it's fair to say that I succeeded fairly well. And she brought out her rucksack from behind her, and unzipped it, displaying all its contents. Inside she had lots of exotic fruit, which came in various shades of red, green and yellow. There were also various types of greenery, which were accompanied by three or four large casks of fresh water that she had found dripping from a crevice in the rock in a ravine that was about hal a mile away from where they were located. \"wow! Well done! – where did you get it all?\" \"I'll tell you later, right now, I think the more pressing concern is Sean don't you?\" Trevor blushed but nodded, and turned back to where his nephew lay. He crouched down beside him while Hannah used her pocket knife to prepare the food that she had found. He put a hand to his forehead and noted worriedly that he was burning up, and perspiration had begun to coat his forehead. He gently shook him and Seans eyelids fluttered open. It took him a few moments to focus, and then the face of his uncle swam into veiw. \"nice to see you have returned to the land of the living\" Trevor joked. \"how do you feel?\" he asked Sean \"like crap\" he replied in a hoarse sounding voice. \"okay. Well can you sit up?\" \"yeah I think so.\" Sean tried to sit up with a grimace, succeeded, and then gasping said, \"Can I lie back down now?\" \"Sure.\" Using a hand to steady him, Trevor helped Sean lie back down, and he settled back down onto the forest floor panting with irregular, sharp breaths. \"Hey guys, the food is ready!\" Hannah called over to them. \"Right. Do you think you could move it over here? Sean isn't going anywhere right now\" \"Sure no problem!\" She moved it over to them, and they tried to feed sean lying down they were unsuccessful, and Sean who was currently choking on some sharp tasting melony thing, realized that if he wanted to eat, he was going to have to sit up. He inwardly winced at the thought, and managed to get the melon out of his airways, and into the shrubbery beside him. \"Trevor\", he said between gasps. I need to sit up!\" \"but – \" \"look I can't eat lying down, and I feel terrible already without the added torture of choking every five seconds!\" \"kay.\" Trevor gently hauled Sean up by his armpits, and dragged him tentatively over to a large tree, and wedging a a balled up jacket to act as a cushion behind his back to stop the tree rubbing against the wounds on Seans back, propped him up against the tree. Finally settled, and making sure that, nothing was digging into him, he let his head drop back into the bark of the tree, breathing heavily. He tried some more of the food, and the yellow thing was suprisingly sweet and very juice. He took several large swigs of water, and once full he fell asleep. The two others cleared up and discussed their plans for escape. \"I think that we should explore the island a bit more and see if we can find somewhere to set up a more substantial camp, while we figure out a way to get off this blasted island\" Trevor said. \"Usually I would be in agreement with you, but given Sean's current state i think we should give it a couple of days before we go anywhere.\" Hannah said. \"well how about this. You stay with Sean while I go explore, as I know more about our enviornment and you know how to keep people alive and survive?\" \"that would usually be a good idea but we don't have any means f communication and if something happened to you then how would we know, and furthermore what would we do? There is only so long that we can survive here trevor and considering that the tmeperature has kept rising at an alarming rate since we got here, it would suggest that it is going to keep going until the point where humans cannot survive it, and considering that it is near that point already then we really do not have that much time!\" She said all this very quickly, and Trevor blinked trying to process everything that she has just said to him. \" Well then I think that we should try getting back up one of the volcanic tubes again, but the only problem is the fact that the tubes are too long and we would have to wait for about a week until Sean was anywhere near ready to try something like that. What we need is a fast ascent in which we don't have to really do anything. Something like, a volcano explosion! A/N: Oohh a cliffie – again! Please read and reveiw and as I previously mentioned suggestions are more than welcome as I'm starting to show symptoms af that horrible disease known as writers block . Will probably take me a week or so to update as I have a lot of school shopping to do, as I'm starting GCSE's next year and need to locate a load of books and stuff. So yeah, please reveiw and I'll see you next week! Critisism welcome as this helps me make the story better![Chapter 4] Chapter 4. A/N: Hi guys – here is the new and improved chapter four. Beta'd by KittlyAbbz who I would like to pay tribute to as He/she has done a great job!. As usual there is a disclaimer, I do not own any of the characters and please rand r! \"Okay, so here is what I think. We need a quick, short ascent through the volcanic tubes, and we need to be sure that we are going to come out on the surface of the earth, where humans normally live.\" Began Trevor. \"My thoughts are going along the track that suggests the only thing that I can think of right now – hitching a ride on a volcanic eruption!\" He surveyed his companions. The look of utter shock and stunned disbelief told him that they obviously thought he had finally gone nuts, not that they hadn't thought that already, but this just confirmed it to their minds in the strongest way possible. He let them mull over it for a few moments, Sean, who was the first of the two to recover from the bombshell that had just been dropped on them, voiced this, in the not so eloquent way that is common among teenage boys. \"Are you NUTS?\" he shouted. \"Whoever heard of such a stupid idea? And this is coming from ME!\" he looked away, breathing heavily through his nose. \"Why what's wrong with it?\" Trevor asked confusedly. \"Oh I don't know, maybe the fact that you are asking us to hitch a ride on a substance that tends to incinerate people!\" Sean replied sarcastically. \"Yeah he actually does have a point you know Trevor\" this came from Hannah, who had just snapped back into focus at the sound of Seans raised voice. \"Yeah well what I was thinking is if we had something that was quite dense, like a rock, then perhaps we could lie on it and use it as a sort of raft and a barrier between us and the lava.\" \"Okaay.\" said Sean slowly. \"I think I understand where you are coming from now.\" He shifted his position slightly and his brow furrowed in a grimace of pain. Trevor wondered how Sean was going to fare with his idea when even the smallest amount of movement caused him so much pain. \"Well I don't know about rock,\" said Hannah slowly, \"but there are some pretty big what looks to be like dianasoaur skulls round in the open area near the volcano. We could use those!\" \"That's brilliant!\" said Trevor, cracking a tired smile. \"I know!\" she replied. \"When you guys have quite finished, maybe you could come up with a way on how you propose to get me there!\" Sean exclaimed. Hannah and Trevor exchanged a look, their faces falling. They hadn't considered that. Seans condition suggested that he was going to have to be moved very gently, and with the rough terrain, that could prove to be quite difficult. The midday sun was glaring down through the trees, and the temperature was continually rising. This suggested that they were going to have to act soon. \"Hannah, how far away do you think the dinasoaur skull is in relation to where we are now?\" \"It's not so far away from where we are now. About a hundred yards or so I would say. We are about half a mile away from the volcano,\" she answered. \"Perfect!\" said Trevor, clapping his hands together. \"We can just drag it back here with some, ropes, load Sean and our supplies into it and off we go!\" he said jubilantly. \"When we get back, I call shower first!\" said Hannah. \"Oh, and by the way-I'm still billing you!\" \"What! No way!\" yelled Trevor. \"Just kidding. C'mon let's go. You'll be alright here on your own for half an hour or so Sean?\" \"Umm... I'd rather go with you guys, but I'm sure I'll be fine here!\" he said quickly when he noticed their expressions. Then nodded and started to jog through the wilderness-towards where their means of escape layed. Sean craned his neck until he could no longer see them, and then he rested his head up against the tree that he was leaning against. He closed his eyes for a moment, when suddenly a little chirping noise sounded close by him. He opened his eyes in confusion, and then grinned when he realized it was his freind from that first day: the one that had shown him the water fountain. It hopped up his shoulder and nuzzled its tiny head up against his neck. He laughed, it was so tickly, he wanted to move his head and rub it against his shoulder to remove the feeling, but he was afraid of squashing his newound freind. Suddenly, there was a huge boom and the tops of the trees that were in his line of vision shook, dislodging some of that exotic fruit that he had liked so much earlier; a few dried leaves and some things that looked to be nests. 'Crap!' he thought inwardly. The only thing that could make that kind of sound, was somthing that was huge, like a dinasouar! He hoped that it wouldn't see him, or that it would bypass him completely even. But as usual, his look didn't hold unfortunately for him. He tried to shift his position a bit, but yelped in pain as the tiny movement twinged his injuries. Breathing heavily, he tuned onto his good knee and tried to crawl, dragging himself along on the two limbs that weren't that badly damaged. He managed to crawl along into a hollow of a particulary large tree. He dragged everything that showed signs of human life in there with him, and he covered the entrance of the hollow as best he could with huge green palm leaves, then lay there shaking with fatigue. Black spots danced around his vision, and he felt himself flop against his will against the rucksacks, which was convenient because they were actually pretty comfy. Unfortunately though, even as he looked down, his brain foggy with pain, he recognised the wet sticky feeling that was starting to blossom along under his bandages, and blood had started to seep through. All his wounds, with the exception of the cut on his head which now throbbed, had reopened. And that was bad news for him. He tried to shift so that he could get more bandages to rewrap his injuries, but instead unconsiousness overtook him and he fell down, down , down into the darkness. 39 minutes ago Meanwhile, Trevor and Hanna had found a suitable \"raft\" and were now tying ropes to it. Luckily, it wasn't really heavy, as it was only half of the skull, and it didn't have a bottom jaw. They looped ropes through the eyeholes, brought them up and around, and used the teeth belonging to the skull to secure it and stop the position of the ropes from shifting. Then they walked foward several yards ahead of the skull until the ropes were taught, and began to pull side by side. The skull when trailing behind them, was pushing the soil underneath it aside, and was making a useful rut that they figured they could use for the upcoming journey to the volcano, as this would make it easier with the additional weight of the supplies and Sean. They were hurrying now. They were both very worried about Sean; they wanted to be back by his side again soon in case anything were to happen or his condition to change. They finally broke through into the clearing, and were shocked and frightened out of their wits to find that there was no Sean, no supplies, but only a load of what appeared to be huge dinosaur tracks. They dropped the ropes and ran foward calling Seans name. They saw little spots of blood here and there when something caught Trevor's eye: there was a plastic clasp on the forest floor that was half buried. It look like the kind of thing that you use to secure the rucksack to your body. Beside it, there were a few round tracks, and a few spots of blood that were sparsely dotted along the trail. He followed it a short distance until he came to a huge tree, the tracks ending. Confused, he looked up to see if Sean had tried to climb the tree, but of course his nephew was nowhere to be seen. That was when he noticed that there were palm leaves lain up against the base of the tree, where the thick abd buttress roots were. He pulled away the palms and was shocked, but happy at the same time to find the prone figure of-\"Sean!\" he shouted; no response. \"Hannah, get over here!\" he called in a panicked voice. She stumbled over to him, tripping over the buttress roots, and peered inside the hollow to where he was pointing. She gasped when she saw the condition he was in. She went over to him and was alarmed to feel that he was quite cold. She felt for a pulse and was relieved to find that there was a heartbeat, however erratic. She noted with worry that blood was beginning to pool around him, and that most of his bandages were already completely saturated with his blood. She noticed then for the first time that the supplies were all around him and that he was lying on their rucksacks. She dug through her own bag to find a cask full of water and the remaining bandages. She just hoped that they would last until they got out of here so that they could get to a hospital. She removed all his bandages and gave them to Trevor so that he could find the water supply and wash them as best he could, so that they could be properly dried out and reused, dirty as they inevitably would be, they would be better than nothing and could probably be used for extra padding for when they loaded him into the skull. She washed all the blood off his body, washed his clothes free of all the blood, and still sopping wet, she hung them over a tree branch to dry. They waited for about an hour, during which they ate as much as they could, and filled every cask they had with water, and then loaded everything that they would need into the skull. By the time they were done, Sean's clothes were dry and Hannah dressed him again. They put Sean gingerly on top of the rucksacks, and began trailing the \"raft\" over to the place where the volcano lay. Sean was still out cold. They reached the side entrance to the volcano, wedged the skull in lengthways, and sat on it, trying to figure out ways to get the volcano to explode. Trevor examined the walls and noticed that they were very cold despite the fact that they contained lava. That meant only one thing. There was water on the other side of these walls. There was also magnesium veins, and he recalled himself nearly blowing the cave up with a flare. Hmmm... an idea starting to form in his mind. 38 minutes ago Top of Form Bottom of Form ","Summary":" Journey to the middle of the earth.

Well, this is a new story, this is the continuance to my story 'Journey to the Island of the Lost Dreams'. I suggest you read 'Journey to the Center of GET ME OUT OF HERE' and 'Journey to the Island of the Lost Dreams first, you kinda understand this story. For the ones who read them already, well Alyssa discovered everything was a dream, so this will get funny! She fell in love in a dream, ah poor Alyssa... Will she make Sean fall in love with her? or Fail at the attempt? And believe it or not, there will be one placed in 'Journey 2, the Mysterious Island'. Yeah, I'm really into this story:3 Anywaaaaay... Let's start with the story. Read and Review please!:3 We all stayed there. It had all being a dream, I couldn't believe it. I fell in love in a dream, I looked up at Sean, who took his phone out, Deja-Vú. Alright, let's start all again, I need to concentrate, okay. One, my name is Alyssa Ander-I mean, Evans, I'm not Anderson, I wish I was, though. I'm thirteen years old, not eighteen. I never dated Sean Anderson, but I do love him, and he hates me. I fell in love in a dream, with the jerkest, and most wonderfu-ALYSSA, anyway. Now, focus, I looked up at him again. \"I'm not getting any service in here!\" Sean said, oh, wait a minute... This already happened... I can handle this... I hope my dream is more than any dream. \"Lo-Sean. Don't be silly! Of course you won't get any service in here!\" I said, oh darn, I almost called him Love? What... This is going to be a long day. \"Lo-Sean?\" Sean asked confused, I rolled my eyes, and took his phone off, I turned it off, and walked over to the cave. \"GIVE. ME. MY. PHONE.\" Sean tackled me. Now, act normal. \"Get off me, reverend moron!\" I yelled and rolled over, so I would be on the top, oh dear, that felt so wrong, I quickly stood up and glared at him, her smirked. \"Why don't you get on top of me again that way?\" He asked charmingly, I kicked him, and walked over to one of the paths of the cave. \"Follow me. \" I said, Trevor and Hannah hesitated, but did as I said, Sean, instead, prefered to stay laying on the floor, I sighed and walked over to him. \"I also meant that for you, kiddo\" I said, he rolled his eyes and stayed there. \"Not until you give me my phone\" He said, oh what an idiot, and how immature of him. I rolled my eyes, and threw his phone at his face, he frowned as I giggled. \"Now, I won't stand up\" He said. \"Sean, come on! We need to get out of here!\" Trevor said from behind me. \"What an idiot\" I muttered. Sean rolled his eyes, and stayed there. \"Fine, then\" I said, and took both of his hands, pulling him, to the left path. \"Ow, Ow, OI! ALYSSA! LET ME GO! OW, THE ROCKS! OWIE! OKAY! OKAY! I'LL STAND UP.\" Sean yelled, I laughed, and let him go, he stood up and stepped closer to me, I crossed my arms with a smirk on my face. \"When we get out of here, I'll kill you.\" He said, poking me, I winked at him, and blew a kiss at him, then kept walking. Let's see, what happened in my dream? What happened in my dre-Oh shoot. Right, I looked down, at the large cliff infront of me. I looked at the left, to see the sign that said something in icelandic. \"That means keep out, this in an old mine and, yeah, \" I said, \"Now,Hannah. Mind giving me one of those luminous stick thingies?\" I asked, Hannah looked surprise. \"Wait never mind, give me rope\" I corrected myself, Hannah, Trevor and Sean looked at me. \"What?\" I asked. \"Oh nothing, just that, you know you are weird.\" Sean answered, I glared at him, but a smile appeared on my face, and yes, they looked at me weirder. \"Oh, well, this already happened in my dream. I think, this will be the same way,\"I said \"and I really hope it does\" I added quietly. They raised a brow and looked at each other. \"Look, we can see if it is acutally my dream by... Sean come here, Hannah give me one of those, thingies that glow, and Trevor, look up, there's magnesium in the ceiling.\" I said, as Trevor licked the cave, and nodded his head and Hannah searched in her backpack for the thingy. Sean looked nervously at the sign that had something in Icelandic written on it. \"You know, I know this is maybe not the time, but I would like to hear your dream.\" Sean said, not making eye-contact with me. I recieved the glow stick and looked at Sean, he walked over, and I asked him to look at his watch. \"Okay, I guess it will be 200 feet. Now, uh, Sean. I need you to count\" I said, and let the glow sitck go. \"One. Two.\"Thud. \"Almost three\" Sean said, Trevor did his maths. \"Yes, it is 200 feet...\" \"Now, your dream scares me\" Trevor added, I chuckled lightly. \"Now, we need to rapell down in there\" I felt really intelligent, normally I don't have that feeling. \"WHAT?\" Sean asked, yelling at me, I smirked. \"You scared, kiddo?\" I winked at him, he glared. \"Oh come on! It is nothing just like a 20 sotries building.\" I said, Sean's eyes widened. \"You are not helping\" He snapped, I smirked. \"What? You're man enough to call dibbs on Hannah, but you're not man enough to climb down there?\" I asked, with a smirk, remembering what Trevor had said in my dream. Sean gave me a death glare, while turning bright red and clenching his jaw. Hannah looked up confused at me, and I shrugged. \"As I said before, when getting out of this, I'm killing you, Evans\" Sean said, I smirked. Now, I had only one purpose, making him fall in love with me. \"Sean, come on! Don't be a baby and get down here!\" Trevor yelled from down in there , while Hannah, Sean, and myself were still up here, Hannah was going to tie me, I looked up at Sean, BINGO, I had an idea. \"Hannah, tie me up with Sean\" I said, calmly, Sean raised a brow. \"Seriously, you are getting weirder.\" Sean muttered, maybe he was hoping I wouldn't listen, but for his surprise, I did. \"It is not that I want to be with you. Is just that you will feel safer\" I added, in fact, I'm the one who will feel safer. \"Safer with you? ! Ha! Safer, with the person who hates me the most and will probaly kill me!\" Sean answered sarcastically, I rolled my eyes, he did have a point. \"No, that way we won't kill each other, because if one dies, the other one will die too.\" I ansered simply. \"I...No, better alone.\" He said, I frowned, darn you, Sean! \"OKay, then, die\" I added with a smirk as I tied myself with a rope and climbed down, Sean copied me. Then I realized, this wasn't like my dream, Sean wasn't nervous, I was. I was shivering, and I was sweating cold, I am not as brave as I was in my dream. I stumbled a bit, causing some rocks to fall on top of Trevor. \"Hey! Watch in there!\" Trevor complained. \"S-s-sorry\" I answered, don't look down, don't look down . \"You're looking pretty good there\" Sean teased, \"Sweetie\" He added with a wink, I glared at him. \"Shut up, Anderson. We are rappeling on schist by they way. \" I said, making the word, 'schist' sound like 'shit'. Sean's eyes widened, \"WHAT?\" he asked. I smirked, and then Trevor said \"Oh yes! We are rapelling on schist! It's a metamorphic rock!\" Trevor said and explained everything. Now that I think about it, how the heck in my dream did I knew all that? I mean, I'm not that intelligent, or maybe, I heard all that in my classes, when I wasn't really paying attention... Now that I think so, what do I do in my classes? Oh right ,I argue with Sean. I was trying not to stumble, when Sean chuckled. I glared at him,and said \"What's so funny?\". \"You look cute\" He answered, I raised a brow \"I mean, uh, like you are, funny\" He added, I raised a brow, cute? Didn't he hate me? I mean, I don't care if he likes me, because I like him, too. But... It is weird. Anyway, I kept climbing; not paying attention to any comment Sean made laughing at me. I ignored him until he said \"Watch Out!\" Too late, I'd already stumbled and had let the rope go, causing me to be hung and my rope een tied with the others. Sean cursed while I was hanging. \"Hannah! Cut my rope! Hannah cut my rope!\" I said, trying to balance. \"WHAT?,\" Sean asked \"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I hate you and all, but I won't let you die that way!\" I smiled, he didn't want me to die, he didn't hate me that much,... I think. \"Hannah! Cut my rope!\" I repeated, Hannah hesitated. \"NO!\" Trevor and Sean yelled in unison, when Hannah did as I told her. As I expected, the floor was just five inches from me, good thing, I sighed in relief and stayed there; the others climbed down, and Sean walked over to me, oddering a hand; I held his hand, and he helped me to stand up. \"So... You don't want me to die, huh?\" I teased Sean, he smirked. \" Not that way,\" He asnwered \"I would like to have the pleasure to do it myself\" Oh, how nice of him. I sutck my tongue out at him and walked over to the cave, where Hannah and Trevor were; Sean following me. \"Think this is, and abandoned mine tunel, well it looks that way to me\" Trevor commented, Hannah nodded in agreement. \"Bet is Old Blagils mine\" She said, and kept walking. We walked until we bumped into an old generator, I smirked, everything was going the same way as my dream, I hoped that it kept that way. Hannah walked over to the old generator, and I followed her, we both smirked looking at each other and started to press random buttons, pulling handles, and doing everything that was possible. \"You girls better not do that, Hannah, Alyssa, stop-Okay, okay I'll shut up\" Trevor said, as the old mine was all lighten up. I smirked. I looked around at the mine, my dream, my dream, what happened in my dream?. I saw two mine carts, oh now I remember, Sean and I looked at each other with a smirk, then looked back at the carts. \"I CALL SHOTGUN!\" He yelled, I chuckled and nodded, as I saw him running over it, he then stopped and looked at me. \"Aren't you going to fight me for it?\" He asked me, I chuckled and shook my head. \"Then, it doesn't have any fun! The point is fighting with you!\" Sean complained and walked over to me. I frowned. \"Then, this will be a boring day for you, I'm not planning on fighting with you\" \"Huh? Oh and why not? Did you finally fall in love with me?\" He stepped closer with a smirk, making me blush. Oh Yes, Sean, I finally did. \"Ew. No! Why would someone fall in love with you? \" I said pushing him away, he chuckled sarcastically. \"Well, I'm gorgeus,\" He stepped even closer \"You know, with my beautiful hazel greenish eyes\" He winked at me, and put his head infront of mine, that our lips were only an inch far. \"Ha, keep dreaming. I will never ever fall in love with you\" I answered, oh I'm really a liar. I ignored his smirk, and the butterflies, in my stomach, correction, the zoo in my stomach and walked over to the cart, when Sean jumped on it. \"Alyssa, Sean, no. Wait, we don't even know if the tracks are safe! We don't know if those things work!\" Trevor said, I rolled my eyes. \"Oh come on Trevor! This could be fun!\" I said, and Hannah came back with the mine cart with a handle, \"And perhaps, the track ahead looks good!\". Trevor sighed hesitantly, but agreed jumping on a cart. I bit my lip and walked over to the cart where Sean already was, I was going to jump in, but Sean oushed me, and I fell on my butt. Sean laughed histerically while I rubbed my butt. Iglared at him, and slapped his shoulder \"Ow.\" \"And that is nothign compared of what you hurt me! I hate you so much! Idiot!\" I punched him again and jumped in. How in this world did I fall in love with this jerk?[Chapter 2] A/N: Hello dear people! Sorry it took so long to update, but here it is finally! Oh, poor Alyssa... She fell in love with the jerk eat of them all in a dreaM! Alyssa: I hate you. Sorry, Alyssa, but you know that it had to be done. Alyssa: But... But... You promised! yes, I know, and it will be done, but shh! *Alyssa smirks* Sean: What? Oh, nothing to worry, Sean. *Alyssa looks at Sean with a dumb smile* *facepalm* Sean: What? Alyssa: What an idiot. Sean: Shut up dipstick! Alyssa: Ugh, you're such a dick! No, guys! No... Okay, while Sean and Alyssa fight (what a surprise) I'll do the disclaimer... I don't own journey to the center of the earth, I just own Alyssa and the scenes and lines tht don't appear in the movie... Guys! Stop! Ugh... Well... Read the story while I try to calm these two! Alyssa, no don't... Ahh! I frowned, and then realized something, oh dear lord, no. \"Sean, we have three options,\" I said, with him slightly turning his head around \"either me, wrapping my arms around you, you wrapping your arms wrapping your arms around me, or you dying\" He raised a brow at me. \"Where's the part were you die?\" He asked. \"No where, I wouldn't risk my life!\" I said, and frowned, turning around facing the front, Sean behind me. \"Well, then, I-this is definitely going to be awkward\" He said and wrapped his arms around my waist, my whole body tensed up. I couldn't believe it, I missed his arms even though I never had them, and in fact never felt them, my dream was so real... His arms were this same way. The ride started, and if you want to know, yes it was exactly like my dream, the same way. It was a roller coaster rose kinda-ish...at some point, like it happened in my dream the road was going to end, Sean's grip tightened I screamed as we landed, but got scared when we separated from Hannah and Trevor. \"NO! Sean! Alyssa!\" Trevor yelled, I sighed, as Sean's grip was getting even more tight, was that even possible? \" Sean I can't breathe!\" I yelled at him, as I gripped the cart tighter. \"Sorry!\" He said and he loosed his grip, the cart suddenly stopped and Sean jumped off the cart, with his face red, I jumped behind him. \"That was awesome!\" I said, with a smile, Sean turned around to face me and he looked at me with a brow raised.\"What?\" I asked simply. \"I almost died in there... And you say it was awesome?\" He frowned, and glared at me, with his stunning hazel greenish eyes. \"Exactly. You almost died in there, that's why it was awesome. Were you scared kiddo?\" I asked with a smirk, he glared at me. \"Hey, you guys, please don't start now\" Trevor said before Sean could answer me anything, Sean and I both turned to look at them, Hannah was on top of Trevor and they seemed that they had literally jumped of the cart, which I believe, they did. \"What happened to you guys?\" Sean asked with a chuckle, I grinned and walked over to a little cave. Oh yes, just like in my dreams. God, but they look even more beautiful. \"Rubies\" Sean said when he walked past me. \"Emeralds\" Hannah said taking one from the wall. I remembered my dream, oh no, I Wasnt going to let Trevor ruin the moment this time . trevor opened his mouth to say what he was supposed to say but- \"Yes, I know Trevor, feldspar\" I said, he looked at me skeptically and said \"How do you-\" \"Intuition\" I answered, Sean was still focusing on the rubies, I looked at him, and started to analyze his face, falling deeply into his eyes, looking at his freckled nose and cheeks, I stopped at his lips, he had just licked them, I didn't even know how, but I wanted to feel them, I wanted to discovered if they tasted like they did in my dream. \"Take a picture, it'll last longer\" Someone whispered in my ear, I felt my cheeks burnt, and I swear that I could almost see how my cheeks were turning as red as the ruby Sean was holding, I looked at Trevor with a confused look, trying to look inocent, and he winked at me. I shook my head and walked over to another part of the cave. \"Diamonds\" Someone said behind me, I slightly turned my head to see Sean's eyes brighting like... Well a diamond. \"Yes... \" I answered, as Hannah and Trevor also walked over, I bit my lip, thinking about my dream... Muscovite, muscovite... Trevor again explained about the volcanic tubes and how the diamonds were formed. \"Wait, Trevor if this is a volcanic tube then.: there's a possibility of getting us out of here?\" Sean asked. Oh Sean don't worry, there's no need to ask I'm pretty sure than in a few minutes were going to be falling and I will almost drown. \"Um... there's something I need to tell you guys...\" I said, but felt a hand over my mouth shutting it, I glared at Sean, who smirked. \"Just shut up, and grab diamonds\" He said, and pushed me to the closest wall, he pulled some diamonds into his backpack. I sighed and copied him, I looked down at the floor, Muscovite Muscovite . \"You know I know exactly what I am going to buy when we get out of here..\" Sean started to say. \"Let me guess,\" I said \"A Maserati?\" I asked him, his eyes widened and he looked at me suspiciously. \"You know Sean, money is not the only thing that matters\"Trevor started, I smirked, this could be fun... \"People matter too, we know, Trevor... And yes Sean even if you have a Maserati\" I said, trying not to laugh at their expressions. \"What... The... Do you read minds or something?\" Sean looked at me, I laughed softly. \"More like I can see the future,\" I answered him, \"Oh and Trevor were standing on muscovite, Sean close your backpack, in about a minute we will be falling... Oh and for everyone's reminder, I don't know how to swim. \" \"What in this Earth, do you mean?\" Sean asked me... I chuckled and showed him my hand, counting with my fingers, five four tree two. .. CRACK. \"Alyssa now you're scaring me... And whats muscovite?\" Sean asked looking at the ground. \"It's a kind of rock... Really thin... The slightest Change in weight pressure can shatter it. \" Trevor said, I sighed. \"Alyssa, Sean, walk over to where we are\" Hannah said, I nodded... But suddenly a doubt came to me... Should I take Sean's hand? No . We walked over, CRACK. More cracking noises, Sean and I stopped, and we looked at each other. The cracking noises stopped. \"Really calmly, come...\" Hannah said, we nodded and I felt my heartbeat raising. We were going to fall anyway, we needed I looked over at Sean's backpack to confirm if he had closed it, surprise surprise, he didn't. I saw the diamond falling out of Sean's backpack, I rolled my eyes, what an idiot... \"NO.\" He said and try to grab the diamond, but failed at the attempt. CRACK, I gasped in a really noticebale fake way, the rock didn't break, we all sighed in relief. Hannah, Sean and Trevor chuckled while I counted again with my fingers, five four three two one... CRACK. Yes, we were falling.[Chapter 3] We were falling, again, great... But, wait now I remember, I DID KNOW HOW TO SWIM. How did I forget? Why didnt I know how to in my dream? Did it mean something? Fate? Nah, maybe just a silly dream. I felt the cold air surrounding me as we were falling, we all screamed, and I closed my eyes. I opened and raised a brow, we were still falling... Was that even possible? \"WE ARE STILL FALLING!\"Trevor said, I rolled my eyes, you don't say? We all screamed again and held each others hand. After a few good minutes Hannah finally dared to ask \"Whats at the botton?\" Oh, trust me, Hannah, if everything goes according my dream, we are going tothe center of the earth. \"Well, if what Verne wrote was right, then it will go for thousands of miles!\" My heart almost stopped when I heard those words, what if it didn't happen the way it did in my dream? What if this time was the other theories? \"WHAT?,\" Sean asked, \"Great, we will die falling\" I gripped his hand tighter, making him let out a small \"Ow\" I apologized and loosened my grip. \"But,\" Hannah started \"VERNE WASN'T RIGHT! He is a fiction writer!\" \"Any other theories?\" Sean asked again, I remembered that comment I had made in my dream, but this time I wasn't stupid enough to make it. \"Well, our mothers will certainly kill us when we die!\" I stated, and Sean sent me a glare, I cracked a smile at him, and he rolled his eyes. \"Uh, well, it just ends!\" Trevor answered while nodding at my comment. \"WHAT? That is even worse! I won't get to buy my Maserati!\" Sean complained, I rolled my eyes, geez, how did I fall in love with him? \"Or...?\"I looked at Trefor waiting for an answer, he shrugged \"Well, as you said before, there could be water!\" Trevor said, I bit my lip and nodded. \"Like a water slide!\"I said, we all let each others hand go, and Sean started to pray, \"Water slide, water slide, water slide\" He mumbled, with his yes closeD. Hannah frowned, \"But what if the water formed stalagmites poitnig directly at us?\" \"Then,\" I scowled \"We would be skewered! We would die into pieces! Like... A ceramic figure!\" \"That, is also... Possible\" Trevor informed us. We all screamed again, and closed our eyes. I felt a small drop splashing on my face, I suddenly openEd my eyes, and saw we were being surrounded by water drops, Sean started to pray again, I giggled lightly, then it came, we were flushed into rocks, and finally splashed into the water, Sean, Trevor and I managed to swim, as we resurfaced I reached for my breath, and swam to the land, I coughed and looked at Sean and Trevor, wait a second...Where's Hannah? \"Um, Trevor, Hannah is missing\" I said, and Trevor looked around scared, he got back into the water and a couple of seconds later got back, helping Hannah. We all laid on the ground with a sigh, I looked at Sean from the corner of my eye, and followed his gaze, he was looking up curiously at the caves ceiling, it was covered won shiny little blue dots, that seemed to be stars. \"Is it just me... Or the ceiling is moving?,\" Sean suddenly popped in, sitting up, he then paused and looked at me, he realized I was watching him \"Didn't you say you didn't know how to swim?\" \"I lied,\" I answered simply, looking up, I sat up, and then stood \"Now, those are birds I believe\" My dream, they were birds right? A star-bird, suddenly moved, I smiled, yes it was. They all sat up, and the birds surrounded us while the were flying, \"Electric birds?\" Sean inquired, I shrugged, and looked at Trevor, expecting his explanation. \"They look like Cyanis rosopteryx. Only they're bioluminescent, like fireflies or glowworms. It's incredible.\" He said as in a matter of fact, I grinned, yes incredible. \"Hey, follow me!\" I said, and ran to a little cave, I grinned as I looked at my surrounding, my dreaM Was right, they all walked over following me, and opened their mouths amazed, I stood in front of them, turned to face the place, and said while raising my hands \"Lady, and gentlemen, I give you The Center of the Earth\" I turned to face Trevor, he would start yelling in three, two, one... \"MAX WAS RIGHT! HE WAS RIGHT! MAX WAS RIGHT!\" Trevor yelled and laughed, Then he turned to face Sean \"YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT! YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT!\" I grinned, sure he was, I paused, only I hope that one part of my dream isn't true. \"Your dad was right too, Hannah\" I stated, she looked surprised, she was emotionless,but before you could say \"Jules Verne\" Hannah was already running away, with a smile, looking around at the big flowers, we all followed her, she giggled. \"It seems impossible, doesn't it?\" Sean asked me, I nodded my head with a smile. \"Your dad, and Hannah's dad, they both believed in something that for everyone else thought impossible, bu hey, they were right\" I said, he smiled and nodded. \"The sky,\" I said, \"is like a terrarium, it's a world whitin the world, and all of this happened in my dream.. Kinda ish\". \"Your dream? What do you mean?\" Trevor asked me, I nodded and looked between them, they were all facing at me, with confused looks. \"I don't know, it's a sort of déjà-Vu, all of this happened in my dream, and many more things, I dont know why though.\" I bit my lip, they all gave each others weird glances. \"Well, then... Show us the path,\" Sean said, and stepped back, and gestured me to walk in front of them \"After you, my lady\" I walked, with the brightest smile that I ever had on my face, he called me his lady! What was I thinking? I shook my head, I should start forgetting about Sean. They followed me, and we walked across, we looked at the waterfall, and Trevor decided to take out the book, and started to read it \"The waterfalls, which for a long time, could be heard flowing from afar…now cascaded along the towering canyon walls…streaming along the rock with no end\" He said and then grinned excited. \"Thats what Verne wrote, right?\" Sean asked, I turned to face the boy with hazel eyes and nodded \"How... Did you know about all this?\" He asked, and I raised a brow \"I mean, this exactly happened in your dream but-\" \"OH! Yeah, I've read the book\" I answered, and he walked beside me and I felt the whole zoo dancing around my stomach, and my face burning red. \"Oh, you did? Wait-you know how to read?\" He teased, and smirked, yeah, it was too good to be true. I rolled my eyes, and walked faster, lettig him behind. \"Huh? Aren't you going to insult me back? Don't you have any good comebacks?\" He asked, and I stopped and faced him. \"Why should I fight back with an ape? Is not that you would understand, ape.\" I said with a smirk, and kept walking. We walked until we faced with the giant mushrooms, I smiled slightly watching them. \"Enormus fossilized mushrooms\" Tregor explained, and I was starting to fear what wascoming next, Seans dad... \"something like enormous fungus?\" Sean joked, I looked at him with a sarcastically and obviously fake chuckle. \"Oh, what a brilliant joke the ape just made!\" I said, and he glared at me \"scimmia sciocca\" I added in Italian, which means silly ape. \"what?\" Sean asked me raising a brow. \"Oh, you know your name!\" I said and kept walking, and saw the tree house, well, this was going to be interesting.[Chapter 4] Guys! I'm really sorry I haven't been updating! I've been the busiest girl and I kinda had writers block! But here it is! And I'll update the next one as soon as possible! Please review! I need some of your opinions! Well love ya all! Alyssa: she forgot me! Sorry! I have a lot of homework! Alyssa: Wait, I just read what you wrote! Oh my- *faints* sean: What...? Kiss her Sean! Sean: Uh.. No. *alyssa still fainted* Well, as we try to wake Alyssa up, enjoy this chapter!-Love Minnie. As we were making our way to the tree house, I was getting more and more nervous, but I couldn't tell Sean, I couldn't tell any of them. I felt someone nudging me. \"What's up Al?\" Sean asked me, I loooked up at him. \"Nothing,\" I answered \"just thinking.\" \"Uh-huh. About...?\" He expected me to answer. \"About how stupid you look\" I teased him, he frowned, and then chuckled softly. \"You never get tired, do you?\" He looked at me. \"Nope\" \" Well, you should stop you know... After we come back, we...you know, we're going to live together so we should start being friends\"He said, looking around nervously, I raised a brow living together? . I was confused, and paused, he also stopped and looked at me. \"What do you mean?\" I asked him. \"About Canada, I mean,\" He said, I kept watching him confused \"you know that you and your mom are also moving with us...\" \"WHAT?\"I almost felt my heart stopping, I was moving with Sean to Canada?! \"What?\" He asked confused \"Didn't you know? Our moms were talking about it when we picked you up..\" \"No-\" I paused, wait, I might have heard something. Flashback I walked downstairs as I saw my mom talking with Elizabeth, Sean's mom, at the edge of the door, they didn't seem to notice me so I stayed there and sat on the stairs frowning, I wasn't really paying attention to the conversation. \"Are you ready for it?\" Elizabeth asked, my mom shook her head \"Have you even told her?\" My mom shook her head again, \"No, I'm planning to tell her later...You know the fact that her and Sean don't have a good relationship would make her kill herself or something...\" \"Right. Yeah, Sean isn't happy either, well that's what he says, but-\"Elizabeth chuckled, that's when the conversation caugh my attention \"We both know they like each other\" \"Yeah, true... This trip will help them, to get used to each other.\" My mom answered, I stood up and walked over to them with my bag. \"Yeah, and the might acutally -Oh Hello Ally!\" Elizabeth waved at me with a smile, as my mom jumped and looked at me, I smiled as a greet \"Are you excited?\" \"Yeah...\"I answered simply and walked over to the car. End of Flashback I paused, and looked at him. \"Never mind, I remember\" I said simply, and walked over to the tree house, Sean and I ran inside it. I felt my heart sank, I knew what was coming next. I knew who lived there, and knowing it, killed me. Sean looked amazed at everything, and I sat on the hammock. Sean gazed through the notebooks, glanced at the stuff, he then looked at me with a smile, his eyes were shinning and he had a sparkle that made me fall in love deeper than I already was. \"This is amazing!Perhaps Lidenbroke lived here!\" He said, his expression suddenly changed. \"What's wrong?\" He asked me. I realized I was pale white, and I looked sad. Before I could answer anything, Trevor walked in. \"Sean, Alyssa?\" he looked at us, Sean walked over to him with a smile, showing him a notebook. \"Look! I think I found Lidenbroke's notebook!\" Sean grinned showing the notebook to Trevor. I stood up and saw that Hannah was outside, I walked out of the treehouse and joined her. \"Hey,\" she said \"Is it nice in there?\" She looked at the treehouse, I shrugged, and grabbed a little bottle that was hanging of the tree, it had something written on it, 'Max'. I looked at Hannah, she raised a brow. She walked over to the woods and I followed her. There he was, lying on the floor, he was all dirty and he had a scared expression. Max Anderson, was dead. Hannah looked over at me, I stared at the body with a blank expression. I paused, Hannah walked back to the treehouse and I stayed there, then they came. Sean quickly came and saw the body, his eyes and expression changed, the years quickly came up, and he sobbed. After we buried Max in the beach with some rocks , I walked over to Sean, I wrapped my arms around him and I hugged him tightly, he cried on my shoulder and I rubbed his back gently. \"I'm sorry, Sean, I whispered on his ear, he hid his head on my hair \"I really am.\" \"I never even get a chance to know him,\" he said as I let him go \"Now I know how you feel,\" he added muttering. I sighed, and looked down, I didn't even know who my father was, when my mom told my father she was pregnant, he left, changed his number and never called my mother again, what a man,huh? \"Sean, but you got your mom, you got Trevor, and even..: you got me\"I said, he looked up to me as he cracked a soft smile. \"Even if I'm a stupid moron?\" He asked me, I chuckled softly nodding. \"Even if you're an ape, you got me\" Trevor walked over to us with a little journal, I remembered there was a note, Trevor sighed and started to read the note:\"August fourteen, 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday. Six weeks ago I promised myself I would be home to give him his first baseball glove. Now I'm worried I'll never get the chance. I set out to make an incredible discovery to share here with Trevor and the world, but now, I would trade it all just to watch you grow up, to he the brave and certain man I know you will become. Happy Birthday Sean, I love you, Daddy\" Trevor's voice was shaking, and Seand pulled him into a hug crying on him, a few tears came from me, and I felt my whole body tensing up. Hannah and Trevor walked back to the treehouse, leaving me alone with Sean, he sat on the sand and I joined him, we stayed there, for A minute there was complete silence until Sean finally popped in. \"Why did we stop being friends?\" He said and turned his gaze at me. \"Don't you remember?\" I asked looking at him surprised, he shook his head, I sighed \"Valentines day...\" I added, he still seemed to be confused \"after you kissed me\" I finally answered. \"Oh,\" he said, \"right... I stopped talking to you.\" \"Yup,\" I said. \"Yeah, I-sorry, I mean... I didn't mean to end our friendship, I mean.. I wanted to be more, but then I freaked out and realized I'm only thirteen and... Yeah\" He stuttered a bit, which I found really cute if you wanted to know. I shrugged, \"I liked it,\" I answered him simply. \"Me too, but I guess we're kinda young, and perhaps we should just be friends, at least for now, because of two reasons, one, we still have some hate for each other, and two, we're going to live together ish, and if there is any problems... Well uh, no, just not now\" he finished looking back at the sea. \"So, you're accepting you had feelings for me?\" I asked, I tried containing my smile, but I couldn't, I was in love with that boy and I couldn't hide it, his cheeks suddenly turned bright pink. \"Let's get back into the house, Evans\" He avoided my question and stood up, I smirked and stood up, I followed him till we were alreay climbing to the treehouse. Before we entered, he paused and looked at me, \"Did that happen in your dream?,\" his voice was a bit soft \"about my dad I mean\". I sighed and nodded looking down, he sighed. He nodded and waked into the house. We both walked over to the hammock and layed down, I closed my eyes, but I didn't fall asleep. \"So... According to Max journal we're were surrounded by lava,\" Trevor said. \"Well that's wonderful, and good news\" Sean muttered sarcastically and I cracked a smile, and snorted softly. I suddenly remembered that this had all been in my dream, I sat up an looked at them. Trevor continued talking. ","Summary":" a/n: HELLO! Well, this is a new story, this is the continuance to my story 'Journey to the Island o"},{"Movie":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","Title":"Happy Birthday","Author":"Charlotte LeAnn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7098281","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Emma's POV *Beep Beep Beep* Ugh! Nothing can ruin my day more than when it begins with the sound of my alarm clock. I reached across my bed and slammed my hand down on the snooze button. I rolled around in bed a bit, snuggling underneath my covers, refusing to get out of my bed. Stupid alarm clock….wait, alarm clock? I didn't set my alarm last night... today's Saturday. Oh gosh! I bolted out of my bed and ran to my desk to check the date. Oh my gosh! August 14th! How could I have possibly forgotten! I got a rush of adrenaline then, becoming the most excited teenager on the planet. My best friend was coming home today! I finally get to see him after like, 6 months. Oh, and it was my birthday, but that's a minor detail. You see, I only saw my birthday as a minor detail because my best friend, Josh Hutcherson, was coming home today, and word on the street was that he had a party planned for some big event *cough*my16thbirthday*cough*. So I guess my birthday wasn't a minor detail, but either way, I was still more excited to see my crush…I mean friend! Okay, so I like my best friend, big deal. I suppose it kinda stinks because he has no idea, and he has a girlfriend, who just happens to be evil…and has the same birthday as me. But that's why this party is gonna rock! He's throwing it for me, not her. And it's not like I'm just guessing either. One of his friends, Jake, told me about it, and he said that Josh was super excited about it. Well, enough of that, I need to go get ready. *2 Hours Later* I had literally been standing near Josh's house for the past 10 minutes, freaking out. Josh texted me about an hour ago, and told me he was home…at his house…waiting for me. I don't know why, but on the way there, I started to get nervous. Maybe it was because I'm crazy about the guy, hadn't seen him in 6 months, and now the only thing I can think about is whether or not he missed me as much as I missed him. Okay, that's it. I need to stop being a baby and just go knock on the door. *Knock Knock* My hands are literally shaking! I feel like I'm gonna puke! Come on Emma, it's just Josh! I heard footsteps walking…no, running to the door. I felt like an animal on the discovery channel. You know when they talk about that whole, fight or flight thing? Yeah, that pretty much sums up what I was feeling. The door swung open, and I was scooped up into a very tight bear hug, and spun around. \"EMMA! I missed you so much! Oh my gosh! I'm so happy I'm back!\" Josh pretty much peed himself he was so excited. All I could do was laugh and shove my head into the crook of his neck. He smelled amazing, and he didn't look half bad either…hehe. \"Josh! I'm so happy you're back! Never leave me alone for that long ever again! Next time you go away, you have to take me with you, or I don't know what I'm going to do with myself!\" I said, keeping my arms firmly around his neck and just holding him…oh, and he didn't let go either. \"Come on, come inside, everyone wants to see you.\" He kept one arm around my waist as we walked inside the house. It was really nice to see everyone. His brother had grown so much, and I got the biggest hug from his mom and dad. We sat there for probably an hour, just talking and laughing. At around 2, Josh asked me to come with him to his room so we could catch up. I walked up the stairs, taking in everything. The pictures that hung on the wall of Josh as a kid just made me laugh. \"Hey, stop laughing!\" he giggled. \"Oh, come on, you used to be so cute! I'm not really sure what happened though,\" I teased. \"Haha, very funny. I forgot how much I missed your witty, sarcastic remarks,\" he rolled his eyes, and opened the door to his room. I walked in and sat down in the center of his bed. He closed the door and then ran at me. I screamed, and he tickled my sides until I cried. Then we just laid there, sorta holding each other, and staring at each other. \"So, I've got this party planned for tonight,\" he said, after like, 5 minutes of silence. \"Oh really, and what's the occasion for such a party? A birthday perhaps?\" I decided to go along with whatever he was playing at. I suddenly realized that he hadn't said happy birthday to me, which was weird because he's never forgotten my birthday…not once. I brushed if off as soon as he smiled at me and sat up. \"Okay, so, wear something nice, be to my house at 7. This is me formally inviting you by the way.\" He was so adorable. We hung out for a little bit longer, and then I went home and got ready for the party.[Chapter 2] I decided on a pair of dark skinny jeans, because I was not the type of girl that wore dresses or skirts for anything other than dances and weddings. I picked a pretty blue tank top, with sequins on it. It was one of Josh's favorite shirts. It was 6:45, so I grabbed my stuff, threw on my black chucks, and walked over to Josh's house. It was a bit odd, because there were no cars there, but I suppose he told everyone to park somewhere else to sort of, keep the party a surprise, even though it wasn't. I walked up to the door, this time ringing the doorbell. Josh came and opened the door, and his jaw just about dropped to the floor. I giggled, and blushed a bit, waiting for him to say something. \"Um, w-wow! You look amazing!\" he was so funny when he didn't know what to say. \"Thanks, you don't look so bad yourself.\" He was wearing some dark jeans, which were my favorites on him, a white t-shirt, and a plaid button up over it. He had his hair gelled up, like he always does, and once again, he smelled amazing! He led me through the house into the backyard. It was beautiful! There were lights everywhere: in the trees, along the tables, all throughout the yard. There were flowers, and lots of people. I saw Jake right away, and when he looked at me, he had a pained expression on his face. I made a mental note to find out why as soon as I was done freaking out about how beautiful my party was. \"Josh, it's beautiful! I've never seen anything more spectacular in my entire life!\" \"Good, I'm glad you like it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go wrap a few more things up.\" With that he walked back into the house, and I stood there gazing at everything. I suddenly remembered Jake, and I searched the sea of people until I found him. I made my way towards him, and realized I only knew a few of the people that were there. When I reached Jake, he looked down at me, with that same pained expression I had seen earlier. \"Hey Jake. Isn't this beautiful? I can't believe he did all this for me! It's a bit weird though, because he didn't actually say Happy Birthday, and I don't actually know many of these people, but it's okay, because it's the thought that counts.\" His facial expression got worse. \"Jake, what's wrong?\" \"Well…. Happy Birthday!\" his voice sounded tight, like his throat was closing up. \"Jake wh-\" he cut me off. \"Emma, I'm sorry but this party, it's-\" he was cut off when someone ran outside and yelled, \"She's here! Everyone, get ready!\" A feeling of dread washed over me. But it couldn't be true. This party was for me, right? I looked at Jake, and he just put his arm around my shoulder, and looked forward. I heard the slider door open, and out walked Josh, and what I considered to be my worst nightmare.[Chapter 3] There she was, the perfect picture of pure evil. She was covered in pink and sparkles, and plenty of makeup. I felt the tears start to form. Jake's arm moved from my shoulders, to my waist, and he grabbed one of my hands with his other, doing his best to comfort me, without drawing any attention to us. Everyone yelled, \"SURPRISE!\" I couldn't believe it. I had spent the last three months thinking that Josh was planning this amazing party for me. But it wasn't. It was hers. Remember that devil woman I described earlier? You know, the one that has the same birthday as me? Yeah, he threw this party for her. He forgot about my birthday, and remembered hers. I guess it's understandable, because she's his girlfriend and everything, and he's known her for what, a year? I hated him, and that devil of a girlfriend that he had. Sarah, her name is Sarah. Sounds pleasant, doesn't it? Don't let the name fool you. She's a natural born bitch. She started freaking out, totally overwhelmed by the entire thing, and grabbed Josh. \"Oh my gosh baby, thank you!\" she pulled him down, and kissed him. They sucked face for way longer than I wanted to see. After they finished their little lip lock, the party began. The music started, and people started dancing. I looked up at Jake, squeezed the hand that was holding mine, and buried my head into his chest. \"I'm so sorry Emma,\" he whispered. I hadn't shed any tears yet, but I knew they were coming. I let go of him, and told him I was going to leave. He nodded, gave me one last hug, and then started to let go, but then quickly pulled me back. Josh was coming towards us, with that thing practically attached to his arm. \"Hey guys! Don't you wanna say something to me?\" Sarah more demanded, than asked. \"Um, happy birthday Sarah,\" Jake mumbled back, keeping his arm firmly placed around my waist. I caught Josh's eyes look down, and then look back up, giving Jake this confused sort of glare for a split second. \"Emma?\" she questioned. \"I don't know, maybe. Isn't there something people should be saying to me?\" I questioned her right back, almost begging for a fight. I desperately wanted to rip her bleach blonde hair out of her head, and then strangle her with it. And don't even get me started with what I was going to do to Josh. \"Emma! Come on, it's her birthday! Can't you just be nice to her?\" Josh begged. Sarah pretended to be hurt by the comment, but I knew better, and I knew Josh did too; he just didn't want to get in trouble with her later. \"I can't believe you! How could you forget! I thought you coming home was going to be the greatest thing ever, but I was wrong. I never want to see you again!\" And the flood gates were let open. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I ran out of the yard. I ran through the house, through the front door, and as far away from him as I could. I heard the front door open, and there Josh was. He came running after me, but I was too far away. I ran as fast as I could to my house. By the time I got to my room, I had about 12 missed calls and texts from Josh. I turned my phone off and got into the shower. I don't know why, but for some reason, the hot water always helped me feel better. It didn't this time. It just made me cry harder. I got out of the shower, and went to bed, thankful that at least my parents remembered it was my birthday. Hopefully tomorrow will be much better. So far, being 16 sucks.[Chapter 4] I woke up with a hangover like headache. I had no idea that crying that much could make you feel that bad. It was around noon when I woke up. My parents were at work, and I guess they decided to let me sleep in after the night I had. They really had no idea, but when I walked in the house, they knew something was wrong. Thankfully, they didn't pry. I got out of bed and took a shower. When I got out, I put on some shorts, and a white tank top, and went downstairs to eat something. I didn't bother putting on any makeup or doing anything to my hair. I grabbed my phone and checked my messages. Wow, 37 missed calls and texts. Of the 37, 35 were from Josh, and 2 were from Jake. I listened to those 2, but ignored the other 35. I didn't want to talk to him. I decided I was in the mood for breakfast, so I made some pancakes, grabbed some orange juice, and ate my food on the couch, while watching MTV. I was in the middle of Super Sweet 16, ironically enough, when the doorbell rang. I ignored it and kept watching. After the third time it rang, I decided I should probably answer it. When I opened the door, there stood Josh. I rolled my eyes and tried to slam the door in his face, but he was too smart for that. He put his foot in the door, and pushed it open. \"Come on Emma, talk to me. What did I do?\" he pleaded as I pressed my back against the door, doing my best to shut it, but he was too strong. He gently shoved the door open, and walked into my house. I tried to run upstairs, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back. I wrenched my arm out of his grasp and slapped him across the face as hard as I could. \"Get away from me! I told you, I don't want anything to do with you! Do you have any idea how you made me feel last night?\" I had never yelled at him like that. He reached up and felt his face. He looked totally shocked, and at this point there was nothing I could do about the tears that were flowing freely down my cheeks. \"Emma, I-\" \"No! Do you even know what last night was?\" I asked him, and he remained silent. \"Wow. You really don't know, do you? I can't believe you! You've known me your whole life! And you've only known her for a year, but you…you…\" I broke off here, unable to go on. \"Emma, please, just tell me. Sarah was so upset last night. I know you don't like her, but did you really have to let what was between us ruin her birthday?\" Well, at that statement, I found the words to continue. \"RUIN HER BIRTHDAY! ARE YOU SERIOUS! I HATE YOU JOSH! I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!\" He looked like his heart had been torn in two as soon as I said that. \"No, Emma! I…I…Please, don't say that! I'm sorry!\" He closed the gap between us in 3 long strides and he held me with everything he had. I screamed, pushed, shoved, and beat on his chest, but it was no use. He didn't let go. I tried as hard as I could to get out of his grasp, but I couldn't. I started to get tired, and eventually just gave up. I let him hold me, and I just cried into his chest. I wrapped my arms around him, and let all of my frustrations out. I've never cried so much or so hard in my entire life. After we had been standing there for about five minutes, he picked me up and carried me to the couch. He placed me on his lap and continued to hold me, stroking my back and trying to comfort me. He was crying too. I could feel his chest heaving up and down. I finally calmed down after I don't know how long, and Josh started to play with my hair. He kept placing little kisses on top of my head, and making small circles on my back. We stayed like that for a long time, and then he broke the silence. \"Emma, please, tell me what I did. I promise, whatever it is, I'll make up for it. I just can't take having you mad at me. I felt like the wind had been knocked out of me when you told me that you hated me. Please, just, tell me?\" he begged. I looked up at him, my eyes very red, and very puffy. He wiped the few tears that were starting to fall. I looked into his eyes, and I knew he felt terrible. \"Josh... yesterday was my birthday…\" I trailed off, and watched his face change from pleading, to puzzled, then to this, \"Oh shit\" expression. It's like it finally clicked. He didn't say anything for a while, it was like he couldn't. He just pulled me closer to him and rocked me back and forth. \"I can't believe I forgot. I'm so sorry! I was a complete ass! And then what I said to you when I came in…I...\" this time, he trailed off. \"Josh, it-\" \"No, you're right. I've known her for maybe a year, spent 3 months planning this party for her, and I've known you my whole life and completely forgot about you! You gave so many hints yesterday, and I never caught on! I'm so sorry, please forgive me? I swear, I'm going to do everything I can to make it up to you,\" he was back to the pleading look again. I don't know what happened then, because I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't hold it back any longer. I reached up, grabbed him by the back of the head, and slowly brought his lips down to meet mine. I kissed him with everything I had. At first, he didn't kiss back, so I started to pull away, totally devastated, but then he moved his face closer to mine, and pulled me back. I couldn't believe it, Josh Hutcherson, was kissing me. I kissed him, and he was kissing back. He picked me up from the position I was in, and made me straddle him. It wasn't anything…dirty; it just made kissing a lot easier. He ran his hands through my hair, and down my sides, while I kept pulling on his hair and running my hands down his sides. I tried to kiss his neck, but he wouldn't let me, he just kept attacking my mouth. We both pulled away, reluctantly, when neither of us could breathe. We were both panting, and he touched his forehead to mine. I had never been so happy in my entire life. He reached for my hands, which were currently around his neck, and entwined our fingers together. He kissed both of my hands and then looked at me, with something in his eyes that I had never seen before. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" he asked. \"Tell you what sooner?\" I replied, unsure if he meant my birthday…or something deeper. \"That you felt this way. You should have said something.\" I giggled at this. \"What was I supposed to say? That I loved you?\" \"Well, do you?\" he asked, with slight challenge in his tone. \"Well….I don't know. I suppose I do. Do you love me?\" I asked, hoping to hear the words that I'd been waiting for. He chuckled, \"Happy Belated Birthday, Emma.\" He kissed me again, a slow kiss; full of…something I couldn't quite place. \"I love you,\" Ahh, that was it. The kiss was full of love. \"I love you Josh\" ","Summary":" Emma's POV *Beep Beep Beep* Ugh!

I Don't Own Journey to the Center of The Earth. I Just own Katie and Vanessa. \"Katie; I only want what's for the best. Sweetheart\" She said to me. She put my hand on my right cheek while her left hand is on the coffee table. I Stood back and slammed my fists on the table. \"Whats best for me?\" I yelled in her face, frustrated, heated up and angry. Then there was a knock at the door. Mom sighed and got up to answer the door. \"Wait here\" She said to me and then goes to answer the door. \"Oh Sure! Like i've got anywhere else to go\" I snorted and got out my PSP and sat on my mom's favourite rocking chair that she made herself in shop class in '88 and played with my PSP. She opened the front doors and turned over to me. \"Oh look honey. We've got visitors\" I Snorted and sniffled. \"Great, who else could bother us at 3'o clock in the mornin'\" My mom turned over to me. \"These two lovely gentelman over here\" Mom said I Rolled my eyes. \"Oh Lemme guess, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\" My mother turned over back to the two gentelmen. \"Hi. Im Vanessa and you are?\" \"Hi. Im Trevor and this is my nephew Sean\" Trevor replied Mom smiled. \"Please, Do Come in\" Sean and Trevor stepped inside the house and took off their shoes as the \"Japanese Common Courtesy Rule #475\" sign of respect. They sat down on the couch. \"I found this in my dad's box\" said Sean Sean hands over the book entitled 'Journey to the Center of The Earth'. Vanessa looked questioned as she held the book. \"My late brother had a copy of the book\" Mom said Vanessa got off her chair and grabbed the book off the bookshelf, sat back down on her black leather chair and placed the replica of the book down on the table beside the original book and opened up the both to the notes pages. \"You see this? The markings are exactly the same. Your father was a vernion\" Mom explained to Sean \"Whats a vernion?\"asked Sean \"People who believe that the writings of Jules Verne are fact. Your father was definetly a vernion. Apart of a secret society\" replied Vanessa \"Max was no vernion or apart of any secret society\" protested Trevor \"Yeah.. My dad was kinda out there\" Sean muttered akwardly \"You didn't know him Sean\" said Trevor \"Like you did\" retorted Sean \"Excuse me, He's my brother. I've known him my whole life.\" replied Trevor \"Sure you have\" retorted Sean Katie rolled her eyes. \"Now your making Max jokes\" Sean looked curious. \"How do you know about my dad?\" \"Hey! The lad died when you were only three anyway, So you point isssssssss?\" Trevor look curious. \"How did you know that Max died when Sean was three?\" Vanessa gulped. \"Our family is kinda like physcics\" \"Physcics?\" questioned Trevor \"Sadly, Yes\" replied Katie \"How 'bout i take you guys up to that moutain just outside of town, A few miles from the house\" suggested Vanessa \"Thats a great idea! How much will you have to bill me?\" asked Trevor \"$10,000\" Katie replied \"A day! No problem\" Trevor said happily \"An hour\" My mother corrected. Sheesh! My mom's sharp as a kitchen knife. Trevor's smile turned to a frown. \"Your serious?\" asked Trevor Vanessa nodded her head. \"Will you accept rolls of quarters?\" asked Sean Now that made me giggle. \"We'll take whatever you've got.. For now that is\" Sean reached into his pocket and pulled out a five dollar bill and a game token. \"All i got is five bucks and a game token.\" I Snickered. \"It'll cover your trip... Until you pay the grand total at the end\" \"Oh great\" said Sean Trevor reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet and opened it. He pulled out $500 and handed it over to Mom. \"Here you go\" \"It'll do\" Katie shaked her head and blinked. \"How 'bout you guys stay over and we can start fresh in the morning?\" suggested Katie \"Good idea\" replied Vanessa \"But we only have two rooms. Where are Trevor and Sean supposed to sleep?\" Mom asked \"I've got a compromise, How 'bout Trevor and Mom sleep in Mom's room. Sean can have my room and i'll sleep out on the pullout couch.\" suggested Katie \"Thats a great idea\" Mom said to me \"I've never slept in a girl's room before but this is my time\" said Sean. Then he shrugged his shoulders. \"Ok, It's late. so lets all get some sleep and we'll all good in the morning\" instructed Mom I Ran up the stairs into my room and put on my checkered pajamas while mom was setting up the pullout couch and Trevor and Sean were finally asleep in their rooms, Not to mention that Mom and Trevor are sharing the room and BED!!! That i can't imagine. The next morning, I Was still sleeping on the pullout when my mom is standing infront of me. I gave her the finger. \"Ma, gimme five more minutes\" I said nasally Mom went to the back of the couch and rolled me off the couch. \"MOM!\" Mom shook her head. \"Katie, we got 14 hours of sleep, NOW LETS GET UP!!\" \"Whats for breakfast?\" I asked \"Bacon, Eggs, Cinnamon Toast, Hash Browns and Orange Juice\" Mom replied I got my lazy butt of the couch and went up my room. I put on a hot pink with a gold eagle on it, then umber 1987 in the corner and a whole bunch of scribblings on it, Black jean capri that go above my knees and my black AIRwalk shoes. I grabbed my pink and white messenger bag with the essentials, Clothes,Makeup,PSP,Automated Lightup Passowrd Diary,Sketchbook,Pencil Case,Watch,Cell Phone,Etch-a-Sketch,Teddy Bear,IPOD and Jewellery. I also got my hands on my hiking bag which includes, Food,Water,Sleeping Bag, A extra change of clothes incase mine get wet,Compass,Map and a ball of cheese. I ran up down the stairs with my stuff and set it down with with everyone elses stuff and walked over to the dining table and sat down beside Sean and started to eat my breakfast. My mom looked curious and turned over at me. \"Why do you need two bags for? It's only a hiking trip.\" My mom asked me \"Incase you and Trevor get us lost\" I replied sarcastically \"What's in the bag? Asked Sean \"Clothes,Makeup,PSP,Automated Lightup Passowrd Diary,Sketchbook,Pencil Case,Watch,Cell Phone,Etch-a-Sketch,IPOD and Jewellery.\" I replied \"I Bet Mom's gonna get us lost, She can't even read a map\" I said to Sean sarcastically. My Mom dropped the fork looked mad. \"Hey! Why are you picking on me for?\" \"Cause everyday can't be 'Pick on Sean' day\" i replied Trevor and I laughed our asses off until we were tired of laughing at them.[Chapter 2] The Crazy Adventure Disclaimer: I Don't own the plot of the story. I Don't Own Journey to the Center of The Earth. I Just own Katie and Vanessa. Outside of the house, Mom was putting all of our stuff in her car. Before she put the bags in the trunk, I snuck out my metallic pink IPOD so i can listen to music on our way and during the trip. God this is gonna be a fucking massacre. Ladies and Gentelmen, Let's see what happens. Shall we? Me and Sean were sitting in the back of the car since either of us can't drive. Mom and Trevor were sitting in the front. Mom drove since Trevor couldn't be trusted because he drives like a monkey flinging his doodoo at another monkey. I was searching through IPOD music to listen to. \"Eww... Janis Joplin!! Ugh!\" I snorted \"Blech! Alicia Keys.. What was i thinkin'!!\" I Continued searching and finally. \"Aww Sweet! Paramore!\" Sean and Trevor groan. \"Are you hard of hearing?\" the two asked \"No\" I replied innocently \"Will you shut up!!!\" Mom yelled at Trevor AND Sean Trevor and Sean finally shut up and continued the quiet car ride. Katie broke the silence. \"Can't we sing some car songs or something?\" asked Katie \"What car songs?\" asked Sean \"Pop on the Wall\" I replied Mom smiled. \"I love that song\" Mom began to sing. \"80 Bottles of pop on the wall, 80 bottles of pop... When one of those bottles just happen to fall... 79 bottles of... pop on the wall\" Trevor joined along. \"79 Bottles of pop on the wall, 79 bottles of pop... When one of those bottles just happen to fall... 78 bottles of... pop on the wall \" I joined in. \"78 Bottles of pop on the wall, 78 bottles of pop... When one of those bottles just happen to fall... 77 bottles of... pop on the wall\" Sean finally joins in. But he has a screechy voice. \"77 Bottles of pop on the wall, 77 bottles of pop... When one of those bottles just happen to fall... 76 bottles of... pop on the wall\" Everyone continued singing the song until Then they finally arrived at the mountain. The four got off the car. Mom opened up the trunk and handed our stuff. I put my messenger bag on first, then my hiking bag. We all walked up the mountain and so far, we are only half way there. Trevor and Sean already stopped to catch their breath. Judging by the lack of excercise, I guess their out of shape. \"DIBS\" out called Sean \"Dibs, on both the girls\" \"Dibs, Sean? Your thirteen Sean. You can't call the shots on both\" pointed out Trevor \"Sorry! Called it\" shouted Sean \"Bu.. But...\" Trevor stammered \"GET OVER IT\" The two finally continued walking up until Trevor opens bigs mouth. \"Vanessa, Katie. Can you slow down a little bit please?\" 20mins. Later, The four are standing infront of a silver blinking box. Everyone look questioned. \"This is everything i need to know.\" muttered Trevor Vanessa turned over to Trevor. \"What\" she asked \"This box has recorded information from the last 10 years that i need to know\" Trevor replied. \"What do you need that ratty old box for?\" I asked sarcastically... Again \"This Ratty Old Box contains sisemic information that i need to know from the last 10 years.\" replied Trevor \"How you gonna unlock it?\" Mom asked Katie rolled her eyes. \"Yo! Lemme kick it!\" I yelled. \"No\" bellowed Trevor Vanessa looked up, She heard thunder and the sky turning grayish-black and it was getting a tad windy. She gulped in scarce. Then she turned her over to Trevor. \"Umm, Trevor? Im really sorry but were gonna have to go now\" Mom warned Trevor hastily so we could leave and hurry home. \"No, Not till i get this box. Now go to that cave and get some cover. Take the kids with you. Now!\" he ordered. \"Kids!\" Mom yelled from across the mountain, Sean and Katie ran over to Mom, and then we ran into the open cave while Trevor was out in the unsafe thunder storm playing 'Tug-of-War' with that box. He continued pulling on that stupid box until heard a small clicking noise and pulled it out. He put a smile on hus face. \"Got It!\" shouted Trevor The thunder blew and tried to strike Trevor and mad dashed like hell to the open cave and tried to Dodge the lightening. Mom screamed. \"Trevor! Drop the box! It's the attracted to the lightening!\" Mom screamed Thunder striked and Trevor dodged the thunder. \"No! Im not gonna drop it!\" Lightening came and striked Trevor in his ankle and dropped the Sisemic box and the lightening hit it and the box exploded. Trevor ran and dived into the cave then BOOM! The rocks fell and blocked the opening and we all fell and lost conciousness for about 5mins. Persay? I Woke up and coughed. Then Sean woke up, coughed and dropped his jaw and yelled. \"Guys! Guys! Help me Dig!\" yelled Sean. Mom and I took off her sweatshirt and hiking gear and helped Sean dig out, Trevor the bohemian was still passed out like a monkey. Sean sighed and kept digging. \"Man; this is hopeless\" Mom shook her head. \"It's not hopeless. Just dig dammit!\" Trevor finally got up and helped dig. I Stepped away and hoplessly screamed the words and i quote 'SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP US!!!' Sean turned over to raised his right eye. \"Who the hell is gonna hear us in a cave?\" \"I Hope we can get out of here. Katie? Did you pack extra stuff?\" Mom asked me \"I Packed for a hiking trip, NOT a freakin' cave entrapping\" I replied in technicallity \"I Specifically told you to pack extra things incase\" Mom yelled \"Technically, you said 'Just pack for the short hiking trip'\" I remarked technically. I began a sarcastic rant toward Mom: \"Oh now this is just fucking great, This isn't a hiking trip, this is a fucking nightmare stuck in a cave! With two boys! Whats wrong with you?! I Could've stayed home and went to Erika's w. Claire party but nnnnnnnooooooooo you had to drag me to this shithole with two other idiots who call themselves scientists. Now look what you and Mr. So-Called-Scientist did? You got me in this cave while i could be at Erika's house party drinking my ass off silly but you had to make me come here to this shithole. This is mutiny i tell you. MUTINY!!!! Get me the fuck out of here. Were clearly not gonna survive here anyway! Were gonna die and never be discovered. Your a fucking whacko mom!! and you! *Points at Trevor* You had to go get that stupid box. What are you? In love with it or something? Thanks to you you dumb idiot, Were lost and in this fucking mess because of you, If you were a mathmetician , You'd be able to build a goddamn time machine and fix this mistake. Mr-SO-CALLED SCIENTIST!!\" Trevor looked mad. Mom yelled at me in German again.. Who is she kidding and i started to yell. \"SHUT THE FUCK UP!!\" I Yelled loudly. Trevor and Sean looked shocked. My mother looked insulted. Then we continnued walking up to some Mine shaft where 4 carts were parked. I Turned on the Generator nearby. Sean looked worried. \"Uh, I wouldn't turn that on. It could be dangerous\" warned Sean I snorted. \"No it's not!\" After that remark, The lights went on and the carts still were.. still! I Got in the front. \"Get In!\" I shouted \"Sweet, I get the second cart\" called Sean \"Great\" Mom muttered sarcastically \"I'll push the cart\" \"I Get the last cart\" moaned Trevor Trevor and Sean got in their planned carts and Mom got way in the back to push the cart. We finally get going. Were going 78MPH until we all split apart and went our own septerate ways. \"WOOHOO!\" I shouted And then it hit me. My track was going to end until i reunited with Sean. I Turned over to Sean and he warned me. \"Get in my cart! Your track is going to end! Get on now! I'll catch you. I promise!\". As if i was gonna believe him. I turned back and look at the short track. I quickly got to the bottom edge of my cart as Sean held his arms out and i jumped. He caught me just like he promised. Aww! Thats so sweet. I hugged him tightly. \"Thanks\" I said to him He smiled and then we turned over to my falling cart. Sean's eyes widened. \"Good thing that wasn't you\" He said I Shrugged. \"Yeah, Glad it wasn't\" Unfourtunately, Mom AND Trevor were seperated and the same thing happened again. And then it hit her. Her track was going to end until she reunited with Trevor. She Turned over to Trevor and he warned her. \"Get in my cart! Your track is going to end! Get on now! I'll catch you. I promise!\". As if she was gonna believe him. She turned back and look at the short track. Mom quickly got to the bottom edge of my cart as Sean held his arms out and she jumped. He caught me just like he promised. Aww! Thats so sweet. Mom hugged him tightly. \"Thanks\" She said to him He smiled and then we turned over to the falling cart. Trevor's eyes widened. \"Good thing that wasn't you\" He said Mom Shrugged. \"Yeah, Glad it wasn't\" Things turned to an awful twist when the track for them was gonna end. Mom grabbed her grapple, aimed it at the wall and clicked the trigger. The two held the rope connecting to the grapple and jumped out of the cart that crashed into the wall. They were covered in dust and gravel. They wheezed and coughed. \"That wasn't a proper way to save a life\" Trevor pointed out \"That was our only hope\" Mom said to him Hours later, The four finally reunited and headed to a cliff leading to a cave. I got out a glowy stick and light it up. I threw it down and Sean looked at his digital watch and counted. \"1...2...3\" counted Sean He turned over to me and said. \"Almost three\". Like i believed him. I grabbed another glowy stuick and lit it up and threw it down. I looked at my watch and counted. \"1..2..3..4..5..6\" I counted. I turned over to him and said. \"Six seconds\" then i looked back down. \"Got rope?\" I asked Mom got out 200ft of rope. \"I always come prepared\" A few minutes later, Trevor, Mom and I were already a few feet down on the cliff, Sean just had started climbing down, He was shaking like salt come out. \"Hey Katie, do you come here often?\" Sean asked in a shaky way Trevor laughed. \"Is that the best you can do?\" Then he lost his balance and fell... yelled in gibberish. Mom turned over and saw Trevor dangling beside the cliff and I zipped up the cliff by half a foot. Mom turned over and yelled. \"Looks like you caught on something. Your rope is caught on mine, Were gonna have to cut you loose\" Trevor leaned up. \"Wait! No No No No No!\" \"Vanessa No!\" Sean yelled Mom grabbed her knife and cut the rope. Trevor fell about 2 seconds and fell on the ground. His big butt broke his fall. Some rope fell on him. \"Hey Guys, I found it\" said Trevor. As Me, Sean and Mom finally landed on foot from the cave cliff. \"Lets keep walkin shall we\" I suggested[Chapter 3] The Crazy Adventure Disclaimer: I Don't own the plot of the story. I Don't Own Journey to the Center of The Earth. I Just own Katie and Vanessa. We are finally are in the crystal and diamond covered cave and we are standing on Muskovite. What the hell is muskovite? Well, i'll tell you what it is? It's a very thin rock formation that can break easily based on the person's height and weight. Sean turned over to the cave walls encovered with Emeralds and pulls a few out. \"Hey guys! Looks like im getting me a new Ferrari!\" shouted Sean I walked over to Sean and snatched the diamond out of his hands. \"Im getting me a new sports car!\" I shouted \"Hey! I called the shots first!\" Sean complained nasailly Mom growled. \"Will you two quit fighting! \"Eh?\" I said Sean gave me that 'Are you retarded' look. Then he shook his head thinking that im an idiot. \" Who is she kidding? I know that she wants to be at that stupid party with her drunk friends and drink herself silly. Besides, who would care, like i would \" thought Sean The muskovite started to crack, Mom was squatting down on the muskovite as it was cracking. Trevor looked scared. \"Muskovite\" Trevor muttered \"What's Muskovite?\" asked Sean \"Muskovite is a very thin rock formation that can break easily based on the person's height and weight\" Mom explained. A crystal fell out of Sean's bag and dropped and cracked more of the muskovite. I cackled silently. Mom and Trevor sighed in relief. \"It's thicker than i thought\" remarked Trevor Their wrong. The muskovite broke and they fell.. About 100,000ft to be percise. And we screamed like little kindergarten girls. \"So, What do we do now?\" asked Trevor \"I dunno! How bout we find a way to get outta here, Theories anyone?!!\" asked Sean \"Probably, the fall will kill us all and we will land on some rock\" I replied \"Any other possible theories?!\" asked Sean \"It's possible that there is a water slide at the bottom and we will slide into some water\" I replied once again \"Cut the science crap, ENGLISH PLEASE!!!\" Mom shouted right in my face \"We'll all fall on a water slide and land in a ocean of water, Numnuts!\" I yelled right back \"Great, May i suggest that theres a 50/50 chance that we'll die, This is just a fucking nightmare. I didn't plan on dying at 13!!! Can we just peacefully.. FUCKING SCREAM TILL OUR LUNGS TURN BLUE!!!!\" suggested Sean \"I Don't kn—NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!\" Mom yelled Then we all screamed again like little girls and then we landed on the water slide and slid down as we screamed like little girls, Then we fell into the water. Me, Trevor and Sean were able to swin forward but Trevor realized he forgot Mom, Trevor gave the hi-sign for Me and Sean to go on and wait for them. Trevor grabbed Mom and they both swam. Meanwhile, Me and Sean has just reached shore at the center of the earth. Definetly Confusing, Eh? I Got up and looked confused. \"This is the center of the earth?\" I asked \"Yes\" Sean replied \"Isn't the center of the earth supposed to be lava and rocks?\" I asked again \"Yes\" Sean replied \"Why is it all look like the amazon?\" I asked once again \"What is this, 20 Questions?\" He asked me \"Sorry, I didn't realize that you hated repeat questions\" I said \"Nnnn I just hate it\" Sean pointed out I shrugged in agreement and walked forward and shook my head. \"Where the hell is Mom and Trevor?\" After i asked that question, The two appeared coughing up water. Sean turned to them and then turned to me. \"Does that answer your question?\" He asked. Then i turned over. \"Yes\" I replied \"Eh, I am NEVER going to swim again\" Mom complained \"Sheesh Mom, Who peed in your coffee?\" I wised off \"Trevor Did\" Mom replied in an angry voice Sean turned over to me again. \"Kat, Do you always wise off to your mom?\" He asked \"Yeah, 24/7. It's a everyday thing between me and Mom\" I replied calmly Sean laughed. \"No wonder your mom is in a bitchy mood\" I shrugged. \"So?\" I wised off at him Later, I seperated from the 3 and ran off by myself with my essentials. Unfourtunately, I lost my etch-a-sketch in the water slide. I was by the Venus FlyTraps until one of those rude traps used it's arm, wrapped it around my neck and started to choke me to death. \"HELP!!! HELP!!! HELP!!!\" I said in a scratchy tone. Sean heard my cry for help and came to me worried and beat the crap out of the trap and i was able to break free from it. Then Sean threw his fist into the trap's mouth and goo came out and was on his hand as well. \"Eww!\" he shreiked I smiled in gratitude. \"Thank You\" He smiled and kissed me on the cheek. \"Don't Mention It\" After that, My heart dropped and i mad dashed like hell, Lucky for me i got out my diary and recorded it in. Meanwhile, Mom and Trevor hit a snag by the rocks and they were both under a rock. Mom continued her bitching. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"137 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"138 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"139 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"140 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. Meanwhile, Sean made his way to a magnetic rorck field with his compass. His compass went all loopy. \"A Magnetic field\" he said to himself. Then he jumped onto the first rock as it floated and bumped two other rocks and they floated away. \"Damn!\" he muttered. The rock tipped over and he held on with all his might and his water bottle dropped. He gulped and looked scared. Meanwhile, back at the rock, Mom and Trevor were bitching at each other. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"141 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"142 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"143 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"144 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are a bitch?!\" asked Trevor \"37 times\" Mom bellowed in her annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are a bitch?!\" asked Trevor \"38 times\" Mom bellowed in her annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are a bitch?!\" asked Trevor \"39 times\" Mom bellowed in her annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are a bitch?!\" asked Trevor \"40 times!!\" Mom bellowed in her annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"145 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"146 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"147 times\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice. \"Did i mention that YOU are an idiot?!\" asked Mom \"148 times!!\" Trevor bellowed in his annoyed voice.

Im lost, my compassnis all screwed up and im NOT EVEN close to finding my way out of thisnhellhole!\" he yelled He walked up the field and all of ansudden.. Rocks came flying toward him, He dodged every rock that camenflying to him. Meanwhile, That stupid dinosaur wasnstill near me and i was still running like hell going away and inrealized that the ground is pure muskovite. I kept running until inheard it cracking and then, CRACK! The dinosaur perished and i wasnsafe. \"Wow!

IM NOT NO DAMN SEAnANIMAL!\" Mom screamed \"YOU BETTER TAKE THAT BACK!!\" Sean smiled. \"Early commentnretracted\" Finally, I Found those the threenlittle idiots and i approached them wearing my favourite shade ofnlipstick 'Kiss Me Charcoal'. \"What happened here?\" I asked \"Do you really wanna know?\" Momnasked \"As a matter of fact, i do wannanknow\" I replied curiously \"Sean the moron called your motherna sea animal\" said Trevor I slapped Sean across the head. \"Whatnis wrong with you?\" I asked \"Uh, No\" replied Sean \"First, Trevor tells me im fat,nThen he calls a fucking bitch and then says im a damn sea animal\"nMom explained in harsh tone. Wow! Sometimes, Mom can be on thenbitchy side. I get that from her. \"Why do you get to explain first?\"nasked Trevor \"Cause im NOT the one who gotnmyself into this mess\" Mom replied \"Oh Ho! My Fault?! If you hadn'tninsist on taking us to the mountain, We wouldn't be in this mess nownwould we?!\" asked Trevor \"Excuse Me! If Sean hadn't of foundnthat fucking Sisemic blip or whatever the hell that is.. Sontechnically, It's your fault.\" explained Mom I sighed in annoyance as i rubbed mynhead. \"Jesus Mary and Joseph! Stop your whining!\" Everyone finally stopped bickering.nMom sighed. \"Katie, Sweetie? Can you and Seannplease get us out from under the rock?\" Mom asked \"Sorry, We don't do heavy lifting\"nSean and I replied in unison Trevor looked angry. \"Sean!\" \"Sorry, Do this yourself\" \"KATIE!!!! SEAN!!!!\" \"SORRY!\" Mom and Trevor sighed in unison. Theynmade a quick glance and tried to get the rock off of them, Theynsucceeded. They sighed again. \"Finally\" muttered Trevor Mom sighed happily and smiled. \"Mynbutt is flat and my head is as big as a balloon\" Trevor giggled. \"Funny, Now lets gonget those freakin kids\" Mom smirked. \"You know me too well\" Mom and Trevor hopped off the groundnand went after Sean and I. Speaking of Sean, He was too constructingnthe raft to get to the gyser. An hour later, Were in the middle ofnthe ocean and it was storming like hell. \"Hey! I think i see something!\" Inshouted Trevor looked over at the ocean andnsaw some kind of fish swimming toward us. He made his usual comicngulp. \"Katie! Go faster!\" Katie went over to the kite andnleveled it higher, That didn't work. Katie held on the kite as i flewnoff. Mom looked scared. \"Katie!\" she yelled. \"Shit!\" muttered Sean[Chapter 6] ThenCrazy Adventure Disclaimer: I Don't own the plotnof the story. I Don't Own Journey to the Center of The Earth.nI Just own Katie and Vanessa. I forgot.. Story is told innKatie's POV. An Hour later, Sean and I were on thenother side sitting down, on the beach. \"Whats gonna happen to us?\" Inasked \"No Clue.\" replied Sean \"I'll leave home and move closer tonyou and get a job, maybe quit school and get my own place\" Inreplied softly \"What?!\" Sean outbursted loudly I panicked and gulped. Then i put onna teeny little smirk. \"Heh Heh\" Sean didn't look to happy about whatni said... Apparently, He was pissed and i knew for sure he was gonnanhave a heart attack and yell. \"Leave school?! Are you insane?!\"nHe asked me \"Uh..... No!\" I replied harshly \"Explain to me why quitting schoolnis the best option? Seriously, Explain to me?!\" dared Sean For that moment, I promised God, Momnand Sean that i would look after myself and frankly, I don't knownwhich one im scared of the most right now. I gulped and improvisednand see if he believed me. \"Well..\" I said nervously Ok, Scratch that! He didn't believenme. Instead, He's more pissed off than ever. \"Wrong Answer!\" He yelled I put on a smile to soften him up.nThat didn't work either. Sean was angry,frustrated and basically...nlost at that point. I didn't know what else to do. So i decided tontell him im NOT gonna leave so he can shut the hell up already. \"Fine! I won't leave school, But imnleaving home, getting my own and a job\" I proposed. Finally! He was happy. \"Good andnyou better not leave school or im gonna have to kill you\"nthreatened Sean I sighed and hugged him. Then wenwalked to the guyser with our belongings to only find lava and thenadults there. \"Get In!\" Mom yelled Sean and I hopped in the hardenedndinosaur head. Trevor reached over to his bag and digged around. Henhad 6 more burly flares left. He lit one of the flares and struck itnon the wall but the wall has water eroded on the other side. \"Trevor, I'll lower you down tondrier wall\" suggested Mom Mom grabbed rope and tied it aroundnhim and lowered him about 5 feet. He grabbed his next flare and litnit and struck it at the wall and lit. Then the wall exploded andnwater shot out, then we shot out and saw blue stuff on the top. \"Is that sky?\" asked Mom \"It is\" I replied Then we shot out of the volcano andnfell on the side and slid down the side and destroyed the home ofnsome Norwegian man. We all got out and stepped foot on sweet ground.nMom was excited and actually layed flat on the ground like she wasnhugging it. The norwegian man came and yelled at us.. In Norwegian!!!nI grabbed my bag of rubies and handed it to him and spoke innNorwegian. Are you surprised? I can speak Norwegian. He took thenrubies. \"You want to slide again he asked?\"nHe asked A few days later, Sean was moving innto his Uncle's house a few blocks from mine, We were finally togethernand we lived happily ever after.

I heard come from downstairs. \"Hver er það?\" I yelled. \"I'm sorry I don't speak Icelandic!\" A man's voice yelled back. I shrugged opening the door to reveal a slightly middle aged man and a boy more than likely my age-13. \"Uh...can I help you?\" I asked. \"Hi.\" The younger boy piped up. \"Hello.\" I said eyes darting between the two. \"Hi, I'm trev-proffessor Anderson and this is my nephew Sean. I'm looking for Sigurbjorn Ásgeirsson...\" Professor Anderson said. \"Uh…I'm sorry he's…well he's dead.\" I looked down. \"Dead?\" Sean asked. \"Yes. As in not living.\" I answered. \"I got that…\" He muttered. \"Olivia? Olivia Hver er það?\" Hannah came around to the door. \"They were looking for Sigurbjorn.\" I answered sadly. \"Um, this is Hannah.\" I said. \"Hi I'm Proffesor Anderson and this is my nephew Sean we're from America and...well do you run the institute?\" Proffesor Anderson asked. I frowned...there wasn't an institute. At least not anymore... \"No. There is no institute.\" Hannah answered. \"But the sign out front-\" Prof. Anderson pointed behind him. \"It failed.\" Hannah cut him off...yeah big time. \"Oh. Did you work for him?\" Prof. Anderson asked. \"No. I'm his daughter. And this is my god-daughter Olivia.\" Hannah said. \"Would you like to come in?\" I offered. \"Yes!\" Sean exclaimed rubbing his arms. What a baby it wasn't that cold. \"Coffee? Hot chocolate?\" I asked. \"Hot chocolate sounds awesome thanks.\" Sean answered stepping inside following me to the living room Prof. Anderson and Hannah behind us. \"Water's just fine thank you.\" He said. I nodded getting the drinks. I threw a blanket at Sean too rolling my eyes. \"Thanks.\" He said shivering. \"Here, Proffessor.\" Hannah said handing him the water. \"Oh um you can call me Trevor.\" He said. \"So why are you looking for a dead man at this time of night?\" Hannah asked. \"This.\" Trevor said digging in his leather satchel to pull out The book Journey to the center of the earth. \"Yes we know it. What about it?\" I asked. \"This belonged to my brother Max. He has notes all over the place in here and your father's name is in some of them.\" Trevor explained to Hannah. \"We think he may have been in contact with him about something-I don't quite know what but something important.\" Trevor finished. I nodded, \"So your brother was a vernian then?\" I asked. \"No...he was an explorer of sorts.\" Trevor said. \"What's a vernian?\" Sean asked drinking his hot chocolate. \"A vernian is a person who believes that the writtings of Jules Verne was scientific fact.\" Hannah answered. \"The guy was a science fiction writer. Yet, some people thought that his writings were real and set out to find 'the center of the earth,' my father was the biggest vernian of them all. He based his life work on that book.\" Trevor scowled, \"My brother was no vernian.\" He said. Walking over to the shelf I got our book and put it on the table next to the copy that once belonged to Max Anderson. \"Flip through it.\" I shrugged. He flipped both books to the same page, and I noticed the same doodles scrawled on the sides. \"See. That's probably how your brother knew him. He was definitely a vernian.\" Hannah said. Sean grimaced, \"My dad was kind of….out there.\" He said. I nodded, \"Most vernians are.\" I said. Trevor glared at us, \"Don't say that. You didn't know him like I did.\" He snapped. \"From the looks of it you didn't seem to know him as well as you thought you did either.\" Hannah said looking through the notes. Hannah sighed, \"What are you two doing here?\" \"I'm a scientist,\" insisted Trevor with raised eyebrows. \"And a professor. There is some seismic activity going on around here and we thought we should check it out.\" \"With him?\" I frowned pointing at Sean. Trevor shrugged and Sean looked up from his hot chocolate. \"There aren't any roads north of here how do you expect to get there?\" Hannah asked. \"Um…\" Trevor looked stumped. \"I'm a mountain guide. I could take you there.\" Hannah offered. \"Sounds great.\" Sean spoke up. I looked at him and nodded, \"Great.\" Hannah frowned at me. \"What do you mean?\" She asked. \"I mean it sounds fun.\" I smiled. \"I don't think it's a great idea for you to come.\" She said. \"Oh, come on Hannah it's just hiking.\" I whined. \"Alright…\" Although she still didn't sound sure. \"Then it'll be five thousand.\" Hannah told Trevor. I raised my eyebrows, steep. \"A day? That seems reasonable.\" Trevor said. I giggled and Sean gave me a weird look. \"An hour.\" Hannah said in offended tone. Trevor looked about ready to sprint out of the house but Sean intervened, \"Do you accept rolls of quarters?\" He asked. I giggled again, this would be interesting.[Chapter 2] 2 Disclaimer except Olvia \"Come on ladies let's go!\" I yelled back laughing at the two men on the rocks below us. \"Olivia.\" Hannah frowned but she smiled trying to stifle her laugh. \"They're being slow pokes.\" I grinned, \"Motivation.\" She laughed and shook her head, \"Ha-ha!\" Sean called up sarcastically. \"Mount Sneffles?\" We heard Sean ask getting closer. \"Why don't you explain professor?\" Hannah said. \"Mount Sneffles was the mountain that the fictional character in the book found the portal to the center of the earth.\" Trevor explained to Sean. I nodded. \"Finally!\" I yelled pointing to the small metal object close to us. Trevor ran over to the object placing his hands around it. \"We came all the way up here for that?\" I asked. \"It's worth so much more than it looks.\" Trevor said getting a tighter grip on it and pulling. \"Ookay then.\" I shrugged. \"Uh…Trevor…you might want to hurry it up.\" Hannah said and I noticed that she now saw the gray clouds moving towards us. \"Olivia come on.\" Hannah murmured. \"I am sorry! But there is no time to-!\" Hannah yelled as she, Sean and I ran to the nearby cave. I gasped and pulled Sean out of the way of lightning pulling us down to the ground. \"Thanks!\" Sean yelled once we were in the cave. \"No problem.\" I said brushing myself off. \"Trevor! Drop it!\" Sean yelled. \"That thing's attracted to lightning Trevor!\" I yelled as he ran towards the cave with it dodging lighting bolts. He soon dropped it and rocks and dust fell all over. I screamed diving out of the way of some rocks and felt myself fall to the ground dust all around us. I coughed and looked up to see Sean on top of me. \"Olivia?\" Hannah yelled. \"Over here! I'm fine.\" I said. \"Thanks.\" I said as he got up. \"Even Steven right?\" Sean said extending a hand. \"Yeah.\" I nodded laughing a bit. Sean turned to the entrance, \"Oh, no. Guys! Come, on! You gotta help me dig! What are you standing there for!\" Sean yelled to us. \"Sean stop.\" I said. \"It'd take us at least a month to dig our way out. There's no point.\" Trevor sighed stopping. Sean started taking deep breaths and more and more. \"Sean. Sean we'll be fine.\" I said. \"I'll get you out of here I promise.\" Trevor promised. \"What do you have in there?\" He asked Hannah. \"Rope, flash lights, protein bars, signal flares, blanket and some first aide supplies.\" She replied. \"We'll have to ration the food it won't last more than a week.\" I said. \"We don't know how long we'll be trapped down here for.\" Hannah said. \"Trapped? Trapped?\" Sean yelled. \"Oh, my God check your phones! I'm not getting any service!\" He yelled. \"We won't get any service down here Sean.\" I supplied. He groaned. \"So…who's taking the lead?\" I asked. \"I will.\" Trevor said starting to go off Sean next then me then Hannah. \"My gut says…right.\" Trevor said. \"My gut says left.\" I spoke up. \"My gut says we're doomed.\" Sean said. I smiled, \"Ok then right it is.\" I screamed and pushed Sean out of the way grabbing the back of Trevor's jacket saving him from falling down the abyss below. \"This isn't your lab professor!\" Hannah exclaimed. \"This is life here.\" She said, \"Meaning, be careful!\" I yelled. \"What does this say?\" He asked me handing me a rusty old sign. \"Uh…halda ut.\" I said. \"Keep out.\" I translated. \"That's good.\" Hannah said. \"Good? More like good advice.\" Sean mumbled. \"Oh, come on. It couldn't be that deep.\" I said giving him a punch to the shoulder. \"I can't see the bottom.\" Sean said, \"Conclusion; it's too deep for me.\" He finished. I smiled a bit laughing a little. \"Sean use your watch time this when I drop it to see how long it takes until it hits the bottom. Count out loud.\" He lit the flare and dropped it. I shrieked as the oncoming explosion knocked me on top of Sean and we tumbled to the ground. \"Now that was just mean.\" Sean said looking at me. \"Fine. I'm sorry.\" I mocked making him grin in return. \"What was that?\" Hannah asked. \"Magnesium.\" Trevor answered. \"Magnesium…kind of flammable isn't it professor?\" Hannah smiled grimly. \"Yeah. It's used in gunpowder and match sticks.\" He answered. \"Then maybe flares aren't a great idea.\" I mused as he pulled out an orange glow stick. \"Same principal got it?\" Trevor asked. Sean rolled his eyes; it wasn't like he was two. \"One, two, three.\" Sean counted. \"Almost three.\" Sean shrugged. \"Two hundred feet?\" I checked. \"Yeah.\" Trevor answered surprised I knew that calculation. \"That's like a really big building right?\" Sean asked fear in his-well everything. \"Yup, 20 story high rise.\" Trevor smirked with a chuckle. \"I have rope.\" Hannah said. I eyed her bag warily; I just wanted to live! \"Enough?\" Trevor asked. I scoffed, and Hannah looked pointedly at him, \"I always have enough rope.\" I laughed however Sean looked at us like we were insane. \"You mean you're suggesting we go down there?\" Sean exclaimed. \"We're repelling down.\" Trevor nodded helping Hannah with the rope. \"Down into that deep dark hole?\" Sean checked eyes wide at Trevor. \"Is that a problem?\" Trevor smirked. \"Pft,\" Sean snorted looking at me. \"Are you kidding me I've got…uh…got…\" Sean looked from me to the abyss below. \"Uh….there's no way I'm going down there.\" Sean shook his head looking back at his uncle. \"You're man enough to call dibs on the mountain guide, but not man enough to go down in that dark hole?\" Trevor said smugly I burst out laughing as Hannah raised her eyebrows at the two, \"No one calls dibs on the mountain guide.\" She said. Each of them blushed a bit, and I laughed again. \"So, who's first?\"[Chapter 3] 3 Disclaimer except Olvia Trevor volunteered first then Sean then me then Hannah. \"Ready Sean?\" I asked lowering him a little so he could still see Hannah and me though. \"Remind me, Olivia, why are we doing this again?\" He asked. I laughed, \"You're funny. I'll remember you as you were.\" I teased. \"Olivia, don't scare him.\" Hannah scolded. I shrugged grinning, and Sean said, \"I'm not scared!\" I turned to him and Hannah said, \"So I can start repelling Olivia then?\" Hannah asked. \"Heck no!\" Sean cried eyes wide with fear and I couldn't help but laugh a little again. \"Are you guys coming or what? It's pretty cool down here!\" He yelled. I frowned, \"Woo.\" I said sarcastically rolling my eyes. Sean audibly swallowed as Trevor said, \" Way down here!\" He yelled. I rolled my eyes, \"Ok, ok Trev I think we got him he looks ready to pee his pants!\" I yelled laughing a little. \"You know if I didn't want to live by keeping my death grip on this rope you'd be dead meat.\" He said through grit teeth. \"Ooh, I'm scared now. Go!\" I yelled mockingly. \"Alright love birds I'm gonna lower Sean slowly, keep calm and a tight grip with careful footing.\" Hannah reminded him. \"And whatever you do don't-\" \"Don't Olivia.\" Hannah warned as I tried to warn him not to look down, \"If you remind him you know he will.\" She said. \"Exactly.\" I grinned as she started to lower him, \"What? Don't what? I want to liiiiive!\" he exclaimed as we lowered him and I got my rope set up giggling to myself. \"Sean lean back like Olivia. Remember we're all connected nothing can happen.\" Hannah warned him. \"Right…\" He mumbled. \"Like I trust you and what you're doing.\" He muttered to me. \"Hey! When it comes to my life I'm safe as can be.\" I smirked. \"Unlike you, seriously lean back!\" I said sharply and he did as told. Suddenly he kicked the walls and caused rocks to bounce off the walls and fall on Trevor's head. \"Hey!\" He yelled at his nephew. \"Okay you look really scared. I'll help you. Just talk to me.\" I shrugged. \"Uh…ok…so Olivia…you come here often?\" He asked. I smiled and heard his uncle, \"Is that the best you could come up with?\" Trevor remarked with a laugh. \"I'm making conversation with her!\" Sean growled heatedly. I smiled, \"No, Sean. I do not come here often.\" I smiled a little. \"That's comforting.\" He mumbled. Suddenly Trevor became intrigued with the rock, \"Hey! Guys this is schist!\" He yelled. \"What?\" Sean yelled. \"It's a metamorphic rock... Green schist, garnet schist, mica-garnet schist.\" \"Oh, schist,\" Sean looked hard at the rock as well. \"I learned about it in one of my science classes at school.\" He explained. I nodded, \"Was it interesting?\" I asked. \"Not in the least.\" He shook his head, making me laugh again. \"Look at it-\" Trevor went to reach over to look grab at a piece of rock, however he lost his footing. With a scream his rope pulled out and tangled around Hannah's causing her to loose her grip. Soon we were all screaming and loosing our footing. Luckily Sean, Hannah, and I were able to regain their grip on the wall however Trevor was left to hang over the abyss of darkness. \"Trevor I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to cut you loose you're tied onto my rope and you'll bring us all down if I don't.\" Hannah said bringing out her pocket knife. \"Hannah no!\" Sean yelled. I looked away afraid to see him fall. \"Don't, don't, don't!\" Trevor screamed. A moment later I heard, \"Oof.\" Along with a thud. I winced looking down to see Trevor lying on what was the bottom. \"Hey guys I think I found the bottom.\" He winced in pain. I hit the ground next but I landed on my feet. \"Nice work.\" I complimented with a smirk at Trevor on the ground. \"Karma for making fun of me. The rest of you….be warned.\" Sean pointed at Hannah and I and I shook my head. \"You actually did alright for a first timer.\" I shrugged. He glared, \"Never speak of it again.\" He said. \"Alright, alright.\" I put my hands up in defeat. \"Is that…a mining tunnel?\" I asked Hannah. She frowned, \"\"Old Bla'gils Mine... it was shut down after a big disaster over sixty years ago,\" Hannah inputted as they walked closer to the tunnel. \"How big?\" Sean bit his lip nervously. \"Eighty-one dead.\" I supplied. \"That's big.\" Trevor said following Hannah in. I looked at Sean, \"Ladies first,\" He gestured. \"Age before beauty,\" I smirked. \"Yeah, so um…go!\" He said. \"Fine we'll mix it up.\" I stuck my tongue out at him going in carefully and saw Hannah playing with the generator to the mine. \"Hannah! It could blow up stop touching it!\" Trevor yelled as Sean walked in. \"That's it I'm out.\" Sean said turning back around; however I grabbed his backpack before he could get out. \"Oh, no. You're gonna risk your life with us whether you like it or not.\" I said. \"Fine, mom.\" He said sarcastically. \"Just shut up.\" I snapped not wanting to talk about parents. I guess he did know how I feel…but not completely. He still has his mom, I don't have my dad. Not that I want him anyways…long story there…Suddenly the lights went on in the mine and Hannah smirked at Trevor. \"Okay I take it back touch whatever!\" He said grinning looking at the addition of lights. \"Hey! Hey, guys this is our way out right? I mean they had to get their tools somehow.\" Sean pointed to the track. I shrugged. \"Hey Hannah how many got out in the explosion?\" Trevor asked. \"One.\" She shrugged. I heard him swallow nervously clearing his throat. \"Well that's a start. I call front.\" Sean said hopping in the front car. I laughed again less tense now. \"Ok, me too!\" I said sliding in smoothly. \"Get out of there. We don't even know if they work.\" Trevor rolled his eyes. \"Apparently they do.\" Hannah pointed to the push cart. \"Well we don't know if they're safe.\" Trevor protested. \"What do you propose we do? Die now and have a chance or starve later in the abyss pit for sure?\" I said from the front. He sighed, \"Get in.\" Hannah grinned as he got in the second cart and she pushed us ahead on the track. Suddenly a whirl of speed hit our carts and we all screamed as we raced down the track. \"Why doesn't this thing have seatbelts?\" Sean yelled. \"You're worried about seatbelts?\" Trevor yelled almost amusedly. I gasped as I almost tipped our cart and Sean claimed a death grip on my torso as I screamed. \"Olivia! Be careful!\" Hannah yelled. \"You too!\" I shrieked seeing her on the push cart that had no walls what so ever. I gasped as Sean yelled pointing, \"Hannah!\" He pointed to a gap in the tracks up ahead. \"I know…\" She murmured. \"Pull the brakes!\" Trevor yelled. \"No!\" I screamed pulling Sean's hand away from them. \"She's right, if we stop now we'll never make it.\" Hannah yelled. I buried my head in Sean's shoulder as we approached. \"I can't look!\" I yelled. I screamed as the feeling of being airborne over took us. Suddenly I felt a thud and looked up when I heard, \"Uh…Olivia. We're safe…at least we are…I don't know where they went…whoa!\" We yelled as we came upon a sharp turn. I looked behind us and saw that they were gone. \"They had to have lead to the same thing…this is kind of fun now.\" I smiled a bit. \"Yeah…whoa!\" We yelled as the cart raced down the tracks. \"Wooo!\" We yelled. \"Yeah!\" I exclaimed as we slowed to a stop at the end a few feet before the wall. \"That. Was awesome!\" Sean yelled high-fiving me. \"Totally!\" I exclaimed. \"What happened to you guys?\" He looked at Hannah on top of his uncle on the track getting up. \"Don't ask.\" Trevor answered. \"Hey look!\" Sean cried. I followed him to where he pointed. \"What do you think this is?\" He asked as we went in we heard his uncle, \"Don't go in there…never mind.\" He sighed. \"Whoa…rubies.\" He said pointing to the red rock. \"Emeralds.\" Hannah said coming in. A moment later I gasped pointing, \"Diamonds.\" Sean immediately attacked them grabbing plenty handing me some. I stuck them in my back pack and he stuffed his in as I zipped mine up. \"When I get outta here I'm getting a mazzerati…\" Sean grinned. I smiled, \"Nice. I'm thinking collage.\" I smiled. \"Money isn't all that matters Sean people matter too…\" Trevor said distantly eyeing the rocks. \"I think.\" He shrugged grabbing a chunk. \"How about we leave now?\" I asked done with the rocks. Sean tried to reach for a higher one and I heard a distant crack. I gasped , crack . We all fell silent, except Trevor who said, \"Nobody move.\" We all obeyed not wanting to die. \"Muscovite.\" \"No,\" Hannah glanced down. \"Muscovite...\" I groaned. \"Muscovite? What's that?\" Sean asked. \"It's really, really thin rock formation.\" I said. \"How thin?\" He asked. \"That the slightest movement or change in weight or pressure can break it.\" Trevor said. I swallowed nervously nodding. \"And we happen to be standing on a lot of it.\" He finished. \"We're all going to walk back the same way we came; as slowly as possible.\" Trevor said eyeing the ground carefully. We all started to move slowly around the rock and I could only get the cry to escape my lips before it happened, \"Sean!\" I yelled and the diamond fell out of his backpack hitting smack dab on the muscovite. All was silent for a moment, \"It's actually thicker than I thought,\" Trevor smiled. Crack.[Chapter 4] 4 Disclaimer except Olvia \"AHHHHHHHH!\" We all screamed as we fell. Everything was silent for a moment as we fell, \"WE'RE STILL FALLING!\" Trevor yelled. We all screamed once more grabbing onto one another and Sean spoke up, \"TREVOR WHAT'S AT THE BOTTOM?\" He yelled. \"IF VERNE WAS RIGHT THIS COULD GO ON FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES!\" \"VERNE WAS NOT RIGHT!\" Hannah shrieked. \"TREVOR WHAT'S AT THE BOTTOM?\" I screamed. \"MOST LIKELY IT JUST ENDS!\" He called back. \"ENDS? ANY OTHER THEORIES?\" Sean shouted. \"WELL, THE WALLS OF THIS TUNNEL COULD HAVE ERODED WITH WATER WHICH STILL RUNS PROVIDING A GRADUAL BREAK THROUGH OUR FALL… KIND OF LIKE A WATER SLIDE.\" Trevor yelled. I nodded, \"WATER SLIDES ARE GOOD!\" I yelled. \"BUT TREVOR…THE WATER COULD HAVE FORMED STALAGMITES AT THE BOTTOM…WE COULD BE SKEWERED!\" Hannah yelled as we kept falling to our deaths. I screamed in fear taking a death grip on Sean's arm. \"OW!\" He yelled. \"THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE!\" Trevor yelled. We screamed again and I started to chant with Sean, \"Water slide, water slide,\" as we fell into a lake of water. I tried to push my way to the top but I couldn't go! I was running out of oxygen so I began to blow bubbles and noticed through the blurry vision from the water the ankle of my pants was caught on a stalagmite. I fumbled to get it free and suddenly a hand ripped the fabric off and pulled my limp body to the surface where I gasped for air coughing trying to get the water out from my lungs. \"Th-thanks.\" I coughed as I saw Sean had grabbed me, \"Anytime.\" He nodded. I smiled, \"I just hope that's the last time we fall.\" \"Is it just me or is the ceiling looking like it's moving?\" Sean inquired. \"I think they're stars…\" Hannah mumbled. \"No it's definitely moving.\" Trevor muttered. I frowned, \"Butterflies?\" I asked. \"No…I think they're birds.\" Trevor answered. \"Electric birds?\" Sean asked. \"They look like Syannas Rozoptrex. The bio-luminescent. They're like fire flies or glowworms. It's incredible.\" The rest of the flock flew away except for one, which stayed near Sean and me. \"Whoa…\" I whispered. \"Have you seen these before?\" I asked Trevor. \"Just in the museum where they were fossilized-they've been extinct for over a hundred fifty million years.\" He said. I stumbled to follow the flock as they came back, \"Olivia don't follow them it could be something more dangerous than the muscovite!\" Hannah yelled as the rest of us went into enormous cave with big rays of light shining down. There was a beautiful water fall and the glow birds swarmed around it. Around the water fall there was large rock which we stood on. \"Ladies and gentleman, I give you the center of the earth,\" Trevor murmured as we all stared in amazement. \"Max was right! He was right! Max was RIGHT!\" He yelled in triumph. \"Hannah…your dad was right too.\" Sean said. \"Wow…look at this place! Talk about a vacation!\" I yelled. \"They believed something that everyone told them was impossible. HE WAS RIGHT!\" Trevor shouted. \"Sean… you're dad was right too.\" I grinned and he returned the grin. \"What's that light up there?\" Sean asked. \"I can't tell. It must be some sort of luminescent gas combination…?\" \"It's like a… terrarium.\" I said frowning. \"Yeah a terrarium just under the crust of the earth. A world within the world.\" Trevor agreed. \"It's exactly the same thing Lyden Brock wrote.\" He said after reading the description in the book. \"Are you saying that Lyden Brock, the character, was real?\" Hannah asked in skeptically. \"Someone came down here, someone saw all this, someone got out and told Verne,\" Trevor shrugged. I nodded in agreement. \"Someone got out?\" Sean repeated, \"That's the best thing I've heard all day!\" Sean yelled throwing his arms around me. \"Ok, happy moment up.\" I said laughing as he let go of me grinning. \"This is insane…\" I said blowing on a huge dandelion getting it all over Sean. \"Oh, ew get it off!\" Sean yelled. Trevor laughed with me as we moved onto seeing giant mushrooms. \"Enormous fossilized mushrooms.\" Trevor said. \"Does this mean everything in the book is real?\" Hannah asked. \"Probably.\" Trevor shrugged mindlessly. \"Like…the dangerous parts too?\" I asked. \"I was just thinking about that too…\" Trevor mumbled. \"Oh, great.\" I nodded. \"Whoa…Olivia come quick.\" Sean said. He led me to a huge twisted tree, \"What is it?\" I asked. \"I don't know but I'm going in.\" He said climbing up, \"Wait up!\" I called. \"Hannah, Trevor over here!\" I yelled. After a little exploring in the tree-house I heard Hannah yell, \"Trevor!\" from outside. A while later we walked down to the beach with Hannah where I saw big pile of rocks on the sand and Trevor watching the waves sadly. \"I'm so sorry, Sean.\" Hannah said leading us down to the beach. Trevor laid a hand on Sean's shoulder and I gave his hand a gentle squeeze apologetically; I knew how he felt loosing a parent. \"I never even got the chance to know him.\" Sean's voice cracked and I saw a few tears fall to his cheeks. \"I mean…I wish I did though.\" He said. \"He wrote something, and I want you to hear it,\" Trevor said, pulling out a little journal. I bit back tears myself, remembering my mom's note from nine years ago. \"August fourteen, 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday. Six weeks ago I promised myself I would be home to give him his first baseball glove. Now I'm worried that I'll never get the chance. I set out to make an incredible discovery to share here with Trevor and the world, but now, I would trade it all just to watch you grow up, to be the brave and certain man I know you will become. Happy birthday, Sean. I love you, Daddy.\" Trevor read and I saw a few more tears from both of them. \"Goodbye Max.\" Trevor whispered his voice shaking a bit as Sean cried into his jacket. I cried a little too. We walked back slowly to the tree house and Sean and I fell into the hammock to lay down for a bit. \"According to Max's journal we're here. Surrounded by lava-\" \"Wonderful.\" I muttered. \"During periods of intense seismic activity.\" Trevor finished. There was a rumble and a shake. \"The magma that surrounds us turns into like a big oven.\" \"Is that what happened to my dad?\" Sean asked, sitting up in the hammock. He got out and walked over to the table. \"I know we're still kids but Liv and I can handle this.\" Sean said. I looked up noticing the new nickname. \"Right?\" He asked turning to me. I sat up and nodded. \"Guys. Max was planning an escape. Look.\" Trevor said. \"His notes said that temperatures down here can reach up to about 200 degrees.\" Hannah said looking over Trevor's shoulder. \"200?\" I asked eyes wide. \"Human's can only stand up to 135 before death.\" I said nervously. \"It's already 95 degrees.\" Sean pointed at the thermometer. \"It was 82 when we first got here. The temperature is rising fast.\" Trevor said concerned. \"Then what do we do?\" Sean asked. \"I say we follow Max's plan.\" Trevor answered. \"Here's what he wrote: my analysis of the original Verne text leads me to believe that across the ocean due north my current position is a geyser- like river which might lead me back up to the surface,\" Hannah said as she showed us the notebook. \"So we just have to get across the ocean, find the geyser and just hitch ride topside?\" Sean asked. I nodded, \"Topside sounds good to me.\" I said. \"It's a little trickier than that – it could get so hot down here that all the water could just evaporate,\" Trevor corrected. \"How much time do we have?\" Sean asked. \"Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two tops.\" Rumble, shudder. \"Probably less,\" He added. \"Okay so the question is: what the fastest way to get across the ocean?\" Hannah asked. They discussed options, and then scratched them again. Sean and I glanced at each other. Then he picked up the book and laid it out for everyone to see. \"It's all in the book.\"[Chapter 5] 5 Disclaimer except Olvia It had been getting hotter and hotter every hour, and now I had cut my hiking pants into shorts, and my legs had been getting tanner. I sighed as I tied on another branch to the raft. We finally tied on the last couple branches to our raft and we turned to Trevor who offered up the food he scavenged for. We grimaced at the look but decided to try it, \"Uh-mm…ew.\" I swallowed. I kept eating it though even if it was one of the grossest things I had ever tasted. \"Seconds?\" Trevor teased. \"You're so lucky it's too hot to kill you right now.\" Sean warned. I smiled and nodded, \"I agree. You seriously couldn't have found berries or something?\" I asked. \"Nope. They were all dead.\" He answered chucking the rest of the disgusting substance into the ocean. \"Don't we need to set our mast?\" Sean asked his uncle a while later as we tied last minute knots. \"Nope. Don't need it.\" \"What?\" I asked, confused. \"The wind that we want is way up there,\" Trevor replied, pointing to the sky. \"Thermal. It's a lot faster than what we got down here.\" Sean and I then cut a few loose ends. Soon we had the sail tied on and it shot up as the wind violently took it into the air pulling all four of us into the water. \"It's just a little storm, isn't a big deal!\" Trevor yelled in assurance as the waves chopped, sea water spraying everywhere. It was pouring down rain and the sky was a blackish purple color with the frequent exception of fork- shaped lightening which flashed through the sky, brightening it all up for half a second. The thunder rumbled on and on like a thousand slamming doors. Hannah moved toward the side of the boat, drenched by the freezing rain. I took this chance to catch some rain in my mouth to quench my thirst and grabbed a piece of plastic from my backpack and Sean and I used it as a makeshift umbrella. \"There's something moving down there!\" \"Probably just plankton! Same thing we saw back at the beach!\" Trevor replied in a bellow. Sean leaned over one side. \"I don't know it looks kinda big for plankton!\" \"Sean, we're not at Sea World, so just back up a little!\" ordered Trevor. \"I think it's some sort of fish!\" yelled Sean, shaking out his hair. He suddenly jumped back. I screamed seeing the fish for the first time; it was hardly a fish. It was more like a humungous silvery giant with translucent eyes and knives for teeth. \"Sean get away from the water!\" I screamed. I gasped seeing at least 70 jump out of the water and go back under. \"They're everywhere!\" Sean yelled. \"Sean I told you we'd get to the batting cage!\" Trevor shouted back, pulling out two large sticks. They then whacked every fish that leapt out at us, smashing them right out to sea. \"Trevor look out!\" I yelled and he swatted at the fish. Sean smacked one and I smiled, \"Right in the gills! I'd say that's a home run.\" I smirked and he laughed swinging at a few more. I heard a beeping noise and Sean pulled his phone out of his pocket. \"Hello? Mom? Mom I can't hear you…uh…Uncle Trevor and I are sort of on a fishing trip…\" he said. I giggled, \"Extreme fishing.\" I murmured and he cracked a smile. \"And uh…uh…um…\" His glance fell on Hannah's butt. I glared but then saw the fish he saw. \"Hannah!\" I yelled as Trevor smashed the sucker out at sea. \"Uh…Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one and uh…\" Sean continued. Suddenly a huge fish came out of no where and took Sean's phone out to sea. \"My phone!\" He yelled as I laughed then I cried out, \"Sean behind you!\" I yelled. \"I got-ahhhhh!\" He screamed as the massive fish snake came out of the water we backed up on the raft. It bit at Sean's legs and I pulled him away towards Trevor and me. Wait a minute-it bit at the fish! Suddenly more snakes came out of the water, \"Look they want the fish not us!\" Trevor yelled. \"Sean, Olivia you take the tailor, we'll take the front. Hannah, hold the slack!\" He bellowed. Sean and I went to the back while the two adults were at the front. \"Olivia, Sean move the tailor to port side!\" He yelled. \"What?\" We said together. \"THAT WAY!\" We turned the rudder, and we started going left. \"Now, Hannah, just let it out gently, gently.\" He said to Hannah, who held the rope. \"It's working!\" I shouted, grinning. \"You're the man, uncle Trev!\" \"That's what I've been trying to tell the scientific community for years!\" Sean and I laughed but then quickly stopped as the sail was jerked forward. Hannah suddenly fell back. \"Hannah!\" Trevor yelled, coming to the back of the boat where Hannah landed. I winced seeing her bleeding hands from the rope burn. \"Sean no!\" I yelled as he started to fly off the boat with the sail I grabbed the other rope trying to catch him only to fly off with him. \"OLIVIA!\" Hannah screamed followed by Trevor, \"SEAN!\" We screamed, and heard Trevor before we flew off, \"DON'T LET GO!\" I rolled my eyes, \"No duh.\"[Chapter 6] 6 Disclaimer except Olvia I'd just woken up and immediately remembered our situation. I started to get up, but then gasped and fell back down. I looked at my throbbing shoulder. On my shoulder was a huge gash with blood trickling out of it. How'd that happen? I'd been unconscious for who knows how long. I crawled around in the sand. \"Sean?\" I yelled again. \"Sean?\" I yelled out once again. I slowly searched the beach still fazed from the previous night's events. Soon I went into the rain forest-like area behind the shore. I walked around, looking for nothing in particular. Suddenly I tripped over a massive tree root. I cried out in pain as I fell onto my shoulder getting blood on the pavement. I breathed deeply, shut my eyes and tried to gain my breath back. I was winded. It was a terrifying feeling, not being able to breathe. Eventually I regained oxygen but didn't bother getting up. My shoulder hurt too much. The forest floor was a little muddy but was covered with leaves. Fresh dew drops hung off the trees and dropped gently onto my face every now and then. I just lay on the ground, moaning with my eyes shut. \"Liv?\" I heard. Sean! \"Liv is that you?\" I heard him call. \"Sean! Over here!\" I yelled. \"I'm coming!\" He yelled. Soon Sean appeared before me dirty and sweat drenched, he grinned at me on the ground until he saw my shoulder, \"What happened?\" He asked. \"Nothing.\" I tried to shrug. \"Oh, so miss graceful isn't so graceful?\" He teased. \"I don't know how it happened.\" I confessed. \"It was there when I woke up. Are you okay?\" I asked as he helped me up. \"Here.\" He said ripping the sleeves off his shirt and tying them around my shoulder. \"Thanks. But you do know I could've used my shirt.\" I said. \"I was getting hot anyways.\" He shrugged. \"Yeah…it must be 110 degrees in here by now.\" I said trying to fan myself with my hand as we walked. \"South.\" Sean read off his compass. \"That's good the river's North.\" He said. \"So can I ask you something?\" Sean asked as we walked. \"Sure. Anything.\" I said. \"I've kind of been wondering…why are you living with your godmother?\" He asked. I cleared my throat awkwardly, \"Well…um…I was four years old when my mother k-killed her um herself.\" I said. \"And um so my dad turned to gambling and alcoholism and so now he's in jail for the money he owes.\" I winced as my shoulder finally went numb from the tightness of the makeshift bandage. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" Sean said. \"No it's…well it's good I don't have to live with my dad anymore. I moved in with Hannah probably seven years ago from my house with my dad in London.\" I said. \"I've really liked living with Hannah though.\" I said smiling. He smiled back and took my hand…his felt kind of sweaty I blushed a little feeling my hand grow hot too. I gasped as we tripped and fell. His pocket knife began to float. \"Whoa…that's cool.\" I said. \"Anti-gravity?\" Sean asked. \"No…then we'd be floating…it's some sort of magnetic field…magnetic rocks I think.\" I said looking at the rocks below us. Suddenly a stone disappeared from underneath him. \"Yup…magnetic rocks.\" He said looking ahead at the path of floating rocks we'd have to go across to get to the other side. \"Um…maybe we should go back. There might be another way.\" I said paling. \"No, this is the only way to get to the river. It'll be okay.\" He said. I swallowed, \"Go on without me. I'll be ok.\" I said. \"No. There's no way I'm leaving you here. Come on!\" He yelled tugging me to the rocks. I screamed as we raced over to the rocks of death. \"I'll go first then you get on the rock and we'll keep going.\" He said nervously starting to move towards the rock. I tugged on his hand. \"Um, just in case…I uh…\" I felt myself turn from sheet white to rose pink. I leaned in and kissed his cheek. \"Go.\" I whispered giving his hand a squeeze. He stood for a moment dumbfounded with a small smile and jumped over to the rocks. I winced and followed shortly after. \"Whoa! Sean watch out!\" I yelled as the rock began to move I moved onto Sean piggy back style. \"Ok, I guess I'll carry you across.\" He said. I nodded taking a death grip on him. He crawled onto the next rock with ease; soon we were a little over half-way across my heart pounding. We-well he-gripped the next rock on his hands and knees and I let out a scream as the rock did a 360 degree flip. \"It's ok hold on!\" Sean cried as I felt my breathing quicken. \"Yes.\" He whispered as it stopped. \"No!\" he groaned as it flipped forward. \"Wait. Sean we can flip to the other side.\" I said as we got closer. \"Good idea.\" Sean said trying to help us flip. I whimpered a bit my hands somehow getting an even tighter grip on him. We quickly got off before it could flip again. I got off him and laughed hysterically and he soon joined in. He turned his head mid laugh and cut me off by kissing me on the lips which I heartily returned. Once he took his lips off mine I laughed quietly a little. \"I really like you.\" I whispered. \"I really like you too.\" He whispered back making me smile and my head fell into his shoulder. We walked on and on and I called out, \"Trevor?\" He took my hand and called out as well, \"Hannah?\" I shrieked a little as I noticed the dinosaur skull under the mounds of dirt. Sean didn't even finch. He sighed as we walked on, \"What?\" I asked. \"Man I wish I read that book.\"[Chapter 7] 7 Disclaimer except Olvia \"Sean.\" I whispered grabbing his arm. \"What?\" He said. \"Get down!\" I yelled pushing us so we dove behind the skull. \"Olivia what are you-?\" I slammed my hand over his mouth. \"Shh!\" I hissed. \"Don't move and don't make a sound.\" I whispered as quiet as possible. He nodded and I kept my hand there. Our breathing became slow and jagged. Something wet hit the ground below us and got in Sean's hair. \"Ew.\" I breathed. We slowly looked up, and I kept myself from screaming. I knew I heard thudding in the distance….it was a dinosaur. A live one. Another drop of saliva dropped onto Sean's face. He moaned slightly, \"Sean. Shh.\" I murmured under my breath. Suddenly Sean tugged me up from where we sat and we started to run away from the beast. I stumbled a bit over a rock and fell to the ground; the dinosaur shrieked running towards us, I gasped and Sean shoved me into a crevice in a rock following me in. \"Sean, we're trapped. It's going to knock down this wall and we'll die. We're gonna die. I didn't even get a chance to go to Italy yet.\" I said. \"Well at least I don't have to die with someone I dislike.\" I whispered. \"Liv, we're not gonna die okay? Look!\" He said pointing to the wall behind us. There was a large crack already, and- crack! The wall now had a hole big enough for Sean and I to crawl through, \"Thank you so, so much Trevor!\" I yelled. \"Thanks uncle Trev-\" \"Run now! Thanks later!\" He yelled grinning. I screamed hearing the dinosaur snap at us as we ran. \"What are you doing?\" Sean shouted as he saw that the dinosaur was no longer after us, but Trevor. \"The geyser is that way!\" he pointed in the opposite direction. \"Over there is muscovite. The same type of rock we fell through in the volcanic tunnel.\" He frowned, \"It won't hold you!\" \"It won't hold him either!\" \"Trevor, no!\" I started in the direction he was going, however Sean grabbed my wrist. \"Liv, go back to the geyser! I'll get Trevor!\" He yelled. \"No! I'm coming with you!\" I cried. \"Please, Olivia.\" He begged. I looked deeply into his sad eyes, \"Be careful!\" I said kissing him once more and he ran off towards Trevor. I ran towards the geyser trying to wipe away the tears of concern. Sean would be fine. When I got to the geyser I sighed as the water was too hot for me to swim in. A few minutes later Sean and Trevor returned. \"I hate field work.\" Trevor mumbled. \"You two! Never do anything like that again.\" I exclaimed. \"Ow! Ok.\" Sean said. \"By the way the water's a bit hot.\" I said. \"We need a boat.\" Trevor said. \"Ok that's my next wish is for a million dollars.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Maybe you don't need a genie.\" Hannah grinned as she rowed towards us in a dinosaur skull. I gasped grinning climbing in. She smiled at them, \"Who called dibs?\" She asked. Trevor and Sean pointed at their chests and I laughed. \"Um…guys. We're loosing water. Fast.\" I said looking at how shallow the water had gotten and how thick the steam now was. A scream erupted is the water disappeared making the skull fall down. Thankfully, it was caught between the walls and couldn't budge much more than few meters. Sean peered over the edge, \"What's that light down there?\" \"That's lava-\" \"Lava!\" Sean exclaimed. I whimpered a bit taking in iron grip on Sean's arm. \"How do we get out of here?\" I asked. \"There's nothing we really can do... we ran out of water and that's the only way.\" Trevor replied. \"What about the geyser. What happened to it?\" Sean asked. Trevor shook his head at Sean's question, \"No. We are too late for the geyser. We missed it.\" I frowned at Trevor's definite sounding voice in his answer, \"How? The walls…they're still wet.\" I frowned. \"And cold.\" Sean added. \"That's not possible…it's over 130 degrees in here.\" He frowned. \"Behind you!\" I gestured. Trevor turned and felt the wall behind him. He pressed his hands against the surface and fold the cold slippery texture, \"There has to be some air pocket holding the water behind the walls.\" \"Trevor...\" Sean looked over the edge. \"The lava is getting closer.\" I swallowed refusing to look no matter how hard it seemed. Trevor sniffed his fingers, \"Hey. That's magnesium.\" He muttered. \"Magnesium?\" I inquired. Hannah gripped the wall, Sean the other. \"We're slipping!\" Hannah cried. Trevor turned to me and stretched his arm out, \"How many flares do we have left?\" \"Three,\" I took Hannah's backpack off her shoulder. Handing him the flares I eyed him carefully as he started pushing himself out of the skull and letting his entire torso swing over the edge. \"What are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to light the magnesium,\" he looked Hannah in the eye and winked. \"On purpose this time.\" They all watched as he lit the flare and held it against the wall. He cursed as it slipped from his fingers and fell down into the lava with a boom, \"It's too wet!\" Trevor yelled. \"I have to go further down. Hold my legs!\" Sean gripped his uncle's legs as Trevor completely left the skull. He swung his arm out, but the flare refused to ignite the magnesium. The light went out and he grunted as sweat dripped down his temples. Sean tugged him back into the skull. Hannah held out the last one and Trevor looked at her sternly, \"You are going to have to tie my legs. It's the only way I can get down far enough.\" He said. \"Trevor the lava's too close-\" I started. \"We don't have a choice.\" He said. I bit my lip looking at the lava and nodded, \"Be careful.\" Hannah said. Trevor was lowered over the edge and lit the flare. Pressing it against the wall he shook his head. He didn't understand why it wasn't working. But then he looked across at the other side of the wall and noticed that there appeared to be magnesium there as well. \"I'm going to have to throw it to the other side!\" he screamed. He didn't wait for a reply as he counted softly to himself and tossed it on three. We were all silent as a spark erupted. However, a wave of sadness came over them as it disappeared a second later. \"Wait…\" I whispered. \"It's lit, it's lit!\" screamed Sean. \"Trevor,\" Hannah excitedly followed suit. \"It's lit!\" \"Pull me up!\" he looked down at the lava oozing up towards him. \"Pull me up!\" \"Pull, pull, pull!\" Hannah chanted. He shoved them all to the ground quickly, \"Get down, it's going to blow!\" As if on cue, the wall bursted open and water poured out. When it met the lava it exploded into a gust of steamy air. We screamed as it pushed us upward. \"Is that sky?\" All of our eyes blinked up at the blue up ahead through the opening. Our screams continued as they cascaded up and burst out of the hole. \"Hang on!\" Trevor shouted. \"Trust me, I'm hanging on,\" Hannah sarcastically bit back. The skull touched the ground of the mountain and we were zipping through fields of fruit and vegetables at an alarming speed. But the denser the plants became the slower the skull was on its way down. \"Le mie piante! Il mio tutore bella! Stolti!\" There was an Italian farmer swinging his hands around wildly motioning up the mountains. His frantic shouts were ignored as we tried to come out of there shock. When we were all standing up, Trevor turned towards the mountain, \"Hey Sean. If your mom asks I took you to Italy?\" \"Italy?\" Sean frowned. \"How in heck did we end up in Italy?\" I frowned. \"La mia vita è rovinata ... come faccio a sostenere me e la mia famiglia?\" the Italian farmer looked ready to cry as he watched us all with wide terrified eyes. Sean dug into his backpack and pulled out one of the diamonds he had achieved on his journey. Going over to the man he held it out. In the worst Italian accent ever he gestured for the man to take it, \"You take this! We are sorry.\" \"Wow Sean...That's a new accent to try out.\" I laughed. \"Sean!\" Trevor held up the bag of jewels looking at his nephew skeptically, \"Sean.\" \"What?\" he shrugged his shoulders. \"I just took a few geological samples.\" \"A few?\" \"A few pounds of samples, but what do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.\" The Italian man hugged the diamond, \"You slide again?\" He asked gesturing towards the mountain. \"Heck to the no.\" I said eyes wide. \"Take whatever you want!\" he urged with a wide grin. I smiled a bit and turned to the rest of them, only for me and Sean to catch Hannah and Trevor kissing. Sean frowned placing his arm around my shoulders and I hissed in pain, \"Sorry! Sorry!\" He said moving his arm to my waist. \"It's ok.\" I said kissing him then hearing his uncle when we were done, \"Look who has dibs now.\" He teased. I cracked a smile, \"Come on its high time we go home.\" I said.[Chapter 8] 8 Disclaimer except Olivia. \"So…Um…I guess this is goodbye.\" I said trying not to cry. Sure Hannah said we could visit sometime but I didn't want to have him go. We had gone to a hospital in Italy and my shoulder was bandaged properly and a day later once back in Iceland Sean and Trevor had to leave. \"Yeah. I guess it is.\" He said giving my hand a squeeze. \"Flight 504 to Washington, D.C.\" The flight attendant called. I threw my arms around Sean in a tight embrace. \"I'll miss you.\" I said. \"I'll miss you too.\" He whispered. We shared one last kiss and I waved as Trevor finished saying goodbye in pretty much the same fashion to Hannah and I gave Trevor a hug and the two boarded the plane. I smiled sadly and waved to Sean. \"Alright come on. Let's go home.\" Hannah said putting her arm around my shoulders, \"I say we get some ice cream. We need it.\" I sighed. She nodded, \"Big time, Olive.\" She smiles. Three months later I had been constantly texting Sean, texts, IM, video-chat, e-mail everything. He told me Trevor decided to open up his new institute in Canada so he could be closer to him. I told him that was great and that nothing changed around here. Just…normal. Go to school hike on the weekends, read…not much exciting in Iceland. I walked into the house throwing my backpack on the kitchen table. \"Olivia?\" I heard Hannah call. \"Yeah?\" I asked. \"I need to talk to you could you come into the living room?\" She asked. \"Sure.\" I said grabbing a soda popping it open as I walked into the living room. \"What's up?\" I asked. \"Well…Sean told you that Trevor is opening up a new institute in Canada right?\" She asked. I nodded and she went on, \"He offered me a job there.\" She said. I smiled. \"Yes.\" I smiled more. \"Please take it, Hannah!\" I begged. \"Pretty please!\" I pouted. \"I…I think I want to.\" She smiled. \"Yes!\" I screamed. \"We're moving to Canada!\" I exclaimed hugging Hannah. \"Let's get packing! I want to get on the first flight out of here!\" I cried grinning. A month later we had moved out of Iceland and into a suburb in Canada. Only a few blocks a way from Sean and fifteen minutes from the institute, plus we were still close enough driving distance to drive up to mountains and do some hiking on weekends. But I think life has become less boring and routine since that trip to the center of the earth. Talk about a vacation. The end. (Until Journey 2! Look for it in the journey 2 the mysterious island category!)

REVIEW! PLEASE! \"Mom! Why?\" I yelled. I don't want to go with my godfather, Trevor. I mean I like him, but he is not the problem… The problem is Sean Anderson, his nephew. I hate him. He goes to my school, and he is a complete jerk. \"I said you are going and that's my final word! And if you say anything else I'll make you stay more days! \" She said and I stormed off to my room. I sat on my bed furiously. Alright time to introduce myself, my name is Alyssa Evans, I'm thirteen years old, I hate Sean Anderson. The truth is we were friends before, until one day that he stopped talking to me and started being a jerk. I don't want to be with him, but I have to since my mother is travelling for her job and she won't allow me to go with her, the thing is I don't know why Sean is coming, heard he is moving to Canada or something. I sighed as the doorbell rang. I grabbed my suitcase and walked downstairs. When I got down my mom was talking with Elizabeth, Sean's mom. Her and my mom are really good friends, actually because of my mom Elizabeth met Max, as Trevor was my mom best friend and Elizabeth her best friend she made Elizabeth to meet Max and well they married and created the most jerk of this world, Sean. \"Hello Ally!\" Said Elizabeth. \"Are you excited?\" \"Yeah…\" I said and rolled my eyes as I got my stuff in the trunk. Sean was in the front seat playing with his PSP, what a surprise. He had the window opened so I smirked and covered the PSP screen with my hand. \"HEY! DON'T DO THAT! YOU MADE ME LOST!\" He yelled at me and frowned looking at me with his beautiful hazel eyes... Wait… No He doesn't have beautiful eyes, What's wrong with me? . I smirked with an eye roll. \"Oh Hello Sean I'm fine thanks. How are you?\" I said with a smirk. He stuck his tongue at me. I opened the back door and sat then closed the door. I got my iPod out and started to listen to music. This was going to be a long ride. The trip went as I thought, long. Elizabeth called many times Trevor and he obviously didn't answer. When we finally arrived I stayed there listening to music until Trevor knocked the window. I smiled and got out. \"'Sup Trevor\" I said, Sean was still focused with his game. \"Hey Lys\" He said. \"Hey Sean, How are you? Looking good huh?\" Sean rolled his eyes and kept with his game. I slapped him in his head. \"Ouch\" He said. \"Sean say Hi to your uncle\" Said Elizabeth. Sean rolled his eyes and got off the car and said \"Hi to your uncle\" with an eye roll. I rolled my eyes. \"Idiot\". We both, Sean and I got in the house. Trevor and Elizabeth kept talking outside. \"Alright, look I hate you, but please be nice to my godfather… Well your uncle okay?\" I told him. \"And why should I listen to you?\" He said with a smirk. I rolled my eyes and took his beanie off and started running. He was following me yelling things like 'give it back' or 'I'll kill you if don't give it' I kept running but then stop and turned around. He tripped with me and fall on top of me. We both stared at each other eyes for a moment, when Trevor entered, and looked at us with a smirk .He was blushing \"Get of me kiddo\" I told him. He stood up and offered me a hand, I rolled my eyes and ignored his hand standing up. He cleared his throat and looked away. \"So, hey, dude and girl. This is gonna be fun. A couple of dudes and a girl hanging days, maybe a know, doing dude and girl stuff, what dudes and a girl do. You like baseball? You know what we should do? We should go get in a batting cage.\" Said Trevor, I shrugged and Sean rolled his eyes and said \"Yeah, okay, listen. We don't like this any more than you do, As long as you keep stocked with Mountain Dewand TiVo Family Guy,we'll get along fine.\" I elbowed him in the ribs. He rolled his eyes and walked to the living room. \"Oh, wow. That's an awesome coin collection.\" He said sarcastically. Trevor said something about it was a project of him but I wasn't really listening to him, he asked if we were hungry while opening a box. \"What's that?\" I asked. \"Well, it's a box of possessions of a really great guy. Sean's dad\" Sean looked at him. I knew he lost his father… Well he didn't know where he was. He had that look that made me want to hug me but I resisted. \"Mom doesn't talk about him very much\" Sean said finally looking down. God why was he so adorable? NO! HE ISNT ADORABLE! I just can't think that about Sean…But he is… No! What's happening to you Alyssa? Great now I'm talking to myself…in my mind. Whatever no one can hear me, Alyssa listen to me… Duh Of course I'm myself… Wow I need to get a doctor. So Trevor said about something of Journey to the Center of the earth… I read it, I liked it. Wait when did Sean get a yo-yo? \"LOOK OUT!\" yelled Sean and suddenly the yoyo flew and hit this thing Trevor had in the ceiling with a lot of little balls, the little balls hit Trevor's head but he didn't even notice. \"Hey guys let's go and check my lab\" He said. \"So… It couldn't wait for tomorrow?\" Sean said. I was sitting on a chair spinning around. \"Your dad used to say Tectonophysics is the science of now,not tomorrow\" Trevor answered and kept looking at the computer. \"It's about seismic events that occur in an instant.\" He said pointing to the screen, I looked at it. \" Here, look at this. You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia. And the conditions today are almost exactly what they were in July '97.\" \"What's the big deal about July '97?\" I asked curiously. Trevor looked down and Sean raised a brow. \"That was the year when Sean dad's went missing\" He finally said. Sean looked away but then pushed my chair to the other side of the room. I came back and stuck my tongue out hitting him on the shoulder. He smirked. Trevor kept saying things that I wasn't listening I just kept looking at the other computer screen. \"What do these little blips mean?\" I asked pointing at the screen. \"Don't touch anything those little blips are my life's work.\" Trevor said I snorted and Sean chuckled lightly. \"These four little blips are your life's work?\" I said . Sean rolled his eyes giggling. \"Three, three little bleeps\" Answered Trevor. I raised a brow. \"One, two, three…. Four\" Said Sean counting them. \"Congratulations you know how to count\" I said with a smirk patting him on the shoulder. He glared at me. \"Iceland\" Said Trevor. \"This makes sense!\" Said Trevor when we arrived at his house. \"Max saw the readings 10 years ago,and he took off to investigate. Now, if the readings are the same today as they were the…this may be my only chance to find out what happened.\" Sean and I raised a brow. \"Im gonna need your passports\" Trevor said. \"For what?\" I asked annoyed. \"I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada a little earlier than we planned. And Ally you'll need to find someone else to take care of you\" He answered. Sean scowled and said \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about this. A Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" He said throwing the book to Sean. \"It's all set in Iceland,which is where he must've gone.\" \"These are all my dad's notes?\" Sean asked, I stepped closer to him and looked at the book. \"Look... Max and I…Your dad and I were talking about the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...that went down past the mantle, towards the center of the Earth. And that's what I think he went looking for.\" Trevor said and grabbed the phone.\"Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight to Ottawa in the morning, Ally, you'll go with Sean. - And I'm calling Icelandair.\" Sean unplugged the phone cable. \"Hey\" Protested Trevor. \"We just got here, okay? You're not gonna go and ditch us. And perhaps I was the person who found your life's work fourth little blip thingy in the first place.\" I cleared my throat. \"Alright Lys…Alyssa was the the person who found your life's work fourth little blip thingy\" \"This is my brother we're talking about.\" Trevor protested AGAIN. \"And his father\" I said pointing at Sean with my finger. \"Now, we don't have to be in Ottawa for 10 days. We're going with you.\" Sean said. I crossed my arms with a smirk. \"Know how much to book a last-minute flight to Reykjavík\" Trevor said. \"Something tells me you got it covered.\" Answered Sean with a smirk looking at the coins.[Chapter 2] I dont own anything but Alyssa... A shame I'd love to own Josh ;) REVIEW! We were on the plane, me in the middle, Trevor in the window, and Sean in the other side playing with his yo-yo. I was listening to music in my iPod with my eyes closed, as always Muse. I tapped my foot as the drums of the song were going, until I stopped hearing the music. I looked around and saw Sean now listening to my music. He smirked as I looked at him with a frown. He started to sing Madness almost shouting, I laughed, I love when people embarrass their selves. I rolled my eyes and let him with one of the earphones and put the other one on my ear. He raised a brow, I think he is surprised of me; I didn't hit him this time for taking my earphone because he was being nice with me… He was acting different really kind and wasn't being rude. Trevor was reading the book out loud and made strange noises. We bot,h Sean and I chuckled lightly, while Trevor was doing annotations and mumbling things. \"What are you doing?\" I asked him. \"I am deciphering these notations Sean's father made in this book.\" Trevor answered. \"Oh hmm… Cool\" I told him. \"I think there's a code behind the pairing of letters, It's based on the periodic table… For instances I've got S-A, I-S, C-G… I believe that hmm P-B is on the periodic table… and that's plumbum and plumbum means lead.\" \"What's Sigurbjörn Ásgerisson?\" I asked him looking at the book. \"What?\" He asked and Seand looked at me raising a brow trying to look at the book. I sighed and said pointing at the book \"It is right here, read it, Sigubjörn Ásgerisson\" \"Oh… Sigubjörn Ásgerisson\" Trevor said \"It's..um… That's a clue! Maybe that's a place…It could be a thing\" I looked at Sean like saying Help!. He nodded and got his PSP out googling it. \"What are you doing?\" Trevor asked him, I rolled my eyes. \"He is googling at 30,000 feet.\" Trevor raised a brow and said \"Can you be doing that thing?\" I patted Trevor in the shoulder and sighed \"Welcome to the 21st century.\" \"Okay here, It's a person Sigubjörn Ásgerisson\" Sean said, I got closer to him to read the information; he looked at me and pecked me on the cheek with a smirk. He knows I hate that, I glared at him. \"Just don't get that close if you don't want me to do that girl\" He said smirking and sending me a kiss. I punched him in the arm. \"Ouch!\" I grabbed the PSP so Trevor can read it. \"He is the director of the Institute for Progressive Volcanology\" I said reading the article. \"Max would have known him. I knew it was good to bring you two\" Trevor said smiling, I rolled my eyes. \"The institute is going to be our first stop\" \"Are we there yet?\" I asked \"If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there\" Trevor said. \"You're going kinda slow\" Sean said. \"I'm going safe\" \"I saw a goat in the passing lane!\" Sean protested;I looked back. Yep there was definitely a goat in there. I sighed and said \"When's the whole adventure thing going to begin?\" \"I'll give you both something fun to do\" He said giving me the map. \"Navigate\" I got to the middle seat and then Sean and I opened the map laying it in our laps. \"Where are we?\" Asked Trevor. I looked confused at the map. \"Have we passed Havanschlicht?\"Sean asked.\"Havanschlitch?\"Trevor asked confused \"Yeah\" I said. Trevor shook his head \"I don't know\" \"Did we pass Eingarsstadir?\" Sean asked. \"I don't know\" \"Reynivir?\" I asked. Sean and I smirked thinking on the same thing, saying random names. \"I don't know\" \"Húsavik?\" Sean asked \"NO!\" \"Grundarhol? I asked \"NO!\" \"Sitfflarschtarder?\" Sean asked. \"Stiff-lard-starter?\" Trevor said. \"How about Koldukardarskinoquue?\" I asked. I didn't even know how the hell I pronounced that. \"What?\" Sean and Trevor asked. I shrugged chuckling. \"So… we are lost\" I said \"We are not lost, just look for an Institution\" Trevor said. \"What's it look like? \" Sean asked. \"I don't know… Big and institutional\" Trevor answered. Oh really? I rolled my eyes. \"Look there is a little shack on there; maybe we can stop and ask for directions\" I said. Sean and Trevor looked at me, right they are men and won't dare to stop for directions. I rolled my eyes \"What? Just stop!\" I yelled at them. \"Yeah stop I want to pee\" Said Sean. I made a disgusted face. \"Ugh… Did we really need to know about that?\" I asked him and he smirked. \"Yes, especially you.\" Trevor stopped and Sean got of the car quickly closing the door in my face. I glared at him and he was smirking; then he opened it again. \"Oh I'm sorry thought you were going to get out from the other side\" He said and I kicked him. \"We are not lost\" Said Trevor \"Oh no definitely not\" Said Sean sarcastically. \"What's this?\" I asked . \"Ásgerisson blah blah blah blah blah Insitute for Progressive Volcanology\" Trevor said with a smug. \"I told you guys I'd find it\" I rolled my eyes. \"Oh right… Not too shabby\" Said Trevor and then knocked the door. Someone said something in Icelandic and we three looked confused. \"I'm sorry We don't speak Icelandic\"I said. A beautiful woman opened the door Sean's and Trevor's eyes widened and looked at her with their mouths open. I rolled my eyes. \"Hello I'm Hannah\" She said. As they both were still loking at her in amazement . \"Oh… How do you do? Hi I'm Trev- Proffesor Anderson. I'm visiting from America\" They shook hands, Trevor was still amazed and I think Hannah was a bit scared of him. \"Oh and these are… \" \"I'm Sean\" Sean said trying to flirt. They shook hands. \"Sean my nephew\" Said Trevor \"I'm Alyssa\" I said smiling trying not to laugh at them while she shook my hand. \"Hi Sean, Hey Alyssa\" she said. \"And Alyssa my goddaughter\" \"So hmm we wanted to talk with forgive me here… Sigubjörn Ásgerisson?\" \"Oh hmm.. He is dead\" Said Hannah looking down. \"Dead?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah is when someone is not alive\" I answered him. \"I got that\" Said Sean and glared at me, I shrugged it off \"Yeah he died three winters ago\" Said Hannah. \"I'm sorry\" I said looking at Hannah \"So do you run the institute?\" Asked Trevor. \"Nobody does. There is no institute\" \"But there's sign on the road that says… \" Started Trevor but Hannah cut him \"Progressive Volcanology was a failed idea like the Berlin Wall and 8-track tapes\" I grinned at the last one. \"I see..hmm did you work for him?\" \"Oh no…no he was my father\" We got in the house and she offered us some hot chocolate. I was shivering so she gave me a blanket. Trevor showed her the Journey to the center of the earth book. She raised a brow as I did. I looked at Trevor like asking 'what the hell?' . \"Yeah I know it… What about it?\" Said Hannah \"Oh hmm this book belonged to my late brother, Max\" Trevor said. Uh huh… So what with it? Sean looked down, I patted his back. \"Max Anderson?\" He continued. \"We believe that he had being in contact your father\" \"Your brother was a vernian\" She said. I raised a brow looking confused. \"What's a vernian?\" Asked Sean, thank god, I did want to know but I didn't dare to ask. \"Someone who believes that the writings of Jules Verne were actual fact\" Sean and I nodded, he stared at me for a while but I didn't pay attention to him. \"The guy was a science fiction writer... but hmm this society if believers regarded Verne as a visionary. My father was the biggest vernian of them all\" \"My brother was no Vernian\" said Trevor. Hannah grabbed the book and look through it, then went for another book. \"This was my father's copy\" She opened both books at the same page. \" Take a look…See the markings are exactly the same…Your brother was a Vernian\" \"Wow… My dad was kind of… out there\" Sean said and I glared at him. \"You didn't know him Sean\" I told him \"She is right you didn't\" Said Trevor. \"I'm starting to believe you didn't either\" \"He was no member of some secret society\" Said Trevor. Sean grabbed the book and we both started looking through it. \"What are you guys doing here?\" Hannah asked finally. THAT'S THE SAME BLOODY QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKING TO MYSELF IN THE LAST 10 MINUTES! \"I'm a scientist, I'm a professor. I'm here because seismic sensors are going off 30 klicks north of here \" Answered Trevor. Oh right… the sensors… totally forgot. \"We should check it. That's why we are here. Plain and simple.\" Simple? Was that simple? \"Okay… You know there are no roads to the north\" She said. Great we came here for nothing. I rolled my eyes. \"Well….Then we should go back to… \" I started but Hannah cut me off . \"I'm a mountain guide. I can take you there professor\" \"Great\" Trevor said. \"I love hiking!\" Said Sean. I smirked… Perfect time to tease him… \"Oh yeah like the last time you went hiking and you… Oh right you had never hike\" I said smirking, he glared. \"I'd appreciate that, that'll be fine\" He said and they all looked at me. \"Hiking… with this cold!?\" I asked. \"Seriously?... Alright fine.\" I glared at the ground. \"Call me Trevor\" He said \"Oh and call me Sean\" I smirked and looked at him…\"You'll learn to flirt someday kiddo\" I said. \"Oh shut up\" he yelled at me hitting me with the book. \"Good… It will be 5,000 kronur\" She said. \"Five grand a day? No problem!\" Trevor said enthusiastically. \"An hour\" She said. \"Hmm… Do you accept rolls of quarters?\" I asked.[Chapter 3] Here's the thrid chapter... I am sorry if it is long... But... Well review! I own anything but Alyssa We were hiking, Hannah leading me behind her, and the boys at the end. I couldn't believe they are that slow. \"Come on, boys.I wanna be home by sundown.\" Hannah said. I looked at them, Sean tripped, I laughed so hard and well then… I tripped. Sean laughed and said with a smirk \"Karma, sweet karma\" I stood up and kept going. \"Hey, you think you can slow down a little bit, please?\" Asked Trevor. I ignored him and climbed more, Hannah turned and looked at us. \"Dibs\" Sean said, and I turned around raising a brow- \"What?\" Trevor asked. \"I got dibs on the mountain guide.\" Sean answered; I rolled my eyes with a snort. Yeah as if a foreign woman is going to put her eyes on her. \"You're 13.\" Trevor told him with a frown. \"Sorry, called it.\" Said sean with a smirk, I chuckled while climbing. \"Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.\" Said Trevor mad. \"Get over it\" I kept walking… Well climbing and Sean poked my shoulder. \"Jealous?\" He said with a smirk, I raised a brow. \"Huh?\" He smirked. \"You are jealous\" He said poking my cheek, I suppose I blushed… \"Jealous of what?\" I asked furiously. \"You know what I'm talking about\" \"Actually no, that's the reason of why I'm asking duh!\" He smirked and pecked me on the cheek I pushed him and he tripped. I ran. Finally we found the thingy. Trevor was trying to get it off, but then Hannah looked at the sky and said \" Trevor, I'm really sorry, we're gonna have to go now.\" A storm was coming. Trevor as stubborn as always forcedly wanted to take the sensor. \"Trevor, we need to... Whoa.\" I said looking at the lightening. \"Okay, we need to take on, Sean, Alyssa. Right now.\" Yelled Hannah at us. Sean and her went into a little cave \"I'll be right there\" I went and tried to help Trevor. \"I swear Trevor, if this thing doesn't kill you I'm killing you\" I told him. Suddenly a lightening… Really near us. We finally got the thingy out and started running towards the cave were Sean and Hannah were standing. \"Trevor, the sensor's attracting the lightning. Drop it. Drop the sensor.\" Yelled Hannah, she was right everywhere we walked a lightening… \"What? I'm not going to drop it!\" Yelled Trevor. \"DROP IT TREVOR!\" I yelled at him. \"It's attracting the lightening\" Yelled Hannah multiple times. Trevor finally dropped the sensonr and a Lightening fell in it and the sensor exploded, I quickly got in the cave and just heard a boom. Everything was dark, I fell. I tried to stand up but there was something over me and I couldn't move, I tried to push it, and then realized it was Sean. \"Is everyone okay?\" Asked Hannah. \"Yeah, the floor isn't that rough\" said Sean; I cleared my throat and then said \"Well yes that is pretty obvious as you landed above me…\" I heard Hannah and Trevor chuckled lightly; Sean stood up and helped me. \"Sorry\" He said. He apologized… Wow that's new in him. \"Okay, everybody, just stay calm.\" Said Hannah. Sean stood and went straight to the rocks trying to dig or something \"Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.\" He yelled scared. \"It's no use… There are a lot of rocks…It would be stupid,it would take us a month or more Forget it \" I told him rolling my eyes. \"Forget it?\" Sean asked. \"She is right; there must be about 60 or 70 tons of boulders on top of us. Take us about a month to dig out of here.\" Said Trevor. \"Told ya\" I said and sighed. \"We have to find another way.\" Said Trevor. \"What if there is no other way?\" Sean was freaking out, I laughed at his reaction. \"There's always another way, Sean.\" Hannah said hanging us some lights. \"Why so calmed Lys...Ally...Alyssa?\" Sean asked me. He didn't dare to call me with a nickname. Wait he is right… Why am I so calmed? \"Because this is obviously a nightmare… I mean me with a foreign girl, Trevor and you trapped in a cave… Yeah definitely a nightmare especially with you around here Sean\" I lied with a smirk putting this lantern on my head. Sean came and pinched my arm \"Ouch\" I said and then he told me \"This is not a nightmare this is real\"Trevor asked Hannah what things she had on her back pack, I wasn't really paying attention, realizing I was trapped… But… This can't be… Hahaha Sean is freaking out like hell. Sean got his cellphone out and I guessed he was trying to get any service. \"I'm not getting any service on here\" He said, yep I was right. I walked near him and ripped his phone of his hand. \"Seriously you are trying to get singal in the middle of nowhere in a cave? Intelligent … huh?\" He stared at me and then nodded. \"Put this thingy away. Okay? Don't worry about it. We'll get out of here I promise\" He sighed and nodded. \"Alright\" he said. I smiled \"That's my Sean\" I said. He smirked \"Your Sean… Why… Miss Evans wants me to be of her property?\" He said; I rolled my eyes. Yeah that's definitely the Sean I know. \"Don't get your hopes kiddo\" I told him and turned around. \"And that's my Ally\" He said, I smirked. Trevor chose a path and we walked throught it He kept saying about his sixth sense, field work and stuff like that. Suddenly Hannah pushed me and grabbed Trevor's shirt saving him from falling. \"You're not studying rocks in a lab, professor.- This is life or death here.\" Hannah told him punching him on the arm \"You owe me one\" I looked around and saw a sign with something in Icelandic written on it \"What does it say?\" I asked Hannah. \"That means keep out.\" Said Hannah \"Maybe that's decent advice.\" Said Sean. \"Baby\" I said, he glared at me. \"No, no. This is great news. This might lead us to an old mine shaft and that could be our way out.\" \"How deep do you think it is?\" I asked. Sean was really scared. \"Can you give me one of those flares?\" Trevor asked Hannah. Hannah gave him one and then he continued. \"Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.\" Sean lifted his sleeve and looked at his watch nodding. \"I'm gonna light this and drop it over the edge... and I want you to tell me how many seconds pass before it stops.\" Said Trevor and Sean nodded. \"Okay\" He said. I looked at the cave… Was that magnesium? \"Hmm Trevor…\" I started, but he had already lit the flare. \"Here we go. Three, two...\" BOOM! Yep, it was magnesium. I coughed and felt something above me, again Sean. \"You're starting to like this huh?\" I told him trying to shove him away. I saw his cheek turned darker, he obviously blushed, and even if it was dark I could notice it. He mumbled something I didn't understand and I stood up. \"What? What was that?\" Hannah asked. Trevor looked at the walls, and smelled them or something. \"Yup, magnesium Must run in veins all through these walls.\" He said. \"I wanted to tell you! But oh no you were like 'I'm Trevor, I'm stubborn, and I won't listen to Alyssa'\" I snapped and Sean chuckled. \"Magnesium is kinda flammable isn't it professor?\" Hannah said. \"Yeah, used in flares, used in gun powder, matchsticks.\" Trevor answered trying to sound intelligent. \"Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares aren't such a good idea down here.\" Said Hannah giving Trevor this luminous stick thingy. \"Thank you, It's the same principle. You ready, Sean?\" Trevor said. \"Yeah go ahead\" Sean told him looking at his watch. \"Three, two, one\" \"One…Two…Almost three\" Said Sean. I did my maths… \"It's like 200 feet right?\" I asked, Trevor Sean and Hannah looked at me surprised. \"I do pay attention in class, so hmmm Hannah do you think you have enough rope?\" I asked trying to ignore the awkwardness. \"I always have enough rope\" answered Hannah. \"Enough rope for what?\" Sean asked confussed. \"For rappelling down in there! Duh!\" I told him, his hazel green eyes widened. \"We're gonna rappel downthat deep, dark hole?\" Sean asked, he didn't seem to believe it. \"What, you got a problem with that?\" Trevor asked him. \"Pfft\" \"What's the matter?\" I asked. \"There's no way we should be rappelling down.\" Sean answered, I chuckled. \"What are you talking about? You're man enough to call dibs on the guide, and staring at Ally's butt. But not enough to climb down a rope?\" Trevor asked. \"Guys!\" Hannah interrupted. \"No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.\" I slapped Sean. \"YOU DID WHAT?\" He just looked away and then glared at Trevor, Trevor laughed and then said \"We're going down there.\" \"Steady, steady\" Hannah told Sean. I was already climbing down. Sean was shivering. HA! \"Karma, sweet karma\" I said. Sean glared at me. \"Looking 's all good down here. Way down here.\"Said Trevor \"You guys are coming right?\" I said. I looked around, I was scared, I really was, maybe I didn't show it but I was. What if we never got out of there? I looked at my left, Sean was there looking really scared.I smirked. \"Hey, you're looking pretty good there.\" I told him,he glared. \"Sure you haven't done this before Sean?\" Trevor teased, I chuckled, while chuckling Sean's foot lost balance and made some pebbles fall. \"Hey you mind, watch your step will you?\" Trevor said. \"I'm hanging on for my life here.\" Hannah got with us. \"It's okay Sean, just make conversation with Alyssa.\" I raised a brow. \"With me?\" \"Yes, it will help you both.\" Sean looked at me awkwardly. \"So hmmm Ally do you come here often?\" I laughed. \"Seriously?\" I teased . \"Oh, give me a break. That can't be the best line you can come up with.\" Trevor said slightly chuckling. \"I'm making conversation with her!\"Sean said furiously. \"No Sean, I don't come here often\" I said giggling and rolled my eyes. He smiled. \"Hey. Look at all this schist.\" Trevor said. SHIT? ARE WE RAPPELLING ON SHIT?! \"What?\" Sean asked confused, think he heard the same thing as I did. \"It's a metamorphic rock. Green schist, garnet schist, mica-garnet schist.\" I sighed I relief. \"Oh, schist\" Sean said. \"It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...\" Trevor started but something happened to his rope, and we were all hanging. I was going to fall but Sean helped me to get closer to the wall. \"You're gonna take us down. I gotta cut you lose.\" Said Hannah. \"NO!\" I yelled. \"Hannah, no!\" yelled Sean, too late Hannah had already cut Trevor's rope. He was only like5 inches away from the ground. \"Hey, guys, found it. The bottom's right here. Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right? Right? Hannah?\" Said Trevor, and Hannah didn't answer. I got to the ground. \"Don't worry bet she did know\" I lied to him. I walked through this cave. \"Hey, guys what's this?\"\"Looks like an abandoned mine tunnel to me.\" Answered Trevor. I looked around. \"That's Old Bla'gils Mine. It was shut down 60 years ago after the big disaster.\" Hannah said. \"Disaster?\" I asked. \"How big?\" \"Eighty-one dead.\" \"That's pretty big.\" Trevor said. Indeed it was. Great I was in a cave trapped with my crazy Godfather, a foreign girl, and Sean. The last one tapped my shoulder. \"You scared?\" He said with a smirk. I must have made a face. \"Not as much as you\" I answered him, I smirked and he just glared. \"Trevor was there a mine like this in the book?\" Sean asked. Didn't he read it? It was on the summer books list. No there wasn't a mine, as far as I remember. \"No, don't think so.\" Trevor answered and started to talk with Hannah, I didn't really pay attention to him, I was just focusing on the ground. I was scared, really scared, what if we didn't get out of here? I was thinking about all that when suddenly I crashed with this big thing. It looked like an old generator, I started to press random buttons and pulling things, Hannah copied me. \"Uh… Hannah Ally, I don't think that's safe\" Said Sean, as if he cared for my safety. Pfft! HA! \"This is the old generator for the mine\" Explained Hannah. \"Hey, you don't want to touch that.\" Trevor said. The machine started to make strange noises, but I kept pressing buttons, pulling handles. \"Stop! That thing could blow! Don't do that. No, wait. Get away from that thing.\" Suddenly all the mine had light. Trevor laughed and raised his hands. \"Okay, I take it back\" \"Good idea Lys\" Hannah told me, I looked at her confused. \"About turning on this thing\" Uhm actually I just wanted to press the buttons. \"Oh yeah… Thanks\" I said. Sean walked pushing me. I rolled my eyes.\"This is it, right? I mean, the miners, they had to get their stuff out somewhere.\" He said. That was true. \"These tracks could lead us out. \" He continued enthusiastically. Wait, the disaster. \"Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?\" I asked. She hesitated and said \" Um, one\" I shrugged. \"That's a start\" Sean said. We looked at each other. \"I CALL FRONT!\" He yelled. \"OH NO!I CALL FRONT ANDERSON!\" I ran after him but he pushed me and I tripped. I will take my revenge Anderson, I swear I will. \"What? No, no, no. Come on, don't get in there. We don't even know if these things work.\" Trevor said helping me to stand up. \"They're not safe. The tracks might not be safe.\" Suddenly Hannah appeared with this thing that they use in mines, I don't know their name. I mean why would I know the name? I didn't study \"MINE ARTIFACTS\" in school. I just knew that if you pulled the handle the \"cart\" will move… Anyway back to the reality. \"Track ahead looks good. Get in.\" Said Hannah. I walked to the second cart, but before I got in Trevor jumped in the cart. \"No room on here\" He said with a smirk. \"Guess you will have to go with Sean\" he teased. I sighed and jumped in the cart where Sean was. \"Hey Girl\" He said with a smirk. I rolled my eyes and kick him. \"Oi\" Now I was the one who smirked. \"Okay, I know you won't like this … But wrap your arms around my waist\" Sean said turning red. \"I beg your pardon?\" I said. \"Or you can fall of the cart if you want\" He said, blushing even more. I rolled my eyes and did as he said. \"Why Mister Anderson. I believe I saw a tinge of red upon your cheek\" I told him teasingly. \"N-No\" He said and stood up. \"Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe. I wouldn't do that.\" Trevor said behind us. \"I think I see something. It's...\" Sean started; yeah I saw something too… I wasn't sure what it was but… \"Please tell me it's daylight. Otherwise, I don't wanna know.\" Trevor said. \"Then you don't want to know!\" I told him. \"Uh oh we're in deep schist!\" Sean said. I gripped him tighter, while we were in this sort of… hmm how can I explain.. Hmm rollercoaster. We all started to scream. \"I wished there were seatbelts on this thing!\" Sean yelled. \"YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SEATBELTS?\" I yelled at him. I looked in front of me. \"Uh…Hannah\" \"I know!\" She yelled. \"Pull the brake! Pull the brake!\" Trevor said. \"No, don't. We won't make it.\" We went faster, I closed my eyes. We were flying. \"YEAH! WHOO!\" Sean yelled. We split in three rails, Sean and I in one, Hannah in another and Trevor in the last one. \"STAY PUT!\" I heard Trevor yelling. I let Sean go and raised my arms. \"Whoo!\" I shouted. I loved Roller Coasters. Sean turned around and laughed. We stared into each other eyes. That was getting awkward, I needed to do something quickly. I waved in front of his face. \"Whatcha staring at?\" He turned around and the cart finally stopped. Sean jumped out of the cart, we found Hannah laying on Trevor. \"THAT WAS AWESOME\"Sean said, I jumped of the cart. \"Sure it was! Wait… What happened to you guys?\" I asked them. \"Don't ask\" Said Trevor, I looked behind us. There was a cave, I got in and Sean followed me. \"What's that?\" He asked me, I shrugged. \"Guys, where are you going? Don't go in there. Alyssa, Sean come back!\" Trevor yelled. \"Are you kidding me? I won't go back this could be our way out!\" I yelled at him. \"Oh my…\" I said and looked around. \"Guys check at this\" Sean said. \"Rubies\" Hannah said taking one. \"Emeralds\" Sean said. \"Feldspar\" Trevor said. Nice one Trevor,thanks for ruining the moment. \"Uh guys… There is more\" I said looking at all the diamonds taking a few in my backpack… A few pounds okay… \"Diamonds\" Trevor started to explain things about volcanic tubes… Wait… \"This could get us out of here right?\" I said. Trevor nodded. \"When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.\" Sean said. I looked at him and snorted. \"I'm sorry but if you bought it you couldn't drive it… You are 13!\" \"Money is not the only thing that matters, Sean. People matter too, you know.\" \"Not if you have a Maserati, and yes I'm 13… So what? I'll grow. You are just jealous\" Sean said, I rolled my eyes, is he ever stupid? CRACK. \"wha…what was that?\" I asked and looked at the ground. \"Nobody move\" \"Tell me that's not what I think it is.\" Trevor said nervously. \"Muscovite\" Hannah said. \"Muscovite\" Trevor said. \"Oh… Muscovite! Yeah How couldn't I know it?\" I said sarcastically. \"What's muscovite?\" Sean asked. The cracking sound continued. \"Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.\" Trevor started \"How thin?\"Sean interrupted him. \"Well, so thin that the slightest change in weight and pressure…can cause it to shatter. And we're standing on a lot of it.\" The Cracking noises stopped, I looked at everyone and stopped at Sean. \"Okay, they're stopped. I need both to walk back exactly the way we came from. Very, very calmly, okay?\" Sean and I nodded and started to walk as said. Sean held my shaking hand into his and kept walking. We were almost there when… \"NO!\" A diamond fall from Sean's backpack. I tried to pick it. Too late, it hit the ground. Cracking noises here and there. But it didn't break. We all sighed in relief and chuckled nervously. \"It's actually thicker than I thought!\" Trevor said. CRACK. It broke, we were falling. A/N: So that was the third chapter! Review! I know its long.. but :PP[Chapter 4] A/N: So here's the 4th chapter... Sorry I've been busy! Hope you like it. I don't own anything but my OC Alyssa. Thanks for your reviews! We were all falling. I was scared. We were all screaming. I realized I was still holding Sean's hand. I let him go. I closed my eyes waiting for the crash, screaming… Wait… We were still… Does this thing have any end? \"WE ARE STILL FALLING!\" Trevor yelled. You know those moments when your life goes in front of your eyes because you know you are going to die? Well… That was one of those moments. I opened my eyes. We all held each other hands. This was getting kinda boring, we were still falling… Is that possible? \"Trevor, what's at the bottom?\" Sean asked. The book, what happened in the book? Ugh I couldn't remember! \"Well, if what Verne wrote was right…these tunnels could go for hundreds, thousands of miles.\" Trevor answered him. RIGHT! But… He is just a science fiction writer… Was he right? \"VERNE WAS NOT RIGHT!\" Hannah yelled. Uhmm… Thanks for your optimism. \"Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?\" Sean asked. Wait… Now I did remember… Gosh no please! I want to live! \"It just ends!\" I said, and Trevor nodded. \"Ends? Got any other theories?\" Sean asked. \"There will be unicorns waiting for us in the paradise!\" I said. Wait… What the hell did I just say? \"Well, the walls of this tunnel could have gently eroded…by water which still runs through it…providing a gradual break to our fall. Kind of like a water slide. So that means no unicorns\" Trevor said. Well that's a better theory than mine. \"Water slide? Well that's a theory!\" Sean said and looked at me. What? I really thought that in the center of the earth there will be unicorns… \"But wouldn't the water have formed stalagmites pointing straight up at us? We'll be skewered.\" Hannah yelled. Again, thanks your optimism. \"That is also possible!\" Trevor said. We all screamed. I closed my eyes… Then felt something wet… \"IS THAT WATER?\" Wait… Water? WATER? I don't know how to swim! \"Yes it's water\" Sean started to pray? \"water slide water slide water slide\" he kept saying. \"But Trevor… I don't know how to…\" Too late… We splashed. I saw Sean and Trevor swimming I tried to copy their movements. I did everything I could but I couldn't swim… I tried… I was running out of air… Everything went dark… I woke up to a kiss. I coughed and saw Sean in front of me. Ugh! Did Sean kiss me?! I punched him on the arm. \"What's wrong with you?!\" He said confused. \"That's the same I'm asking to you!\" I snapped at him. \"So, I save your life and you hit me, nice huh?\" He said. \"You… You saved my life?\" I asked. \"Yeah I did… Don't you know how to swim?\" He asked me. \"Well thanks… No I don't\" I said. \"What happened exactly?\" I asked him. \"Well we splashed then we three got out and you didn't I splashed again saw you there… And got you out and… Uh huh…\" He said. \"What happened next?\" I asked raising a brow. I mean why when I woke up he was kissing me… \"Um, I… I gave you CPR\" he said blushing. \"Well um thanks\" I said kissing his cheek and standing up. . I looked at the ceiling; there were these blue shining things. \"Are those stars?\" I asked. \"No… It's just the cave ceiling\" Trevor said, answering my question. \"Is it just me or the cave ceiling is…\" Sean started \"Moving?\" I said. \"Yeah… It does look like it\" Trevor said. Suddenly the blue shinning things started to fly? Were they birds? \"Are they birds?\" I asked. \"Electric birds?\" Sean asked. \"They look like Cyanis rosopteryx. Only they're bioluminescent, like fireflies or glowworms. It's incredible.\" Trevor said. Indeed it was incredible. \"Have you seen these creatures before?\" Hannah asked. \"Yeah, in the museum, but they were fossilized.\" Trevor answered. \"These things have been extinct for over 150 million years.\" \"Then… How are they here?\" I asked; Trevor shrugged. \"Where are they going?\" Hannah asked, I started to follow them to this tunnel. Sean followed me. I looked around, oh my god. I saw a waterfall… a beautiful landscape… No way… Were we in the… \"Ladies and gentleman, I give you the center of the earth,\" Trevor murmured, his face just as shocked as everyone else's was. \"MAX WAS RIGHT! HE WAS RIGHT! MAX WAS RIGHT!\" Trevor yelled and laughed. Then he looked at Sean \"YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT! YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT!\" Alright we got it Trevor… \"Hannah your dad was right too\" Sean told Hannah, she didn't seem to be happy. \"They both believed…in something that everyone told them was impossible.\" Trevor said. \"HE WAS RIGHT!\" I looked at the sky… \"What's the light up there?\" I asked. \"I can't tell\" Trevor answered me. \"It must be some sort of luminescent gas combination.\" Uh huh… So that tells me nothing… I hate everything that has to do with Chemistry or whatever is that… \"It's like a terrarium\" Sean said. I raised a brow and looked at him surprised normally I was the one who knew the things… The intelligent one. \"A terrarium thousands of miles beneath the crust of the Earth.\" Trevor said nodding. \"A world within the world.\" He started to read the book as we walked \"The waterfalls, which for a long time, could be heard flowing from afar…now cascaded along the towering canyon walls…streaming along the rock with no end.\" \"It's basically what Liedenbroke wrote… Right?\" I asked. Trevor nodded. \"You read the book?\" He asked me. I nodded smiling \"Of course, it is one of my favorites\" I answered, I looked around amazed. WAIT… If it was like in the book… \"Are we saying that Liedenbrock the character was real? That he existed?\" I asked. \"Someone came down here. Someone saw all this. Someone got out and someone told Verne.\" Trevor answered. \"SOMEONE GOT OUT?\" I yelled excited. \"That's the best thing I've heard all day.\" Sean said. I agree with him. Of course! We will get out of here! Sean looked at me and chuckled, I smiled and shrugged. I don't care if he laughs at my reaction, I'm happy. We are getting out of here. I am so happy I could hug Sean, HA! Just Kidding! \"Doesn't this just completely blow your mind?\" Trevor asked Hannah blowing this flower. I smiled. \"My mind is blown yes.\" Hannah answered him. I looked at Sean, his greenish hazel eyes locked into my gray ones, I felt something in my stomach… No it's not what you are thinking, I don't feel 'butterflies' when I see Sean, maybe it is something else… I looked away. We kept walking and saw this GIANT MUSHROOMS! Mushrooms! I love fungi; it reminds me of Mario Bros, my favorite videogame. \"Enormous fossilized mushrooms.\" Trevor explained. I smiled and started to hum Mario Bro's theme song. \"Sort of like enormous fungus?\" Sean joked, I chuckled with sarcasm. He smiled at me… Again I felt something in my tummy, No Alyssa, it's nothing… You are just being stupid, it's just Sean…The cute and handsome Sean, No! STOP! I kept walking shaking my head…Wait everything seems to be like in the book… \"Uhm Trevor, as everything is like the book… I mean the good things… The dangerous things are real too right?\" I asked Trevor. \"I was thinking 'bout the same\" He answered me. I bit my lip. We all kept walking without saying a word. We suddenly bumped into this… Tree house? Sean and I smiled to each other and ran inside of it. Woah… Maybe Liedenbrok lived on here. I looked around and saw a hammock. I laid on it. \"Trevor! Come here quick!\" Sean yelled. \"Sean? Alyssa?\" Trevor and Hannah yelled at the same time. \"Someone actually lived on here!?\" Sean asked me, I smiled. \"I think that someone was Liedenbroke\" I told him. \"Look at everything he was a genius, he managed to live on here and…Oh look here\" I told him pointing at all the notes that were on the table. I stood up and start looking at them. We kept reading the notes and stuff. Trevor joined us. \"Look Trevor, think I've found Liedenbroke's notebook!\" I said giving him this notebook. He looked at it and raised a brow. \"Um… I don't think this is Liedenbroke's handwriting.\" Trevor answered and got the Journey to the Center of the Earth book. He opened it and compared the handwritings from the notebook and the book. They were exactly the same… That meant… Max lived on here!Sean's dad lived on here! Maybe he was alive somewhere looking for food or something. Hannah called Trevor and he went outside to talk with her. I smiled… Wait… He could be dead too… I frowned. I looked at Sean who was as shocked as me… I grimaced and sighed. Sean sat on the hammock, I sat beside him. He covered his face with his hands. \"Finally I found where my father is\" He said, I looked at him. \"Um, Sean, Alyssa?\" Trevor called us. I stood up, and so did Sean, we got out of the tree house and went to the beach. Then we saw him… Max. He was dead. Sean started to cry and hugged Trevor. We buried max near the sea with some rocks Sean was sobbing; I cried too, Uncle Max was dead… He wasn't really my uncle but… Whatever, I felt bad. Sean let Trevor go, he was crying. I walked to him and patted his shoulder. He looked at me with his red and puffy eyes. I sighed and hugged him tight, he hugged me back. I rubbed his back. \"I never really got a chance to know him. I mean, I wish I did.\" He said; we were still hugging. I felt as if I wanted to freeze this moment and stay like this forever. Trevor tapped Sean's shoulder and we finally let go. I knew we were friends again. Trevor had a paper in his hand and started reading it \"August 14, 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday. Six weeks ago, I promised myself I would be home in time… to give him his first baseball glove. Now I'm worried…that I'll never get the chance. I set out to make an incredible discovery to share with Trevor and the world. But now, I would trade it all…just to be able to watch you grow up to be the brave and caring man…I am certain you will become. Happy birthday Sean. I love you. Daddy\" Sean started to cry again. I rubbed his back, and now he was the one who hugged me. I hugged him back and he cried on my shoulder, even if he was taller than me. After what seemed like hours he let me go. He walked near the sea and sat down beside him. We both stared at the sea for a while. I played with a pluck of my red hair, when I noticed Sean was staring at me. \"Thanks\" He said. I raised a brow. \"For being here with me\" I shrugged. \"What are friends for?\" I said. He smiled. \"So now we are friends\" He simply said. \"Well I suppose we aren't.. I mean if you don't\" I started but he cut me off. \"Of course I want to be friends with you\" I smiled… Something in those words reminded me…. *FLASHBACK* \"Alyssa Evans! Come here and give me my shoe!\" A boy said. I giggled climbing tree. I looked down and Sean was there with one shoe and his other bare foot. \"What if I don't Anderson?\" I said with a smirk. \"Then forget about us!\" He said. \"Us?\" I asked. \"Yeah… Our friendship!\" he said. \"Oh so our friendship will end because of your shoe?\" \"Yup… Guess you don't want to be friends with me!\" He said. I sighed and climbed down. \"Well…Of course I want to be friends with you….\" I gave him his shoe. Happy?\" \"Yes… But there is one more thing I'd like to do…\" He said and kissed me on the lips. My eyes widened. \"And what was that for?\" I asked. He just smirked and walked away. \"Earth calling Alyssa\" Sean said waving his hand in front of my face. \"Wha-What? Oh right…\" I shook my head. \"Everything okay?\" He asked me. \"Um yeah... just let's got back in the tree house.\" I said. He raised a brow and nodded. We stood up and got into the tree house. I wonder if he still remembers that day, the day he kissed me…Of course he doesn't… Forget it Alyssa, it's Sean Anderson. \"According to Max's journal… we're here in this giant air pocket that's surrounded by lava. And during periods of intense seismic activity. The magma that surrounds us...turns this place into pretty much just a big oven\" Trevor said when Sean and I got in. I sat on the hammock and listened to them. \"So that's what happened to my dad?\" Sean asked. Trevor and Hannah glanced at each other. I rolled my eyes and stood up. \"Look we know we are just kids but that doesn't mean we can't handle this\" I said, and Sean nodded. \"Max was planning an escape. His notes say that temperatures down here can easily hit 200 degrees. A human being can't survive beyond 135.\" Trevor said. \"It's already 95 degrees.\" Hannah said. \"It was 82 when we got here.\" Trevor said. \" Temperature's rising quickly… And It is getting really hot…\" I said. I waved my hand in front of my face so I could get a bit of 'cold' air. \" So, what do we do?\" Sean asked,I looked at Trevor and Hannah. \"I say that we follow Max's plan.\" Trevor said laying Max's notebook in the table. A/N: Tadaaah! That was it... REVIEW! Hmm... Any ideas?[Chapter 5] A/N: Aww thanks Hyejin13570! I really do appreciate it! And yes I hate cheesy stories! I want more like hate/love. Oh and thanks also to eastern-tennis1621! So here's the fourth chapter... I worte a bit in Sean's POV... Sorry if it is a bit cheesy :P I don't own anything but Alyssa. So… yes. I'm friends with Sean Anderson, again. I'm just happy with it. Don't get me wrong but I missed his friendship, I know we've just been friends like for 15 minutes… So what? \"Here's what he wrote: 'my analysis of the original Verne text…leads me to believe that across the ocean due north of my current position…is a geyser-like river which could be used to return to the surface.'\" Hannah said reading Max's notebook. I nodded and looked at the window… \"Basically we need to get across the ocean and find the geyser?\" I asked. Trevor nodded yes. \"And then just hitch a ride topside.\" He said. I grinned \"Sounds good.\" \"It's a little trickier than that\" Trevor said. True… How the hell were we going to get across the Ocean? \"It could get so hot that the water will evaporate.\" Hannah said. I looked at everyone. \"And how much time do we have?\" Sean asked. \"Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops. Probably less\" Trevor answer. \"Uh huh... So the question here is… How are we going to get across the ocean?\" I said and looked at them. \"And fast…\" Sean thought for a while and then got the book out in the page with a drawing of a raft. \"It's all in the book\" He said I smiled. OH god… This is getting hot… Really hot! I had cut my pants into shorts, and my legs had been getting tanner, I didn't care though…I needed to get tanner. My red her was tied in a ponytail. I sighed as I was tidying on another branch to the raft. We finally tied on the last couple branches to our raft. We all looked at it. \"I'm hungry\" Sean said. Hell yes so I was. \"Hannah do you have something in your backpack?\" I asked. She nodded and gave Sean and I a bar. We sat down on the sand. I cut it in two pieces; I gave one to Sean and started to nibble on my half. God this was heaven. I was really hungry. Sean looked at me and chuckled. \"What?\" I asked. \"I missed this\" He said… He missed me eating? I raised a brow. \"I mean like being with you without fighting or you hitting me or… Stuff you know the normal\" He said. Oh… Now I understand. I sighed and nodded. \"I guess I did too… But who says I won't hit you anymore?\" I said with a smirk, I slightly punched him in the arm and he chuckled. \"Kids still hungry?\" Trevor asked us. YES! I nodded quickly. \"Well then it's your lucky day!\" He said… Lucky? LUCKY?! WE WERE IN THE FREAKING CENTER OF THE EARTH! \"I found some trilobite!\" Trevor said… He found some what? Sean and I glanced at each other… Not knowing what trilibilotility or whatever it was. \"Here have some\" He said giving us this strange hmm… Pudding. Ew… It looked disgusting. \"Er…I'm not hungry anymore thanks\" I said making a disgusted face. Sean did the same as I did. \"Eat it Sean you will be strong, while Miss 'I just want salad thank you' will be weak.\" Trevor said with a smirk and trying to imitate my voice. I glared at him but then chuckled at Sean's widen eyes. \"You want me to eat this?\" Sean said. I chuckled. \"Yes so you can be as strong as your silly uncle!\" I said teasingly. Sean sighed and started to eat the trilibilotility( OR WHATEVER IT WAS! ) I chuckled, he seemed as if he was going to throw up. So did I… watching someone eating that… Just ugh ew! \"Want some 'sweetie'?\" He said. \"You seem hungry\" I shook my head and stood up. I looked at the finished raft and then realized something… \"Don't we need to set our mast?\" I asked. Trevor shook his head. \"Nope. We don't need it. The wind that we want is way up there. Thermal. It's a lot faster than what we got down here.\" He said. I nodded, still not understanding. I walked and sat near the raft. SEAN'S POV I looked at Alyssa walking and sitting near the raft. I smiled looking at her, her read hair was beautiful…Wait no, I looked away. I can't think anything more than being friends with her. I lost her friendship once by trying to be more than friends. I don't want to lose her friendship again. \"Hey Sean\" Trevor called me, I looked at him and he gave me a compass. \"What's this?\" I asked. \"It's a compass. It was your dad's. I remember the Christmas that your mom gave it to him. She wanted to make sure that he could always find a way back home. And maybe it will help you find a way back to her.\" He told me, I grabbed it and looked at it. \"Thanks Trevor\" I said. \"You got it\" He told me. I looked at Alyssa again, she was talking with Hannah. Trevor nudged me playfully. \"You like her don't you?\" He asked me with a smirk. Yes, I do, ever since I first met her. \"No!\" I said. \"You do!\" He said. I rolled my eyes. \"And if I did, it wouldn't matter because she doesn't like me\" I told him and sighed. \"How do you know?\" He asked me. I shrugged and stood up and started to walk away. I looked at the compass. \"Oh there is one more thing you should know\" Trevor told me I turned around and looked at him raising a brow. \"Down here, the polarity is reversed. I mean, north is south, south is north… and we need to bear due north across the sea.\" He told me. \"You mean south?\" I asked him. \"Exactly\" He said. I was going to walk to Alyssa but then remembered she was talking with Hannah. I sat on the sand. ALYSSA'S POV I looked at the sea and sighed. I hope we get out of here. Otherwise my mom will kill me. Hannah came up with me and sat beside me. I raised a brow. \"Hey\" She said. \"Hey\" I answered. \"What's the problem?\" She asked me. Oh if you haven't noticed we are trapped in the Center of the Earth! \"Hmm Nothing… Why do you ask? I said. \"You seem a bit down, normally you are teasing Sean or smiling, or laughing\" She said. Woah… Even if we barely knew each other and she did know me. \"Well I'm just a bit tired and want to get out of here\" I simply said. She sighed \"Same here\" She said with her Icelandic accent. \"I mean I do like it in here it is beautiful but still\" I said she nodded. \"True. Hey what's going between you and Sean?\" She said smirking. \"We are just friends… Well we just got back to be friends\" I said chuckling. \"Hmm… You seem to like him\" She said. My eyes widen. WHAT? \"I don't like Sean. I seriously don't like Sean. He would be the last person I would date\" I lied. I kinda did like him… Woah the hot weather is affecting me. Me… liking Sean? Pfft! Ha! Yes, the hot weather is affecting me. \"Uh huh… And he seems to like you too\" She said with a smirk and stood up . Wait… Sean likes me? Ha… The hot weather is affecting Hannah too. I chuckled lightly and stood up. \"Hey guys let's go!\" Soon we had the sail tied on and it shot up as the wind violently took it into the air pulling all four of us into the water. \"It's just a little storm, isn't a big deal!\" Trevor yelled in assurance as the waves chopped, sea water spraying everywhere. It was pouring down rain and the sky was a blackish purple color with the frequent exception of fork- shaped lightening which flashed through the sky, brightening it all up for half a second. The thunder rumbled on and on like a thousand slamming doors. Hannah moved toward the side of the boat, drenched by the freezing rain. I took this chance to catch some rain in my mouth to quench my thirst. God I was thirsty. And this storm was scaring me… Sure it did… I looked at the sea and saw something moving. \"There's something moving down there!\" I said looking at it. Sean leaned and look at it. \"Probably just plankton! Same thing we saw back at the beach!\" Trevor yelled. I looked at it and raised a brow. \"I don't know it looks a bit… bigger\" I said. Sean nodded. \"Yes for being plankton it looks kinda big\" Sean said. \"Sean, Alyssa we're not at Sea World, so just back up a little!\" ordered Trevor. Pity, I loved Shamu. \"I think it's some sort of fish!\" Sean yelled; I nodded. He suddenly jumped back. I screamed seeing the fish; it was hardly a fish. It was more like a humungous silvery giant with translucent eyes and knives for teeth. My eyes widened. Some sort of piranhas. The 'piranhas' were jumping all over the raft. I was scared. The fish were splashing all around. \"Sean, Alyssa!\" Trevor yelled. \"No Trevor, I don't care about the freaking names of this fish! I just want to get rid of them!\" I said. \"No! Well their actual name it's…\" Trevor started \"NO!\" Sean and I yelled at the same time. \"Do you guys remember I told you we'd get to the batting cage?\" Trevor said giving Sean and I two large sticks. Sean and I started to whack every fish. A fish was going to bite me but Sean smacked it. We chuckled \"HOME RUN!\" I yelled he smiled. I heard a beeping noise…. Was that a phone? Sean pulled his phone out of his pocket. \"Hello? Mom? Mom I can't hear you…uh…Uncle Trevor, Ally and I are sort of on a fishing trip…\" he said. I giggled, \"Extreme fishing.\" I coughed and he cracked a smile. \"And uh…uh…um…\" I followed his gaze and saw he was staring at Hannah's butt. I rolled my eyes… Wait… A FISH! A FISH WAS GOING TO EAT HANNAH'S BUTT! I smacked the fish before it could do anything. \"Alyssa just caught a big one… Yeah you want to talk with her but she is a bit busy…\" Sean said still talking with his mother. Yes I was busy smacking fish. I shook my head and took his phone. \"Hello Elizabeth\" I said. Sean now whacking the fish. \"Hey Ally, how are you doing?\" She asked me… I rolled my eyes. I'm horrible in the center of the earth trying to survive to this fish. \"Hmm Fine…\" I said. \"I have bad news\" She said sadly. So do I. Your son almost died… \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Your… Your mom is… at the hospital\" She said… My eyes widened. No… That can't just be… No \"Wha…what?... Er I'm sorry Elizabeth I need to hang…\" I started but a fish eat the phone. \"My phone!\" Sean yelled. I was still shocked. My mom was okay… Maybe I heard wrong.. Yes I heard wrong… She is okay, she isn't at the hospital… I know… She…\"SEAN! LOOK OUT!\" I yelled. \"I got- ahhhhh!\" He screamed as the massive fish snake came out of the water we backed up on the raft. It bit at Sean's legs and I pulled him away towards Trevor and me. Wait a minute-it bit at the fish! Suddenly more snakes came out of the water, \"Look they want the fish not us!\" Trevor yelled. \"Sean, Alyssa you take the tailor, we'll take the front. Hannah, hold the slack!\" He yelled. Sean and I went to the back while the Hannah and Trevor were at the front. \"Sean, Alyssa, you wanna take us hard starboard?\" Trevor yelled. WHAT? \"WHAT?\" Sean and I yelled at the same time. \"That way.\" Trevor yelled pointing to the left. \"Now, Hannah, just let it out gently, gently.\" He said to Hannah, who held the rope. \"It's working!\" I shouted, grinning. \"You're the man, uncle Trev!\" \"That's what I've been trying to tell the scientific community for years!\" Trevor said. Sean and I laughed but then quickly stopped as the sail was jerked forward. Hannah suddenly fell back. \"Hannah!\" Trevor yelled, coming to the back of the boat where Hannah landed. I winced seeing her bleeding hands from the rope burn. I started to fly off the boat with the sail, Sean grabbed the other rope trying to help me… The rope… something happened and Sean and I were flying. I screamed. I somehow managed to get closer to Sean and took his hand. \"ALYSSA! SEAN!\" Trevor yelled. \"DON'T LET GO!\" No, duh. Sean wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I closed my eyes as we were flying. A/N: TADAAAAH! That was it.. What do you think? BY THE WAY! I AM PLANNING TO WRITE A SEQUEL! -Minnie :3[Chapter 6] A/N: YES! I'M WRITTING A SEQUEL! It will be placed after Journey 2... As if Journey 2 did happen... Well you will see! Aww thanks! Seriously I've been really motivated to write! Happy writing ;) So tadaah here is the sixt chapter... I hope you like it... -Minnie :3 I woke up and looked around. Where am I? There is one of those fish in there. Right I am here in the center of the earth. I stood up and looked at myself, nothing happened but a little cut in my knee. I looked at the salted water and washed my cut. It hurt but it helped. I looked around again... Sean? Where's Sean?! \"SEAN!\" I yelled multiple times. No answer. I started to walk in the beach, then I saw him, he was still unconscious, I ran over to him, I kneeled beside him and saw blood in his shirt. I sighed, and cautiously lifted his shirt... Holly six pack... Alyssa! Don't think about... Whatever. I saw he was injured near the left hip bone. It was bleeding, and bleeding. What should I do?! Sean started to stretch. I looked at him worried. \"Sean? Are you okay?\" I asked him. He started to open his hazel eyes. I needed to do something quickly. I placed my hand in the injury... Don't think about the awkwardness about this. Just don't Alyssa. Sean started to moan. \"It's going to be okay Sean I swear. It's going to be okay\" I said, he gasped. \"It's going to be okay... We just need to cover it with something\" I said. \"Alyssa... I'm\" he started \"it's going to be okay Sean I swear... I'm here for you\" I said. \"But I'm... \" he said I cut him off again \"I know! I'm doing the best\" I said trying to stop the bleeding. I tarted to rip one of my short sleeves and placed it on the wound. I remembered the salt water... I went running and grabbed some water with my hands. I came back to Sean running. I splashed the water on the wound. Sean moaned. \"I know it hurts Sean but you will be fine!\" I said. \"But Alyssa...\" \"I know! I'm doing my best!\" I told him \"But I'm okay!\" He yelled at me. \"No you are not okay you are freaking bleeding! You are hallucinating!\" I told him still trying to heal the wound. Even if the position of the wound (near the left hip bone) I kept going for water and wetting the wound. Sean kept saying he was okay. I didn't care and kept ringing water and splashing it on the wound, it is an old trick, it actually works but as I have little hands I couldn't bring much water. \"Alyssa! \" Sean yelled at me. Now he was obviously going to say he was okay... \"What!?\" I yelled at him before be could say anything. \"Listen to me\" he said calmly and grabbed my hand that was stoping the blood, it wasn't bleeding anymore thought. He placed my hand on his face. What the...? \"I'm better now, now I'm seriously okay\" he said making my hand rub his face. \"Look at it. it is not bleeding\" he told me, I sighed. Finally he was okay. We stared at each other for a while. My hand still on his face. I know what you are thinking, any other girl would've kissed him, but I wasn't that type of girl. I sighed and pulled my hand. \"We need to get going kiddo, we need to find Trevor and Hannah\" I said standing up, I know... Way to ruin the moment. I took his hand and pulled him so he can stand up. I looked at his perfect hazel eyes. Yes now I accept it, his eyes were the most beautiful thing I've ever saw. I let go his hand and started to walk. God I was thirsty. Suddenly a little blue electric bird came flying. \"Hey little guy\" Sean said. I looked at the bird that now was laying on my shoulder. I smiled and looked at it. \"Hey do you know... Any place with water? Drinkable water? \" I asked to the bird. I know stupid huh? Me talking to a bird... Maybe the hot was really affecting me. For my surprise the bird started to fly and Sean and I followed it. It lead us to some rocks that splashed water…Water? WATER! I leaned closer and drank some water of my hands. God. I was thirsty. Wait… Sean. \"Kiddo, clean your wound with this water\" I told him. He raised a brow. \"Do it\" I said with a glare, he kneeled and did as I said. \"Wait… I need to put something in your wound\" I told him, and kneeled beside him. I dig in my pocket and got my handkerchief out of it, yes I still had it. I wetted the handkerchief with the cold water and cleaned the wound, I know I've done that many times, but Sean didn't really clean himself, he just got it wet. The cut semmed better right now. \"Better?\" I asked him; he nodded with a smile. \"Yes, thanks Dr. Alyssa\" He said chuckling. \"Well you are welcome my patient Mr. Anderson\" I said and chuckled. He stood up and looked at me confused. \"What?\" I asked. \"Nothing you are just… Being weird\" He told me. Being weird? Hmm maybe because I… Wait… Weird? I raised a brow. \"Yeah… You are just being really polite\" He told me. \"Well I guess because we are back to be friends?\" I said shrugging. \"Wait… do you want me to me rude?\" I asked with a smirk. He shook his head. \"I thought that. Come on, let's get going. I want to get out of this crazy place as soon as possible\" I said and started to walk. He got a compass out of his pocket, I looked at it curiously. \"Where did you get it from?\" I asked him he looked at me and smiled. \"It was my father's\" He said. I smiled. \"So where do we need to go kiddo?\" I asked him. He bit his lip. \"Great, the compass says north and the river is in the south, we are going in the right way\" He said. I raised a brow… Was he drunk or something? \"No! That's not great! We are going on the wrong way!\" I said and turned around. Sean took my wrist and pulled me. \"The polarity here is reversed\" He told me… Right. How could I forget? \"Oh then… let's…\" Sean walked in front of me looking around. Suddenly I saw his pocket knife floating… Wait… HIS POCKET KNIFE FLOATING? HE HAS A POCKET KNIFE? WHAT? Wait… It is floating?! I grabbed the knife form the air when Sean turned around. He looked at me… I guess he thought I was going to stab him or something. I chuckled at his widen eyes. \"Look at this\" I told him releasing the knife as it started to float. \"Woah… I guess anti-gravity?\" He asked me. I rolled my eyes. \"If it was antigravity we would be floating too\" I told him. I smirked, I was the intelligent one again. \"Right then it is something like wooshy hooshy?\" He said waving his hands. I chuckled and shook my head. \"Silly kiddo, no it's more like something magnetic…Like magnetic rocks… \" I told him he raised a brow, and we both looked at the floating rocks in front of us. \"Sometimes your intelligence scares me\" He said. I chuckled. \"Now the question is how the hell are we going to the other side?\" He asked. Well we could like jump…. \"Hmm let's jump… Like you jump to this rock then to the other and then I jump on this rock and so and so\" I told him, he paled. \"What? You scared kiddo?\" I asked him, he nodded. \"Don't worry everything will be okay, I swear.\" I told him, he bit his lip and sighed. \"Um… In case I die… I want you to er…\" He started to mumble. I raised a brow. \"I'm sorry\" He continued. \"For what?\" I asked clearly confused. \"You know what I mean… After Valentine's day…\" I looked at him confused then… Now I know… He meant after he obviously stopped to talking to me… After that kiss… After the shoe. \"It doesn't matter kiddo… You are just a kid\" I said maybe I looked hurt because he looked down. Then I saw a little smirk upon his lips. \"What?\" I asked. \"Well as I'm going to die…\" He started. \"You are not going to die\" I cut him off. \"Well normally when the guy is going to die, the girl kisses him\" He said with a smirk. He wanted me to kiss him? Is he insane?! I rolled my eyes. \"And normally the girl kisses a man not a kiddo, and if the girl does kiss him, he actually dies… So get going kiddo\" I told him with a smirk. He sighed and pulled me into a hug. I awkwardly hugged him back at the beginning, but then realized that this could be the last time I could hug him so I did hug him and really tight. I tried to let him go but he kept hugging me. \"Er… Sean\" I started but Sean cut me off \"Shh! Don't ruin the moment!\" \"Sean we need to get going!\" I yelled at him. He let me go and turned around. I sighed \"Alright… Just in case…\" I said and kissed his cheek. He stood for a moment dumbfounded with a big smile I smiled at his reaction) and jumped over to the rocks. I looked at him worried. He did it okay. \"Now jump to the next one… carefully\" I told him he nodded and jumped. I sighed, my turn. I took a deep breath and jumped to the rock. I did it! Now… the next. Sean jumped into the next one… I jumped… Sean jumped again… And finally stood up on the floor. Something happened to the rock next to me and it floated far away from me. I bit my lip. Sean yelled \"NOOOOOO!\" I almost fell but before I did hugged the rock. I gulped. \"NOW WHAT KIDDO?!\" I asked… Well yelled at him. \"I don't know you are the intelligent one!\" He yelled. \"I let you be the intelligent one for once… Now what?\" I looked at him. \"Er… Paddle?\" Seriously? I sighed and started to paddle with my arms… It was working… Suddenly the rock was doing a 360° degree flip. I gripped tighter. I closed my eyes then her a little 'thud' I opened my eyes and saw I arrived at the floor. I jumped off the rock and hugged Sean. I was barely breathing, I rested my head on his chest and felt his breath. I heard his heart beat going quickly. \"I thought I was going to lose you\" He said. I was still shivering. \"You are not getting rid of me that simple\" I said he chuckled lightly. I let him go and looked at his hazel eyes. \"Let's get going kiddo\" I told him, he cracked a smile. I looked around and saw the blue electric bird flying around us. \"Try it without wings\" Sean said sarcastically. I smiled. We started to walk on. \"I wished I've read that book\" He said. \"You should…You will love it\" I told him \"Guess I will…Now let's look for Trevor and Hannah\" \"TREVOR!\" I yelled. \"HANNAH\" Sean yelled. \"UNICORNS!\" I yelled higher. Sean looked at me raising a brow. I chuckled. \"What? I want a unicorn! Maybe there is a unicorn somewhere around here\" I said, he laughed. \"You love unicorns don't you?\" He asked me smiling. \"Yup… When I get my unicorn I'll name him Pony\" I said. He chuckled. \"Pony? You will name your unicorn pony?\" He asked me laughing. \"YUS! And I will name my puma Roxy… And my T-Rex Rexy!\" I said with a giggle. \"Uh huh and where will you find a T-Rex?\" He asked me. I shrugged. Suddenly his question was answered with a growl. We turned around… A t-Rex-… A real one… And I swear it wasn't my green t-rex Rexy, this was a real one. a/n:sorry if it was short... BUt nothign really happens... SO did you like it? Want more Sean's POV? -minnie[Chapter 7] A/N: AWW THANKS :3 Yes! UNICORNS! So in this chapter happens what I think everyone was expecting. The next I will write I will write the end... And A bit of the sequel. Oh oh oh... For the sequel THIS IS THE SUMMARy so you can get an idea: '\"To the earth to the moon? Seriously grandpa?\" I asked my grandfather. Kailani chuckled and looked at us in disbelief. I heard a knock on the door. I went and opened it. Trevor and Hannah. I raised a brow... Where's Alyssa?' That's the summary... Well here it is chapter... 7. hope you like it. I DONT OWN ANYTHING! But Alyssa :D SEAN'S POV \"When I get my unicorn, I will name him Pony\" She said, I chuckled. I love the way she says and does things and doesn't care what other people say about her, she is just incredible. \"Pony? You will name your unicorn pony?\" I asked her laughing. That is really cute. \"YUS! And I will name my puma Roxy… And my T-Rex Rexy!\" She said with a giggle, wow really original with the t-rex. \"Uh huh and where will you find a T-Rex?\" I asked her. She shrugged. Well when I get out of here I'll buy her a stuffed t-rex. I heard a growl. We turned around… There was a t- rex coming for us. Alyssa's eyes widened, she was in shock. I grabbed her hand and started to run. We hid behind a rock. Alyssa started to shiver. I pulled her closer. She looked at me, I looked at her beautiful gray eyes. I wrapped my arm around her shoulder. We heard big footsteps, my heart beat went faster, Alyssa hugged me.I hugged her back, she was shivering. I rubbed her back. Our hug was interrupted by… Spittle? We looked above us and saw the t-rex. We started to run, the t-rex behind us. We kept running the faster than we could. \"OVER THERE! THERE'S A CAVE! LET'S GO IN THERE!\" Alyssa yelled pointing at a cave on the walls. We ran over and got in it. The tyrannosaurus was trying to break the walls. \"Alyssa... If we die…\" I started to say. \"What?!\" she asked. \"We are not going to die Sean, I swear, not today\" She said. Always, really optimistic. \"If we do die I wanted you to know… That I've liked you since the first day we met!\" I told her. I did want her to know what I felt for her. I blushed; the t-rex was growling trying to eat us. I looked at Alyssa. Alyssa stared at me and then kissed me, my eyes widened in shock… Then… the wall broke… Trevor. Alyssa and I pulled away. Trevor smirked, seeing us kissing. He hugged us. \"I was never that happy to see you both of you\" He told us. \"Ally, go that way, Hannah is there… Sean and I will take care of the Rex\" Trevor said pointing in a random direction . Alyssa hesitated for a bit but nodded. She kissed my cheek and started to run in the direction Trevor told her to. Trevor and I started to run when the t-rex broke all the wall. It started to follow us. We kept running. ALYSSA'S POV I kissed him, if I was ging to die, at least I was going to die kissing Sean. He said he likes me… I like him too. The wall broke and Trevor was standing there, Sean and I pulled away from the kiss. I was blushing. Trevor had a little smirk. He hugged us. \"I was never that happy to see you both of you\" Trevor told us. I chuckled lightly, yes I was happy to see him \"Ally, go that way …Hannah is there… Sean and I will take care of the Rex\" Trevor said pointing in a random direction. I bit my lip, leaving Sean? I sighed and nodded. I kissed Sean's cheek and ran in the direction Trevor told me to. I arrived in this cave. Hannah was there. \"Alyssa! You are alive!\" She said and hugged me. I hugged her back. \"Yes I am\" I said letting her go. \"Where are Sean and Trevor?\" She asked me. \"Er… Dealing with a T-Rex. But I'm sure they will come back\" I told her. She gave me my backpack. I looked at the river. \"The water is boiling there is no way we cross this\" I told her, she bit her lip. I looked around… We started to walk looking for something… Nothing the water was boiling everywhere and there was no bridge or something. I looked around and saw a mini-horse (it was as tiny as my thumb) in the floor. I looked at it and kneeled to see it… A unicorn! A mini-unicorn! OMG! I grabbed it and laid it on my hand. It started to walk over it. I smiled. I opened my backpack and grabbed my bottle of water, I drank the rest of the water and let my little unicorn to enter. Yes… I was going to take it to me. I didn't close the bottle so my mini unicorn could breathe. I put the bottle back in my backpack. I closed the backpack and stood up. Hannah and I kept walking looking for something to cross the river. Ding! I saw a t-rex skull. \"How about hmm a boat?\" I asked her. She smiled and nodded. \"We need some er… rowing oar.\" I said. We looked around a saw 2 bone. Hannah grabbed one for her and one for me. We got in our new boat and started to row. We saw Sean and Trevor. \"So… Who had dibs again?\" Hannah asked with a smirk. Trevor and Sean pointed to each other and chuckled. Trevor and Sean got in the skull. \"Sorry for the delay... But some people decided to be romantic\" Trevor said and looked at Sean and me with a smirk. Sean and I chuckled blushing. Hannah and I started to row. I felt a jock knock. I raised a brow. We four looked at each other. \"It's the river bed\" Trevor said and the boat rocked some more. \"You might want to hold on.\" he advised. \"Hey… When we get out of here I'm so going in a date with you\" Sean whispered in my ear. I raised a brow. \"What if I don't accept it?\" I said with a smirk. Of course I will I just wanted to like tease. He curved his lip. I sat near Sean, who was deeply thinking, well… If he does think. The boat rocked more, throwing us about until it flew from the river bed and flew down into a large pit. I screamed. The skull came to a sudden halt, I accidentally hit Sean's arm. We all groaned as we sat up. I stood up to look over the edge, lava. \"Think we missed the geyser Trevor\" I said biting my lip. \"Why do you say that?\" Sean asked me. \"There is no water… We need water and lava for a geyser…\" I told him. He nodded, guess he didn't understand. I laid on the wall thinking, the water wetted my shirt. Wait… WAIT… WAIT… THE WATER? \"TREVOR! THE WALLS ARE STILL WET\" I yelled they all looked at me. \"That's impossible\" He said. \" it's a hundred and thirty degrees down here.\" Trevor argued. \"Look at the damn wall! IT IS WET! AND COLD!\" I yelled at him and he touched the wall. I looked down. \"Guys! It is coming closer! We need to hurry up!\" I said. \"Hey, magnesium.\"I said looking at the wall, the skull jolted and I stumbled over to the side. \"Guy's we're slipping.\" Sean warned. \"Sean… Flare!\" I told him. He raised a brow. \"Give me a flare!\" He opened Hannah's backpack and threw a flare at me. I caught it. \"Trevor listen to me. Now you are going to light it up… On purpose!\" I said and gave Trevor the flare. Trevor nodded, and lighted up the flare. He tried to lit up the wall… But it was too wet it didn't. I gave him another flare, and he tried again… It failed again. I bit my lip. \"It's over… We won't get out of here\" Sean said. \"Oh no no no no! We WILL get out of here!\" I said. \"I swear we'll get out of here… And then I'll go in that date with you kiddo\" I told Sean. His eyes brightened and got out another flare. I gave it to Trevor. \"You need to go down there… And well… Lit it\" I told him. \"Down..?\" He asked in shock. I nodded. \"Alright hold my legs\" Sean held out the last one and Trevor looked scared. \"You are going to have to tie my legs. It's the only way I can get down far enough.\" Trevor said. I looked down \"It's so close now! Hurry! I don't want to be fried!\" I yelled. Trevor was lowered over the edge and lit the flare. Pressing it against the wall he shook his head. I didn't understand why it wasn't working. I looked across at the other side of the wall and noticed that there appeared to be magnesium there as well. \"Trevor! The other side! Throw it!\" I yelled at him, he nodded as started to count and tossed it on three. A spark! Yes! NOO! IT DISSAPEARED! I sighed. \"Damn… Well I guess… WAIT! LOOK! ITS LIT ITS LIT!\" I yelled. \"Pull me up!\" Trevor yelled and looked down at the lava oozing up towards him. \"Pull me up!\" Trevor yelled multiple times. We started to pull him. Trevor fell over the edge. The water started to emerge from the wall and we four were lying down at the skull. We all started to scream when the geyser pulled us upward. I looked up… I saw a blue… \"Is that the sky?\" I asked. We looked at the blue sky up ahead through the opening. We screamed again as we cascaded up and burst out of the hole. \"Hang on!\" Trevor shouted. \"Trust me, I'm hanging on!\" I said sarcastically. The skull touched the ground of the mountain and we were zipping through fields of fruits? GRAPES?! They were soon jolted to a stop by a loud boom as they crashed into a wall. I stood up and looked behind me… A volcano… It was barely familiar. I looked around at all the grapes. I ate one. \"Sean… Ally if your moms ask… I took you to Italy okay?\" Trevor said. We all chuckled. I looked at the house we crashed in. An Italian farmer was there with a kind of root waving his hands. \"La mia vita è rovinata ... come faccio a sostenere me e la mia famiglia?\"He said. I raised a brow with a smirk. I opened Sean's backapack and took out one diamond. \"Hey! That's mine\" Sean said. I winked at him. \"Er… Scusa… I am really sorry. But well hmm you can have this. And we are really sorry! ci dispiace!\" I said giving him the diamond. The farmer's eyes widened, he gave me the root, taking the diamond. I looked at the root and shrugged. \"Sean… Alyssa\" Trevor said opening our backpacks, which were full of diamonds. \"What… I just took a few samples…Okay. What do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.\" Sean said. Trevor , Hannah and Sean looked at me waiting for an explanation \"What? I'm an ambitious girl!\" I simply said. And now I'm the one I want who wants a Maserati. The farmer hugged the diamond. Sean walked closer to me. \"You slide again?\" The farmer said, we all chuckled. \"No, thanks. We are fine\" I told him, then the farmer smiled. I raised a brow and discovered Hannah and Trevor in a passionate kiss. \"Ew\" Sean and I said at the same time. \"Disgusting\" I said chuckling, when they pulled away Trevor looked at us. \"Hey, I didn't do disgusted noises when you guys were kissing.\" Trevor said. I blushed and looked at the ground. Sean wrapped his arm around my shoulder, lift my chin and leaned to kiss me. I placed my index finger on his lips before he could kiss me. He raised a brow. \"What? I thought…\" He started. I chuckled. \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\" I said cutting him off. \"That means that that kiss…\" \"It was a goodbye kiss. I mean I thought we were going to die\" I said. \"So… that was a goodbye kiss?\" He asked me, I nodded. He smirked \" Well then hello\" He said with a smirk and kissed me. I smiled and kissed him back. \"Ew!\" Hannah and Trevor said at the same time laughing. \"Guess… That date will be in Italy\" Sean said. I raised a brow. He pulled me closer \"I love you\" he whispered in my ear. EEEP HE LOVES ME! EEEP \"I love you too\" I whispered and kissed him on the cheek. I didnt lie, I did love him, ever since he kissed me in Valentine's day. He smiled. A/N: TADAAAH! Only one chapter left! EEP I'M EXCITED! So.. yes she has a unicorn.. A MINI UNICORN! Hope you liked it... Are you excited for the sequel? - Minnie :3[Chapter 8] A/N: TADAAAH! Here it is... The last chapter. God I'm sad it's ending. I had so much fun writting this story. But... When a door closes, another one opens! :3 At the end is the link for the sequel... I DON'T OWN ANYTHING BUT ALYSSA! BTW... The song is Shakira's I just wanted to write it... \"Ally… I'm so sorry\" Elizabeth said getting out of the room. I raised a brow. We were in the hospital; my mom had a heart attack… After she crashed the car. Sean held my hand. Sean, Trevor, Hannah and I were sitting outside the room my mom was staying in. I squeezed Sean's hand. \"How is she? Can I go in there?!\" I asked. Elizabeth bit her lip and nodded. I sighed letting Sean's hand go. I went in the room. My mom was on the bed with lots of hospital thingies. I sat on the chair next to her. She grabbed my hand. \"Alyssa\" She said. I started to cry. \"Mom you are going to be okay… I swear, everything's going to be alright.\" I told her, she shook her head. \"Alyssa, promise me something\" She said in a delicate voice. \"What is it mom?\" I asked her. She wiped my tears away. \"Never, forget who you really are\" She said and rubbed my hand. \"I won't mom. I promise. But you will be okay\" She smiled slightly and shook her head. \"Alyssa… Don't forget this… The most stupid thing a girl can do is dumb herself for a guy.\" She said. What did that mean? I nodded. \"I love you Alyssa\" She told me with a smile. \"I love you too\" I said. She closed her eyes, the beeping noise that is always beeping when your heart is beating stopped. I cried, sobbed. The doctors entered to the room and started to check my mom. A nurse came and got me out of the room. I cried; Trevor was there outside. I hugged him tight. He hugged me back. I let him go. Sean came and hugged me, I hugged him back. I cried on his shoulder. He kissed my forehead. I kept crying. \"I'm sorry we can't do anything\" I doctor said coming out of the hospital's room. I cried even more than possible. \"You know I still don't get why you chose to stay with Trevor\" Sean said. I chuckled. \"Oh so you want me to stay with you? \" I asked him and he chuckled. He wrapped his arm around my waist. \"Yes, that would be perfect \" He said kissing my cheek. \"It's just six months, then I'll go with you. As long as you have a room for me\" I said. \"Why not sharing?\" He said. I punched him in the arm. \"That. That's the reason of my I didn't choose to stay with my kiddo\" I said. \"Oh well. At least you are coming. But certainly I would prefer to have you all the time.\" He said. I smiled and kissed his cheek. \"It's not like if you won't see me anymore kiddo\" Trevor and Hannah came out of our new house… Sean and I helped them a bit with our little fortune. \"Okay lovebirds, we have presents for you\" Trevor said. I raised a brow and smiled. He gave me a book 'The island of the lost dreams' ((A/N: IT DOESN'T EXIST, I INVENTED IT! IT'S FOR THE SEQUEL! ;) )) I looked at it and then saw Sean's book. 'The lost city of Atlantis'. \"Thanks Trev.\" I said. He smirked and looked at Hannah. \"Oh Sean, I have a present for you too\" I said and got a little box with holes. He took it and opened it. His eyes widened. I smiled. \"Say hello to Pony\" I told him. \"No way. Alyssa seriously. This is yours\" He said giving it back to me. I shook my head. \"It's something so you can remember me.\" He smiled and chuckled. \"So… What does little Pony eat?\" He asked me. \"Rainbows!\" I told him with a chuckle. \"No, seriously he eats grass and drinks milk\" I told him. He smiled and nodded. \"Well hello, little Pony\" Sean got his stuff in the trunk, and then kneeled beside his backpack… Putting some… Seeds? I raised a brow. \"What's in there?\" I asked him. He smirked. \"Well I also have a present\" He said. Is this the present time or something? I smiled as he opened his backpack. The electric blue bird was there; it flew and posed on my shoulder. I smiled. \"Hey little guy\" I said. But then it flew away. \"Hey come back here! Please! I have seeds! Hey come back!\" Sean started to yell. I chuckled. I smiled. *SEQUEL PROLOGUE* \"Sean, stop! Please! Stop\" I said between giggles. Sean was tickling me. We were outside his house in the garden. People who were walking outside looked at us with weird faces. What? We are just two sixteen years old playing outside! Is it wrong to have fun with your boyfriend? \"Sean stop. Please! What do you want me to do?\" I asked still laughing. He smirked. Now I knew what that meant. I kissed him, he kissed me back wrapping his arms around my waist. We kissed for what it seemed for hours… Then I heard a beeping noise. I raised a brow and pulled away from Sean. I took my iPhone out, Louis. I smiled, he is my best friend. I answered the phone. \"LOOOUUUIIIIIS!\" I yelled with a smile on my face. Sean crossed his arms, clenched his jaw and looked away. I rolled my eyes, I hate when he is jealous. \"Aleesee! Hey wanna come and watch some movies?\" Louis said in the phone… \"Sorry I can't. I'm at Canada at the moment! But I'm coming back on Thursday, so what about Friday?\" I asked him. Sean rolled his eyes. \"Okie dokie. OOOOH… Canada? With Sean? Well then… Behave.\" He said. I chuckled. \"Alright bye Loo!\" I said. \"Bye bye Lyssie\" He said and I hanged up the phone. I had a smile on my face, Louis always cheers me up. I looked at Sean, who was still with his perfect jaw clenched. \"You finished? Can we continue?\" He said with a monotone voice. \"Oh come on. Not again, you know that Loo and I are just friends!\" I said and kissed his cheek. He rolled his eyes. \"How come you have a nickname for him, and not for me that I'm your boyfriend since three years ago\" He said. \"Because I love your name, just the way it is. And I didn't know that you wanted a nickname\" I told him, and wrapped my arms around him. He scowled and looked away. I rolled my eyes. That's stupid getting mad because I don't have a nickname for him? And perhaps… I don't know any nickname for Sean. \"Alright er…I'll call you hmm… 'S'? You know your name is too short for a nickname… Er… Sean-Sean? No? Alright… Er… Sean Poo?\" I said. He laughed. Sean poo… It sounded a bit like Shampoo! I laughed. He tickled me again, I leaned to kiss him but… I heard a beeping noise again. I looked at my phone, Kevin. Shit, again Sean will be jealous again. \"'Sup, Kev-Kev?\" I said answering my phone. Sean leaned to hear what they say. \"Hey Lyssie, hey you think you could come tomorrow to my house and help me with maths? \" Kevin asked me. \"Sorry, I can't I'm here in Canada. What about Saturday?\" I said, and looked at Sean, he clenched his jaw again. \"Alright Lyssie, so see you on Saturday! Bye bye!\" Kevin said. I smiled. \"Buh-bye!\" I said and hanged up the phone. \"I'm sorry… It's cause you know I give math classes and..\" I started he cut me off kissing me, I smiled and kissed him back. \"That was for reminding you that you are MY girlfriend, and I'm YOUR boyfriend.\" He said. I grinned and poked his cheek. \"And why would I forget that?\" I asked. \"Well… I don't know… You and your friends, who are obviously hotter than me and you spend more time with them than with me\" He said. I rolled my eyes. \"Sean, we've been through this before, and you know there is nothing between them and me.\" I told him. \"And they are not 'hotter' than you\" I added. \"Alyssa, seriously you deserve someone better than me. I mean look at yourself. Why would you date someone like me?\" He said. I felt my eyes starting to water. He was right why would I date someone like him? Him being a handsome, nice, and kind guy… And me just a normal nerd girl. \"You are right… Why would you date someone like me?\" I said starting to cry. \"No. Alyssa I didn't mean that\" He said and grabbed my wrist. \"No Sean, I perfectly understood what you mean. This is over, I'm tired of every single time we see each other, is fight after fight. This is over.\" I said and stormed off to his house. I went to his room and started to pack my things. I looked at all the pictures he had of us. I rolled my eyes, and grabbed all my stuff. I closed my suitcase and walked to the door, I bumped into Sean. \"Alyssa, please don't be\" He started. \"Don't be what? You know just… Get out of my way!\" I yelled at him. I know I love him, but I'm just tired, him being jealous of me having friends is just stupid. He leaned and kissed me, normally it would work, but this time I was really mad. I didn't kiss him back. \"Alyssa. Please. Just\" He started. \"No Sean, I said it's over. Now get off my way so I can go\" I said cutting him off again. He looked at me with his hazel eyes, which were starting to water. I scowled and pushed him off my way. This wasn't the first time we fought, but I swear It's going to be the last one. I went downstairs, Elizabeth looked at me raising a brow. \"Is everything okay?\" She asked me. I shook my head. \"Elizabeth. Can you please drive me to the airport?\" I asked her. She nodded; and drove me to the airport. I cried when I got in the car. I took out my iPod, put in on shuffle mode and started to listen to music. Great, just great. Is my iPod against me? I mean, first Payphone (Maroon 5); Rolling in the Deep, Set fire to the rain (Adele); Illegal, Dreams for Plans, and… The day and the time (Shakira). Yes my iPod is against me. I started to sing with The day and the time… Who's to say that we always have to agree I think we both can take this one mistake Like some kind of amnesty Who to love and with such brutality? We're compatible Maybe a bit too much That's our ambiguity I've cried a thousand storms I've blown away the clouds The heartbeat of the sun is racing mine And listen how My heart is waiting This is the day and the time I wanna believe we may still have a chance We took a leap in the dark And I can see now How shadows have turned to light Well, we know how ephemeral are things Disillusion takes what illusion gives What's the use of make believe? The needles of the clock are moving right to left Pretend we never heard of things we said Like we've been dead and start all over This is the day and the time I wanna believe That we may still have a chance We took a leap in the dark And I can see now How shadows have turned to light, oh The heartbeat of the sun is racing mine I'm missing out, oh This is the day and the time I wanna believe That we may still have a chance We took a leap in the dark And I can see now But shadows have turned to light Ah, the time Ah, oh, ooh, ooh Ah, ah, ah, ooh, oh We arrived to the airport and I took the first flight back to New York. a/n: So...

Or do I own anything associated with it. Kay? Let's get on with it then. -I hate the \"word for word\" thing people tend to do when writing this fanfiction. In the \"begining\" it might seem a bit like I will be doing that... but I mean how many greetings can you have when opening the door? Also, I am raising the ages a bit for this story to make everything seem more realistic. I'll let you know the ages within the story eventually, however I will not tell you now! Let the story begin. Chapter One The blonde woman sat at the table wrapped in her knitted robe. A steaming cup of tea was clutched tightly in her grasp and she closed her light blue eyes slowly to ease her tension. Loud speakers blasted from the room upstairs invading her eardrums. She did not understand how her life had come to this... Her baby girl used to be sweet, innocent, and love spending time with mommy. Over the years the young child turned into something arrogant, blunt, and obnoxiously loud. Like her father. Taking a sip of the liquid she almost spilled the entire drink all over herself as a knock sounded from the front door. A frown graced her pale lips as she stood slowly. Who would be here at this time of night? She tried to look through the little eyehole in the door however she could not make out any of the faces. All she knew was that there were two figures standing there, \"Halló, hver er það?\" \"I'm sorry! I don't speak Icelandic!\" a voice called from behind the door. Opening it carefully she peered out at two men, one older and the other significantly younger. Although, you could see that they had some sort of resemblance to them. \"How can I help you?\" There was a silence that followed as the older man looked quite surprised to see the golden haired beauty standing before him. His jaw slacked and his mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. \"... Hello,\" he managed to choke out. \"I'm Hannah,\" the woman introduced as she held out her hand respectably. The man grabbed her hand gently, \"Oh hi, um, I'm Trev- Professor Anderson. I'm traveling from America... This is my nephew Sean-\" \"- hey,\" the younger male interrupted as he waved with a hazy smile on his lips. \"I'm looking for Sigurbjorn Ásgeirsson...\" Hannah looked down sadly, \"I am sorry. He is dead.\" \"Dead?\" Sean questioned shocked as he shared a look with his uncle. They traveled all this way for the man to be dead? Really? \"Three winters ago...\" Hannah bit her lip. She had loved her father to bits. It was a difficult subject to bring up and she hardly ever talked about it. The idea of explaining it to a stranger did not appeal to her in any way, shape, or form. \"Do you run the institute?\" She shook her head, \"No. There is no institute.\" The Professor pointed behind him, \"But there was a sign out there that says that-\" \"- It failed,\" she raised her eyebrows causing the man to realize what she meant by failed. Studying volcanic activity did have its consequences. \"Oh...\" he sighed scratching the back of his head. \"Did you work for him?\" \"No, he was my father,\" Hannah informed slightly smiling. \"Would you like to come in?\" \"Yeah,\" Sean rubbed his arms realizing how cold it was outside at this time of year. She opened the doorway more and the two male's entered the home, \"How about some tea? Or hot chocolate?\" Sean grinned, \"I will take some hot chocolate.\" \"Water is fine for me,\" the Professor sat at the table. Hannah started bustling around the kitchen readying why the two men situated themselves in the awkward situation. \"Here you go Professor Anderson,\" she set the glass of water down at the table in front of him. \"You can call me Trevor.\" She smiled softly before returning to steaming the milk. The distant sound of the music coming from the stairs reminded her of the younger female in the house. She was half tempted to roll her eyes, but felt it would put her on the same level as her daughter so decided against it. \"So what brings you all out here at this time of night looking for a dead man?\" Hannah questioned as she took a seat beside Trevor at the small round table. Trevor started digging through a brown leather satchel. He pulled out the book Journey to the Center the Earth lying it on the table for her to see. Nodding her head she touched the cover of the book and frowned knowing exactly what that book meant to her father, \"Yes, I know it... What about it?\" \"This book belonged to my brother Max, Max Anderson. In it there are some notes and one of them was your fathers name... We believe he may have been in contact with him about, I don't know, something important,\" he explained as he flipped through the pages of the book to show her where her fathers name was scribbled on the side. \"Your brother was a Vernian then?\" \"Vernian?\" Trevor looked at her questionably. \"No... he was an explorer of sorts.\" \"What's a Vernian?\" asked Sean as he took a sip of his hot chocolate. \"A Vernian is that who believes that the writings of Jules Verne were scientific fact,\" Hannah responded with a chuckle. She thought how much her father believed in the writings to be quite silly. \"The guy was a science fiction writer. Yet, some people thought that his writings were real and set out to find 'the center of the earth,' my father was the biggest Vernian of them all. He based his life work on that book.\" Trevor grimaced, \"My brother was no Vernian .\" Hannah grabbed the book and flipped through the pages. She eyed Trevor determinedly then walked over to the bookshelf that took up most of the wall in the living room. Glancing past the titles of the old books she stopped when she found her own fathers copy of Journey to the Center the Earth . Slipping it off the dusty shelf she plopped it down on the table beside Max Anderson's copy. \"This was my fathers,\" she flipped it open to a page to show some of the doodles he made on the side. She pushed it closer to Trevor. \"Look through it.\" He picked it up and started flipping through pages. He stopped on one and Hannah picked up Max's copy and turned it to the same page holding it up beside her fathers, \"See. Your brother definitely was a Vernian. This is probably how he knew my father.\" Sean leant back in his seat from where had been previously leaning over his uncle's shoulder, \"My dad was kind of...\" he scowled, \"out there.\" His uncle snapped his head towards the younger man, \"Don't say that. You didn't know him like I did.\" \"I'm starting to think-\" he took the book from Hannah's hands and stared down at the pages. \"-that you didn't know him as well as you thought you did, either.\" Hannah sighed, \"What are you two doing here?\" \"I'm a scientist,\" insisted Trevor with raised eyebrows. \"And a professor. There is some seismic activity going on around here and we thought we should check it out.\" She gave him a strange look as she motioned to Sean who was engrossed in his book, \"With a kid?\" Trevor shrugged his shoulders unsure of how to answer her question. Okay, so it had not been his smartest move, but he didn't know how to take care of kids. \"There are no roads North of here. How do you intend on getting up there?\" Once again, Trevor looked defeated and without a response. \"I'm a mountain guide, how about I take you up there?\" Sean's ears perked at this and he nodded his head feverishly. The conversation was interrupted by footsteps coming down the stairs, \"Mom, who are you talking to?\" All heads turned to see a petite brunette walk into the room clad in matching black pajama shorts and tank with a black silk robe untied over her shoulders. She stopped cautiously as she eyed the three in the kitchen sipping on their drinks while the books were resting in their laps. \"Hi?\" the girl greeted looking in her mothers direction for a clue. \"It's kind of late for company isn't it?\" Hannah waved her into the room, \"This is my daughter Emmie. Dear, this is Trevor and Sean. They are here about some seismic activity coming from up in the mountains. They were looking for your grandfather.\" She nodded her head, \"Alright.\" \"It's nice to meet you!\" Sean stood from his seat and held out his hand with a dreamy grin stretched along his lips. It was just his luck that he was surrounded by beautiful woman on his trip. Thank God I made Trevor take me on this 'adventure.' \"My names Sean.\" \"Yeah,\" she shook his hand. She backed away from him and tied the robe around her waist. It did nothing to shield her legs from the cold as it ended mid thigh, but it was much chillier downstairs than up in her room. \"So, you were saying something about mountain guiding?\" Her mother nodded, \"As I was saying, I would be willing to take you up there if you would like?\" \"That's a great idea,\" Trevor smiled widely. Sean glanced at the girl before him then her mother, \"I love idea.\" Trevor shook his head and once again said, \"That's a great idea.\" Standing, Hannah picked up her father's book and brought it over to the shelf, \"Then it will by five thousand.\" \"A day? Yeah that's reasonable,\" Trevor accepted, he thought about how much money he had in his bank account and knew he could cover up to fifteen grand. \"An hour,\" said Hannah in an offended tone. Trevor looked at her like she had a plague, but Sean answered for his uncle, \"Do you accept rolls of quarters?\" \"I want to go too,\" inputted Emmie as she placed her hands on her hips. Hannah eyed her daughter warily, \"I am not sure if that is a good idea.\" \"What are you talking about mom?\" she rolled her eyes. \"Why else would you buy me hiking gear for my birthday if you didn't expect me to use it?\" \"Then it's settled!\" Sean slapped his hand together happily. \"We hike up to the mountains tomorrow!\" Sighing, Hannah shot her daughter a worried glance. The teenager could be a handful. Not to mention, she did not show much of her mother or father's adventurous spirit. She probably just was so bored of being at the cabin that she had nothing else to do but go mountain climbing with her mom. \"We leave tomorrow at noon.\" What do you think? :3[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: I love Journey to the Center of the Earth, but I do not own it. Or do I own anything associated with it. Kay? Let's get on with it then. Chapter Two \" Mom , how much longer?\" Hannah glowered ahead at the rocks. \"My feet hurt.\" She glanced to her right to see her daughter a few steps behind her, \"About a half hour. I thought you wanted to come?\" \"I didn't think we were climbing up the entire mountain!\" Emmie exclaimed unhappily. The girl turned to see that the American duo were far behind her mother and her. \"Mom, they are so slow. We would make it there faster if they hurried up.\" They both paused to see both men stumbling to stay on their feet. Putting a hand to her mouth Hannah shouted, \"Hurry up! I want to make it home before sundown.\" The mother and daughter turned back around and returned to their hiking. Hannah was actually quite proud of her daughter. The young woman did not even seem out of breath as she paced beside her. Other than her nagging, which she figured she did just because she wanted to be annoying, Emmie was being surprisingly graceful compared to her usually clumsy self. \"Ahh!\" Emmie tripped over a rock and landed on her knees. She got back up and dusted herself off muttering curses under her breath. Hannah sighed, well at least she isn't tripping as much as she normally does . Lower down the mountain, Trevor and Sean eyed the two females as they gave them their backs and started climbing higher up the mountain. They both saw the way Hannah's butt stuck out of her tight spandex pants as she reached up to climb over a larger boulder that clogged their path. Sean smirked, \"Dibs.\" \"Dibs? You want dibs at a time like this?\" Trevor questioned. \"Not the candy,\" Sean rolled his caramel eyes. \"I mean I call dibs on the mountain guide.\" \"You are fifteen. You don't get dibs.\" He shrugged his shoulders, \"Get over it. I'm cougar meat.\" \"I wonder if she's married,\" Trevor stared at the woman way ahead of him curiously. \"It didn't look like anyone lived in there other than her. I didn't even realize there was someone else in the house.\" \"I heard music coming from upstairs,\" Sean pursed his lips as they finally reached the large boulder. Gripping the top he pulled himself up and kicked off the rock to get over it. \"I wonder how much longer until we get there,\" muttered Trevor after he lifted himself over the rock. He looked back down and shivered at the path down. It looked more dangerous than going up the mountain. When they made it over the boulder they found Hannah and Emmie waiting for them. The older of the two pointed towards a group of rocks, \"Be careful there. Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous. And very slippery at times.\" \"Mount Sneffels?\" Sean questioned. \"Why don't you explain that to him, Professor?\" \"Mount Sneffels is the mountain that the fictional character in the book found a portal to the center of the earth,\" Trevor answered shrugging his shoulders. \" Finally !\" Emmie placed her hands on her knees and panted as she let herself rest for a moment. The shinny metal object was planted a distance away from her and she never thought she would be happy to see such an insignificant object. Well, insignificant to her. Her mother looked back to see Trevor and Sean only a few minutes down. She shook her head. From how they had been so eager to come up the mountain she was surprised by how little energy they had. She would have thought with the adventurous spirit they had shown to come all the way out to see her father would have meant their physical actives would allow them much more movement. Trevor bonded over to the metal object poking out from the ground without stopping to take a breath. He got on his knees before it and attempted to yank it from the ground. \" This is what we climbed all the way up here for?\" Emmie pointed at the object with a scowl. \"It has recorded all the seismic activity from the past years,\" explained Trevor as he was able to yank it a little more. \"It is worth much more than it looks.\" She sighed, \"I guess you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.\" \"Trevor...\" Emmie glanced towards her mom to see her staring intently upward. A gust of wind swept her hair burgundy waves around her face making her realize how the atmosphere had changed. Dark clouds surrounded above their heads making her eyes to widen at the once baby blue sky. \"Trevor, you need to hurry,\" urged Hannah as she started to casually move away from the metal object. Her mother had been mountain climbing enough times to know when it was time to get going. Storms were worse higher up than down below. Hannah grabbed her daughters shoulder and started pushing her in the direction of a cave, \"I am sorry! But there is no time to-\" a bolt of lightening struck close by causing a streak of purple to encased them. \"- we need to go. Sean, come on!\" Hesitantly, Emmie started walking away from the older man who was still on the floor tugging on that stupid metal object. Lightening had started to pick up even more around them. Hannah tugged on her arm trying to pull her to go faster. But when a strike hit close by Trevor something inside the younger female snapped. She couldn't let him die. Wrenching her arm out of her mother's grasp she sprinted back to Trevor. They both tugged the metal piece up due to her adrenaline rush and his combined. When a lightening struck right beside them the duo started running with all their might towards the cave where Hannah and Sean stood. \"Come on! Faster!\" Hannah screamed ready to sprint back out herself and slap her daughter for doing something so terribly brave. Sean's heart raced as one lightening hit right between Trevor and Emmie's feet, \"Drop the stupid thing!\" \"It's attracting the lightening!\" screamed Hannah when she noticed this. \"Let it go,\" Emmie let out an ear piercing scream as a flash struck even closer to her body. \"Now! Or I swear if this lightening doesn't kill us I'll kill you with my bare hands!\" Trevor reluctantly let the metal piece soar behind him and lightening instantly hit it causing it to shatter into bits and pieces. They made it to the cave just as lightening hit the entrance erupting them in an earth shattering collapse. Screams followed as rubble fell upon the four burying them in dust and rock. A deafening silence followed. \"Mom...\" Emmie coughed when she inhaled layers of dust. She pushed rock and dirt off the bottom half of her legs. Shuffling started beside her, which she figured was Trevor considering he had been blasted alongside her when they entered the cave. \"I'm right here. Are you okay?\" answered Hannah from across the room. Taking out a flashlight she clicked it on and scanned the area until she found Emmie kneeling on the ground breathing heavily. Emmie was gently pulled to her feet and she discovered Sean was the one who helped her up. He looked her over quickly then moved onto helping Trevor up. Then it seemed as if a panic settled over him as he stared at the barricaded cave entrance. Or, what used to be the entrance. Taking handfuls of rocks and shoving heavy boulders out of the way he started to breathe heavily, \"Help me dig! Come on. What are you all standing around waiting for?\" Trevor joined his nephew, but after moving a couple rocks let his arms drop to his sides defeated. There were too many... \"Forget it,\" Hannah muttered. Sean whirled around glaring at the golden haired woman \"Forget it? What do you mean forget it?\" \"We are buried too deep in. It would be best to find another way out,\" she examined the blockade with a sigh. \"She is right, it would take us about a month to dig our way out,\" Trevor agreed as he moved away from the rocks. Sean started breathing heavily as Hannah began to dig through her bag to hand out flashlights and brown miner hats. With shaky hands Sean put the hat on is head and turned on the light. The action caused his heavy breathing to become short and raspy as his caramel eyes finally were able to see the mess that the lightening created. His uncle placed a hand on his shoulder, \"Don't worry Sean. I will get you out of here, promise.\" The younger male nodded his head trying to assure himself that his uncle would indeed be able to get him home safe... to Canada. Maybe dying didn't sound too bad compared to the thought of moving to a different country. As Emmie secured the miner hat atop her dirty hair she caught sight of her mothers once bright orange jacket. She was covered in so much dust that the jacket almost appeared gray. With a frown she wiped sweat from her brow and when she looked down at her hand she saw all the dust that covered her entire body. With a disgusted grunt she started to attempt and dust herself off. \"What else do you have in there?\" Trevor gestured to Hannah's bag as he grabbed a flashlight. \"Rope, blanket, signal flares, first aide, and some protein bars,\" the woman shook her head disappointed that she had not been thoughtful enough to bring any more supplies. \"We will have to ration the food. It's not enough to last more than a week.\" \"I brought some purifying tablets for water,\" inputted Emmie is she took her pack of her back. Her father told her that she should always carry some with her whether she was going for a walk in the forest or going camping for the weekend. \"Not that there appears to be water down here... at least not much of it.\" Hannah smiled gratefully, \"Good. We don't know how long we will be trapped down here for?\" This caused Sean's panic to resurface, \"Trapped? Trapped ?\" \"Don't worry,\" Emmie stuck her chin up. \"With me here there is no way we can't escape! I'm a good luck charm.\" Taking out his cell phone he held it up and started waving it around wildly, \"I am not getting any service! Oh God, check your phones guys!\" Emmie rolled her eyes, \"We aren't going to get any service in the mountains. Trust me, I've been trying to all the way up here.\" \"Sean, we will make it out of here,\" Trevor reassured him once more. \"I promise, remember?\" \"Yeah...\" he swallowed loudly. \"Then let's get going!\" the young girl held her flashlight high in the air. \"I don't want to be stuck down here any longer than I need to be. Besides, look at me? I'm covered in dirt. I call shower first when we get back.\" They all started walking down the path quietly. Trevor lead, Sean followed after him, Emmie next, and Hannah brought up the rear. There was so much tension in the air someone could probably cut through it with a knife. Growing bored Emmie quizzed, \"So... where are you guys from?\" \"New York,\" Trevor answered breathlessly. \"Oh? That's interesting,\" she mused. \"What about you?\" Sean added glancing back at her briefly. \"You don't sound Icelandic.\" \"My dad's an explorer,\" her mother snorted, but she ignored her. \"My grandparents lived in the states so a majority of my time was spent there when my dad would go off on his adventures.\" \"Why didn't you live here?\" \"In this cave?\" Emmie joked. \"Because mom was young. She didn't really have the means to take care of me on her own.\" Hannah bit her lip, \"Not that I didn't want her.\" \"I know you did mom,\" Emmie smiled back at her mom. The conversation ended when they found a fork in the rode. Hannah pointed a light at each doorway and thought long and hard on which one might be the best choice. \"How do we know which one to take?\" asked Sean, the panic lacing his voice once more. \"My gut says we go right,\" Trevor responded and started in that direction. Following behind him, Trevor started talking about how direction was his six sense. Also, how he enjoyed field work. Emmie was half-tempted to snort. The guy was the biggest nerd on the planet. She figured field work to him was something like digging rocks from his fenced in backyard with the dog running around behind him. Hannah pushed Emmie aside as she saw the gaping hole before them. Screaming \"watch out\" she gripped onto the back of Trevor's grimy jacket and tugged him back. All you could hear was Sean's breathing and Hannah shoving Trevor into the wall. \"This isn't your lab Professor!\" she mocked gazing up into his light blue eyes. \"This is real. You have to be on your guard because you can die.\" Moving away from him she stared down. She shined her light into the blackened pit, but could not see the bottom by doing so. Picking up a rusted sign of the ground, Trevor handed it to Hannah, \"What does this say?\" \"Halda út,\" she read as she took it from his hands. \"It means keep out. This is good.\" \"Good?\" Sean asked surprised. \"How is that good? It's saying keep out. Maybe we should take it's advice.\" \"Or you could always ignore it,\" Emmie pointed downward. \"It probably isn't even that deep.\" Sean looked back at her, \"If I can't see the bottom then that means it's deep.\" \"Give me one of those flares,\" Trevor requested with a hand motion towards Hannah. She opened her bag and pulled out one handing it to him. Then she began to slide off her jacket and stuff it into her pack. \"Sean, hold out your hand.\" He did as told and Trevor pointed at his watch, \"I am going to drop the flare. I want you to count how many seconds pass until it reaches the ground.\" Emmie copied her mother and started tugging off the black jacket she wore as Trevor lit the flare. He started pointing it upwards and counting, but as he straightened his arm out the flame touched the wall and sent off sparks and explosions through the cave. She felt something ram into her and knock her into the ground, which she found difficulty maneuvering around considering she had her arm behind her back from attempting to take off the jacket. When the bursts of explosions ceased she found Sean on top of her looking around the cave wide eyed. He seemed to be too engrossed into what happened to realize the compromising position he had insinuated. \"What was that?\" Hannah was leaning on her elbows eyeing Trevor warily. The man stood from where he had fallen to the floor and touched the ceiling. He sniffed his fingers and frowned, \"Magnesium. It must run through the walls.\" \"Magnesium is kind of... flammable.. Professor, isn't it?\" Hannah chuckled as she started to lift herself up. Trevor nodded with a smile and motioned around them, \"Yeah. It's used in gun powder, matchsticks...\" Emmie pushed Sean's chest roughly and he rolled over beside her. A blush tinted his cheeks, but was hardly visible underneath all the grime that covered his face. He hadn't realized that he had been pressed on top of her body, breathing heavily, and with her legs spread out so he was nestled snug between her. She finished pulling off her jacket and Sean stood moving beside his uncle embarrassedly. \"Maybe flares aren't the best idea then,\" Hannah started going through her pack and pulled out an orange glow stick. Trevor held it towards Sean, \"It's the same principal, got it?\" He rolled his eyes. It wasn't like he was five. \"Three, two, one-\" Trevor released the glow stick into the hole. Sean began counting instantly, \"One... two... thr-\" Thud . \"Almost three.\" \"Two thousand feet,\" Trevor calculated looking back at Hannah. \"Approximately.\" Sean raised his eyebrows, \"That's like... a huge building.\" \"Twenty story high rise,\" he laughed. \"I have rope,\" Hannah started taking the thick string from her bag. \"Enough of it?\" Trevor asked as he saw her pulling even more out. He wondered how she fit it all in there. \"I always have enough rope,\" Hannah informed giving him a pointed stare. \"You aren't suggesting we go down there,\" Sean walked closer to the edge and motioned towards it. \"We are going to rappel down,\" his uncle answered. \"Down into that deep dark hole?\" Sean scoffed. Trevor smirked, \"Is that a problem?\" \"Pft,\" he waved his hand pretending he wasn't afraid when he saw Emmie giving him an amused grin. Hannah started situating the rope and Sean let his facade slide off. \"There is no way I am rappelling down there.\" \"Your man enough to call dibs on the mountain guide,\" Trevor smugly said with raised eyebrows. \"But not man enough to climb down a dark hole?\" Emmie snorted. \"Guys!\" Hannah interrupted with a frown. \"No one calls dibs on the mountain guide.\" Trevor and Sean both turned crimson, however, it was a bit more visible this time from how dark their cheeks became. \"Okay...\" said mountain guide stood with the rope in her hand. \"Are we ready?\" So, the story is sticking to some more of the actual script from the movie than I intended. But once I get more into the actual \"center of the earth\" part it will be more original. BECAUSE they happened to be there for quite a bit of time, but it was shown in some flashes so you don't see anything else that happened down there. I got a reviewer! Thank you so much! I honestly wasn't sure how many reviews, if I'd get any at all, on this story because Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't that popular YET. Just wait, as soon as it comes out in theaters there are going to be TONS of stories on here popping up.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Pulling tightly to secure the rope one final time Hannah smiled at Sean comfortingly, \"Ready Sean?\" \"Why are we doing this again?\" Sean asked with worry lacing every word. His hands fumbled shakily with the rope tied around his body making sure they were all extremely tight. Hannah chuckled, \"If we don't then we will be stuck in this cave forever. This is our only option.\" \"What about the other path?\" he pleaded with a frown. \"It would probably end up taking us the same way Sean,\" Hannah patted his shoulder gently. \"Don't worry. We are all connected.\" \"Are you guys coming down here?\" Trevor asked up towards the two that were talking on the edge. Emmie and him were half-way down the hole already without much effort. Although, Emmie seemed to slip a bit more than Trevor. \"It's pretty great down here...\" Sean gulped. \" Way down here.\" Leaning over the edge he started to ease himself down with Hannah's help, \"Alright Sean. I'm going to start lowering you down slowly. Stay calm and keep your grip tight and footing careful. Try not to slip.\" Trevor looked up at his nephew and snickered at the frightened expression on his face. \"Lean back Sean,\" Hannah ordered as she started to let herself fall beside him. \"We are all connected so nothing is going to happen, okay?\" He exhaled shakily, \"Sure.\" \" Baby ...\" Emmie muttered under her breath. Just as she said it her footing slipped and she had to grab hard onto a sharp rock. She cursed loudly and her mother shook her head at her daughter. Sean heard the mocking comment and shot her a scowl. \"You're looking pretty good up there,\" Trevor said as he slid down with ease. \"Are you sure you haven't done this before?\" \"Shut it,\" Sean grumbled closing his eyes. The fact that every one was doing this better than him was starting to make him afraid and very intimidated. Not to mention pretty helpless. He couldn't even fend for himself. He kicked some rocks with his foot and they bounced off the walls and on Trevor's head. His uncle shot him another comment, but re-focused on himself and the now pounding headache he had. \"Sean,\" Hannah said forcefully. \"Talk to me. It will make it easier.\" He swallowed loudly, \"So, Hannah, you come here often?\" Emmie scoffed, \"Really Sean? Really?\" \"Is that the best you could come up with?\" jeered Trevor. Emmie and him shared a snicker at Sean's expense while his cheeks turned a deep red. \"I'm making conversation with her!\" Sean retorted hotly. \"No Sean,\" Hannah laughed throwing her head back. \"I do not come here often.\" Trevor became intrigued with the rock, \"Hey, look at all this schist!\" \"Shit? What shit?\" Emmie questioned softly as she pulled her hand back with worry, but only saw the dirt from the rocky walls. Sean looked down, \"What?\" \"It's a metamorphic rock... Green schist, garnet schist, mica-garnet schist.\" \"Oh, schist,\" Sean looked hard at the rock as well. He had learned about it in one of his science classes at school. \"Look at it-\" Trevor went to reach over to look grab at a piece of rock, however he lost his footing. With a scream his rope pulled out and tangled around Hannah's causing her to loose her grip. Soon everyone was screaming and lost their footing. Emmie, Sean, and Hannah were able to grasp the rocky walls once more although Trevor still swung in the middle. \"Trevor I'm sorry but I am going to have to cut you loose. You are tied around my rope and you will bring us all down if I don't,\" Hannah shouted as she took a switch blade from her pocket. \"No Hannah!\" Sean screamed as he stared down at his uncle with wide worried eyes. \"Don't, don't, don't!\" Trevor begged as he attempted to grab onto the wall. Emmie attempted to reach a hand out to reach Trevor, \"Give me your hand Trevor! I think I can get you!\" The older man reached for her and their fingertips brushed just as Hannah cut the rope loose. A short thump was heard and Emmie sighed with relief as she realized Trevor was only a few feet from the ground. \"Hey guys, I found it. The bottoms right here...\" \"Oh thank God...\" she exhaled. Staring up at her mother she shot the woman a disapproving look. \"You knew the ground was there, right Hannah?\" Trevor called up wishfully. Hannah ignored him and the looks Sean and Emmie gave her as they continued their way down. When Emmie's feet touched the floor she loosened the rope and darted over to Trevor's side. He still sat on the floor trying to recuperate from falling hard on his back. \"You okay?\" she asked as she examined his dazed expression. He nodded, \"Yeah. My head is just killing me.\" Pulling her backpack around front she started going through the pockets and found her own first aid kit. She took out a couple Advil and her only water bottle handing it to the man. He thanked her quietly as he took a drink and plopped the pills into his mouth. Sean touched the ground before Hannah and came to his uncle's side. He shook his head, \"I am never doing that again.\" \"I hope you don't have to,\" Emmie smirked. \"You slow us down kiddo.\" \"I'm not a kid,\" Sean grumbled giving the smaller girl a glare. She was almost half his size and she was calling him a kid. His pride was also hurt by her comment. He already knew he was sucking at this whole adventure thing; he didn't need her to rub it in. \"He was doing rather well,\" Hannah nodded at Sean approvingly. \"For a first timer.\" Her daughter rolled her eyes and stuck out a hand to help Trevor stand on his feet. \"Do you remember your first time?\" \"Let's not talk about that right now Mom,\" she took her flashlight and moved it around the bottom of the cave stopping at an opening. \"Does that look like a mining tunnel to you guys?\" Trevor agreed, \"Yeah it sure does.\" \"Old Bla'gils Mine... it was shut down after a big disaster over sixty years ago,\" Hannah inputted as they walked closer to the tunnel. \"How big?\" Sean bit his lip nervously. \"Eighty-one dead.\" \"That's big.\" Emmie frowned, \"Well, let's get going then.\" \"Hey Trevor,\" Sean asked as they started walking. He gazed around and the stony walls amazed. If anyone told him a few hours ago what he would be doing he would have never believed them. \"Was there a mining tunnel like this in the book?\" His uncle shook his head, \"No. I don't think so.\" Emmie fell back beside Sean who had ended up picking up the rear this time. He glanced at her confusedly, but didn't say anything as they walked silently. \"I am not my father!\" Hannah shouted out. Emmie looked up at her mother to see her angrily pointing a finger at Trevor's face. She had missed the conversation as she had been spacing out staring at her surroundings. \"I loved him very much, but he was caught up in these strange fictional stories... I refuse to believe they could be real.\" She winced at her mothers words. She knew how much her grandfather's crazed obsession with the books had caused her mom to resent them and him. Emmie would never admit it to her mother, but sometimes she believed that her grandfather hadn't been a crazy old cook that everyone made him out to be. How could someone be so dedicated to something and it not be real? It just didn't seem plausible. At least... it didn't fit in her mind that someone she cared about could be making something so extreme up. Then when she was younger and came to visit her grandpa would read her the stories before bed. He would tell her all his little findings and how they fell into place. How it all made sense that it wasn't just a book. She wanted to believe for him. That is the truth to why she had decided to come along on this little adventure. Yesterday when her mother had invited the two men in she had seen them approaching from outside her bedroom window. She had snuck outside of her room to listen to the conversation and overheard the topic of her grandfather come up and the way they talked about the book... Never in her life had she been much of an adventurous person. Emmie liked boys, makeup, clothes, and hanging out with friends on the weekends. She wasn't an explorer like her dad or a mountain hiker like her mom. But when her grandfather was mentioned there was something in her gut that told her she needed to go for him . \"Do you think it's real?\" she whispered the question to Sean. Hannah was informing Trevor that he was still being billed so she knew she wouldn't overhear their conversation. He glanced at her skeptically, \"Not really. Do you?\" \"Sometimes,\" she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Gramps used to tell me stories when I was little about the book. He told me they were real and he showed me facts...\" \"I want to believe it's real,\" Sean said honestly. He gave her an unsure smile. \"I don't want to think my dad was crazy.\" They came up to a change in the ceiling length. Sean looked to his right and saw a bunch of odd wiring and machinery, \"Hey Hannah, what's that?\" \"That's an old mining generator...\" she walked up to it and started pressing buttons. A noise started and Sean backed away. \"Hannah, stop touching that,\" Trevor scolded worriedly. \"It could blow up.\" \"It might turn on the lights,\" informed Hannah ignoring Trevor's words. \"Stop flipping switches, no don't touch that!\" he stepped forward and flinched as Hannah grabbed a large handle. \"Don't do it Hannah!\" Then she pulled it up and a loud buzzing sounded. Soon after lights started to turn on one by one lightening the entire cave dimly. A gasp escaped Emmie's lips at all the tracks and tools that surrounded the place. Trevor laughed happily, \"Okay I take it back. You can touch anything you want.\" \"That's what she said,\" Emmie said under her breath. Her mother smacked her arm at hearing the comment. \"This is our way out right?\" asked Sean as he rushed up to one of the mining carts. \"They had to get the supplies somehow.\" \"Hey Hannah, how many people got out?\" Trevor muttered looking around. \"One.\" Sean hopped into the front cart, \"Well, that's a start. I call front.\" \"Me too,\" Emmie jumped into the cart beside him. He scooted over to give her room. Trevor rolled his eyes, \"Get out of there. We don't even know if they work.\" Hannah appeared on one with a lever to push the carts, \"Apparently they do.\" \"We don't know if they are safe,\" Trevor pressed mutinying ahead. \"Looks good from here,\" Sean stated with a frown. \"Just get in,\" Emmie urged. \"What else do you propose we do?\" With an annoyed sigh, Trevor hopped into the cart behind them. Hannah started pumping and eventually they sped up to a quick pace. There was silence until Sean leant forward in the cart. \"Sean, I don't think you should be doing that,\" Trevor called out parentally as his nephew leant even more out of the cart. \"I think I see something...\" he trailed off. Emmie turned her head and squinted in the distance. Her stomach knotted. \"If it's not daylight I don't want to know.\" \"No...\" Emmie breathed out loudly. \"No, it's not daylight,\" he stared back at his uncle, 'We're in deep schist.\" Happy New Years Eve you all! I hope you have a great and safe adventure into the year 2011. I know I'm probably going to be sloshed out of my mind on coke and rum with one of my greatest friends, hah. My New Years resolution is to grow my hair down to my ass. What's yours?[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Four screams erupted as the speed of the carts picked up as the tracks dropped down in a deep slope. Emmie looked back to see if her mom was okay seeing as the woman was standing with nothing surrounded her like Trevor, Sean, and herself. The woman's knuckles were white as she held on with all her strength to the bars. A lurch sent her flying forward and Sean gripped her around her upper torso to save her from falling out of the cart. Her left hand held onto the edge of the cart and the other gripped his arm tightly. \"Why aren't there any seatbelts on this thing?\" Sean screamed searching around them for something to hold them down. Trevor almost laughed, \"You are worried about seatbelts ?\" \"Oh my...\" Emmie trailed off. She shook Sean's arm and pointed up ahead where a break in the tracks occurred. \"Do you guys see that?\" \"Hannah!\" Sean yelled petrified. He could see his life flashing before his eyes. \"I know...\" the woman muttered. \"Pull the breaks,\" Trevor motioned towards the lever in the front of their cart. As Sean reached forward to pull it Hannah objected loudly, \"No! We will never make it if you do it.\" \"Then what should we do?\" Emmie could feel tears in her eyes. Turning towards her mother she saw her starting to pump the carts faster. More screams echoed as they flew over the gap and landed painfully back on the tracks. However, the action caused the carts to break apart onto three different tracks. Trevor was above them now shouting down, \"Stay put!\" Emmie would have laughed if she weren't scared out of her mind. Where did he expect her to go? A jolt to the right made Emmie fly left. Her hold on Sean's arm slipped and she was half-way out of the cart faster than she had time to register. Her scream bounced off the walls loudly. Reaching out towards the petite female, Sean wrapped his arms around her waist and tugged her back into the cart before she fell out. He panted heavily as she smashed against his chest. They both stayed like that for a moment until their cart surged downward quickly making them stumble apart. Being fed up with almost falling out of the cart Emmie sat on the floor of it. She hugged Sean's legs and buried her messy hair between his kneecaps. He would have made a joke, but knew by the fear he had that it wouldn't be funny. The cart slowly began to slow down after a few more twists and turns. She peeked her head up to see Sean staring down at her with a wide toothy smile on his face. It was the first time she had ever seen him look remotely happy... she actually thought he looked kind of cute. \"That was awesome!\" he exclaimed pumping his fists into the air. Emmie shook her head slowly gaping up at him as if he were crazed. Awesome was the last thing she thought that was. He looked over outside the cart to see his uncle and Hannah sprawled on the floor in a tangle of limbs, \"What happened to you guys?\" Trevor scowled at the delighted boy, \"Don't ask.\" \"Where's Emmie?\" Hannah sat up to see her daughter nowhere in sight.\" \"Right here,\" Emmie responded meekly. Sean held out a hand and she grabbed it pulling herself into a standing position. Feeling wobbly due to the ride she grabbed onto Sean's biceps to steady herself. \"I'm never doing that again.\" \"Hey look!\" Sean hopped out of the cart towards a hole in the wall, \"What do you think this is?\" \"Don't go in there,\" Trevor demanded. However, Sean was already inside the small opening before he finished his sentence. With a grunt he got onto his feet and followed his nephew. \"What are you talking about?\" Sean laughed. \"This could be our way out!\" Emmie climbed out of the cart and shared a look with her mom. These two were endless. \"Guys you aren't going to believe this,\" Sean touched the wall hungrily as his eyes caught a glimmer of the red crystal. \"Rubies!\" \"Emeralds,\" Hannah ran a hand over the smooth green rock. Trevor grinned, \"Feldspar.\" \"That's not it!\" Emmie rushed between them wide eyed. Her eyes glimmered as she looked back at her three companions. \"Diamonds...\" \"Crystals are frequently formed and found in volcanic tubes,\" Trevor explained as he plucked one of the diamonds from the wall. Hannah smiled, \"This tube can take us back up. Right?\" They both looked upward, \"Yes.\" Emmie was more focused on the diamonds. She grabbed a few and stuck them in the pockets of her gray spandex pants greedily. Although, a yellow Oppenheimer diamond caught her eye. She stood on the tips of her toes to reach for it, but it was too high. Giving up she turned around to see her mother watching her carefully. She started walking towards the woman while letting her fingers trail over the diamonds in the wall. Sean had noticed her trying to read the yellow diamond. He gripped it tightly between his fingers and yanked it out of the wall. He stuck it deep into his backpack so that there was no way he could lose it. \"When I get out of here I'm getting a Maserati...\" Sean said as he stuck another diamond in his pack. \"Money is not all that matters Sean. People matter too...\" Trevor looked hungrily at the flashy objects. \"... or something like that.\" Hannah sighed at the men, \"How about we try and get out of here now?\" Sean tried reaching for a higher diamond and a crack sounded, \"Did you guys hear that?\" Crack , \"Nobody move.\" They all looked towards Trevor who spread out his hands, \"Muscovite.\" \"No,\" Hannah glanced down. \"Muscovite...\" Emmie scrunched her nose. Sean eyed his uncle, \"Muscovite? What's that?\" \"Muscovite is a thin rock formation. It can break at the slightest change in weight or pressure,\" informed Trevor as he waved his hands around. \"And we are standing on a lot of it.\" Emmie readjusted the strap around her shoulder and another crack sounded. Her mother swung her hand out, \"Stop it! Don't move.\" \"We are all going to walk back the same way we came. Slowly,\" Trevor stepped backwards. \"We need to be as slow as possible.\" They all began to move at a snails pace. But Emmie saw it before anyone else. She cried out as a diamond slipped from the top of Sean's backpack. He followed her eyes and tried to reach for the diamond in time, but it was too quick. It landed directly in the middle of the muscovite causing all around it to shatter. A moment of silence followed and they could have sworn they were safe. Trevor breathed a sigh of relief and was about to start speaking when the sound of the rock splitting erupted tenfold. It shattered completely and the four screamed as they fell downward. Emmie reached out for Sean's hand and he gripped hers tightly. Her mother found Sean's other hand and Trevor's. \"What is at the bottom?\" Hannah questioned as they continued to fall after a few moments. \"If what Verne wrote was correct... then this tunnel can go on for thousands of miles,\" Trevor looked down. It sure felt like it was going to go on for thousands more. \"Well,\" she snapped. \"He wasn't right.\" \"Then, in theory, it should just end.\" Emmie cried, \"What?\" \"Any other theories?\" Sean asked giving Emmie's hand a tighter squeeze. \"Well, the walls could have eroded due to water, which could gradually break are fall.\" \"Like a water slide?\" \"Exactly like a water slide,\" he agreed. Hannah scowled, \"What if the water formed stalagmites pointing straight up at us?\" \"Oh God,\" Emmie shrieked. \"We are going to be in pieces!\" \"That is possible...\" said Trevor mournfully. \"Dude,\" Sean yelled at his uncle motion with his head towards the ballistic girl alongside him. \"Not cool.\" \"Is that water?\" Hannah released her hold on Sean's hand and let her fingers glide against the liquid. \"It is water!\" \"Water slide, water slide,\" Sean repeated under his breath clenching his eyes shut tightly as he prayed. The large body of water swallowed them. It was deep and dark in the liquid. Sean and Trevor emerged to the surface first. \"I'm not in pieces,\" Sean stated feeling himself just to make sure. \"Where's Hannah?\" Trevor looked around him. Neither Hannah or Emmie had emerged. He swam back underneath the water just as Emmie came to the surface. She coughed up fits of water and Sean reached for her pulling her on top of a rocky surface. They both laid on their backs catching their breath. Hannah and Trevor appeared not a moment later. The older woman clung to his shoulders, \"My backpack was too heavy...\" They all lay on their backs in silence. All that was heard was the sounds of rippling water and their uneven breathing as they tried to readjust themselves. \"I hate water...\" Emmie muttered softly. She let her head fall against Sean's shoulder tiredly. All she wanted to do was go to sleep. Was that so much to ask for? \"Is it just me or does the ceiling look like it's moving?\" inquired Sean. He pointed upward at the shimmering lights. \"I think they are stars...\" Hannah suggested blinking skyward. \"No,\" Sean rejected with a frown. \"It's definitely moving.\" \"Yeah...\" Emmie nodded her head. She looked at Sean's face and his eyes met hers. For the first time he realized her eyes were a grayish color. He had thought they were the same color as her moms light blue iris's. \"They are moving!\" She let herself slip away from his body and stood up. The others soon followed suit and the ceiling, or what they assumed was the ceiling, started to squawk. Then the bluish figures started to descend downwards. Emmie gasped, \"Birdies.\" \"Electric birds?\" Sean asked hesitantly. One of the feathered creatures flew towards him as if it were expecting him as well, but shot off before Sean could get a better look. \"They look like Cyanis rosopteryx..\" Trevor said as he squinted up at them. \"They are bioluminescent like glowworms.\" \"Pretty...\" Emmie tried to reach out to touch one and it sped off. They took off all at once down a long tunnel revealing a pathway. \"Look a tunnel,\" Trevor pointed out with a grin. \"Come on guys.\" They started in the direction. Trevor watched closely as a bird flew past him, \"It's insane. These birds have been extinct for over 150 million years...\" \"It's almost like-\" he stopped speaking as they made it past the pathway. A fresh breeze rolled past them causing their movements to halt. Lush green plants surrounded them. There were thousands of exotic flowers, tall trees, and there was soil beneath their feet. And then a large fiery ball was high, high up in the center of everything. Emmie almost cried at the beauty of it. \"Ladies and gentleman...\" Trevor smiled. \"I give you the center of the earth.\" AHH! We are getting more into the story. I'll let you guys in on something... I TOTALLY have the sequal planned out so if you like it plan on another ;-) Basically, I want to write this story to write the second one. BECAUSE the second one will be more focused on what I think and not be based on something prior. Ya dig?[Chapter 5] Chapter Five \"Whoa,\" Emmie breathed in the fresh grassy scent. Her hand reached out to feel the pedals of one of the large dandelions. It felt soft and fluffy; cotton like. Smiling, she bent her head down and blew against the seeds causing them to fly off into the air. \"... they both believed in something that everyone told them was impossible...\" She turned towards Trevor and laughed at the abnormally happy face he had on. Even her mother looked pleased. Maybe she was feeling relief that her father, after all this time, really wasn't as crazy as everyone made him out to be. Sure, the old man was kooky, but he was right. Sean stepped beside her and picked one of the large dandelion seeds. He released it into the sky and watched it float away, \"I can't believe it's real.\" Hannah pointed towards the bright light in the sky, \"What is that?\" \"It looks like a sun,\" Emmie commented. \"But... not at the same time.\" \"It must be some sort of gas combustion,\" muttered Trevor. He looked thoughtful as he eyed the orangeish mass in the sky. \"Like a terrarium,\" said Sean. \"A terrarium a thousand of miles beneath the earth's crust...\" the older man grinned. \"Amazing.\" Emmie furrowed her brows, \"A world...\" \"Within a world. Yes,\" Trevor started walking forward. \"The waterfalls, which for a long time, could be heard flowing from afar... now cascaded along the towering canyon walls... streaming along the rock with no end.\" \"Someone was down here before,\" raising her eyes to Trevor's he nodded in agreement. \"Gramps told me once about how he met some guy that claimed to have gone to the center of the earth. That he had shown them proof. That's why he believed in it so much.\" Her mother frowned, \"He told you that?\" \"Yeah...\" Emmie tucked a strand of hair behind her ear nervously. \"He told me a lot of things...\" Trevor raised his brows, \"Like?\" \"Well, that someone had been here and got out. That's an important thing,\" Emmie muttered frustrated that they were prying. There were some things her grandpa had discussed with her that she didn't feel the trio should know at the moment -especially Sean. \"Someone got out...\" Trevor repeated. Sean laughed, \"That's the best thing I've heard all day.\" \"We should find shelter,\" Hannah stated picking up her pace to stand beside Trevor. \"Eating and rest are our main priorities right now. We wont be able to go on much longer without it.\" \"I am starving...\" whined Sean as he placed his hand over his grumbling stomached. \"Do you think any of this stuff is edible?\" \"Maybe,\" Trevor looked at the plants around him. Hannah looked behind her at the two younger children, \"Hey look at this Trevor.\" She pulled the man to the side and luckily the teens stood back watching them oddly. Trevor motioned to the mushroom, \"That's a huge mushroom. Maybe we can eat it...\" \"Trevor, do you think everything in the book is real?\" she asked in a hushed voice. \"I'm not sure,\" he pursed his lips. \"Probably though.\" \"Even the dangerous things?\" He looked back at Sean suddenly very protective of his nephew, \"I was just thinking about that too.\" The ground seemed to shudder causing a rumbling noise to echo throughout the land. Hannah and Trevor whirled around to see both of their responsibilities looking at something excitedly. \"Hey, come here quick!\" Sean reached the tree house first. Looking back at his uncle he tilted his head upward, \"I'm going in.\" \"Me too.\" \"I wanna come!\" Emmie ran up behind Sean and followed him inside the tree. \"I'll be right back,\" Hannah called towards them. She started towards the woodsy area surrounding the quaint tree house. Her feet hit the ground as she looked for somewhere to use the bathroom. The feeling had become so extreme she could hardly hold it any longer. However the urge to use the bathroom faded when she saw something slumped over in the corner of her eye. She cautiously stepped closer to the object and gasped loudly. Bones... human bones. She kneeled beside the body and noticed that the flanges were wrapped around a metal flask. Tugging it gently out of the dead man's grasp she rubbed her fingers over the metal. Her heart clenched at the name she read... Max . \"Oh Sean...\" she whispered sadly. \"Look at this!\" Emmie held up a facial shaving razor. \"I can't believe someone lived here...\" Sean was rummaging through some bags and pulled out a journal. He flipped through the pages. \"I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.\" Trevor held out his hand and Sean gave him the leather-bound journal. The man's face turned sour, \"This isn't Liedenbrock's notebook.\" He opened his brother's copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth and placed it beside the journal. Emmie raised her eyebrows and watched as reels went off in Sean's brain. The expression was clear on his face, \"It's my dad's...\" She placed the razor back by the empty bucket carefully. The sudden overwhelming feeling of imposing became extreme. Sean had grabbed the notebook back and was flipping through the pages aggressively almost as if just glancing at the pages would answer all his questions. \"Trevor!\" her mother's voice stirred her. Trevor and her both moved towards the large gap in the tree house to see Hannah's unsure expression. \"Can I talk with you for a moment, alone?\" He glanced at his nephew before going down the gapping hole. Sean and Emmie were left alone in the tree house. She didn't want to intrude on Sean's searching so she looked back out the window to watch her mother and Trevor. Hannah handed Trevor the flask as he stopped before her. He ran his fingers over the metal like she had moments before. \"I think I found Max...\" she mumbled not making eye contact with the man before her. They moved through the forest tensely. Hannah put her hand out to stop them and she looked in the direction of the body. Trevor silently made his way over to the body and fell to his knees. \"So this is what really happened,\" Trevor shook his head. All that was left were his bones, deteriorated fabric, and a broken flashlight. Turning towards Hannah he sighed, \"We should burry him on the beach. He would like that.\" Sean stared at Hannah and Trevor as they entered the tensely silent tent. The woman walked over to her daughters side and grabbed her hand gently. The two had never been physically close. Hugs and kisses were never a big thing when it came to them. But all Hannah wanted to do was wrap her arms around her daughter and tell her how much she meant to her. \"So...\" Sean said raising his brows. \"We found Max,\" he whispered. \"Where?\" a look of excitement crossed the fifteen-year-olds features. Trevor swallowed loudly as a misty gloss crossed his eyes, \"He's not alive Sean.\" Uncomfortably, Emmie stood beside her mother. Trevor was piling stones atop the bones that were Max Anderson's. In the corner of gray eyes she could see Sean watching with a tight jaw. When Trevor finished he went onto Sean's other side and stared at the placement. It was then when Sean finally began to speak. His voice cracked, \"I just wish I could have known him.\" \"He wrote something for you,\" Trevor slid a folded parchment from his pocket. He faced Sean as he began to speak. \"August 14, 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday. Six weeks ago, I promised myself I would be home in time to give him his first baseball glove.\" Hannah squeezed her daughters hand. \"Now I'm worried that I'll never get the chance,\" Trevor's striking blue gaze met Sean's dark caramel eyes. \"I set out to make an incredible discovery to share with Trevor and the world...\" Sean blubbered out a sob. Emmie stared at Sean hard. It was as if this was the first time she was really seeing him. His eyes were lighter than usual as they sparkled with tears and his jaw was shaking as he tried to hold back from crying out louder. Her mother was beside her crying, Trevor had silent tears rolling down his cheeks, while Sean sobbed as quietly as possible to himself. Then Emmie stood their staring. She was discovering something... something she hadn't realized she was capable of doing. Sean was different than anyone she had ever met before and that was something she never wanted to lose. \"But now, I would trade it all...\" the man let out a sob this time. \"...just to be able to watch you grow up-\" he grabbed Sean and brought him to a fatherly hug. \"-to be the brave and caring man I am certain you will become. Happy birthday, Sean. I love you. Daddy.\" After a few moments of muffled crying they broke apart. Not bothering to spare the two females a glance they started their way back toward the tree house. Emmie stared at her mom. The golden haired woman was looking out at the ocean seemingly lost in her own thoughts. She laced her fingers through her mother's tenderly and let her eyes fall on the ocean. \"Sometimes I wonder,\" Hannah laughed to herself softly. \"How much different our lives would be if your father had really loved me enough to stay.\" She eyed her mother warily, but let the woman continue in a soft voice, \"I used to think it would be better. You would stay my sweet little angel forever. The bitterness that came over you as you got older, when you realized things weren't the way they were supposed to be, would have never emerged. Now... I don't think that would have done you any good. You have proved me wrong in so many ways in one day.\" Hannah gave her a teary eyed smile, \"I am so proud that you are my daughter.\" \"I have hardly done anything worth being proud over,\" she shrugged her shoulders awkwardly not wanting to accept the compliment. \"Yes you have,\" Hannah gazed down at her daughter. She ran a hand through the young woman's dirty brunette waves affectionately. \"You have been so brave. So powerful... I have never been proven more wrong in my entire life.\" \"Anyone else would have died by now,\" she added with a smirk. \"But not my daughter.\" She smirked, \"Well, we aren't out of here yet.\" \"Let's go back,\" Hannah tugged on her daughters hand. \"I think I'm going to sit on the beach for a bit,\" she objected letting her hand fall free from her mother's. 'I need sometime to breathe. No offense, but I've been in through enough life or death situations with you guys today that I need some space.\" Hannah nodded her head understandingly, \"Make it back before the sun sets please... or whatever that is.\" \"So.. what you are saying is that we are surrounded by lava in a giant air pocket and are going to incinerate in the next few days unless we get out of here?\" Sean questioned staring hard at Trevor. The man nodded his head as he read the pages of his brother's journal. \"The average human cannot survive beyond one hundred and thirty-five degrees. Right now it is-\" \"Ninety-five,\" Hannah inputted. \"It was eighty-five when we arrived here,\" he sighed. \"The temperatures are rising too quickly. We will have to get out of here as soon as possible if we want to live.\" \"What's the plan?\" his nephew eyed him warily. The idea of being baked like cookies in a giant oven didn't sound appealing to him. Canada was sounding better the longer he was stuck in here. \"In the book the character notes a geyser-river across the ocean that can be used to make an escape to the surface. I say we follow that,\" Trevor picked up a doodle that Max drew in his journal. He pointed where the geyser was. \"That is where we need to go.\" Hannah frowned, \"How much time do we have left?\" \"Forty hours or less.\" \"Let's rest for now and get started after we are energized,\" she said with a sigh. \"We will follow Max's plan,\" he put the journal on the table gently. Turning to Sean he smiled. \"Get some sleep.\" Sean glanced around the room, \"Where is Emmie?\" \"She's out by the shore still,\" Hannah responded looking out the window. It had only been about thirty minutes since she left her alone, but this world was so dangerous she was a bit worried. \"Why?\" \"She wanted some space.\" He sighed tiredly, \"I'll go get her. She shouldn't be out there alone anyway.\" Without further notice he exited the tree house. Hannah shot Trevor a look and the man raised a brow, \"What?\" \"He likes her...\" she smiled amusedly. Trevor laughed, \"Yeah.\" \"How about you and I take the floor and we let either Emmie or Sean take the hammock?\" The two adults started to ready themselves as they waited for their teenagers to return. I know you guys have been waiting for some flush! Sorry that it took to chapter SIX to give it to you ;-) But next chapter you will see some fluff between Emmie and Sean hehe! :3 - On that note. In this story you wont be seeing much like \"head over heels\" in love type of relationship from them. I don't want to give much away, but they are both really young and I don't think Sean would really be interested in that kind of relationship yet. DON'T WORRY. I am finishing the final chapter of this story and starting on the sequel soon! So, they will be way older and way more mature for more of a ROMANCE in that one. With some OTHER drama included. Hehe.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six He found her standing beside his father's grave. Her waist length brunette waves were caked with dirt, but still blew as the wind swept by. She had on a beige diego that was stained with dust and dirt. The gray spandex shirt she wore was muddy and had rips in the knees where she had fallen numerous times. Then her black hiking boots looked like they were trashed from all the damage they had been through in the past twenty-four hours. When she heard his footsteps draw closer she faced him and even with all the dirt, torn clothing, and matted hair Sean thought she was the most beautiful person he had ever laid eyes on. \"Hey,\" Emmie whispered delicately as he stopped a short distance away from her. She held out her hand and he looked at her unsurely. But she raised it higher and he hesitantly let his callused fingers wrap around her own mud stained hands. They were silent for a few moments just staring out at the ocean. The heat had definitely picked up in the last few hours. Sweat was dripping down Sean's neck and he suddenly felt very self-conscious. He eyed the petite girl beside him carefully. \"I don't know you well,\" she broke the silence boldly. She met her gray eyes with his. \"But your dad would be proud of you.\" His lips twitched into a small grin, \"Thanks.\" \"How old are you Sean?\" \"Fifteen...\" Sean realized that what Emmie said was true. After all they had been through they hardly knew one another. He didn't know her age. Her favorite color. What kind of music she listened to. If she had a boyfriend. \"What about you?\" Emmie smirked over at him, \"Guess.\" \"Fifteen?\" he asked hopefully. She shook her head. There was no way she was younger than him she was too mature and, well, endowed. Although, they did say girls matured faster than boys. \"Sixteen?\" \"Seventeen,\" she interjected with a wink. \"I've got two years on you buddy.\" \"Really?\" Maybe she likes younger guys... well he hoped she did. After all, he was cougar meat. That's what he told himself anyway. \"Yep!\" \"So... do you have a boyfriend?\" She barked a laugh, \"You are really bad at this kind of thing aren't you?\" \"What thing?\" a scowl made it's way over his face. \" So, Hannah, come here often ?\" she jeered referring to earlier that morning while they were climbing down the giant hole. \"And no, I don't have a boyfriend.\" A blush tinted his cheeks, \"That's... cool.\" \"Yeah, good job at beating around the bush,\" Emmie gave him a dimpled smile. \"But, it's kind of adorable. Not to mention you are cute in general so it works for you.\" \"You think I'm cute?\" Sean asked trying to keep the hopeful sound out of his voice. She rocked on the heels of her feet, \"Uh-huh.\" \"Oh,\" Sean turned beat red as he stuttered out, \"You are really cute too.\" Giggling, she stood on the tips of her toes and placed a kiss on his cheek, \"Thanks.\" If possible he turned even more red. Emmie chuckled as she turned away from him and started heading back up the beach, \"How about we head back to the tree house and catch some shut eye, stud?\" Entering the tree house, they found Trevor and Hannah munching on some of the protein bars. A portion of each was on the table for the two teens who ate them hungrily without even a thanks. \"You should take the hammock,\" Sean scratched the back of his head as he eyed the comfortable hanging fabric. He had been lying on it before he had went to find Emmie and knew how nice it felt. \"No,\" Emmie shook her head forcibly. \"It's yours.\" \"I think you should have it...\" The girl stepped closer to Sean and looked up at him carefully, \"It was your dads hammock. I think you should sleep in it. It's not my place.\" His eyes widened at her statement. That's when he noted how much he really wanted to lay there. To feel that his dad was there with him. Even if it was just something silly like a hammock... he felt a tiny bit closer to the man he wish he had met. Smiling, she turned away from him and started to situate some leaves they had gathered on the floor. It was better than sleeping on the hard wood of the tree by itself... Something was touching her. She swatted a hand out to smack it away, but it seemed to tickle her even more. Slowly, Emmie opened her gray eyes and before she knew it she was producing a very loud shriek. She rolled onto her butt and started to back away from the bug-like creature by her head. It was crawling all over the floor looking for something. Apparently her . \"Someone kill it! Kill it!\" Her shouts stirred everyone awake. Trevor was the first to react and picked up some sort of club and smashed it onto the poor bugs head. It splattered it's guts all over the floor and Emmie gagged at the gooey substance. \" Ewe ,\" Emmie dragged out with a strangled cry of disgust. \"It was crawling all over me!\" \"That would be a trilobite,\" Trevor poked the bug on the floor. \"We should probably cook the insides. It is a good source of protein.\" \"You expect me to eat that?\" she scoffed. Trevor nodded, \"If you want to live, yes.\" \"I'd rather die.\" Hannah laughed, \"You sounded like you were dying.\" \"It was going to eat me!\" she shrieked. With a moan she ran her hand over her face. \"I'm thirsty, I'm hungry, I need to use the bathroom, and I smell like crap with no toothbrush.\" \"I'm sorry princess,\" her mother chuckled with an amused expression. \"How about you and I head down to the ocean and attempt to clean ourselves up a bit while Trevor here cooks this.. bug.\" \"I'm not eating that...\" Emmie grumbled shooting Trevor a glare. \"Emmie is not a morning person,\" Hannah said in an apologetic tone. \"Once she wakes up she will be back to her normal self.\" The teen rolled her eyes, \"Whatever. Can we go? I feel disgusting.\" Sean watched as the two women exited the tree. He looked down at the dead squished bug still half asleep. He honestly had no idea what was going on at the moment he was so physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. \"You alright there kiddo?\" He looked at his uncle, \"What?\" \"When the girls get back we are going to clean ourselves up and start on that raft, alright?\" Trevor informed with a small grin. Sean didn't even look like he understood anything that was happening. \"Yeah sure...\" As Hannah and Emmie returned Sean noted that both of them had cut their spandex pants into shorts. Emmie's significantly shorter than her mothers. A plate of trilobite was on the table for both of them. Emmie glanced at Sean who had a grimace on his face as he slowly ate his own bug. She stared at the meal for a good minute debating chucking it at the back of Trevor's head for actually thinking she would eat this, or just eating it. \"Sweetie,\" Hannah said gently patting her daughters hand. \"I know it sounds terrible, but you should eat it.\" She gulped. Unhappily she stuck a small bit in her mouth and tried not to spit it out. When she finished swallowing the first bite the idea of chucking the seashell that held the bug meat became even more prominent. \"Did you eat any Trevor?\" Emmie asked angrily. He tried to smile at the irritable female, \"Yes.\" \"Huh,\" she scoffed pushing the plate away from her. \"I think I will take my chances with poisonous fruit. Or catch a fish.\" Hannah bit back her laughter. This was the American bratty daughter she was used to. It was quite amusing that she was returning to her normal habits. \"I'd like to see you catch a fish,\" Sean muttered giving her a small glare. She was being quite annoying this morning. \"Don't worry!\" standing up she gave them her chin. \"I will!\" Sean watched her leave with raised brows, \"I didn't think she would really go.\" \"She's a stubborn one,\" Hannah shook her head trying not to gag on the bug herself. \"I noticed...\" Sean muttered. Although, last nights events came across his brain and he grinned to himself. The way she had leant up on the tips of her toes and kissed his rosy cheeks... the taste of trilobite was enough to replace his happiness with a scowl. Emmie was found awhile later holding a fish in her hands. An extremely large fish. A grin was stretched across her face and she looked so proud Sean really wanted to roll his eyes, but discovered he was more amused by her cockiness. She dropped it at Trevor's feet, who was tying some long grass together with some of Hannah's rope, \"Fish!\" Trevor looked up at her, \"I see.\" \"I'm hungry,\" she placed her hands on her hips staring at him sternly. \"Well,\" Trevor averted his gaze and started at the task at hand. \"Cook it.\" She scoffed, \"I don't know how to cook a fish!\" \"You just gut it-\" \"Ewe!\" she shook her head. \"No way. That's a mans job.\" Sean sniggered at the look of pure irritation crossed his uncle's features, \"I'll do it for you...\" Emmie clapped, \"Yay!\" Uselessly, at least in Trevor's eyes, Emmie sat on the beach munching on her fish. He sure hopped it wasn't poisonous because he didn't want to deal with a sick teenager on top of all this other stuff he had to deal with at the moment. After she finished she became slightly more helpful. She helped gather long grass and tied them together. Sean smiled as she kept muttering quiet curses to herself and little \"ouches\" every time something poked her. It seemed to happen frequently too. The temperatures were rising extremely quickly. After a few hours of working on the raft the heat had reached one hundred degrees. However, they had finished the base of the raft and were now working on all the other pieces that were needed. The four were drenched in sweat from head to toe and their breaths becoming raspy from all their hard work. Trevor sat back on his feet and sighed, \"Alright. I'm going to get a drink and take a rest. We still have over twenty hours to get this done.\" Hannah wiped her brow, \"Yeah, me too.\" \"I'm just going to finish this up,\" Emmie said as she tightened the rope around a stack of the thick grass. \"I'll be to the three house in a bit.\" \"I'll help,\" offered Sean. He sat next to her and started to help tie the opposite end. Trevor shrugged at Hannah and they both started back for the tree house. There was a short awkward silence where the two teenagers focused on their work. \"So...\" Emmie gave him a dimpled grin, \"So...\" \"Where do you live in the states exactly?\" he asked after he thought about what he wanted to talk to her about. Honestly, he didn't care much about the conversation as long as she was saying something to him. \"My grandparents like to 'state bounce,' as I like to call it. But right now we are living in Kentucky. I don't like it there though.\" \"You should move to Canada,\" Sean looked at her with a grin. \"I thought you lived in New York?\" He frowned, \"Mom wants to move to Canada.\" \"Canada is nice,\" she encouraged at his sour face. \"I've been there a few times with my dad. We love it there.\" \"Really?\" She nodded her head for affect, \"And you can have all the special brownies you want!\" \"I don't want special brownies...\" he scrunched his nose and she laughed at his expression. \"Your dad travels right?\" \"Yeah, he's a German explorer. Not a scientist like your uncle.\" \"Oh.\" \"He met my mom because he wanted to hike up the mountains. They were gone for a week I believe, just exploring together. That was when I was conceived,\" Emmie cocked her head to the side looking at Sean thoughtfully. Maybe she was just like her mom. Always falling for the adventurous boys. \"She always tells me how handsome he was and how stupid she had been.\" \"Well, she had you so it wasn't a stupid decision,\" he looked at her with a grin. \"I guess,\" she sighed leaning back on the palms of her hands after they finished tying everything down. \"Your mother is as Icelandic mountain guide, your father a German explorer,\" Sean listed off. \"And your grandparents are state bouncers in America.\" \"Not to mention my Gramps was a Volcanic scientist whom thought Journey to the Center of the Earth was real...\" Emmie looked at her surroundings. \"And he was right.\" \"I can't believe we are here right now,\" Sean let himself lay down so he starting up at the large gas combustion in the bright sky. \"Just a few days ago I was complaining to my mom how I didn't want to see Trevor. I was really rude to him.\" \"Why?\" \"I haven't seen him since I was seven...\" he shrugged. \"When my dad disappeared he was kind of like my father figure. Then he stopped showing up.\" Emmie rolled onto her side so that she was somewhat hovering over him, \"Maybe he is just really bad with kids.\" \"Maybe?\" Sean laughed. \"Definitely.\" \"Do you still resent him?\" \"No...\" he locked eyes with her. \"I understand him more now. He just... missed his brother and didn't know how to be not miserable with his life.\" \"Trevor is a great guy. And cute.\" Sean scowled, \"Cute?\" \"Yeah,\" Emmie giggled at the jealous expression. \"You both look alike.\" \"You think my old uncle is cute?\" \"He's not old. He's mature, handsome, and muscular,\" she winked a gray eye. He pushed himself up into a sitting position, \"Seriously?\" \"I like older men.\" There went Sean's theory. He swore she must have liked him because he was cougar meat. \"Well, your mom is hot,\" Sean snipped. Emmie bit her lip to hold back the laughter she felt bubbling in her chest, \"I know.\" \"Well...\" he looked frustrated as he tried to find something to say to her. \"How about we go get something to drink, you look flushed.\" The younger boy rolled his eyes, \"Fine.\" Trudging back towards the tree house, Emmie had a cocky grin on her lips while Sean looked like he had just downed a gallon of sour milk. Hannah looked at Sean questionably as he entered, \"Are you alright Sean?\" \"Peachy,\" Sean shot Emmie a glare. Rolling her eyes she laughed, \"He's just jealous.\" \"Am not!\" he retorted. \"Don't listen to him, he is.\" \"What am I jealous of?\" \"Me,\" she flipped her hair. \"And other things.\" He stomped over to the hammock and flopped upon it. Hannah gave her daughter a disappointed expression why Trevor just read that little journal not even paying attention to the argument going around him.[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own anything that belongs to Journey to the Center of the Earth. Movie or book version. Chapter Seven Emmie clapped her hands giddily, \"We finished!\" \"Not quite yet,\" Trevor muttered as he started to attach rope to a large blanket. \"Well,\" she placed her hands on her hips. \"Almost.\" Hannah stood on the raft waiting for Trevor's go. He nodded his head and they both began to attach the ropes to the poles sticking out from the bottom. A large gust of wind shot up and the blanket went flying in the air. They all shouted in happiness, but the raft started tugging towards the water. \"Get on the raft!\" ordered Trevor as he hopped on. Sean and Emmie climbed aboard and not a minute latter they were set off for the geysers. The water splashed around them in a harmonious way, almost like a dance. \"Ughhh...\" Shaking her head, Hannah patted her daughters back softly, \"Don't worry. It will all be over soon.\" There was a small chirrping and Sean looked up to see one of those lightening birds, as he liked to call them. It looked familar almost as if it had been fallowing them. His thoughts were broken as Emmie gagged loudly. \"I'm going to puke...\" \"I didn't think you would get seasick,\" Trevor commented as he stared off in the distance. He swore he could see some flashes of lightening in that direction. \"I mean, after all we've been through you are getting seasick.\" Emmie responded by letting her vomit fall into the water below as she leaned over the side of the raft. A part of Sean felt bad for her, but the other part felt like it was karma from her being mean to him earlier. After they had returned to the tree house he realized she was just trying to rile him up. She thought it was funny to see him squirm. The better side of him won and he crawled over beside Emmie and Hannah. He reached for the young girls back and started rubbing circles on it soothingly. Hannah nodded appreciatively and returned to Trevor's side to make sure the boat stayed in stable condition. When she was finished vomiting she let her head rest on the floor of the raft. Sean crossed his legs and pulled her up so that her head rested on this thighs. It seemed like it would be more comfortable than the rough ground. \"Trevor...\" Hannah whispered in that worried tone of hers. Sean turned around to see her pointing in the distance. His brown eyes widened at the sight of the stormy clouds and lightening. \"I know,\" Trevor muttered. He picked up his thermostat and shook his head. \"We can't slow down to let it pass. It's already one-hundred and nine degrees.\" \"Crap...\" she looked towards her daughter lying in Sean's arms. \"Then we better prepare ourselves for a storm.\" \"... storm?\" Emmie sat up a bit and cried out when she saw the purple lightening. \"I'm going to die! In water! I hate water...\" He wanted to laugh, but held it back as she flopped back onto his thighs defeated, \"It's going to be okay.\" She shook her head 'no.' He casually brought a hand through her hair to massage her scalp. His mother used to do that to him when he was sick or upset when he was younger and it always made him feel better. Emmie was both sick and upset; so he was sure it was the perfect cure. \"Hey Sean,\" Emmie peeked a signal gray eye up at him. \"Yep?\" \"Can you promise me something?\" He raised his eyebrows as he continued to stare at her. \"When we get out of here... I want the shower first.\" He laughed, \"Fine, you can have the shower first.\" The current began to pick up and Hannah scowled at Trevor. He was such a stubborn man sometimes. They were headed in the right direction. If they wanted to get their alive they should have lowered the blanket. Trevor saw the look she was giving him and was half-tempted to roll his eyes, \"It's just a little storm.\" \"Little?\" Hannah moved her eyes toward the big flashes of light that they were nearing. \"That looks like a huge storm to me.\" \"Hey you guys,\" Sean leaned over the side of the raft. The girl had sat up and was now scooting away from the edge of the boat when she saw something swimming around the water. She hated fish and large bodies of water. If she weren't catching one to eat in desperate measures there was no way she was going near them. \"I think I see something in the water.\" \"It's probably just some plankton,\" waved off Trevor. His eyes were focused on the approaching storm. Fish were not the most important thing on his mind at the moment. Emmie narrowed her eyes as something splashed in the water a few feet away, \"I don't think it's plankton Trevor...\" \"It looks a little big.\" Sean was tugged on his butt by Emmie. She shook her head as he had been leaning his entire upper body over the dangerous waves below. \"Sean, we aren't at SeaWorld so why don't you back off a bit?\" Trevor looked toward his nephew as he tried to re-lean over the side of the raft. Emmie yanked him back once more and gave him a disapproving glare. \"I think it's a fish.\" \"Sean, seriously if you lean over the side one more time I'm going to punch you in the face!\" shouted Emmie as she hauled him by his dirty t-shirt once more. At that moment a large fish shot out of the water. Emmie screamed louder than she had when falling down that volcanic tunnel. It flopped over the side of the raft after wobbling on the middle of the rolled up grass for a second. \"Oh my God!\" Emmie scrambled onto her feet shakily. She started to spin in circles to check out her surrounds. \"That was a freaking piranha!\" Sean looked frightened as more fish popped out of the depths of the sea, \"They are everywhere!\" \"Catch!\" Trevor tossed a wooden stick towards Sean and he caught it swiftly. He was about to throw one for Emmie, but she looked so terrified that he actually handed one to her than Hannah. \"Alright, batter up guys!\" One flew out of the water and Sean smacked it hard in the middle, \"Gotchya!\" \"I'm going to die!\" the young girl cried as she jumped away from a fish that came toward her. She squealed as she swatted at it. There was a distant jingle and Hannah looked around, \"What's that noise? Do you hear that?\" \"My phone!\" Sean dug through his pocket and held up the device proudly. \"I have service!\" \"Tell them I'm dying!\" He ignored Emmie's pleas as he answered the cellular device, \"Mom! Ugh... Uncle Trevor and I are fishing...\" There was another scream from Emmie, \"Die! Die! Stop attacking me please! I wont eat anymore of you I promise!\" \"Oh! He's really excited...\" Trevor looked at Hannah to see one of the sharp toothed fish lurching for her rear end. He grabbed it by it's fin and held it up, \"Oh no you don't, pervert!\" \"He just caught a big one,\" Sean held the phone away from his face. \"Mom I really have to go I'll call you back la-\" As a fish leaped towards his face he moved as far as he could away, but it swiped his phone right out of his hand. He turned around and screamed as it disappeared into the ocean once more. \"Sean!\" He turned to Emmie who was pointing behind him. Rotating on his heel he saw a gigantic wave forming in the water. He moved out of the way in time just as a serpent type fish lifted his head to swallow one of the sharped tooth fish. She screamed and back away as far as possible from the fish as it knocked into the raft roughly. Luckily for them the fish were now too distracted eating one another to care for the humans floating on the raft. Trevor screamed as he grabbed for the rope holding up the blanket that was flapping high in the sky, \"Take us that way! Hurry!\" Sean leapt over to the tiller and started to rotate it in the direction his uncle pointed. Emmie stood back as she watched her mother and Trevor release the line as slowly as possible for them to gain even more speed. They started to clear away from the fish. It looked like everything was going great, until Hannah lost her grip on the line and it knocked her back. The rope had burned through the flesh of her skin and she cried out in pain as the blood stained her hands quickly. When he heard her scream Trevor let his own line go. This caught Emmie's attention as the rope started to slip so far out they would lose it. She darted forward and grabbed onto the right side. Thankfully, Trevor too ran towards the rope and gripped the left side. However, the wind was too stronger and before they knew what was happening they were both being swept off their feet into the sky. Crying out in fear she turned to see her mother screaming hers and Sean's names at the top of her lungs. Trevor had tried to reach out to grab them back, but all he was able to catch was air. \"Don't let go!\" Trevor screamed. He fell to his knees in defeat as they became a mere spec in the sky. \"Hold on tight Emmie,\" Sean ordered as they still kept on soaring. \"Just hold on. Don't let go.\" \"Trust me, I don't plan on it!\"[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight There was a soft moan. Sean furrowed his brows. Why had there been a moan? Who was moaning? Why couldn't he seem to comprehend anything at the moment? He felt his eyes heavy as he forced them up with more effort than it should to open ones eyes. One of the piranah's were lying beside him and he rolled away from him it petrified. Although, when he looked at it once again he realized it was dead. He sighed as he pushed himself up on his palms. Looking down he noticed that there was sand beneath him. A beach? \"Sean...\" his head snapped to his right. On the other side of the fish was Emmie tangled up in the blanket and rope on her stomach. Crawling over to her he pushed the hair that had fallen in her face out of her eyes. She blinked up at him dazedly and he noticed how bloodshot the normally gray eyes appeared. Inspecting her carefully he couldn't see any outstanding bodily harm other than a few cuts and bruises, \"Are you okay?\" \"I think so,\" Emmie groaned as she began to sit up. He placed a hand behind her back and helped her stay upright as she brought a quivering hand up to her head. Pulling her fingertips back she saw a few drops of blood. \"Ouch,\" he winced as he saw a deep cut on her forehead. \"That doesn't look so good.\" \"It hurts...\" He tugged at the bottom of his maroon shirt until it ripped. He made sure he tore enough of the fabric so that it would wrap around her head. Standing up, he held out a hand which Emmie took. They both stumbled over to the ocean having trouble steadying themselves from their collision with the sandy ground. Dipping the fabric into the water he dabbed at her forehead. She didn't even seem to notice the pain, \"Doesn't it hurt?\" \"Not really. I can't feel it,\" she looked at him glossy eyed. \"My head is throbbing though.\" \"Maybe you have a concusion or something.\" She shrugged, \"The water is pretty warm.\" Sean re-stuck his hand in the water. He hadn't noticed being so consumed with cleaning her wound that the water was indeed significantly hotter. Almost unberable at that point. \"We should hurry Sean,\" she grabbed his hand as he still sat trying to clean her cut. He nodded his head and placed the fabric around her head and tied a not in the back. \"Hello!\" Sean called out as the couple began to walk along the beach toward a cliffy area ahead. At this point he didn't know where he was. \"Trevor! Hannah!\" Emmie almost felt asleep as she walked a few steps behind Sean. He kept screaming and screaming, which only made her headache worse. She pressed her fingers into her temple and massaged it hoping it would relieve some of the pain. There was a chirp that made them both look up, \"Look! It's one of those birds.\" She nodded at Sean, \"Do you think it's the same one from the raft?\" \"Hey little guy,\" Sean cooed at the blue feathered creature. \"You want to help us find our way out?\" The creature chirped as if it had said yes. Then it flew off between the cracks of the cliff that Sean hadn't noticed was there. He quickly followed and Emmie eyed the younger boy in front of her. She thought the heat was started to affect him in negative ways. Sean frowned, \"Hey, you are going too fast!\" It disappeared around the corner and Sean threw his hands up in defeat. He turned to look back at Emmie who seemed to be sleep walking. Her hair was a tangled mess and her eyes were even more bloodshot and half open. When they rounded the corner Sean cried out happily. A stream of water was falling down the rocks. It probably wasn't clean and could contain harmful bacteria, but it wasn't salty and could replenish them. He held out his hands and splashed his dirty face. Looking beside him he tugged Emmie over and placed her gently underneath the lightly dripping water. She opened her mouth and gratefully let the warm liquid fall between her chapped lips. \"Thanks,\" Sean grinned up at the bird and it sang dantily to him. Emmie didn't think she was as quenced as she liked to be, but when she knew she would be able to carry on she moved over to let Sean get some more. She smiled as the bird continued to fly around their heads in gleeful circles. Either she was going crazy too... or that bird really was helping them out. Digging through his pocket Sean pulled out the compas Trevor had given him. His uncle had said it was his father's; he had found it in the tree house. The red arrow pointed South. \"This is the right path to the gysers,\" Sean looked beside him. Thankfully Emmie looked better after that little bit of water. Color began to return to her cheeks and the bloodshot eyes reduced a bit. She leaned over his shoulder and read the inscription, \" So you can find your way home ...\" \"Yeah,\" Sean licked his lips as their eyes met. Her eyelashes fluttered while her lips parted letting out a small breath. He could almost feel the magnetic force pulling them together. However, the bird swooped down between them giving a warning chirp. Sean had almost forgetten they were running on a time limit. He coughed as Emmie moved away from him slightly. A moments hesitation passed before they started to follow the bird once more. It felt like hours before until something, other than their muscles being strained from all their walking, happened. There was an odd shift in the air that made Sean slow his pace as they entered a large cave of sorts. He squinted in the distance to see a large opening at the other end straight across from them. Emmie began to walk slowly ahead of him glancing at the walls of the cave intrigued. Tripping over one of the rocks, Sean fell hard onto his chest. Emmy spun around and was about to ask him if he was alright when she noticed the switchblade that had once been in his picket was floating in the air around him. \"Magnetic...\" the boy muttered shocked as he stared at the floating object. \"This is a magnetic field.\" Cocking her head to the side, \"Magnetic field?\" \"Yeah,\" Sean stood and started hurrying towards her. \"We should move faster. It's getting really hot.\" Both of their paces picked up. Emmie gasped as she felt her foot slip through one of the rocks and they seperated underneath her. She hadn't even realized she screamed until she was hanging on the edge of the rock for her life. Sean's eyes widened as he reached out for her. As he was pulling her up that's when he noticed the rocks were magnetic. There was nothing underneath the rocks, they were just drifting through the air. Emmie latched herself to Sean's chest breathing heavily, \"I'm going to die. I'm going to die.\" \"I've got you,\" Sean ran a hand down her back soothingly. He placed his head atop her messy hair and she closed her eyes tightly. \"I promise I'm never going to let you go.\" After she composed herself they began to tip toe over the rocks. Things got a bit more difficult as they seperated the father they got. Emmie stiffled a few screams as Sean, ahead of her, almost slid off a few times. His body was larger than hers so it was hard for him to balance on the rocks. Then Sean jumped and knocked the rock between them too far out of jumping distance. He compressed a shout as the rock started to tip backwards. He gripped the sides praying he didn't fall off, \"No, no, no, no, no!\" \"Sean!\" Emmie tried to swing her hands out to move the rock. Surprsingly it started to work as if the air was water and she was rowing a boat with her hands. \"Hang on! I'm coming!\" Relief came over him as the rock started going back to it's original position with him on top. But a scream came from his lips as it tipped back around. Emmie sighed when the rock stopped short to the path on the other side. He scrambled off the magnetic one onto solid ground where the bird was perched waiting for them. He frowned as the bird looked at him somewhat questionably, \"Oh yeah! You try doing that without wings.\" When Emmie was in reaching distance Sean held out a hand and she hopped off the rock. He caught her around the waist and she grinned up at him. The bird chirped and they started their journey through the cave. Sorry for the late update... I've been going through a terrible breakup and I have been so emotionally drained for the past month that I didn't even have the energy to post anything. I'm back. I'm here. And I'm stronger than I've ever been (or at least trying to be). Thank you so much for the reviews! I'm glad I've changed some of your minds on my story :-)[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine \"You kind of look like a pirate with that wrapped around your head.\" Emmie rolled her eyes at the boy walking alongside her through the deserted area, \"Arg.\" \"You are pretty awesome though...\" Sean pursed his lips embarrased as Emmie stared up at him. \"You've got that whole bad girl thing going on.\" \"Oh really?\" she laughed. Reaching out her hand she let it brush against his own. He gazed at her wonderingly as she laced her fingers through his own with a dimpled smile on her pink lips. She looked up at him scrunching her nose in the process, \"You are pretty awesome too.\" The sweet moment was ruined when Emmie had to realse his hand as her foot got caught under something hard. She fell forward, hard, down a small hill. Sean gasped and carefully ran down the slump and helped her onto her feet. \"What was that?\" glancing back her eyes bugged out. There were bones. Large bones. Bones fifty times the size of her entire body. Dinosaur bones. \"Man, I really wish I read that book...\" There was a thunderous sound in the distance. Emmie latched her fingers around Sean's bicep with paniced eyes. She had read the book. \"We need to hide,\" she rushed. They both lunged over to a tall mass of rock and pressed their bodies tight against it. His hand found hers once more finding that he felt reassured everytime the action was commensed. The ground began to shake softly and gradually became harder as something drew near. Emmie clenched her eyes shut tightly wishing she was anywhere but there at the moment. And then a sound of something wet hit the floor. Both Sean and her gazed down at their feet to see a goopey liquid splat on the sandy floors. Staring upward Sean's jaw tightened at the frightening creature growling above them hungrily. Another drop of saliva escaped the tyranasuraus mouth landing direction on Sean's face. Emmie would have gagged at the disgusting sight if she hadn't been forced to run for her life as the dinosaur opened it's mouth. Sean tugged on her hand and started to run in the opposite direction. Their feet hit the floor hard as they ran as quickly as they could. Being already exhausted and extremely dehydrated wasn't helping their case at all. When Emmie felt like she were about to give up from exhaustion and allow the creature to devour her greedily Sean shoved her into a hole in a crevice. However, it ended up not being the greatest idea as they were trapped between the beast knocking down the matted sand and a wall behind them. Sean and Emmie both screamed as the tyranasaurous made headway and actually got deeper into their hiding space. Sean turned his head as something pounded on the wall from the other side. A crack started to form and he thought maybe another evil creature would pop out from the other side. But when he saw a familar fist break the barrior he almost cried. When the hole was big enough he roughly shoved Emmie through the space and followed her quickly just as the monster made it more than half-way through. Trevor brought his nephew into a bone crushing hug. The idea of losing his brother's son was worse than actually losing his brother, if that were possible. \"I am so glad to see you,\" admitted Trevor. Sean nodded his head, \"Me too.\" \"We should go,\" Emmie interrupted as she heard the tyrannasaurs bang against the already broken into wall. \"Fast.\" Not even a moment after they started sprinting the large creature was on their tale. Emmie screamed as it snapped at her back touching a strand of her hair. Trevor started branching away from them and the dinosaur seemed to beging to tag after him. \"What are you doing?\" Sean shouted as he saw that the dinosaur was no longer after Emmie or him, but his uncle. \"The geyser is that way!\" he pointed in the opposite direction. \"Over there is muscovite. The same type of rock we fell through in the volcanic tunnel.\" He frowned, \"It wont hold you!\" \"It wont hold him either!\" \"Trevor, no!\" Emmie started in the older man's direction. Sean did not seem to disagree as he too started moving towards his uncle. Trevor looked back to see the tyrannasaous snap his sharp teeth at him. He managed to speed up just in time for it to miss him by an inch. There was the sound of light cracking, but the rock seemed to be holding out. \"It's not breaking Trevor!\" Sean informed as he saw the dinosaur draw closer to his uncle. Just as the dinosaur opened his jaw and Trevor was in reach there was a horrendously loud boom. The floor gave in under the dinosaurs feet and soon the entire ground around them was shattering. Sean cried out loudly as he saw his uncle disappear. They both picked up their pace and hanging on the edge was none other than Trevor with a sour expression. \"I hate field work!\" he grumbled while Sean pulled him up. Emmie jumped on the man, which surprised Trevor, sean and herself, and eloped him and a great hug, \"Don't ever do that again.\" \"I don't plan on it,\" Trevor patted her back awkwardly. When she backed up she grabbed onto Sean's hand and smiled up at him. \"The geyser is straight that way. If we hurry we should be able to make it.\" \"... well this is just great,\" Emmie crossed her arms over her chest. Sean sighed exhaustedly, \"The water is too hot.\" \"What we really need is a boat,\" Trevor said. \"Yeah, how do you suppose we get one of those?\" Trevor shot Emmie a glare for her attitude, but before he could make a comment the sound of splashing in water could be heard. As if the heavens heard their silent prayers Hannah came around a corner paddling an upsidedown tyrasauarous rex head. Hannah smirked at the three's shocked expressions, \"Who had dibs again?\" Trevor and Sean pointed at their chests. \" Mom !\" Hannah brought her daughter into a bone clenching hug when she climbed inside the dinosaur head. The older man shot Hannah a shy smile. He hadn't understood why she had kissed him before he left to go find Sean and Emmie, but he knew as soon as they were out of there alive that would be the first thing he repayed. After Hannah had been paddling for a few moments she noticed the water begin to sink. She searched around her to see that it was begining to evaporate from the steam, \"We are losing water quickly.\" A scream erupted is the water disappeared making the skull fall down. Thankfully, it was caught between the wall and couldn't budge much more than few meters. Sean peered over the edge, \"What's that light down there?\" \"That's lava-\" \"Lava!\" Emmie shrieked leaning over the edge. She coughed as some of the fumes made their way up the tube. \"I'm so going to die right now.\" \"What do we do?\" Hannah directed this towards Trevor. \"There's nothing we really can do... we ran out of water and that's the only way.\" \"What about the geyser. What happened to it?\" Trevor shook his head at Sean's question, \"No. We are too late for the geyser. WE missed it.\" \"How?\" Emmie scanned the walls. \"It looks like the walls are still wet.\" Hannah touched the stone, \"It is wet.\" \"And cold,\" Sean added. \"That's impossible,\" Trevor frowned. \"It's over one hundred and thirty degrees in here.\" \"Behind you!\" Trevor turned and felt the wall behind him. He pressed his hands against the surface and fold the cold slippery texture, \"There has to be some air pocket holding the water behind the walls.\" \"Trevor...\" Sean looked over the edge. \"The lava is getting closer.\" The older man brought his fingers to his nostrils and sniffed, \"Hey, that's magnesium.\" A jolt pushed the skull down a few inches. Hannah gripped her fist against the walls to steady herself, \"We are slipping!\" \"Oh God,\" Emmie reached out for Sean's hand. \"We are going to die.\" \"Now who's the baby?\" he muttered under his breath, but Emmie didn't seem to hear him or care. She just stared wide eyed at Trevor who looked to be deep in thought. He turned to Hannah and stretched his arm out, \"How many flares do we have left?\" \"Three,\" she slung her backpack off her shoulder. Handing him the flares she eyed him as he started pushing himself out of the skull and letting his entire torso swing over the edge. \"What are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to light the magnesium,\" he looked her in the eye and winked. \"On purpose this time.\" They all watched as he lit the flare and held it against the wall. He cursed as it slipped from his fingers and fell down into the lava with a boom, \"It's too wet!\" \"That's what she said...\" Hannah slapped her daughter in the arm. She looked at Trevor as he reached out for another one. \"I have to go further down. Hold my legs!\" Sean gripped his uncle's legs as Trevor completely left the skull. He swung his arm out, but the flare refused to ignite the magnesium. The light went out and he grunted as sweat dripped down his temples. Sean tugged him back into the skull. Hannah held out the last one and Trevor looked at her sternly, \"You are going to have to tie my legs. It's the only way I can get down far enough.\" Emmie peeked down and shivered, \"It's so close now! I don't want to be burned to a crisp.\" Trevor was lowered over the edge and lit the flare. Pressing it against the wall he shook his head. He didn't understand why it wasn't working. But then he looked across at the other side of the wall and noticed that there appeared to be magnesium there as well. \"I'm going to have to throw it to the other side!\" he screamed. He didn't wait for a reply as he counted softly to himself and tossed it on three. Every one was silent as a spark erupted. However, a wave of sadness came over them as it disappeared a second later. \"Ahhh!\" Emmie shook a pointed finger at the wall. \"Look!\" \"It's lit, it's lit!\" screamed Sean. \"Trevor,\" Hannah excitedly followed suit. \"It's lit!\" \"Pull me up!\" he looked down at the lava oozing up towards him. \"Pull me up!\" \"Pull, pull, pull!\" Hannah chanted. Emmie, Sean and herself all grabbed the rope and tugged with all their strength until Trevor fell over the edge into the skull. He shoved them all to the ground quickly, \"Get down, it's going to blow!\" As if on que, the wall bursted open and water poured out. When it met the lava it exploded into a gust of steamy air. The four screamed as it pushed them upward. \"Is that sky?\" All their eyes blinked up at the blue up ahead through the opening. There screams continued as they cascaded up and burst out of the hole. \"Hang on!\" Trevor shouted. \"Trust me, I'm hanging on,\" Hannah sarcastically bit back. The skull touched the ground of the mountain and they were zipping through fields of fruit and vegetables at an alarming speed. But the more dense the plants became the slower the skull was on it's way down. They were soon jolted to a stop by a loud boom as they crashed into a wall. Emmie grunted as she looked to her right to see that the rest of them were shaken up, but alive. \"Le mie piante! Il mio tutore bella! Stolti!\" There was an Italian farmer swinging his hands around wildly motioning up the mountains. His frantic shouts were ignored as the four tried to come out of there shock. When they were all standing up, Trevor turned towards the mountain,\" Hey Sean. If your mom asks I took you to Italy?\" \"Italy?\" Emmie looked behind her with wide eyes, \"How the heck did we end up in Italy?\" \"La mia vita è rovinata ... come faccio a sostenere me e la mia famiglia?\" the Italian farmer looked ready to cry as he watched them all with wide terriified eyes. Sean dug into his backpack and pulled out one of the diamonds he had achieved on his journey. Going over to the man he held it out. In the worst Italian accent ever he gestured for the man to take it, \"You take this! We are sorry.\" \"Wow Sean...\" Emmie mummbled mockingly at his accent. She climbed over the edge and stood beside him as the man took hold of the diamond transfixed by it's beauty. \"Sean!\" Trevor held up the bag of jewels looking at his nephew skeptically, \"Sean.\" \"What?\" he shrugged his shoulders. \"I just took a few geological samples.\" \"A few?\" \"A few pounds of samples, but what do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.\" The Italian man hugged the diamond, \"You slide again?\" Emmie frowned, \"No thank you.\" \"Take whatever you want!\" he urged with a wide grin. Sean laughed as Emmie gave him an annoyed look. Glancing over her shoulders her eyes widened. Sean followed her gaze and it landed upon his uncle and Hannah who were locked in a passionate kiss. \"Well,\" she said with a smirk. \"I guess Trevor has dibs. Not you.\" \"I have dibs on the mountain guide,\" Sean objected slyly. Emmie raised her eyebrows, \"Oh really? Looks like she's kissing your uncle.\" \"No.\" He bit his lip as he stepped towards Emmie. Her gray eyes stared up at him as he pressed a hand against her neck and drew her head towards him. Their lips met briefly and Sean moved back with a cherry blush on his cheeks, \"It looks like she's kissing me.\" Emmie grinned, \"I'm not a mountain guide, stupid.\" \"Don't be so literal,\" Sean rolled his eyes. She looked at her mom who was dazedly smiling at Trevor, \"So... it looks like we are going to be cousins?\" Sean snorted, \"Gross.\" \"You think it's gross kissing your cousin?\" \"No. Well I mean yes,\" he furrowed his brows. \"I don't mind kissing you because you are not like my blood cousin. If you were by birth then yes I would think it's gross. I just think it's gross that Hannah is kissing Trevor because why would anyone want to kiss-\" He was caught off by Emmie stepping on her toes and kissing him softly on the mouth. He closed his eyes and fell into her kiss. \"Hey!\" Trevor called out. \"That's enough you two! We need to get home.\" \"Home?\" asked Sean dejectedly. Emmie took hold of his hand amusedly, \"Of course silly. Thought we were going to live on the mountains forever?\" Sean sighed, \"I don't want to go to Canada.\" ONE MORE CHAPTER LEFT! o_O[Chapter 10] THIS IS THE LAST CHAPTER /3 Last Chapter The front door opened letting the warm Boston air breaze though. A smile twitched onto the seventeen-year-olds pink lips as she sat on the small comofrotable couch. She stretched out her arms being tense from sitting in the same position for so long. She sprinted around the corner with a grin and was met with an even brighter smile. Wrapping her arms around the younger boy she pulled him into a hug. It had been too long since they had seen one another last. \"Sean!\" Hannah appeared beside Trevor with gleeful smiles. Her mother broke them apart and hugged Sean bear-like, \"Oh Sean! It's so nice to see you. It's been months.\" \"Yeah-\" Trevor messed up Sean's already messy brown hair with his hand. \"I didn't know you were coming.\" \"I told Emmie,\" he shot his girlfriend a look and she shrugged her shoulders. \"I thought telling you was too much effort,\" she explained when her mother shot her a look. This resulted in a scoff from the older woman. \"Plus, Sean and I have buisness to attend to!\" \"Oh do you now?\" Hannah eyed the too warily. \"Uh-huh!\" Trevor saw the wheels turning in Hannah's head, \"What kind of buisness?\" Emmie bit her lip as she held out her copy of Atlantis, \"Don't worry Mom. What did you think I was talking about?\" Hannah and Trevor shared a laugh causing Sean to blush awkwardly. He moved past them and carried his bags up to the spare room where he normally slept when he stayed over. Hannah had made Trevor clean it out after she saw how disasterous his house was. The sound of the door shutting made him spin around to see Emmie leaning agaisnt it with a dazzling grin. She skipped over to him and pushed him so that he was sitting on the bed. He smiled as she plopped down beside him and wrapped her arms around his torso bringing them into a blissful hug. \"I missed you.\" He kissed the top of her head, \"Me too.\" \"I can't believe I missed your birthday,\" she pouted up at him. \"And to think, you are almost the same age as me now!\" \"In a few months I'm going to be jailbait though,\" he wiggled his brows. Emmie snorted, \"You aren't jailbait. We are like a year and a half apart.\" \"I can't wait to tell everyone I have an eighteen-year-old girlfriend.\" She rolled her gray eyes at his immaturity, \"I bet you can't.\" Spontaneously, he stole a kiss from her lips. She smiled against his own happy to finally be able to be with him. They had been seperated for nearly three months. It was terrible. All the long distance phones calls... emails... Facebook chats... even Skype. Nothing compared to being able to press her lips against his. When they broke apart she walked over to her closet slowly. She glanced back at Sean with a devious smirk, \"I got you a little something for your birthday!\" \"Oh?\" he bit his lip as she bent over to dig through something in the depths of her closet. The action couldn't help be acknowledged by caramel eyes appreciatively. She held whatever it was behind her back as she made her way back over to him, \"The only way to get your present is if you pass a test.\" \"What kind of test?\" Placing a finger under her chin she looked thoughtfully down at Sean, \"Well... you have to show me how much you care about me.\" \"Show you?\" Sean frowned as she nodded her head happily at him. How was he supposed to show her that he cared? He kissed her, flew all the way out here just to see her, and gave her hugs... He grabbed her hand and pulled her into a kiss. It first started out normal as usual. Just a little peck on the lips that ended up getting a bit of tongue action. But when she went to pull back he cupped her cheeks between his large hands and pressed his mouth harder against hers. Emmie breathed heavily as she broke back to get air. She looked down at Sean as he smiled up at her softly. \"I think I know how to prove it...\" She raised her eyebrows, \"Oh?\" Sean kissed her gently, \"I love you.\" A blush fought her cheeks as she gaped at Sean. Had he said that to her before he gave her such a passionate kiss she would have laughed at him. She shoved the present into his hands not sure what else to do. He broke eye contact as he looked down at the leather bound journal that rested in his lap. He twisted it in his palms seemingly transfixed by the object. After a moments silence Emmie exhaled loudly. Her palms were sweating and her stomach was tied in nots, \"I love you too, Sean.\" His eyes had tears in them as he blinked up at her, \"Thank you.\" \"I bought if for you so you could, you know, write stuff down like your dad,\" Emmie scooted closer to him on the bed. She rested her head against his shoulder causing her long waes to cascade against his arm. \"So that one day when you have a kid they can read all of your adventures.\" Their lips melted into one anothers once more. Sean didn't know if they would end up together in the end, but there was one thing he did know. He loved Emmie and that was enough for him. And he couldn't wait to go on more adventures with her. The end. ","Summary":" *This story is just for fun! :3 DISCLAIMER: I love Journey to the Center of the Earth, but I do not"},{"Movie":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","Title":"The Only Girl Worth Fighting For","Author":"Just Another Angry Feminist","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7448594","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'm rewriting this story because it was shit before. \"Please Hannah I really want to go; it would be such an amazing experience. I mean who all can say that they spent a year in the rainforest helping injured animals?\" I asked for the thousandth time. \"Plus it looks amazing on college applications. I could get scholarships because of it!\" \"Scarlett, you know how much I hate to tell you no but who knows what's inside those forests. You could get some kind of disease from a bug and die or you could touch a plant and have to get your hand removed,\" Hannah shouted, throwing her hands up. \"I didn't take custody of you after your parents died just so you could go off and get killed.\" I rolled my eyes but before I could respond I heard a knock on the door. She looked at me and said, \"Don't you go anywhere until I get back here.\" I shouted back at her, \"You won't let me go to a rainforest to help animals, you won't let me chain myself to a tree in protest, and you won't even let me fast; what can I do?\" She ignored me so I went to the front of the house to yell at her some more but I stopped in my tracks. There was a tall, muscular guy talking to Hannah but I didn't hear a word that they were saying all my attention was on the gorgeous guy standing behind them. He was about 5'10 and had brown hair that was partially hidden underneath a brown beanie. He and the tall dude had a similar build so I assumed that they were related but I could be wrong. I moved closer to Hannah and waited for an introduction. \"This is my goddaughter Scarlett; Scarlett this is Trevor and Sean. They're here to see my late father,\" she explained taking my hand in hers. \"I told them that he is no longer here.\" I knew it was a sore subject for Hannah so I gestured over to the table in the middle of the kitchen. There were only two chairs so I let Hannah and Trevor sit down while I sat at the island. When Sean walked over to me and stood I couldn't hold in my laughter. I pulled out the other stool and said, \"You can sit here if you want; unless you just want to stand there.\" He sat on the stool but I noticed he scooted it a little bit closer to me. His cheeks colored when he saw me looking at him; \"Thanks.\" We focused back in on Hannah and Trevor's conversation. \"I'll take you up there but it's going to cost 5,000 dollars.\" \"5,000 dollars a day; I think we can handle that,\" Trevor said cockily, shaking his hair out a little bit. I giggled and said, \"She means 5,000 dollars an hour.\" I laughed when his face fell and Sean let out an exasperated noise adjusting his beanie. \"Do you take rolled quarters? If so I think we've got it covered,\" Sean said, shooting Trevor a smile. Hannah gave me a look and I explained, \"Quarters are American money; they're a quarter of a dollar, see it makes since. I'll transfer them for you later.\" Hannah looks at me and I explained, \"Quarters are American money. They're a quarter of a dollar, see it She nodded at me then looked outside. \"It's too dark outside for you guys to go anywhere tonight. You're going to stay here tonight and we'll leave first thing in the morning. Sean you can sleep in Scar's room and Trevor you can take mine. I'll sleep on the couch tonight.\" \"I don't want to intrude, I'll take the couch,\" Trevor said, trying to be gallant. I knew this wasn't going to end well so I took Sean's hand in mine and dragged him to my room. He grabbed his bag on the way and I shut the door on the slowly forming fight between Trevor and Hannah. I have a relatively small room with teal colored walls and a twin white canopy bed. I stood there and tried to remember where I put all of my blankets so I could make a pallet on the floor. I suddenly remembered that they were in the closet so I walked over to grab them and started making the pallet in the middle of the floor. I felt Sean grab my wrist and I turned around quickly. He flipped it over and looked at my tattoo. \"What is this, other than a tattoo, I mean? Does it mean anything?\" It was a series of vines that were intertwined with each other and made a circle. After I recovered from the electric shock his touch sent up my arm I said, \"It represents how everything in the world is connected; intertwined with one another. How everything we do has reactions of mass proportions.\" He smirked at me and said, \"That's really cool; my mom would flip shit if I ever got a tattoo. She's a little bit on the uptight side. I'll sleep on the floor by the way.\" I was shocked by his politeness but I quickly declined it. \"That's fine; you're the guest so you get the best. I don't mind to take the floor.\" He looked over at my bed and said, \"I think we can both fit if we squeeze, unless you'd rather sleep on a hardwood floor than a comfortable bed.\" I felt my cheeks heat up and I said, \"I wouldn't want to make you feel awkward. I mean we hardly know each other and we're going to share a twin size bed.\" \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it; where can I change into my pajamas,\" he said with that smirk of his. \"You can stay in here, I'll just go into the bathroom and change,\" I said as I grabbed some flannel bottoms and a long sleeve shirt of off my dresser. I ran into the bathroom and had a mini panic attack. I was going to be sharing my itty bitty bed with Mr. Hottiepants. Oh sweet baby Jesus. After I was dressed I walked into my room without knocking on the door and Sean was in the middle of pulling his shirt on. Jesus that boy was ripped; he had some great abs and godly arms. In the middle of checking him out I realized that he still didn't have his shirt pulled down. I looked up to his face and I saw him watching me. \"If you're finished checking me out I think it's time for bed,\" he said, climbing into bed and patting a spot for me. After I calmed down my flaming cheeks I turned off my lights and slid into my bed. I heard him snickering being me and I said, \"Shut up.\" Yep, I hope it wasn't as bad as it was before.[Chapter 2] They be 16 instead of like 12. So yeah; Sean's Point of View: I woke up in the middle of the night with Scarlett sprawled all across me completely dead to the world. I smiled and shifted her over so I could scratch my leg then I let her move back into her original position and fall back asleep. I barely knew this girl but she'd already found a part of me that I forgot existed. With her strawberry curls and her big emerald eyes she was easily the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I knew she would deny up and down that she lay sprawled on me so I'd better remember this. As I fell back asleep I heard her mumbling under her breath. She must have been having a good dream based on the little sounds she kept making. Scarlett's Point of View: I woke up the next morning and found that I was burrowed into Sean's side. I knew I needed to move but I was so damn comfortable that I didn't. I faked being asleep until felt him starting to wake up. I figured that he would move my arm from around his waist but he didn't, he just pulled me closer to him. \"Scarlett; Sean, it's time to wake up! We have a really long day today,\" Hannah shouted from outside my door. I ended up bashing my head against Sean's as we rushed to get up. I let out an annoyed sound before saying, \"Fuck that hurt; your head is hard as hell.\" Then I rubbed the spot just above my ear where the smacked together. He was doing the same thing as I was when he said, \"I could tell you the exact same thing, sweetheart. It's a good thing that you're hot or you would be really unpleasant to be around.\" His change in attitude shocked me; he was so sweet to me last night and now he's being a total prick to me. He's just like every other guy on the planet and I was tired of them. I didn't say anything back to him; I just grabbed my stuff and went into the bathroom to get ready. I heard the shower running and said a hello to Hannah. She greeted me back and I started to get dressed. She had set out a pair of black cargo pants with a red tank top before pulling my hair up into a sloppy bun. I tied a bandana around my head to hold my bangs back before putting on a little amount of makeup and left Hannah to her shower. I knocked before entering my room this time to keep from reenacting our awkward night last night. He was using my mirror to spike up his hair and he nodded to me with a smirk on his lips. I rolled my eyes while I put my hiking pack onto my bed and began to load it up. I put a pair of cheer shorts, my ipod, my phone and my Hunger Games book inside. I grabbed a first aid kit and some sunscreen; you could never be too careful when it came to mountain climbing. When I bent over to tie my shoes I felt Sean's eyes on me. When I looked in the mirror I saw his eyes wondering up and down my body. My tank top didn't go all the way to my waist, it stopped just shy of my hipbones. I rolled my eyes again and threw my pack over my shoulders with my jacket in the straps hanging by my waist before walking out the door. Soon enough we were all on our way up the mountain side. I stayed behind, on Hannah's instruction, to make sure the guys didn't die. They seemed to be having insane difficulties keeping up with us. \"Can you boys please hurry up? I want to make it home before sun down,\" Hannah shouted over her shoulder as she climbed faster. \"Dibs,\" I heard Sean say brow down below me. I started to climb slower so I could listen to their conversation. \"Dibs on what?\" Trevor asked, he sounded breathless and I smiled slightly. \"The mountain guide, I call dibs on her,\" Sean said, matter-of-factly. \"She's a hottie.\" \"You're sixteen; you can't call dibs on her. She's like twice your age anyway,\" Trevor said, trying to catch his breath. \"Whatever, you're just mad that I called dibs before you could. Don't lie,\" Sean challenged, making me look down at them and let out an annoyed huff. \"How about you stop living in Narnia or wherever it is your fantasies take place and start to climb the damn mountain faster?\" I asked, glaring down at them –Sean mostly. \"Why don't you get the stick out of your ass and make me? I don't see you any further up than us anyway,\" Sean fired back. I let out an exasperated noise and made sure to kick rocks down on them as I made my way up the mountain at top speed. I heard him shout out curse words that had Trevor reprimanding him. I frowned when I caught up with Hannah I spat out, \"Why do you have to be so damn beautiful and get all of the guy's attention?\" I shouldered past her and felt hot, angry tears building up behind my eyelids. I clenched them tight and refused to cry over that pompous ass. Once I reached the top I hid behind a rock and let the tears fall down my cheeks. When I heard them nearing me I pulled out my mirror from my pack and fixed up my face. After it wasn't obvious that I'd been crying I walked over to join them. I heard Trevor and Sean's breathing and it was harsh and labored; I couldn't help but feel a little bit smug. Hannah gave them a confused glance but didn't ask questions. I waved her odd and asked Trevor, \"Are those monitors what you're looking for?\" I then pointed over to the cylindrical object sticking out of the ground. \"That is what that is, good eyes Scarlett,\" Trevor said, winking at me before he walked over towards the monitor. I felt Hannah tugging on my jacket sleeve and saw her point up at the sky. The clouds were black and they were rolling in quickly; we needed to take shelter and we needed to take it now. I looked around and saw a cave; I pointed it out to Hannah. \"Professor, we're going to have to take shelter, there's a storm coming in,\" Hannah shouted over at Trevor, trying to make herself heard over the incoming wind. \"Scarlett, I need you to take Sean to the cave and take cover. I'll get Trevor over there with me in a sec,\" Hannah said. I walked into the cave and sat on a rock while I waited for them to come inside with me. Sean came over to me and sat down by my feet but I just ignored him. I looked outside when lightening flashed close to the cave; Hannah and Trevor were running back with the flashing following them. Suddenly everything clicked in my head; the monitor was attracting the lightening. I heard Hannah say the same thing, making Trevor throw the monitor down and run towards the cave. Once they jumped inside there was a loud crash and Sean rolled me off the rock and under him. Even though he was shielding me from the rubble I still felt a blush break out across my entire body where his hard body was touching mine. \"Is everything okay?\" Hannah shouted. \"Scarlett, where are you?\" \"We're good,\" Sean shouted. Then he looked down at me and asked quietly, \"Are you okay, Scar?\" I pushed him off and said, \"Why do you care? It's not like you called dibs on me or anything.\"[Chapter 3] Yep, there may be some errors and I apologize for that. Sean's Point of View: I must have hit a nerve when I called dibs on Hannah. Damn, that wasn't supposed to happen, I was just trying to make her jealous and get her to notice me. Well I guess she was noticing me but not in the way that I wanted her to and I had no clue how to fix it. \"Those rocks are way too big to move so we're going to have to find a different way out. There are two tunnels, which one do we take?\" Scarlett asked, putting her hair back into its place. \"You're hair's fine; you still look completely beautiful,\" I whispered into her eat as I came up behind her. She jumped and pushed me back. \"Whatever,\" she said, walking back over to Hannah. Damn, she was way madder at me than I thought. I couldn't be too upset, she was way too sexy. \"I have a good feeling about this tunnel right here. I think we should go this way,\" Trevor said, leaving us behind. We groaned and followed closely behind him. I fell in between Scarlett and Hannah as we made our way deeper into the tunnel. All of a sudden Hannah pushed past me and grabbed the back of Trevor's jacket. She ended up knocking Scarlett onto her ass where she was still located. \"Do you need some help up?\" I asked, taking her smaller hands into mine and pulling her to her feet. I pulled her up so fast that she ended up face to chest with me in less than a second. I felt her nose bump me and I got a smell of her hair. Apples and strawberries assaulted my senses and it was amazing. \"Hannah, do you have a flare on you?\" Trevor asked, drawing all of our attention. \"Sean, I need you to time this on your watch, okay? Starting right now.\" The he dropped it down the hole. Suddenly there was an explosion and I jumped back slightly making Scarlett giggle. Before I could respond Hannah asked, \"Isn't that magnesium, professor?\" He rubbed his hand against it and brought it up to his nose. \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that it is. Too bad we didn't notice that in the beginning.\" \"I have a glowstick in my pack, I think that it would work better in this situation,\" Scarlett said handing him one that was already snapped. \"Full speed ahead, doll.\" \"Sean, I need you to start the countdown,\" Trevor said dropping the glowstick into the black hole. \"One… two… *thud*…. Almost three,\" I counted aloud for him. Trevor seemed to be doing math in his head before he announced, \"That's about 200 feet down. Hannah, do you have enough rope to get us down there?\" \"I always have enough rope, professor,\" Hannah said. Then Scarlett questioned, \"Are we repelling down or something?\" Hannah nodded and looked over at Scarlett; \"I'm going to hook you and Sean together. I want you guys to repel down together, okay?\" What she said started to sink in when I saw Scarlett take off her jacket and tie it around her waist along with a rope around both of ours. I leaned into her and whispered, \"We're going to do a free climb into the black pit of nothing?\" \"Yeah,\" she said, taking my hand in hers. \"If you get scared, I want you to talk to me and we'll get your mind off of it. You have to trust me though, can you do that?\" I nodded, trying to ignore the sweat beading along my hairline as we took our first steps down. I must have been close to breaking her hand as we made it to about two feet down. \"Talk to me, Sean. Ask me a question or something,\" Scarlett said, locking eyes with me. \"So… Sc-Sc-Scarlett do you come here often?\" I stuttered out and head Trevor laughing below us. \"You're not helping Trevor. This is scary for all of us,\" Scarlett chided. Then she turned back to me and smiled, \"No, I don't come here very often. I know that you're nervous and it's really cute.\" I could feel my cheeks heating up as I shook my head to clear it. Then I felt the rope start to pull down and my life flashed before my eyes. Scarlett look down before squeezing my hand and saying, \"I need to let go and get up to Hannah, okay?\" I nodded and watched as she took the knife out of Hannah's hand. Then Hannah shouted down to Trevor, \"The line is caught on something; Scarlett is going to cut it and let you go down.\" Before I could say anything Scarlett had cut the line and I heard Trevor let out a scream. I squeezed my eyes closed and took Scarlett's hand in mine, squeezing it. When I heard her start laughing I opened my eyes and we were about three inches above the ground. Trevor was sprawled out and his breathing was really harsh. The moment I was free I ran over and sat down beside him. I watched Scarlett sit down next to me and take my hand in hers. \"I know this isn't manly or whatever so I'm going to whisper it. If you're ever scared or freaked out just take my hand and we'll face it together.\" I couldn't express how much I appreciated that. I needed someone down here with me, even if I was falling for her. I realized how stupid this was, seeing as we might die down here. \"Hey Hannah, you knew that I was that close to the ground, right?\" Trevor asked as we started walking again. When she didn't answer he repeated, \"Right?\" I laughed with Scarlett and squeezed her hand. I wasn't frightened or anything, I just wanted to have her close to me. Suddenly she squeezed it back and I knew that it was okay. \"You were really sexy repelling down the mountain like that,\" I whispered to her. \"It may not be as good as adorable but it's pretty damn close.\" Before I could wimp out, I kissed her temple through her hair.[Chapter 4] Yep, this chapter is dedicated to xForevermore for reviewing everyone of my chapters. I hope you like it :) Scarlett's Point of View: He had just called me sexy, oh my god. How do I respond to that? No one had ever called me that before, they've called me pretty and such, but never sexy. I felt my cheeks heating up when his lips barely brushed my temple. \"Hey you guys look at this, it looks like an old mine shaft,\" Trevor said. \"I wonder how we turn the lights on down here.\" Out of nowhere Hannah flipped a really big switch and all of the lights in the shaft came on. I heard Trevor say something about safety and I saw Hannah brush him off. I loved her for being such a badass even if she didn't let me do the crazy stuff that I wanted to. I heard Sean shout, \"Oh my God, I call shotgun.\" I looked over and saw the mine cars sitting on a track they looked rusty and out of date. Thinking back on the cave in and how not that many people escaped I didn't think that they were too trusted. \"You guys we may have just found a way out,\" Trevor said walking up to them and standing beside the cart behind Sean's. \"What do you think, Hannah?\" \"I don't know if they're safe but I guess we could try them out. It's not like we have any other choice. I'll go with you, Trevor, Scar you go with Sean okay?\" Hannah said getting into the cart behind the anxious looking Sean. I swallowed and got into the cart behind Sean. He turned around and scooted me to the front and before I had a chance to ask why he wrapped his arms around my waist and I felt the cars spring to life under my feet. I turned around and hid my face in Sean's chest. I wrapped my arms around his middle and refused to turn around. I felt his hands rubbing up and down my back and felt a little bit comforted. \"Hey Trevor, I think I see something up ahead,\" Sean shouted back to him. \"And I don't think it looks to good.\" I wanted to look but I was too afraid to move from my position. But finally I took a deep breath and turned around. In front of us about five feet away and coming at us fast was a big hole in the track and we were speeding right towards it. \"Why don't these things have seatbelts?\" I heard him shout back to Trevor again but I was hidden in Sean's chest again, refusing to look at my awaiting death. I felt us leaving the track and held on tighter to Sean's waist as he shouted out with joy, he was enjoying this? What a freak. Then I felt a jolt I felt us being on a track again. \"Hey you guys pull the break we need to meet up again,\" I heard Hannah shout and when I looked up I saw why. We were on completely different tracks and speeding in different directions. I looked around franticly for a brake but couldn't find one. Then I felt Sean take my hands in his behind his back and I knew he was freaked out too. Then I felt us coming to a stop but I couldn't break my grip on his waist. He just stood there and whispered into my ear about how we were safe and it was going to be okay. Soon enough I broke off my monster grip and just held his hand in mine. \"Hey, look who's coming around. I'm not going to let you get hurt, I promise,\" he whispered when I hugged him close to me again. \"Thank you; I usually don't freak out like that but I hate stuff like this, rollercoaster and such,\" I said into his neck. When we broke away when we heard Hannah and Trevor pulling into the place where we were. I knew I was blushing but I busied myself with getting out of the cart and walking over to Hannah. After she fussed over me we stared over at Trevor and Sean who weren't even close to each other and were staring at something behind us. When Hannah and I turned around we saw why. There was a cave and it was full of gems. I rushed over to it and watched as the light reflected off of their shiny surfaces. Unlike everyone else I was mesmerized by their look instead of their value. I felt the ground give a tiny crack and I looked over at Trevor. I think he realized it at the same time I did and suddenly said, \"Okay you guys I don't want anyone to move at all. We need to stay very still.\" I looked down and saw that the ground was thin and see through and I said at the same time as Trevor, \"We're standing on Muskovite.\" I saw Trevor look over at me appreciatively before explaining to a clueless Hannah and Sean. \"It's a very thin type of volcanic rock. In fact any change in pressure could cause it to crack and we could all fall through. So I want you guys to walk very slowly over to me, okay?\" We started walking slowly and then everything happened really quickly. A small diamond from Sean's bag fell out and onto the ground and we all held our breath. After about a second we thought it was safe to move, yeah we were so wrong. \"I want you two to stay together because we're about to fall,\" Trevor instructed and I grabbed Sean's hand in mine and intertwined our fingers. Then the floor gave way beneath us and we started falling. So apparently I'm changing up the story line, is that bothering anyone?[Chapter 5] So I still only have like one reviewer so this is still dedicated to xForevermore. Sean's Point of View: I gripped Scarlett's hand tightly in mine as we fell. And kept falling it was like there was no bottom to the hole; just a big mouth waiting to swallow us all whole. \"How are we still falling?\" Scarlett shouted over to Trevor. \"I don't know, I didn't think that it was possible to fall like this,\" Trevor said. \"I think should just play it down. Seeing as we can't really do anything about it.\" I noticed that Scarlett had started gripping my hand tightly again, whether or not I had a thing about heights I started to focus on her because she was silently freaking out beside me. I shifted over to her and pulled her into my arms. I felt her arms wrap around my waist and her hide her face in my neck. I kissed the top of her head whispered to her that it was going to be okay. And soon I felt her shoulders loose some of their tension but she still held tight to my waist. Then I felt water droplets hitting my face and looked around. There were little spots of water all around us that wasn't moving it was just suspended in midair. I looked over at Trevor and saw him in complete and utter amazement \"Okay so we could either hit a bunch of sharp rocks or we could hit some water,\" Trevor said after he regained his composure. \"If we hit water going this fast wouldn't we, like, explode?\" Scarlett shouted over to him, barely moving from my neck. \"Yes, if the water is a flat surface, but judging by the suspended water I'm thinking that it's going to go on an incline sort of like a waterslide,\" he said. \"Let's hope for a water slide then,\" I said, letting Scarlett move from my neck to be beside me. Then I felt my butt hit the water and I sucked in a mouth full of air before I went all the way under. I felt Scarlett let go off my hand and start swimming towards the surface. I kicked my legs quickly and made it to the top the same time as Hannah with Scarlett and Trevor right behind us. As soon as we all got to the shore we fell on our backs. When we looked up we saw something moving on the top of the cave, kind of like fluttering wings. \"What's that up there?\" Scarlett asked placing her head on my chest and continuing to look up. \"They look kind of like birds, except brighter.\" \"There's no way that birds could've survived underground like this. It must be the water's reflection,\" Trevor said standing up to get a better look. Then the thing started to move and the closer it got the more you could hear the fluttering of wings. So they must have been birds, I got up pulling Scarlett with me when the birds were in touching distance. The birds were glowing in the dark and a bunch of them decided to stay close to Scarlett. They were flying by her ears and taking her hair that had fallen down after her plunge into the water in their beaks, tugging on it to get her attention. I heard her giggling at them and I couldn't fight off my smile. \"So what's the deal with you and Scarlett?\" Trevor asked coming up behind me and placing his hands on my shoulders. \"I couldn't tell you. All I know is that I really like being around her and she makes me smile,\" I said, still watching her play with the blue birds. \"But she's so hard to read I'm almost afraid to like her. Not that I do or anything.\" \"Whatever you say. But to be completely honest, I think you're doing just fine in the flirting department. What with all of the touching her you're doing,\" he said smiling at me. I felt my cheeks catch on fire and turned away from him. Then I caught Hannah looking at him and turned to say, \"Trevor, I think the mountain guide is diggin' on you.\" This time he blushed and walked over to her and they started talking quietly. I looked over and saw one bird by itself floating in a dark section of the cave. I tapped Scarlett on the shoulder and got a peck on the finger from on of the birds. When she looked at me I pointed to the lone bird. \"Why do you think it's all by itself over there?\" I asked lacing my fingers through hers. \"I don't know, I think it wants us to follow it,\" she said taking a few steps in that direction. When she noticed that Hannah and Trevor hadn't heard her she said a little bit louder, \"I think this bird wants us to follow it.\" Without a second thought she went after the bird, dragging me behind her. I heard Trevor and Hannah's footsteps behind us and knew that they were following. Soon we were in a dark tunnel that seemed to not have an end. Then the bird let out a chirp and I started to see light and feel heat. Scarlett let out a sigh and soon I understood why, ahead of us was a utopia of beauty. She started running and I followed behind, unable to break her grip on my hand. Soon we came up to a tree that had a house sort of built into it. \"That's so freakin' cool. Let's go look inside,\" she said, trying to drag me up there but instead I pulled on her hand and we walked out onto the beach. I saw her kick off her shoes and walk barefoot so I followed her lead. Soon we were just standing there letting the waves lap at our feet. I turned to her and slid my other hand into her hair, turning her face to mine. I locked eyes with her as I leaned in but closed them when I placed my lips on hers. I felt her lips freeze under mine and I made to pull away only to have her grab the back of my head in one of her hands and placed the other one on the side of my face, holding me to her. I smiled and put my hands on her hips, pulling her closer. This was paradise. No way anything could ruin this. Review?[Chapter 6] I still only have one reviewer, xForevermore, so yet again that is who this chapter is dedicated to. Scarlett's Point of View: This was the first time that Sean had actually kissed me. Not one of those barely brushing my lips kisses or those kissed on the cheek or forehead, this is one of those kisses that you put all of your emotions into and kiss them like there isn't anymore air left in the world. When he pulled away I let out a little growl and tried to pull him back to me. Then I heard why he pulled away, a crunch of shoes on dirt. Trevor and Hannah were coming up on us; I pecked his lips once more and pulled away from him but keeping his hands in mine. I heard Trevor let out a whistle and Hannah smacked the side of his head. I rolled my eyes and saw Sean's cheeks darken and a kissed him lightly. He smiled and pulled me to the tree and I saw that there were steps leading up to the house. I went up first with Sean right behind me. Inside there was a hammock that I immediately jumped in and felt my muscles relaxing. I saw Sean roll his eyes and follow Trevor over to a box with a bunch of stuff in it. I figured I should leave them alone so I went down and joined Hannah. She was standing in front of a cluster of rocks and looking rather forlorn. I came up behind her and saw why, there was a skeleton with explorers' cloths on and I instantly knew that it was Sean's dad. I saw Hannah stand up and slid her hand into mine. \"Do you want to bring Sean down here and show him before I tell Trevor? Then take him off and comfort him by yourselves?\" she asked, pulling me close to her and placing a kiss on the top of my head. \"Yeah, let's go on up and I'll bring him down here,\" I said, walking up the steps into the tree house. I saw Sean and Trevor sitting in silence on the floor and walked over to Sean. I reached my hand down and he took it. After I pulled him up, I leaned over to whisper in his ear, \"Come with me baby, I have to show you something important.\" He nodded and walked over to the ladder going down the steps. I looked at Hannah and saw her whispering something to Trevor and I nodded my head at her and saw her give me a sad smile. Our plan was going into action. I took his hand in mine again as I came down from the steps and said, \"Sean I'm about to show you something really bad but Hannah and I figured that it would be better if I brought you down and she brought Trevor down. \"Hannah was walking along the beach and she came across this place where a lot of rocks where clustered together and she saw something in there,\" I said pulling him up to the rocks and tugging him forward. \"We're pretty sure that this is your father.\" Sean looked down and saw the skeleton and I saw him shake his head before saying, \"Yeah I had an idea that he was going to be out here. Trevor just read me a journal entry about my birthday, my third birthday. This just puts it all into perspective.\" I saw tears gathering in the corners of his eyes and I pulled him close to me. I felt him shake and I knew that he was crying, I pulled away and pulled him a little way down the beach and sat down. I pulled him down with me and pulled his face into my neck. I ran my fingers through his hair and felt him crying again. \"Shh, Sean it's okay. I've got you; I won't let anything hurt you. Shh, it'll be okay,\" I whispered as I stroked his hair. \"Do you want me to go get Trevor?\" He pulled away and I saw the tracks on his face and I placed my hand on his cheek. He leaned into it and said, \"I just want you to be here with me right now, okay? I don't want Trevor or Hannah; I just want to be with you.\" I felt tears pricking the back of my eyes as I pulled him back to me. I wanted him to feel better and I wanted it to be me that made him do it, I wanted to be his savior like he was mine. After he was finished he pulled me into his lap and kissed me lightly. I smiled and kissed him back and pulled away. He kissed my nose, cheeks, chin, hell he even kissed my eyelids. I had never felt so treasured in my whole life. I heard Hannah and Trevor talking quietly and knew she had taken him outside to the fallen Anderson. I smiled and lay my face in Sean's neck, kissing it a couple of times before I stood up and pulled him with me. We walked over to Hannah and Trevor and saw that he was hugging her and if I hadn't cleared my throat I'm pretty sure that they would've kissed. Trevor looked back at Sean and held out his arms, he walked into them and hugged his uncle. I walked over to Hannah and put my arm around her waist and she put hers around my shoulders. We stood there watching the guys we love mourn over their lost brother and father. After about ten minutes they broke apart and came over to us. Sean took my hand in his kissing the top of it. I saw Trevor kiss the top of Hannah's head and I winked over at her. She blushed and stuck her tongue out at me but I saw her smile nonetheless. \"I think we need to go back up into the tree house and look through the notes my brother took. I'm pretty sure that he had an escape plan,\" Trevor said. We walked up behind him and I lay down in the hammock. I felt Sean lay in behind me and pull me to his chest. We watched them look through the pages on the floor of the three house. I felt my eyelids start to get heavy. \"You can go to bed, I'll keep you safe. I'll always keep you safe,\" Sean whispered into my hair and kissed the tip of my ear. I nodded and felt my eyelids close and I fell asleep. I thought that was a sweet chapter, they both comforted each other :) But I seriously couldn't remember what was in the letter so I just made it work out like this so yeah... I hope it worked. REVIEW![Chapter 7] I got three reviews for the last chapter and I flipped shit. It was amazing, so thank you WritersWayOfLife , Trickster707 , and xForevermore . This is for you guys :) P.S. There is slight content in this chapter but I cut off before it got too graphic. Sean's Point of View: I felt Scarlett spazzing in my arms and I held her closer to me. She calmed down and I started to go back to sleep then she started to let out little groans and moans under her breath. I tried to shake her awake but she wouldn't budge. I heard her saying words under her breath but I couldn't make out what they were. I scooted closer to her and tried to make them out. They sounded kind of like my name but I couldn't be sure. We were alone in the tree house because Hannah and Trevor were outside gathering wood to make a raft so I could creep on her and they wouldn't know. She started to arch her entire body towards me and I decided that I should wake her up. I shook her shoulders and said her name until her big green eyes met mine. Her cheeks tinted a red color and she looked down to my chest. \"Hey what's wrong with you? Did you have a bad dream or something?\" I whispered as she burrowed into my chest. \"Yeah it was something like that,\" she said, still not meeting my eyes. Scarlett's Point of View: I was so insanely embarrassed right now you could fry bacon on my face. How do you tell someone that you just had a freakin' sex dream about them? It was a really hot dream that was totally about him and now he was asking me about it. Shit, what do I say to him? \"Oh, uhm, Sean it wasn't a bad dream, necessarily,\" I stuttered out. In all honesty I like what he did to me, not that I would EVER tell him that, or anything. We were lying in the hammock and Sean had his hand under my shirt and was rubbing my stomach. Then they started to move up and I arched into him leaning my head back onto his shoulder. He placed rough kisses up and down my neck, leaving little bite marks here and there, until he flipped me over and I landed on top of him. \"Sean, what are you doing? What if Trevor and Hannah come back in and see us like this?\" I asked franticly as he started pulling my tank top off. \"Stop worrying so much and just go with your feelings,\" he murmured into my neck as he ran his hands up and down my sides. \"But if you want me to stop just say so and I will. But if you want me to keep going, you know what to do.\" I groaned and ran my hands up the back of his shirt, yanking it over his head and off. Then I felt him hiss and I realized I had arched up and hit his erection. Whoops! When I moved I realized that it made something inside of me stir and I wanted more of it. He must have realized it to because he thrust into me, causing me to wrap my legs around his waist and arch again. \"Sean!\" I whimpered into his ear. Then I took his hair in my hand and I started tugging on it. His hand went up my back and when they go to my bra clasp I started to shake. I thought it was because I was feeling so much at once, but it turned out to be real Sean shaking me awake. Now we're back to where we were and Sean is still looking at me expectantly. I took a deep breath and looked at his chest before I whispered, \"I had a sex dream about you and I.\" Sean's Point of View: There is absolutely no way I heard her correctly, no way in hell. Had she seriously just said that she had a dream that we had sex? \"What did you say, Scar? I couldn't quite make it out,\" I said tilting her face up so I could see it. \"You dick, you so heard me. Don't make me say it again,\" she said, blushing really hard. I could see that she was close to tears so I stopped. \"Hey, it's okay. I didn't mean to make you upset. I'm sorry, please stop crying,\" I said hugging her close and whispering in her ear. \"I had one about you before I woke up too.\" I felt her cheeks heating up against my neck when I said that and I knew mine were also. Then out of nowhere she let out a giggle. Then I started squeezing her sides, making her giggle more. Soon I had her pinned down and I was tickling her on the sides. I didn't hear them walk in but soon Trevor and Hannah were sitting on the floor by the hammock watching us fight. I smiled over at them and continued to tickle her. Soon she had her hands behind my back and was punching the fuck out of it. \"Stop! It! You! Dick!\" she shouted, oblivious to the audience we had. \"Stop tickling me. I mean it, Sean, stop it!\" I stopped and sat up, pulling her into my lap. We turned to face Hannah and Trevor, waiting for them to start talking. They just smiled at us, kind of like they knew something that we didn't. Then everything fell into place, the raft was finished. \"Is the raft finished? Does that mean we're almost home?\" Scarlett said jumping out of my lap and running over to them, jumping up and down on her heels. \"Yes, it's done. Let's go and sail back home,\" Trevor said. He took Hannah's hand and pulled her up. I saw Scarlett shoot her a look that made her blush. \"Shut up.\" This was a Sean/Scarlett romance chapter, but keep in mind that they are 16 not 13 like in the movie. Jussayin'. Review![Chapter 8] Yep, here's another chapter :) 'Tis for xForevermore and Trickster707. Scarlett's Point of View: We walked out to the beach and Hannah and I jumped onto the raft as Trevor and Sean pushed it out into the water. After they jumped on they handed us handmade oars and started to paddle our way out to sea. Soon enough we were out and couldn't see land anywhere. The sky started getting darker and turned a purple color, shocking us all. I looked over At Trevor and saw him checking out the sky too with a worried look on his face. Soon he had scooted over to Hannah and I who were standing on the sides. \"I think it's getting ready to storm so I want you to come help me with the sail and let Sean take your place rowing,\" he said to Hannah. \"I think we can handle this, I mean it doesn't look like it's going to get that bad.\" \"Yes, because when we're at home and the sky is purple I think that it's going to be just dandy,\" I said, smiling as Sean let out a quiet laugh. \"Be quiet and row,\" Trevor said, but his cheeks turned a pale pink color making me giggle into my hand. \"We have to pay total attention to the raft and the water.\" I rolled my eyes and looked out at the sea. It was rolling and soon there were small waves forming here and there. Then I saw things landing on our raft, things that didn't look like rain. They were fish and they were falling from the sky. What the fuck? They were huge fish and they had insanely large teeth. There were at least ten of them on our raft and more were landing. I took a stick in my hand and started batting them away; soon enough everyone else got the idea and started hitting them too. \"Yeah, that's a great idea, Scarlett. Let's knock them back into the water,\" Trevor announced smiling at me before hitting a rather large one. After they were all gone I gave Sean a high-five and he kissed the top of my head. I heard Hannah let out a content noise and Trevor let out a cheer. But our celebrations were cut short when we saw the gigantic sea monsters jumping up on our raft too. \"What the hell are these things?\" Sean shouted to Trevor and took my hand in his pulling me closer to him. Seeing as the waves were getting bigger and the fish were making their on waves, rowing was pretty pointless, so I walked over and wrapped my arm around Sean's waist. I watched the monsters and saw that they were just eating the fish on the raft; they didn't want to hurt us. I saw Trevor grab the sail line and stir us out of the way, when we were out of trouble's way he let go. Suddenly a big gust of wind hit the sail and knocked it loose so Sean and I ran up to it and grabbed it. I felt it cutting into my skin, but I didn't let go. \"Hang on!\" Sean shouted at me as the wind picked us up and started taking us somewhere. \"Hold on to me!\" I heard Hannah and Trevor shouting from below but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I lost track of time but I remember waking up on a beach and being insanely thirsty. I made to stand up but felt my left wrist give way, I must have broken it when I landed. \"Sean?\" I shouted as I cradled my hurt arm to my chest. \"Sean, where are you?\" I walked until I saw a waterfall that looked so good. I hope it had clean water that I could drink. When I got close enough I saw a figure behind the falls. I picked up a rock in my good hand and held it up, ready top strike in case it was an animal. \"Scar? Scarlett is that you?\" a voice said as they made their way through the falls. \"Shit, put the rock down, it's me, Sean.\" I dropped the rock and ran to him. I threw my arms around his neck and jumped up into his arms. He wasn't expecting me to do that so he fell to the ground but didn't let go of my waist. I kissed him with everything I had and felt him eagerly kissing me back. When I broke free he locked eyes with me and said, \"I thought I lost you. I was so scared that I wasn't going to see you again. I was scared that I wasn't going to be able to tell you that I'm completely and irrevocably in love with you.\" I felt all the blood rush from my face and my mouth went dry. He loved me? We met like three days ago, is that enough time to fall in love with someone? Did that mean I was in love with him? I didn't get to respond because some big glob of goo fell from the sky and I barely rolled away fast enough for it to miss me and land on Sean's face. I held in my giggles as he wiped his eyes and sent me a glare. I looked up and saw something that made my blood run cold in my veins. There was a freakin' T-rex standing above, staring down. I let out a yelp and grabbed Sean's hand. We ran until I saw a cave and drug him into it with me. I saw one of the birds that we found way back had followed us in and it almost made me smile. The dinosaur was bashing the cave with its nose and I knew we were about to die. I took Sean's face in my hands and said, \"I love you so much it hurts me. I don't want to go back to my life without you ever. If I have to die I want to die right there with you.\" Then I pressed my mouth against him and left it there until I heard a knocking on the side of the cave wall. We broke apart and I heard a voice on the other side. \"Sean, Scarlett, are you guys okay in there? Can you hear me?\" I almost cried in relief when I heard Trevor's voice and when he broke through the cave I jumped out the gap and hugged him so tight I know he had trouble breathing. Then I let him go and grabbed Sean's hand. \"C'mon, this is a touching scene and all, but I really don't want to be a prehistoric happy meal,\" Sean said, tugging me away from the dinosaur behind us. There will probably be like two more chapters, just a heads up. Review :)[Chapter 9] So this had exactly 1,000 words and I thought it was cool . Sean's Point of View: I took Scarlett's hand in mine as we ran and couldn't help but smile, even in the light of what was happening right now. She loved me; she was in love with me! It was the greatest feeling in the world even though we're running from a dinosaur it's been the greatest day of my life. Scarlett's voice broke through my thoughts as she shouted, \"Trevor! What the hell are you doing? That looks just like Muscovite and there's no way it's going to hold all of our weight especially with a freakin' dinosaur behind us!\" I realized what she meant when I heard the tell-tall sound of the rock cracking below us. I pushed Scarlett ahead of me and made sure that she was safe before I full out ran off of the rock just as it caved through and Trevor fell through with the T-Rex. \"Trevor!\" I shouted as I ran over to the edge. \"No Trevor!\" I felt Scarlett wrap her arms around me and place her forehead against my back. Trevor was pretty much the only family that I had left. I turned around and hid my face in her hair and tried to calm my breathing. Then I felt her start jumping up and down. \"Sean, its Trevor! Hurry, help him up,\" she shouted and pushed me towards him. \"Hurry before he falls.\" I ran over to the edge and grasped his hands in mine. Then I pulled him up and hugged him close to me. I couldn't lose him, especially after I just found out about my father. I felt Scarlett lay a hand on my back and I understood what she meant. \"C'mon we have to go you guys. We're on a time sensitive mission,\" Trevor said pulling away from Sean but keeping his arm around his shoulder. \"We have to make it to the river in time for the geyser to blow. It's going to take us up and hopefully we'll get high enough to reach the actual Earth. So let's go!\" We walked towards the river and when we got there Hannah was standing on a floating dinosaur skull waiting for us to join her. We joined her and floated down the river, but soon we were scraping the ground. All of the water was gone. \"What's happening? Why isn't there any water?\" I asked Trevor. \"I thought you said that there was going to be a geyser. Where is it?\" \"We waited to long for it, it's gone now. I have an idea but it's incredibly stupid,\" Trevor said digging into Hannah's backpack. \"I'm going to throw this flare at the wall and hope it'll ignite.\" I shook my head and pulled Scarlett to me. She hid her face in my neck as Trevor threw the flare. It didn't catch. \"Why didn't it catch on fire?\" I asked. Trevor reached out and slid his hand up and down the wall. \"The wall's to wet for the flare to light. That means I'm going to have to get closer to the magma below us. I'm going to lean down I need you all to hold onto my legs.\" We grabbed them as he leaned down. When he threw the flare I heard it hit the wall and then I felt it ignite. The skull shot up and we all lay down on the bottom of the skull. I pulled Scarlett to my side and held her as close to me as I could. I looked up and saw the sky coming closer and Felt Scarlett scoot closer to me. Once we shot out of the top we started sliding down the mountain side. I saw Trevor stand up and watch as we slid. Then I sat up and pulled Scarlett between my spread legs and she lay back on my chest. She squeezed her eyes shut and tugged my hands into hers and placed them in her lap. Once we came to a sudden jolting stop I stood up, pulling her with me. I heard someone speaking a different language rapidly and I turned around to look at him. Apparently we took out someone's vineyard because it looked completely destroyed. Then I had and idea, I dug into my backpack and pulled out a large diamond. I tossed it over to him and heard him speak Italian and then walk away to what I assume was his house. I looked around and saw Trevor and Hannah kissing behind us. I shrugged my shoulders and got out of the skull, then I put my hands around Scarlett's waist, picking her up and out with me. Once she was out she left her arms around my neck and I left my hands on her waist. Then I leaned my forehead against hers and just looked into her beautiful green orbs. \"Is it to cheesy to say that I would redo this whole trip if it meant that I would end up right here with you in this very moment?\" he asked, giving her a shy smile. \"Yes, it's insanely cheesy but I think that cheesy is adorable,\" she said kissing the tip of my nose, \"I love you and it's totally fine that you're cheesy.\" I smirked at her and kissed her gently. I felt her sweep her tongue across my bottom lip and I smiled as I opened up for her. She ran the tip across my teeth then we started battling for dominance. Naturally I won and I started playing with it. \"Okay, come on you guys let's get back to America and Iceland,\" Trevor said. Then it hit me, I was going to Canada and she was going back to Iceland. We were going to be so far away from her. I don't know if I would handle that. When she looked up at me I saw that she was thinking the same thing that I was. I don't think I can live without her now. Yep, one more chapter then this story is finished :) Review please :)[Chapter 10] This is the last chapter. I had so much fun writing this story I'm sad to see that it's over now. Scarlett's Point of View: After we all got on a plane to go back home, we all realized how many diamonds Sean had in his backpack. So in a certain since he and Trevor were rich, I was happy for them about it. I just really didn't want to lose Sean. I was sitting in the seat with a sketch pad in my lap and I was sketching out the light birds that we saw down in the caves. I was putting special detail on one of them when I felt Sean place his hand on my knee and squeeze it slightly, making me look up at him. \"That's really good. I didn't know that you liked to draw,\" he whispered to me. Most of the people on the plane were asleep except for us. \"Yeah, I started drawing when I went on a school trip to Brazil my freshman year. There was all this amazing stuff that I couldn't capture on film because I couldn't bring a camera so I started to draw what I saw. It was an amazing experience. It's actually the reason that I became a vegetarian,\" I said, placing my pencil in the book and shutting it. \"You're a vegetarian? I didn't know that either. I guess we really don't know anything about each other,\" he said drawing his eyebrows together and looking down at his lap. I nodded and let his words sink in. We thought that we were in love and we didn't know the slightest thing about each other. I mean I didn't even know this kid's favorite color. We were really rushing into this, I just wonder if it was a bad thing. Sean's Point of View: I did love her, I just knew next to nothing about her. But the stuff I did know about her was amazing and I loved it. And even now learning about her art and her being a vegetarian I was even more in love with her. She was different than any girl I had ever met in my life, I loved that about her. When I looked over I saw her emerald eyes filling up with tears and when she started talking I realized why, \"Sean, this is so stupid. We say that we're in love but we barely know anything about each other. And you're going to Canada while I'm going back to Iceland with Hannah, how are we going to make this work? And is it even going to be worth it?\" I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I couldn't seem to catch my breath no matter how hard I tried. Was she saying that she didn't want to be with me? Once I gained the ability to speak again I said, \"What are you trying to say? Do you not want to be with me now?\" She looked like someone I slapped her in the face. She finally stammered out, \"N-no! Is that what you w-w-want?\" Then I saw the tears that had welled up in her eyes start pouring down her cheeks. I grasped her hand in mine and pulled her back to the bathroom. I glanced around before I pulled her in with me. She seemed a little bit flustered. \"I brought you in here because I wanted to talk to you and not have to keep my voice down because I'm afraid we're going to start shouting,\" I said then took a deep breath before continuing, \"I don't want to lose you ever, I don't know if I could handle not having you.\" She looked at me and I saw her thinking about something really hard. It felt like an eternity before she said, \"I wish life was that easy but we have to go back to out lives. Mine in Iceland and your new one in Canada.\" There was that breathless feeling again that left me gasping. I felt like I was the only one fighting for this relationship. Like she was just giving up, she didn't think I was worth a fight? Was she just giving up just because we were going to be so far apart? I mean we just survived a journey to the center of the Earth together, wasn't that something big? \"Are you seriously thinking that we should just give up on each other? After everything that we've been together?\" I asked through gritted teeth, trying to hold back tears I knew were going to come. She blinked her eyes hard and I saw tears falling down her cheeks. \"I'm not saying that I don't want us to be together, I'm just saying that it's going to be a hard relationship. But I'll work for it if you will too.\" I looked up at her and saw her grinning at me. Before I could help myself I crossed the small space between us and wrapped my arms around her. I pulled her up and off of her feet, pulling her as close to me as possible. I needed to have her close to me after the fear of losing her that just overcame me. When we finally broke apart I couldn't let myself drop her hand. I kept it in mine with out fingers intertwined and walked back to our seats. Once we got there I pulled her as close to me as I possibly could and felt my eyelids drooping shut. The last thing I heard before I fell asleep was Scarlett saying, \"I love you so much, I just hope I don't disappoint you.\" I was going to respond to her but I felt her lay her head back down and I decided to let her sleep. I hoped that I would still have time to tell her in the future. oOo Scarlett's Point of View: I woke up the next morning to see Sean smiling down at me. I remembered last night and couldn't help but smile back at him. I hated that we were going to be split up but I knew we could handle it. At least I hoped we could. Soon enough the pilot's voice came on over head telling us to prepare for landing. I felt Sean slide my seatbelt into place then his own. I tried to move my hand and felt the agonizing pain run through it from my fractured wrist we had fixed up in Italy. I looked down and saw why, our hands were still intertwined at the fingers and it had gone to sleep. \"Sean, can you let go off my hand? It's starting to hurt,\" I whispered to him. \"My wrist I mean.\" He looked down and instantly let go of it. I smiled in his direction and tried to rub feeling back into my palm. He took it from me and placed kisses from the tips of my fingers up to the end of the splint on my wrist. I felt my cheeks heating up and couldn't fight off the giggles that were pouring out of my mouth. \"Scarlett are you okay? You sound like a total ditz and that's not you at all,\" Hannah said from the row of seats behind us, \"I guess Sean really is changing you. For the best I hope.\" I rolled my eyes and looked back at her. She was cuddled up to Trevor like I was to Sean except she looked a lot happier than me. I don't understand why though. Shouldn't she be upset that he's going back to America and we're going to Iceland? I was going to ask but the plane started to jerk and I turned back around. I took Sean's hand again and leaned my head back, waiting for the landing. When it came I jolted a little bit but was okay seeing as I still had Sean's hand in mine. \"You may now safely exit the plane. Thank you for riding Con Air planes,\" the pilot said from somewhere up ahead as I grabbed my backpack heading off the plane. Sean took it off my shoulder and over his to join the pack on his shoulders. I rolled my eyes at his manners and walked a little bit behind Hannah and Trevor. This was going to be the hard part, leaving each other. \"Well I guess this is goodbye for all of us,\" Sean said, opening up his back pack and letting one of the birds from the trip fly out. \"I'm going to miss you guys so much.\" When he said this he looked directly at me. \"Actually Sean I called your mom and she said that you could move in with me and stay in America, I mean if you want to,\" Trevor said, flashing Sean a smile. \"I'll let Hannah explain the rest.\" \"Scar, how would you like it if we moved to America to be closer to them?\" she asked. I didn't think twice, I started jumping up and down like a total idiot. \"I would love that! Can we please? I won't ask to go to anymore exotic places that might kill me ever again, I promise,\" I said. \"Please?\" \"Alright then, it's decided. We'll be moving to America; do you guys want to come to Iceland and help us pack up our stuff?\" Hannah asked Trevor. It was pointless to ask Sean because we were already locked in an airtight embrace. Trevor however broke us apart to throw a book at Sean, \"Hey, I think this is going to be our next adventure, so read up.\" I smiled at the book in his hands, \"The Lost City of Atlantis\", it's like he was trying to kill us. We had just escaped from dinosaurs and monster fishes, now he wanted us to go adventuring underwater? Oh well, we'll have fun regardless. Thank you to everyone who reviewed, I love you all. It meant a lot to me :) ","Summary":" I'm rewriting this story because it was shit before. \"Please Hannah I really want to go; it would "},{"Movie":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","Title":"Vacation To The Centre Of The Earth","Author":"WritersWayOfLife","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7374129","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Here's a new story Disclaimer: I do not Own Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, just Ellie and any other characters I create. Enjoy! Ellie's POV \"Ellie! Can you come down here please!\" I heard my mom shout from downstairs. I shut my laptop lid, not wanting to risk my little brother sneaking into my room and reading my short stories, and headed downstairs. \"Uh oh, someone's in trouble.\" I heard a bratty voice say before Theo's obnoxious laughter filled my ears. \"Shut up bug!\" I shouted at him, turning around to face my nine year old brother. He only sneered at me. I glared back before turning and heading down the stairs. When I found my mom she was in the kitchen, stirring something in a bowl. It smelled like…chicken soup? Mom only made chicken soup if we were either ill or it was a special occasion, it was my favourite. I cleared my throat, alerting her to my attention. She turned around and gave me a weird smile. \"Hello dear.\" she started, coming towards me. I backed up slightly. \"What's going on mom?\" I asked her, wondering where all this special attention was coming from. My mom wasn't really the touchy feely type, which I didn't mind because neither was I. Mom knew I wasn't buying whatever act she was putting on. \"You're to much of my daughter to take any nice guy crappy act aren't you?\" she said, patting my arm before going back to her soup. \"Yeah. So what's the occasion?\" I asked, coming to stand next to her while she stirred the soup. She moved away and I took over, adding the necessary spices she always forgot. \"Well, my boss is asking me to see if I can relocate my job to a small place in Canada and I have to fly out there for a few weeks to check it out.\" she said. My eyes widened. We're moving to Canada? \"But mom, what about my friends? My school? My life?\" I asked, walking away from the soup to stand in front of her. \"You'll start a new life in Canada. I hear the people there are very nice.\" she tried to reason. \"But they can't replace my friends.\" I said back. \"Well what about that Sean Anderson boy? His mother said they should be moving near us around the same time.\" I grit my teeth. \"Sean Anderson is not my friend.\" I stated in a steely voice. We had never been friends, despite being in the same class since third grade. We just never got along. Well that could possibly be my fault considering that my friends insisted that I had a crush on him so I proved them wrong by pouring paint down his pants. He retaliated by shoving the class hamster, tinkles, down my shirt and we've been enemies ever since. My mom gave me a sympathetic look. \"Well that's to bad because you will be staying with him and his uncle in Boston while Theo and I go with his mother to check out our new neighbourhood.\" she said, quickly running over to the soup before it burned. I was speechless, trying to think of anything to say that could change her mind. \"And it's none negotiable. Just try to get along until we get back.\" she said, not even bothering to turn around. I glared at her back before running up the stairs of our two story apartment and into my room, slamming my door behind me. I stared at my room. Although it was a small piece of crap for a room, I had grown to love it. It even had its own fire escape that I could stand on and watch the stars. The only problem, the steps lead right up to Sean's apartment, which was right above ours. He would always play his music really loud just to annoy me. As if on cue to keep my worst night going, Sean's head popped through my open window. \"Hey! Crawford!\" he barked. I sneered at him in response. \"I just heard that you're goanna be staying with me and my uncle!\" I nodded, keeping my sneer in place. \"Yeah. I'm as happy about it as you are.\" I grunted sarcastically. He glared back at me. \"Considering that I don't want to see my uncle that much either I was hoping there was somewhere else you could stay.\" he asked, leaning on my window. \"Sorry but my mom said it was final. Why are you so bummed about seeing your uncle? It's about time you got a male authority figure in your life to keep you in check.\" I snapped back, wishing he would just leave. I received a glare so harsh I flinched back. \"Don't go there Crawford.\" he spat before turning and heading out the window. \"We leave on Saturday.\" he shouted behind him as he climbed back up to his room. I sighed as I slumped onto my bed. As much as I hate to admit it, that was a low blow to Sean. I knew very well that he had no dad. I also knew he cried about it sometimes at night. I don't think he realised how thin the floors were. I couldn't try to understand what it felt like to be dad-less. I had a dad but he was away at the moment. He should be back when I return from Boston. He was the greatest dad in the world, funny, caring, loving and he had a good job as a music promoter, which was why he is away right now in L.A. When sleep failed to claim me I stood up and reactivated my laptop. I reopened the page I had been writing on and clicked on new page. Dear Journal (Diary's are for girly girls) Today I found out that my family is moving to Canada. Know what that means? Dads goanna have Theo set on becoming a Hockey star. Joy. Me on the other hand am goanna have pretty much no one to talk to except (shudder) Sean Anderson. The bane of my existence and general pain in my ass. We're goanna be living in the same neighbourhood and going to the same school. We'll be roped in together as the two new kids who must be friends since they moved from the same place. Great, just great. Being sixteen sucks. Well I guess I'm going to have to get used to Sean and his whiney ass attitude. I suppose the best thing to do would be to apologise to him and see if we could be friends. Hell no! where's the fun in that? All I know journal is that the next couple of weeks are going to royally suck! Sean elbowed my knee for the sixth time that hour. We were sitting in his car, his mom driving, him in the front seat and me in the back behind him. As usual he was being a jerk, obnoxiously playing his PSP while his mom tried to talk to him and he just ignored her. He kept elbowing me then claiming it was just him getting too into his game. Bull shit! He's to crap to get to far enough into a game to use that excuse. \"So Elizabeth, are you excited about moving to Canada?\" Mrs Anderson asked me, looking at me through the rear view mirror. Not wanting to seem in-polite, I lied. \"Yeah, I can't wait.\" I said in an unenthusiastic sigh. I heard Sean snort and saw him smirk at me through his side view mirror. I responded by kicking his seat. \"Aww man! Why'd you don that? I was about to win!\" he yelled at me, turning in his seat. I smirked at him. \"Sorry, I was getting really into this story idea I was thinking about.\" I said in a smug tone. Sean glared at me, knowing that his mom knew that I liked to write so it was a valid excuse. \"Bitch.\" he mumbled under his breath. I kicked his seat again and he turned around again. \"Do that one more time…\" he threatened, leaning forwards. I smirked again, leaned forwards and flicked him between the eyes. \"That's it!\" he yelled, taking off his seatbelt and leaping into the back seat. My eyes widened as he pinned me against the back seat, not expecting that. I fought back of course, swatting at him multiple times. His mom slammed on the breaks, causing him to fly back, bounce off the front seat and fall flat out onto me. I blushed deeply as his eyes locked on mine, his nose banging against mine painfully. \"We're here now stop fighting!\" his mom demanded. Sean was blushing furiously as he scrabbled off me, pretty much falling out the car as he scrambled out the door. I just sat up, laughing as he ran round the car to grab his bag. I climbed out the car, looking up at the large building. I noticed a man on the first floor through a large window, running around with plates in his arms. I was about to ask if he was Trevor Anderson, but was cut off by my bag being thrown into my face by an angry Sean. \"Nice catch.\" he snickered as he walked up to the front door. I could tell already that this 'vacation' was going to suck. Hope you liked it, Review![Chapter 2] Here's Chapter two and i hope you read my PM Indigofrisbe. Am waiting for your Reviews Enjoy! Sean's POV I can't believe how quickly this trip turned from god awful to just plain crap. Not only did I have to spend a boring ten days with my crazy uncle, I was now going to be stuck living near Ellie Crawford for the rest of high school…in Canada. My life just keeps getting better and better. Not! We were currently sitting in my moms car as she talked to uncle Trevor. Ellie was still sitting behind me in the back, gathering her stuff together. I was still pissed at her for ruining my perfect game, but I was more pissed at what had happened in the back seat. I can't believe she provoked me into jumping into the back, and then my mom causes me to fall on her? What was the worst part though, I didn't completely hate being that close to Ellie. In fact...it was kinda nice. I quickly shook my head, ridding it of these insane thoughts before going back to my game. I felt two fingers on my head before my beanie had been plucked from my head. \"Hey!\" I snapped. \"Give that back!\" I demanded, twisting in my seat to face her. She just smirked at me before pointing out the window. \"Your uncle's coming.\" she said. I glared at her before snatching my hat back and putting it back on. Just as I was getting back into my game, he tapped on the window. \"Hey Sean! Looking good.\" he said, trying to make conversation. I ignored him. \"Is that one of those game boys?\" he asked. I rolled my eyes. \"It's a PSP.\" Me and Ellie said at the same time, me not looking up. I was surprised that Ellie, a girl, would know about guy stuff like that. \"Cool.\" Trevor said, sounding defeated. I heard a sigh behind me before Ellie got out the car. \"Hi. My name's Elizabeth Crawford but you can call me Ellie.\" she said, holding out her hand for him to shake. He shook it, smiling down at her. \"Hi Ellie, I'm Trevor. You're pretty, are you Sean's girlfriend?\" he asked and I chocked on my spit. Ellie had a similar reaction, blushing furiously. \"No, I'm definitely not his girlfriend. I'm his neighbour and am being looked after by you guys while my mom looks at a house in Canada.\" Ellie explained. It hurt a little that she didn't even say she was my friend, but I guess I deserve that, like I care. \"Sean, will you say hey to your uncle?\" mom asked me. I sighed as I turned off my game and got out of the car, pulling my bag with me. \"Hey to your uncle.\" I mumbled sarcastically as I stopped in front of him, my face a bored thrown. He smiled down at me. \"Last time I saw you, you were this big.\" he said as he pointed at my chest. I looked down, only to have him flick his finger at my nose. He laughed but I just glared at him. \"Yeah very funny.\" I mumbled again. Ellie was shaking her head at me but I didn't care if she thought I was being a dick. I walked back over to my mom, who handed me my other bag. \"Ok you've got your cell-phone, my numbers in there just in case. Your passports in your bag and I will be at the air port to pick you and Ellie up.\" great, we were living on the same street. \"Soon we'll be off on our own adventure.\" I rolled my eyes . \"Yeah thrilling, we get to be Canadian. Aye.\" I added dryly. Ellie was glaring at me but I knew se was thinking the same thing. One thing that I knew about her was that we hated pretty much the same things, one being the idea of being Canadian. I started walking towards the house, Ellie following. \"Just let yourself in.\" uncle Trevor called behind us. I rolled my eyes again, considering he'd left the door wide open. I walked through and instantly sneered at the state of his home. Papers littered, well everything. Dirty plates covered almost every table top and there were some trophies from his collage days. I heard Ellie give a disgusted grunt. \"What a piece of crap!\" she muttered. \"You guys expect me to stay in a dump like this?\" I turned at her and smirked. \"I thought this would be a step up from what your used to.\" I was met with her chucking something at my head, a book. It clipped the side of my face, leaving what would probably become a large bruise. \"Ow! You dumb-\" I started but was cut off by uncle Trevor. \"Hey guys, this is going to be fun huh? Just us guys.\" Ellie glared at him. \"A-and girls.\" he said sheepishly. I smirked again. \"No, you had it right the first time.\" again, Ellie chucked a book at me, this time missing me. \"Anyway we could spend five days, maybe a week, just doing dude stuff.\" he said with a shrug. \"Maybe we could hit the batting cage.\" he said, miming hitting a ball out the park. I rolled my eyes, faking a smile. \"Yeah. Anyway I don't like this anymore then you do so as long as you keep the fridge stocked with mountain dew, and tivo family guy we'll get on fine.\" I grunted before walking off. Ellie sighed. \"Don't mind him, he just always acts like he's got a metal rod shoved up his butt. The best time to talk to him is just after a good family guy episode, at least that way he's still thinking about the jokes and he's in a better mood.\" I sneered at her, hating that she knew me so well. I spotted some jars full of coins and couldn't help but comment. \"Wow, that's an awesome coin collection.\" I said sarcastically. Ellie scoffed. \"Sean, just be nice.\" she warned. I scoffed. \"Well it's kind of a pet project of mine.\" Trevor mumbled, adding a few coins to one of the jars. \"Yeah it's really nifty.\" I said with fake enthusiasm. \"Thanks.\" Trevor said bluntly, seeing right through my act. \"Hey do you wanna order in. we could get pizza, Tai, Chinese, subs something like that?\" he asked. \"I could go for some Chinese.\" Ellie piped up. Trevor smiled at her. \"Alright, at least someone's making an effort.\" I grunted, figures he'd get along with her better. Everyone always liked her better. I heard something thump and turned back to uncle Trevor and Ellie. It was then that I finally noticed that uncle Trevor was carrying a cardboard box. He opened it, chuckling slightly at whatever was inside while Ellie's face screwed up slightly in confusion. \"What's that?\" I asked, taking a step closer. Ellie shook her head, looking up at me. \"I don't know but it looks like junk.\" she said as she took a few steps back. Trevor sighed. \"This is a box of possessions owned by a really great guy… your dad.\" he said, looking up at me. Ellie's eyes widened as she stared at me. I found myself taking more interest, smiling as I came to stand closer. He began taking stuff out and showing it to me. One was a yo-yo. While I wasn't impressed at first, he started to do some really cool stuff with it and soon I was walking the dog and doing other tricks while he was looking at a book. \"Journey To The Centre Of The Earth? Hey Sean, wasn't that on our summer reading list last year?\" Ellie asked, tapping me on the shoulder. I waved my hand at her, to focused on the yo-yo. \"Yeah yeah I just never got to it.\" I mumbled. She scoffed at me, walking over to uncle Trevor to look at the book. I hooked the yo-yo around her ankle as she went, smirking as I tugged at it and pulled. Her feet got tangled and she ended up falling backwards into me. \"Whoa!\" I cried, dropping the yo-yo to catch her under her arms. Her shoulders fell against my chest and her head landed against my neck, her gasp sweeping across my neck and making me shiver. Something about this position made my heart stop and I just stared at her, taking in all her features, from the darker then usual freckle to her sparkling green eyes. \"Uh Sean…I know you're probably enjoying this position, considering where your hands are, but you should know that if you don't move them soon I will personally make sure that the yo-yo becomes a registered hunting weapon again on your skull.\" she growled at me. It was then that I realised that, while wrapping my arms around her upper torso had helped in catching her, it had also made me pretty much palm her breasts. \"Gahh!\" I yelped, leaping away from her. This just caused her to fall onto the floor. She glared up at me as she pushed herself up. \"Sorry.\" I mumbled weakly. She just rolled her eyes before going over to uncle Trevor. I picked the yo-yo back up again, deciding to practise more. Just as I was getting good with the around the world, trying to get uncle Trevor and Ellie's attention while they were busy talking about Bolivia, Mongolia and other countries, the yo-yo flew from my finger, soaring into the air. \"Watch out!\" I shouted as it crashed into a bouncy ball sculpture above their heads. Ellie screamed as the balls pounded onto her and uncle Trevor's heads, covering hers with her hands while uncle Trevor just stared at my dads book. \"Sean you complete idiotic jerk!\" Ellie screamed at me. I suddenly felt really bad, having Ellie mad at me. I don't know why, after ten years of hating her, Ellie had me feeling bad about hurting her feelings. She must be a witch! \"I'm sorry Ellie, it was an accident.\" I said hurriedly. \"Oh and know you're goanna act all smug an-wait what? You're sorry?\" she asked me, tilting her head to the side in confusion. I nodded, awaiting a smack or something. Before my fate could come to an untimely end however, uncle Trevor interrupted us. \"Hey guys, lets go check out my lab.\" he said, grabbing his coat. Before we had time to even think of protesting he was hustling us out the door. There it is. Am already loving your Reviews. I want to hit five before I update again! Like I've said before, CHECK OUT SOME OF MY OTHER FICS! PREFERABLY THE LESSER REVIEWED ONES![Chapter 3] Here's chapter three! Enjoy! Ellie's POV Sean is planning something, he must be. Why would he start being nice to me if he wasn't plotting my downfall? We were currently sitting in his uncle Trevor's 'lab' which was more of a classroom then a lab. He was babbling on about how physics was the science of today while typing on his computer while Sean was grumbling and whining about how we should have waited until tomorrow. I took this time to study him, thinking that maybe I missed something. He was still wearing his beanie, hiding his chocolate hair that looked so soft. His brown eyes were looking weary with the lack of sleep we had had today, but they still held that little sparkle that let me know he was thinking of something snaky to say to lighten the mood. As my eyes travelled southwards I realised, for the first time, that Sean had not only grown taller then me but he had muscle on his arms and chest. \"Hey, Ellie, are you ok?\" I heard his voice say and quickly shook my head, ridding me of my mixed thoughts. \"Yeah, just tired.\" I mumbled. He nodded before turning back to his uncle. I followed suite, deciding I needed a distraction. \"Here it is.\" he said, pointing at the computer screen. It was full of countries and seismic activity ratings. Only three names were highlighted. \"You see: Mongolia, Bolivia and Hawaii. And the conditions today are almost exactly the same as they were in July 97.\" he said. Sean looked confused. \"What happened in July 97?\" he asked. Trevor gave him a sorry look. \"Sean that's the year your dad went missing.\" he said, sounding sad himself. Sean lowered his gaze from the screen and I knew that he was thinking about his dad again. I felt sorry for him and patted his back, trying to be comforting. He looked up at me, his brown eyes giving me a silent thanks. Our moment was interrupted by Trevor, who was pointing at his screen. \"See now this level reads 753. If it read 752 then it would be…\" he stopped when I pointed at the screen. \"It does say 752.\" I said. His eyes widened. \"Exactly the same.\" he murmured. Sean shifted beside me and I turned, letting Trevor drool over the numbers, to see him looking at a computer screen. It held an image of a world map with four little red dots over four different countries. Mongolia, Bolivia, Hawaii and Iceland. \"Hey what do these little blips mean?\" he asked, tapping the screen. \"Hey don't touch anything, those little blips are my life's work.\" \"These four little blips are your life's work?\" he asked. \"Three, three little blips.\" he said, holding up three fingers and not taking his eyes of his screen. Sean raised his eyebrows as he twisted the computer screen around. I tapped Trevor on his shoulder and he turned to look. \"One, two, three…four.\" Sean said, tapping each blip. Trevor looked over at us and his jaw dropped. \"Iceland.\" he whispered. \"This makes sense.\" Trevor said as he rushed into his house, me and Sean trailing behind him. I was officially too tired to ask many questions but Sean seemed wide awake. \"Max saw the readings ten years ago and he took off to investigate. Now if the readings are the same today as they were then…then maybe this is a chance to finally find out what happened.\" he ranted while I flopped down into one of his chairs. \"Sean, Ellie, you two are going to need your passports.\" he said as he began packing a backpack. This perked some interest from me. \"For what?\" me and Sean said at the same time. I blushed but looked away. \"I'm sorry guys but I'm going to need to get you to Canada a little earlier then I planned.\" he said. That I didn't like. \"What are you talking about?\" Sean asked, looking a little mad. \"I'm talking about this: A Journey To The Centre Of The Earth. It was set in Iceland which is where Max must of gone.\" Trevor explained as he threw the book at Sean. I looked over at the book and saw that the pages were littered with scribbled notes. \"These are my dads notes?\" Sean asked, flicking through the notes. \"Look…\" Trevor started, looking at Sean. \"…Max and I…Your dad and I were talking about the possibility of volcanic tubes existing…that went down past the mantle, towards the centre of the earth.\" I snorted. \"That's impossible.\" I said and Trevor glared at me. \"And I think that's what he went looking for. I gotta get you guys on a flight to Canada and then call Iceland-air.\" he said as he picked up the phone. Sean and I shared a look before Sean stood up to Trevor. \"No, no, look.\" Sean said as he unplugged the phone. \"Hey.\" Trevor complained. I rolled my eyes. \"I just got here ok? Your not getting rid of me that easily.\" he argued. He then glanced at me and his eyes softened. \"Or Ellie.\" now he was defending me? \"And besides, we were the ones who found your life's work fourth blip thingy in the first place.\" now he's including me? Ok something's definitely wrong with him. \"Whoa that's my brother you're talking about.\" Trevor responded. \"Yeah and he's my dad!\" Sean snapped back. I had never seen him act so passionately about something before. \"Now me and Ellie don't have to be in Ottawa for ten days. We're going with you.\" he said with a finalised tone. Trevor raised his eyebrows. \"Do you know how much it costs to book three last minute flights to Reykjavik?\" Trevor asked. \"Something tells me you got it covered.\" Sean responded, pointing at Trevor's coin jars. I sighed, standing up and heading out the room. \"Ellie? Where are you going?\" Sean called after me. \"Getting my stuff!\" I shouted behind me. As I was walking into my room, I could hear Trevor and Sean talking. It seemed to be about me so I tiptoed back over to the doorway. \"She's pretty grumpy sometimes.\" Trevor commented. I'm grumpy. I thought I was just tired, but if he thinks I'm always like this… \"Give her a break, it was a long drive up here and she hasn't slept since we picked her up this morning, at .\" why was Sean sticking up for me again? \"Why are you defending her? I thought you two hated each other.\" Trevor asked. Thank you, now I might get some answers. \"Well…I don't exactly, you know…hate her.\" Sean mumbled and I could practically see him blushing. I on the other hand felt a little happier. Sean didn't hate me? Did I still hate him? I guess I'll find out soon enough. I could hear Trevor chuckling. \"You like her. You like her. Sean likes a girl.\" he sung childishly. He's like my elementary school friends all over again. \"Shut up Trevor. I'm going to bed.\" Sean grumbled. I quietly bolted from the hall and leaped into my bed. I heard the door open and felt light flood onto my face. I kept my eyes closed as I heard a sigh that sounded like it came from Sean. \"I don't know what it is about you that makes me hate and like you at the same time.\" he mumbled before he shut the door and walked off. Feeling my eyes grow heavy, I decided to sleep on my confused thoughts, only one question in my mind. 'What if I had responded when he said that?' I gulped as we all found our seats on the plane. I didn't like planes, something this heavy shouldn't be able to fly. I slipped into the window seat, Sean next to me and Trevor on the end. As the captain started his usual safety terms and flight times, I started my inner breathing cycle to keep calm. In, out, in, out. That all amounted to nothing when the plane started moving. My hands flew to the arm rests and I gripped them for dear life. Take off was the worst part because all I can imagine at this moment is the plane not being able to lift, the pilot loosing control and all of us dying in a horrible explosion as the plane crashes into the airport. As we picked up speed I shut my eyes, my head starting to feel light. \"Hey Ellie, is everything ok?\" Sean asked. I shook my head, keeping my eyes closed. \"I don't like planes. I'm fine with heights but something this big and heavy shouldn't be able to fly.\" I said in one breath. I could feel my hands hurting as I continued to squeeze any life out of the arm rests. Suddenly the pressure on my right hand lessened, also becoming warm. I cracked open my eyes to see Sean gently taking my hand in his, rubbing it gently with his thumb. \"Everything's goanna be fine, Ellie. Don't worry.\" he said calmly in my ear. I shivered at his breath against my neck. I looked up at him and smiled thankfully. There was a second there, a moment where all I could see were his eyes, his soft caring coffee brown eyes. He must have leaned closer then I anticipated when he whispered to me. He was staring right at me, his gaze never wavering from my green eyes until they flickered down to glance at my lips. He started leaning in and I started doing the same, all thoughts fleeing my brain. Just as I thought he was going to kiss me, the plane jolted as it left the runway. I gasped and buried my face in Sean's neck. He stiffened but rubbed my back soothingly. \"Why don't you try and get some more sleep?\" he said quietly. I nodded. I hadn't gotten much sleep last night, to busy thinking about how awful this take off was going to be. I was about to pull away, but Sean kept his arm around my shoulders. \"You can stay. It's better then the window.\" I sighed and let my head drop onto his shoulder, falling into a surprisingly easy sleep. Review![Chapter 4] Here's Chapter 4 Enjoy! Sean's POV We had been sitting on the plane for three hours when Ellie finally stood up. \"I need to use the bathroom.\" she grumbled as she squeezed past, brushing against my legs. I gulped as I watched her head towards the bathroom. Uncle Trevor was asleep, his 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' book sitting in his lap. Feeling an unsettling stirring sensation in my stomach, I got up, hopped over uncle Trevor and headed for the bathroom. I waited until Ellie came back out. She jumped when she saw me standing there, blocking her way. \"Sean, what are you doing?\" she asked when I refused to move. I looked right, then left, before I pushed her back inside and followed, fumbling to close and lock the door. We were so close, pressed against each other. There was barely enough room for one. The sensation in my stomach returned, turning into carnal need. Wrapping my arms around her waist, I kissed her fiercely. She barely resisted, kissing me back with force while running her fingers through my hair. She did always like to be in control. I pressed into her urgently, grinding my hips against her own. She groaned with content, spurring me on. The tiny counter was barely big enough for the sink, but somehow I managed to roughly hoist her onto it. Ellie gasped when she felt my hands on her thighs, running over the skin that wasn't covered by her jean shorts. Embarrassed, she tried to push my hands down, but I pushed her knees apart and stepped between her legs. \"I want you,\" I murmured against her lips. I'm sure she felt my hand in her hair, surely tangling it, but she didn't care. She slid forward and wrapped her legs around me. It only made it worse. My fingers were fumbling with the buttons on her shirt. She helped me half way down, and my hands were there, touching her and teasing her. There was pounding on the door, \"I have to use the john!\" \"I'm busy!\" I yelled back, trying not to let Ellie's kisses against my throat show. \"Come on, pal,\" the guy retorted, \"Other people have to take a piss.\" \"Try another stall. I'm going to be a while!\" I replied. The guy said something else, but I was already back, gently nibbling on Ellie's lip. She tasted so good. She tasted sweet, like cherry lip gloss and diet coke. She tasted pure. Her hands found the top of my jeans. A finger squeezed beneath the waistband, running along the edge, just testing me. She was rocking against me now, earning a groan from me. I pulled back, kissed her right cheek, then her left. Her forehead. Her nose. For a moment I just stared into her eyes, stared into the girl who had been driving me crazy for ten years. I was searching for something. Something greater than the both of us. I felt her head nod slightly as I held her face between my hands. It was a slow nod that became more vigorous. She gently kissed me, the intimacy behind it making me pause to settle my heart. \"Yes, Sean,\" she whispered, pressing a kiss to my ear, \"Do it.\" I started awake in my seat, jumping forwards so vigorously I hit my head against the seat in front of me. \"Ow…\" I mumbled, rubbing it. Trevor gave me a confused look. \"You alright kiddo? You don't look so good.\" he asked. I realised that I was sweating and panting. I nodded, rubbing at my eyes and face. \"Yeah, just…a freaky dream.\" I sighed. \"You're a little old for the bogey man aren't you?\" he asked with a chuckle. I glared at him before switching my gaze to the window. It was then that I noticed that Ellie wasn't in her seat. \"Where's Ellie?\" I asked, shifting in my seat. \"She went to the bathroom.\" he mumbled, looking back at the notes he had scattered over his seat and pinned to the seat in front of him. I gulped, images of my dream flooding my mind. \"Are you sure you're alright Sean? you look a little flustered.\" Trevor pushed. \"I'm fine I just need a distraction!\" I said harshly, picking up my PSP. \"Hey, can you guys move back a bit?\" came Ellie's voice. My blush exploded across my face as me and uncle Trevor looked up at her at the same time. He nodded shuffling backwards, but I was frozen. Ellie gave me a funny look. \"Uhh Sean?\" I jumped again, shuffling back and tried not to look up at her when she squeezed past, her front pressed up against me. She flopped back down into her seat, blowing up a few strands of dark blonde hair that had fallen in front of her face. I couldn't take my eyes off her, wondering what it would be like to run my fingers through her hair. \"Sean, you alright?\" I was broken from my third trance by her voice. I nodded. \"Yeah, just thinking about something.\" I said before looking back down at my PSP. I felt uncle Trevor tap my arm and looked over at him. He had the biggest smirk ever on his face. \"Someone likes Ellie.\" he giggled quietly. I thought we settled this last night. \"I told you last night. I don't like her.\" I whispered quietly. \"Then why does it seem like you don't want her to hear you say that?\" he asked smugly. I narrowed my eyes at him, ready to punch him right in his face. \"What are you working on Trevor?\" Ellie asked, speaking over my shoulder. Trevor smiled at her. \"I am deciphering these notations left by Sean's dad in this book. I think there's a code behind the pairing of letters It might have something to do with the periodic table. For instance. I've got S-A, I-S, G-G. I believe that P-B is on the periodic table and that's plumbum. Plumbum means lead.\" Trevor explained, pointing to the letters in the book. I noticed that the letters spelled something. \"What's 'Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson'?\" I asked confused. \"What?\" Trevor asked looking over at me. \"Well, it's right here. Read it down. Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson.\" I told him, dragging my finger down the name on the book. \"Oh. Uh... Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson, that's... That's a clue. Maybe that's a place. It could be a thing.\" Trevor ranted. I looked at Ellie and we rolled our eyes. I picked up my PSP and typed it up on Google. \"What are you doing?\" Trevor asked looking over at me. \"I am Googling at 30,000 feet.\" I told him bluntly. \"Cool.\" Ellie said. \"Are you supposed to be doing that?\" Trevor asked looking at the PSP. \"Welcome to the 21st century.\" Ellie said with a smirk. I shot a grin at her. \"Okay. Here.\" I said. Ellie took the book from Trevor and looked through the pages. \"It's a person.\" Trevor said. Ellie closed the book and leaned over my shoulder, trying to get a better look. I gulped at her hands, which had wrapped around my upper torso. \"\"Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson, executive director... of Asgeirsson Institute for Progressive Vocanology.' Max would've known this guy. I knew it was a good idea to bring you two. His institute has gotta be our first stop.\" Trevor said going off into his thinking place. I sighed and smiled slightly, going back to my PSP. After a few minutes of watching me play, Ellie gestured to it. \"Can I play with it?\" she asked. I shrugged and handed it over. This is going to be a long plane ride. \"Are we nearly there yet?\" I asked for the fifth time. We were currently in a stupid rental car halfway across Iceland. I was in the front, Trevor was driving and Ellie was in the back behind me. We were all tired, bored and I don't know about the others but I was starving. \"If you mean annoying, then yeah, we're there.\" Trevor said. I sighed leaning my head back against the head rest and looking out the window. \"You know, you're going kinda slow.\" I said looking over at Trevor. \"I'm going kind of safe.\" Trevor said. \"Nope you're going really slow. I just saw a goat in the passing lane.\" Ellie said. I laughed and Trevor looked back at me with hurt in his eyes. \"When's the whole adventure thing goanna begin?\" I asked. \"Let me give you two something fun to do. Navigate,\" Trevor said giving me a map, \"Where are we?\" \"Have we passed Havanschlicht?\" I asked, unfolding the rest of the map. \"Havanschlicht?\" Trevor asked. \"Yeah,\" Ellie confirmed, looking at the map over my shoulder. \"I don't know.\" Trevor said. \"Have we passed Eingarsstadir?\" I asked looking at the map. \"I don't know.\" Trevor said. \"Reynivir?\" Ellie asked. \"I don't know.\" He growled. \"Husavik?\" I asked. \"No.\" Trevor said. \"Grundarhol?\" Ellie asked. \"No.\" \"Stifflarschtarder?\" I asked. \"Stifflarschtarder?\" Trevor asked in disbelief. \"How about Koldukardarskinoquue?\" I asked. \"What?\" Trevor asked. Ellie laughed. \"We're definitely lost.\" I stated. \"We're not lost.\" Trevor said. \"Yeah we really are.\" Ellie said. \"Just look for an institution.\" Trevor said sighing. \"What's an institution look like?\" I asked. \"I don't know, it looks big and institutional. It's gotta be around here somewhere.\" Trevor said, sounding irritated. \"Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.\" Ellie said, pointing out in front of us. \"We can stop there and ask for directions.\" I said opening the car door. \"We're not lost.\" Trevor said firmly. \"Oh, no, definitely not.\" Ellie said, sarcasm dripping off every word as I opened her door for her. \"Thanks?\" she said with a confused frown on her face. \"No problem.\" I mumbled back, my thoughts still a little preoccupied. The air was freezing and I was already shivering. Ellie looked like she was enjoying the cold almost as much as I was. \"What is this? A ski shack?\" Trevor asked. I held my flashlight up to the sign. \"'Asgeirsson... Institute for Progressive Vocanology?' Aha. See I told you two I'd find it.\" Trevor gloated. \"You didn't find it, you happened to drive the right way. It's called luck.\" Ellie said. \"Alrighty. Not to shabby.\" Trevor said completely ignoring her. If only I could do the same. \"All right.\" she said. When we got to the door Trevor knocked and a woman's muffled voice sounded through the door. I would be happy that we have someone to talk about this with if she wasn't speaking in Icelandic. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.\" Trevor apologized, grinning down at us humorously. I just raised my eyebrows at him as we waited for the door to open. Hope you liked it and i'm glad you are checking out my other stories Indigofrisbe Review![Chapter 5] Thanks for the great Reviews! will update again soon but I have a lot of project work to do for collage. Enjoy! Ellie's POV I stood shivering in the cold Icelandic air. We were still waiting for the woman who answered Trevor's shout to open the door. Sean was next to me, fighting to keep himself from shivering. \"You cold?\" I asked. He looked at me and cleared his throat. \"Oh no, I never feel cold.\" he said nonchalantly, adding a shrug. At that moment an extra cold gust of wind swept across us and we all shivered violently. \"Don't get cold huh?\" I said smugly, smiling at him. He gave a 'what are you goanna do' grin and I chuckled. What was happening to us? A week ago we couldn't stand to be within fifty feat of each other and now were falling asleep on each others shoulders, laughing at each others jokes and he was defending me. We were acting like…friends. I felt like I was going to be sick. Finally the door opened and in the doorway stood a very pretty blonde woman opened the door. She looked tired, but had bright blue eyes. I smiled at her I looked at Sean to see his reaction. I didn't like it. He was smiling like an idiot and there was a faint tint to his cheeks. I looked away, scowling at the floor. \"Hi, can I help you?\" the woman asked. \"H-hello,\" Trevor stuttered. I sighed. He's making it difficult. \"I'm Hannah.\" she said thrusting her hand forward and smiling slightly. \"Hi, my names Ellie, and this is Trevor and Sean.\" I said stepping forward and shaking it. \"Oh, how do you do? Hi,\" Trevor said finally shaking her hand, \"I'm Trev- Professor Anderson. I'm visiting from America. Um... This Sean, my nephew, and Ellie, his fri-neighbour. As she already told you.\" Trevor said pointing to me. Hannah shook Sean's hand. I rolled my eyes as he smiled like an idiot. I was not jealous. \"I was wondering if I could possibly speak with, forgive me here... Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson?\" Trevor asked. \"Um...Well, Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson is dead.\" Hannah said with a saddened tone. \"Dead?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah, he died three winters ago.\" Hannah clarified. \"Oh, Uh... So do you run the institute?\" Trevor asked. \"Nobody does. There is no institute.\" Hannah told us. Really? We came here for no reason then. \"There's a sign down the road that says-\" \"Progressive Vocanology was a failed idea.\" Hannah informed cutting him off, \"Like, you know, the Berlin Wall and eight-track tapes.\" I snickered at the last one. \"I see.\" Trevor said disappointment written clearly across his face. \"Well, did you work with him?\" \"No, no. He was my father.\" Hannah said. I grimaced. \"So sorry.\" I said. She smiled weakly at me. \"Thank you. Would you like to come in?\" she asked. \"Yes!\" Sean and Trevor said at the same time. I rolled my eyes at them and Sean blushed heavily. \"I'm cold.\" he defended. I gave him a 'yeeeaaah' look before following Hannah inside. I sat down at a table and watched as she placed four cups on the table. Trevor slid the book over to her and looked at her expectantly. Her eyebrows rose up, so did mine. Like that said anything \"Yeah? I know it. What about it?\" she asked turning to stir the hot chocolate on her stove. \"Well, this book belonged to my late brother, Max. Max Anderson? We believed that he may have been in contact with your father.\" Trevor said. \"Your brother was a Vernian.\" Hannah stated pouring hot chocolate in the cups. \"What's a Vernian?\" I asked. Sean had the same questioning look as me. \"Someone who believes that the writings of Jules Vern were actual fact. The guy was a science fiction writer and yet this society regarded him as a visionary. My father was the biggest of them all.\" Hannah said while passing the cups around then sitting down. I felt my glare coming back as Sean grinned stupidly when Hannah handed him his cup. I'm not jealous! I'm not jealous! I looked back at him from the corner of my eye. He was staring at me, a glassed over look in his eyes. I wonder what he was thinking about. I quickly grabbed my cup and took a sip. Boys are so weird. I turned back to Hannah and Trevor, trying to pay attention. \"My brother was no Vernian.\" Trevor. Hannah grabbed his book and looked through it for a second, flicking through the pages, then got up and walked to her bookshelf. She grabbed a huge book off the shelf and brought it back over to us, dropping it on the table so hard that I thought it would break the table. \"This was my fathers copy. Take a look. The notes are exactly the same. Your brother was a Vernian.\" Hannah said, pointing at the books. We all leaned over and, true enough, both of the books had exactly the same scribbly notes. \"Wow my dad was kind of…out there.\" Sean mumbled. \"You didn't know him Sean.\" Trevor defended, frowning at the books. \"I'm beginning to think you didn't either.\" I commented. Trevor glared at me but I just stared back. I'm not about to be intimidated by a middle aged man who is competing for the attention of a woman he just met with his sixteen year old nephew. \"He was no member of a secret society.\" he pushed, keeping his glare on me. I noticed Sean's eyes flicker between me and his uncle before he shifted closer to me. Is he taking my side? \"What are you guys doing here?\" Hannah sighed, looking tired. \"I'm a scientist. I'm a professor. I'm here because there are seismic sensors going off thirty clicks north from here that we think we should check out.\" Trevor explained. Hannah raised an eyebrow at me and Sean. \"They are children.\" she said, blatantly meaning us. \"Hey, we're both sixteen thank you very much.\" I said firmly and Sean nodded. Hannah shrugged. \"Whatever, I'm the mountain guide. I can take you up there.\" she offered. Both Trevor and Sean's faces lit up. \"Great!\" Trevor said. \"Yeah I love hiking.\" Sean commented. Suck up, he didn't even like using the stairs in our apartment complex. All eyes landed on me. \"Great.\" I sighed. Sean smiled, leaning back on the couch. \"So it will be 5000 kronor to go up there.\" Hannah said as she replaced the book on the shelf. \"Five grand a day? No problem.\" Trevor said happily. \"An hour.\" Hannah corrected and his smile dropped. I smirked at him, she doesn't seem so great now does she? \"Do you except rolls of quarters?\" Sean asked. I didn't know if it was the exhaustion or the fact that I was tired of the boys focusing all their attention on Hannah, but I burst out laughing. Sean gave me a funny look, while Trevor just raised an eyebrow. I noticed Hannah glance at him worriedly but he just shook his head, telling her I was fine. \"Ellie, are you ok? It wasn't even that funny.\" Sean said as tears started to stream down my cheeks. I just nodded. \"I'm fine. It's just one of those things where you can't stop no matter how bad it was.\" I gasped between my giggles. I felt a hand on my back and looked up to see Sean rubbing it gently. Did he think I was having an attack? Idiot. \"Maybe you should get some sleep.\" Hannah commented. We all nodded, my giggling dying down to snickers. \"Alright. I will sleep down here. Sean and Ellie can take my room and Trevor, you can have my fathers old room.\" Hannah instructed. Trevor looked a little uncomfortable with the idea but nodded. I felt a little bad at taking Hannah's bed but she seemed set on the idea. Sean tapped me on the shoulder and I nodded, standing up and following him upstairs. \"Thank you Hannah.\" I shouted from the stairs. \"It's alright!\" she shouted back. When we reached the room, backs on our shoulders, I suddenly felt a bit awkward. I was about to share a room, alone, with a suddenly very friendly Sean. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit creped out. Sean opened the door and we both stood frozen in the doorway. It was a simple room, not very big but big enough to have enough room to walked around the large double bed that sat in the middle of the room against the wall. Sean looked at me, looking slightly worried. Knowing that he wanted confirmation, I walked towards the bed and took all the pillows off the bed and made a pillow wall down the middle. \"There. Now there will be no awkwardness.\" I said simply before taking my bag and walking out the room and towards the bathroom we had passed. I quickly changed into my pyjama's, a pair of short red chequered pyjama shorts and a white vest, then brushed my teeth and washed my face. When I returned to the room Sean was wearing a pair of grey sweat pants and an old ACDC shirt. He still looked a little awkward but I couldn't care less about the sleeping arrangements. I don't know what got into his mind to make him act so awkwardly but it was really starting to annoy me. I slipped into the bed on the side closest to the door and snuggled into the warm blankets. I heard a sigh before the bed on the other side of the pillow wall shifted as he got in. I turned off the light by my bedside table and let my eyes slide shut. \"Ellie?\" I heard Sean ask. I sighed. \"Yeah?\" I grumbled. I heard a rustling before Sean's head appeared over the pillow wall. \"Are we ok? I mean we're going to be moving to a whole new place and all we'll have is each other. I think maybe we should try getting along from now on. I know we've had our fights in the past but I'm willing to make an effort.\" he explained, looking straight at me. I felt my heart rate pick up at his words. He was willing to make an effort just to be my friend? I blushed slightly. But smiled at him. I wasn't going to lie, I was loving the attention I was getting from Sean since this trip started. At first it was kind of annoying, but now that I've seen how sweet he can be (Still weird, but sweet) I've really grown to appreciate him and miss the years I could have spent being his friend. I leaned up to become eye level with him and kissed his cheek. He blushed heavily in the darkness, but smiled sheepishly. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" he smirked. I just rolled my eyes but gave him a genuine smile. \"Goodnight Sean.\" I said, lying back down and rolling over. \"Goodnight Ellie.\" he mumbled, the smile still obviously on his face by his light tone. I smirked into my pillow. \"I hate you guys. Hiking sucks!\" I moaned as I trudged a few steps behind Hannah. We were still climbing the mountain, having started at pretty much the crack of dawn and it was coming up to . I was wearing a pair of black jean shorts and a red tank top. Even though I was tired, I was still ahead of Trevor and Sean. I had to keep looking back every now and then to make sure they were ok. \"Wow they're slow.\" I said to Hannah. She smiled before stopping to turn to them. \"Come on boys! I want to be home by sundown!\" she shouted down to them. \"Can you slow down a bit please?\" Trevor gasped but Hannah just kept going until she reached the top. I sighed as Trevor and Sean collapsed onto some rocks, climbing down to meet them. \"You guys need to get into shape.\" I said as I joined them. Sean and Trevor ignored me, both staring at Hannah's butt. \"Dibs.\" Sean said bluntly. Me and Trevor both looked at him confusedly. \"What?\" Trevor asked. \"I got dibs on the mountain guide.\" he clarified. My jaw clenched and I glared at the back of his head as he started to climb again. \"You're sixteen.\" Trevor said, climbing next to him. I followed on behind. \"Sorry called it.\" he said smugly. I growled and shoved him forwards, taking his place besides Trevor. \"Ow hey! What's your problem!\" he yelled at me. I just glared at him. \"Whatever. Get over it Trevor.\" he said before climbing on ahead of us. I just lowered my head and pushed on. I felt a tap on my shoulder and looked up at Trevor. \"You ok Ellie?\" he asked. \"I'm fine! Why'd you ask!\" I snapped at him. He smirked at me. \"Are you jealous of Hannah?\" he asked. I narrowed my eyes at him and stamped on his foot. \"Yeowch!\" he cried, clutching his foot. \"I was just asking.\" he whimpered. I shook my head at him. \"Don't go there.\" I warned. He gave me a sympathetic look. \"You've known him a long time Ellie. And he cares for you. If you do find yourself finally feeling something for him, tell him.\" I only shook my head at him, finding the idea of liking Sean as more then a friend laughable. \"What the heck is that?\" I asked, looking down at a small cylinder like thing with a spike on the end. \"It's like a black box that has recorded all seismic activity that's transpired over the last ten years. It could tell me a lot about Max and what he was doing around the time he went missing.\" Trevor explained as he began tugging on it. I heard thunder and stiffened. I didn't like thunder, it meant a storm was coming. \"Trevor I'm really sorry but we have to go now.\" Hannah said, looking worriedly at the sky. \"Must be corroded.\" Trevor mumbled, ignoring her completely. \"Trevor we need to take cov-\" we all jumped, except for Trevor, as a bolt of lightening struck near us. \"Alright we need to move now. Sean, Ellie come with me now.\" Hannah said, puling us by our arms over to a cave. \"I'll be right there.\" Trevor called. \"Trevor just leave it for now!\" Hannah shouted. \"I've almost got it!\" he shouted. I looked back up at the sky, noting that the sky was rapidly getting darker before running back over to help Trevor. \"Ellie come back! It's to dangerous!\" I heard Sean shout behind me but I ignored him. He didn't care anyway, he probably just wanted to look good in front of Hannah. When I reached Trevor I grabbed at the cylinder thing and helped pull. \"Get in the cave!\" Hannah shouted at us. \"Yes!\" Trevor shouted as he pulled the sensor thing free, only to jump harshly when a bolt of lightening struck right by where we were standing. \"Run!\" I shouted, pulling him along towards the cave. \"Trevor, the sensor is attracting the lightening! Drop it!\" Hannah shouted. \"Come on Ellie!\" Sean shouted, gesturing me to run faster. At that moment I just wanted to flip him off. \"I'm not goanna drop it!\" Trevor shouted, dodging another piece of lightening as he passed me. \"It's attracting the lightening!\" me, Sean and Hannah all shouted at the same time. Trevor screamed one more time before chucking the sensor behind him...at me. Just as it was about too hit me on the head, a bolt of lightening struck the sensor, shattering it into a million pieces. One piece struck my arm and I grit my teeth against the pain and burning heat of the metal shard. Trevor was already in the cave, panting heavily. \"Run Ellie! Come on!\" Sean shouted pleadingly while Hannah tended to Trevor. Just as I reached the mouth of the cave a bolt of lightening struck the rock wall above me. \"Jump Ellie!\" Sean yelled and I did, leaping right into his arms as a barrage of rocks drowned out any of our screaming. I felt one hit my head and my vision blurred. I felt myself slowly slipping out of consciousness, Sean's arms still wrapped around my waist. \"Ellie! Ellie wake up! Wake…up…!\" eventually his voice just faded away as my vision turned black. There it is. I hope you like it! Review![Chapter 6] Hey, Sorry it took so long. I've been really swamped. Enjoy! Sean's POV Oh my god. Oh my god. Ellie's been knocked unconscious and we're trapped in a cave. I was currently holding her close to me as we squatted in the cave, keeping her head protected from any more falling rocks. \"Sean? Sean are you alright?\" I heard Trevor ask as Hannah helped him up. I ground my teeth as I glared at him. \"Yes, I'm fine. I'd say Ellie is ok to but she's UNCONSCIOUS!\" I shouted at him. \"Sean I-\" Trevor started but I wouldn't hear it. \"No Trevor! It's not ok! Ellie's hurt and it's your fault because you couldn't let that sensor go!\" Trevor looked like he was going to say something but a glare from Hannah and me shut him up. \"Can you guys keep it down…I have a killer head ache.\" a voice mumbled from my arms and I jumped. I looked down to see Ellie with her eyes open and a hand on her head over a small cut I had bandaged with the supplies Hannah had brought. \"Oh thank god you're ok.\" I breathed, pulling her into a hug. \"Why do you care?\" she grumbled, pushing herself from my arms and sitting up. I felt a little hurt, but remembered that she was pissed at me for some reason. So much for getting along. \"Because I didn't want to have to be the one to explain to our parents why you mysteriously died while we were in Iceland.\" I snapped back at her, leaving her to fix herself. I felt bad, leaving her alone but she was being bitchy again. \"Ok everyone just remain calm.\" Hannah said soothingly. Calm? How can we be calm at a time like this? \"Guys come on, you gotta help me dig.\" I cried frantically, attempting to lift one of the boulders. I heard a snickering from behind me and knew it was Ellie. \"Like you could lift one of those.\" she mocked. That only resulted in me trying harder to lift the boulder, determined to prove her wrong. (and maybe impress her) \"She said stay calm, not freak out.\" Ellie laughed. \"You could at least help.\" I growled. \"We're trapped Sean. It would take months for us to dig our way out. No use wasting energy I might need later on by doing something completely pointless.\" Ellie responded stretching out on one of the larger rocks. \"Forget it. She's right, it's no use.\" Hannah said. \"Forget it?\" I yelled, turning back to face them. \"Ellie's right. There must be about 60 or 70 tons of boulders on the top of us. It would take about a month to dig out of here. We have to find another way.\" Trevor said pointing his flashlight in every direction. \"What if there is no other way?\" I asked, feeling myself start to panic. \"There's always another way, Sean.\" Hannah said from across the cave. I looked around at the walls, searching for a way out. \"What else have you got?\" Trevor asked watching Hannah take a few things out of her pack. \"Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets, and a couple of protein bars. But they're on ration. We don't know how long we'll be trapped for.\" Hannah said handing us head lights and flashlights. \"Why did you say that?\" Ellie groaned. \"Trapped? Is that what we are?\" I asked looking from Trevor to Hannah. \"She- No, she didn't mean that. Sean, hey, what are you doing?\" Trevor asked watching me wave around my cell-phone. \"God, I'm not getting any service.\" I exclaimed. \"Sean, you're not goanna get any signal down here, Okay? Put this away. Okay, don't worry about it. We'll find another way out, all right?\" Trevor explained. \"Why are you so calm, Ellie?\" I asked giving up with my phone and looking at her. Ellie sighed irritably and stood up, coming to stand in front of me before slapping me harshly on the cheek. \"Because unlike you I have a pair!\" she said with humour but I knew it was also meant to be demeaning. I glared at her. \"We are going to get out of here, right? Right?\" I asked Hannah, turning to her while cupping my cheek. Wow that girl can hit hard. \"Yes Sean we are going to get out of here.\" Hannah said. I sighed with relief, taking a flashlight that she handed to me. Trevor looked with his flashlight at the two other tunnels that were in the cave. \"One of these might snake back to the surface.\" Trevor said with enthusiasm. \"How do we know which one to take?\" I asked, looking up at Trevor. \"My gut says we go right.\" Trevor said walking towards the right tunnel. Ellie and I looked at each other nervously and I motioned for her to go first. She glared at me and trudged on after Trevor, me following and Hannah bringing up the rear. We walked through the tunnel, rocks surrounding us on all sides. I could feel myself freaking out with every step I take, wishing I was back home, Canada, stuck in a closet with Ellie for an hour anything was better then this! \"Ah this looks promising.\" Trevor said as he led us through the cave. \"Forgive me for being sceptical but, considering all that's happened to me since this began, I will remain doubtful until we're outside.\" Ellie grumbled from in front of me. I smirked in amusement. \"Just keep walking. We'll be out of here in no time.\" Trevor shot back, trying to sound enthusiastic. \"Direction is my sixth sense. I used to do field work. I used to love doing field work…\" Trevor gushed on but we were all ignoring him. \"Watch out!\" Hannah gasped, pushing past me and shoving Ellie backwards to grab Trevor's jacket and pull him back from falling over a sheer drop. They were both panting. \"You're not studying rocks in a lab professor, this is life or death here.\" she warned. Trevor nodded and she smirked, punching his shoulder lightly. \"You owe me one.\" she chuckled. Me and Ellie were both breathing heavily, watching the scene unfold in front of us. Ellie was leaning against my chest, her eyes wide. \"Are you alright?\" I whispered gently in her ear. She shivered against me before pulling herself away. \"I'm fine!\" she snapped, taking a few steps forwards before tripping on something laying on the ground. I quickly reached forwards and grabbed her backpack, pulling her against me again. \"Obviously.\" I scoffed, smirking at her. She glared at me before elbowing me in the stomach, stepping out of my arms and picking whatever she had tripped on up while I gasped for breath. Like I said, she can hit hard. When I caught my breath I looked over her shoulder to look at the sign. \"Arkon gabrenna.\" I said with some trouble. \"That means keep out.\" Hannah translated. \"Maybe that's some decent advice.\" I mumbled, looking down into the chasm that Trevor had nearly fallen into. \"Wimp.\" I heard Ellie scoff behind me. I ground my teeth together to stop the insults from flying out my mouth. Seriously, what was her problem all of a sudden? I knew she was a bit of a hot head before, but now she's just being a bit of stubborn bitch. \"No, no. This could be great news. This could lead us to an old mine shaft which could be our way out,\" Hannah replied, taking her jacket off. Ellie mimicked her, now in just her tank top, jean shorts and hiking boots. She left little to the imagination but I refused to have anymore weird and unwanted fantasies about her until she told me what was wrong. \"How far down do you think it is?\" I asked. Trevor seemed to be thinking as he stared down the chasm. \"Hannah, give me one of those flares,\" Trevor said. Hannah unzipped her bag and passed him a flare. I stared at it, wondering what he was going to do with it. \"Ok Sean, look at your watch.\" I did as I was told. \"I'm going to drop this flare and you're going to count the seconds until it stops. Ok?\" he asked. I nodded, feeling a little pressured. Ellie was still in front of me, staring at the roof of the cave with a troubled look on her face. Trevor lit his flare and held it above his head. \"Uh Trevor…\" Ellie said warningly, tugging at his arm. He shoved her hand away. \"Three, two, one-\" BANG! The wall above us exploded and we were all thrown backwards, Hannah into Trevor, me backwards and Ellie right back into my arms. I blushed deeply as she struggled against me, fighting to stand back up. \"Here let me help.\" I mumbled sheepishly, trying to help. She shied away so much she looked like she'd rather jump down the chasm then accept my help. \"What was that?\" Hannah asked, gasping as she sat up. Trevor, who was stood back up, ran his hand along the wall. \"It looks like Ma-\" \"Magnesium! I tried to warn you, but no! next time listen to me.\" Ellie snapped, jabbing him in the stomach with her fingers. Trevor looked a little sheepish, a small blush on his face. That's my Ellie, always determined to make herself heard even long after the topic is passed. \"Magnesium is kind of flammable, isn't it professor?\" Hannah asked, a smug smile on her face. She was so smart, for a blonde, but Ellie was smarter. She was the one who spotted the Magnesium before Trevor. \"Well done!\" Ellie snapped back sarcastically. That was a little harsh, even for Ellie. Hannah looked a little shocked and hurt at that comment but hid it with a concentrated frown as she dug through her backpack. \"How about this?\" she suggested, holding up a snapped glow-stick. Trevor nodded and took it from her. I looked back at my watch but not before noticing the glare that Ellie shot at Trevor while refusing to look at Hannah. She needed a talking to about her attitude. Trevor dropped the glow-stick and I started counting. \"One, Two…almost three.\" I concluded. \"Which is about…two hundred feat.\" he concluded, how I have no idea. \"That's your basic twenty story high rise. You got enough rope?\" he asked, looking back at Hannah. \"I always have enough rope,\" She snorted. She unzipped the bag and handed it to him. I didn't like where this was going. \"Enough rope for what?\" I asked anxiously. \"For going down there,\" Ellie said plainly. \"We're goanna be going down that deep dark hole?\" Sean asked in disbelief. \"Yeah, so don't go wimping out like usual.\" Ellie grunted, taking the rope that Hannah begrudgingly offered her. I sneered at her. \"Alright, what the hell is-\" I didn't get to finish, Trevor clapping a hand over my mouth as he strapped a harness around my waist. \"Don't make her madder then she already is.\" he warned. I nodded. Soon we were all strapped in and Trevor was almost halfway down. Ellie and I glanced at each other, me not wanting to propel down a dark, twenty story deep hole. \"Come on then.\" Ellie grumbled. I glared after her, copying her actions as we were slowly lowered over the edge of the chasm. We walked down the wall, me barely keeping myself from freaking out. \"Just keep walking Sean.\" Ellie said, keeping her eyes on the wall. \"Yeah, looking good Sean. You sure you haven't dome this before?\" Trevor mocked as he scaled easily down the wall. \"Shut up!\" I snapped through gritted teeth, trying to focus on the wall while trying not to look like an idiot in front of Ellie…and Hannah. My feet scrabbled against the wall, some rocks coming off and hitting Trevor on the head. \"Hey watch it!\" he snapped. Ha-ha. \"I'm hanging on for the edge of my life here.\" I defended. I don't know why he was giving me such a hard time, this was my first time doing something like this. Ellie scaled down beside me, looking very irritated. \"Just focus on me Sean.\" she tried to say calmly. I nodded unsurely, my mind suddenly going blank. \"So E-Ellie, come here often?\" I asked lamely. I was answered with a confused look from Ellie, who looked like she was fighting back a really harsh comment. \"Is that the best you can come up with? You've practically been her boyfriend for ten years and that's all you can think to start a conversation with?\" Trevor laughed and my cheeks darkened. \"Shut up! I'm doing what she told me!\" I yelled down at him. Instead of tearing me a new one like I expected, Ellie sucked in a deep breath before saying in a tight voice. \"No, Sean. I don't come here often.\" I smiled at the easy going answer and Ellie managed to crack a grin into the darkness. That was much better then her frown. Slowly, we all climbed further down, me and Ellie keeping our conversation going. \"Hey look at all this schist.\" Trevor commented, interrupting Ellie as she was talking about her summer last year. \"What?\" I choked, Ellie also looking a little shocked. \"Metamorphic rock. Green schist, carnage schist,\" Trevor named the rocks. \"Oh. Schist,\" I said, glad it wasn't what I had first heard. Ellie smiled to herself, letting out a little giggle. \"It's everywhere-look at it! It's-\" Suddenly Trevor slipped and fell, jerking us off the wall and causing us to hang there. Ellie gripped onto me as we all screamed and searched for something to hold onto. I was currently trying to get me and Ellie back to the wall. \"Don't let go of me Ellie, ok?\" I ordered, wrapping one arm around her waist and reaching for the wall with the other. I felt Ellie nod against my chest as she held onto me tightly. \"Trevor your rope is caught on mine. If we're going to get down I'm going to have to cut you loose,\" Hannah said. I heard shuffling and guessed she was reaching for a knife. \"WHAT? NO!\" Trevor screamed as he fell about five centimetres. Ellie and I laughed as we slowly propelled back to the ground, my arm still wound protectively around her waist. My eyes flickered to my arm and noticed that she was holding onto it, keeping it there. I smiled, in relief and at the heart warming feeling as our feet touched the ground. \"Hey Hannah you knew the bottom was down here, right?\" Trevor asked. Hannah didn't answer. \"Hannah?\" When she still said nothing, Ellie smiled at him patronizingly, stepping out of my embrace to stand over him and say snidely. \"Of course.\" Hope it was worth the wait and will work on getting the next one out sooner. Review![Chapter 7] Like I keep saying, I'm sorry my updates are taking so long but I am currently starting two new fics so everything might take a few days at a time at the minimum but they should be worth it. Enjoy! And I love your Reviews. Ellie's POV As we all got to the bottom of the chasm, Sean was walking around shinning his torch on everything. I'm glad he hasn't asked me about my attitude problem, considering I don't really have a very good answer. I'll admit, ever since Sean started focusing most of his attention on Hannah, I've been missing him a lot more then I thought I would. I wish I knew why I was so suddenly craving his attention but I didn't and maybe it's like Trevor's been saying…maybe I like him. I shuddered at the thought, feeling an odd sensation in my stomach. \"Hey, are you ok?\" I heard Sean's voice ask. At first I thought he was asking Hannah but when I felt a tap on my shoulder I turned to see a pair of concerned coffee brown eyes staring at me. \"Ellie, are you alright? You shivered.\" he asked again. I blushed in the darkness, realising he must have been watching me. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" I lied. He nodded but as he looked down his eyes widened and he grabbed my arm. \"What the heck happened to your arm?\" he asked, holding it gently. I looked down and saw the deep cut with some shiny stuff in there. I shrugged at him. \"It's fine Sean. I just got hit by some of the metal when the sensor exploded. I'll be fine.\" I assured him. He looked a little unsure but went back to his inspecting. \"Hey guys, what's this?\" He asked. His torch was shining on a dusty door looking thing. \"It's the mine. It was shut down sixty years ago because of the big disaster,\" Hannah said, pointing at it with her torch as well. I made my way over to them, coming to stand next to Sean. He shifted a little, looking uncomfortable and I realised I was standing a lot closer then I needed to. \"Disaster? How big?\" he asked. \"Eighty-one dead,\" Hannah answered, looking grim. \"That's pretty big,\" Trevor noted and I gave him a 'oh really' look. Hannah led the way, Trevor following her and Sean and me next to each other. Sean still looked a little freaked out by our situation. He was as pale as a piece of paper and shaking slightly. I tried not to focus on him, feeling my heart go out to the poor guy. It was only when I felt a clammy, shaky hand grip mine tightly did I realise that he must be really scared. I snuck a glance to see that he was looking down, his eyes un-see able. \"Hey, we're goanna be ok, alright?\" I asked gently. He lifted his head and smiled at me appreciatively. \"There's my Sean.\" I chuckled. He raised an eyebrow. \"Your Sean? Why miss Ellie do you want me as your own?\" he teased. I blushed heavily. \"Hey, Trevor was there a mine like this in the book?\" I asked, dodging the question. \"No,\" His uncle replied. \"I don't think so.\" After a while he asked Hannah \"Hey, do you wonder if your father and my brother had been right?\" Sean and me looked over at Hannah to see her glaring at Trevor. Oh no, this didn't look good. \"Let me get something straight to you.\" she said, rather coldly. \"I am not my father. And the world he belonged to has nothing to do with me.\" she was speaking as if Trevor was stupid. I felt a cold feeling go through me as Hannah turned, catching me staring at her and sending me a glare. I gulped but Sean gripped my hand tighter, reassuring me. He's taking me over Hannah? I grinned to myself. Trevor on the other hand was stuttering madly. \"O-of c-c-course, I d-didn't mean-\" he tried. \"You know I'm still charging you right?\" Hannah asked quickly, facing him again. Trevor's jaw dropped. \"You're still billing me?\" he asked in disbelief. \"I bill you until I am safe in my house.\" she smirked. I rolled my eyes, tugging Sean along with me as I walked past the arguing grown-ups. As we walked I spotted a giant machine with loads of different cogs and wheels attached to it. I walked over to it and started pulling on some of the leavers. \"Hey what's that? What are you doing?\" Sean asked nervously. \"It's an old generator.\" Hannah said, joining me and pulling on some leavers. \"I don't think you want to do that.\" Trevor warned, coming a little closer. \"I think I do.\" Hannah answered back, flicking a final switch before the lights all came on. My eyes widened at the site of all the tunnels that twisted through the mountain. 81 people died in this mine and I hoped it wouldn't move up to 85. \"Ok I take it back.\" Trevor laughed. I grinned at him before looking back around. My eyes widened as I spotted some mine carts sitting on a track. I nudged Sean and pointed at them. His eyes lit up at the sight of them. \"Hey this could be our way out.\" he cried excitedly, running towards them. \"The miners had to put their stuff somewhere, the tracks could take us out.\" \"How many miners got out?\" I asked Hannah, hesitantly following Sean. \"…Uh one.\" Hannah said sheepishly. I stopped and turned to stare at her. \"What?\" I cried. \"Good enough for me. I call front.\" Sean yelled, rushing to the front cart. My head snapped up. \"No way! I call shotgun!\" I shouted, rushing over and hopping into the cart before he could. Sean narrowed his eyes at me before jumping in behind me. \"I'm ok with sharing with you…if you tell me why you're acting so cold to everyone.\" he said firmly. Before I could struggle to find an answer Hannah pushed us off on her pump cart thingy. I lurched forwards, Sean having to grip my waist as we sped off to stop me from falling over the front. \"This isn't over.\" he growled against my ear. Soon we were going fast, so fast that my hair was whipping behind me and into Sean's face. I whimpered as we got even faster, gripping onto Sean tightly and burying my face in his chest. \"Sean does it look safe?\" Trevor asked from behind us. \"I think I see something.\" he shouted back, his heartbeat suddenly starting to pound in my ears. I snuck a look behind us and immediately regretted it, spotting the gaping drop that was coming up. \"Oh we're in deep schist.\" Sean mumbled, wrapping a protective arm around me. We all screamed as we plummeted downwards. This was worse then any rollercoaster I had ever been on. \"How come they don't have seatbelts on this thing?\" Sean shouted. I lifted my head and stared right at him in disbelief. \"You're worried about seatbelts?\" I screamed at him. He looked like he was going to answer but his eyes suddenly widened. I turned to see what he was looking at and felt a sick feeling drop into my stomach at the sight of the gap in the tracks. \"Uh Hannah.\" Sean muttered worriedly. \"I know!\" she shouted back. \"Pull the break!\" Trevor shouted and I was about to when Hannah shouted at me. \"No! We won't make it!\" she shouted and I felt us start to speed up. We were goanna die, I knew we were goanna die on this stupid search for the centre of the earth. I turned back around to face Sean, who was staring at me with a sorry expression. \"I'm sorry we dragged you into this! I never wanted you to get hurt!\" he shouted over the all the noise. I didn't answer, just staring at him. I knew I wanted to do this before I died so I sucked in a deep breath, grabbed him by the front of his shirt and smashed my lips to his. Sean stiffened completely as I kissed him then seemed to relax as he wrapped his arms tightly around my waist and deepening it. I could feel the cart launch from the tracks as Sean and I kissed. A calm, yet exhilarating sensation coursed through my veins at his kiss. It was dangerous, yet safe. Infuriating, yet peaceful. He was Sean and that was the best way I could describe how amazing this feeling was. Sean was thrown away from me as the cart landed back onto the tracks. I was about to see if he was ok but I stopped when I saw Trevor and Hannah fly off onto another track. \"Hang on you guys!\" Trevor shouted as he and Hannah disappeared down another tunnel. I crawled down next to Sean, who was having some trouble standing back up. \"Just stay down! We'll get back up when this thing stops!\" I yelled. He nodded, wrapping his arms around my waist and pulling me under him. I gave him a confused look but he just stared down at me. \"Tell me why you've been acting so weird today!\" he demanded, completely trapping me under him. I tried to shrink away from his fierce gaze but I knew he was determined to get his answer. \"I was jealous of the attention you and Trevor were giving Hannah. We'd only just become friends and I wanted to know you more!\" I answered truthfully, seeing as the possibility that we could die was rapidly growing. Sean's eyes softened and he lowered himself onto my body, curling me under him. I think he was attempting to hug me, his face buried in my neck. I hugged back and we just lay there, Sean shielding me from any harm. Soon our cart rolled to a slow stop and I could hear groaning beside us. Sean quickly sat up, looking a little awkward. \"That. Was. Awesome!\" Sean yelled as he hopped out of the cart and I couldn't help but smile a little. Yes, yes it was. \"What happened to you guys?\" he asked. I looked down to see Trevor and Hannah laying on the ground, Hannah on top of Trevor. \"Don't ask.\" Trevor growled, his voice strained. I was still a little dizzy from the cart ride…and what had happened during it. \"Need some help?\" Sean asked, holding out his hand. I blushed as he helped me out the cart, plopping me down next to me. \"Thanks.\" I mumbled sheepishly. \"Look Sean…about what happened in the…\" I trailed off as I noticed that Sean wasn't even looking at me, looking over at where the tracks ended. \"Hey, what's that?\" he asked, walking towards it. I sighed as I followed. \"Hey don't go in there.\" Trevor warned, having a hard time getting back up. We ignored him and heard him groan as he and Hannah followed us through the hole the mine cart had made in the wall. I felt my breath catch at the many gems that were imbedded in the wall. It was amazing there were so many colours. Red, green, pale blue, dark blue. I didn't know gems could be this colour. \"Hey guys look, Rubies.\" Sean murmured, touching one gently. \"Emeralds.\" I said, looking at a small cluster of them. \"Diamonds.\" Hannah breathed. \"Feldspar.\" Trevor said bluntly. Feldspar? What the heck was that? \"Crystals are most commonly formed and found in…volcanic tubes.\" he said, looking up. \"This tune could take us back up right?\" Hannah asked. \"Yeah.\" Trevor mumbled, going back to the diamonds. \"When I get out of here, I'm getting a Mazzarati.\" Sean said, shoving a handful of different coloured gems into a small pouch in his bag. \"You know Sean money doesn't always matter. People matter to.\" Trevor said as he drooled over the gems. \"Not when you have a Mazzarati.\" Sean answered back. That one hurt a little, realising Sean cared more for a car then he did me. I moved away from him, a particular gem catching my eye. It was completely smooth and in the shape of a 3D kite, unlike the rough texture of all the other crystals. It was a deep green colour with a lighter centre, like there was life in the centre of the crystal. \"It matches your eyes.\" I heard Sean say from right behind me, his breath on my neck. I smiled to myself, feeling the regular warmth in my stomach whenever Sean was nice to me. Carefully I plucked the emerald from the wall, noting the small hole that went right through at the top. Bending down, I undid one of my shoelaces and threaded it through the emerald before tying it around my neck, letting the crystal rest against my chest. Just as I was standing up I heard a cracking sound under me before noticing a crack forming around my feet. \"Did you guys hear that?\" Sean asked hesitantly. I nodded, completely frozen. \"Nobody move,\" Trevor said immediately. I did as I was told and Sean copied me, crouching slightly to spread his weight. Hannah knelt to the ground very slowly. \"Tell me that's not what I think it is,\" She said. \"Muscovite,\" Trevor squeaked. \"Oh,\" Hannah gasped. What the heck is Muscovite? \"What's Muscovite?\" Sean asked. Thank you. \"Muscovite is a very thin type of rock formation,\" Hannah explained in a cautious voice. \"How thin?\" Sean asked nervously. I had a feeling I wasn't going to like the answer. \"So thin that the slightest change of weight or pressure can cause it to shatter,\" Trevor said in a wobbly voice. \"And we're standing on a lot of it.\" I gulped loudly, really wishing that I was back in my bed. Sean didn't look to happy either. He took a slow and balanced step. The cracking noises continued. \"Stop,\" I told him. He did as I said and kept still. \"What should we do?\" I asked Trevor. \"Um…ok you two take very slow steps towards us.\" he instructed. We nodded and started, me cringing every time there was a cracking noise. As we came to the middle, Sean put his arm out in front of me. \"Let me go first, just in case.\" he whispered to me, his eyes full of care. He would risk his own life for mine? Why would he do that? I noticed that Sean had left his backpack back by the wall. Knowing he would want that Mazzarati I leaned over and slowly picked it up and handed it to him. He smiled appreciatively, and slung it over his shoulder. My eyes widened as one of the diamonds he had grabbed slipped out, rocketing towards the very fragile ground. \"No!\" Sean cried, reaching for the rock. I cringed as it hit the ground, slicing through it and getting stuck halfway. We all paused, nothing making a sound apart from some cracking. After a minute we let out a breath. \"It's actually tougher then I thought.\" Trevor laughed, looking smug. I glared at Sean. \"You and you're bloody Mazzarati! You could of got us all killed!\" I yelled at him. Sean glared back. \"You weren't exactly trying to stop me!\" he yelled back. \"I thought you were finally being responsible!\" I shouted back. \"You're not good for anything. No in fact the only thing you are good for is being irritating but don't worry your mouth makes up for it!\" Sean suddenly looked smug. \"You weren't complaining in the mine cart.\" he said, an unbearable smirk on his face. My face went bright red. \"If I had know we weren't going to die I never would have wasted such an important first experience on such a whiny, arrogant, self-centred dick head who's own father left him to go study rocks!\" I shouted. Sean's face went completely white but his eyes held a fury I had never seen. Trevor and Hannah were looking appalled at me, both thinking the same thing. What a complete bitch. \"Sean I…I'm so sor-\" I tried but was cut off by the floor completely giving out under us, sending us all plummeting down. We all screamed at the top of our lungs as we were plunged into darkness. After a few minutes we all stopped, realising we hadn't hit anything yet. \"We're still falling!\" Trevor shouted and we all started screaming again. \"Trevor what's at the bottom?\" Hannah shouted over the rushing of the wind. \"If Verne was right, this tunnel should go on for hundreds of miles!\" he answered and Hannah glowered at him as best she could. \"Verne was not right!\" she snapped at him. \"Trevor finish! What's at the bottom!\" I insisted. \"Well it most likely just ends!\" he answered. I didn't like that answer. I glanced over at Sean, not wanting to die before I could apologise to him. I know that what I said was definitely out of line and not even true. I will never regret having my first kiss with Sean and I'm sure his dad loved him. Looking over at Sean, he didn't look very happy with Trevor's answer. \"Ends? Got any other theories?\" he asked. \"Well the walls of the tunnel could have eroded with water which is still running, providing a gradual break to our fall, kind of like a waterslide!\" he said. That sounded much better. \"That's better!\" I shouted. I was answered with a glare from Sean. \"No shit!\" he snapped. I felt awful, I must have really hurt his feelings. \"But Trevor the leverage of the water is pointing straight up at us! We'll be skewered!\" Hannah said. I really wish she hadn't said that. \"That is also possible!\" Trevor noted and we all started screaming again. After half an hour I felt something hit my face. It was a droplet of water touch my face and by his startled cry, I think Sean felt it to. \"Is that water?\" Hannah asked. I gave her a 'duh' look but Trevor answered for her anyway. \"Waterslide. Waterslide.\" Sean chanted, his hands clasped in the pray position. Knowing this could be my only chance, I turned myself to face Sean. He didn't look to happy to see me. \"Sean, I shouldn't have said those things! I'm really so-\" I was effectively cut off by the water that we all dropped into. It was exactly like a waterslide, only it was the most terrifying ride of my life. It was worse then any plane ride that I had ever been on. We were sent tumbling down this tunnel of watery nightmares until we were ejected into a large underground cave of water. We were trapped under a rock roof with no way out. I knew it…we were goanna die. Suddenly Trevor pointed behind me and I turned to see a way out. We all started to swim towards it but me and Hannah were behind the boys. Hannah looked to be struggling with her backpack, it was the biggest. Knowing I needed to make up with Hannah, I swam behind her and undid her straps, taking her backpack and slinging it onto my shoulder. No wonder she was struggling to swim with this thing. I was already running out of breath and was way behind. My vision started to go blurry as Hannah swam ahead of me, sometimes looking back with a concerned expression on her face. Suddenly a shape emerged into my eyesight and Hannah was suddenly whisked away. I on the other hand was left to drown. I deserved it for what I said to Sean and how I had treated Hannah. I'm glad I managed to do something nice for her before I died. I just wish I had apologised to Sean. As my vision went black I saw a shape coming towards me. Hope you liked it and will love your Reviews! I will not update until I get up to at least three new reviews so... REVIEW![Chapter 8] Here it is. Sorry everything is taking so long. Enjoy. Sean's POV I burst out of the water, gasping for breath. Trevor tapped me on the shoulder and gestured towards a bank. We both swam over to it and collapsed onto our backs, panting. After a few moments I realised that neither Hannah or Ellie were with us. \"Hannah?\" Trevor cried. I noticed some bubbles coming to the surface and that was enough to make Trevor dive into the water. He emerged a few seconds later with Hannah, his arm wrapped securely around her waist. I wadded into the water to help pull her ashore. \"My backpack was…too heavy.\" she gasped. As I helped pull her out of the water I noticed she didn't have her backpack with her. \"Where's your pack?\" I asked as she lay down on the bank. \"Ellie took it. She saved my life.\" she gasped. Ellie? Where was Ellie? \"She still hasn't surfaced yet.\" Hannah cried. Trevor looked saddened but was busy fussing over Hannah. I glared at them before I rushed and dived into the water, swimming with all my energy into the water. I spotted a shape as it thrashed in the water, a large pack over its shoulder. I pushed on harder and soon came closer. It was Ellie! Her movements were slowing as she struggled in the water. I grabbed her arm and pulled her along. I was already running out of breath so I couldn't imagine what Ellie was feeling. As we came closer to the surface where Trevor and Hannah were waiting Ellie went limp in my arms. No! she couldn't die! I broke the surface and rushed over to Hannah and Trevor. I lay Ellie out on her back and looked over her. Her face was pale, her eyes shut and she wasn't breathing. \"Trevor what do we do?\" I cried. He looked worried. \"She needs CPR!\" he cried, coming towards her. Hell no was he going to touch her after leaving her to die like that. I moved to kneel beside Ellie and started to do chest compressions. When those failed to work I tilted her chin up and lowered my mouth to hers, giving her my breaths. I did this for a few minutes, determined not to let her die. A cough interrupted my actions and I pulled away as Ellie rolled over onto her side, coughing up water. I rubbed her back to sooth her as she panted. \"Sean?\" she asked as she got her breath back. I nodded at her, a smile taking over my face despite what she had said to me. I couldn't care less at that moment, Ellie was safe and that was all that mattered to me. \"Sean I'm so sorry about what I said I didn't mean any of it.\" she cried, tears running down her cheeks. That made me smile as I lay down next to her, wrapping my arms around her waist and pulling her into me. Trevor and Hannah lay down next to us and we all stared up at the roof of the cave we were in. it sparkled with a light blue light. \"Are those stars?\" Hannah questioned. The light was oddly florescent. \"No that's just the cave ceiling.\" Trevor answered, sounding a little unsure. \"Is it me or is the cave ceiling moving?\" Ellie asked, her eyes narrowed in concentration, moving to stand up. I was up in a second, gripping her arms to help her up. Trevor and Hannah also stood up to investigate. As we all looked up, the 'ceiling' shifted away from the roof and started to flutter all around us. \"They're…birds. Electric birds?\" Ellie asked, lifting her hand. I watched in amazement as a group of birds swooped around her hand. She laughed as the feathers tickled her skin. I smiled at her, loving to see her happy. Trevor started going about how these birds were from a billion years ago but I wasn't listening. One of the birds stayed close to Ellie and me, flying between us. It landed on Ellie's outstretched finger, tweeting happily. I reached over and ran my finger down its back. It pushed itself against my hand. Ellie was still smiling. \"This is so cool.\" she breathed. I nodded and my eyes landed on something resting against Ellie's chest. It was the emerald that I had said matched her eyes. I grabbed it and held it up. Ellie blushed, looking back at the bird. \"You kept this?\" I asked and she nodded. I smiled, pulling her into a hug. \"That, is cool.\" I whispered to her and she laughed. I pulled back and stared at her. The moment was interrupted by the bird, who had flown from Ellie's hand and into a small cave. \"Hey guys, a way out.\" Trevor said, walking past us. We all followed them, and what we came across was like nothing I expected to find. Plants were everywhere, being fed by a giant ball of light that looked similarly like a sun. A huge waterfall was thundering down from the sky, birds swooping and gliding around it. \"Ladies and gentlemen I give you the centre of the earth.\" Trevor said slowly. I think he was being a little dramatic but I was still shocked into silence. \"Max was right! He was right! MAX WAS RIGHT!\" Trevor shouted happily for the whole…inner world to hear. \"Hannah your dad was right to.\" Ellie said, giving her a big smile. Hannah didn't look to happy but only we seemed to notice, Trevor to busy gloating over his belief in Max. \"They believed in something that everyone told them was impossible. They were RIGHT!\" Trevor shrieked. \"ALRIGHT! We get it Trevor!\" Ellie yelled at him. I snickered at his sheepish expression. \"Now, what the heck is that light up there?\" she asked in a calmer voice. Trevor seemed to collect himself as he answered. \"I can't tell…but it looks like some kind of luminescent gas combination…?\" \"A terrarium.\" I answered. Ellie gave me a surprised look. Look who's the smart one now. I smirked at her. \"Didn't expect that huh?\" I said smugly. She just rolled her eyes. \"A terrarium right under the crust of the earth…a world within the world.\" Trevor said in a amazement. We started to walk again, exploring the magnificent world we had stumbled upon. Trevor was reading from his book and everything was almost exactly the same. \"It's exactly what Lyden Brock wrote.\" he laughed, closing the book. \"So you're saying Lyden Brock, the character, was real?\" Hannah questioned. \"Someone came down here. Someone saw all this. Someone got out and someone told Verne.\" he summarised, taking in everything around us. A way out? \"Someone got out? That's the best news I've heard all day.\" I said happily. \"Doesn't this just blow your mind?\" Trevor continued, ignoring me as he blew on a giant dandelion. The white spores floated away, surrounding Ellie, Hannah and I. Ellie laughed happily, reaching out and touching one of the spores. I smiled and pulled her closer to me, letting her lean against my chest. The spores swirled around us, like a mini white hurricane. We were enclosed together. \"My mind is blown, yes.\" Hannah chuckled. We began exploring again, passing by some huge mushrooms. Every now and then I would glance at Ellie. Even when she was covered in mud and was still drying off a little from our swim, she still looked beautiful. My mind started to wander back to what she had said in the mine cart, about how she was jealous of the attention I was giving Hannah. I hadn't realised I was giving Hannah any real attention. The only reason I placed dibs on Hannah in front of her was to rile her up but I didn't think she'd take it so seriously. And that kiss…it was amazing. I knew my dream had started to make me feel something for the hot tempered girl but now, after feeling her lips on mine, I knew I was completely in love with her. I know that's a bit of a jump from barely being able to tolerate her but…No one, not any girlfriend I had ever had before, can made me feel the way she dose. When she mocked me and brought my dad up, I never thought I could experience such heartache. I had promised myself to not forgive her…but when she nearly drowned that promise went out the window and all I could think about was saving her. \"Hey Sean, check this out.\" I heard Ellie say. I stopped, realising that I had moved away from her slightly. I caught back up with her to see her standing in front of a tall, twisted tree with a way in at the bottom. We looked at each other and I could tell what she was thinking. \"Sean? Ellie?\" we heard Hannah and Trevor call as they approached us. \"I'm going up.\" I said when Trevor was beside me. Ellie nodded but waited behind. \"Hey wait up.\" Trevor said in a cautious voice as he followed. Ellie and Hannah didn't follow us, beginning to talk. I hope Ellie was apologising to Hannah. Even though Ellie had saved her life, I could tell Hannah was still a little uneasy around her. When I reached the top of the tree I was amazed at what I saw. It looked like someone had made a home out of it. There was a table with food and notebooks on it, a hammock in the corner big enough for two. I picked up one of the not books. \"Trevor look, this must be one of Lyden Brock's note books.\" I said excitedly. Trevor took a look at the book before glancing down at his own. His face fell as he held up the book. \"Yeah…Sean. Those aren't Lyden Brock's notes.\" he mumbled, showing me the page from my dads book. The hand writing was exactly the same. I stared up at Trevor, a million questions racing through my mind. Before I could ask even one of them, a voice sounded from outside. \"Trevor! Could you come out here?\" Hannah shouted. I looked out the window to see Hannah and Ellie standing together. Ellie wasn't looking at us, choosing instead to gaze at the floor. Something didn't feel right as I looked up at Trevor. \"Could you wait here for a second?\" Trevor asked and I nodded. I watched him as he talked with Hannah. She must have said something bad because he was suddenly taking off into the forest with her close behind. I stared down at Ellie, who was watching him go. She turned around to look at me and I could see tears running down her cheeks. I ran from the tree house, scarping myself a few times as I scrambled down the trunks tunnel. When I reached her I forced her to look at me. \"Ellie what's going on?\" I demanded. \"Sean I'm so sorry.\" She sniffed. I gave her a confused look. She just gulped, taking me by the hand and leading me down the path that Trevor and Hannah took. Soon we where at a beach. Before us stood Trevor and Hannah, who were standing in front of a pile of rocks. \"Who is that?\" I demanded, my voice shaking. Ellie gave me a look. \"No.\" I pleaded but she nodded sadly. Trevor came up to me and put a hand on my shoulder and Hannah gave me a kiss on the head. I didn't want there comfort though, I just wanted Ellie. She must have read my thoughts because as soon as Hannah had pulled away she beside me, wrapping her arms around me in a tight hug. \"I never even got the chance to know him.\" I mumbled, my voice shaking. Ellie only hugged me tighter, stroking my hair gently. \"He wrote you something and I really want you to hear it.\" Trevor said gravely, pulling out a little journal that I think I saw him pick up in the tree house.. I nodded, staring at the ocean while fighting back tears. \"August fourteenth 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday.\" I looked up at him. \"Six weeks ago I promised myself I would be home to give him his first baseball glove. Now I'm worried I'll never get the chance. I set out to make an incredible discovery to share with Trevor and the world, but now I would trade it all just to watch you grow up, to see the brave and certain man I know you will become. Happy birthday Sean, love Daddy.\" that did it, soon the tears were flowing down my cheeks. I hated myself for crying over a man I barely knew, especially in front of Ellie. Amazingly enough, she just rested her head on my shoulder, her own tears falling. Trevor came over and pulled me away from her and into a hug. I cried into his shirt. Soon we were all back in the tree house, Ellie and I sitting on the hammock bed. Ellie was resting against me, her head on my shoulder while my arm was around her waist. She looked like she was about to fall asleep. I never thought I would need someone as much as I needed her right now. I had just found out my dad was dead and had cried and she hadn't said a bad word to me. Instead she comforted me, made me feel truly wanted. Hannah and Trevor were talking amongst themselves, sometimes glancing at us. \"According to Max's journal we're here, surrounded by lava during periods of intense seismic activity.\" there was a large rumble and I instinctively gripped Ellie closer to me. \"The magma around us will soon turn into a big oven.\" Trevor finished. \"Is that what happened to my dad?\" I asked. Hannah and Trevor looked a little uneasily at each other then at me. I sighed irritably as I stood up, gently placing Ellie along the hammock. She snuggled into it. \"Look I know I'm just a kid but I can handle this.\" I whispered. They shared another look and nodded. \"Max was planning an escape.\" Trevor said quietly, catching on that I wanted Ellie to get some rest. \"His research here says that temperatures down here can reach up to two hundred degrees.\" Hannah added. \"The average human being can't withstand more then one hundred and thirty five.\" Trevor muttered lowly. I quickly check a thermometer I had pack. \"It's already ninety five degrees.\" I said quickly. \"It was already eighty two when we got here and rising-fast.\" Trevor warned. \"So what do we do?\" Hannah asked. \"We follow Max's plan. Here's what he wrote: my analyses of the original Verne text leads me to believe that across the ocean due north from here there is a geyser-like river that could lead me back to the surface..\" Trevor read aloud. \"So we find the geyser and hitch a ride topside?\" I asked. Trevor still looked unsure. \"It's a little more complicated then that, see it could get so hot down here that the water could just evaporate.\" he explained. \"How much time do we have?\" Hannah asked worriedly. \"Fort-eight hours, seventy-two tops.\" Trevor said before another rumble sounded. Ellie moaned as she rolled over and I quickly checked on her. She seemed to be cradling her hurt arm. \"Probably less.\" Trevor mumbled. \"Ok so the question is, what is the quickest way across the ocean?\" Hannah asked. I finished checking on Ellie and turned back to the adults. They appeared to be getting no where with their ideas. I glanced around and saw my dads book sitting open on the table. The picture on the page was of a crudely made boat with a weird kite sail. I grinned as I picked it up and handed it to Trevor. \"It's all in the book.\" I said triumphantly. Trevor grinned at me then seemed to notice something. \"Are you tired Sean?\" he asked. It was then that my pure exhaustion hit me head on. I stumbled slight, gripping the table for balance. Trevor smiled warmly. \"Maybe you should follow Ellie's example and get some sleep, we'll wake you when we need your help with the raft.\" he said, standing up and walking out with Hannah following, throwing me a smug smile as she left. I rolled my eyes but couldn't stop the smile that formed at the chance to share a bed with the girl I loved. Carefully, so not to wake her, I slipped back into place beside Ellie. She must have missed my warmth or something because as soon as I lay down she rolled over and snuggled into my side. I sighed, never feeling so at peace, considering my situation. \"I love you.\" I mumbled quietly into her hair before I fell asleep. Hope you liked it! Review![Chapter 9] Sorry everything is taking so long but here is the next update! Enjoy! Ellie's POV After the whole finding Max issue, Sean and I had grown closer then ever. It was…weird, in a nice kind of way. Whenever I fell asleep, Sean was holding me tightly while whispering softly in my ear and when I woke up he was watching me with kind chocolate coloured eyes. I was loving the attention but couldn't help but wonder why he was giving it to me. I hadn't done anything special. Well I did comfort him the most when we found his dad, but by the end of the night he was the one cradling me while I slept. I'm glad he did that, I kept rolling on my arm. I didn't want to worry anyone, but it was really starting to hurt and was going slightly grey. there were still some flecks of metal stuck there, the ones that hurt to much to pick out. I knew that if I told Sean he would get really overprotective and make us stop working on the raft to take care of me. If he did that then we would never finish on time. It's no big deal I can wait until we get home before I tell them, it's not like it's serious. \"Ouch,\" I cried, jumping as a sharp twig brushed over my arm. I checked to see if there was any blood. Just a little, but it was darker then usual. Nothing to worry about. \"Ellie can you hand me that branch?\" Hannah asked. I nodded and heaved it up to hand it to her. It was a lot harder then I thought it would be to lift ad by the time I had it in my harms I was puffing and panting. Sean was next to me in a second, discarding his own branch to help me with mine. \"Go away,\" I muttered to him, hating how weak I was becoming around him. He scowled as he heaved it up onto his shoulder before walking it over to Hannah. I couldn't help but marvel at his strength, feeling my mouth water slightly. I started to feel light-headed as a hot flush rushed through my body. Just as I started to sway I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"Ellie are you okay?\" he asked cautiously. I shook my head, clearing it from its haze before giving him a smile. \"Yeah I'm fine. I'm just goanna head down to the beach for bit.\" I mumbled tiredly. He looked unsure but nodded before turning back to the raft with Hannah. I turned and headed down to the beach, kicking a pebble as I went. When I reached the shore I sat down, my head swimming. I don't know what's wrong with me today. This morning I didn't want to wake up, having a headache, then I didn't want to eat anything until Sean force-fed me a banana he had found and now I can barely stand for more then five minutes. My eyelids started to droop and I realised that I was seriously tired. Laying down on the sand, I let my eyes close and soon I was asleep. I dreamed on the beach. Everything was blurry with shapes darting around everywhere. I felt hot and bothered, my hands shaking as I ran. Someone was next to me, pulling me along while screaming something. I had a moment of clear vision and saw it was Sean. He was screaming at me to keep moving, saying the T-rex was going to catch us. Suddenly I was on the floor, a huge crevice between me and Sean. \"Ellie keep running!\" he shouted at me but I couldn't move, only watch as he took a run up before leaping the crevice, just missing the edge with his feet but catching it with his hands. I threw myself down, gripping his arms tightly and pulling as hard as I could. Sean scrabbled against the edge but he couldn't get up, no matter how hard we tried. \"Ellie just run! Let me go! You're more important!\" he shouted. I could feel tears streaming down my cheeks as I shook my head. \"No, we can make it together!\" I cried. He gave me a sad smile. \"I love you Ellie.\" he said softly before forcing his hands from mine, plummeting into the fiery chasm. \"NO SEAN!\" I cried, rolling into a ball as I sobbed over the death of the boy I loved. I sat bolt upright in the sand before falling back down again, to weak to move. I don't know how long I'd been lying on this beach but I really wanted to go back to the tree house and sleep more. I couldn't fall asleep out here, who knows what's out here. I tried to force myself to sit up, but just couldn't find the strength. I tumbled back into the sand, whimpering slightly from the pain in my arm. \"Sean.\" I cried weakly, praying to anyone who was listening that he would come and find me. \"She said she was going down to the beach! I'll see if she's still-ELLIE!\" I heard a voice cry before a shape was on their knees beside me. It rolled me onto my back and once again I was staring back into Sean's eyes. \"Sean?\" I grumbled, trying to roll back over but he stopped me, helping me sit up. \"I don't feel so good.\" I mumbled weakly. \"It's okay Ellie. I'm goanna take you to Trevor and Hannah, they'll help you. They have to.\" He said determinedly as he lifted me into his arms. I groaned, rolling into his chest. Just as I was about to doze off I was placed in our hammock by Sean before I was surrounded by the rest of the gang. \"I don't know what's wrong with her but she has a fever and can't sit up.\" Sean said hurriedly to them. \"Has she been exposed to anything dangerous? Besides everything else here?\" Hannah asked. I could hear Sean struggling to come up with an answer. \"She was hit by some of the metal shards when the sensor exploded a few days ago b-but she said she was fine.\" he said hysterically, pacing in front of me. There was a tense silence. \"Let me look.\" Trevor said, sounding grave. I was to weak to move but hissed in pain as he touched my arm. \"It's just as I thought. She has a mild case of blood poisoning.\" I heard Sean gasp before he was beside me, gently stroking my hair with a trembling hand. \"Is there anything we can do for her?\" he asked with a shaky voice. \"Did anyone bring any medication?\" Trevor asked, sounding urgent. I could hear rustling before Sean cried out. \"I can't find any!\" he sounded desperate. I didn't think I meant that much to him. \"Calm down Sean!\" Hannah said softly. \"Don't tell me to calm down!\" Sean snapped. \"Ellie is dying and there's nothing we can do!\" he sounded like he was going to start crying. \"Don't worry Sean I have some medicine in my backpack.\" Hannah soothed. Sean stopped panicking and came to sit beside me again, going back to wiping my forehead. \"Now the medicine was mixed with some of the water from when we fell so it might not be as effective as we'd like.\" Hannah warned, prepping the needle from the first aid kit. \"Meaning?\" Sean asked. \"There's only a fifty-fifty chance it could work. If she pulls through the night then she'll be okay.\" Hannah answered grimly, giving me the shot. I winced, wishing Sean would hold me some more. I missed his warmth. As if to answer my prayers, Sean climbed into the hammock next to me, pulling me close to him. Using the little strength I had left I snuggled into him, resting my aching head on his chest. The medicine started to kick in and soon I was slipping in and out of consciousness. Throughout the night I slipped in and out of consciousness and every time I woke up Sean was there, staring at me with concerned eyes. At one point I think I must have been hallucinating because when my eyes opened I think I saw Sean, tears running down his cheeks as he placed a kiss on my forehead. \"You can't die Ellie, please. I know you can't hear me but...I love you.\" he chocked out softly. I couldn't find the strength to answer so just fell back asleep, wondering what else I would dream up. Finally morning came along and I slowly opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was Sean's sleeping face, his mouth slightly open as he dreamt. I smiled at the fond scene, wishing I could wake up every morning like this-which I had been doing for the past couple days. Testing how well I had recovered, I sat up. No wooziness so I stood up and walked around. I smiled, glad I was feeling better. \"Ellie, please...please be ok.\" I heard a voice mumble. I turned back to Sean to see him clutching onto one of the pillows Hannah had made tightly. I smiled endearingly at him, walking over and stroking his fringe. He sighed happily, his eyes lazily opening. \"Ellie? Ellie!\" he cried, sitting up and pulling me towards him. I giggled as he sobbed quietly. \"I thought you were goanna die. You have no idea how worried I was.\" he cried. I sighed into him. \"It's ok Sean, I'm fine. Now I really think we should get back to work on the raft.\" I said. He seemed tense for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"Ellie I...I just want to say...\" Why was he so nervous. He sighed in defeated. \"When this is all over...I have something I really want to tell you.\" he said softly. I nodded, taking his hand and leading him outside. I was shocked to see that, sitting on the sand of the beach, was a fully made raft. \"Wow. How long was I out?\" I asked. Sean smiled down at me, squeezing my hand. \"Only two days. Come on, we haven't got much time.\" he said, dragging me towards the raft and sitting me down. I waited for the others to get everything together, having no idea how this raft worked. With a few flicks of the sail, it caught the wind and took flight, dragging it towards the sea. I grabbed Sean's hand as he ran for the raft, Hannah grabbing Trevor. \"It's just a little storm, ain't no big deal!\" Trevor yelled in assurance as the waves crashed, water spraying everywhere. It was pouring down with rain and the sky was a blackish purple color with the frequent bursts of fork shaped lightening which flashed through the sky, brightening it all up for half a second. The thunder rumbled on and on like a thousand slamming doors and windows. Hannah moved toward the side of the boat, drenched by the freezing rain. \"There's something moving down there!\" she cried and I looked over to. \"Probably just plankton! Same thing we saw back at the beach!\" Trevor replied in a bellow. Sean leaned over side next to me, keeping a secure hand on my arm. \"I don't know it looks kinda big for plankton!\" he said, pulling me away from the edge. Ever since my blood poisoning he's been far to protective. \"Sean, we're not at Sea World, so just back up a little!\" ordered Trevor. \"I think it's some sort of fish!\" I yelled, shaking out my hair. Sean suddenly jumped back. I then saw the reason for his sudden movement and yelled out in fright. It was a huge fish, silvery with giant, wide translucent eyes and teeth like knives. It had leapt out at Sean and when he jumped out of the way it went straight for Trevor. He wrestled with it until he finally kicked it off. Soon fish everywhere were jumping out of the water, trying to take a chunk out of us. \"They're everywhere!\" Sean yelled, us standing back to back to protect each other. \"Sean! Ellie! I told you we'd get to the batting cage!\" Trevor shouted back, pulling out three large sticks. We then whacked every fish that leapt out at us, smashing them right out to sea. I noticed one headed for Sean. Instinctively, I whacked at it, making it bounce off the mast and right into another one, knocking both of them into the water. \"Nice shot!\" Sean yelled and I smiled. Hannah mimicked and soon we were all whacking fish away from each other. Then I heard something beeping… a phone? \"Do you hear something?\" Hannah asked. Sean pulled a cell phone out of his pocket. \"Hello? Mom? Mom, I can't hear you...uh, Uncle Trevor, Ellie and I are… sorta on a…a fishing trip… and uh…uh…uhm…oh no it was Ellie's idea...uh\" I followed his gaze and scowled when it was at Hannah's butt. I did a double take and saw a huge fish, mouth gaping open at Hannah's behind. Before I could do anything, Trevor had picked it up and whacked it. \"Uh… Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one… and…\" All of a sudden, a fish had leapt out and caught it with its mouth. \"My phone!\" he cried. I rolled my eyes. \"I'll buy you another one okay...uh Sean?\" I said, pointing to the massive thing moving behind him. \"I got it – Argh!\" An enormous snake-like thing had burst out of the water and jumped onto the raft. Its jaws snapped at Sean, who pushed me behind him. Wait, no. Whatever this thing was, It was going for the fish at his feet. It snagged it and crept back into the sea. Soon enough there was more of them. \"Look! They don't want us they want the fish!\" Trevor yelled us we huddled together in the center of the raft. \"Sean, Ellie you take the tiler, we'll take the front. Hannah, hold the slack!\" He bellowed. Sean and I went to the back while the two adults were at the front. Trevor then told us something not either of us understood. \"What?\" We said together. \"THAT WAY!\" We turned the rudder, and we started going left. \"Now, Hannah, just let it out gently, gently.\" He said to Hannah, who held the rope. \"It's working!\" I shouted, grinning. Sean grinned back before turning to his uncle. \"You're the man, uncle Trev!\" \"That's what I've been trying to tell the scientific community for years!\" Sean and I laughed but then quickly stopped as the sail was jerked forward. Hannah suddenly fell back. \"Hannah!\" Trevor yelled, coming to the back of the boat where my she lay. I noticed the ropes of the sail slipping free. I tapped Sean's arm and he nodded. We both ran forwards towards the ropes. \"Are you okay?\" I yelled to Hannah as I passed but I didn't think she'd heard me. She yelped as Trevor pulled her back to her feet. I got a glimpse of her bleeding hands and winced. Trevor continued to help the struggling woman as Sean and I ran to catch the sail. We pulled and pulled at the sail. Both of us screamed \"NO!\" when it snapped off. We were jerked up and Sean grabbed my waist. \"SEAN! ELLIE!\" The adults yelled out our names. \"TREVOR! HANNAH!\" I screamed back, clutching onto Sean tightly. \"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET GO!\" Sean yelled in my ear over the thunder. I curled myself into him, letting him protect me. \"NO!\" Hannah yelled after us. \"HANG ON! DON'T LET GO!\" Trevor cried out but we were already lost into the sky. There it is, tell me what you think. Review![Chapter 10] Here you go. Enjoy! Sean's POV \"Ow…oh god that hurts.\" I mumbled as I pushed my face off the ground, dusting it free of the…sand? I shook my head, looking around. \"Whoa!\" I cried, coming face to face with one of those fish with the huge teeth. I settled down as I realised it was dead, pushing myself into a kneeling position and looking around some more. I was on a beach, puddles dotted around. Water! I cupped my hands and lifted some of it up to my mouth, only to spit it back out as an awful strong salt flavour washed into my mouth. Turning my head to spit, I noticed the tattered remains of the sail that had dragged me hear. I grimaced, I hope the others were ok. Wait…others…ELLIE! Where was she? I sprang up, looking frantically around for her. I was alone on the beach, not even a set of footprints. I dashed off, slipping through a crevice in the wall and careering through the tunnels, screaming her name at the top of my lungs. \"ELLIE! ELLIE WHERE ARE YOU!\" I cried, searching everywhere I could for her. After nearly an hour I felt like giving up, collapsing onto the ground in a hopeless heap. I cried helplessly for Ellie, never getting the chance to tell her I loved her. An echoed tweeting sound interrupted my grieving. I looked up to see a familiar looking luminescent bird hovering near me. I sniffed loudly. \"Hey little guy.\" I mumbled. The bird tweeted again, flicking its small head in the direction of another slim tunnel. I heaved myself into a standing position, following the small bird. \"I don't know what you're trying to do, there's not much that can make this…better…\" I trailed off as I stopped in front a familiar shape, curled near a small shower of water as it washed a long cut in its arm. I just stood there, waiting for her to notice me. She must have felt something because she turned to look at me, her eyes widening. \"Sean?\" she whispered. I nodded. Slowly she stood up, her task of washing her arm forgotten as she slowly walked towards me. I moved as well, encircling my arms around her waist as she stepped into my embrace. \"I was scared you had died. I thought I was never going to see you agai-\" I leaned down and captured her lips in a searing kiss. I never thought something like this could feel so good. I pulled her closer, emotions exploding everywhere within my heart and stomach. She responded immediately, her arms wrapping around my neck and pulling us closer together. I don't know how much time we spent just kissing but soon we pulled away from each other. \"What was that for?\" Ellie asked with a small grin. I smiled down at her, my forehead leaning on hers. \"To keep me sane enough to get you out of here so we can go on a proper date.\" I said truthfully. A grin broke out onto my angels face. I smiled back, taking her hand and leading her back over to the small water fall. I took a quick drink before finishing the job on her arm. Realising I had no bandages I ripped off one of my sleeves and wrapped it around her arm. \"Really Sean, you don't have to.\" Ellie tried to say but I could tell she already appreciated having her wound covered. Once we were done I took her hand and followed the bird back out of the tunnel. \"Come, the river's north so we follow south.\" he mumbled. I stopped. \"Shouldn't we go north then?\" she asked. I smiled, wrapping an arm around her waist. \"The polarity is reversed. My uncle told me while you were unconscious.\" I explained as we started on our journey. For a few hours we just walked, sometimes talking about what we were goanna be doing once we got home. I decided to be truthful and told her I wanted to take her out on a date. I wasn't goanna drop the 'I love you' bomb until at least one date. Eventually we came to an open area of flat ground. Well, when I say open I mean a wide stretch between our entrance and the exit of the cave. I gave Ellie a smile, glad to be close to being out of this maze. I took a few steps out, feeling Ellie hesitate beside me. \"Sean, something doesn't feel right.\" I just chuckled, trying to act cool. \"Don't worry, it's fi-\" I couldn't finish my sentence, tripping over a loose rock. I landed flat on my front, grimacing as Ellie giggled. As I was pushing myself up I noticed my pocket knife floating in mid air. \"Sean…what's going on?\" Ellie asked, coming to stand beside me. I just stared at th knife, then at my compass. The needle was pointing all over the place. \"I get it.\" I mumbled before turning to her. \"A magnetic field.\" Ellie nodded in understanding. \"You ready?\" I asked, taking her hand in mine. She nodded determinedly and we dashed forwards. Rumbles groaned out under our feet as we sprinted. Was it just me or were the rocks moving under our feet? My assumption was proven correct as Ellie's foot landed on a loose rock, sending it down instead of kicking it away. We stared at each other. \"Magnetic rocks?\" she asked and I shrugged. I grabbed Ellie's hand with my own again, noting that it was signifiguntly more clammy then before, yet I didn't pull away. Ellie's hand was pulsating with heat, making my hand ever clammier. I was shivering, but I was hot. I looked at her and smiled lightly. \"Let's just get this over with shall we?\" I squeezed my hand reassuringly, \"Just follow my lead.\" she nodded, hoping nothing would go wrong. Once we reached the edge of the cliff, I let go of Ellie's hand and an empty, pathetic feeling filled my heart. I looked at the rocks that were in front of us. I sucked in a deep breath, took one step back and jumped to the first floating rock. I felt my heart race, like it was going to come out of my chest. I sighed once my legs stopped shaking and looked back at Ellie. \"Okay, once I jump to the next rock; you jump to the one I'm standing on okay?\" I instructed. She looked like she wanted to nod, but it looked like she was having a fit. I was worried, but jumped to the next rock. Just like the first rock, I was shaky at first, but slowly regained my control. It was my her now. I watched he walk backwards a good three or four steps, close her eyes, then started running forwards and took a leap of faith. She wasn't as graceful as I was; she landed on her hands and knees making the rock lurch forward and crash into mine. \"Shit!\" she screamed as my rock moved farther away from her. I was gripping the rock with my hands so tightly my knuckles were turning white. Once I was steady I looked up to see Ellie's rock slowly starting to turn upside down. I lost all rational thought at seeing the girl I love in danger. \"Hold on tight!\" I cried. All I could do was watch as she did what I said. I watched as he rock slowly started to flip upside down. It didn't look good for a good minute. \"Sean! I can't hold on anymore!\" she screamed. I just wanted to be in her place, just so she could be safe. \"Move your body forward! The momentum will help the rock flip over!\" I ordered. I watched as she slowly tilted her body forwards, when she was finally right side up again, she was only half way across. How was she going to get across? \"Sean! What do I do?\" she cried. I said the first thing that registered in my mind. \"Paddle?\" she gave me her famous 'Are you kidding me?' look. That was actually the smartest idea I had. She started \"paddling\" the air with her hands. Soon she reached my side, collapsing in my arms as I pulled her to safety. \"I need to rest for a bit.\" she panted. \"Why?\" I asked dumbly. \"My arms feel like lead are about ready to give out you dunce!\" she snapped. I chuckled lightly. \"Ah.\" just then the bird, or Tweeters, flittered past, giving us a 'come on' look. \"You try doing that without wings!\" I snapped up at him. Ellie laughed, leaning against my chest as Tweeters looked as sheepish as a bird could. There it is. I think this is the furthest a Journey To The Centre Of The Earth Fanfiction has gotten. I dare anyone to out do me. Review! Don't forget to check out my on going or coming up Fics, I'm posting trailers on my profile-PM me if you think they'll be good.[Chapter 11] Here's the last chapter. It's a little long but I wanted to end it in Ellie's POV Enjoy! Ellie's POV Sean kissed me! He kissed me. It was definitely the pick me up I needed after waking up on a beach, all alone with my arm reopened. I'm so glad Sean was there to catch me when I got to the other side. Although undoubtedly one of the most idiotic things I had ever heard, paddling was the right way to go. We were walking again, following the brilliantly named Tweeters as he lead us out of the tunnels and into a huge wasteland. \"Trevor?\" Sean shouted. \"Hannah?\" I called. We walked for what felt like hours but was really only twenty minutes, crossing the wasteland. Sean was still calling for his uncle but my strength was fading quickly. We stopped, standing on a small hill. Sean took that time to stop, wiping his forehead then checking his compass. I looked over his shoulder to see that we were heading south. According to Sean that meant we were heading north but I was to tired to care. \"Come on, we need to keep going.\" Sean panted, jumping down from the hill before turning to help my down. I jumped into his arms, knowing he would catch me. As I steadied myself I noticed that Sean wasn't looking at me, but at something over my shoulder. I turned to see a whole T-Rex head buried in the sand. I jumped in freight, Sean's arms gripping me tighter. \"Jesus Christ!\" I cried. I felt Sean nod. \"I really wish I'd read that book.\" he mumbled, more to himself then me. I turned to look at him. \"You haven't even read the book?\" I yelled. Sean blushed. \"I read half of it.\" he offered. I just rolled my eyes before wrapping my arms around his neck. \"It's a good thing you're cute.\" I mumbled before giving him a soft kiss. He grinned as I pulled away. \"I'm already loving the new you.\" he laughed. The new me? \"What was wrong with the old me?\" I asked him seriously. His face flushed. \"N-Nothing. I-I was just saying-\" I didn't want to hear it. Boys were all the same…only interested in one thing. \"Forget it Sean! Lets just get home!\" I snapped, pulling myself away from him…no matter how much it hurt. His face fell, his mouth hanging open. As I began to stomp off I froze when I heard a growl. I slowly turned to see Sean looking around. He quickly ran at me, taking my hand and leading me behind some rocks. \"Come on we need to hide!\" he said desperately, pulling me against him. I pulled myself away. \"Don't touch me!\" I snapped. He looked sorry, but quickly covered it up with anger. The growling started up again and I pressed myself against the rock. Sean was still looking around, jumping whenever the ground shook. I was scared but I wasn't going to show it. Slowly, Sean peeked around the side. I did the same on my side, seeing nothing. Just as I was starting to relax a glob of god knows what splattered on the floor in front of us. Sean and I shared a look before we both looked up. Standing above us, towering over the rocks, was a fully grown, teeth barred T-Rex. Sean looked like he was going to have a heart attack as another bucket load of slobber dropped onto his face. No way in hell am I kissing that now. He wiped his face in a quick swipe. The T-Rex roared again before slamming its head down. I just managed to pull Sean away before he became a human happy meal. We started running, sprinting away from the beast and towards a large group of caves. The T-Rex followed, smashing right through a arch of solid rock. I cried out as a rock struck my leg, causing me to stumble. Sean instantly grabbed me, pulling up and pushed me ahead of him. We reached a cave and he pushed me through the small opening, diving in after me. We scrambled to the back, Sean placing himself between me and the T-Rex. The T-Rex peeked in, staring at us with one eye before smashing a hole in the cave wall big enough to fit his nose in. Sean and I started screaming, letting all the fear loose as the T-Rex's face came within centimetres of Sean. We were goanna die. We were goanna die and I never got to tell Sean I love him. Sean turned to look at me, seeming to forget about the monster trying to eat us. \"Ellie I'm so sorry for implying that I didn't like you before I revealed that I wanted to be your boyfriend.\" he was apologising for something that I overreacted about? He was to perfect. \"Do you remember when I told you I wanted to tell you something when we got home?\" I nodded. He took my hands in his, stroking the backs of them with his thumbs. \"I love you. I've always loved you, ever since we were thirteen. If we're going to die now then I at least wanted you to know.\" he confessed. I felt my eyes water. I took his face in my hands. \"I love you to Sean…even when you act like a complete idiot. I'm so sorry that I acted so rudely to something you meant as a compliment.\" I said with a smile before placing my lips on his in a sweet kiss. He returned it, gripping me around my waist tightly. We broke apart as the T-Rex pushed its head further into our cave. Sean pulled me closer to him, stroking my head with a shaky hand as he whispered that he loved over and over in my ear. \"Sean? Ellie?\" A muffled voice shouted over our screams. Our heads snapped up together and we turned to the cave wall. \"Trevor!\" Sean shouted. I could hear a banging sound and the wall was shaking. Was he trying to break through solid rock? A second later a hole was smashed into the wall by a stick wielding maniac. I'll take that as a yes. Sean was grabbed first but he pushed me forwards. \"Take Ellie first!\" he shouted, taking Trevor's hand off his arm and placing it on mine. Trevor tugged me through then immediately pulled Sean through. Sean tumbled through into me. I gripped him tightly, he holding onto me for dear life. \"Boy am I glad to see you two.\" Trevor panted. We both nodded at him. \"Yeah…you too.\" Sean panted. \"Are you guys alright?\" Trevor asked. We both nodded. Another roar sounded from behind Trevor, who jumped. \"Maybe we should go.\" he suggested and we nodded again. As we all haled ourselves to our feet Sean stopped. \"Wait! Is that the geyser?\" Sean asked. Trevor nodded, looking distressed. \"Yeah that's where we're going!\" a deafening crash sounded behind us as the T-Rex smashed through the caves. We all screamed as we bolted towards the geyser, the T-Rex's footsteps thundering behind us. \"What is that?\" Trevor yelled. Hasn't he ever seen a freaking dinosaur before? \"Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?\" Sean shouted to his uncle. Thank you Sean. \"Not one with skin on it!\" Trevor shouted back. He had a point there. I snuck a glance behind us to see the T-Rex gaining on us. \"He's to fast guys, we're not goanna make it.\" I shouted. Trevor looked over at me but his eyes travelled further. Suddenly he darted away from us, heading over to where he was looking. \"Trevor what are you doing?\" Sean shouted after him. \"That's muscovite it's the same kind from the cave before!\" he explained. Trevor you're a genius! \"There's no way it's goanna hold you!\" Trevor you're dead. \"It can't hold him either! You guys keep running!\" he was risking his life for us. Sean gave me a panicked look. He had just got his uncle back he couldn't loose him, not after loosing his father-it could kill him. \"Trevor no!\" his voice was covered by a loud cracking noise as the T-Rex stepped onto the muscovite. Nothing happened, the T-Rex just continued to gain on Trevor \"It's not working Trevor!\" I yelled at him. \"Keep running!\" he ordered. \"It's gaining on you Trevor.\" Sean warned. \"I know just keep running!\" he screamed at us. I grabbed Sean's hand, squeezing it tightly. Suddenly one of the loudest cracking noises I ever heard sounded as the T-Rex's foot smashed through the floor. \"Trevor it's working!\" Sean shouted, switching his tone. Everything was going great, until Sean and I both realised at the same time that the muscovite was also breaking under Trevor. \"Run Trevor!\" I shouted as a huge cracking sounded and Trevor and the dinosaur, along with the floor, disappeared. \"No!\" cried Sean, heading over to the gap. I followed, watching for any more muscovite. We reached the edge and Sean collapsed to his knees, looking over the edge. \"Trevor!\" he shouted. He was met with grunting as two hands gripped the edge. \"I just remembered something.\" he grunted, pulling himself up higher. \"I hate field work!\" Sean laughed as he pulled his uncle up onto the ground. \"That was amazing, and the ground…and the T-Rex. Then you were.\" Sean blabbered. I laughed as Trevor took it all in. \"Yeah…really lucky.\" he grunted, stretching slightly. I smiled, walking over to him and wrapping my arms around his waist in a hug. \"You did great Trevor.\" I mumbled into his chest. He wrapped his arms around my shoulders, hugging me tiredly. \"Ok come on.\" he gasped tiredly. We nodded and headed off towards the geyser. We ran through the caves, feeling the heat intensify as we reached the river. \"How are we going to get to the geyser? The waters boiling.\" Sean asked, my hand held in his. \"I don't know, we need something that floats.\" Trevor mumbled, wiping his face. The heat was almost unbearable, my eyes stinging with tears. Sean rubbed the back of my hand with his thumb. Just as we were starting to realise our luck had run out, a shape floated down through the steam, a shape in the form of the top half of a familiar T-Rex head. And the one steering it was my favourite blonde European tour guide…Hannah. \"Who had dibs again?\" she asked. Trevor and Sean both pointed at each other. I raised an eyebrow at Sean, who blushed sheepishly before wrapping an arm around my waist. I smirked at him before pointing at Trevor. Hannah chuckled as she pulled the skull closer. \"She's the best mountain guide on the planet.\" I said as I jumped into the skull. Hannah smiled at me, drawing me into a hug. \"And you're the best client I've ever had.\" I smiled as I hugged her back. We separated and Hannah looked over my head to Trevor. \"You didn't really think you could scare me away did you?\" she asked and Trevor smiled sheepishly. I snuck away over to Sean, leaning against him. \"You'll have to try harder then that.\" she finished with a chuckle as she rowed. \"You know I'm still billing you right?\" Hannah quipped. \"Can I open a tab?\" Trevor joked. I would have laughed if I hadn't felt a jolt knock the boat to the side. \"What was that?\" Sean asked, wrapping a secure arm around me. Trevor took a small flashlight and shined it on the river. \"It's the river bed.\" he said and the boat rocked some more. \"You might want to hold on.\" he advised. Sean lowered us into a sitting position, keeping me pressed against him. The boat rocked more, throwing us about until it flew from the river bed and flew down into a large pit. I screamed and Sean held me tighter, slipping an arm around my shoulders to cradle my head. The skull came to a sudden halt, causing me to hit my head on Sean's outstretched arm. We all groaned as we sat up. Sean stood up to look over the edge. \"What's that light down there?\" Sean asked. I joined him, as did Trevor. \"That's lava, well magma and it's rising.\" he declared, sounding grim. \"Shouldn't there be water or steam or something?\" Sean asked frantically. \"We're to late for the geyser, we missed it.\" Trevor said. Sean looked even more frantic, gripping my hand tightly. \"What do we do Trevor?\" \"Do you have any suggestions professor?\" Hannah asked. Trevor ran his hands through his hair in frustration. \"Look without water there's no steam and without steam there's no geyser and it looks like there hasn't been any water for about two or three hours now.\" Trevor yelled. Sean still looked determined. \"But the walls are still wet!\" \"That's impossible it's a hundred and thirty degrees down here.\" Trevor argued. I looked at the wall and saw that Sean was right. \"Will you stop being so negative and look at the damn wall!\" I shouted at Trevor, who's eyes widened. Sean smiled down at me. \"I have never loved you more.\" he said with a grin. I grinned back, leaning up to kiss him. \"It is wet. And cold.\" Trevor said, hitting the wall. \"There's water behind here, maybe in a pocket or something.\" as Trevor continued I sneaked another look over the edge to see the lava had gotten closer. \"Guys it's getting closer.\" I warned. Trevor leaned down over the edge of the skull, brushing his fingers against some white stuff on the wall. \"Hey, magnesium.\" the skull jolted and I stumbled over to the side. Sean grabbed my arm, pulling me away from the edge. \"Guy's we're slipping.\" Sean warned. \"Flare.\" Trevor demanded and I handed him one. \"What are you going to do?\" I asked as he took it. \"I'm goanna light the magnesium, and this time on purpose.\" he answered, lighting the flare and pressing it against the wall. All that happened was the flare simmering out. \"Damn! It's to wet. Give me another.\" he demanded. Ok Mr bossy here's your flare. I handed him another and he leaned further over the edge. \"Grab my legs.\" he said and we all grabbed a part of his legs and lowered him further down. Once again, the wall was to wet and the flare simmered out. Sean and I pulled Trevor up as Hannah grabbed some rope. \"You're goanna have to tie me off I've gotta get down lower.\" he sounded scared. Sean looked back over the edge. \"Trevor I-it's getting closer.\" he said fearfully. I grabbed his hand again, pressing the flare into it. \"It's goanna be ok Sean. We'll get out of here and then have that date you promised.\" I said comfortingly. \"Date? What date?\" Trevor asked loudly as Hannah finished tying him to the T-Rex skull. I blushed as Sean cleared his throat, stepping away from me to light the flare. \"It's the last one.\" he said gravely as he handed it to Trevor. He all held our breath as Trevor leaned over the side, Hannah feeding him rope. Slowly Trevor was lowered towards the rapidly rising lava. The skull jolted again, causing me to scrape m side against the skull. I ignored the pain, to focused on getting out alive. Once he reached a good level he pressed the flare against the wall. Sean was watching his uncle carefully, gripping the edge until his knuckles turned white. When nothing happened I saw Trevor looking to the other side. \"It's still wet down here I'm goanna have to throw it to the other side.\" he's going to do what? Before I could object to his idea he threw the flare. I held my breath as it flew across the gap and hit the other side. A spark flared up in the wall and I felt my hope rise. He gripped Sean's hand tightly, but the spark flickered out taking my hope with it. \"NO!\" Trevor cried. I sighed in defeat, leaning on Sean. \"It's over. We're going to die.\" I mumbled, feeling my tears slide down my cheeks. Sean wrapped an arm around me. \"I love you Ellie.\" he chocked into my hair. I would have kissed him, if it hadn't been for an explosion and Trevor screaming. I turned to see the magnesium alight and growing, blowing a hole in the wall. \"Pull me up! Pull me up!\" Trevor shouted as water spewed from the hole. We pulled as quick as we could, getting him up as the water hit the lava. \"Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!\" he cried as we pulled him over. As soon as he was over he pushed us to the floor. \"Get down it's goanna blow.\" we all hit the floor, me curling into Sean's side while he wrapped an arm around me. The steam hit the bottom of the skull and we, along with the skull, were thrown upwards. Rocketing upwards at over a hundred miles per hour is not as much fun as I thought it would be. \"This thing's heating up!\" Sean cried. I realised that it was, but most of my body was resting on Sean's. \"I know! Hang on!\" Trevor cried, protecting Sean and Hannah's heads with his arms. \"Trust me I'm hanging on!\" Hannah shouted back. We kept going for a few more seconds before a blue dot appeared ahead of us. \"Is that sky?\" I asked. Sean gasped, pulling me closer. Within three seconds we were out, fresh air filling my senses. I let out a relieved sigh. \"I love thiiiiiisssssss!\" I screamed as we started falling again. \"Hang on everybody!\" Trevor shouted. \"Shut up!\" I shouted at him as Hannah shouted. \"Stop saying that!\" \"It just keeps coming up!\" Trevor defended. I would have answered but the skull smashing into the ground took the breath from my lungs. I tried sitting up, only to be hit in the face by a load of berries. I turned to see Hannah getting hit with some to and Trevor was laughing at her, only to be hit with some himself. Sean laughed at him before turning to me, laughing all the harder. I sneered at him before chucking a handful of berries at him, splattering them all over his face and chest. He gave me a humours smile before his eyes widened. He grabbed my head and pulled it down, tucking it safely into his chest. I heard a loud smash as the skull came to a halt, a few pieces of rubble raining down on my head. I carefully uncurled myself from Sean. \"Thanks.\" I mumbled smiling at him. He looked like he was going to answer, but was interrupted by Trevor. \"Hey it's mount Vesuvius. Sean, Ellie if your mothers ask what we did this weekend, uncle Trevor took you to Italy.\" he said, pointing a finger at us. We both nodded. I jumped again as a man ran around the corner, babbling useless Italian while staring at us. I turned to see him pointing at a wreaked trail we had torn down his mountain. Sean perked up, looking like he had an idea. Quickly he reached into his bag and pulled out a shiny rock. My eyes widened as he hopped out of the skull and over to the man. I followed him. \"Sean?\" his uncle asked, holding up a bag full of diamonds, emeralds and rubies. I quickly felt my chest, sighing in relief as I felt Sean's crystal was still safely around my neck. \"What, so I took a few geological samples.\" he defended. I raised an eyebrow. \"A few geological samples?\" he chuckled, smiling. \"Ok so a few pounds of geological samples but what do you expect I'm a scientists son.\" he answered. I smiled, letting him wrap an arm around my waist as he turned back to the Italian man. \"Uh…you take this. Take this.\" he said in a really bad Italian accent. The mans eyes widened as he took the crystal. \"You want…slide again?\" he asked and I laughed. Suddenly his eyes widened and he made an oh sound. Me and Sean both turned to see Trevor and Hannah in the middle of a passionate kiss. I smirked as I turned to Sean, grabbing his neck and pulling his face closer to mine. \"How about we follow their example?\" I asked with a sly smile. He grinned as he pressed his lips to mine. \"Mm, berries.\" he mumbled against my lips. I sighed as I exited Trevor's apartment, Sean's hand holding mine. We were getting ready to go to the airport, finally heading to Canada. I was still wearing Sean's crystal around my neck, the shoelace replaced by a smooth black cord. Everyday Sean would look for it, kiss me then tell me I looked beautiful. \"So tomorrow you guys are going to be Canadians?\" Hannah asked. Oh I forgot to mention that Hannah moved down from Iceland to be with Trevor. We had exchanged numbers and e-mail addresses and were hoping to keep in touch. \"Yep.\" Sean answered as Trevor started singing the Canadian national anthem. I laughed, burying my face in Sean's shoulder. \"I'd say that was a lot of male…\" I raised an eyebrow at Trevor. \"…and female bonding packed into a very short amount of time. How about we take a couple weeks next time?\" my face lit up as I kneeled down next to Sean as he started fiddling with his new backpack. \"A couple weeks?\" I asked. \"Yeah, what are you guys doing over Christmas break?\" he asked. \"Probably freezing our butts off.\" I answered and Sean laughed. \"We're free.\" he answered simply. Trevor grinned. \"I found this in your dads stuff.\" he said, handing Sean a book. I looked over his shoulder to see the word Atlantis on the cover. \"The lost city of Atlantis?\" Sean mumbled, opening the first couple pages. He quickly shut the book, handing it to me as he got out an energy bar, crushed it up and emptied into a pocket in his bag. I heard a familiar tweeting sound and smiled. \"Sean, Ellie, what is that?\" Trevor asked. I smirked. \"Our new pet.\" I answered as Tweeters hopped out the pocket. \"Do you think our moms will let us keep him?\" Sean asked. As Trevor stammered for an answer Tweeters fluttered up into the sky, coming to land on my outstretched finger. \"Who cares, you're ours.\" I mumbled, stroking his back. \"Yeah.\" Sean agreed, slipping behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist and placing his chin on my shoulder. \"I love you.\" he mumbled into my neck. \"I love you to.\" I said back, kissing the tip of his nose. I smiled, turning my head to give him a quick kiss. I never thought a trip to the centre of the earth would turn out to be the best vacation ever. There you go, first finished Journey To The Centre Of The Earth fic that follows the story. Review and check out any fics and trailers I have written. I will not let you down :)! ","Summary":" Here's a new story Disclaimer: I do not Own Journey To The Centre Of The Earth, just Ellie and any "},{"Movie":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","Title":"Once In A Lifetime Opportunity","Author":"x.x.Beth C.x.x","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5232606","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: This is my first Journey to the Center of the Earth fanfiction. It's a SeanXOC story and I tried to make my OC Lydia as un-Mary Sue as possible. And also to make it different, I made Lydia Hannah's much younger sister even though she is thirteen and Hannah is in her twenties. I know it's kind of weird but just try to overlook it. \"Lydia, dinner's on the table!\" My sister yelled. I came trudging down the stairs in my socks, black sweatpants, grey singlet and brown jumper. I'd just had a shower. My long brown hair dripped as I walked. I then sat on the stool at the kitchen counter, eating the soup Hannah had provided. There was a knock at the door which made me jump. She stifled at laugh at my reaction, and then yelled out. \"I'm sorry I don't speak Icelandic,\" A man's voice replied from outside. I inclined my head to the door but quickly turned back to my soup as she opened it. \"Hi can I help you?\" Hannah asked the visitor. \"I'm Hannah,\" She introduced when there was no response from the stranger. \"Oh, how do you do? Hi, I'm Professor Anderson, visiting from America. Uh, this is-\" \"I'm Sean,\" A different-sounding voice said. \"My nephew,\" The other person added. \"Hi, Sean. This is my younger sister, Lydia,\" Hannah motioned for me to come. I slumped off the seat and wrapped my arms around my torso because of the freezing wind blowing through the door. I took a glance at the two boys. One was older, he looked twenty-something * I know Brendan Fraser's actually in his fourties but I'm pretending he's not so he can seem young enough for Hannah to date* , and had brown hair and brown eyes and his muscles sort of showed through his shirt. The other one looked about my age of thirteen, and had scruffy brown hair and brown eyes. He was definitely attractive. Distractingly attractive. I coughed deliberately when he met my glance and looked at the ground, feeling awkward. \"I was wondering,\" The older man said, \"if I could speak to... Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson?\" My sister and I exchanged frowns. \"Well, um... Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson is dead,\" Hannah reported sadly. I looked up at the strangers. \"Dead?\" The younger guy said, surprised. I then spoke. \"Yes, he died three winters ago.\" I was quiet, but I was sure they heard me. \"Oh, um so do you run the institute?\" The scientist man asked. \"Nobody does. There is no institute,\" Hannah said, confused. \"But there was a sign down the road that said –\" \"Progressive volcanology was a failed idea,\" She explained, grimacing at the memory. \"Oh, I see. Uh, did you work with him?\" The older man questioned. Hannah and I traded glances again. \"No, he was our father,\" I said. I had the feeling we were going to get to know these Americans from that moment on. A/N: Well there's the first chapter. Review if you liked it.[Chapter 2] I listened to Hannah and Trevor's conversation about someone named ... was it Max Anderson? I think he was Trevor's brother and Sean's father. \"Your brother was a vernion,\" Hannah said, holding our father's book up to compare it to Max's copy. \"Wow,\" Sean said, \"my dad was... out there.\" \"You didn't know him, Sean,\" Trevor argued. \"I'm starting to think you didn't either,\" Sean muttered, taking dad's book. After a while my sister spoke. I just sipped my hot chocolate. \"What are you guys doing here?\" \"I'm a scientist, I'm a professor. I'm here because there are seismic sensors and we think we should check into it. That's why we're here. Plain and simple,\" Trevor said. I raised my eyebrows. \"Okay,\" Hannah said, \"you know there's no road up North. I'm a mountain guide, I –\" I cleared my throat – \" We can take you.\" She corrected herself. \"Thanks, that'd be great.\" \"No problem, Professor,\" Hannah said, putting dad's book away. \"Call me Trevor,\" he said. \"You can call me Sean,\" the boy added. I snorted. Sean looked at me sort of curiously. I shifted my eyes away from his slowly and gulped my hot chocolate, then choked when it burned my throat. \"Five thousand,\" Hannah told them the cost. \"A day, no problem,\" Trevor said. \"An hour,\" Hannah corrected. \"Do you accept rolls of quarters?\" Sean asked. I smiled a little. He looked at me again with that same interested expression. I blinked twice, and he was looking at my sister again. * That night, Sean took my bed and I slept on the couch in the living room. Hannah lent Trevor her bed as she slept on a mattress on the floor next to my couch. They both tried to protest against the hospitality but Hannah wouldn't take no for an answer. Sean helped me make his bed. I got the feeling he was looking at me again. I felt awkward. \"Uh, I'll get you another blanket. It can get pretty cold up here some nights.\" He smiled at me warmly. \"Thanks.\" \"No problem,\" I sighed as I went to the cupboard and pulled out a huge quilt. \"So its Lydia isn't it?\" Sean asked. \"Yep,\" I answered. I shook loose strands of my brown hair out of my face. \"So, what do you and Hannah normally do around here?\" He asked as I handed him the other end of the quilt. \"Hannah's a mountain guide, as you found out before, so I go on errands with her.\" \"So you hike a lot?\" \"You could say that,\" I shrugged as we threw the quilt up to spread it out. \"Other times we're just stuck in here. It gets kind of boring though we do have a guitar. I've sort of been teaching myself to play it for years now.\" I tried not to sound boastful. \"When we get back I want to hear you play,\" Sean smiled. \"I'm not that good,\" I assured him quickly. \"I bet you are. Promise me you'll let me hear you play,\" urged Sean. \"Fine,\" I snapped. \"You get angry easily,\" he noted after a few seconds. I sighed. \"Sorry.\" \"You don't have to apologize,\" Sean frowned in confusion. \"Well what do you want me to do?\" I demanded, a little perplexed myself. \"Nothing!\" he said. I shook my head exasperation. After a moment, he asked,\"Are you always like this?\" \"Like what?\" \"You know what I mean.\" He seemed to be smiling to himself. \"Do you want to sleep on the ground?\" I offered irritably. To my surprise, his mouth spread into a smile. \"Touché,\" he laughed. I slumped my shoulders and then finally smiled and laughed along with him. \"You two sound like you're getting along,\" Trevor said suddenly from the doorway. \"How long have you been standing there?\" I asked. I didn't like it when people eavesdropped on my conversation. \"About two seconds now,\" he said accurately. \"Do you need a spare toothbrush?\" I asked after a moment's silence. \"Oh, no that's okay,\" he said. \"We're already taking your beds and a night not brushing won't hurt…\" he trailed off because I had already grabbed a spare toothbrush from the bathroom cupboard. \"Thanks,\" he smiled. \"Sean's already brushed his teeth, I'm guessing?\" \"Yep,\" Sean said. \"…alright then,\" he said awkwardly, \"goodnight.\" \"Night,\" we said. \"I'm pretty tired so I'm going to bed,\" I told him. \"Are you sure you don't want your bed?\" Sean and his uncle had an annoying habit of double checking. \"I'm sure. Goodnight,\" I said. He took off his shoes and got into the bed. \"Goodnight, Lydia,\" he replied quietly. I smiled and turned off the light. A/N: Oooohh their relationship's blooming!! hahaha. Anyway I'm sorry if the character is boring to you. It took ages to figure her out and I'm still having trouble with it.[Chapter 3] A/N: Funny story this - I was trying to post this chapter up and when I tried to find the story, IT WASNT IN MY DOCUMENTS. I was very angry and thought I'd lost the rest of the story, when dah dah-dah dah-daaaah... I found it! So here it in Lydia's POV.... even though it will be for the whole story. I was awakened very early by my sister. \"Come on, Lyd. We have to go in half an hour,\" She said. She was all packed and dressed. I moaned. \"Why?\" I mumbled, muffled by the pillow I'd brought for the couch. \"Because it's going to take a while to hike all the way up the mountain and then down again, so get packing.\" We didn't pack last night because one: we always left it last minute and two: we didn't get much time with all the talking and planning. I sighed and slowly got up off the couch. Sean was out of my room, so it was safe to get dressed. I threw on some dark jeans and a three- quarter sleeve white shirt with a short-sleeved t-shirt over that and a big, puffy jacket for extra warmth. I didn't bother putting my hair up – it would be warmer if it were out anyway. I ran a hairbrush through it quickly and then I checked the mirror in the tiny bathroom. I didn't look much like Hannah; she had blue eyes and blonde hair with perfect teeth. Whereas I had light brown hair and blue-green eyes which were surrounded by medium length eyelashes. My teeth weren't the best either - a few were a little crooked but luckily, unnoticeably crooked. I was fairly tall and had a pale complexion. I soon stopped \"admiring\" myself in the mirror and brushed my teeth. I always brushed my teeth for far too long. I've never known why, I just couldn't help it. Hannah always teased me when I'd brushed them for almost a minute and a half and I had a goaty-beard of toothpaste trickling down my chin. When my teeth were cleaned I put my hiking shoes and clomped down to the kitchen where Trevor and Sean sat, Hannah handing them bowls of cereal. I made my own porridge, and then sat on the floor eating it; the two stools were occupied by the boys. \"Hey, Lydia, sit here,\" Sean offered, getting off his chair. Well that was polite. \"No you're the guest,\" I said. \"Everyone packed?\" Hannah asked us. \"Yes,\" I said. I'd packed just before I'd got dressed. The boys grunted a yes and then we left the house. Hannah and I were about ten metres in front of the boys as we walked up the mountain. \"Come on, boys,\" My sister encouraged, \"we need to be home by sundown.\" \"They're gonna take all day,\" I complained at the boys' turtle pace. \"Just keep going,\" Hannah said. \"I think I'll wait for them,\" I decided. She nodded and walked on. The boys soon caught up to where I was standing. They stopped to rest for a minute. Sean stared after my sister. I exhaled and looked up at the sky – something I did when I felt awkward. \"Dibs,\" Sean said. \"What?\" Trevor asked. \"I got dibs on the mountain guide,\" Sean told him. I scoffed and raised my eyebrows. Trevor frowned. \"You're thirteen.\" \"Sorry, called it,\" Sean said. \"Thirteen year olds don't get dibs,\" argued Trevor. \"Get over it!\" Sean yelled over his shoulder. \"He's just trying to stir me up,\" Trevor said more to himself than to me. \"Alright,\" I said, unconvinced and then looked at where Hannah was walking, way ahead of us. \"Hurry up, my sister's waiting. She's impatient; she'll charge you more.\" That made him go faster. We caught up with Hannah and Sean eventually. \"We're getting closer,\" Trevor said. \"Alright just watch your step there; Snaffles can be deceptively treacherous,\" Hannah informed. \"What's Snaffles?\" Sean asked. \"It's the name of the mountain,\" I explained. \"Where in the book, Lyden Brock – the character – apparently found a portal to the center of the earth.\" I shrugged. \"Let's just find that center of the earth first,\" Hannah said. \"Killjoy,\" I accused playfully. \"Hey,\" she said, half-heartedly, laughing. I smiled. This was usually how serious our arguments got. Then we finally reached the top of the mountain. We all huddled around a little machine: a weird pointy thing sticking out of the ground. \"What do you do with it?\" I asked as Trevor took something out of his jacket. \"We gotta unlock it, it has like a black box and it has recordings of all the seismic activities transpired in the last ten years. It'll tell me a lot about Max and what he was doing when he went missing.\" \"Trevor I'm really sorry but we're gonna have to go now,\" Hannah said, looking at the sky. I looked up too. \"Whoa,\" I said, noticing at the black storm clouds rolling in. Trevor paid no attention. \"Trevor we need to –\" Hannah was cut off by a sudden fork of lightning and a rumble of thunder. I looked up again and lightning was flickering madly in the sky and the thunder was rumbling louder. \"Okay, let's take cover.\" Hannah pulled Sean and me into a section of the mountain that looked like it'd had a chunk carved out of it, making a roof for us. \"Come on, Trevor, just leave it alone,\" I called. \"I've almost got it,\" Trevor replied. The storm grew more vicious as Hannah, Sean and I grew more nervous at Trevor's position. \"Trevor, come on. We need to take cover now,\" Hannah called over her shoulder. He still wouldn't give up. \"Uncle Trevor!\" Sean yelled. \"Get in here!\" Trevor finally pulled out the sensor and shouted: \"Yes! Argh!\" A lightning bolt had hit the ground right near where he stood. Then about five more hit as he ran to us with the pointy thing. \"TREVOR DROP THE SENSOR!\" I cried. \"IT'S ATTRACTING THE LIGHTNING!\" Hannah yelled. \"No!\" Trevor said, narrowly dodging what would have been a fierce strike of lightning. \"HURRY UP!\" We all yelled at the same time. Trevor finally gave up and threw it behind him where a bolt struck it and made it explode. Suddenly the lightning struck the rocks above us and the roof gave way. Hundreds of boulders fell to the ground, blocking our escape A/N: Dum dum DUUUUUUM!!!! Sorry it's not very descriptive. Review please or I won't finish the story! Hah! What a threat.[Chapter 4] A/N: That cliffhanger lasted! Here's chapter four. For a while I couldn't see anything. Then it became a bit more clear and I saw dark sillhouttes scattered around the cave. Suddenly I had a coughing fit at all the dust. \"Trevor? Trevor?\" I heard my sister call. She shone the torch around and found him lying in the rocks. She helped him up. \"Lyd? Lydia is that you?\" She asked at my coughing. \"Yep,\" I croaked. \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said between coughs. Carefully, I got up. \"Sean? Sean where are you?\" I turned on my torch and shone it around the area until I found him half sitting near a few boulders. \"Are you alright?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I'm good,\" He grunted. I slowly helped him up and we joined the adults. \"Alright everyone just stays calm,\" Hannah said, shining the torch around. \"Guys, come on! You gotta help me dig!\" Sean said, pulling at the huge rocks. We all clawed (in a figurative phrase) at the boulders for a while but nothing happened - they were too heavy. I shone the torch at Hannah and spoke to her. \"Forget it; it's no use,\" I said. \"Forget it?!\" Sean said. \"Lydia's right; we're under sixty tones of boulders. It'll take us about a month to dig out of here,\" Trevor estimated exasperatedly. \"We're gonna have to find another way,\" I said. \"What if there is no other way?\" Sean asked, truly panicking now. \"There's always another way, Sean,\" Hannah soothed, digging through the backpack. She pulled out some head torches and I pulled out my own from my bag. \"What else have you got in there?\" Trevor asked my sister. \"Signal flares first aid, some rope, blankets, and a couple of protein bars. But we don't want to rush them now; we don't know how long we'll be trapped for.\" \"Trapped? Is that what we are?\" Sean asked frantically, putting the head torch on. \"No, Sean. She didn't mean- what are you doing?\" He asked his nephew, who was pulling out a cell phone, he dialed a number. \"I'm not getting any service!\" He cried. \"You won't get any signal down here,\" I told him; I grabbed the phone and shut it. \"Don't worry, alright? We're gonna find another way out,\" Trevor calmed him. We all shone the torches around. \"There are two openings there- they might lead us back,\" I said, pointing the torch at them. \"How do we know which one to take?\" Sean said, his voice squeaking a little. Trevor thought for a little. \"My gut says we go right.\" He walked toward the gap and we followed. We walked into a little corridor with walls of rock, shining the torches on every part of the walls. \"Ah. This looks promising,\" Trevor said. \"Just keep walking; we'll be out of here in no time.\" I walked next to Sean, tripping over mine and his feet every few seconds; I was a bit of a klutz in the dark. \"Don't worry,\" Trevor continued, \"direction is my sixth sense. See Sean? It's alright. Just like doing fieldwork. I used to love doing fieldwork…\" Suddenly Hannah gasped and screamed: \"WATCH OUT!\" She held him from behind. She then pulled him back and they both panted like dogs. \"You're not studying rocks in the lab, professor. This is life or death here,\" He nodded. \"Okay, thanks,\" She punched him lightly on the shoulder. \"You owe me one.\" Sean and I stepped out from behind. I then saw a shape in the dust. I knelt down and dusted it off and picked up and metal rectangle. The other three noticed what I held. \"What's it say?\" Trevor asked. \"Arkon gabrenna. That means um, keep out,\" I said. Hannah nodded. \"Maybe that's some decent advice,\" Sean said nervously. \"No, no. This could be great news. This could lead us to an old mine shaft which could be our way out,\" Hannah replied, taking her jacket off. I mimicked; it was getting a little stuffy. \"How deep do you think it is?\" asked Sean. \"Hannah, give me one of those flares,\" Trevor said. Hannah unzipped the bag and passed the flare to him. \"Okay Sean. Look at your watch,\" Sean did as he was told, \"I'm gonna drop this flare, and you tell me how many seconds pass before it stops.\" Sean nodded, taking his eyes off mine and onto the watch. Trevor lit the flare. \"Ready? Three, two –\"BOOM! It exploded and we all fell back. Hannah underneath Trevor, and me on top of Sean. We quickly got up, me feeling a bit flustered. \"What was that ?\" I asked. Trevor touched the walls for a moment. \"Magnesium,\" He said, in an as-a-matter-of-factly tone. \"Magnesium is kind of flammable isn't it, professor?\" Hannah asked. He nodded. \"How about this?\" She pulled out a glowstick from my bag and snapped it. \"Thanks,\" He said. \"Okay. Three, two…\" He dropped it. Sean counted slowly. \"Almost three,\" Sean said. \"So that's about… two hundred feet,\" Trevor calculated, \"which is about your basic twenty storey high rise. Got enough rope?\" He asked my sister. \"I always have enough rope,\" She snorted. She unzipped the bag and handed it to him. \"Enough rope for what?\" asked Sean anxiously. \"For going down there,\" I told him. \"We're gonna be going down that deep dark hole?\" Sean asked in disbelief. \"What, do you have a problem with that?\" Trevor asked. Sean scoffed. \"What's the matter?\" \"There's no way we should be repelling down there.\" \"What are you talking about? You're man enough to call dibs on the mountain guide but not man enough to climb down a little piece of rope and –\" \"Guys,\" Hannah cut in, \"no one gets dibs on the mountain guide. We're going down there.\" We all strapped in with rope and harnesses. Trevor, who went first, shuffled his way slowly downward. \"Remember we're all connected,\" My sister reminded. She tightened up Sean's harness and then she and I helped him down. \"Okay Sean. We're gonna start lowering you down,\" She told him. \"Just lean back, and keep your feet up high,\" I advised. He gave a nervous smile at me. The corner of my mouth twitched, which seemed to be a tiny smile back at him. He took a few steps. I nodded in encouragement. Then he awkwardly shuffled down, breathing hard. \"Just keep walking,\" I called. \"Hey, looking pretty good, Sean,\" Trevor said, \"Sure you haven't done this before?\" \"Shut up,\" Sean snapped through gritted teeth. Loose rocks crumbled under his feet, some of them almost hitting his uncle. \"Hey watch it,\" Trevor called. \"I'm hanging off the edge of my life here,\" He yelled. I sighed and quickly slid down next to the struggling boy. \"It's okay, Sean. Just make conversation with me,\" I encouraged. \"Uh… so Lydia, do you come here often?\" He asked feebly. I smiled. \"Is that the best line you can come up with?\" Trevor asked. Sean's cheeks darkened. \"I'm making conversation with her!\" He yelled back. I laughed. \"No, Sean. I don't come here very often,\" I chortled. I felt Hannah coming down not far behind us. We all climbed our way down slowly. \"Hey, looks at all this schist,\" Trevor said, touching the walls. \"What?\" \"Metamorphic rock. Green schist, carnage schist,\" Trevor named the rocks. \"Oh. Schist,\" Sean said. I smiled to myself. \"It's everywhere-look at it! It's- ARGH!\" Suddenly Trevor had slipped and fell, jerking us off the wall and causing us to hang there. We all screamed and searched for something to hold onto. Sean had evidently chosen my hand without realizing. \"Trevor your rope is caught on mine. If we're going to get down I'm going to have to cut you loose,\" Hannah said, reaching around for her pocket knife. \"WHAT?! NO! ARGH!\" Trevor screamed as he fell about five centimeters. Sean and I laughed as we drifted back to the ground, still hand in hand. My eyes flickered to our intertwined fingers and then I cleared my throat and he released my hand. Sean's cheeks seem to darken in colour. \"Hey Hannah you knew the bottom was down here, right?\" Trevor asked. My sister didn't answer. \"Hannah?\" When she still said nothing, I smiled at him patronizingly. \"Of course.\" A/N: Review if you liked![Chapter 5] Sean wandered around, his torch in his hand. \"Hey guys, what's this?\" He asked. His torch was shining on a dusty door looking thing. \"It's the mine. It was shut down sixty years ago because of the big disaster,\" Hannah said, pointing at it with her torch as well. I made my way over to them. \"Disaster? How big?\" Sean asked. \"Eighty-one dead,\" Hannah said. \"That's pretty big,\" Trevor noted. Hannah led the way, Trevor following her and Sean and me next to each other. \"Hey, Trevor was there a mine like this in the book?\" asked Sean as we walked. \"No,\" His uncle replied. \"I don't think so.\" After a while he asked Hannah and I: \"Hey, do you guys wonder if your father and my brother had been right?\" Oh dear - he'd just set Hannah off. \"Let me make something clear to you,\" Hannah said rather coldly, \"We… are not our father. And the world that he belonged to has nothing to do with us.\" Her words were slow and distinct. I got the urge to say something like: \"speaking for yourself there much?\" but didn't. \"Of course, I didn't mean –\" \"You know she's still charging you?\" I asked quickly, trying to Band-Aid the situation. \"You're still billing me?\" Trevor asked in disbelief. \"I bill you until my sister and I are safe in our house.\" I walked away from the bickering adults. Suddenly I saw something in the distance. It looked like a giant cog. I walked toward it. \"Hey what are you doing?\" Sean called behind me. \"Look,\" I said, shining my torch on it. \"It's the old generator for the mine,\" Hannah said, holding one of the handles. \"Hey you don't want to touch that,\" Trevor said quickly. \"I think I do.\" My sister turned on a few switches whilst Trevor protested. Soon enough, lights turned on everywhere. \"Okay I take it back,\" Trevor laughed. I inclined my head and saw lots of little carts on tracks. \"This is it, right?\" Sean said, \"I mean, the miners had to put their stuff somewhere – these tracks could lead us out.\" \"Hey how many miners got out?\" Trevor said. \"Uh, one.\" Hannah said. \"Oh,\" I said shortly. Sean grinned. \"Well that's a start. I call front,\" He ran toward the first cart. \"Hey Sean we don't know if these things work, they're not safe, the track could be unstable –\" Trevor was cut off by my sister wheeling toward Sean's cart. She pushed it into the back of his. \"Track ahead looks good,\" She said cheerfully. \"Get in.\" \"Okay Lydia you'll have to get in with Sean since you won't fit with me,\" Trevor said. \"Alright,\" I said. I could see Sean smiling. I got in and held his waist, as told. \"This isn't funny,\" I said irritably. \"I know,\" he sniggered. \"What?\" I demanded. \"You look terrified.\" \"Do I?\" I said through gritted teeth. Hannah pushed us out and then we were off. We were going fast and I was freaked out. I whimpered and tightened my grip on the boy I barely knew. \"Sean does it look safe?\" Trevor asked from behind us. \"I think I see something,\" He called back. \"Please tell me its daylight otherwise I don't want to know.\" \"Uh – uh it's not daylight I think it's – oh we're in deep schist.\" I braced myself. We were suddenly plummeting down a steep hill. I screamed and held onto Sean so tight I was surprised he could still breathe. Trevor and his nephew screamed with me, holding on tight as they could. \"HOW COME THEY DON'T HAVE SEATBELTS ON THIS THING?\" Sean said. \"YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SEATBELTS?!\" I panicked when I saw the huge gap in the track. \"HANNAH!\" I yelled. \"I KNOW!\" \"PULL THE BRAKE! PULL IT!\" Trevor screamed. \"NO, WE WON'T MAKE IT!\" She replied. \"HOLD ON!\" Sean yelled at me. I tightened my grip even more and then screamed as we flew off the track. We bounced as we suddenly landed back on it. Then the track split into three different trails. \"Hang on guys!\" Trevor shouted as we all zoomed in different directions. I screamed and screamed as we rode down the steep hills and Sean laughed with delight. \"Weeeeee!\" Sean giggled like a little girl. \"Hey, that reminds me of a joke –\" \"Shut up!\" I screeched. We finally pulled up next to Hannah and Trevor who were lying on the ground, breathless. \"That… was… awesome!\" Sean said, getting out. I collapsed into the seat, panting and trying to slow my heart rate. \"What happened to you guys?\" He asked. \"Don't. Ask.\" Trevor said, groaning. I was still trying to stop my head from spinning in the cart. \"Need some help?\" Sean asked, grinning. I didn't say anything so he took my hand and helped me stand up slowly. Then he held my waist and pulled me back down to him. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, dazed. He was suddenly distracted as he looked over his shoulder. He walked towards whatever he was looking at. \"What's that?\" He asked. \"Hey don't go in there,\" Trevor grunted, trying to get up. I slowly followed Sean. He was standing at a small opening. He then went through. I looked at my sister and Trevor who were getting up behind me, and then climbed through as well. We were now in a cave full of gems embedded into the walls. \"Hey guys, check it out,\" He said, touching a large ruby. \"Rubies.\" \"Emeralds,\" I said, pointing at a green gemstone with the torch. \"Feldspar,\" Trevor said. \"Uh, guys? There's more,\" Sean said, shining his torch over at a hundred more diamonds. \"No way,\" I said, picking one up and examining it with my torch. \"Crystals are frequently formed,\" Trevor recited, \"And found in… volcanic tubes!\" \"This tube could take us back up, right?\" I asked him. \"Uh huh,\" He replied. \"We're not far from the surface,\" Hannah said. \"When I get out, I'm getting a mazzerati (?) ,\" Sean said to me as he picked up a diamond. I half-smiled. \"You know money doesn't always matter Sean. People matter too,\" Trevor said distantly. Sean put the diamond in his bag. \"Not if you have mazzerati.\"I heard a small cracking noise. \"Did you guys hear that?\" Sean asked. \"Nobody move,\" Trevor said immediately. I did as I was told. Hannah knelt to the ground very slowly. \"Tell me that's not what I think it is,\" She said. \"Muscovite,\" Trevor squeaked. \"Oh,\" Hannah gasped. \"What's Muscovite?\" Sean asked. \"Muscovite is a very thin type of rock formation,\" Hannah explained. \"How thin?\" Sean asked nervously. \"So thin that the slightest change of weight or pressure can cause it to shatter,\" Trevor said. \"And we're standing on a lot of it.\" \"Well…that's problematic,\" I said, pointing out the obvious in my Icelandic accent. Sean took a slow and balanced step. The cracking noises continued. \"Stop,\" I told him. He did as I said and kept still. \"What should we do?\" I asked my sister. \"Um… okay we need to walk back the way we came very calmly. Heel toe. Lydia, Sean – you go first.\" Sean and I walked very steadily and slowly, heel, toe as told. I slowly helped him put on his backpack. Suddenly, a large diamond fell out and headed for the Muscovite. \"No!\" We all shouted. The diamond fell to the ground, creating a series of cracks in a circle around it. We all held our breath and then sighed when nothing happened. \"It's actually thicker than I thought,\" Trevor said, relieved. CRACK. \"AAAAAAARGGHHHHH!\" We all screamed as fell down into blackness. Then the screaming stopped for a moment. \"WE'RE STILL FALLING!\" And the screaming continued. We all drifted toward each other and then grabbed hands. Sean and Hannah held mine and Trevor held onto Hannah. \"TREVOR WHAT'S AT THE BOTTOM?\" Sean asked as we fell to our death. \"IF VERNE WAS RIGHT THIS HOLE COULD GO FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES.\" \"VERNE WAS NOT RIGHT,\" Hannah protested. \"TREVOR FINISH, WHAT'S AT THE BOTTOM?\" I said. \"IT MOST LIKELY JUST ENDS.\" \"ENDS?! GOT ANY OTHER THEORIES?\" Sean said. \"WELL, THE WALLS OF THIS TUNNEL COULD HAVE ERODED WITH WATER WHICH STILL RUNS PROVIDING A GRADUAL BREAK THROUGH OUR FALL… KIND OF LIKE A WATER SLIDE.\" Trevor yelled. \"WATER SLIDE… OKAY THAT'S A THEORY,\" I said. \"BUT TREVOR THE LEVERAGE OF WATER IS POINTING STRAIGHT UP AT US! WE COULD BE SKEWERED *If that's what she said?* !\" Hannah screamed out. \"THAT IS ALSO POSSIBLE.\" \"AAAAAARRRRGGGHHH!\" We all screamed again. I felt a droplet of water touch my face. I wiped it off with my hand. \"IS THAT WATER?!\" Hannah asked. \"YES, WATER.\" Trevor shouted. Sean then repeated water slide over and over. \"HERE IT COMES! HANG ON!\" We grabbed hands again and braced ourselves. A/N: Lots of shouting. Review![Chapter 6] It turned out that it was like a water slide and the four of us slid down into the deep, cold water. I saw Sean, Trevor and Hannah swimming with the loaded backpacks. I swam toward the closest to me which happened to be Trevor. Just when I thought I was going to run out of oxygen, I pushed my head out of the water. \"We didn't get skewered!\" I said to Trevor as we tread-watered. I swam to the land and collapsed onto the rocks, panting like anything. Soon Sean burst out of the water and we helped him back to land. We all sat, panting. \"Where's... Hannah?\" I asked, noticing she wasn't there. \"Hannah!\" Trevor yelled and then jumped into the water like some life-saver. I huffed, glaring into the water. \"Don't like Trevor?\" Sean guessed breathlessly. \"No, it's just…\" I panted, \"he's acting like he's... meant for my sister or something. He barely knows her and... he thinks he can just come onto her. I know I sound bad with him jumping into the water to save her and all but still...\" \"No, no. Uncle Trevor isn't like that,\" Sean said, \"It's just a little crush,\" he explained. He seemed to look down as he said the last word. \"Okay,\" I said, a little more reassured. \"Are you alright?\" I asked. \"Yep,\" he said, \"you?\" \"Yes.\" Suddenly Trevor burst out of the water with my sister. \"My backpack was too… heavy,\" she panted. We pulled them back onto the rocks and we all lay on our backs, feeling exhausted. Hannah then frowned at the ceiling. \"Are they stars?\" \"No, it's just the cave ceiling,\" Trevor said. \"Is it just me or is the cave ceiling… moving?\" Sean asked. \"Yeah,\" Trevor said, frowning. \"It does look like it, doesn't it?\" His words were slow and a little uncertain. We all slowly stood up, and then in a flurry, the 'stars' started moving down to us. \"They're… birds,\" Sean said. \"Electric birds?\" \"They look like Syannas Rozoptrex. The bio-luminescent. They're like fire flies or glowworms. It's incredible.\" The rest of the flock flew away except for one, which stayed near Sean and me. \"Have you seen these things before?\" I asked Trevor. \"Yeah, in the museum where they were fossilized – these things have been extinct for over a hundred and fifty million years.\" The flocks flew back to us again and then back through a tunnel. We followed them and ended up in a whole other place. It was like an enormous cave with big rays of light shining down. There was a beautiful water fall and the glow birds swarmed around it. Around the water fall there was large rock which we stood on. \"Ladies and gentleman, I give you the center of the earth,\" Trevor murmured as we all stared in amazement. \"Max was right! He was right! Max was RIGHT!\" He yelled in triumph. \"Lydia, your dad was right too,\" Sean said, smiling at me. I smiled back and then glanced at my sister. She didn't look too happy. \"They believed something that everyone told them was impossible. HE WAS RIGHT!\" Trevor shouted shiningly. \"We get it,\" I laughed. \"What's that light up there?\" Sean asked. \"I can't tell. It must be some sort of luminescent gas combination…?\" \"It's like a… terrarium.\" I said as I stared around the magnificent sight. \"Yes, a terrarium under the crust of the earth,\" Trevor agreed in wonder. \"A world within the world.\" We were then exploring the beautiful jungle within the earth, Trevor reading out the description in the book. \"It's exactly the same thing Lyden Brock wrote.\" \"Are you saying that Lyden Brock, the character, was real?\" Hannah asked in skeptically. \"Someone came down here, someone saw all this, someone got out and told Verne,\" Trevor shrugged. \"Someone got out?\" Sean repeated, \"That's the best thing I've heard all day!\" \"Doesn't this completely blow your mind?\" We walked over to some giant poofy dandelions. I blew on them and little fluffy umbrellas drifted away from us. I smiled and giggled to myself. \"My mind is blown, yes,\" Hannah said. We began exploring again, near some huge mushrooms. Sean and I glanced at each other every now and again, and then back to the world we had no idea existed. \"Enormous fossilized mushrooms,\" Trevor said. \"Sorta like humongous fungus?\" Sean asked. I laughed even though it was the worst joke in the world. Trevor showed us the mirror image picture in the book and then our eyes turned to the real mushrooms. \"Does this mean everything in the book is real?\" Hannah asked. \"Probably.\" \"All the really dangerous parts?\" she asked. My stomach dropped. \"I was just thinking about that, too.\" I gulped at Trevor's words. \"Right.\" Something rumbled in the distance. \"Trevor come quick,\" Sean called. \"Sean?\" Hannah, Trevor and I said. We made our way swiftly through the mushroom field and over the Sean. He stood in front of a large twisted tree. He took a few steps toward it and we followed. \"I'm going in,\" He said. \"Yeah, wait up,\" Trevor sounded a little distant. Sean climbed into the tree as Trevor followed. I was a little torn. My sister was behind us and Sean was in the tree. I decided to follow Hannah. \"Hannah?\" She turned around. \"Hannah what's the matter?\" I asked. \"I always thought Dad was crazy… and now… now that I've seen what he was going on about…\" She trailed off. I sat next to her on a log. \"I know, I feel the same. But I know this is kind of overwhelming and frightening, but just try to enjoy it, for now while it's lasting. I mean, how often is it that you get to go to the center of the earth? Trust me, Hannah. It'll be okay.\" She smiled and helped me up. We walked back. \"Look,\" Hannah said, pointing to a cylinder shaped object hanging off a tree branch. We sauntered over to it and wiped off the dust and mud. \"Oh,\" I murmured, looking at the one word written in black pen in capitals: MAX \"Come on,\" Hannah muttered. We walked through the undergrowth for a few minutes, and then I stopped after stepping on a hard something. I knelt down and picked up the gray torch. There was a label on it: M. ANDERSON. \"Oh,\" Hannah said this time. We crawled over the dirt on the ground, and then felt what seemed like an edge. We looked down, and saw a huge, never ending trench. We then shared the same sad expression at the next sight. A/N: *sing song voice* Reviews, reviews, I love reviews! Also feel free to give ideas for the story :)[Chapter 7] A/N: Back with chapter six. Enjoy it! \"Trevor?\" Hannah called. \"Go inside with Sean,\" She whispered to me. I nodded and went into the tree/house. \"Hey,\" He said distantly. \"Hi.\" I could hear the sadness in my voice. \"What's wrong?\" He asked. \"Sean, I'm so sorry,\" I said sympathetically. \"W-what is it?\" He asked. I took his hand, and lead him down the beach. \"Lydia, what?\" I didn't say anything. I lead him to a pile of rocks chucked onto the sand - well, more precisely, Max's body. Hannah and Trevor were there as well. Trevor put his hand on Sean's shoulder. Hannah kissed him on the head. I gave his hand a gentle squeeze. \"I never really… got a chance to know him.\" His voice shook a little, and I could see his brown eyes glistening with tears. \"I mean, I wish I did.\" I got a severely strong urge to hug him, but resisted. \"He wrote something, and I want you to hear it,\" Trevor said, pulling out a little journal. I bit back tears myself. \"August fourteen, 1997. Today was Sean's third birthday. Six weeks ago I promised myself I would be home to give him his first baseball glove. Now I'm worried that I'll never get the chance. I set out to make an incredible discovery to share here with Trevor and the world, but now, I would trade it all just to watch you grow up, to be the brave and certain man I know you will become. Happy birthday, Sean. I love you, Daddy.\" I wept a little as I looked at Sean and a tear ran down his cheek as Trevor sobbed the last word. \"Goodbye, Max.\" Trevor's voice shook now. He gave his nephew a hug as he cried into his uncle's shirt. Hannah embraced me gently as we cried as well. We all soon walked back to the tree house. Sean lay in the hammock, staring up at the ceiling while I stared at the ground. \"According to Max's journal,\" Trevor said, \"We're here. Surrounded by lava –\" \"Well that's comforting,\" I said sarcastically with false brightness. - \"During periods of intense seismic activity.\" There was a rumble and a shake. \"The magma that surrounds us turns into like a big oven.\" \"Is that what happened to my dad?\" Sean asked, sitting up in the hammock. He got out and walked over to the table. \"Look I know we're just kids but Lyd and I can handle this.\" The new nickname caught my attention. I glanced at Sean and then back at the adults. I nodded slowly in agreement. \"Guys,\" Trevor said as we sat down with them. \"Max was planning an escape.\" \"His notes here say that temperatures down here reach up to about two hundred degrees,\" Hannah added. \"A human being can't survive up to about one hundred and thirty-five.\" \"It's already ninety- five degrees.\" Sean held up the thermometer. \"It was eighty-two when we got here – the temperature's rising fast,\" Trevor said. \"So what do we do?\" I asked. \"I saw we follow Max's plan.\" \"Here's what he wrote: my analysis of the original Verne text leads me to believe that across the ocean due north my current position is a geyser- like river which might lead me back up to the surface,\" Hannah said as she showed us the notebook. \"So we just have to get across the ocean, find the geyser and just hitch ride topside?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"Topside sounds good,\" Sean chimed in. \"It's a little trickier than that – it could get so hot down here that all the water could just evaporate,\" Trevor corrected. \"How much time do we have?\" His nephew asked. \"Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two tops.\" Rumble, shudder. \"Probably less,\" He added. \"Okay so the question is: what the fastest way to get across the ocean?\" Hannah asked. They discussed options, and then scratched them again. Sean and I glanced at each other. Then he picked up the book and laid it out for everyone to see. \"It's all in the book.\" A/N: I know it's all word-for-word from the movie but that's because I hadn't watched it in ages so whilst writing I watched it, paused it, and then wrote what was said. If I just tried to remember, I wouldn't because I can't even remember five minutes ago hahaha.[Chapter 8] A/N: Crap! I haven't been doing a disclaimer! OK, I don't own Journey to the Center of the Earth. Just Lydia. \"Ouch,\" I said as a sharp twig dug into my leg. I checked to see if there was any blood. Just a little. I'll be okay, I thought. \"Lyd can you hand me that branch you've got there?\" Hannah asked. I nodded and heaved it up. It scratched my hand deeply this time and I gasped loudly. Sean dropped his branch, and came over to me. \"Go away,\" I muttered to him. \"You hurt yourself,\" he said. \"It's just a scratch.\" I scowled though I was only being rude because I was flustered at how much he seemed to care. I held out my hand. He scoffed. \"You sure?\" He held my wrist and pushed it lightly back to me so I could look at it. It was a deep cut, a jagged line with dark red blood seeping out. I winced and I hid my hand behind my back so he couldn't see it anymore. \"Go get it cleaned up. I got this covered.\" He gestured to my branch which he was now half holding. I frowned. \"You're impossible, aren't you?\" He chuckled. I went over to Hannah. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"I cut myself,\" I told her. I showed her my hand. She winced and then quickly retrieved a small bandage from her backpack and wrapped it around my hand. I went back to Sean to help him with the branch he'd told me to leave. I had to say it kind of weird being in mini shorts and a t-shirt (I'd ditched the jeans because of the heat and retrieved a pair of mini pants that cut off at the middle of my thigh - I still had them in my bag from one time which I couldn't remember and I'd simply stripped off in the treehouse privately, leaving the long-sleeve on the wooden table). I felt really revealed. You could say see through. I lived in Iceland, so I hardly wore summer clothes. Hannah had tied my hair in a braid just before we started building the raft and it was starting to fall out. I was close to just yanking out the hair tie, but I remembered I would regret that in the next heat wave. The raft was almost finished now. Just a couple branches to add, and then, away we go. Sean and I then realized we were ravenous. We ended up having to eat… I actually had no idea what it was, but all I knew, it was putrid. I took one look at it and wrinkled my nose. The smell of it was even worse. I decided I wasn't going to be able to eat a lot the next few hours so I just grit my teeth and ate it. Almost vomiting on the first swallow. Sean gagged as he took a spoonful of it. We eventually got through the whole thing without throwing up, but it was definitely a close call. \"Don't we need to set our mast?\" Sean asked his uncle a while later as we tied last minute knots. \"Nope. Don't need it.\" \"What?\" I asked, confused. \"The wind that we want is way up there,\" Trevor replied, pointing to the sky. \"Thermal. It's a lot faster than what we got down here.\" Sean and I then cut a few loose ends. \"Very good, guys.\" I smiled and began to walk back to Hannah. \"You alright?\" I asked. She nodded. \"You?\" \"Yes.\" It was silent for a moment. \"Are we nearly done?\" I asked. Hannah smiled. \"Yes. We just need the sail and then away we go.\" I smiled too. Sean and Trevor stood at the front of the raft where Hannah and I helped them tie the sail. It shot up as the wind tugged it violently. We all grinned in triumph. Hannah and I stood at the back of the raft and then the wind pulled it off the sand. Trevor and his nephew quickly jumped on and we were already sailing. A/N: Yes! I finally found the image for Lydia. It's what I imagined her to look like. Just make her hair darker and her eyes blue-green and it's perfect! Just go onto my profile and it should be there .[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: Journey to the Center of the Earth - not mine. A/N: Chapter nine! \"It's just a little storm, ain't no big deal!\" Trevor yelled in assurance as the waves chopped, sea water spraying everywhere. It was pouring down rain and the sky was a blackish purple color with the frequent exception of fork- shaped lightening which flashed through the sky, brightening it all up for half a second. The thunder rumbled on and on like a thousand slamming doors. Hannah moved toward the side of the boat, drenched by the freezing rain. \"There's something moving down there!\" \"Probably just plankton! Same thing we saw back at the beach!\" Trevor replied in a bellow. Sean leaned over one side. \"I don't know it looks kinda big for plankton!\" \"Sean, we're not at Sea World, so just back up a little!\" ordered Trevor. \"I think it's some sort of fish!\" yelled Sean, shaking out his hair. He suddenly jumped back. I then saw the reason for his sudden movement and yelled out in fright. It was a huge fish. Silvery with giant, wide translucent eyes and teeth like knives. It had leapt out at Sean and when he jumped out of the way it went straight for Trevor. He wrestled with it until he finally kicked it off. Soon fish everywhere were jumping out of the water, trying to take a chunk out of us. \"They're everywhere!\" Sean yelled. \"Sean I told you we'd get to the batting cage!\" Trevor shouted back, pulling out two large sticks. They then whacked every fish that leapt out at us, smashing them right out to sea. I noticed one headed for Sean. Instinctively, I picked up a stick and whacked it. Hannah mimicked, and we were all whacking fish away from each other. Then I heard something beeping… a phone? \"Do you hear something?\" Hannah asked. Sean pulled a cell phone out of his pocket. \"Hello? Mom? Mom, I can't hear you...uh, Uncle Trevor and I are… sorta on a…a fishing trip… and uh…uh…uhm…\" I followed his gaze and scowled when it was at my sister's butt. I then did a double take and saw a huge fish, mouth gaping open at Hannah's behind. Before I could do anything, Trevor had picked it up and whacked it. \"Uh… Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one… and…\" All of a sudden, a fish had leapt out and caught it with its mouth. \"My phone!\" \"Sean?\" I said, pointing to the massive thing moving behind him. \"I got it – Argh!\" An enormous snake-like thing had burst out of the water and jumped onto the raft. Its jaws snapped at Sean. Wait, no. The fish at his feet. It snagged it and crept back into the sea. Soon enough there was more of them. \"Look! They don't want us they want the fish!\" Trevor yelled us we huddled together in the center of the raft. \"Sean, Lydia you take the tailor, we'll take the front. Hannah, hold the slack!\" He bellowed. Sean and I went to the back while the two adults were at the front. Trevor then told us something not either of us understood. \"What?\" We said together. \"THAT WAY!\" We turned the rudder, and we started going left. \"Now, Hannah, just let it out gently, gently.\" He said to Hannah, who held the rope. \"It's working!\" I shouted, grinning. \"You're the man, uncle Trev!\" \"That's what I've been trying to tell the scientific community for years!\" Sean and I laughed but then quickly stopped as the sail was jerked forward. Hannah suddenly fell back. \"Hannah!\" Trevor yelled, coming to the back of the boat where my sister lay. \"Are you okay?\" I yelled to her but I didn't think she'd heard me. She yelped as Trevor pulled her back to her feet. I got a glimpse of her bleeding hands and winced. Trevor continued to help the struggling woman as Sean and I ran toward the front to catch the sail. We pulled and pulled at the sail. Both of us screamed \"NO!\" when it snapped off. We were jerked up. \"SEAN! LYDIA!\" The adults yelled out our names. \"TREVOR! HANNAH!\" We called back. \"NO!\" Hannah yelled. \"LYDIA!\" \"HANG ON! DON'T LET GO!\" Trevor cried out to us. A/N: The kids are in deep schist now! (using a cheesy pun) Review please.[Chapter 10] A/N: I'm sorry, I know it's been a month since I've updated but I've been busy. I had heaps of school work to finish and was busy with my other stories. I was supposed to update on the weekend, but my aunty came back from England, and we stayed with my relatives until Sunday afternoon. The rest of the time I just couldn't be bothered to get on fanfiction and copy and paste a few things (I wrote this story a few months ago and it's all written and finished) I'll stop boring you with excuses now. Disclaimer: JCE isn't mine... shame, that because I sure would like to have Josh Hutcherson :) --- I'd just woken up and immediately remembered our little scenario. I started to get up, but then gasped and fell back down. I looked at my leg. Down my calf was a huge gash with blood trickling out of it. How'd that happen? I'd been unconscious for god knows how long. I crawled around in the sand. \"Sean?\" I yelled every now and again. I suddenly slipped and my bleeding leg smacked onto the sand. I let out a gasp of agony. I looked at my leg. Luckily, only a few grains of sand were stuck in it. I blew it off and then very slowly got up. \"Sean?\" I yelled out once again. I limped slowly up and down the beach. Soon I went into the rain forest-like area behind the shore. I walked around, looking for nothing in particular. My leg was really searing, but I was trying to ignore it. Suddenly I tripped over a massive and seemingly invisible tree root. I cried out in pain as I fell onto my back. I wheezed, shut my eyes and tried to be my breath back. I was winded. It was a terrifying feeling, not being able to breathe. Eventually I regained oxygen but didn't bother getting up. My back hurt too much. The forest floor was a little muddy but was covered with leaves. Fresh dew drops hung off the trees and dropped gently onto my face every now and then. I just lay on the ground, moaning with my eyes shut. \"Lydia?\" I heard someone call. My eyes snapped open. It was Sean. \"Lyd?\" He yelled. \"SEAN!\" I yelled back. \"Lyd? Lydia is that you?\" \"Yes!\" I cried, happier than ever. I heard his footsteps speed up. It sounded like he was jogging in my direction. Soon a sweaty, bloody, dirt-covered Sean Anderson was standing above me. He beamed when he saw me and I returned it. Then his smile faded a little. \"What have you done to yourself?\" He frowned, looking at my leg. \"Oh. Um, I don't know,\" I answered honestly. He chuckled and stepped closer to me. All of a sudden his arm was around my waist and had gently pulled my own arm around his shoulder. Sean helped me limp out of the undergrowth. \"You never stop, do you?\" I muttered. \"Nope,\" he laughed. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"Don't mention it. I'm so glad I found you. I was beginning to think you were dead or something. That really would have sucked. I'd really miss –\" He suddenly stopped talking and his cheeks flushed and his brown eyes flickered toward the ground, as though he'd said too much. \"You'd miss me?\" I finished. \"Yeah,\" He mumbled. \"Well I'd miss you too,\" I admitted. \"Are you thirsty?\" He asked after a moment's silence. \"Yes.\" He took me over a large wall made out of rock with water streaming off it. I cupped my hands and gulped the water. \"Thank you,\" I said again. \"Really, you've been very good to me. I owe you.\" He smiled. His eyes then trailed over to my leg. I took some water and splashed it on there. Some of the blood washed off, but not much. I went to open my backpack, but then realized I'd given it to Hannah. Suddenly Sean started ripping the bottom of his shirt. \"Hey, what are you doing? No, don't do that –\" I protested. \"Shut up,\" Sean said, holding the piece of material. \"I could've used my own shirt,\" I pointed out. \"Too late,\" Sean said as he slowly wrapped it around my leg. \"I can do this myself, you know,\" I stated as his hands wound round my calf. \"Too late,\" he repeated simply. He seemed to take forever with the bandaging. Maybe because he was trying to be gentle. \"Thanks again,\" I said. Sean helped me stand up and then he took a quick look around. \"Okay, let's go.\" A/N: Sean's so lovely :) I hate the fact he's not real -_- Review.[Chapter 11] A/N: Hello to the probably 8 people who have given up on this story. I am very very very very, times a hundred very, sorry. I started another story, and this one wasn't doing all that well so hence my abandonement. But I have good news! This chapter is fairly long, so you won't be as annoyed. I know I get angry when a person who hasn't updated since I was born finally posts a chapter, and it's an author's note or a five second chapter. Anyway enjoy the long awaited chapter. Disclaimer: This belongs to that guy who wrote the book and the people who made the movie (I really know my stuff today) We slowly stood up and Sean took out his compass. \"South,\" he read, \"that's good. The river's North.\" Just then, the glowing bird had twittered and flew over to us. It then zoomed off into a huge cave. We quickly followed it, even with my limp. It took us to an enormous landscape with rocky ground. We walked across it hand in sweaty hand. Suddenly Sean tripped. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. He said nothing. He seemed to be staring at something. My eyes suddenly widened when I saw his pocket knife floating in mid-air. I reached out and pulled it back. After helping him up, I handed it to him. He let go of it for a few seconds, experimenting, and then pulled it back again. \"I get it,\" he said slowly. \"It's a magnetic field.\" Then we started jogging across the rocky land, me limping along, trying to catch up with him. Suddenly he stepped on the ground and it disappeared from underneath him. We stared down at the never ending glow of blue. Our heads then slowly looked up. My jaw dropped. Ahead of us there was giant rocks floating in mid air like stepping stones all leading to a strange light on the other side. \"No way,\" I said. \"Magnetic rocks?\" We took a few steps closer and looked down. I think both of us nearly fainted. \"No,\" I said instantly. \"It's the only way we can get to the river,\" Sean murmured. \"If you want, I'll go first.\" I considered it, but then thought about the floating rocks. \"No. Once you go across they might not join up again the same way.\" \"Okay, we'll go together,\" He decided. \"I'll go in front, you follow.\" I nodded very slowly. He turned to face the rocks, his hand still in mine. Then Sean turned back to me. \"Um, in case, I die,\" He squeaked, and my stomach did a backflip. \"I have something I want to tell you.\" \"Hurry up,\" I said hoarsely, wanting to get across the death rocks as quick as possible. He took a breath. Then the words he wanted to say tumbled out of his mouth very quickly. \"Lydia I think you're really pretty and funny and smart and… kind of weird, but then again, that's a contributing factor–and I really, really like you. If you die, I won't be able to forgive myself because it will probably be all my fault.\" I was about to open my mouth to say it wouldn't be his fault, but he had stepped closer to me and kissed me on the lips. My brain still clicking into place, processing what had just happened, I put two fingers to my mouth where his lips had touched it and smiled. \"Well,\" Sean said rather formally, \"now that that's all cleared up…\" he nodded once and turned back to the deathly field of suspended rocks. He let go of my hand, and then jumped. My heart was pounding; I was expecting him to fall to his death. He made it. He spoke then, but didn't turn back to me. \"After I jump onto the next one, you start jumping.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a terrified whisper. He leapt onto the next rock. I took a deep breath, and jumped. I had built up a scream for when I fell, but I didn't need it. I had jumped successfully. Sean bounded onto another smaller rock, and then stepped onto a bigger one. His foot slipped, and he fell over. I screamed. \"It's okay,\" He called. We watched as the wedge of rock he'd pushed off slowly floated back up to its original spot. I followed him with a butterfly infested stomach and a dry mouth. Sean jumped onto his hands and knees onto another, and the rock glided closer to others. It hit the other rocks and I winced at the impact. I realized I was wasting time and quickly made my way closer to Sean. Then I noticed after he had hit the other rocks, he had floated back closer to me. He was on his hands and knees, almost. I slowly lay down onto my stomach, and gripped the rock's edges with my life. The other stones crashed into mine, but I didn't go too far back. I stood up and leapt onto two more rocks. I saw Sean's path empty of other stones, and fretted. Then gradually, another rock glided in front of Sean. He jumped onto it. He was on his hands and knees again. Then I gasped in horror as the rock began somersaulting backward. \"No!\" We yelled. He clutched onto it extremely tightly as the rock turned annoyingly slowly. His head torch fell out of his pocket as it flipped him upside down. I let my rock float closer to his, and then jumped onto the one behind Sean's. His rock did a full three-sixty turn. \"Yes!\" He said when the rock was still again. \"No!\" shouted Sean as it flipped forward this time. He gripped on the rock again, until it was the right way up. Soon he reached the end. He got off the rock. \"Come on, Lydia,\" He encouraged. I nodded and jumped. After two more leaps, I climbed onto another one, and my foot slipped. I screamed and I had something of a heart attack. Once I was breathing normally again, I jumped, but this time, I missed the middle of the rock. I grabbed onto the edge, and the rock turned toward me. I screamed just before I fell. \"NOOOO!\" Sean roared. I fell down into the endless floor, still screaming. Nothing really ran through my mind as I had my last moments, just how loud the wind was in my eardrums, which meant I was falling quickly. My hair whipped my face. I had kind of gotten used to falling by now, so I shut my eyes and tried to imagine I was flying. It didn't exactly work as I'd planned. Suddenly something slammed against my shoulder blades. \"OW!\" I yelled. \"Lydia?\" Sean called hopefully. I couldn't reply – I was a little preoccupied with the throbbing in my shoulders, head and back. Suddenly I realized I wasn't descending anymore. I was rising. A rock below me must have floated to me just in time. I cried out in happiness and then I felt the rock hit the ledge of the other side, and then Sean pulled me off the rock. I wrapped my arms around him, sobbing a little with him. \"I thought you were dead,\" Sean said as we hugged. \"Me too,\" I admitted. \"I'm never doing that again,\" I vowed as tears slid down my face. Realizing how little time we had, we let go of each other. Sean and I then walked into a narrow entrance to another huge patch of land. Not knowing what to expect, we looked around warily, and jumped at our own footsteps. \"Hannah?\" I called hopelessly. \"Uncle Trevor?\" Sean asked. We kept walking, now over mounds of earth. Sean checked his compass. \"Still south,\" he muttered, putting it away. We walked for a few minutes when we came to a large mound of earth. Sean jumped off the mound, and then helped me down because my bad leg was weak. We turned around and gasped at the \"mound\" we'd jumped off. It was no hill. It was a skull, a dinosaur's skull. \"Man,\" Sean said, \"I really wish I read that book.\" A/N: So there it is :) Tell me what you thought in the reviews.

Okay, Guys, I know there isn't a bridge to go to Lily's house, okay! But if there wasn't a bridge in this fic, the fic wouldn't exist. So don't flame the bridge. It needs to be there! And besides, what did it ever do to you? Jeez. Just let the bridge be. Or not be, since it doesn't actually exist, but lets not go into that, okay? Good.[Chapter 3] The rain was sloshing out of the sky harder and harder, and night was closing in. Robin found torches for them all to use, and they combed the zoo backwards and forwards, yelling against the wind. \"Dyl!\" \"Dylan?\" \"Dylan!\" Benjamin put Rosie to bed and started to panic. It was 8 o'clock. It was dark outside and Dylan had been gone for hours. \"Kelly, I think we should call Search and Rescue. Or the Police. Or something\" She opened her mouth to assure him that Dylan was fine, then closed it in defeat. Benjamin was right. \"Okay. I'll call\" \"Thank you\" When the few emergency personnel that the city could spare came, they paired up with one of the zoo staff each. They widened the search area, to the river, the driveway, the neighbours property. And then someone found him. Washed up on the banks of the river, caught in a fallen tree, he looked like some more river debris. But as more men the fluorescent rain coats worked to bring him out, Benjamin saw his face. Small and pale. Eye's closed. Nothing like the boy who gad drawn Spar in his prime. The boy who loved pizza. Who's eyes followed Lily everywhere. His son. Alone and small in that mass of fluro men. Now they lifted him out, dripping and limp. Strapped him to a stretcher. Called for and Ambulance to meet them. Grabbed oxygen masks and yelled things about vital signs and heart rate. Carried him off into the rain. Alone. His son. His Goddamn son. And they held back when he tried to follow. Wouldn't let him hold Dylan's hand. Not even that. The made him leave. So he left. He left his son. All the while hoping, praying, begging that Dylan knew he didn't want to. Hoping that he knew he would come back. That he would be there. That he wouldn't let him go. *A/N Awwwww… poor Benjamin. And poor Dylan. It's a little bit of a cliff hanger and I'm sorry, but I just can't write fast enough for my brain. And I'm half asleep. Sorry Love, Scooter[Chapter 4] The hospital was cold. But hospitals always seem to be cold. He supposed that people who were at hospital had more on their minds than the temperature. But he couldn't focus on the things in his mind. So he focused on the other things. The temperature. The different colours of the nurse's uniforms as they squeaked past him, sparing no glance for the man alone on the blue plastic chair. Doctors came in and out too; writing on clipboards, shadowed by people listening to their every word. Which he supposed they had to. Surely the things the doctors said were important. Especially in places like this. \"Mr Mee?\" He looked up. This Doctor was short. Short and surprisingly female. He supposed that was sexist, but he couldn't help himself. He had to think about her as a person, about her gender, her hair colour, anything. Just not about what she may say. \"Mr Mee?\" \"Sorry, yes?\" \"My name is Dr Lucas. Are you Dylan's father\" \"Yes\" Yes, he was his Father. His Father. And Dylan was his son. So much in a little word. So much to understand, so much that people rarely appreciated what it truly meant. Son. Father. Family. It all meant so much. \"Well, Mr Mee, can you spare a moment for me?\" Like he had anything better to do. \"My office is right this way\" Inside, there were photos of another man. Taller, much taller. Useful when kissing. He tried to not think that. Inappropriate thoughts while your son is in hospital, Benjamin. He supposed it was a coping mechanism. A bad one, but still, the operative word was coping. He could cope. \"Now, Mr Mee, by the looks of it, your son was underwater for a long time. He inhaled a lot of water, but he is breathing fairly normally now. The next few days are crucial, because of the inhaled water, so we are keeping a close eye on him\" \"Secondary drowning\" \"Yes, yes\" She sounded surprised \"I'm sorry, are you a Doctor?\" \"No.\" \"Oh. Well, apart from that, he has a broken leg, a bad cut on his arm, and quite a bad knock to his head, so he probably has concussion. Whether its any more than that remains to be seen\" \"Okay. Okay\" He remembered to breath. That was an important thing to do. Top priority Benjamin. Breathe. Dylan is going to be okay. Right? \"But is he going to be okay?\" She sighed. Probably got that question a lot. He dreaded the answer. \"I hope so, Mr Mee, I hope so\" \"Can I see him?\" \"Certainly! Just this way\" Dylan was in intensive care. But that was okay. They were just keeping a close watch on him, just in case. That was what she said. Dylan would be alright. The door to his room was blue. No window in it, presumably there weren't many windows to the rooms in this part of the hospital. Privacy, and all that. God, he hated hospitals. Dr Lucas opened the door. The light was off, and she turned it on after him \"He's still asleep\" And he was. Asleep on his back (which he never did). Benjamin felt something inside him melt into a puddle as he stared at his son. So small against the white and blue covers, frowning in his sleep, head turned to one side, machines beeping quietly alongside him. But nothing could hurt him now, because Daddy was here. Daddy's here now Dyl. You'll be alright. My love will keep you safe. I promise. *A/N For Anonymous – Thank you so much for reviewing! You made my day. This next bit is kind of a spoiler but no, Dylan will NOT die! Nogat tru! I don't think I could possibly write that. I'm the kind of person who has to rewrite movies in my head if the characters that I like die; otherwise I just can't live with myself. It makes me too sad. For Crazy Person – no it's not real. In the movie its just like; la di da di dee I love you! Yah! And that's it. (well, no, that's not really what it's like, but oh well) The rest of you, review! You have to feed the beast within me, or else she won't come out to play! Oh wow, that sounded weird. Lets move on. Sheesh.[Chapter 5] Dylan was dreaming. At least, he thought he was dreaming. Somewhere, he could feel his Dad holding his hand. He didn't know how he knew it was his Dad, especially because his Dad had never held his hand before, but it was him. He could feel his fingers griping on tightly, as he floated in a sea of grey liquid. Vaguely, he thought that he should be drowning, because he wasn't breathing, and his body was submerged. But he was breathing, he could see the bubbles. They floated around him, and gushed out of his mouth. He could hear a beep in the distance, slow and steady. It was calming, like listening to a clock ticking. Because of it, he knew that somewhere things were happening. It was only him in this sea of grey. He was glad that no one else had to be here. Rosie would probably be scared. He hated it when she was scared. But wait, why would she be scared? Nothing bad had happened had it? He couldn't remember. Why couldn't he remember? He tried to think about what had just happened. He was outside. He knew that. Outside, and then Lily. Something about Lily. Something that made him run towards her house. What for? Oh. To tell her that he loved her. Well, that was true. So why was he here? What happened after he ran? He couldn't remember. He was just running and running, and then something happened and all he could remember was the water. Water. Everywhere. Why is there so much water? Dad? Rosie? Lily? Anyone? But there was no one there. Only water. Everywhere. Grey, and stretching on and on into the distance. It seemed to tighten on his chest, and suddenly felt thicker. The bubbles stopped. He couldn't breathe. The water was crushing him, squeezing him tight. Drowning. That was what this was called. Drowning. He was drowning. He felt the fingers that held his tighten, and words rushed hazily past him. The beeping got louder, and the words got faster and faster. Dad? The fingers that held his, loosened, and then there were more touches, people trying to get him out. But he couldn't swim. The water was too heavy and he was sinking faster. They tried to stop him, but he was drowning. Drowning. Down Down Down. The water turned from grey to black and then it wasn't water any more, it was blood. Blood everywhere. He felt it in the back of his throat, and shut his eyes tightly. No matter how much he thrashed, he just kept sinking. And the blood water got thicker and thicker. Wasn't there a saying about that? About blood being thick? He couldn't remember it. Dad? Please? Dad? I need you. And then the fingers that held his were back and he heard someone whisper in his ear \"I've got you Dylan\" Dad? \"I'm here. You can come out. You can wake up. I'm holding on to you. And I won't let you go\" I'm sinking Dad \"I won't let you go, Dyl. I promise.\" Okay. And he woke up. And he was floating again, and his Dad was floating too, holding his hand and smiling. * A/N Sorry for the wait everyone! I had to go down to the big city so we could buy my sister a wedding dress and bridesmaid's dresses for me and my other sister. Whew! I tell you, I started dreaming about wedding dresses! I kid you not. It was horrific. Anywho, I did finally manage to get this up – even though, after I got home, there was an EARTHQUAKE! and my lamp smashed. :-( Don't worry, the next chapter will include Awake Dylan, and I have a really cute conversation between him and his Dad ready. Be prepared for fluff! As always, Review please! To all you Anonymous reviewers (who by the way can't spell anonymous right) thank you so much for your reviews. After a very stressful few days, you made my week! And yes, Lily, Rosie, Kelly, and everyone else know that Dylan is in hospital. Why wouldn't they? Love from Scooter ; - )[Chapter 6] *A/N I realised that I don't have a disclaimer for this story so by the way, I don't own We Bought a Zoo or any of the characters and I am gaining no profit or any form of financial gain from this (which is sad). The only thing I own is the bridge. But since it doesn't actually exist, I don't own that either. : ( Benjamin held Dylan's hand tightly. He had been coming in and out of consciousness the whole day, and he shifted underneath the blankets, and mumbled underneath his breath. Benjamin leaned forward. \"Dyl?\" He didn't respond and Benjamin sighed and leant back. Doctor Lucas had assured him that Dylan would wake up soon, in fact, had told him it would probably be today. But after the scare in the morning, she had just side stepped all his questions, and told him that Dylan would be fine. Of course he would be fine. He would make sure of it. He just wanted Dylan to wake up. To stop looking so small against the covers, and to stop trying to move, before wincing in his sleep, because he hurt too much. He wanted him to wake up and squeeze his hand and say something. Anything. And then Benjamin would say I love you. Just so Dylan knew, and would never forget. Just like Benjamin would never forget the way Dylan's face looked when he smiled, just like he would never forget his voice, or his laugh, or his cry. And just like he would never forget the way he thrashed against his sheets this morning, or the way the nurses yelled for Doctors, or the way the monitors surrounding him beeped and flashed widely, begging for attention. Or the way, his son's hand tightened on his when he whispered in his ear and told him everything was going to be alright. He sighed, and shifted in his seat. Then straightened up. Was it his imagination, or had Dylan's hand moved? Tightened? \"Dylan?\" Yes. This time he definitely moved. \"Dyl?\" His hands twitched against Benjamin's fingers, and his eyelids fluttered. \"Dad?\" \"Dyl?\" \"Hurts.\" \"Where?\" Surreptitiously, he pressed the call button. Dylan tried to open his eyes, and unconsciously groaned. Benjamin held his hand tighter \"Hey, hey, it's alright. It's okay. Can you tell me where it hurts? Dyl?\" He shook his head, and Benjamin pressed his hand against his cheek \"Okay. It's alright. It's alright. Just stay still, kay? Everything's going to be fine.\" Doctor Lucas came in, clipboard in hand, pen behind her ear. \"Hey. Nurse's said that you called?\" He nodded \"He's awake\" She dropped the clipboard. She was probably expecting him to want to order a coffee or something. Not happening today. She opened the door and yelled down the corridor. \"Simon! Get in here, and bring Lucy!\" She shut it again and took the pen out from behind her ear \"Dylan? Can you hear me?\" His head moved slightly, and he winced. \"Okay. Squeeze your Dad's hand for yes, okay?\" He squeezed and Benjamin nodded at her. The door opened again and two nurses rushed in, more clipboards in their hands. Someone should make saying about that. An army marches on its stomach, and a hospital runs on clipboards. Clipboards and pens and hands free blue-tooth headsets. Definitely. The male nurse went around the other side of the bed, and beeped buttons on some machines. He looked like he was doing something important. Probably was. The female nurse stood behind Doctor Lucas as she crouched down next to Dylan. \"Hey, Dylan, my name's Doctor Lucas. Can you open your eyes for me?\" His eyelids opened a slit, and he squinted at the light. She wrote on her clipboard and smiled at him. \"Well done. Now, Dylan, is the light hurting your eyes?\" He squeezed Benjamin's hand and he turned to her. \"He said yes\" \"Okay\" She wrote more on her clipboard. \"Good. Now, Dylan can you remember what happened?\" He shifted in his bed. \"No. Just water\" His voice was scratchy, and he coughed. Benjamin noticed his chest rising and falling quickly, and rubbed his thumb across his hand, in a gesture of it's alright. Dylan smiled at him, and his breathing slowed down. Doctor Lucas noticed that too, and the way he kept his eyes closed against the lights in his room. She wrote on the clipboard again, and rose. \"Thank you Dylan. One more question, are you tired?\" He nodded and she nodded as well, as though she was expecting that. \"Okay. One squeeze for tired but okay, two squeezes for I just want to go to sleep so can you go away\" Benjamin smiled, and felt Dylan's squeezes. \"Two\" \"Okay\" She wrote some more, then tucked the pen behind her ear again. \"Thank you Dylan. Mr Mee, can I speak to you in my office?\" *A/N OOOHHHH CLIFFHANGER! Ha! I'm evil. And I won't write anymore, because I have decided to make a VOTE You guys need to review and tell me where you want to go with this fic. Should Dylan be alright, and fine, and after a couple of days in hospital, go home and be happy and start drawing sunflowers on his bedroom walls? (If anyone chooses that, I'll be really surprised) Or should he be MORTALLY WOUNDED (sorry, there's the geek in me) and have to be kept in hospital and have lots of machines and there will be crying and swearing and other angst, fluff and a hurt Dylan? Or should it be more mental, and he'll be scared of water, or bridges, or storms, or something? (that one would actually be quite cute, I can see it already) Or a combination? Or a different one that comes from YOUR brain and is equally delightful? Or none, and should I crawl back to my room and never come out? Hopefully not the last one. BUT SERIOUSLY GUYS THIS IS A SERIOUS VOTE/POLL/ THING! It is really a cunning ploy for you guys to review. If you don't review and also tell me what you want, I won't write anymore. So there. So this means you have to review! Because I wrote that last chapter and this one while earthquake shook the computer and my cat got scared by them she started chewing on my leg. And I got no reviews! : (apart from one – which I thank Anonymous for) So review! Now! Also, thank you to GemmaHPJ for following and favouriting this story! Everyone else, that's how you do it! Thanks Gemma. Apart from my twin, you are my new favourite person! Hehe ; ) PS: Thanks to anonymous for the spell check! I changed it now! ;-)[Chapter 7] (If I owned this movie, I wouldn't have to write fan fiction about it, because all of this would be in the movie. So there.) *A/N I did it guys! Finally! Special thanks to StripedFuzzySocks who inspired me! (I don't know why, her review just did) More thanks, apologies and me at the bottom of the page! Doctor Lucas was silent. She chipped away at her nail polish, refusing to look at him, leaving him to stew in her sticky blue chair. He could see her thinking about what she was going to say. How she was going to break the news. He didn't know what the news was, but god damn it, he knew there was news. He knew, knew to the very core of his fearful, fearful heat that something was wrong. And she was sitting there rehearsing. Benjamin had never been good at following scripts. Plans. Staying within the boundaries. Keeping to the careful little social protocols that humanity invented for itself when it all became too much. He hated them. Hated tip toeing around the subject because it was awkward. Impolite. Private. So he broke the rules. Interrupted people. Said what needed to be said, when it needed to be said, to whoever needed to hear it. But he'd never been as scared of doing it as he was now. \"What's wrong?\" She stopped chipping, and looked up. \"Sorry?\" \"What's wrong?\" She opened and closed her mouth uncertainly. He could tell she wanted to continue. To pretend that she didn't understand, gain more time, think of ways to be gentle. Ways to make it all seem all right. But he refused to play that game. Stared right back at her, looked into her eyes and forced her to spit whole thing out. (A/N Did you know that I almost failed my Social Sciences test, because I used the word 'force'? Isn't that stupid? Right, you're reading. Sorry) \"Well Mr Mee, our original diagnosis seems to be correct\" \"Concussion?\" \"Yes. But we need to take a few scans to double check some things. Probably as soon as possi –\" He interrupted impatiently. \"Can you just say it straight to my face?!\" She looked uncertain, but his eyes told her not to sugar coat anything. \"By the looks of it, it's quite a bad concussion.\" She started listing things off on her fingers \"Sensitivity to light, tired all the time, having trouble remembering what happened… We need to at least do a CT scan, to check that there's no bleeding or internal damage. Ism sorry Mr Mee.\" He nodded at her and stood up. \"Well, you start getting all that ready; and I'll be waiting in Dylan's room.\" The door shut behind him with a finality that scared him, and he almost ran down the corridor. Inside Dylan's room, someone had turned off the light. Dylan was still lying on his back, and the machinery beside him still glowed and beeped softly. Benjamin squeezed his hand gently as he sat down in another blue chair by the side of the bed. And as he sat there, all he could think of were all of the times he'd ignored him. Told him off. Yelled at him. Every single time that he had done anything that hurt Dylan. And as he sat there, he wondered if it was all his fault. Of course he knew that nothing he had ever done could have caused this. He'd seen enough bereavement pamphlets in doctor's offices and read enough children's books to Rosie to know that. But he sure as hell knew that it wasn't Dylan's fault. And he was the only one left to blame. A hand touched his shoulder lightly, and then shook him. \"Mr Mee? Mr Mee?\" The lights had been turned on, and the door was open. Dr Lucas stood over him, holding another clipboard. \"We're just taking Dylan now, to have the scan\" He blinked hard. Stupid body. Always falling asleep at inopportune moments. \"Right, right\" He got up and looked down at her. Hmm. A bit of re-growth in there. She turned and led him down the hall. Dylan was half awake, and he winced as the bed jolted. When he saw Benjamin he smiled and tried to pretend that he hadn't. Benjamin smiled back, and pretended he hadn't seen. The room were they stopped had warning signs stuck all over it, like a kid had gone crazy with a sticker book. Warning, Magnetic Field in Action Authorised Personal only. The actual scanner looked like some kind of torture device, and Benjamin tried not to look nervous as they manoeuvred Dylan onto it. Doctor Lucas turned to shut the door on him, and he managed to catch one last glimpse of Dylan as he was strapped to the bed. He caught his eye, and managed to smile. You'll be alright, Dyl. Don't worry. *A/N Well, there we go! Finally! I'm sorry this took so long everyone, but I was away and then I actually ended up in hospital (which had really expensive WiFi by the way). You would think that actually being in a hospital would have helped, but this chapter was actually really hard to write. And when I finally did finish it, we went over our Internet data-cap! Arghhh. Thanks to everyone who reviewed, you are awesome! Anonymous, You were the first reviewer, so you are double awesome! Crazy Person, I thought I made that clear, it's when Dylan thought he was drowning. He like, had a nightmare or something, and stuff. If you know what I mean. I can't really explain it. ; P Story Ideas, Oopps, he wasn't underwater for hours! I know that people can't survive that. Fan, Me too! I love Benjamin and Dylan as a Father and Son thingie! If I was a dude, I would wish my Dad was like this! Overlord, Ummm, sorry, but that's not going to happen. Thanks for telling me though! Anonymous, Awww! Thanks so much! Mrr, Okeydokey. Anonymous, Don't worry, most of that will happen! Maybe a tiny bit of the last one, but not much sorry, StripedFuzzySocks. All you non anonymous reviewers, I replied privately otherwise there would have been too many sorry. Enjoy![Chapter 8] (Still don't own it) *A/N Two chapters in one day! I think this is just me being guilty for taking so long on the last one. It is quite short, but I felt like I needed to include Rosie, and how she must feel. Oh well. Enjoy! Rosie was always good. After all, Daddy was usually nice. And she didn't really like being bad. It gave her a funny feeling inside. Being good was much more fun. You could laugh with your Daddy, and your teachers liked you, and you had lots of friends. She supposed that was why Dylan was sad lots. He was bad lots, so Daddy never laughed with him, and his teachers all thought there was something wrong with him. And his friends weren't very nice to him. But he was only bad because he thought that was how he was meant to be. She knew that he really wasn't bad. After all, he liked Lily, and she was nice. And when he was good, and happy, he was really nice. He just hid it. She didn't know why. It seemed a silly thing to do, but Dylan was silly a lot of the time. Daddy said it was because he didn't think, but Rosie thought that was just how he was. Maybe that was why he fell in the river. Cause he was being silly. But she didn't think so. It didn't seem like a silly thing to do. No one would do that on purpose. And if he was just being silly, then Kelly wouldn't look so upset, and Lily wouldn't have cried. Daddy had cried too. Rosie had never seen him cry for real before. Not even when Dylan got expelled, or when he said he hated Daddy. That scared her. If none of those things had made Daddy cry, then it must be something really bad this time. But no one would tell her. They said everything was fine, and not to worry. But Daddy wasn't there to tuck her in, and tickle her if she made a joke. And Dylan wasn't there to smile at her if he thought Daddy wasn't looking. And that night she couldn't get to sleep. She tried reading a bed time story, and singing a bed time song. But no one was there to do it with her. And she couldn't do it by herself. And she couldn't catch Mommy's spirit without them either. *A/N Awwwww… She's so cute! Woohoo! Anonymous! First reviewer! And it only took you, like, a few hours! Amazing! All you others, you got two for the price of one. Lucky you And you should all know that there isn't going to be much Lily in this fic. Mostly because, well, *coughs* I just don't like her! And it's not just because she gets Dylan and I don't! I just don't like her. It might be the actor, it might be her personality, I don't know! I just don't like her, so I don't write her, because when I do, she well, well she turns into a bitch. Or acts like she's 7. So there will be no DylanxLily. Sorry Wait. What do you even call that? Lilan? Dyly? Ha.[Chapter 9] (Ha! I see you there, behind the neighbour's magnolia tree! Stop stalking me! I don't own We Bought A Zoo ! And if I did, I would have my security on you!) *A/N StripedFuzzySocks - you are absolutely amazing. I DID IT! WOOHOO! Grade III concussion was what they called it. He didn't know how they decided, but he had read enough Wikipedia to know that it was the worst grade. To be fair, they had tried to explain it to him. And they probably knew more than Wikipedia. But it was all a bit of a blur and he couldn't remember what they had said. Vaguely, in a small corner of his mind, he figured that it was probably night. That same corner of his mind informed him that he was tired, but he told it to shut up and let him get on with doing what he needed to do. Things he needed to do like hold Dylan's hand, and whisper in his ear. Whispering anything, everything. Just as long as he knew that Daddy was here. Dylan was staying in Intensive Care. Benjamin's hard blue chair had been upgraded to a squeaky black recliner that he could sleep on. The lights stayed off, and the curtains stayed closed. And Dylan kept his eyes shut, hardly even acknowledging his presence. Doctor Lucas said it was because of all the meds. He wasn't really aware of his surroundings. She said he probably felt like he was sleeping. Just out of it. Of course, she also told him to talk to Dylan because he could probably hear him. Goddamn conflicting messages. When Katherine had been in hospital he couldn't remember it being this hard. It had never hurt this much to see her lying asleep in one of these flat, white beds. But maybe that was because whenever she had been in hospital, he had known that there was nothing he could have done. Now, now he wasn't so sure. He had fought with Dylan, yelled at him, never listened to him, and maybe if he had, Dylan wouldn't be lying there looking so damn small. As he stared at his son, the hand that he held tightly squeezed back. Squeezed. Yes, it definitely squeezed. Not his imagination, not wishful thinking, it squeezed back. And again. Benjamin leant forward. \"Dyl?\" He squeezed again, and gradually opened his eyes. \"Dad?\" \"Yeah. It's Dad.\" \"Hey\" Benjamin almost cried. His voice was croaky, and his eyes squinty, but to Benjamin, Dylan had never looked more beautiful. \"How are you feeling?\" He grunted, and gave him a look. \"That bad, huh?\" \"No\" \"No?\" \"I can't feel a thing. I think I'm high. Is that clock green?\" Benjamin laughed. \"Yeah. Fluorescent.\" \"Okay.\" He shut his eyes again, and Benjamin contented himself with rubbing his hand. Up and down, and up and down. Comfort, in such a small routine as up and down. His eyes opened again. \"River?\" \"What?\" \"Was I in the river?\" \"Yeah\" Was it just Benjamin, or did he shiver slightly? And was it just him, or did his face pale and his hand tighten? \"Dyl? What's wrong?\" \"Daddy, I'm scared\" His voice was small, and he partially curled over onto his side. He kept his eyes closed, and Benjamin could see his little 5 year old son in his face, hugging a bleeding knee and crying on the concrete. \"Oh Dyl\" He got off the chair, and sat down on the bed, with his arm around Dylan's shoulders. \"It's all right to be scared. It was scary. But you are brave and you don't have to be scared of anything\" \"But I am scared. Not brave\" You are brave. It's just that you've forgotten for a wee while. Don't worry, soon you'll remember again. For now, I'll be brave enough for both of us.\" \"Can you?\" \"I can\" *A/N He. Like how I incorporated Wikipedia into there? Yeah. I know Dylan seemed a little random in this chapter, but trust me, when you're high on morphine and all the other shit that they pump in you at hospitals, you do tend to make comments about clocks and start saying Daddy. True story. Thank you to StripedFuzzySocks for her help; I have now copy-pasted that onto a word document that is constantly open on my computer. ; ) Thanks to everyone else who reviewed as well, you rock! Also, what do you think about the pace of this story? Too fast? Too slow? Love from Scooter[Chapter 10] (Alright, alright, you guys guessed. I actually do own We Bought A Zoo. I've been tricking you all along. My name is Geoff, too. How did you know?) He managed to stay awake for another 5 hours. After that, he did fall asleep, but only because they put some sedative in his IV. Now, every thing was slightly fuzzy around the edges, but Dylan didn't mind. In fact, it was quite nice. Things were less sharp and they hurt less. And the fuzziness wasn't complete. He lay in his bed with his eyes half closed, pretending to be asleep. People kept coming in and out and poking him, talking to him and pressing buttons on machines. Dad had gone to get Rosie. Hopefully to also get a coffee. He looked more tired than Dylan felt. The hugging was nice though. Unusual, but much nicer than normal. It gave Dylan a different kind of fuzziness. One inside. Which sounded cheesy, and he would never admit it, but it was true. He must have drifted off, because someone was shaking him and when he opened his eyes, the room was darker than before. It was Dad. Rosie was behind him, and he blinked several times to wake up. \"Hey Rose\" She smiled. \"Oh, hi! I was scared that you wouldn't say hi to me, 'coz Daddy said that you mightn't, but y'did\" He laughed. \"Yeah, I did\" She jumped up on the bed, next to his legs, and looked at him seriously. \"Dylan, are you hurt really bad?\" He shook his head. \"No. I'm fine, Rose\" \"You're not going to die like Mommy?\" He wrapped his arms around the top of her shoulders and squeezed. \"Of course I'm not\" 'Good. I'm glad\" \"Well, I'm glad too!\" She laughed and snuggled into his chest. His arm throbbed, but he ignored it and pressed his check against her head. Dad sat down in the chair next to the bed, and Rosie smiled at the both, and then closed her eyes. Then she fell asleep. And he was in a really awkward position. Which kind of hurt. Oh well. Dad laughed at his expression, and he shifted slightly under her weight. That was better. Dad leaned forward. 'So? How are you feeling?\" \"Fine\" \"Really?\" He looked sceptically, but Dylan nodded. \"Yeah. Really. I fell just like normal.\" He nodded. \"Dad?\" \"Yeah?\" \"What's the date?\" \"It's the seventh\" \"The seventh? Seven seven?\" \"Yeah\" \"Why the hell are you here?!\" \"Because you're in hospital\" \"What about opening day?\" \"Kelly said she would take care of it\" Dylan opened his mouth to protest, but the door opened, and Doctor Lucas smiled in at them. Dad nodded at her, and she stepped inside. \"Hello, Dylan\" \"Hey.\" \"Now, I've been receiving reports from your nurses, and they are all really happy with your performance!\" \"Okaay…\" \"And we were all wondering, would you like to walk?\" He sat up. Rosie half fell of the bed, and woke up abruptly. He noticed, but all of his focus was on Dr Lucas. \"Are you kidding? Of course I would!\" She smiled, and he turned to Dad before anyone could say anything. \"And that is really good timing, because I can stay here and do walking and stuff, and Dad can go open the zoo\" \"Dyl…\" \"Dad, I am not open to negotiation on this one\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Sure. Go open the zoo, Dad\" \"Okay.\" He left with Rosie on his shoulders, waving behind him. Dylan yelled after them. \"Say hi to Kelly for me!\" Dad gave him a thumbs up in acknowledgement, and then there were nurses in is room, and oh God, he was going to walk. He wriggled to edge of the bed. Ignoring the hand the nurse offered him, he stood up slowly. His legs shook, but he was standing. The nurse smiled. \"Good, Dylan. Just take it easy. We'll just do a few steps, okay?\" Dylan nodded. She slipped his arm over her shoulder. \"Just in case. Now, left foot first\" One step. Wow, that felt good. You never knew how great walking was, until you spent too much time without doing it. Then his right foot. Two steps. He didn't wait for her to say anything, just took a third. And a forth. Without knowing it, his face slipped into a grin. Damn! Double double double damn! What was that? 6 damns? The nurse laughed at his expression. \"Feels good, huh?\" He nodded hard, and she laughed again. \"Awesome. I'm going to let go, and you can go by yourself! Just walk around the room okay?\" \"Okay!\" She let go, and he walked around his bed. It felt like forever, but he got there eventually. She clapped. \"Nice! I'll go see if your Dad is back.\" He stopped her at the door. \"Um, can I… Can I, well…\" \"What?\" \"Can I go piss?\" There was a bathroom that led of this room. He had seen in when Dad had gone in, with big white lettering on the door. She laughed again. \"Sure. If you need, there's a rail in there that you can hold on to\" She left, and he opened the door cautiously. Inside, he peed, and that was another thing so good to finally do. There was no mirror, and secretly Dylan was glad. He could feel where his face was bruised and swollen, and he figured it probably looked worse than it felt. By the sink, he cleared his throat as he turned the tap on. Water sloshed out, and he froze. Something in his mind flinched away from the sound, and he turned the tap off again. His hands were shaking. Why were they shaking? Stop it, Dylan, stop it. His legs felt shaky again, as well, and he grabbed the rail behind him, as he slid down the wall. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't, he couldn't. Why was it so hard to breathe? Breathe, Dylan, breathe. His chest hurt, and it was hot in here. But it wasn't hot, because just before he had been cold. Hadn't he? No. No, it must be hot. It was hot, and he was tired and he hadn't walked for ages, that was all. Eventually, he breathed in, long and shaky. In, out. In, out. Easy. In and out. Breathing. He could do that. He could. It was simple. Someone pounded on the door. \"Dylan? Dyl?\" It was Dad. \"Dyl!\" He got up. \"Sorry, sorry, I'm coming\" He heard the relief clear in Dad's voice. \"Oh, okay\" He unlocked the door, and smiled at his Dad, like there was nothing wrong at all. And there wasn't Nope. He smiled, and Dad smiled, and doctors smiled and said he could probably go home tomorrow. He said he was looking forward to it, and Dad smiled again. He didn't wash his hands. (Seriously though guys, I don't own it. Don't sue me) *A/N That's right! Ha, you all thought he was going to be fine now! And looked what happened! I'm brilliant! There is so much foreshadowing in his chapter, I almost cried! (Okay, not really) And, stop it. I swear none of you are reviewing. I know this because I looked at the traffic stats. Yeah, that's right, it's official, there are statistics. Bam. There is one viewer from Sweden, one from Hong Kong, one from Indonesian, one from Belgium, one from Italy, one from the UAE, and heaps from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, and the USA. And how many reviews do I get? For eight chapters? 33. Now I'm depressed. So review! And in that review that you are totally going to write now, tell me whose POV the next chapter should be in, kay? (Even though this story is kind of in 2 nd person, but you know what I mean)[Chapter 11] A/N This is so fucking hard to write Before they let Dylan go home, he had to talk to everyone. People with blue uniforms, people with pink ones, and some just wearing normal clothes They all wanted to know if he was 'okay'. Of course he was okay. There was nothing wrong with him. Daddy had promised her. And after all, now he was coming out of the hospital, so of course he was okay. Sometimes, grown ups were really stupid. They talked to Daddy as well. And he came out with a frown resting on his forehead, and a worried glance at Dylan. Though Daddy had always had a habit of looking at Dylan like that. Cause Dylan was always worrying everyone. She didn't know what they told him, but soon it didn't matter because Dylan was in the car, and now he was wearing his own clothes, and Dad played music she could sing along to. They were going home. And Dylan was coming with them Inside his room, they had put everything away. The tiny space was clean, and she had put presents all over his bed. There was a chocolate bar, a pencil, an Easter egg, and lots of the little baby bunches of flowers, that she picked herself (though maybe Kelly helped a little) When he went in she noticed that he was frowning, but she supposed that he must be wondering who had done it all. Daddy said it was a surprise, but he was in there now, so she was sure she could tell him. \"It was me! Do you like it?\" He almost fell over his bed, and she giggled. She must have been really sneaky and quiet without noticing, and he hadn't heard her. \"Jesus Rose!\" \"You're not meant to say that in front of me\" He looked guilty, but she shrugged \"But its okay, because you say it all the time anyway, and Dad is being nice to you, so he probably won't mind\" He nodded, and she bowled on \"I did it ALL! Do you like it? Do you?\" He laughed and shooed her out \"I love it Rose. You should do it as your job\" \"When I'm grown up?\" \"When you're grown up\" \"Cool!\" She bounced up and down at the thought. That would be cool! And if it was her job, she would get paid, and then she would be able to buy a ballerina skirt. She wanted a purple one. \"Do you think I could get one?\" But Dylan's door was shut already, and he didn't hear her. She hoped he was okay. He didn't look like he was okay, cause his face was different. But Daddy could look after him. Right? Downstairs, Daddy was trying to make dinner. Not lasagne, just some weird reheated food Kelly had bought. Rosie had thought it was animal food, but Daddy said it was for them. \"Dad?\" \"Yeah?\" He stopped stirring to look at her \"I don't think Dylan wants dinner\" \"Why not?\" \"He's in his room\" He nodded. \"He must be tired, that's all Rose\" \"Still?\" \"He was very sick, so he needs to rest lots before he gets better\" \"But he will get better\" \"Of course! He'll be fine\" He said it so hard, like he was wishing, that she wondered if it was true, but even if it wasn't, she would help him get better. Maybe when she grew up she should be a nurse. *Break* Later, when Benjamin went into Dylan's room, he was curled up under all of the bed covers. Benjamin kissed him on the forehead and left, closing the door behind him. But he wasn't asleep He was too scared to fall asleep. He didn't know why, it was childish and stupid, but he couldn't. It wasn't because he was scared of sleeping or anything. And anyway, he wasn't scared of anything. That would be stupid. He just obviously wasn't used to sleeping in his own bed. Yeah that was it. He curled up harder, and squeezed his eyes so tight that when he finally did fall asleep (cause he did, of course, he was fine) they hurt to open in the morning. But he did fall asleep, and he ate breakfast in the morning, and he was fine. But, later still, Dad asked him to go get Kelly from the barn, and then Then Shit. *A/N Cliff hanger! Thanks to heymitchie for generally being an awesome person, but Lily? Yeah no. Crazy person – you're back! Yay! Thanks for reviewing StripedFuzySocks thanks as always Anonymous here is Rosie for you[Chapter 12] Still not mine, sadly It was raining. That wasn't a big deal; there had just been a storm. But in the house, it just sounded like tapping on the roof. Outside, the front yard was a pool of mud and leaves, and the water was everywhere. It bounced off his hair, his hands, and soaked through his t-shirt. Wet. So fucking wet. He couldn't remember what he was meant to be doing. And it was so cold out here, as though the rain was frozen. But it wasn't frozen, cause it was wet, and he could feel it dripping. Dripping Sliding down Cold against his skin Wet There was a bucket in his hands. For Kelly? Then it was on the ground, And he was on the ground Curled up, trying trying to get away from all that goddamn wet. He couldn't breath, and it was too cold and Dad Dad Dad! Distantly, time passed. Someone was shaking him, then picking him up, and shaking harder \"Dylan? Dylan!\" They shook him again. He tried to shrug out of their grip, but he couldn't, cause he couldn't breathe, and moving was too hard. Breathe Breathe Breathe Shit, he couldn't \"Dylan? Dylan can you hear me?\" They picked him up more, and wrapped their arms around him, tight and strong. \"Just breathe Dylan, just breathe. Breathe\" They didn't understand that he couldn't. He tried, oh God he tried, but it hurt it hurt. And it was so wet, and the wet the wet the wet He was shaking His chest was tight, and as he tried to breathe, everything seemed to hurt, and oh, he was shaking so hard, and \"Breathe! Breathe, shit shit shit\" He didn't know who it was. And he wished he did, cause their arms were strong, and for once he felt like something was holding him together against the world. They were holding him Holding him, and he couldn't feel the rain anymore, and the wet was gone. Gone. Dry He took a shaky breath. Breathe. He could breathe. Another breath. \"Dylan? Hey, you're alright. You're alright\" He was alright. He could believe it, when someone else told him. That he was going to be fine. All right. Normal. Another breath. The shaking almost stopped, but he couldn't open his eyes. No. \"Dylan?\" Too hard. Too hard. \"Look at me, Dyl. Come on\" Someone whimpered, then he realised that it was him. The shaking almost started again, but he clenched his fists and kept them tight. Peaked out from behind his eyelids, and stared at the lines of red made by his fingernails against soft skin. They held him here, lines fastening him to the ground. Red and stark, solid. More solid than the rain sliding down his legs. More solid than the pain in his chest, where the memory of no breath lies. More solid than the way his arms were shaking, no matter how hard he tried. But not as solid as the way arms were wrapped around him, as they picked him up and carried him into the house, where more arms held him and squeezed him and held him tight. That was a kind of solid that made him feel whole again. Away from the rain and the wet and the hurt. Whole and Loved and Safe and Alright. *A/N So yeah. Well, I had a panic attack at school today, so I wrote this off that. And it was pretty shit. Who do you think the person is? I'll give you a hint…. It's a guy. Thanks to Anonymous. Ben will be along soon, don't worry StripedFuzySocks you make me feel awesome. Thanks so much ; ) Also, follow me on twitter! I'm StripyAlice[Chapter 13] *A/N I'm back! Anonymous people, I'm sorry for not being able to tell you I was going away, but I did. So I couldn't update this, but now I can! Here it is! He fell asleep. Though, really, Benjamin had no idea if he was asleep, or passed out, or still awake. Robin said he was probably asleep, cause he must be exhausted. And Benjamin tried to pretend that Robin was an expert, and that he knew. Because then he could pretend that someone here knew all about it, and they could help, and do the right things. He really didn't want to take Dylan to the hospital. He probably needed to. But he would wait. He'd wait until Dylan woke up and talked – said something, anything. And then, maybe he would take him. Maybe. After all, maybe Dylan would be fine. It was a small maybe, but Benjamin held onto it as tight as he could let himself, as he watched his son sleep. *break* Truthfully speaking, Robin was scared. And he had no idea what he was doing. All he knew that Dylan was scared too. Of what, he didn't really know, but he figured he would find out. And he knew that Benjamin was scared too. Of losing his son. Of having to watch his son be scared, and lost. Of not being able to do anything about it. Come to think about it, Benjamin was scared of a lot of things. And he knew that everyone else was scared. Rosie, and Kelly, and Lily, and McCready. All of them. And all of them kept looking at him, like he was meant to know. Know what to do, when to do it, and how to make things all right again. He knew animals. And how to make them better. Why did they expect him to be able to fix this? All this human stuff, that hurt people, and was complicated, and long, and didn't really make sense. How the hell was he meant to understand it, if they couldn't? And how was he meant to fix all of this? He had tried to. He had found Dylan alone in the cold, and he'd held him tight as he could, and he had tried to make it all right. But it hadn't worked. Everything was still messed up and hard, and how the hell was that meant to change? How the hell was he meant to change that? *break* He woke up. Daddy didn't notice, cause he was in the kitchen, trying to hide, cause he was crying. He always hid when he cried, but he never seemed to notice than she saw him every time. He wasn't very good at hiding. She could hear the crying from up the stairs, and when Dylan woke up, she could tell he could hear it too. His face did that thing it always did when he was trying to hide something, and he rolled over again. Rosie supposed that meant he knew why Daddy was crying. She couldn't figure it out, same as she couldn't figure out why Dylan was sleeping now, in the middle of the day, or why everyone had been so upset yesterday. She knew it was bad, anyway, and she knew that something was wrong with Dylan. Cause Daddy had promised her in the hospital that he was fine, but she figured that maybe he was crying because he was wrong, and Dylan wasn't fine. He didn't look fine. He looked tired. He looked like he was a about to cry. Which made her feel sad too. Cause then everyone would be crying. Cause they were all so sad. And they wouldn't tell her why. Maybe they didn't even know why *A/N IT WAS ROBIN! Ooooohhhhh… Sorry, I write him really bad. I just really think he is such a cool character, and no else seems to care about him. And my favourite WBAZ fic has Robin as a main character, so I felt he needed some time in the spotlight here. Randomly, the above fic is called 'Is he Real?' and it's by I Have a Paper Heart . Look at this, free advertising! Thanks to Anonymous for your two reviews! You guys are going to make me have a big head, telling me I'm amazing all the time! Thanks so much, hun. StripedFuzySocks you are amazing too. And so helpful, and always right when I need it! Thanks a million times! The hazel-eyed bookworm I updated! And I'm sorry about that storm. Bad timing, oopps! (Also, its hydrophobic ; ) ) Crazy Person I'm so glad you like it. It's nice to know that people do.[Chapter 14] He called the hospital, That didn't mean he wanted to, but he did. And he was shouted at by 2 doctors, 3 psychologists and 1 irate nurse. Which, quite frankly, pissed him off. Dylan wouldn't talk to anyone. They drove there in silence, and once they were parked outside, he opened the door got out, slammed it and went inside without a word to Benjamin. Duncan was in the backseat with Rosie, and he gave him a warning look, before following Dyl. Benjamin sighed, and took Rosie inside after them. It wasn't Dr Lucas. It was some old, balding, man, who didn't introduce himself. He just walked them to his office, sat them down and started talking like he owned them. Dylan was staring out the window and really, Benjamin wasn't listening either. Rosie and Dunc were outside in the corridor. Benjamin wished he was too. \"Mr Mee\" \"Mr Mee\" \"Yes?\" He looked irritated, or maybe that was just the natural shape of his face. \"I was asking you about the state of Dylan's mental health. Please try and pay attention!\" Benjamin silently apologised to Katherine, if she was listening, and everyone else that he knew. Then he yelled. Quite loudly. For quite a long time. And then there were nurses, and managers, and people with pieces of official looking paper, and then – finally – there was a different doctor. Who introduced herself, as 'Dr Fitz' \"Short for Fitzgerald, but that's too long for me\" She led them to an office as well, but inside she gave Rosie a lollipop to eat while she was waiting, and dug a box of toys out from a cupboard. Dylan sat down and stared out the window. Today the sky was blue, and inside, Benjamin thanked the heavens (and whoever or whatever resided in them) that there was no chance of rain. If it happened again, he was afraid he would scream. He couldn't deal with Dylan looking that small and alone again. He felt like he'd seen it too many times. Benjamin waited in the corridor, after she had finished explaining stuff to him. Again, he really wasn't sure what stuff she was explaining, and he thought now was probably a good time to start listening to what doctors say. She talked to Dylan for a long time. Or at least what felt like a long time. A really long time. When the door opened, Benjamin almost fell over himself getting up and Dr Fitz smiled at him. \"Come on in Mr Mee\" Dylan gave him a smile as he walked in. It was a half hearted, pretend, pretty pathetic smile, but it was a smile. And that was good. Dr Fitz sat behind her desk again, and folded her hands. \"Right so, I've reviewed Dylan's file and given him a few basic tests.\" Benjamin noticed that he had started to involuntarily scratch his arm. \"From the sounds of it Dylan experienced a quite severe panic attack, brought on by the rain, and the memories his recent experience. It has apparently not been the first, and it will definitely not be the last\" Her voice was loud in his ears, but the actual meaning of her words seemed to disappear into a dark space just before his eyes. No. Not Dylan. No. \"He did have a very traumatic experience and the doctors were expecting something of this nature, just not this late.\" They were expecting it. They were expecting it? And no one told him? \"Basically what we're looking at is getting Dylan a therapist, getting him back to school eventually and just generally trying to help him get back to normal. If the situation demands, we can put him on medication; Anti-depressants, anti-hallucinogenics, anxiety meds, whatever he needs.\" Benjamin could already see the mini pharmacy that they would have every day. He could see the amount of empty packets in the rubbish bin and he knew exactly what it would feel like. He'd watched this before. Goddamnit not Dylan. Not again. Next it would be Rosie. Or Kelly. Or Duncan. Please stop. Please. She was still smiling at them. Involuntarily, Benjamin felt a surge of love for this short, bossy women, who seemed to be found of green. He hoped she found a husband or wife. He hoped she had kids, 4 of them, so there would always be someone to look after her. He hoped that she stayed a doctor, stayed here, a rose among a group of bald, arrogant male thorns. He knew she would be happy. He knew she would make others happy, or at least content for a while. He just wished that they could be happy too. That she could make them happy, make things okay again. He placed too much hope in these doctors. In their pills and their monitors, but also in their smiles, and their promises. He knew that he needed to stop. He knew he needed to become cynical again, and understand that things weren't going to be okay. But when he looked at Dr Fitz, smiling at the two strangers sitting in her office, and at Dylan, still staring at his feet, because looking out the window felt too hopeful, he couldn't help but think that it was him who had to make things okay again. Him. Now. And when he stared at his son, and heard his daughter playing behind him, he knew that he would try. And he knew that it would work. It would. It would happen, the same way everything else had happened, with a scary certainty, only this time it wouldn't be scary. It would be fine. *A/N Alright that was so damn hard, you don't even know. But I did it. Got zero reviews but I did it. Yah for me, right? Yeah. Right. And I spelt hallucinogenics wrong but oh well, kill me.[Chapter 15] *A/N Shit happened, and I was in hospital. By the time they got home, Dylan was asleep, and Rosie was nodding off. And to be perfectly honest, Duncan didn't look too far off either. He woke up when the car stopped, gave Benjamin a sheepish smile, and tried to pretend he had been awake as he took Rosie inside. Benjamin carried Dylan in. Automatically, just like when he was little, Dyl wrapped his arms around Benjamin's neck, and his check pressed up against Benjamin's neck. His skin was cool, and his hair tickled, soft, just like all those years ago, when he'd had to do this all the time. Benjamin hurt. Hurt so much just from loving this boy so much. It was almost impossible to describe it, to understand the ache he felt inside. He didn't really understand it himself. It just hurt. Hurt because of the way his son – his son – held himself against him. Because of the instinctive tightening of his fingers, as though that could keep him safe. Father. Son. Those were the words that made this hurt that Benjamin felt inside. Those were the words that meant so much, the words he wanted to hear repeated over and over again. Father. Son. Benjamin. Dylan. His son, who was so small, and who looked so scared and who he had worked so hard to keep safe all these years, but who in the end, he had failed. Essentially. All he had ever wanted, all he had ever needed was to keep him safe. And just like Katherine, he'd failed at this too. He tucked Dyl into bed, sheet up around his chin, and stroked his hair in the dark. With these shadows, he could almost fool himself into thinking he was a boy again, 7 or 8, and Katherine was alive, and downstairs waiting for him with her smile and her long brown legs and eyes that he flew in. But these shadows were lies, and that was all gone now. It was much easier without the shadows, without that unquenchable hope. Dyl's hair was Katherine's hair. His eyes were Katherine's. And so were his words, and his fingers. Dylan stirred. \"Dad?\" He was awake. \"Yeah?\" \"Do you think she's happy?\" Mum. Another word that meant so much. \"She is most definitely happy, Dyl\" \"Cause she doesn't hurt anymore does she?\" \"No, Dyl, she doesn't\" He nodded and settled down again. Then he opened his eyes \"Does she still love us?\" \"Of course she still loves us! She always will, same as we will always love her\" \"No matter what happens with Kelly?\" \"Dylan!\" He laughed \"Come on Dad\" \"Alright, no matter what happens with Kelly. Or Lily\" This time he blushed and looked away. Benjamin smiled. God, he loved him. But Dylan still looked concerned. \"What if she, I don't know, finds some hot angel dude?\" \"Well, I don't think angels are allowed to do that kind of thing\" \"Dad. Obviously. But what if she doesn't want us anymore?\" He sat up, and squeezed Dylan's hand. \"Dyl, she will always love you. She is your mother, and that means more than anything else ever will.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise\" Dylan loved Dad. Sure he did. But he also hated him, when he pretended everything was okay and tried so goddamn hard to make things the same again. He needed to stop hoping. He needed to start understanding the way it was not going to be okay. He needed to start getting over it. But right now, Dylan was glad he looked that hopeful, glad that Dad had all the optimism for both of them. Then he could pretend he was optimistic too, and sometimes, he even fooled himself.

Since you'll ask again… no!\" She yelled back atnme, stirring her hot cocoa. Inslumped down in the chair and pouted. My light black hair wasncovering my quivering lip and wisped over my bright blue eyes. Thenthing is; I got all my facial features from my dad, John Carver. Myndad was well respected in his line of work, but he was a high classnsnob; according to my mom. He had the blackest hair ever, almost jetnblack, and the brightest blue eyes. At least, that's what my momntold me he looked like. He worked as a judge; he was doing a murderncase on some guy, named Bobby Brown, when my mother walks in as anwitness. Afternmy dad saw her, it was like love at first sight. He talked to herneveryday and she finally got involved with him, in both a physical,nif you know what I mean, and emotional way. Then they started goingnon dates, having sex; you know the usual thing men and women do whennthey're together for 6 months. Then my mom found out she wasnpregnant; he wanted a baby boy, but of course 9 and a half monthsnlater, I popped out, and boy did he get pissed. He told my mother tongive me up to an adoption agency and when my mother said 'no' he gotnmad and ran off to the local bar. Afternhe had a few drinks,nhe wanted to drive home. A mile up the road from the bar, his greenncar was swerving. A trunk headed at 70 M.P.H up the same road,ncrashed into the truck making my father's car get crushed and the Wal-Mart truck flip over and set on fire. \"Alexis;nI only want the best for you sweet heart.\" She said to me, shenstroked my hand that was on the coffee table. I looked at her hand onntop of mine and took it back. Turning my hands into clenched fists, Inslammed them on the table, making my mom's coffee cup shake. \"Yournprotecting me… by not letting me see my grandfather's grave!?\"nI screamed at her, frustrated. Then there was a knock on the door, mynmother sighed and got up. \"Waitnhere.\" She said to me and went to answer the door. \"LikenI have any where else to go.\" I snorted and got out my PSP, mynbeanie slipped down and I heard the door creek louder and footsteps.nMy mom stuck her head into the kitchen. \"Wenhave visitors, be on your best behavior.\" She said to mensmiling, shenknows I won't ,nI thought and smirked to myself, shutting off my PSP while slippingnit into my back pocket. Standing up, I walked into the family room. \"Andnthere's my little girl.\" I groaned slightly, knowing better thannto talk back when my mom was already pissed off. \"Hi,\"nI yawned and gave a little wave. \"Shenseems energetic.\" A manly voice replied to my small 'hi'. Insnapped my eyes open and looked at the man; he had black hair andnbrown eyes, kind of muscular. I snorted and looked at my mom. \"Yournnew boy-toy mom?\" she stiffened slightly. \"No!nThey came to ask about your grand father…\" She said, her wholenface was flushed. I laughed a bit and looked at the younger boy. Henwas around my age, maybe a couple months older. He had brown hair andnbrown eyes, in conclusion… he was extremely gorgeous; wearing anwhite t-shirt that covered his baggy, plain brown cargo pants. Intuned into the conversation my mother was having with the older man. \"Infound this in my late-brother's box…\" He said handing her anbook, not any book; my favorite book. \"So?\" \"So,nlook at all the notes…\" she flipped through a couple of pagesnand stopped on one particular… \"Wait...?\"nShe said, her eyes widening. She got up, slowly, going over to myngrandfather's book collection and getting his copy of 'Journey to thenCenter of the Earth'. She opened to the same page; it was the samenpicture and notes. The guy looked confused. \"Takenme up to the volcano tube, where my brother's machine is.\" Henordered. \"Fine;n2,000 dollars.\" \"Anday, no problem.\" Trevor smiled, cockily. \"Annhour…\" My mother corrected him. His eyes widened and stared atnher. \"Yournkidding right?\" \"Nope.\"nWow, my mom's blunt. Hensighed and then the younger boy spoke, \"Will you take rolls ofnquarters?\" Inhad to giggle at that, that was pretty funny. The younger boy lookednat me and I shut up faster than you can say 'pumpkin pie.' \"That'snfine. Whatever you can pay me with… I just need money.\" Thenolder man chuckled slightly and held out his hand. \"I'mnTrevor by the way and this is my nephew Sean.\" My mom shook hisnhand and smiled at Sean. \"Hello,nI'm Hannah and this is, my daughter, Alexis.\" My mom smilednbrightly and took me by the shoulder and patted it. \"Hey.\"nSean said to me. \"Hey,\"nI replied, smiling slightly. \"Youncan sleep in Alexis's bed; Alexis sleep on the couch and Trevor takenmy bed; I'll take the chairs…\" Trevornstarted to open his mouth but my mom beat him to it. \"NOnBUTS!\" Trevor shut his mouth just like I did before and smilednlightly. \"Alright.\"nMy mom smiled again and pushed me towards Sean. \"Shownthis nice boy, Sean, to your room and I'll show Trevor mine.\" Ingrumbled casually and walked towards my room, the last door on thenright. \"Herenis my room, it's not the best, but it's also not the worst roomnin the world. Night,\" I said curtly and started to walk away, butnSean took my wrist in his hand and turned me around. \"Hey,nlisten. Thanks for letting me stay in your room and everything.\" Incould tell he didn't want to 'thank' me, but did anyway. \"Heynno worries, I'm used to sleeping on the couch when it gets too hotnin my room.\" I turned the knob and pushed the plain white doornopen. Sean's eyes widened at the first glance at my room, it wasn'tna normal girly room. Sure it had splashes of pink and purple on thenwalls, but it was solid, very dark gray, with splashes of waterncolours and rainbow colours on the wall. Thenreally only thing girly about my room was the stuffed animals and thenwhite canopy bed that sat in the middle of the room, then again Inalso had a vanity covered with make-up and jewelry. \"Indon't feel comfortable sleeping in your room…\" I laughed,nloudly. \"Whynnot?\" Sean looked at me with a 'are-you-retarded' look. \"Boy…\"nhe pointed towards himself and then towards me, \"girl.\" I sighednand pushed him in my room. \"Nightynnight Sean.\" (A/N:nRevised; June 23 rd 2009.

Fin.)[Chapter 2] AHH! Disclamier: I DO NOT own Journey to the Center of the Earth , but I did ask this category to be put in :D My eyes snapped open as the sound of my mother's voice reached my ears. \"Alexis Hannah-\" She cut off my last name, but I got the idea, I needed to get up, off this comfy couch. I rolled on my side and waved my hand dismissively. \"5 more minutes mom.\" She groaned and came over, rolling me off the couch and on to the floor. \"YOUCH!\" I screamed, rolling on my left side and sitting on my butt. I mumbled under my breath something, I wasn't supposed to say, but did and got up. My hair was sticking in every direction and my shirt and pants were rolled up. I yawned and my shirt went up just a tad more when Sean came around the corner. \"Eep! So sorry Sean\" I squeaked out to him, rounding around him and going into my bedroom, it was clean ? I looked in the closet and found my baggy cargo pants, they were Cami, I put my white spaghetti strapped shirt on, covering it with my Invader Zim jacket on. I searched around my room and found my high top converse; packing my bag with everything, hair brush, mirror, PSP , and clothes. I already know that my mom was going to pack food and water and sleeping bags. I slipped my checkered backpack onto my right shoulder and came out, trying to tame my hair, when I did, I put it up in a high ponytail. I sighed, \"Mum, you almost doneeee?\" I asked in my whining voice. \"Yeah, two minutes\" She answered back. I groaned and sat next to Sean. \"Hey\" I said to him, he turned his head and opened his mouth. \"Hey, What's up?\" \"Nothing, we gotta wait for my mum\" \"Oh, it's ok, Uncle Trevor takes long time in the bathroom anyway\" I giggled, \"Really?\" \"Yea, he's worse than a girly-girl\" \"Ah, my mum is like that, but she is a girly-girl\" \"Yea, I saw your PSP earlier, What games do you play?\" \"Guitar Hero and I write to my friends in New York\" Lacing New York with a New Yorker accent. \"Sweet, Guitar Hero rules\" \"Sheyea! It is\" I checked my watch; 10:23 a.m. I blew air out of my mouth and looked at him. \"Do you have a boyfriend?\" I nearly choked on my gum I was chewing on. I looked at him and he flushed. OK, not what I was expecting. \"N-No\" I choked on my words, \"You have a girlfriend?\" \"Nope\" He said, almost like he practiced it. I watched his every move and finally my mother and that Trevor dude are done. \"Let's go\" My mom says and then we were out in my mum's car, driving to volcano. Once we were at the foot at the mountain, mom got out and started climbing, \"Come on Alexis, Trevor, Sean\" She called out our names, me and Sean climbed together, just in case one of us happened to tumble backwards. We were about 2/3, not even about maybe a yard away from the tip when mom turned around and stopped for a second, \"Come on guys, girl we need to be home a sundown\" \"Can't you slow down a bit?\" Trevor asked. My mother didn't reply, of course. I slowed down and my mother turned, she had reached the top frist, then out of the blue, Sean turned to Trevor. \"Dibs\" \"What?\" \"I have dibs on the mountain guide.\" I don't know if Trevor saw my look of disappointment and depressed, but he came back with a snappy com back. \"Your thirteen\" \"Sorry, called dibs\" \"But! Thirteen-year-olds' don't get dibs\" Sean started climbing up and yelled back to Trevor, \"GET OVER IT\" Trevor looked at me, \"Sorry\" I was taken back, \"W-What do you mean?\" \"I saw the way you were lookin' at him, you've got a crush\" I blushed and glared at him, \"Do not\" \"Do so\" \"Do not\" \"Do not\" \"DO SO!\" \"Ha ha, told you\" \"GOD! He acts like a freakin' child!!\" I swore under my breath and started up after the group. Finally we reached the top and I came up with a plan to make Sean jealous. Trevor took out this beeping machine and explained what it was. \"It tells me where the device I'm looking for is\" As we walked to the center of the volcano more and more, the beeping accelerated. \"AH! There it is\" He cried out with fake hope. \"What do you got to do with it?\" My mother asked. \"Well I've got to unlock it\" He took out this key type thing and stuck it in the machine and tried to unlock it. My mother looked up, her and I carefully examined the sky, the clouds were excessively getting darker and darker and we could hear thunder. \"I'm really sorry Trevor, but we have to go now\" My mother finally said. \"Mom its ok, I think we will be fine\" Trevor tried to pull up the machine. He tried a few more times and I had to help the poor man. Lightning started to strike as me and Trevor tried to pull the damn thing up, it was lodged into the ground. My mother took Sean by the shoulders. \"We need to find cover now!\" She pushed him along into a cave, \"You to Alexis\" \"God she almost forgot about her damn daughter\" I mumbled under my breath, I think Trevor heard me because he started to laugh. I ran over with my mother and tried to watch Trevor, try to pull that thing out of the freakin ground. \"I don't think he'll get it\" I whispered to Sean, he nodded his head and watched careful over his Uncle. Soon, Trevor pulled it out and raised it to the sky, \"YES I GOT IT!\" He yelled then, lightning struck next to him, scaring the shit out of him, he stared to run. Sean, my mom, and me were yelled out to him, \"HURRY UP\" and \"FORGET IT\" The lightning followed him it seemed like everywhere he went til my mother shouted something. \"DROP THE MACHINE TREVOR, THE LIGHTNING IS ATTRACTED TO IT!!\" As Trevor swiftly moved thru the rocks, he dropped it and dashed into the cave, when the lightning struck the machine, it exploded, sending a tremor threw the ground and up the cave walls, making the cave entrance collapse. \"EVERYONE OK!?\" I yelled out, coughing from the dirt going up my nostrils. \"Yeah\" Came three of three people's voices. When Sean looked up, he started to freak out. \"COME ON GUYS, YOU GOTTA HELP ME DIG!\" He yelled out. \"Calm down Sean\" We all tried to help, but finally my mom said something to Trevor, who was staring at her arse . \"Forget it; It's no use\" \"We're gonna have to find another way\" Trevor said. \"Another way!?\" Sean took out his cellphone and tried to get bars. My mom took out headlights, giving one to everyone, but me. \"Hey, where's mine mum?\" \"I told you to pack\" \"YEAH! For a hiking trip not a freakin cave dive!!\" \"You gotta stay close to someone then\" The timing was perfect! Making Sean jealous, I'll stay close to Trevor. I glanced at Sean and smiled, \"Ill stay close to Trevor then\" Sean looked confused, so did Trevor. I huddled next to him. \"Making him jealous?\" Trevor asked, smirking. \"Yep\" Trevor laughed a bit and we started down the cave tunnel. After a minutes, maybe, Trevor started talking. \"Direction is my sixth sense, Sean, Watch and learn\" All of a sudden, my mom came out pushing me backwards onto Sean, making him fall onto the cold, stone floor and she hugged Trevor from behind and pulled him over, there, there was a gaping hole in front of us. Trevor was gasping for air, nearly death, I can get why. \"AHEM\" Someone said. I looked behind and saw that Sean was still under me and I quickly got up, hiding my blush. \"Sorry and thanks for the catch\" \"No problem\" The out of no where, Trevor had a stick of fire in his hand. \"1....2.....\" Then BOOM. He went flying back as he looked up, \"What the?\" He checked the walls of the cave, \" Magnesium\" \"Magnesium is kinda um.. Flam able isn't it Trevor?\" \"Yea, kinda \" My mom pulled out a glow stick and snapped it, \"Wouldn't this be easier?\" \"Yeah\" He got it from Hannah and walked over to the edge. \"1....2.....3!\" He dropped it and Sean started counting. \"Almost 3\" Sean said. \"200 feet?\" Trevor said, \"Got rope?\" \"Always\" My mom replied, already having it out. After she set up the pulleys and showed Sean and Trevor how to, Trevor began scaling the walls, sending me tied with Sean. Our thighs were touching, that's how close we were. \"OK, Sean don't worry, I'll help alot \" I said, helping him get his footing. Soon after my mom followed me and Sean down the same rope. Sean's footing slipped and taking me down with him, we both yelped. \"Hey watch it\" Trevor called up. \"Shut up\" Sean said, I looked at him. \"Make conversation with me\" Sean looked over. \"Do you come here often Alexis?\" \"Oh, come on your in a cave Sean!\" Trevor called up laughing. \"You try making conversation with her!\" He called back, now that made me giggle. \"No Sean I don't come here often\" All of a sudden, Trevor lost his footing and went down, the weight on our rope caught him, but his rope was to messed up the continue with it. \"I'm going to cut it\" My mom said to Trevor. \"What? NO!\" Trevor yelled back. \"Yeah, NO!\" Sean said too. I kinda shook my head and my mom cut the rope. \"NO!\" Sean yelled. There was a thump and Sean, me, and my mother looked at Trevor, he was at the bottom. It was right under him. \"HAHA! Stupid\" I cried out with heartfilled laughter, watching Trevor glare at me. Sean kinda laughed as we scaled down the rest of the wall, jumping off Sean helped Trevor up. \"Hey, Hannah, did you know the bottom was right here, or did you guess?\" Hannah kinda looked over her shoulder and didn't answer. \"I would take that as a 'no'\" I replied for my mom, my British accent lancing every word. Hey, sorry if its too short, not all the events are the same as the movie, so sorry If i screwed up anything. -VintageMassMurderer-[Chapter 3] Wait? So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 3: It's kinda like a roller coaster ride I helped my mother get all the rope back into its original position, in a circle like pose. As everyone got their supplies back onto their backs, I notcied that Sean was shinning his flashlight around the hallow cave. As Trevor got his pack on, I heard Sean call out something. \"Hey guys? What's this?\" he shinned his dimmering light over in the near by closed down mine shaft. \"This is one of the biggest disasters,\" Hannah said. She shinned more over her flashlight into the cave as Sean gave a quiet, yet notable gulp. \"How big?\" \"Eighty-one....dead,\" my mother replied with such tension in her voice it had made me nerve racked. \"That's pretty big,\" Trevor said. His eyes were wide. \"No, really?\" I mumbled sarcastically. My mom had already started traveling into the mine tunnel. I was so intrigued in my surroundings that all the noise was blocked out from my mid. The water that was perception above, was leaking down and making calcite on the number of soda straws that were being made. The lights that were glimmering off the walls, it looked so beautiful. Then something caught my ear, Trevor had brought my grandfather into the conversation, it was blocked out by a faint buzzing noise, but I heard some parts of it. The most important part I heard. \"I am not like my father,\" my brow ferried in disgust. My mother thought my grandfather was crazy, yet I didn't. \"Hannah?\" Sean called out. My frown deppened because no one was worried for me. I turned a corner and saw my mom messing with a control panel of some sorts, most likely for electricity. \"What's that?\" \"This is the old generator for the mine,: \"Hey! You don't want to touch that!\" that set me off. What was he, some kind of sexist pig? \"Hey, my mother can do what she wants,\" I spoke in a low voice. Both Trevor and Sean were quiet surprised. \"She could shock herself, or worse,\" Of course, this argument ended with sparks and the lights flickering on. \"See?\" I said kinda of snobby. I watched as all the lights turned on in a pattern and faltered off way in the back. my eyes were as large as dinner plates or U.F.O's. Trevor raised his hands in defeat and laughed. \"Okay, I take it back!\" we all stared in amazement, until yet again, my mother walked off. \"Is this it? I mean the minors had to get their stuff in and out somewhere, right?\" \"Yeah,\" Sean got one of those imaginary light bulbs over his head. I think we had the same thought, because at the same time we yelled out, \"SHOTGUN!/I CALL FRONT!!\" we both pushed and shoved, tiring to get into the old, metal cart. \"Hold on son,\" Trevor called out to Sean, wavering his light. \"We don't even know if these things work,\" I felt a jerk forward and saw my mom. \"Hello,\" I called out awkwardly. Both me and Sean were sitting in the front, side by side, both of our hips touching once again. \"Get in Trevor,\" my mother commanded. With no complaints he got in the second cart, behind me and Sean and wee took off. Before we got going, I went in the back of Sean and held on to his waist. \"I never did liked roller coasters,\" you know you get that feeling when someone is smirking well, it was one of those times. \"I think I see something,\" Sean called out. I don't want to know what it is , I repeated inside my head. I held on tighter as I heard him say what it was. \"Your going to be pissed,\" then my stomach dropped and I started screaming like a little girl. There was no end to the stomach dropping. I felt like I was going to hurl. \"Why isn't there seat belts on these things?!\" Sean yelled back to Trevor. \"Your worried about seat belts?!\" the turns and twists kept coming and when I opened my eyes, I regretted it one-hundred percent. There about seventeen yards away was a huge hole in the track. \"Hannah?!\" I heard Sean yell back. \"I know!\" there was some yelling going on about \"pulling the break,\". I saw the gap coming closer and closer until \"whoosh,\" we were flying. It lasted about several seconds then I jerked my head forward, making my head fall into the back of Sean's back. \"YEAH!\" I heard Sean scream, but I was scared shitless to open my eyes. \"Stay put son!\" I wanted to see what the screaming was about. I opened one eye and saw we had split from my mom and Trevor. They were on the above tracks, but I was scared and held on Sean's waist tighter. \"Scared?\" Sean mocked me. \"Y-Yes,\" I held on even tighter. I might be a sissy about this, but like I said before, \"I never liked roller coasters,\". Sean laughed at my miserable moment and held onto my hands with his own. You might say, \"it was an adorable, romantic couple moment,\" but ohhhhh, no. I was near tears, but suddenly the cart was slowing down to a halt. I looked at Sean and semi-smiled. I looked over and saw Hannah and Trevor on the floor talking. I released my hands from his waist as he released my hands, he jumped out of the cart. \"That...was...amazing!!!\" it was like a five year old that broke open his first pinata. But, myself I turned over on the right side of the cart and hurled all of the wheels and the side of it. (Author's note: I FINALLY UPDATED!!!! I'm sorry, my niece broke it -twitch- so we had to buy a new one. I was cleaning my room and said, \"Why the hell not?\" So I watched that part and wrote it down on scratch paper then wrote it on here! W00t! -VintageMassMurderer- -()-Review, Favorite, Alert, Flame-()-[Chapter 4] Wait? So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 4: Diamonds are not a girl's best friend. After hurling up my breakfast and part of my fast dinner, I made my way over to Trevor and my mom. They were dusting themselves off and I noticed Sean. He was walking over to an opening in the wall that Trevor's cart had made. \"Uh, hey what's this?\" that question seemed to be popping up alot now. Hannah walked over, followed by myself and Trevor. \"A secret cave?\" I put out in the open. We carefully walked through the small opening and before I knew it we were surrounded by emeralds and rubies, and diamonds? While Trevor and Hannah were looking at the other minerals on the wall, me and Sean went to the diamonds. We were digging them out with either our hands or Sean's pocket knife. They were so beautiful, crystal clear and untouched my human hands. I through two.... or ten more diamonds into my bag and looked around. \"I'm rich,\" Sean sang out, putting the last diamond into his bag and turning. Trevor was spouting off about volcanic tubes or something similar. I walked a step and we all heard a loud cracking noise, it was coming from below us? Trevor looked at the ground as Hannah actually bent down and grazed the ground with her fingertips. Hannah looked at Trevor, then at me. \"Muskovite,\" \"What's muskovite?\" \"It's a very thin type of rock,\" \"How thin?\" I asked nervously. \"Well, the slightest change in pressure would crack it,\" Trevor replied, \"move slowly over here,\" both Sean and I stepped heel-toe, heel-toe. We stopped of a slight moment and Sean slipped his backpack over his shoulder and a diamond dropped out of his bag and landed straight down and then crack! We watched intensely when nothing happened everyone laughed and sighed, then the ground slipped from under us. We were screaming for several moments, then stopped. We all looked at each other and down, we started talking, or more like screaming. \"WE'RE STILL FALLING!?!\" Trevor screamed. Then like Christmas carolers we all screamed in chorus. Oh god, my other half of my dinner, I thought covering my mouth. I let go and grabbed the nearest persons hand, which happened to be Sean's. We all linked hands and continued to scream. The fall got drastic and we let go. \"Trevor, what's at the bottom?!\" Sean screamed over to him. He started spouting off about spets or something similar to that. \"Or the cave could have eroded to fill with water,\" he paused for breath, \"kinda like a water slide,\" I could hear Sean next to me, \"Water slide, please be a water slide,\" my eyes widened in fear. \"I don't know how to swim though,\" I don't think anyone heard me. \"Or we can be skewered,\" Hannah replied. Sean looked from my mom to Trevor and started screaming starting a chain reaction. After a few more moments of falling tiny bubbles erupted from the darkness. They were splashing me? \"Water?!\" my mom yelled, touching her cheek. \"Yes, water,\" Trevor replied as calmly as he could. \"Water slide,\" I could hear Sean repeat continuously. \"Here it comes, hang on!\" Trevor yelled over Sean's loud mumbling. We all screamed louder than times before and then I hit cold water. I started screaming even more as we washed down the tunnel like structure. I tried to find anyone else, no such luck. I finally spotted Sean and tried to move over. I was so close until we landed butt first into water. I started kicking my way through the water; very slowly. My legs were getting tired as I tried to reach Sean and Trevor with no success, I stopped and rested from kicking. I saw Trevor jump back into the water to help my mom. As I finally reached surface, someone grabbed my arm and helped me up. I was panting like a dog in Summer. I looked up and noticed it was Sean. \"Thanks,\" \"No prob,\" he said as he went to help my mother out of the water. I slipped off my jacket and stuffed it inside my bag. Now a wet shirt was sticking to me like honey on bees. I fell back as did Sean, my mom, and Trevor. I closed my eyes as my heart went back down to its normal rate. \"Is it just me or is the ceiling moving?\" I heard Sean ask. \"It's probably the water's reflection,\" \"I think I see it too,\" I took Sean's side. Staring up at the ceiling, it started to fall. They were glowing birds? We all stood up in amazement as my mouth was set a gap. (Author's Note: ehhhhhhh.......-whiny voice- I took me forever to write this chapter!!!!! Stupid Trevor and all his big words.. :P Some places aren't right or I cut things out like the part when Hannah says ________________________- something skewered. Sorry -bows- I like those birdies by the way. I only ended it there 'cause I need to know what they are called, lol XD. THIS IS SOOOO SHORT, I'M VERY VERY SORRY!! End of Author Note)[Chapter 5] Wait? So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 5: The Center? I slowly moved my mouth up and rolled my tongue back inside my mouth. Sean looked amazed, he had that look of an innocent five year old; it was adorable. One of the birds flew down next to me and Sean and swooped around our heads tweeting along the way. I smiled and silently giggled as the birds flew into a crack inside the cave we were in. \"Hey,\" Trevor called after them. All of us, including myself followed my mother through the crack and then we came to a stop. It was amazing. \"Wow,\" was the only word that escaped from any ones mouth, then Trevor had to go and ruin it all. \"My brother, your father Sean, was right. No one believe him, but now we can prove him wrong,\" Trevor said, patting Sean's shoulder. Sean smiled and turned towards my mom. \"Your dad was right too, Hannah. You too Alexis,\" my name rolled of his tongue it seemed like. I seeped in the colorful world that was inside a beautiful world. Not yet touched by millions of hands and feet, preserved for the adventurers who dared to try what we have tried. The color was so lush, it was almost like a beautiful dream that would never end. The sky was clear, except for a glowing, firing ball of fire coming from the center of the sky. From this point of view it looked like a tropical rain forest with a set of dark colors. \"Alexis, come on,\" I heard my name being called and saw that my friends were already half way down. I screeched and ran down the mountain and followed Sean, who was at the end. I grabbed Sean's bag as he twisted his head around. \"Yeah?\" \"My bag, I left it at the river,\" Sean smiled. \"Actually, your mom got it when her and Trevor ran back to the river bend,\" I smiled and ran ahead of Sean. I tripped and fell flat on my face as Sean laughed and ran up to help me up. I gasped and wiped my face from the blood that was dribbling down my cheekbone. \"Ow,\" Sean smirked and got a cloth of some sorts out and wiped away the blood. \"Hold it on the cut and I'll get your bag for you,\" I walked along with Sean, but he went ahead and grabbed my bag for me. \"Thanks,\" I grabbed it and attempted to through it on my back, but it fell to the ground and I gasped. Sean laughed lightly as I heard Trevor and Hannah's voices traveling farther and farther away. He pulled it off from the ground and handed it to me. \"Klutz,\" I made the 'hmpf,' noise and turned my head, grabbing my bag from him and walking away. \"Hey!!\" he called after me. I ignored him and kept walking. He finally caught up to me and pushed me playfully. \"Sheesh, can't take a joke?\" he asked playfully. I stuck out my tongue. \"Nooo,\" he smirked at my childish voice and I pushed him back playfully too. \"Come on we need to catch up,\" Sean grabbed my hand and we ran to catch up with Trevor and Hannah. (Author's Notes: OK, I lied the poll closed today at 10:00, because the votes were not changing, lol. Here it goes: Yes: 92%- 12 people No: 7%- 1 person So I will make one of the next chapters with Alexis's and Sean's first kissy -makes fish face- This was kinda showing that they were getting used to each others actions and excepting their feelings as friends/lovers.

So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 6: The Center Part 2 Once me and Sean had caught up with Trevor and my mom, Sean had let go of my hand, but he was still smiling. Trevor had seemed to be smiling too. It was pretty creepy, because the whole time we were traveling not once did he smile. Well, at least what I saw. Hannah kept looking back at me and Sean, smiling like a mother usually does. My eyes wondered around as I landed my eyes on Sean. He was gorgeous. Even though he was sweating, wet, and needed a shower, no offense to him, he was gorgeous. His smile kept shinning on his lips as he followed his uncle and my mom. He glanced of and smiled to me as I smiled back, I walked right into a giant tree. \"Oh fudge,\" I said. I fell on my back and was rubbing my throbbing head. Sean laughed for a moment and offered me his hand. \"Need help?\" I pouted and took his hand. He heaved me off the ground as he stared at the giant tree that I had run into. \"I want to go inside,\" I was going to say I don't think you can, but Sean proved me wrong. He ran to the oppisite side and climbed in through a hole big enough for Trevor. It was huge, inside and out. It was beautiful, just like everything else here. \"Coming?\" I heard Trevor ask my mother. \"Nah, I'm going to go look around,\" as my mom walked off, Trevor was staring at her arse. It was gross. \"Are you coming or are you going to watch my mom's ass all day?\" Trevor did a double take and blushed. He walked in front of me and I stood outside the tree. I sulked against the outside and bobbed my head up and down. My eye sight was blurring. There has been alot of things going on. I closed my eyes, until someone was shaking me. It was Sean. \"What's up?\" I yawned. Sean's eyes were red like he had been crying. I tilted my head side to side. Sean looked up and put his head on my shoulder. \"We found my dad...\" I looked at him, more confused that before. \"Isn't that good?\" Sean's eyes closed and twisted like he was going to cry. \"We found him... he was dead,\" my eyes widened and a wave a sadness washed over me and I grabbed Sean and hugged him close. \"I'm sorry Sean, I am really sorry. I know how it feels to lose your dad,\" I mumbled into his neck. I felt wetness running down the back of my shirt. \"He-He...\" \"Shh shh shh,\" I whispered, petting his hair like my mom did when she told me about my dad. \"You need rest Sean,\" I whispered into his ear and helped him up. I lead him up into the tree and saw Trevor and Hannah looking at a map. I closed my eyes and set Sean down onto the swinging bed and when his head hit the netting his eyes closed and he was fast asleep. \"Alexis?\" I heard my mom call me. I turned my head and looked at her. \"Yeah?\" \"Do you like Sean?\" I choked on my own spit as Trevor laughed at my reaction. My eyes turned a slight red along with my cheeks. \"Do you?\" I looked back at Sean and looked down. \"Yeah,\" my face flushed a different color and I felt a hand take a hold of my shoulder. I looked up and saw it was Trevor's hand. \"Yeah?\" \"I think Sean likes you too,\" my face flushed even more. \"I think I'm going to sleep,\" I sat in the far corner and I closed my eyes once more, welcoming slumber. (Author's Note: Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh??? How was it? I'm sleepy, sorry if I made mistakes and I'm changing the plot just a little so the story is :::a little::: longer. I am working on a poem!! -THANK YOU FOR THE REVIEWS~!! Fin.)[Chapter 7] Wait! So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 7: Dreams and Plans to Escape Journey We left on a journey, Down the road of life we went. We were trapped and left to die, but then your uncle came along and saved our butts. We held hands and hugged along the way, But now it's the hardest thing I will ever have to do. Shall I pick life or should I pick you? I tossed and turned in my sleep, I felt the coldness of the bark under my shoes and the walls scratching my arms. I felt someone lift me up, I weakly opened my eyes and saw a blurred version of Trevor. The image faltered and my eyes closed as my body welcomed the sleep I rightly deserved. \"Mama what ever happened to my daddy?\" a smaller version of Alexis asked a younger version of Hannah. My mother's eyes blurred with not forgotten tears of sadness. She turned to me and pulled me into a hug and snuggled into the crevice of my neck and sucked in air. \"Your daddy died the day you were born,\" my eyes widened and I started sobbing. The one that was going to raise me along with my mom had died the day I was born? The one that was going to teach me to play his favorite sport? This wasn't true, my mom was lying to me. I struggled against her arms and screamed. \"MY DADDY IS NOT DEAD!! HE IS NOT!!\" I flipped out and tried to pry myself from her warm embrace. She cried even more and hugged me closer. \"It is true baby. Alexis Hannah Gray.... Your father did die, he was mad and is dead,\" my mom, by the sound of her voice she wasn't lying. \"No...no!!\" I screamed, tears streaming down my cheeks and I cried even harder. She patted my head softly and whispered into my ear that he did love me, but I knew that wasn't true. The more the dream came down, the more I tossed and turned. Then someone was shaking me. \"Alexis....Alexis....Alexis you need to wake up!\" I cried and tried to push the person away as I cried even more and screamed in my sleep. The person's hands wrapped around my arms and shook me again. \"WAKE UP!\" my eyes snapped open and reveled the person as Sean. He was sweating along with some dried tears on his face. I took a deep breath and looked at him once again. \"H-hey,\" I answered meekly. He turned red and got off me and laid back down. \"You were screaming in your sleep, I thought you were dying,\" he turned over and stared at me. It looked like we were sleeping, but we were sharing a simple conversation. \"Why were you screaming?\" \"I had a-a nightmare,\" Sean rolled his eyes. \"Nooo, really?\" I giggled slightly and looked at him in the eyes. \"About the day....the day my mother told me about my father,\" Sean looked down and then back up. \"I'm sorry,\" I looked kindly at Sean and smiled. \"It's not your fault,\" Sean looked down once again. \"Yeah, but I brought it up,\" I giggled quietly and looked down to see my mother and Trevor cuddling. I frowned and looked at Sean. Now we can't be together, I thought. I scooted closer to Sean until my head was up against his chest. I could hear his heart beating faster and faster. I smiled and laid down on his chest. My eyes began to shut and I swear I heard Sean say something. \" I do like you, \" I shook my head and knew it was either a joke or I was hallucinating. I shut my eyes and finally fell asleep, no dreams coming to my mind. As the daylight lit up the tree and the flowers were opening for the first taste of day, Trevor and Hannah were up and wet? I looked at my mom like she was crazy and she smiled meekly. My hair was bedragged and my clothes were on half backwards. Trevor was shaking his wet hair as my mother was drying her self in the sunlight. I looked at Sean, who either had just gotten up or was just laying there while I slept on him. I yawned and reached my hands up to the sky. \"Good morning,\" I said quietly. I got off the bed and walked over to my mother and hugged her, my clothes getting wet. \"Good thing I brought extra clothes, eh?\" I said. My mother laughed gingerly and handed me my bag. \"Go down to the beach and wash up,\" I shook my head and got my bag from my mother's hands and walked down to the beach. Once I got down there I looked around the perimeter and began to strip except my bra and black underwear. I took a few steps into the ocean and sat down in the sand. I lifted my hand filled with ocean water and poured it down my head and back, getting rid of the sweat and pain that this journey had cause me. I scrubbed my feet and underarms and finally got up and went into the deeper part of the ocean. Once I was deep enough I swan around for a bit. I closed my eyes for a moment and felt something tug at my foot. I gasped as it pulled me under. I tried to swim away, but whatever it was, it was too strong. Whatever it was let go and let me swim back to surface for a moment. I got freaked out and tried to swim back to land, the current didn't want me too, but soon I was there and I laid on the beach half naked. I wheezed and tried to get my breathing back to normal; when it didn't I got out my inhaler and did a couple puffs and started to breath normally. I got up after my attack and got dressed in short shorts and a long, white shirt. I slipped on my converse and through my wet stuff back into my bag and walked back to the tree. I was about half way there when Sean stopped me, he was wet too. I wondered if he was at the beach. I blushed and smiled. \"Why, hello Sean,\" I tried to get past him, but he moved along with me. I looked at him confused and he dug his foot into the sand. \"I-I have to tell you something,\" I smiled and got hold of his hand, trying to be flirtatious. \"What is it Sean?\" a light blush crept among his cheeks. \"W-Well, I w-well,\" he gave a weak breath and looked me in the eyes, \"I-I like you,\" I was shocked. Sean... Sean liked me? The one that had been crying the day before and the one I had known for three days... liked me? I blushed as my mind wondered around. \"I-I like you too,\" I smiled and felt something press against m lips. I opened my eyes and saw that Sean was kissing me. I panicked, this was my first kiss, I gently kissed back. Our hands were still connected and he was the one to break the kiss. He smiled as a blush brushed on his face. \"Sorry,\" I put a finger on his lips and kissed him gingerly. \"It's okay,\" I pulled away from his face, but I kept our hands connected and went along with him. Jeez, this was the happiest day of my life. It felt like I was flying, like I was never going to stop flying. I sighed and put my head on his shoulder. As we walked into camp Hannah and Trevor were smiling like crazy people and just sighed. Then I heard my mom, \"Aw, young love,\" I blushed and sat next to Sean, watching my mom and Trevor figure out how to get out of his forest. Out of the center of the earth. (Author's Note: Awwww!!! Sorry, I'm not very good with kissing scenes, sorry -bows and claps hands together- Gomen-nasai!! Los siento!! Je suis désolé!! Es tut mir leid!! Jag är ledsen!! Those all mean I'm sorry :() I hope you liked this chapter and hope I did good with the kissing scene. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE REVIEWS~!!! Fin.)[Chapter 8] Wait! So My Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? --VintageMassMurderer-- (C) Chapter 8: Building I snuggled close to Sean as we both watched Trevor and Hannah search for a way out of this place. I rested my head on Sean's shoulder and sighed. \"Sean?\" he looked at me and smiled. \"Yeah?\" \"What happens when we reach the surface? What will happen to us?\" I squeezed his hand and closed my eyes. I could hear Sean take a deep breath. \"I could ask my mom to move out with my uncle, and you ask your mother to move closer to us,\" I closed my eyes and thought of that situation and what trouble my mother would go through with packing and unpacking, she didn't even like change that much. So how could we? I breathed out and opened my eyes. \"I'll see,\" I said to him as I twirled a piece of his hair around my index finger and hummed a little tune my mother had taught me. Sean started to pet my hair like I did the night before for him. I closed my eyes once more and listened Sean finish the tune with his own made up notes. I slightly giggled as he made a d flat and not a d major. I started to sing along, saving him from having to finish it on his own. My singing may not be perfect, but it was better; much better than Sean's. \"Love birds!? We need to make a raft!\" my eyes snapped open and I looked over to my mom and Trevor. I smiled and got up as Sean got up too, he picked me off of the ground and swung me around couple times then set me down and held my hand as we walked over to the adults. Sean was blushing from doing that infront of my mother and Trevor, but he was confident. I loved that in a man. \"Well, Trevor pointed out in the book the people had made a raft and set off into the ocean and across the sea to get to a volcanic tube to set steam up and send us up onto the surface,\" my mother explained to us. Me and Sean looked at each other and sighed. \"Well, let's get to work,\" Trevor exclaimed clapping his hands together. Me and Sean set off to find wood to help build this \"raft\" Trevor and Hannah were rambling on about. A few hours later and Trevor and Sean were putting up the kite that would help us sail through the sky. I was back helping my mom order around the boys, once the kite was up and running the raft was moving by itself and we were off into the deep blue. Sean and Trevor had jumped on at the last moment as the raft went off. Helping my mom, Trevor tied the kite to the rain holds. Me and Sean were sitting back, watching the sky for the black clouds that signaled rain and thunder. Sean pulled me close as a big wave came up and the black clouds were heading straight for us; or we were heading straight for them. Either way, this was bad news, I knew it. (Author's Note: YAY!!!!!!!! I have 28 reviews and hopeful more as the stories keep coming up! Now that Sean and Alexis are a couple, Sean is more embarrassed to show his feelings. Thanks again and hope this chapter is up to your standards~! I am working on a (ammature) one shot for Sasuke for my B.F.I.T.W.F.W for her birthday, January 19th :) Fin.)[Chapter 9] Wait! So my Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? VintageMassMurderer Chapter 9: Up, up, and Away The inexplicable rain clouds hovered over our heads and the swift gusts of wind carried us along the deep blue sea. I was glancing over at Trevor and my mother every few moments to make sure they were doing okay. Suddenly, out of no where came the strongest gust of wind and rain start to pour down on our heads. I heard laughter and turned slightly, just peering over my should enough to see it was Sean that was laughing. I glared hard at his head. \"What?\" I hissed, unknowingly. He wiped an imaginary tear away from his eye and looked towards me; his drenched hair was covering his left eye and dripping down onto his shirt which clung to every muscle on his perfectly toned—what the hell am I saying? \"You looked like a bedraggled cat that was dunked into a tub of ice cold water.\" Truth was I was shivering like mad since I was waiting for his answer for about two minutes while my mom and Trevor talked about 'scientific' things. He draped his arms around my shoulders and tugged me towards his body. All I could do at that moment in time was blush like a tomato. \"Just a little storm, no big deal!\" Trevor screamed over the rolling thunder. He huddled next to my mom and kept small talk. Hannah stepped towards the edge of the \"raft\" and peered into the water, and as far as I could hear this were her exact words: \"Something's moving down there.\" She pointed towards some silvery objects moving swiftly towards the raft and doing a \"march\" zig-zag like line towards us and then away from us. \"Phosphorous plankton it's the same thing we saw back at the beach.\" He pointed back towards the sand area which was no where to be seen. Since me and Sean were now sitting down, Sean peered over the edge and yelled over the cackle of thunder and yowling of lightning: \"I don't know it looks a little big for plankton!\" he looked back towards his uncle. \"Son, we aren't at Sea World, so back up!\" he made a quick motion with his hands. \"I think it's some sort of fish…\" he mentioned loudly and shook his hair, making the tears of his feathery hair hit my skin. I giggled and that's when everything…everything went wrong. A giant fish, lodged itself out of the water and straight at Sean it was so fast I couldn't make out the figure, the color, or the physical appearance of it. After Sean maneuvered out of the way it went straight towards my mom! She screamed and it leapt back in the water, I stood up and looked around as another leapt onto the boat and directly at Trevor. He managed to push the fish off and I got a chance to look at the hideous thing. It looked exactly like that deep sea fish from Finding Nemo , but more bloodcurdling. It's spoiled teeth were rotting away from the gums and the teeth towards the end were more jagged, I guess so it can cut it's \"victim\" right open. I shivered and looked away as more started leaping out. \"They're everywhere!\" Sean screamed towards us as we huddled into a circle, back to back. Trevor walked over to the netting and pulled out three wooden sticks. How is it that I always get left out? Well as he threw them at everyone, excluding me, of course. They started to hit them as if they were baseballs. I watched and waited for the fish to leap out, suddenly a great force knocked me on my back, taking the breath right out of me. Laying on top of me in a great heap was a hideous fish. It started snapping as I reached out my hands and tried to pull it away from my face and it tried to wiggle its way out, trying to bite my head off. Finally after minutes of battling by hand, I flung it back out into the water and patted my hands on my jacket. \"I swear, worse than my mother…\" After a few more fist fights, I was so into it that I hadn't noticed that Sean was talking to his mother for a few minutes on his cell phone. I was waiting next to Sean this time waiting for the next fish to come out when suddenly a giant sea monster came out of the water and onto the freaking raft, almost crushing it. I screamed and leapt back out of harms way, seems like these things are only interested in the hideous fish… \"Get away from the sides!\" Trevor pulled all of us away from the sides as the monsters began to dine away at the fish. \"They seem to only be interested in the fish…\" Trevor called out, \"Listen Sean, Alexis take the stern, Hannah pull the slack!\" Trevor barked out orders and before anyone could say, 'Yo mama' people were at the stations waiting for orders. \"Take us north starboard.\" \"What?\" \"What way!!\" Trevor screamed while pointing over to in a direction. Slowly, but surely, my mom and Trevor loosened the slack easily, but then something went terribly wrong. The wind got to strong and forced the \"kite\" up into the air and my mother went flying back, bleeding from her hands. I wanted to rush to her side, but was to scared to, I was glued to the spot. Instead I screamed out to her: \"You alright mom?\" she looked back as Trevor ripped his shirt and tied it around her wounds. She smiled her 'mom' smile and turned back to Trevor. The kite roping was coming unraveled, and apparently me and Sean thought the same thing, \"grab the rope and hold it down\", unfortunately that wasn't such a great plan. At first it would be, but then the wind in the sky got so strong it swept me and Sean off the raft. I could feel it, there was no ground underneath me and for the first time in a long time I screamed in pure horror. More and more we were floating into the sky, the screams and chants from behind us getting softer and soon all that was around me was thunder and lightning, that was the last thing I saw… the last thing I heard was Sean's voice: \"Hold on…\" (A/N: it's been such along time, has my typos gotten better on this chapter? I sure hope so, people keep reminding me of my mistakes :P. I hope this chapter makes up for the five months of NOT updating. I'm a bad person, tsk tsk tsk... LMAO. Anyways, review and alert or whatever you'd like to do, just do something!! Haha, OH! by the way, if you want to give thanks to the person which got me back on this story here: DrkAngel20 thank her, she gave me a great idea. Once again, I KNOW I MADE TYPOS lol, once the series is DONE, I WILL GO BACK AND RE-WRITE IT, gosh xD Fin.)[Chapter 10] Wait! So my Grandfather Wasn't Crazy? TornPrince'sSmile Chapter 10: Finding Love or Possible Hell? (A/N: I have changed my name again, only because someone hacked my account, which cause some of my stories to be deleted, the only way to get rid of the hacker was to change my name and password to something off topic from my e-mail and account name. Thanks for reading and sorry for the, hellish, long wait. Enjoy : ) Two dark figures stood, levitating of some sorts, off the ground. Their black hellish grins illuminated the darkened cave. \"Who--What are you?\" I stammered through the breath that was currently stuck in her throat. \"That is not important right now dear one, but you must heed our warning.\" The two figures spoke in perfect harmony, not breaking their sinister looks. \"What warning?\" They turned towards each other with the same hellish grin again and turned back to me. \"If you don't wake up, you'll be gone with the tide.\" My eyes widened as my mouth opened. \"W-what?\" \"You heard us right child, now wake up. Listen to our voice, wake up my child.\" The figures slowly dispersed and a new vision arrived, one of a white, glowing, angel. \"Wake up Alexis, don't die, you have a life, a future; you need to wake up.\" Slowly my eyes opened... blurred vision, but I awoke. My head whipped up, staring straight into the open ocean, the storm clouds were slowly disappearing and the sun approached again. \"Sean?\" There was no answer, no noise unless you count the soft bird's chirping... wait, birds? I tried to stand up, but my head felt like it was about to explode and I fell down on my butt. I groaned, hanging my head between my legs and cried softly. \"I'm going to die, huh?\" I was talking to myself, that was a great start, \"I need to try to find Sean... That's all that matters now.\" I wiped my hands on my pants, or what was left of my pants, and slowly stood up. Once I started to walk, I noticed I was limp. I glanced down and saw a large gash running from my thigh towards my calve and stop, blood slowly trickled down my leg as I stared. I stripped of my jacket and wrapped it around my leg, I only wanted to stop the bleeding, now making sure it didn't get infected was a different story. I limped towards the chirping, following the voice, almost as if it were calling to me. I turned corner after corner, wanting to end up in Sean's arms. My leg was burning badly, I think my leg gash is infected from the sea water, that's what was causing the burning sensation more or likely. I limped more and more, rounding each corner was killing me, the sun wasn't helping either, I was deadly dehydrated. I licked my cracking lips, my skin felt so dry and itchy, it felt like thousands of spiders were crawling on me and eating my flesh. I heard something; was I hallucinating now too? No! This was real, I could hear Sean, Sean was calling for me. \"Sean!\" I cried out, I wanted to find him, no I needed to find him, right now. My voice was cracking and I felt faint. \"Alexis!? Alexis?!\" I heard him! It was him, I limped faster and faster as fast as my legs could carry me. I rounded another corner and fell into a jumbled pile of blood. I gasped and looked at the vision in front of me... \"SEAN!\" I screamed, I was so happy to see him. He looked at me up and down and gave me a worried look. \"What happened?\" I felt dizzy and I held my forehead. \"Water... water...\" and then blackness. (A/N: Okay this was written at 3:46 in the morning so I was kind of out of ideas, I was scheduled to do something else, but I decided to do something different. Thanks for reading, please review : ) F i n .[Chapter 11] Wait! So my Grandfather wasn't Crazy? By TornPrince'sSmile Chapter 11: More important business (As told in Sean's POV) I watched her body drop to the ground. Her face was red and her lips were cracked and then I remembered her last words: water . I gasped dramatically and thought of possible things she could have and the first thing that popped into my head was dehydration. I panicked and remembered that my little bird friend showed me a small water stream earlier. I quickly picked up Alexis and hoped to dear god she didn't hit her head. *)(* I was almost there; I could hear the small splashing of water against the warm rocks. I stepped over a small pile of red rocks and dropped her right into the cool water. After a few minutes, her face regained its original color and her lips looked less cracked, until before. I got impatient and dipped under the water myself and opened her mouth, making the cold water dripped down her, probably, dry throat. I started wondering if I was doing something wrong because she wasn't waking up. My hand dropped from her face as it trailed down to her leg, where, she had wrapped her jacket tightly around her calve section. I slowly un-wrapped it and saw a bloody mess. My eyes widened in shock as I started to clean out the infected wound. 'I wonder how she got this mess…' I thought to myself as I cringed at the blood coming out. I never liked blood ever since the baseball incident with my uncle; let's just leave it as there was a lot of blood. Slowly, but surely, the wound stopped bleeding as I tore a rather large part of my shirt off and wrapped it gingerly around her cut. After I dragged her body out of the cold water, I watched her chest heave itself up and down in a rhythmic dance. I only hoped that she was alright now, since it looked only like she was sleeping. \"God, she scared the living crap out of me… fainting like that.\" I shook my head and smiled lightly. I hope she was well. *)(* After a good thirty minutes, her eyes slowly opened to relieve those blue eyes that I adored. She smiled gingerly and caressed her hand over my jaw and chin. \"I thought I died…\" she said quietly, \"I saw a bright light and saw your face and my mom's… then my father's.\" I was confused by her statement. \"But you've never seen your father before, how could… you?\" Alexis shrugged her shoulder lightly and sat up. I cringed after she cringed and looked down at her leg. \"You fixed it?\" I smiled widely at her. \"Yes, does it feel any better?\" I have never seen such a wide smile on anyone's face before. \"Yes it does, Mr. Doctor.\" I laughed lightly and hugged her; surprising both her and me. Why did I just hug her? \"I was so worried about you. You… you just fainted. I thought you hit your head or something.\" Alexis giggled meekly and wrapped her arms around my waist. \"I'm glad.\" I could feel liquid seeping through my shirt. I looked out of the corner of my eye and saw she was crying. My eyes dropped. \"What's wrong?\" Her eyes snapped open and she kissed my cheek. \"Nothing… I'm just happy to see you.\" I nodded my head; I knew how she felt. *)(* After I helped Alexis get off the ground she grabbed me and kissed my lips, almost like she'd never see me again. I wrapped an arm around her and pulled her closer; I just noticed how short she was compared to me… She was the first to pull away for air, but she smiled all the same. \"We should head out Sean. I wanna find my mom and Trevor,\" she then added, \"plus I wanna get out of this crazy place.\" I agreed with her and took her around the waist as we fled to find our guardians.

Disclaimer: I do not own Journey to the Center of the Earth , I only own Alexis and some parts of the plot. By the way, I did request the section in this website ;) Chapter 12: Lies, blame game, and more lies It wasn't hard to find the way towards the exit… I mean it was the only way we could go… Actually, before that, we traveled a LONG ways… We scrambled over rocky hills and grassy areas, bugs snipping their jaws on our skin. I was non-so lucky; I had lots of mosquito bites, my head was killing me, and we were walking a bit to fast for my likes. \"You okay?\" I lied again, \"yeah, of course; why wouldn't I?\" Sean shrugged, \"you look tired is all.\" I rolled my eyes and turned away from him and for the trillion time today we stopped; he re-wrapped my leg bandage and made sure I had enough water. \"You're really worried aren't you?\" Sean smiled lightly as he took the blood soaked cloth and dampened it with the cold, refreshing water that lay in a material jug. \"Yes… If anything were to happen to you I would blame myself.\" \"Do you blame yourself?\" \"What?\" I smiled curiously as a cat and raised my fingers towards the radiating heat, \"I was hurt, but it wasn't your fault; do you blame yourself?\" Sean looked at me skeptically. \"Yeah, I do. You got hurt looking for me, I feel absolutely at fault here.\" I whined and argued back. \"But it isn't your fault; I'm the one that fainted because I WAS stupid to not drink the water I sat by…\" I lied again… \"What?\" his voice was angry and it held some hostility, \"you sat by water… and didn't drink any?\" \"I didn't think I would need to, I didn't think it was that hot outside.\" \"Well it is!\" he yelled at me, his voice cracking, \"you need to take care of yourself.\" He was truly, generally worried for my well-being. \"Sean…\" I touched his shoulder lightly, but he retracted from my touch as if I was blazing hot and stared at me; a cold, cold stare. \"Let's get going.\" Gosh darn it, he was mad at me. -- \"Come on Alexis.\" Sean called after me, I was trailing behind him. My legs hurt and my head was pounding, \"I'm going as fast as I can.\" I tripped and fell, he looked back, but didn't necessarily help; he was still angry at me. We stopped again, resting for a while as I caught my breath. \"I ain't mad at you.\" Sean said softly, his voice traveling off into silent murmurs. \"What?\" \"I said I ain't mad at you.\" He repeated again, his time his voice carried much more as it echoed through out the 'desert' surroundings. \"Why were you ignoring me then?\" I asked painfully as his expression changed to one of sorrow. \"I don't know… I think I was more mad at myself then you Alexis. I mean—.\" \"I know what you mean you big lug.\" I answered back quietly as I wrapped my arms around him, \"just promise me one thing and one thing only.\" \"What is that princess?\" I chuckled, \"you'll help me when I fall.\" \"Of course, now come on, we got to get going.\" He pulled me up as we started towards a gap. \"And what in hells name is this?\" Rocks were hovering above the ground? What was next a dinosaur?[Chapter 13] Chapter 13: What have I gotten myself into? Wait!

I only own Alexis, my original character, and some parts of the plot. I did ask for this category in fan fiction though ;) I grabbed Sean's hand with my own, the clammy feeling was growing over to his hand, yet he didn't pull away. Did I ever mention I had this deathly fear of heights? Well if I didn't already, let me mention it now. Sean's hand was pulsating with heat, making my hand ever clammier. I was shivering, but I was hot. He looked at me and smiled lightly. \"Let's just get this over with shall we?\" He squeezed my hand reassuringly, \"just follow my lead.\" I nodded, hopefully nothing went wrong, but again; who was I kidding? Once we reached the edge of the cliff, Sean let go of my hand and an empty, pathetic feeling filled my heart. Why was my heart aching so? Sean looked at the rocks that were in front of him. He took one step back and jumped to the first one. I felt my heart race, like it was going to come out of my chest. Sean sighed once his legs stopped shaking and looked back at me. \"Okay, once I jump to the next rock; you jump to the one I'm standing on okay?\" I tried to nod my head, but it just came out as a hyperactive, compulsive shake. Sean's eyes showed worry, but jumped to the next rock. Just like the first rock, he was shaky at first, but slowly regained his control. It was my turn now. I walked backwards a good three or four steps, closed my eyes and just concentrated on my breathing. I started counting backwards and slowly opened my eyes. I started running forwards and took a leap of faith. I wasn't as graceful as Sean; I landed on my hands and knees making the rock lurched forward and crash into Sean's rock. \"Shit!\" I screamed as Sean's rock moved farther away from me, he was gripping the rock with his hands so tightly his knuckles were turning white. My rock slowly started turning upside down. I heard Sean scream: \"Hold on tight!\" All I could do was do what he said. I closed my eyes as I felt my body being flipped upside down. I didn't look for a good minute, then I could feel my muscles slowly weaken. \"Sean! I can't hold on anymore!\" \"Move your body forward! The momentum will help the rock flip over!\" I opened my eyes for a split second and noticed he was safely on the other side. The rocks all piled over on his side; how was I going to get over? Better yet, was I going to die here? I lurched my body forward, just like Sean had said, and the rock slowly flipped over. She was more than half way there. \"Now what?\" She screamed at Sean, obviously afraid. \"Paddle?\" That was actually a smart idea. I started \"paddling\" the air with my hands. My forearms were sore, but I had finally reached the other side and with Sean's help, I was up on my feet. Though I told him we couldn't more for a while. \"Why not?\" \"My legs are about ready to give out you dunce.\" Sean chuckled lightly, \"Ah.\" AN: Holy crap! Long time no see! (Or no update in this case) I'm so sorry! Really! I've been busy with other stories and other ideas ( and school obviously ) so I really didn't have time to update one of my most viewed stories! But now that I've got a chance to update, I did! It might be short, but it moves along with the plot and more are soon to come! Possibly in the next couple hours, so keep your eyes peeled!

JOURNEY 2: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND DID HAPPEN… And yes Sean did meet Kailani , and yes they are now a couple, just like in the movie SEAN'S POV \"To the earth to the moon? Seriously grandpa?\" I asked my grandfather. Kailani chuckled and looked at us in disbelief. I heard a knock on the door. I went and opened it,Trevor and Hannah. I raised a brow... Where's Alyssa? I mean, she lives with them. Guess she didn't want to come… \"Happy Birthday Sean!\" Trevor said, hugging me; he had a worried face. Hannah had a worried face too. \"Hey Trevor\" I said. \"Hey Hannah!\" She hugged me but still had a worried face. I raised a brow. My grandfather came and hugged Trevor. Kailani walked to me and wrapped her arms around my shoulders. Hannah scowled looking at her, and then she looked at meHank came and looked at Trevor. \"Hello, I'm Hank. Sean's step father\" Hank said offering a hand to Trevor. It was a bit funny, since Hank was way taller than Trevor. \"I'm Trevor… Sean's uncle\" He said and shook Hank's hand. My mum came and greeted Hannah and Trevor. Trevor looked at Kailani raising a brow. \"Oh hm yeah. Trevor this is Kailani, my girlfriend, Kailani, this is Trevor my uncle.\" I said and gulped, I know Trevor was on Alyssa's side, and the fact of me having a new girlfriend just doesn't help. Now Hannah looked at her. \"And Hannah, this is Kailani. Kailani this is Hannah, Trevor's wife\" I said. \"Hello!\" Kailani said with a smile and laughed, I hated her laugh it was just annoying, wait… I can't think that about my girlfriend. Trevor faked a smile and looked at the other way as if he was scared. Hannah kept looking away biting her lip. \"Is everything okay Hannah?\" I asked her. She hesitated. \"Er... It's just… Yeah\" She said. \"Alright…\" I said. \"Alyssa is lost!\" She said almost crying. My eyes widened. \"She is what?\" I asked. Trevor sighed. \"She is lost. We haven't known anything from her since two weeks ago. All we know is that she went to Alaska and then dissapeared\" Trevor said. My heart sank. No. She couldnt be lost. \"Who's Alyssa?\" Hank asked. \"Sean's ex-girlfriend\" My mom said. I felt Kailani's arms letting me go. \"We need to go and look for her\" I said. \"That's the reason of why we came here\" Trevor said. So… You guys didn't come to celebrate my birthday? Nice … \"We have her notebook… But we don't really understand it\" Trevor continued. \"We thought you could help us\" He said and gave me a little turquoise notebook. I smiled slightly… I gave her that notebook. I opened it and saw many annotations here and there… I started to read it. It said… \"Island of the lost dreams… Destroyed in 1800. Island created on 1700…\" I kept trying to decipher Alyssa's annotations and clues. \"Only way to find it: Time travel\" My heart sank again. It's impossible to time travel… I kept reading it. \"1750… Go to the Alaska… End of the world\" End of the world? 1750? I raised a brow. \"She wanted to time travel… It says to the end of the world… In 1750?\" I said. They all looked at me confused. \"But the world didn't end in 1750.\" Hank said. My grandfather frowned. \"I think she means… Where did they think that the world ended in 1750?\" My grandfather asked. \"In the north pole?\"I asked. \"But still… Maybe she is… freezed\" Kailani said. Gee thanks for your optimism. I kept reading . \"Time travel: Electronic devices... End of the world, sunset, storm\" I sighed. \"Let's go to Alaska\" I said and went straight to my room, starting to pack. Kailani followed me. \"Sean, what are you doing?\" She asked me. \"Packing\" I answered in a monotone voice. \"For what?\" She asked me. \"For going to Alaska and look for Alyssa\" I said still packing not paying attention to her. \"You are looking for your ex-girlfriend?\" She asked. I sighed, it sounded wrong. I looked at her. \"You can come with me if you want\" I said, she frowned and crossed her arms. \"But… Sean we nearly died in the mysterious island. I don't want to go on a crazy trip again, and perhaps… Seriously? Looking for your ex-girlfriend?\" She said, well she is dating and Anderson. What did she expect? Yes I'm looking for Alyssa, I still love her. She broke up with me 2 and a half years ago, and I still love her. \"Look, I know it sounds wrong. But trust me I'm just going because of Trevor. Trevor er.. Really likes her, and Hannah too. And don't you want to go on another adventure with your boyfriend?\" I asked her. She sighed. \"Fine.\" She said rolling her eyes, I smiled walk over to her and kissed her. \"Thanks\" I said. I walked downstairs with a suitcase and my backpack. Hank looked at me. \"Can I talk with you in the kitchen Sean?\" He asked me, I nodded and walked to the kitchen, Hank following me. \"Please let me go to Alaska and look for her, is all I ask for\" I told him, he shook his head. \"Sean, you won't go alone. I'll go with you. While you were packing I talked with your mom. She said that girl was really important to you\" He said. I nodded. \"So… It will be You, Trevor, Hannah, Grandpa, Kailani and me\" I said. He raised a brow and chuckled. \"What?\" I asked. \"You are taking your girlfriend to save your ex-girlfriend?\" He asked me chuckling. \"Look, I don't want her to come… But if she does come… Alyssa will see her and Alyssa will be jealous\" I said, Hank shook his head. \"Now what?\" \"You are playing with Kailani's heart?\" He asked me. Pfft. Kailani doesn't love me, she just loves the 'making out' sessions. I sighed and chuckled. \"Well… I actually started to date her to forget Alyssa… I mean I like her… But she is nothing compared to Alyssa\" I said. Yes, Kailani was sexy… With her curves, her plumped lips and… Well that's all Kailani has. In other hand… Alyssa, is beautiful, she is kind… Her pink lips, her gray eyes… Her read hair. She is just perfect, but I let her go. \"Well I think it didn't work… Because you are going to risk your life for her\" He said. He was right. \"I guess not, but I am still looking for her. I know she doesn't feel the same for me. But I just can't afford to think that she is lost.\" I said. Hank nodded. \"Well… Then Let's go to Alaska\" He said. A/n: Tadaaaaaah! EEEP!

I would have sat with Kailani, but the seats were arranged that way. Hank, Kailani and my grandfather were two seats behind us. I sighed. I hoped Alyssa was okay, she is the most intelligent girl I've ever met so I know she was, but still, I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I opened her notebook, I loved her handwriting, it was everything upside down but it still impressed how intelligent she was. \" Alaska- Kodiak port. End of the world \" \"She went to the Kodiak port\" I said, Trevor raised a brow and nodded. \"Alright then we'll go to the Kodiak port\" he said. I kept reading with a small smile in my face. Then I read something… \"I met you on January 1, With the moon on my nose And as I saw you were sincere In your eyes I lost That awkward distraction And that sweet sensation And now we walk through the world As Aeneas and Benitin I found you several scratches You did out there But my crazy love It is your best doctor I will heal the soul in mourning I'll leave as new And everything will happen Soon you will see the sun shine You of all people deserve to be happy You'll see as they heal Gradually your wounds You'll see how it goes The very life to decant the leftover sea salt And though you were a stranger even in your own country If I tell you how sayest thou? You still say 'What do you say? And hearing a cry of excitement bandoneon And though you seem confused with that lazy walk I know the reason that your heart hurts So I wanted to make this song You'll see as they heal Gradually your wounds You'll see how it goes The very life to decant the leftover sea salt\" I sighed as I finished reading that. I closed the notebook and looked at the window. I knew she wrote it for us, wounds? Sea salt? January 1…I met her on January 1. Jesus, the way that girl can get into my heart is just incredible. I wanted to cry. I think Trevor noticed it. \"What's the problem ' kiddo' ? Trevor asked me. I frowned, just Alyssa called me like that. \"Nothing, it's just that her notes are difficult to understand, why is she so complicated?\" I asked frowning. Trevor rolled his eyes. \"The most complicated girls are the most interesting\" He said. I rolled my eyes, he obviously is on her side. \"How did you meet that Kaila or Nakili or whatever girl?\" He asked me. I chuckled. \"In the mysterious island… Well at Palaus, but she came with me to the mysterious island\" I simply said. Hannah's eyes widened. \"You went to mysterious island without us?! How could you?\" She said as if she was mad. I shrugged and chuckled. \"Flight 394 Dayton-Alaska. Landing\" The woman on the plane said. I sighed. \"So… We are here at Alaska. Now what?\" Kailani asked. It was hot, no don't go with the stereotype of Alaska-COLD, I swear it was hot, not really hot, but it was hot. We were in Kodiak port. There were many people with boats. I looked at all. \"We need to ask if someone had seen Alyssa\" I said, and looked around. \"Uh-huh and how are we doing that? Did someone bring a picture?\" Hank asked. Well… I have a picture in my cellphone, but it is from the last time I saw her, she was sixteen so I don't know if it would help that much. \"Hm. I have one but she is sixteen, and well now she is 18, I don't think it would help\" I said, Hannah sighed. \"Well we can show them the picture and describe her\" She said. We went and started to ask people if they had seen Alyssa, they all said 'No' or shook their head shrugging. We kept asking almost all of the people in there. I sighed, I thought there wasn't more people to ask but then I saw a weird man; he was dressed as if he was going to assist to a LMFAO party; his brunette hair looked as if a monkey lived on it, he had blue eyes, and a beard . He was beside a little shack, outside the shack, there was a little red boat. I pointed at him and they all looked at me as if I was crazy or something. But who knows? \"Hello guys! Welcome to Kodiak, m'name is Steve\" He said, he had a weird voice too, let's say it wasn't that masculine. I tried not to laugh so I just snorted. \"Oh um, hey… We were wondering if you have\" I started. \"Yes m'boy I have a boat! I can show you the beautiful land of Alaska, but not today, today their having a figh up there\" He said and pointed at the sky, I guess he meant a storm was comming. \"Tomorrow would be good!\" He said nodding. \"No sir thanks. We were wondering if you have seen this girl\" I said showing him the picture. \"She is like 5,5 inches. Redhead, gray eyes, and…\" I was just going to say beautiful, but supposedly I got over her, so… \"And we are looking for her\" I finished. \"I think I've … Wait… A minute\" He said and got into the shack. I raised a brow. \"So… Do we always have to bump into weird guys?\" Hank asked with a chuckle. Yeah I know what he means. Kailani's dad was weird. Whoops I think she got that…. Kailani frowned. \"What was that supposed to mean?\" She asked still scowling. \"He means that we always bump into weird guys before finding the right one.\" I said trying to calm her down. \"Oh…\" She said. The weird man got out of the house, he wasn't alone, a 20 years old ish guy came out, Kailani's eyes widened looking at him, I looked at Hannah and she cracked a smile also looking at the guy. He had blue see eyes, wavy brunette hair, he had a muscular body… And well I guess a girl would think he was 'perfect'. I rolled my eyes looking at him, he was carrying a package. Steve came. \"Is someone in here… T. or S. Anderson?\" He asked. I nodded. T. I think it meant Trevor, and S… Well Sean Anderson, \"That would be me, I'm S. Anderson\" I said. He smiled. \"Charlie! It's them! It's them! Oh yes the ginger girl left this to you!\" Steve said. The guy, whose name I think it's Charlie. \"Oh, this is my little brother Charlie! We are identical aren't we?\" Steve asked. I snorted.. Not really… \"Guess this is for you\" He said and gave me the package, it was heavy. How come this Charlie guy carry it and I couldn't? I left the package on the floor. I kneeled beside it, looked at it, and started to open it. Why would Alyssa leave this for Trevor and Me? My eyes widened as I saw it was a strange gray machine. There was a note inside. I took it and started to read it in my mind. Trevor stepped closer and looked at the note, I suppose reading it too. \"Dear …No… Hmm… Sean and Trevor, If you have this I guess I haven't come back. Don't worry I'm okay… Well I suppose. What Steve just gave you is a time machine. I built it. It only works once; I built one for myself, and used it. To use it you need electronic devices and a storm… I mean like you know. You need to get on the boat when a storm is starting, plug the cables of the machine to one electronic device (like a cellphone or something) and choose the date: July 14, 1750. See ya there! Yours No… Hmm… Just –Alyssa\" I sighed. \"She time traveled… And she left us this time machine\" Trevor said. \" This is the only way… And since there's a storm coming we should go now\" \"So… Hmm Steve what if we take that awesome trip around Alaska today?\" I asked with a little smile. He shook his head. \"No, I'm sorry! I won't risk my life!\" He said. \"Please! The girl who gave you this, is lost\" I said. \"The ginger girl?\" He asked. I nodded. \"I'm sorry, but I can't... I lost one boat because of that ginger girl, and I don't want to lose another\" He started, Charlie cut him off saying \"I can take you, don't worry. If that machine does work we'll be okay\" He said. I nodded. \"So hmmm… Do you have a boat for 7 people?\" My grandfather asked looking at the little red boat. \"Oh don't worry Sally can take more than 15 people\" Charlie said patting the little red boat. I snorted… The boat had a name? \"Well then let's go\" I said. A/N: So that was it... :3 REVIEW! PLEASE! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT...Oh oh oh... Well Charlie is REALLY HOT! But obviously I didnt write in there because... I mean Sean is narrating the story... And if he said that about Him.. It would be WEIRD! ;)-Minnie[Chapter 3] A/N: The third chapter... A bit short I know. But well here it is.. You guys like it? REVIEW PLEASE! Want something to happen? Any ideas? \"Sean… Are you sure it will work?\" Hank asked me. I nodded with a smile. We were on the little red boat named 'Sally'. I was trying to decipher how the time machine worked… Or how the hell did Alyssa build it? \"Of course! It's Alyssa we're talking about!\" I said. Kailani glared at me. Alright… Alright Kailani is intelligent… NOT! It started to rain My grandpa smiled and pointed to the north, I kept looking at the machine, Charlie was rowing the boat, with Hank's help. \"Look! We are near!\" My grandpa said. I raised a brow and looked where he was pointing, I didn't notice the difference so I just shrugged. \"Hey… I need a cellphone\" I said, I was not going to risk my cellphone… \"Here\" Trevor said giving me a… Brick? I raised a brow and chuckled. I realized it wasn't a brick, it was a cellphone, A BIG ONE… You know like the old cellphones. I laughed. \"Don't laugh. That baby has been with me since ten years ago and is still working\" He said. \"So what we need to…\" I started. \"Sean! HURRY! WE ARE APPROACHING!\" Hannah said pointing at the same spot my grandfather was pointing. \"Approaching to what?\" I asked. \"To the end of the world\" My grandpa said. I started to hurry, and I plugged the machine cable to Trevor's brick… I mean cellphone. It turned on, and the numbers appeared from nowhere. I chose the date July,14th 1750. Before I pressed the \"GO\" button, I stood up. Now I know why they knew we were approaching. The water ended there in a waterfall, my eyes widened. I started to hear some thunders. \"TREVOR! WHAT NOW?!\" I yelled at him. \"PRESS THE GO BUTTON!\" He yelled at me I nodded, and pressed the button. The water fall started to pull us with it. We all screamed. I grabbed Kailani's hand and pulled her closer. I wrapped my arms around her waist as we were falling. I saw a green light. I felt my head hitting something. Everything was dark. I opened my eyes. I was on a little red boat. Kailani was beside me, unconscious. I looked around and saw Trevor, Hannah, Hank, Charlie and my grandfather still 'sleeping'. There was the blue sea surrounding us. I sat up, and saw a little blue boat near… but a bit far from us… There was someone inside… But I couldn't exactly see who was the person. I felt Kailani starting to move. Kailani sat up and rubbed her eyes. She looked at the blue boat and raised a brow. \"Sean… Honey where are we?\" Kailani asked…Uh-huh since when did she call me honey? Hannah woke up and sat up. She looked around confused. \"Hmm…\" I started \"That I don't know…\" I said. My grandfather woke up. Hank did too. \"Well…Well well… Where did we land?\" Hank asked. I shrugged and shook my head. I pointed at the blue boat. Hank looked at it. My grandfather started to shake Trevor. \"Wake up! Trevor! You are not a child anymore!\" he said. \"Five minutes more…\" Trevor mumbled; I rolled my eyes with a chuckle. My grandfather shook him more and Trevor woke up. \"Okay… Okay!\" There was only one person missing… Charlie. Personally I DON'T CARE… But as I saw… Kailani did, she poked his cheek. \"Wake up sleepyhead\" Kailani said, and Charlie opened his blue eyes. Kailani smiled and I rolled my eyes. Charlie sat up, and looked around. \"Where are we?\" He asked. I rolled my eyes. \"Well if you had been woken before you would have known that we don't know where we are\" I said. He raised a brow. \"There's a boat on there…\" I said pointing at the blue boat. \"Let's check it\" I said. \"We lost the rowing in the waterfall\" Hank said looking around. \"We can paddle\" Hannah said. I nodded and there we are… Paddling to approach to the boat. When we arrived, I was looking at the sea. I looked at Trevor and Hannah who were both smiling looking at the boat with widen eyes. I raised brow. I leaned to see what was on the boat. I saw a girl, dressed with a blue shirt, blue jeans and boots. She had red hair and long black eyelashes, pink lips, and little hands. Alyssa. My eyes widened as I looked at her. She was more beautiful than she ever was. Trevor jumped into the blue boat. He shook Alyssa. She moaned and slapped Trevor. \"Let me sleep! I don't want to go to school!\" She said. I chuckled. Kailani was glaring at me. Hannah jumped on the other boat. \"Wake up sleeping beauty!\" Hannah said poking Alyssa's shoulder. \"No.\" Alyssa said. I sighed and jumped on the boat. \"Sean what are you doing?\" Kailani asked me. \"Waking her up\" I said and started to tickle Alyssa. Alyssa started to giggle. \"No! Stop it! Alright! Alright! I'll wake up\" She said and opened her gray eyes, her eyes widened as she looked at me, she frowned and slapped me. \"OUCH!\" I yelled. Jesus that girl can hit really hard. I rubbed my face, it hurt. \"What the hell are YOU doing here?!\" She yelled at me. \"Nice girlfriend of yours\" I heard Hank mumbling with a chuckle. I glared at him still rubbing my face. \"Well I happen to be here to save your life\" I said. She growled… She stood up. Trevor and Hannah hugged her. She raised a brow. \"Oh…Guess I didn't come back…Did I?\" She asked. \"Nope. You didn't\" Trevor said. Hannah and him let her go. \"Hello Alyssa! You've grown up! Last time I saw you you were 6 years old! And look at you now! A beautiful lady who loves adventure\" My grandfather said. \"Hello Mr. Anderson! Well thanks\" Alyssa said blushing. She looked really cute… I sighed, she hates me. \"So… Who are these?\" Alyssa asked gesturing towards Hank and Kailani. She looked at Charlie (who had been looking at her all the time) and her eyes widened, she smiled, and blinked. \"Hello! I'm Alyssa! Pleasure to meet you\" She said offering a hand. He smiled… And checked her up. I rolled my eyes. They shook hands. \"Well hello! I'm Charlie. The pleasure is mine.\" Charlie said and kissed Alyssa's hand. I clenched my jaw. THAT. That was what I meant when Alyssa and I broke up… All the guys wanted to date her, who wouldn't obviously? Alyssa blushed and smiled. I looked at Kailani and Hank. DING! \"Alyssa, this is my stepfather Hank. Hank this is Alyssa\" I said. Hank smirked and I glared at him. \"Hello\" Hank said. I jumped back to the red boat. \"And this… Is my beautiful girlfriend, Kailani\" I said kissing Kailani. PERFECT TIME TO MAKE ALYSSA JEALOUS. I saw Alyssa clenching her jaw. \"Uh-huh. Whatever…\" Alyssa said. \"Hmm… Alyssa would you please answer us a question?\" Hank asked, Alyssa nodded. \"Where are we?\" Hank asked. \"Oh… That right. Well… Ladies and Gentlemen I welcome you to the 18th century!\" Alyssa said. My eyes widened. We did it. We time travelled. a/n: Yay! They found alyssa! Oh and Yes! you will see... Why alyssa wanted to go to the 18th century just wait... She will explain everything... OH AND DON'T FORGET THE SONG FROM THE LAST CHAPTER! IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT! REVIEW! -minnie[Chapter 4] A/N: OH MY I LOVED YOUR IDEA HYEJIN13570 ! So here's the 4th chapter! REVIEW! PLEASE! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE STORY! \"And how do you 'know' we are really on the 18th Century?\" Kailani asked Alyssa with an annoyed tone. Alyssa raised a brow. \"And we time-travelled to the 1750! Not the 18th century\" Kailani finished. Oh god, she is really stupid. \"Well look at the sky! It is not polluted!\" Alyssa said and made a 'DUH' face as if it was really obvious. I looked at the sky… I didn't notice the difference.\"And if you didn't know... the 1750 is thr 18th century sweetie\" Alyssa said looking at Kailani as if she was some kind of weirdo. My grandpa smiled and patted Alyssa in the shoulder. \"Well done Alyssa! Now I know why an Anderson dated you\" He said and winked at me, Alyssa frowned and crossed her arms. I looked away. \"So… We need to get going. Wait… Alyssa why did you come here?!\" Trevor asked her. She smiled \"Well… Have anyone of you guys read the book? The Island of the Lost Dreams?\" She asked. Hank, Kailani, Charlie and I shook our heads. Nope… I think that's the only book I didn't read… Because it reminded me of her. Trevor, Hannah, and my grandfather nodded. \"Oh, I know where you are going with this\" My grandfather said. I raised a brow. \"But… I'm sorry but it is very far! The Island is on Italy \" He finished. I clenched my jaw… Italy…. \"Well… I know that… And that's why we are here!\" Alyssa said. \"We are near Africa\" She said. \"Wait… That can't be. We were on Alaska! That's not possible\" Kailani said. Alyssa rolled her eyes. \"As almost as impossible as going to the center of the earth?\" Alyssa said with a smirk. \"I still don't get why we are near Africa\" Charlie said. Yeah neither do I… It is weird. \"Ooh kay… Look the end of the world… Do you guys remember the waterfall?\" Alyssa asked, we all nodded. Oh yes I do I almost died in there. \"Well when we fell in there… It took us to the opposite side of the world… That means Africa.\" Alyssa said. Oh now I get it… \"Alright… So we'd better go to Africa… And there… Wait. It is still very far… From Africa to Italy.\" Hank said. Alyssa sighed. \"I know that! That's why we are getting a ship! So let's go! Let's split! Charlie, Trevor, Hannah and me on this boat.\" Alyssa said, pointing at the blue boat. \"And Alexander, Hank, Sean and… What was your name sweetie? Kesha? Kia?\" Alyssa asked Kailani in a sarcastic tone. Kailani glared at her, Alyssa smirked. \"It's Kailani, and you are Alicia right? Or was it Alessandra?\" Kailani said scowling. Alyssa smirked again. \"Close… It's Alyssa… So Kilana, Hank, Alexander, and Sean in the red boat.\" Alyssa said. Kilana? Pfft. Charlie jumped to the blue boat. He smiled at Alyssa, she smiled back. I rolled my eyes. \"So… I'm sorry to ruin your genius plan but… How are we going to get to Africa without a rowing?\" I asked, Alyssa bit her lip. Ha, she didn't know. \"Well… Hmm… Singing\" She said. I raised a brow and chuckled. \"Singing seriously?\" I asked. We all started to laugh, she scowled. \"Trust me\" She said and sighed. I chuckled and started to sing very badly 'Row, row, row your boat'. Kailani chuckled and sang with me. Alyssa scowled. \"No! Sing... Something... Like… Hmm… If you know the song…. Sing with me.\" Alyssa said and bit her lip. She sighed and started to sing 'My jolly Sailor Bold'. My eyes widened as she started to sing. I raised a brow; I didn't know she could sing… She has a beautiful voice. Hannah started to sing with her, then Charlie… We were all singing. The water started to move. \"Boys, cover your ears. That means, Charlie, Sean, Trevor, Hank and Alexander\" Alyssa said while we were singing. I was going to cover my ears, when I heard the most beautiful voice coming from the water. I smiled slightly and looked at my left; there was a girl in there singing, she had green eyes, blonde hair, and red lips. The girl smiled at me and kept singing. More girls came from the water. I had this strange feeling… I wanted to kiss the girl… I leaned closer, I was just going to kiss her when I felt someone ripping my shirt and pulling me. \"WHAT DID I TELL YOU?\" Alyssa yelled at me. One of the girls who were under the water growled and grabbed Alyssa's wrist. She pulled her and splashed Alyssa. No! SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM! \"ALYSSA!\" I yelled. I needed to do something… And quickly! \"Those were mermaids!\" Hannah yelled. Oh so that's why… Oh…. \"I'll go and get her!\" I said. I was going to splash. \"NO! SEAN! NO!\" Trevor pulled me. \"Why not?!\" I asked… \"Look!\" Trevor said. I saw the mermaids tiding the boat to some ropes and started to swim. The boat started to move. I looked at all the mermaids… One caught my attention , it had bright red hair… and a turquoise tail. ALYSSA'S POV \"WHAT DID I TELL YOU?\" I yelled at Sean. Mermaids can seduce boys and then… EAT THEM! The mermaid grabbed my wrist, pulled me and sank me into the water. I tried to get out but the mermaid shook her head and put some kelp in my mouth. \"EAT IT!\" She said; I shook my head. She growled at me, and I ate the kelp. I suddenly started to breathe… Under water? I looked down at myself. I didn't have my blue jeans; instead I had a turquoise fish tail I smiled. The turquoise scales covered all my body. \"Would you take us to Africa?\" I told her. Oh my! Did I just talked underwater? \"Only if you promise something\" She said. I nodded. \"Protect that boy\" She said. \"Which one?\" I asked. \"The one with hazel eyes, he has the light\" She said. That would be Sean. I nodded. But why would she want me to protect him? The light? What did that mean? The mermaid nodded t all the other mermaids and gave me a rope. \"Tie it to the boat\" The mermaid told me, I nodded and I surfaced. All the mermaids did the same and tied the ropes. They didn't notice me, as I tied the rope to the boat, I tied the other side of the rope to my hand and copied the other mermaids. I swam. SEAN'S POV \"HEY! WAIT! WHERE'S THE GIRL?\" Trevor yelled at the mermaids multiple times. The red head mermaid who caught my attention before stopped and swam beside our boat. She surfaced. I smiled and looked at her. What a surprise she was turquoise her favorite color. \"Ally! You're a mermaid!\" Hannah yelled. Alyssa nodded and swam again. After 2 hours, we arrived to a beach, there was a ship on there; it was like a pirate ship. We arrived and Alyssa got out of the water. Charlie's eyes widened, I looked at her and my eyes widened too… She didn't have any clothes… But some kelps covering her more intimate parts. She realized and splashed in the water. \"ALL YOU 5 BOYS TURN AROUND!\" Alyssa yelled, I chuckled with a smirk, Trevor punched me in the arm, and I turned around. Hank, Trevor, Alexander and Charlie did too. The last one had a smirk on his face. I glared at him. \"Hmm... Er…Hannah there are some clothes in my backpack would you please give me some?\" I heard Alyssa yelling. We spent 5 minutes turned around. \"Okay you can turn around…\" Alyssa said. We turned around. She was now wearing a tank turquoise top, and some khaki shorts. She turned around and started to walk over the ship. \"Now, this baby is going to take us to Italy!\" Alyssa said climbing the ship; she looked down when she said Italy. \"Alyssa… Are you sure?\" Trevor asked. Alyssa turned around and nodded. \"Alright then… But how will you move the ship to the water?\" Hank asked. Alyssa looked at the sea, the mermaids were still there, they nodded and threw the ropes, as the ropes touched the boat; they tied around it. \"Question answered?\" Alyssa asked with a smirk. \"Guys come here!\" She yelled at us. We all started to climb the ship. When I jumped on it… I saw lots of swords and… gold. Alyssa grabbed a sword and flicked it; she also grabbed a pirate hat and put it on her head. \"Now we can go\" Alyssa said. Kailani was glaring at her. The mermaids started to swam and we were now on the blue sea. \"Thanks!\" Alyssa yelled at them. \"I swear I'll keep my promise!\" She added, the mermaids nodded with a smile and swam away. Hannah and Trevor were sailing the boat, while Hank and my grandfather were with a map, trying to tell them where to go. Charlie walked over to Alyssa and they started to talk, she was smiling all the time. I sighed, and looked at Kailani who was looking at the deep blue sea. I walked over to her \"Hey don't you love this?\" I asked Kailani. She cracked smile. \"Not really\" She said. I raised a brow. \"Why not?\" I asked her. \"Well the fact that you saw your ex-girlfriend almost naked and you keep staring at her doesn't help\" She said. Well… It wasn't my fault! \"But you know I love you right?\" I liked to her. She smiled as I wrapped my arm around her waist. She kissed my cheek. \"Sometimes I doubt it\" She said. a/n: That was it! So did you like it? REVIEW! PLEASE! -Minnie ;3[Chapter 5] a/n: I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I didn't update this weekend, but sometihng weird happened to my computer! I feel as a terrible person! Don't hate me! So here it is! I hope you like it! REVIEW! I'm sorry! We've been in this ship for two days. You may be thinking what had we been eating? Well in the ship there were a lot of coconuts. Alyssa has being talking with Charlie, she hasn't stopped smiling since they first met. Something normal, he is really worth for what she deserves. When she doesn't talk with Charlie she is constantly reading her book, and writing stuff in her notebook. Right now she is talking with my grandfather, they are both looking at a map and pointing at random spots in the ocean. Kailani has been really um... How do I explain...? well let's say she has been really kissable. She kisses me every time I look at Alyssa, or every time Alyssa looks at me. Trevor and Hank had been talking about how Trevor, Hannah, Alyssa and I went to the center of the earth, or how hank, kailani, my grandpa, Kailani's dad and I went to the mysterious island. Hannah has being talking with me, she is worried about Alyssa, she says that since we broke up, she has been the most quiet girl ever, something weird on Alyssa. but she also told that Alyssa is normally on parties or going out with friends... That's what worries me. \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Italy!\" Alyssa said, we finally arrived. Wow, Italy on the 18th century Is different. \"now what?\" Kailani asked. \"We need to get some clothes\" Alyssa answered. True if they saw us dressed like this, they would think we are weirdos. \"But how?\" I asked. Alyssa looked around. She bit her lip and started to dig through her backpack; she got a dark blue blanket out and she wore it as a cloak. She reminded me a bit of Merida from Brave, I mean her curly red hair, and the dark blue cloak, yep she reminded me of Merida. \"there should be a clothe shop in there, I'll go and buy some\" she said. \"you're not going alone I'll go with you\" Charlie said,Alyssa smiled and nodded; I frowned. \"No. I'll go, you need to know what size we need\" I said, Alyssa snorted and chuckled. \"You?\" She asked almost laughing. \"What's the difference? You don't know any!\" \"Well, I know Kailani's\" I said with a smirk, Alyssa clenched her jaw and rolled her eyes. \"Alright you will come, and yeah I think I memorized Charlie's too\" Alyssa said with a smirk. Now I was the one who clenched my jaw. \"Here put it on\" she said throwing a green blanket, I put it on as a cloack. \"Wait. How are we going to pay?\" I asked. Alyssa dig in her backpack again and got a tiny diamond, I raised a brow, I guess it was from our little journey. She started to climb out of the ship. I copied her. When we got to the ground she covered herself with the blanket. \"Um Al, may I ask why do we need the clothes? I mean are we going somewhere else?\" I asked her. She turned around and looked at me with her gray eyes. \"Because if we are going to deal with pirates we need to dress like them\" she said and kept walking. I grabbed her wrist to stop her. PIRATES? \"Pirates?!\" I asked with widen eyes. She nodded. \"Yes we can't go in that ship, we need to get another. A little one. \" she said, she kept walking, I was still grabbing her wrist. \"And to get the ship we need to deal with the pirates right.\" I said and grabbed her hand squeezing it. She pulled her hand away and stopped crossing her arms. \"What the hell are you doing kiddo?\" She asked me raising a brow. \"what?\" I asked innocently. \"Sean. Look stop it. We broke up years ago\" she said. I sighed. \"can't we be friends?\" I asked her, she shook her head. \"Why not?\" I asked her. \"I said no\" she said and walked looking around. Why not? the last time that we tried to be... Oh. The last time we tried to be friends, we endep up dating... I still dont get why is that bad. Who wouldnt like to date me? She looked at a random manand asked him \" Mi scusi, dove si trova un negozio di abbigliamento?\" I raised a brow. I don't know what that meant. I dot speak Italian, Alyssa does, her mother is Italian but me? Why would I know how to speak Italian? \"la strada successiva a destra\" The man answered her. She smiled and nodded \"hey kiddo, come here\" she said and walked to the first street at right. \"what did you ask him?\" I asked her. \"Where the shop was\" she said. Oh... We entered to a little shop, there were a lot of clothes on there. There was a petite woman on there, I supposed she was a weaver. \"Bongiorno! la bella signora era alla ricerca di un abito da sposa di sposare questo bel giovanotto?\" The woman asked looking at us. Alyssa's eyes widened as she shook her head. ALYSSA'S POV \"Bongiorno! la bella signora era alla ricerca di un abito da sposa di sposare questo bel giovanotto?\" the woman asked me... wait that means Bongiorno! the beautiful lady was looking for a wedding dress to marry this handsome young man? NOOOO! My eyes widened and I shook my head. No I wasn't going to marry Sean. Sean? Handsome? Well yes... REALLY handsome...With his hazel eyes, his lips, his nose... His jaw, that perfect jaw. But no I wouldn't marry him, he was a jerk, and I don't know if I feel the same. And he doesn't 'love' me or 'like' me anymore, he is with Kailani, that bitch. I need to tell her that we need some clothes. \"What?\" Sean asked. No I wasn't going to tell him. \"Oh! So you're from my country! Are you from England too?\" The woman asked with a British accent. I nodded with a smile and elbowed Sean, he nodded too. \"Excellet! So is this beautiful lady looking for a wedding dress to marry this young and handsome man?\" The woman asked, Sean chuckled andshook his head. \"No, ma'am. We were just looking for some normal clothes. \" Sean said imitating a British accent. \"Oh! Well I don't have any right now! But I can make you some for next week!\" She said, I looked around and saw there were some clothes perfect for us. \"um what about those?\" I said pointing at it. \"Well those are for the emperor... You can take then but you will need to pay a lot of money\" she said, I showed her the diamond \"will this make it?\" I asked she nodded with her widen eyes. \"Take them! I can make more!\" She said and gave Sean all the clothes. SEAN'S POV \"Take them! I can make more!\" She said hugging the diamond, and gave me all the clothes \"Thanks Um. Ma'am may I ask Why are you here in Italy?\" I asked the woman. Alyssa raised a brow. \"Well, as a weaver I didn't have many oportunities in England. But here! People come and buy clothes everyday!\" She said. I nodded. \"But why are you guys in here?\" she asked us. Shit. Shit shit. What should we tell her? Alyssa! Think of something and quick! \"Well, we are bakers! And they told us that they needed bakers here in Italy!\" Alyssa said. Bakers? Me? BAKING BREAD? HA! I nodded. \"I don't know if there is any bakery in here... But in Rome there certainly is!\" She said. \"Then we'll better get going off to Rome! Thanks ma'am\" Alyssa said smiling to the woman, she gestured to the door, and we walked out of the shop. We walked together. \"Want some help?\" She asked me, I shook my head. \"Are you sure kiddo?\" She asked me again, but before I could shake my head she grabbed almost all the clothes, leaving me with just 2 shirts and a pair of boots. \"Al, I said I'm fine\" I said taking all the clothes again. She scowled, as we kept walking. I wanted to Show her that I can be as strong as Charlie. We arrived to the ship and gave everyone their clothes. We took turns to put the clothes on in the Captain's cabin. \"Let's go and look for the Pirate zone\" Alyssa said. She was wearing black boots, black pants, a pirate blouse and a black vest. She put on the pirate hat again. \"Pirate zone?\" Hank asked. He was dressed kinda like Jack Sparrow. Which was really funny. Alyssa nodded with a smile. I was wearing some black pants, boots, and a white shirt. \"Yes! We need a little ship, not as big as this one.\" Alyssa said. \"Wait. We just came here to save you. Which is done. I don't care if you want to go to your dreamy island, we need to come back to our time.\" Kailani said, she was kinda dressed as Alyssa, but in brown boots brown pants and without a vest. Alyssa rolled her eyes. \"Well... The only way to come back is in the Island. That's why we are going there. DUH!\" Alyssa said. \"What's on the island?\" Charlie asked. \"You will see... You will see\" Alyssa said with a smile. a/n: Tadah... Did you like it? REVIEW PLEASE! -Minnie ;3[Chapter 6] a/n: sorry I havent been updating but I havent had time! Just a lot of homework and projects and exams and ahhhh! I'm going crazy! But here it is! There is a mysterious character... dun dun dun! I hope you like it oh and REVIEW! \"Alright, everyone get off the ship! We are going to the pirate zone walking!\" Alyssa said, she grabbed a sword. We all nodded and starte to climb off the ship. \"Do I look as a pirate?\" Kailani asked me. I smiled and nodded. \"Yes as a beautiful one\" I said. Alyssa snorted. \"So... Let me ask where the pirate zone is\" Alyssa said. Her boots were a bit high, and well I guess she didn't know how to walk with heels, because when she was walking she constantly stumbled. I chuckled looking at her. We started to walk. Alyssa in the front. The people were all happy, it seemed to be a happy place. \"Mi dispiace ... Dove si trova la zona dei pirati?\" Alyssa asked a man, who seemed to be apirate. The man looked at her with widen eyes. \"Ha. Now everyone can be a pirate. Sei un pirata?\" The pirate asked Alyssa. She nodded with a confident smile. \"Yes, m'lord. I'm a pirate. So what?\" Alyssa asked. \"Oh so yeh talk english? Yer a pirate? A pirate girl?\" The pirate asked laughing. \"Yes. And I'm a Captain. Captain Evans for you!\" Alyssa said. The pirate laughed even more. \"Oh and where's yer crew Captain Evans?\" The pirate asked. \"Oh... Er.\" Alyssa started. \"Here! Here we are!\" I said pointing at everyone. The pirate chuckled, then Hank stood infornt of him and the pirate's face paled as he gulped. \"Alright, alright. I'll take you to to the pirate zone... Come come here!\" The pirate said and started to walk. We followed him. We went through many streets, until we arrived to a port, a dark one. We entered to a type of bar... With lots of pirate, ... well drunk pirates. Everyone started to look at us. \"So... Is there any ship on sale?\" Alyssa asked. They all looked at her and laughed. \"I asked something. Is there any ship for Captain Evans?\" Alyssa asked again. She had her hand on the sword she got in the ship. \"Well... If yeh have some gold. There surely is\" A pirate said. He was a really strange pirate... He reminded me a bit of...Captain Jack Sparrow? I thought... He wasn't real... But he is... and... I think Alyssa noticed it too. \"Well, I certainly do. Captain Sparrow\" Alyssa said. The pirate smirked. \"And how. May I ask does this beautiful lady know my name?\" The Captain asked. \"Well, I happen to be Captain Evans. Don't you know me?\" Alyssa asked. I looked at Hannah, and Trevor. They were as astonished as I was. Kailani, as always had her 'I don't believe it' face, what a surprise. Charlie had a smile, and Hank was looking at Jack.. Captain Jack. My grandfather had a smirk on his face. \"Well... I don't Miss Evans, but I have a deal for ya. Can we talk in private?\" The Captain Sparrow asked, and gestured to another table. Alyssa nodded and sat with him in the table he showed. They started to talk, Alyssa was really a good actress... Which is somehow good and somehow bad. Because I can't really notice what she feels for me, or anything. \"So. Basically Alyssa is solving EVERYTHING\" Trevor said, as we sat on a table. \"And there are also some people who don't really help\" He continued and glanced to Kailani, and Charlie. I agree with him, they have nothing to do in here. \"Well, she is an intelligent girl what did you expect?\" Hannah said. \"And she dated an Anderson... It is logicall\" My grandfather said. Granpa please... Would you please stop with that? \"Anyway... Did you guys see that that was Jack...Jack Sparrow?\" Charlie asked. Hank nodded. \"Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow\" I said and chuckled. That was clear for me from the movies... \"Yes. I thought that dude was fictional... But it seems not\" Kailani said. \"Well... Nothing is impossible. I mean everyone thought that Jules Verne wrote FICTION\" I said. My grandfather nodded. \"But... He actually seems to be like... The same as in the movies.\" Kailani said. I nodded. \"As I said before. Everything is possible\" I said again. But... Maybe he was Johnny Depp. Or I dont know. Someone patted my shoulders. I tourned around, It was Alyssa who was smiling, she seemed proud of herself. \"Well... We have a ship\" She said still with a smile. \"And another captain\" The Captain Sparrow said. \"Oh yes... About that. He is coming with us\" Alyssa said. Jack Sparrow with us? Man this is going to be a funny trip. \"We need to go to the north!\" Jack said. \"No! It's to the south! According to the book...\" Alyssa started. I rolled my eyes. They've been arguing for the last few hours. They are annoying. \"Are they going to stop someday?\" Charlie asked me with a chuckle. I chuckled and shook my head. \"I hope so. I'm getting annoyed\" I said, he chuckled. \"So, what's going on between you and Alyssa?\" Charlie asked me. I looked away... Did he mean why did we always looked at each other with resentment? \"Um... Nothing. Why?\" I asked. \"Dude, I'm not stupid. Look, I know you are dating Kailani, but the way that you look at Alyssa tells me there is something between you guys\" He said. Wow he is very observant. \"Dude she is my ex-girlfriend\" I said. \"And there's nothing\" I said. I bit my lip. I wish there was something though. \"Oh... So Now I get the tension\" He said. I chuckled and nodded. \"Yup. So... You like her huh?\" I asked him. I needed to know... I am still the jealous guy of always. \"Well... She is a really pretty girl. So that would be a yes\" He said. I clenched my jaw. \"I guess so. Why don't you go for her?\" I asked him. Bitch, you try to do something, consider yourself dead. \"Are you sure dude? I don't want any problems\" He said. I rolled my eyes. Don't go for her, don't go for her she is mine. Not yours, MINE. \"Yep. I'll just warn you something. She is REALLY stubborn, and complicated\" I said. \"Alright. I'll try something\" He said. Fuck you Charlie. But if I still know Alyssa, she won't really pay attention to him, she likes challenges, something to fight for, she doens't like easy things. \"Hey Sean\" Trevor said. I turned around and looked at him. \"Hey.\" I answered with a monotone voice. \"Excited?\" He asked me, I shrugged and looked back at the sea. \"Sean look. Maybe you are mad at me, but you should understand that she was right.\" Trevor said. Oh no, not again , please not now. \"She was right?\" I asked annoyed. \"Breaking up with me because I was jealous?\" \"Well, it wasn't the first time Sean, and you were bad with her! So you can have some friends who are girls, but she can't have some guy friends?!\" Trevor asked me. \"Look Trevor, that was between Alyssa and me. And I don't want to argue now for a fucking stupid thing okay?\" I said. \"Fucking stupid thing Sean?\" Alyssa asked, she was behind us, I didnt even notice when she arrived. God, I did not say that... Shit. \"So we were just a 'fucking stupid thing' huh?\" She asked. \"Alyssa I didn't mean...\" I started, but she was already gone. God, why does she always missunderstands everything? \"Nice one huh?\" Trevor said and was gone too. I rubbed my eyes withmy hands. Alyssa is with Jack, near the helm, looking at a map. She hasn't even looked at me. \"We are approaching, you guys should start thinking on good things\" My grandfather said. \"Good things?\" Kailani asked. \"Yes, the island is constantly changing... It transforms depending on their surrounding, if we are the island, the island creates withs our most terrible nightmares, our most precious memories, our lost dreams... Everything we think or dream\" Hannah answered. Precious memories?... \"And if someone sleeps in the island... The island shows their dreams\" Trevor continued. \"So... If we have dreamt with a horrible hmm Dinosaur it will appear?\" Charlie asked; Hannah nodded. \"Woah... It seems a funny island huh?\" Hank asked with a smile. \"It certainly is.\" Alyssa said, obviously not looking at me. \"Have you been there Sparrow?\" Alyssa asked Jack, Jack smirked. \"Well... I've heard of it. And they say it is the most beautiful... and scary island. I just hope there's rum\" Jack answered. We chuckled. \"Well... Keep dreaming on it and there will certainly appear\" My grandfather asnwered him. \"Oh look... I think I can see it!\" Alyssa said and pointed at an island. a/n: So... that was the chapter... Sorry if it is short! But I havent had any time for writing! I hope you liked it... And well yeah Jack Sparrow is in there :3. I know that it is random... But he will make the story funnier I swear. REVIEW! -minnie P.S: SORRY FOR THE BAD WORDS[Chapter 7] a/n: Here's the seventh chapter! I hope you like it... Oh and I'm wrting a josh hutcherson fanfic! s/8754704/1/Don-t-you-know-me-A-Josh-Hutcherson-fanfic here's the link So... tadaaaah... I looked at Alyssa, she had a tear on her face, but she was smiling. We finally arrived; I looked around at the island. \"Ladies and gentelmen, I give you... The Island of the Lost Dreams\" Alyssa said. It was just incredible, we constantly saw things appearing and dissapearing. I looked at my left and I saw a buttefly changing its colors. \"This is just... Amazing\" I said, everyone nodded. I looked at my left, Jack was there. \"Now. Where's the rum?\" Jack asked. Suddenly a rum bottle appear from nowhere. Jack smirked at started to drink the bottle. \"Before you drink that Jack. We need to divide into groups\" Alyssa said. I raised a brow. I looked back at my left and I saw that Jack was gone. \"Wait where's Jack?\" I asked. Alyssa bit her lip. \"That. We can't... Really stay that much on a place... And don't get that much in the island temptations\" Alyssa said. \"So... It will be in pairs. But in each pair we need to have someone who has read the book\" She continued. \"There are 6 parts in the island; The nightmare zone, I hope we don't get in there; the fantasy dreams, the most incredible, we are in here right now; the real dreams, the most real dreams, they don't have anything unusual; the wise dreams, those dreams that always teach something; the memories treasure, which is the most tricky part of the island, and... the wish waterfall, that's why we need to divide, if one of us get to the wish waterfall, they will drink of it and wish we appear there... and I'll wish... I mean then we'll wish to come back to our time\" Alyssa said... So she wants to wish something. \"So... That means I can't go with Sean?\" Kailani asked glaring at Alyssa. \"What a coincidence\" Kailani said as Alyssa rolled her eyes. \"Whatever. We can't be together... Or bad things will happen. Now, Hannah. Who do you want to go with?\" Alyssa asked Hannah, ignoring Kailani's glare. Hannah looked at the ones we havent read the book. \"Kailani will come with me... We'll go to the north\" Hannah said. Kailani frowned. \"And we'd better get going\" Hannah said before Kailani could say anything. Trevor kissed Hannah , and Kailani walked over to me, she glared at Alyssa with a smirk and then kissed me. She walked over to Hannah and then they went straight to the north. Now they were gone. \"Alexander, choose\" Alyssa said. My grandfather looked at Hank. \"We'll go to the North-East\" My grandfather said. Hank nodded and started to walk there \"So... Trevor and Sean. Charlie and me\" Alyssa said, I frowned, Trevor rolled his eyes. \"Nope. Charlie will come with me. Sean and you\" Trevor said to Alyssa. Alyssa scowled and shook her head. \"No, I said Charlie will come with me\" She said and grabbed Charlie's wrist. Charlie nodded. \"I'm sorry, But I can't be two minutes with Mr. Stubborn without trying to punch him in the face, so if you want Sean alive... Charlie will come with me\" Trevor saide with a smirk... Huh thanks budddy, I really appreciate that you hate me... \"Fine.\" Alyssa said... Wait what?! She said fine?! She let Charlie's wrist go. \"Hey, Lee, um.. Take care of yourself\" Charlie said at Alyssa, Ha. Now he has a nickname for her? Alyssa slimed and nodded. \"So do you Charlie\" She said. Ha. She doesn't like him. \"We'll take the east\" Trevor said pushing Charlie to the east. Now they were gone. Alyssa sighed rolling her gray eyes. I looked at her, she turned around and started to walk to the west; I stared at her for a while then I realised wshe I started to run 2\"So... You don't want me to die huh?\" I tease, she turned around and stopped, as I was running I tripped with her and fell above her... This... Reminds me of something... \"Get off me kiddo\" She said... and tried to push me. This. I know this happened before... I stood up and helped her. \"I'm sorry... But... Don't you think... This\" I started to but she cut me off. \"Yes. We went to the memories treasure\" She said. I looked around... \"What does that mean?\" I asked her. She sighed. \"That means... We will... Hmm... I don't really know. Verne didn't explain about this part, he just wrote that fascinating things will happen... But are most... Dangerous.\" She said. \"Dangerous?\" I asked her, she bit her lip. \"Yes... We can't... Because the memories will return... Like history will repeat... And... Well... it is dangerous at least for us\" She said. \"So... It can happen anything that we lived together?\" I asked her, she sighed and nodded. \"Most likely yes. Which is... Ugh, great just great.\" She frowned and kept walking. I walked with her. \"Um, Al... I just wanted to say I'm sorry... F\"id thing. Wasn't it?\" She said and kept walking. I sighed. \"You know I didn't mean that. I meant that it was stupid arguing with Trevor\" I said, she turned around. \"E 'sempre la stessa, Sean. Sempre\" She said, great she is mad again. I hate when she is mad and starts to speak italian. \"Al, please. I don't want to argue with you anymore\" I said. \"Then, why do you always give a reason to argue about?\" She asked me. \"Actually, you are the one who missunderstands everything\" I said. She frown. \"Oh do I really Sean? Do I? Am I always the bad witch of this love story?\" She said and covered her mouth. \"Love story huh?\" I teased. \"So, you still think this is a love story?\" I asked. \"It USED to be a love story. Which was a lie. So it didn't count\" She said and walked away. \"It wasn't a lie! It was real... For me at least!\" I said. Great, now I'm sounding cheesy. \"Uh huh, I guess Valerie was real too huh?\" She asked, I rolled my eyes. Wait... déjà vu. This has happened before, now I get why the island is dangerous for us, we will constantly be fighting... and kissing. Which is... confusing. \"You know Valerie and I were just friends!\" I said, I hate that she thought that I was cheating on her with Valerie; yes we dated, after... Alyssa broke up with me but that was different. \"And you did know that Louis and I were just friends! It's the same Sean!\" She yelled at me. Oh yes, old times... \"No Alyssa, he liked you! He almost kissed you once!\" I yelled at her. She was going to answer but before she could yell anything I kissed her, her gray eyes widened but she kissed me back. This is like the old times, we argued, she yelled at me, then I kissed her tu shut her up... Yeah good times. I let her go and started to walk away, she stayed there confused. I rubbed my head and... Now I had a beanie? I raised a brow, and stopped. I turned around, and saw a 13 years old Alyssa, she was wearing exactly what she wore when... oh my god. I looked around, the waterfalls, the sky... We were back in the Center of the Earth. a/n: tadaaaah! That was it... Was it cheesy? Did you guys like that there was a kiss? Hm... Review! I need to know what you guys think! -Minnie[Chapter 8] a/n: OMG I FEEL AS A CRAPPY AUTHOR! DON'T HATE ME! PLEASE DON'T! DON'T DON'T HATE ME! I LOVE YOU ALL GUYS! ITS JUST I HAD EXAMS! AND EVERYTHING WENT CRAZY! AND I HAD PROJECTS! AND I HAD DETENTION ALL THIS WEEK(don't ask. But NEVER insult Harry Potter or the Hunger Games infront of me if you like your bones complete) BUT HERE IT IS! Don't hate me please! Here! Have some cookies! *instert giving cookies to all* I looked down at my clothes and I saw I was wearing exactly the same as when I went to the center of the eart. Now I understand why this is dangerous for us, for Alyssa at me at least; not because we will be fighting, or kissing or... Whatever. No. Because we went to the center of the Earth. History will reapeat. What I don't know if Alyssa is still the 18 years old Alyssa inside, or if she is 13. \" What the hell are you doing kiddo? \" She asks me... She still calls me kiddo... But that doens't mean she is still 18. \"We freaking came back! Just think about it Sean... It's going to happen all over again! I don't know how or what will happen... But\" She started, yes she is still 18 inside. She looked at me and giggled. \"What?\" I asked, she kept giggling. \"Nothing... Just... You were so cute when you were 13, what happened to you?\" She said and took my beanie off and messed up my hair. \"Oh.. So you think I was cute huh?\" I asked her and came closer to her, she blushed and shoved me playfully. She put on my my beanie. \"Well, I did. I wouldn't have dated you if I didn't... Or would I Anderson?\" She said with a smirk on her lips. \"It all depended on you, Evans\" I said, she smiled and started to walk. \"So as far as I...\" She started but didn't finish. She was loking at the waterfall. \"What?\" I asked her and looked at the waterfall... I chuckled at what I saw, Jack. He was looking at the waterfalll with a really confused face. \"Sparrow!\" Alyssa yelled and started to walk over him, he turned around and looked at us still confused. \"Who in this world are you?\" He yelled at us. \"And what the hell are you wearing?\" \"Oh that. Right. Er... Well you know the isalnd did something to us... But it is Just Sean and me... A younger version but it is us\" Alyssa said, she bit her lip. \"Yeah. We are the same... Just smaller\" I said. Jack chuckled while looking at me. Yes. I know I didn't grow that much but... Ugh. \"Well, I believe it's a smaller version of Alyssa... But this is just the same guy just with longer hair\" Jack said laughing, I frowned. Alyssa mumbled something and then giggled. \"Oh, please. I'm not that...Well yes I'm little... I'm not that tall but who cares?\" I said. Alyssa giggled and shook her head. She patted my shoulder and chuckled again, I chuckled with her. Suddenly the earth started to move... Like an earthquake. Alyssa's eyes widened and we all crashed to the ground. Everything went dark. I woke up and looked around. An 18 years old Alyssa was still sleeping. Jack Sparrow was there with a confused face. I looked at myself; I'm 18 again. Good. I looked at my left and saw a 13 years old me... Wait what? I looked again at him, he was sleeping... Or fainted... Or whatever. He was wearing the clothes I wore in the Center of the earth. I was going to wake Alyssa up... But I looked at her left and there was a 13 years old Alyssa... So... There were two of us. One the actual and the younger version... Oh god, dealing with myself? The younger Sean started to move and moan; he woke up and looked at me...This is kinda weird. \"Um... Who are you?\" He asked me. Gosh. How do I answer that? \"Well... I'm... Er... I'm you\" I said, he raised a brow and chuckled. \"No seriously who are you?\" He asked again. \"Seriously, I'm you... But in an older version.\" I said, he bit his lip. And looked at me curiously. \"Well... Am I turning that handsome?\" He said with a chuckle. Yep, that's definately me when I was younger... \"I didn't grow that much...\" He continued \"Wait... Where's Ally?\" He asked me. I pointed at the 18 years old Alyssa... I shook my head and then pointed at the younger one. He crawled to her, but then came back. \"So... You are me... In the future?\" He asked again. Geez, I told him twice and he still doesnt get it. Was I that stupid and stubborn? \"Yes. For third time.\" I said, he smirked. \"So... Hmm Did something happpen between you know... Alyssa and me?\" He asked me. Shit. What should I tell me? I mean him... I mean... That. \"Um... You'll discover that by yourself\" I told him, he frowned, and crawled back to Alyssa, the younger one , I stood up and walked to Alyssa, the old one. I stooped beside her and started to shake her. She streched and sat up, as she sat up her head hit mine. \"Oi!\" She said opening her eyes and rubbing her head. \"Good job kiddo \" \"Sorry... Now... I have a little surprise for ya\" I said also rubbing my head. Her eyes met mine. I felt something... I looked away, and saw that the young Alyssa was still sleeping. The young me was shaking her, but she was still sleeping. \"Alyssa!\" He kept yelling. She finally woke up, and punched him in the arm. The old Alyssa was confused. The young me looked at the old Alyssa, and the young Alyssa looked at me. \"Um... Sean... Why... am I looking at myself?\" Alyssa asked me whispering in my ear. \"Oh. That. Something happened... And well... The younger version of us appeared.\"I said also whispering. \"Where are we?\" She asked me. \"Um... In the Island... Of the Lost Dreams.. But\" I started. \"Actually we are just in the center of the Earth\" The young Alyssa said. \"No... Well... Um...\" I started. \"Wait. Who in this world are you?\" The young Alyssa asked me. \"I'm... Er...\" I started but then I noticed her smile... That smile that tells me... Oh no. She likes me... The young Alyssa likes me instead of the young me. \"We are the older you\" The old Alyssa said. \"Yeah... You guys were kinda familiar.\" The young Alyssa said. The old one was bitting her lip... And rubbing her nose with her finger. \"Sean. Can I talk with you? \" The old Alyssa said. I nodded and stood up, so the younger me did. I raised a brow and looked at him. \"I think she meant me\" I said, and he nodded, he sat beside Alyssa and they started to whisper to each other. Alyssa (the older one) and I walked a bit far from them. \"They are not real\" She said. \"Yeah, I noticed that by myself , thanks\" I said a bit sarcastically. \"But they aren't just a part of the island\" Alyssa said, I had a confused face. She sighed. \"They aren't just a memory\" She continued. I raised a brow. \"What do you mean?\" I asked her. \"They... Represent... Us... Our... Mind\" She said and looked away annoyed. I still didn't understand. \"Everything they say... It's what we are thinking... Like... Not exactly what we are thinking right now... Like our deep thoughts... The ones we don't really pay attention to\" She said. I smirked, so that meant that she liked me... Or maybe not. I think she noticed my smirk, so she punched me in the arm. \"Sean, I'm serious. This could be... I don't... I just ... What if...\" She started to mumble things and to rub her hand with the other. She is worried. \"Is there something you are hiding?\" I asked her, her eyes widened as she shook her head. \"N-no-no!\" She yelled at me. \"Al, tell me. Why did you want to come to the Island of the Lost Dreams?\" I asked her. \"Um... I want to wish something\" She said. I raised a brow. She seemed to be fighting in her head with herself, like if she was deciding rather to tell me or not. \"Wish what?\" I asked her, she sighed. \"I want us together again\" a/n: So that was.. it... Yeah sorry... If it was cheesy... And... Well yeah something weird... The end... of the chapter... But... Yeah :P... I don't know why I'm wirting with... xD Well... I hope you like it...

This chapter was a bit tricky for me. But anyway here it is... I hope you like it. And thanks for keeeping with the story. Review please! -Minnie :3 \"Sean! Sean wake up!\" Someone yells at me. I find it difficult to open my eyes. Someone shakes me. \"Sean I swear if you don't wake up I'll kill you\" A familiar girl voice says. \"Yeh should try CPR\" a manly voice says. \"What?\" The girl asks. \"N-NO\" She yells. \"If yeh want him alive...\" The manly voice says. \"Yes! That would be the best! Unless he won't wake up! Please Alyssa!\" A boy says. \"And perhaps it's CPR! not A kiss\" Another girl says, this one sounds younger. \"But...\" The older girl says, \"Alright.\" I feel a pair of lips smashing into mine, I feel air and I open my eyes. The 'CPR' kinda transforms into a kiss. The girl lets me go. I rub my eyes. I see Alyssa there, beside her, Jack Sparrow, and theres a young Alyssa and a young me behind them. I cough. \"Wha-what happened?\" I asked. All I remember is Alyssa saying she wanted to get back together. \"Well... We were going to talk in there but suddenly you fainted\" Alyssa said. \"Hmm? But we did talk right?\" I ask. I remember our conversation. Alyssa shakes her head. \"Yes we did!\" I said. \"You told me that you wanted to... Um...\" I started. \"No, Sean we didn't talk... As I said we were going to talk but you fainted.\" Alyssa said. So that conversation wasn't real. I sighed. \"But... It didn't seem to be... Fake!\" I said \"Yeah, the island can make you feel that... It's the LOST DREAMS you know! \"Alyssa said sarcastically. \"Yeah I got that by myself\" I said and sat up. \"Good. Are you okay by the way?\" She asked me, I raised a brow. \"Yeah I am fine...\" I said with a monotone voice. I don't believe her, she is lying. That conversation did happen. I'm sure. \"But you hit youself with this rock\" She said poiting at a rock. \"I said I'm fine.\" I snapped at her and standed up. She scowled. \"Are you sure Sean?\" She asked me. I rolled my eyes, and then looked at her; she seemed worried. \"I'm okay Alyssa, don't worry.\" I told her. \"After that kiss who wouldn't?\" I tease with a smirk. Her eyes widened. \"I didn't kiss you\" She mumbled. I smirked. \"You did.\" The young Alyssa and I said at the same time. I looked at her raising a brow. \"I did CPR, not a kiss\" The old Alyssa said, then she started to chew her bottom lip, she does that when she is lying. \"Uhm... I know that you did kiss him\" The young Alyssa said with a smirk. \"I said I didn't\" The old Alyssa said. \"And that's not true\" \"After you knocked..\" The young Alyssa started but the old one covered her mouth. \"Can I talk with you for a minute?\" The old Alyssa asked the young one, the young one smirked and nodded. They walked to another place and I saw they started to argue. Jack, the young me, and mysel stayed there in silence. \"So... Now there are two versions. why did this need to happen to me?\" Jack said looking at the sky. \"Are we that bad?\" I asked with a chuckle. \"I had enough with one of each now two?! Why?!\"He yelled. \"I'm not that bad, I'm just saying what he is thinking... Wait that is bad\" The younger me said. I scowled at him and he laughed. \"You know ... We are really weird.\" The young me said. Jack nodded. \"And scary... And obvious\" Jack said. I raised a brow. \"Obvious?\" I asked. Jack smirked. \"You like the girl\" He answered, I felt I was blushing. I did, I really did. I rolled my eyes and shook my head. \"No, I don't that's why I have a girlfriend, duh\" I said and looked away. \"A girlfriend you are only dating to make Alyssa jealous\" The younger me said. \"Not. True.\" I said. True. I sighed. What if I haven't been that jealous? Would Alyssa and I still be together? That's a difficult question to answer, Alyssa is a really complicated girl. She can hide her emotions that well, she is a really good actress. You can't know if she is mad, happy or sad behind those pink lips, she is always smiling no matter what, she always find a reason to it,well the only thing she an't hide is when she is lying, she bites her bottom lip; she knows how to contol her hands, to never shiver, or never put her hands in fists if she is mad; the only thing that can show her emotions, her true emotions, those gray eyes show if she is happy or sad, nervous or angry, bt only if you really know her you can notice it. \"She is coming...\" Sean whispered. I looked at my left. She was coming, she rolled her eyes as she came, the younger Alyssa had a big smirk. \"Did yeh finish arguin'?\" Jack asked. The old Alyssa glared at him, the younger one shrugged with a smirk. \"Now. I don't know what's going to happen. All I know is we need to get to the waterfall\" Alyssa said. \"And where's that?\" I asked her. She shrugged and the looked away. \"Where are you going guys?\" She said raising a brow. I turned around and saw the young us running. Jack was behind them following. I shrugged and started to follow them. The island was transforming infront of us. I sighed, Alyssa was behind me. She saw how eveyrthing was transforming. Jack Sparrow looked at us and then he looked at the beach. Wait the beach? I know this beach... Just I dont know from where. I looked around to search for the young Alyssa, and the young me. I didn't see them anywhere. I looked at Alyssa and she shrugged. \"Guys...\" Jack said and sat on a rock... Then he hid . \"Come to see this\" I shrugged and I sat on the rock with him, hiding; Alyssa sat and also hid. \"What..\" I started but Jack cut me off \"Shh\" He pointed at a ranodm point. I raised a brow and looked at it. \"SEAN!\" A voice yelled multiple times. I was going to answer but someone covered my mouth; I looked at my left and Alyssa was looking down confused. The young Alyssa appeared and walked to the young me. She ran over to him and kneeled beside. Her eyes started to get wet. The young me had blood in his shirt. The young Alyssa catiously lifted the shirt, her eyes widened as she saw... What I think she saw the wound... Or my body... Or maybe both. \"Sean? Are you okay?\" She asked. The young me stretched and moaned. The young me started to opened his eyes. The young Alyssa placed his hand in the injury. I giggled a bit, her 'this is an awkward moment' face is cute. Sean started to moan. \"It's going to be okay Sean, I swear. It's going to be okay\" The young Alyssa said. The young me gasped. 'Close your eyes... Close your eyes' A voice in my head said. I nodded and closed my eyes. 'Open your eyes... Open your eyes' The voice said. I sighed and opened them, now the young Alyssa was infront of me. \"It's going to be okay... We just need to cover it with something\" She said. I looked at my left and I didn't see Jack, or me... Or anyone. \"Alyssa...I'm\" I started \"It's going to be okay Sean... I swear\" She said. \"But I'm\" I started again. I wanted to tell her that it's the old me, not the young one. 'She is the old Alyssa too... Don't ruin this' the voice in my mind said. \"Alyssa... I'm\" I started... \"it's going to be okay Sean I swear... I'm here for you\" She said. \"But I'm... \" I said but she cut me off again. \"I know! I'm doing the best\" She said trying to stop the ripped one of her short sleeves and placed it on my wound. She went running and grabbed some water with her hands. She came back to me running. She splashed the water on the wound. I moaned. Geez, that hurt. \"I know it hurts Sean but you will be fine!\" She said. \"But Alyssa...\" I started. \"I know! I'm doing my best!\" She told me. Geez, she is really stubborn \"But I'm okay!\" I managed to yell. \"No you are not okay you are freaking bleeding! You are hallucinating!\"She still trying to heal the kept going for water and wetting the wound. I kept saying I was okay. She didn't seem to care and kept bringing water and splashing it on my wound, everytime she did that it hurt like HELL. Se kept running and running for water, her hands were little so she couldnt bring a lot of water. \"Alyssa! \" I yelled at her. She looked at me, we locked eyes. \"What!?\" She yelled at me before I could say anything. \"Listen to me\" I said calmly and grabbed her hand that was stoping the blood, it wasn't bleeding anymore thought. I placed her hand on my face. I was heavily breathing. \"I'm better now, now I'm seriously okay\" I said making her hand rub my face. \"Look at it. it is not bleeding\" I said , she sighed. We stared at each other... Deja vu... This has happened before... I know! In the center of the earth... Now I'm going to do what I didn't do the last time. I sat up and kissed her on the lips. She kissed me back closing her eyes. I closed mye eys, and kept kissing her. We kissed what it seemed for hours. \"Sean. What the hell in this world are you doing?\" A girl voice said. I let Alyssa go and looked at my left. Kailani. Dun dun dun... I hope you like it... And yes the scene was from the 'Journey to the Center of the Earth' So... Hmm anyway hope you liked it. And Review! I want to know what you guys think of this story so far! Hmm... Merry Christmas? Hm.. Yeah :D :3[Chapter 10] A/N: I'm sorry I haven't been writing, its just I was grounded for... Yeah whatever here it is! I hope you guys like it! Review please! Tell me what you like... Or what you dislike! PLEASE! :D So... Hope you like it:3 \"Huh?\" I asked confused. When did she appear? \"Why the hell were you kissing that bitch ?\" Kailani asked annoyed. I looked at Alyssa, who was looking down. \"I-I-\"I mumbled. \"Don't blame him. I was the one who kissed him\" Alyssa said standing up. What? I was the one. Why is she blaming herself? Kailani glared at her. \"I don't believe you.\" Kailani said. I stood up too. I looked down and saw I was with the same clothes as when we arrived here, the pirate clothes. \"You'd better. Because it is the truth\" Alyssa said scowling. She crossed her arms as she grimaced. \"Why would I trust someone who has been flirting with my boyfriend?\" Kailani asked annoyed. I frowned. \"She wasn't flirting with me Kailani\" I said. Kailani glared at me. \"No one asked for your opinion\" She snapped at me. Alyssa frowned. \"Don't talk to him like that!\"Alyssa yelled at Kailani and put her hands into fists, she was going to punch Kailani on the face but I stopped her. Kailani started to walk around us, she twitched her plum lips. \"Sean? Alyssa?\" A familiar woman voice said. I turned around and saw Hannah. She came running and hugged Alyssa. I bit my lip. What happened? What is happening between Alyssa and me?. \"Why are you girls here?\" Alyssa asked. Hannah shrugged. \"We were here... But something happened. There was an earthquake and there was this pat that led us here\" Hannah said. Alyssa rubbed her wrist and looked down while Kailani was looking at her. I guess she was analizing her, she was looking at every movement Alyssa made. \"Oh... I see. Well night is coming and we should light a fire\" Alyssa said. Hannah nodded and looked at Kailani, who was still staring at Alyssa. \"What about if we go and look for some woods while Kesha or whatever her name is and Sean stay here\" Alyssa told Hannah, she nodded. I looked at Kailani who scowled when Alyssa said 'Kesha'. Alyssa smirked; Hannah and her started to walk away until they were gone. \"How many times did you guy kiss?\" Kailani asked glaring at me. Three. \"It was just... Once... But...\" I started to mumbled. \"I'm tired of it, Sean. You just don't seem to understand me\" She said. Well, she is never, I repeat, NEVER, happy with anything I do. \"Now, I am the one who doesn't understand?\" I looked at her raising a brow. \"Am I always the one who is wrong?\" I asked her. She growled. \"You never listen to me\" She said. I rolled my eyes. Because you never talk, you just babble. \" I do. I do listen, but it seems you are never pleased with me\" I said. She rolled her eyes. \"Why did she kiss you?\" She asked me. That meant I won the argument, when she doens't know what to answer, she normally changes the subject. \"I don't know.\" I snapped at her. She scoffed. ALYSSA'S POV I walked with Hannah looking for some woods. It was just an excuse to get far from Sean and talk with Hannah. \"Is everything alright Aleesee?\" She asked me. I shook my head. \"What is it? \"Sean kissed me, twice. I kissed him once.\" I told her. She nodded and sighed. \"Do you still feel something for him?\" She asked me. I hesitate. \"Ye-yes.\" the words scaped from my mouth. \"Well... I don't know\" \"You do. I can notice it just by the way you look at him\" She said, I sighed. \"But how do you know I don't look at him with hate?\" I asked her, most of the time I glare at him. I just can't accept the fact that he moved on. \"Because you look at him the same way you did in the Center of the Earth\" I bit my lip. Am I that obvious? \"And he looks at you the same way\" Hannah said with a smile. I sighed and grimaced. \"I dont think that... He is with that Kialina or whatever girl.\" I said. \"Lee, you know you love him\" Hannah said. I felt my eyes starting to full with tears. \"I know that... But I want him to be happy, and he seems happy with her.\" I said. \"He doesn't look happy and you know that... Now come on lets go back we need to light a fire\" She said and picked up some woods, I helped here and we came back. Kailani and Sean were arguing. When we arrived Sean looked down, and Kailani glared at me. Hannah and I managed to light the fire. \"I'm starving\" Jack Sparrow said. I looked at him, I didn't even remember he was here. \"So am I\" Sean said in agreement. Kailani rolled her eyes. \"What about just asking for it to the island?\" I suggested. Hannah smiled and nodded. Sean raised a brow, Jack shrugged and Kailani smirked. \"We can ask the island anything?\" Kailani asked me with a smirk. I raised a brow and nodded. \"And how do you ask for them?\" \"Uhm... Like it's not like that easy\" I said. \"Someone needs to sleep... And try to dream with food\" I continued. Kailani rolled her eyes and chuckled. What about playing a game? I looked at her analyzing her movements, she was looking at her nails. One. Looking at nails: Insecure of herself, and always hiding her thoughts. \"I'll try to..I always dream with food and... Yeah I always dream with food\" Sean said, I nodded. He sighed and laid down on the floor. He closed his hazel eyes. I kept looking at Kailani, she was twitching her plump lips. Two. Twitching lips: Hiding something. She is lying about something. I need to discover what exactly she is hiding. Kailani glared at me and rubed her wrist. She crossed her arms and her legs, I looked how the fire reflected on her big and dark brown looked at Sean and started to rub his hair, while doing it she twitched her lips and blinked multiple times. Three. Twitching lips and blinking multiple times while looking at someone: Liar. Four. Kailani, sorry to tell you this but, you are a fake girl and I'm going to let you down. GAME OVER. \"Is Sean asleep?\" I asked whispering, Kailani looked at me with her big eyes; the dark circles around her eyes tells me that she hasn't sleep for the last... How long have we been in this Island? \"I don't know, I haven't seen him asleep, when I'm at his place, we usually don't sleep\" Kailani said with an evil smirk on her face. I raised a brow and chuckled... Sean having sex with her? Believable. Hannah glared at Kailani, and Kailani smirked again. \"As you are a good girl. Why don't you check it Alexa?\" Kailani asked me with a smirk. I smirked back and crawled over to Sean. Me a good girl? Being a bad girl means to be a bitch? If yes... Then Kailani is the worst girl in the world. \"Of course, Kesha\" I answered her. There is just one way to know if Sean is asleep or not, if I do it... Maybe she will punch me in the face. \"Well... There is just one way.\" I told Kailani. I looked at Hannah and she raised a brow. \"Look, as you are his girlfriend... You should do it\" I said and looked at Kailani, who raised a brow. \"What.?\" She asked rudely. \"Kiss him, and if he doesn't kiss you back, he is sleeping\" I told her. SHe smirked and leaned down to kiss him, I stopped her before she could put her plum lips with Sean's. \"A kiss. Not a making out session.\" I told her. She raised a brow and nodded. She smashed her plump lips on Sean's. Sean didn't kiss back, that means he is asleep, or that he didn't want to kiss her. I crawled back to my place. I sighed and looked down. \"She kissed your boy\" A manly voice whispered in my ear. I raised a brow and looked at my left, I saw Jack Sparrow. I chuckled lightly and shook my head. \"Actually, I kissed her boy\" I whispered at him. He smirk and shook his head. \"Nope. He is yours, I mean, he looks at you with those eyes\" Jack whispered at me, and blinked flirtatiously. I laughed, and Kailani and Hannah looked at me. I looked down and giggled. Jack laughed too. \"What are you laughing at?\" Kailani asked me. I rolled my eyes. \"Well... Jack is really funny. Why do you have a problem with me laughing?\" I asked her, she smirked. \"Yes. I don't want you to laugh. Sean is sleeping in here... I don't want you to waking him up\" Kailani snapped at me. I rolled my eyes and then smirk. Idea. \"He won't wake up. He is already starting to dream\" I told her. SHe raised a brow. \"How can..?\" She started. \"Don't you feel it? Look... \" I cut her off. \"Nothing fantastical is happening... So I think we are in the... The island constantly moves... So we could be anywhere\" Hannah said. I raised a brow. \"What do you mean?\" I asked her. She raised a brow. \"It explains it... At the end of the book\" She told me. I raised a brow and tilted my head. Now, I remember. I never finished the book. FLASHBACK I arrived at the airport with tears on my face. It was over, over. I just broke up with Sean... Why did I do that? I sighed. I bought myself a ticket back to New York, I looked at my clock, I still had two hours left. I sighed and walked around the airport. I saw a little coffee place so I got in. I ordered a hot chocolate. I sighed and looked down. I sat on and siped of my hot chocolate. I opened my purse and took my book out. I started to read it. Why did I break up with Sean? He was a jerk, yes. But... I love him. He is a jerk... But he is MY jerk. wait... He USED TO BE my jerk. No more... Oh no... What did I do? I was getting lost in my thoughts when I felt someone staring at me. I looked up, there was a guy looking at me, I raised a brow. \"May I help you?\" I asked the guy, he was a goodlooking guy, but not my type. A type? Did I even have a type? Yes. Sean. \"What are you reading?\" He asked me. I lifted the book so he can read the cover. He nodded and smiled. \"Nice. Jules Verne?\" He asked me. Was he trying to flirt with me? \"Yep.\" I simply answered. I wasn't going to flirt because of two reasons: One, Sean. Two, Sean. \"And what's your name?\" He asked me. I smiled slightly. \"Alyssa. You?\" I asked him. \"Ethan... And were are you going to travel?\"He asked me. I smiled. \"New York. What about you?\" I told him, I didn't need to be rude with him, it wasn't his fault that I just broke up with my boyfriend. \"New York too!\" He answered, I smiled at him and he smiled back. My phone started to ring, I looked at it, Sean. I felt my eyes starting to full with tears again. \"Is everything alright?\" Ethan asked me. I nodded, I wasn't going to tell him, I just met him. I left the book on the coffee table. \"Yeah... I'm.. Yeah\" I said and looked at my clock. \"It is time to... go yeah\" I said standing up. I left the coffee place and walked around. I went to the boarding zone. I gasped... I have left the book in the coffee place. a/n: So that was it... I have two questions for you guys: -If I wrote another story... WOuld you guys read it? -Do you want anyone else point of view? (Like Trevor, or Charlie, or Kailani or whoever?) Well I hope you liked it and... Please PLEASE PLEEEAAASEEEEEE review! :3 -Minnie[Chapter 11] a/n: Guys! Hey I'm sorry I havent been updating! I kinda um... Dissapeared Jack, he was giving me troubles... And was a bit tricky for me tu put him in this chapter... But don't worry he will eventually appear. It is a bit short... But anyway hope you like it... And sorry if it is a bit tricky... Review! Ask anything! Please! :3 ALYSSA'S POV Our surrounding started to change infront of us. Suddenly we are at a cafe, I looked around and felt as if I've been on here before. I don't understand how, but I recognise this place. If I can get this, Sean is dreaming with this. I saw Sean sitting and reading the menu. I looked at Kailani and Hannah. I nodded to them and started to walk over to Sean. He is still concentrated with the menu so didn't pay attention to us while we sat with him. He got the menu down and looked at us. His hazel eyes stared into mine. \"Sean\" Kailani said. He looked at her and raised a brow. \"Yup?\" He said and then looked back to me. \"Are you... awake?\" She asked, I rolled my eyes. Don't be stupid, he is AWAKE in the dream, but actually he is still sleeping. Geez, this girl is stupid. \"Yes... I am...\" He said. \"Um... Kailani May I ask... Why are Alyssa and Hannah in our date?\" Sean asked. Those words, made me realize I'm not with Sean anymore, he is dating Kailani, he got over me. I sighed and looked at Hannah. \"I was going to ask you the same... hun\" Kailani said kissing his cheek. BITCH. \"I'm sorry\" I said. I rolled my eyes, stood up and walked to another table, Hannah following me. We sat and looked at the menus. \"So... Sean is dreaming on a date in this restaurant... And we are here... He is dreaming, so technically he doesn't know what he is doing and-\" Hannah started. \"Don't even try, Hannah. I know he got over me. And I know he loves Kailani. He does know what he is doing. So don't even try, I have to move on...Anyways... This is his dream... But we are on the island...\" I said. This island is really complicated to understand; if someone sleeps, the dream immediatly happen, and the people around the person who is sleeping will get involved in the dream somehow; the dream stops until someone... Uhm dies... Well no one exactly dies, because as the people around the someone get involved in the dream... They are not theirselves, they start just to be a part of the dream... Somehow like Inception. \"Yes, so we need to eat... And then kill someone.\" Hannah said. I nodded and looked around, yes I wanted to kill Kailani, she was kissing my boy at that moment, well... Eating... Ew I didn't know kissing that way was possible... I mean anyway back to the story, Yes I wanted to take revenge, but I'm not that type of girl, I'm different, I'm not one of those ex-girlfriends who just stalk their ex-boyfriends and try to make their lives miserable, no I'm not that way. I'm the ex-girlfriend who-is-still-madly-in-love-with-their-ex type, yeah maybe that sounds creepier... But anyway...Back to real life. While Sean and Kailani were eating, uhm I mean kissing each other... Hannah and I oreder something form the dreamy menu, which are Sean's favorite food; mac and cheese, cheese hamburgers, spaggeti, hot dogs, pizza... Yeah junk food and NO salads, what's wrong with this kid? Who doesn't like salad? Right... Boys aren't healthy. We ordered to the waiter and wait for our food. This dream is something real, or at least nothing fantastical hasn't happened. The waiter gave Hannah and I our food- I ordered pizza, since there were no salads (Hannah almost had an attack when she found out) and she ordered mac and cheese. I started to eat my food when the earth started to shake. I looked around as a big dragon... What? DRAGON? A dragon started to destroy the little restaurant we were in. The dragon was a red, 25 feet, full of scales, green eyes and big teeth monster. We all started to run, but the fire that was getting out of the mouth of the dragon was burning eveyrhting and could reach unimaginable distances. The fire got me and I felt the hot was covering me, it started to burn and I was crying and yelling things, I tried to scape but before I could run away, the dragon sent a flare to one car and it exploded, it exploded right in front of me, I was dead. SEAN'S POV I woke up, crying, and sweating. I heard gasps and sat up, I looked around and we were back in the island. I sighed in relief and saw Hannah hugging Alyssa. I don't know how the hell the island works, but I swear that was the worst 'dream' I ever had. I looked at Kailani who had a little smirk on her face, she rolled hery dark brown eyes and looked at me. \"So... We ate... And I died... Cool huh?\" Alyssa said with a tad of sarcasm in her tone of voice. I chuckled lightly and shrugged. \"I'm... Sorry for that... I didn't know how to control...\" I said, really nervous. \"Hey, it's okay! It was fun to die... A bit scary and painful, but really exciting!\" She said cracking an smile. \"Guys, we'd better have some sleep... And tomorrow we'll go straight to the waterfall... \" Hannah said, we all nodded and then I looked at Hannah. \"But... Hannah wouldn't our dreams... Come true?\" Alyssa asked her, she shook her head. \"When everyone is asleep... Nothing can happen... Well... Yes... The dreams... Cross over... But it is a better idea\" Hannah said while laying doen on the floor, Kailani copied her. I sighed and looked down. \"Alright... Let's sleep then...\" I said and rested my body on the tree, I looked at Alyssa who was just in the same position as I was but on another tree, she started to close her gray eyes and sighed. I slept for like 10 minutes, for my surprise there wasn't any fantastical landscape, or anything, guess they haven't started their dream... I sat up and looked at the girls, someone was missing, I'm pretty sure there were three girls, I looked at them and counted again, one... two. So if Kailani and Hannah were here... That means... Alyssa. a/n: DUN DUN DUN... So yeah I know it is crap... BUt feel free to complain! Please! Review! Happy New Year by the way... -Minnie:3[Chapter 12] a/n: Here's the 12th chapter... Oh my... I hope you like it... I wasn't in a good mood when I wrote it so maybe it is crap. REVIEW! REVIEW! PLEASE! IF YOU DON'T REVIEW I WON'T POST ANOTHER! REVIEW! PLEASE! I stood up catiously trying not to wake up Kailani. I started to look for Alyssa deep in the forest. The fear was eating me. I ran looking at every spot possible, no sign of her. The night was getting colder and I was starting to shiver. What was surrounding me, was incredible: A forest with big trees, dark shadows moving here and there; the floor was covered of leaves, which were making a lot of sound while I was walking. It started to get colder and colder, I rubbed my arms with my hands trying to heat me up. \"AHHHH!\" I heard a girl screaming, I followed the scream running towards it. It started to get higher and higher. I ran faster, but suddenly the scream stopped, I looked around waiting to hear the scream again... \"AHH!\" There it was, I followed it and arrived at the place where the scream was coming from. I smiled as I saw her, she turned to look at me and put her index finger infront of her mouth and mouthed 'SHH'. I raised a brow and looked infront of us. The biggest spider I've ever saw in my entire life, 20 meters far from us. Now, I knew why was the scream. Alyssa was scared of spiders since we were like 5. Alyssa started to shiver and stepped back, I grabbed her shivering and cold hand with mine, while the spider walked closer to us. The spider was as tall as a 1 story house, fat as a van, as black as petrolium, and furry. The eight long legs, were moving, all the eight eyes were looking at Alyssa and me. Alyssa started to cry. The spider was walking closer and closer in every second. I needed to think of somehting and quick... DING. \"Hey... I got an idea\" I whispered. \"What is it?!\"She whispered yelling. \"Lets climb the tree and from there I will jump and land on the spider...\" I told her. She bit her lip hesitating and then nodded. She started to climb the tree, with me helping her. She sat on a branch. \"Sean quick! She's coming closer!\" She said. I nodded and climbed the tree. I stumbled a few times, but managed to get up with Alyssa. \"Sean. You won't jump on that spider\" Alyssa said. I raised a brow and looked at her, her gray eyes were shinning with the moonlight. \"And why not?\" I asked her. She shook her head and hugged me. \"I don't want to lose you again\" She said, and a single tear came across her face. I smiled and hugged her back. \"You are not getting rid of me that simple\" I said, using her words from when we were 13 and she alsmots died in the Magnetic rocks. She smiled and looked down, her smiled quickly faded when she saw the big animal down the tree. I sighed and counted in my head 'One... Two... You can do this Sean, do it for Alyssa... C'mon... THREE!' I jumped on the spider, I felt how it got squeezed. \"Ew!\" Alyssa said, as she saw me covered with Spider green liquid. I chuckled, and looked at the death spider. I strted to get off the spider when I tripped; one of the fangs pierced my arm. I gasped in pain and Alyssa quickly jumped off the tree. \"Sean... You okay?! I need to heal that...\" She said. \"Is it better now?\" Alyssa asked me after five minutes of trying to heal my wound. It hurt and in that moment couldn't feel my arm, but it was worth it. \"Yeah... Thanks\" I said and looked down. We both stayed there looking at the big white moon. Those were the greatest five minutes until... \"You know, I hate you\" Alyssa said. I raised a brow and looked at her... Not knowing what to answer. \"Huh?\" Was the only word that came out from my mouth, genius Wasn't I? \"You... Just came and ruined my life\" She said and stood up, I stood up and looked at her in shock. Did she really hate me? She sighed and looked at me, I frowned and crossed my arms. \"You know... I was trying to get over you... And then you magically appear with those... Stupid hazel eyes, and make a fool out of me... And... Ugh I hate you!\" She said and covered her face with her hands. I stayed there looking at her, still not knowing what to say. She started to walk in cirlces. \"Why was I so stupid? Falling in love with someone that I don't deserve... And now... How stupid am I? I'm telling you? Like what the heck is wrong with me? And there is you... Standing up there like an idiot... A really handsome... ANYWAY! YOU! YES YOU SEAN ANDERSON! YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS! JUST YOU! AND YOUR DAMN HAZEL EYES!\" She yelled at me. \"Now... I'm the guilty one?! Says the girl with HYPNOTIZING GRAY EYES! \" I snapped at her; which is stupid. \"What? You are the guilty one! You were always the nice in the relationship! While I was a crap!\" She yelled at me. Wait... Were we fighting on who... Was better in the relationship? God, we have problems. \"You weren't crap! You were perfect! You ARE perfect!\" I frowned and looked at her with a 'Seriously, look at your face' look. \"OH NO NO NO!I'M NOT PERFECT! YOU ARE PERFECT! Geez, that sounded cheesy! I don't like being cheesy... Ugh anyway... back to my... I HATE YOU!\" She said and bursted out laughing. \"Oh my... Did we... We... Sounded really cheesy!\" She said between laughs, I laughed with her. \"You started!\" She laughed even more. \"Oh my, whatever! I still hate you\" She poked my chest. \"Well... I hate you more!\" I chuckled. She rolled her eyes and started to walk away. I sighed as my thoughts tried to kill me. \"Ally... Um...\" I started, she turned around and raised a brow. \"Hmm?\" \"I'm sorry... But I'm with Kailani\" I told her, IDIOT. IDIOT. IDIOT. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? IDIOT IDIOT . \"Yes... I know... So... What?\" She asked raising a brow. \"Um...Well... We can't be together\" \"Huh? Why... Wasn't that clear for you?\" She asked, with a 'DUH' face. Wait... What? She rolled her eyes. \"Look, I need to get over you, as you got over me. Yes, I know you don't even feel sorry for me, because I was just one of the million girls that you are going to date. So anyway, I'm happy for you, isgood that you found someone... So yup. Now lets go back kiddo... They are probably... Looking for us.. Yeah..\" She said and ran away. Did she really think that? Did she really believe that I got over her? \"Ally wait! Come back! Come back! Alyssa!\" I said, she was gone, AGAIN. Shit, that girl could run fast. I started to look for her, no sigh of her. Damn it. Where was she? I kept walking and walking. I felt as if someone was following me. I turned around and something hit my face, everything went dark. A/N: Alright, yes I will post the next chapter even if you don't review.. But still! Please! REVIEW! -minnie[Chapter 13] Author's Note: Hey! Sorry it took so long to update... But oh wlel here it is! Hope you like it, I wrote a bit in third person POV. just to see how the story goes like that. REVIEW! is all I ask for! Please! Follow and Favorite! REVIEW! I woke up feeling someone throwing cold water at my face. \"Finally, you woke up. I'm sorry for.. hiting you\" Hank said, I sat up and streched. I rubbed my eyes and looked at the big man infront of me. \"Why did you hit me?\" I asked rubbing my head. \"He thought you were an alien, or some stupid stuff.\" A familiar voice said, I looked at my right and saw my grand-father standing up. His eyes were surrounded by dark circles, and he seemed to keep himself awake. I chuckled lightly and looked at Hank. \"I'm sorry... Now Trevor and Charlie should be getting here soon...\" Hank said and looked at me, I frowned, Charlie . I clenched my jaw. \"Wait, Sean... Where's Alyssa?\" Hank asked me, darn, I didn't know where she was. Third Person POV Not too far away from where Sean was, the teenage girl was walking all alone. Her ginger hair was getting all messed, and the tears running through her face were cold and salty. She walked through the forest, the cold was getting her, and she needed to rest. She turned around, expecting to see the teenage boy with glorious hazel eyes she was in love with, but instead she found a cave, that she hasn't seen before. Alyssa looked at it suspisciously, the cave seemed to have something inside. A Voice started to come from the cave, whispering. Alyssa slowly walked to the cave, as the voice came higher. \"Is-is someone there?\" the ginger girl asked rubbing her hands, the voice suddenly stopped. \"And well, we shall have a magnificent garden party , and you're not invited!\" The voice said, and in that moment Alyssa's scared face faded, and a big smile replaced it. The girl started to walk inside the cave, and saw Captain Jack Sparrow, she hadn't seen him in a while. The Captain was talking to himself, he had gone insane. \"Sparrow\" The girl said, Jack continued ignoring her \"Sparrow\" She repeated. \"The tea party, oh yes, we will also have rum-\" Jack kept arguing with himself. \"Sparrow!\" \"Oh look! Is it Captain Evans? Come sweethear. We are planning a tea garden party and-\" \"Oh, my you've gone insane\" The Captain sighed and plopped himself on the ground. \"Is everything okay, Captain?\" Sparrow ignored her and crawled over the cave looking for something while The teenage girl stood there confused. \"Here it is, ahh sweet thing for gods\" Jack said and picked a bottle from the ground, he sipped from it and smirked; he patted beside him gesturing Alyssa to sit. Alyssa sat beside him and sighed, her nose was red as her eyes. \"You've been crying\" Jack said in a matter of reason, Alyssa looked at him skeptically and shook her head no. Jack rolled his eyes and gave her the bottle. Alyssa raised a brow confused and asked \"What's this?\" \"Rum.\" Jack answered and Alyssa looked at the bottle and then at Jack \"It will help you; it helped me\" Alyssa sighed and took a sip of the sweet and alcoholic beverage, she hadn't drank any alcoholic beverage for a while and she needed it. That wasn't the first time that Alyssa drank; when Sean and her broke up, she started to go to parties; she discovered alcohol and it's effects, she realized that everytime she drank, all her pain was gone, Sean was gone. She started to go to many more parties, and to drink, she didn't smoke or did drugs, but she drank; she drank until Sean was out of her mind and she could be happy again. She would wake up in another house, not knowing what happened or what she had done; she would just leave and start to think about him again. And then that night she would drink again, and so and so... It was a circle. She was becoming an addict; many people drink when they have their heart broken, but they did it for a couple of days, not months. Alyssa was getting really into the alcohol and it started to be a problem. Alyssa would always lie to Hannah telling her that she was going to a Slumber Party with some friends or that she was going to do a project, which was stupid, since she broke up with Sean she started to fail classes, she stopped talking and she turned darker. She broke her promise, the promise she made to her mom, actually she broke the two promises she made to her mother; and perhaps she wasn't of age, she was drinking illegally. Alyssa drank all the content of the bottle, and then realized she needed more, she was still thinking about Sean, Jack looked at her with amazement. \"Do you have more?\" Alyssa asked and the tears started again, she missed Sean, she really did, but she broke her promise, the worst thing a girl can do is dumb herself for a guy. Jack looked at her and nodded handing her another Rum bottle, Alyssa drank all the content again, Jack was now surprised, it still didn't work, she was still thinking about him, but the alochol was making it's effects. Alyssa started to laugh and patted Jack's back. Jack grinned and shook his head; Alyssa stood up and looked around. \"Sean Anderson is the most sexy guy in this freaking world. And I'm in love, with him!\" The teenage girl said between laughs, Jack looked surprised as Alyssa suddenly plopped on the floor and fell asleep. Not too far from that scenario, the girl with dark black hair, big brown eyes and plum lips was awake; Kailani saw that Sean and Alyssa weren't there, her mind started to creat the worst things that could happen: Alyssa and Sean kissing, hugging or even worse: having sex. Kailani put her hands into fist and hit the ground, Hannah woke up, and looked at Kailani. \"What?\" Hannah looked at Kailani skeptically, and then looked around, she realized the other teenagers were missing. \"Where are Alyssa and Sean?\" Hannah asked, Kailani glared at her with her big brown eyes. \"Good job, blondie\" Said Kailani with a harsh tone, Hannah felt hurt and glared at her, she fought the urge to hit her. \"Let's go and look for them\" Hannah said standing up. They both started to walk around the forest, and the sun began to rise. Back to the boys... Charlie and Trevor came up with some woods, Trevor looked at Sean and got surprised. \"Sean, Where's Al?\" Trevor asked, Charlie glared at Sean, since Charlie did like Alyssa and was really worried for her. \"I-I don't know...\" Sean answered with a scared tone. Trevor glared at him, but before he could say anything Alexander said \"It wasn't his fault, he was with Alyssa, but this idiot came and hit him\" Alexander pointed at Hank, who smiled nervously, Trevor rolled his eyes. \"Don't worry, bet she is with Hannah and Kailani\" Sean tried to assure his uncle.[Chapter 14] a/n: Hey everyone! So sorry it took so long to update! But here it is! I hope you like it! Please, follow favorite, and review! And please tell me if you like me to keep telling the story by the third person point of view, or if you want me to go back to any character's point of view. Please! Review! Enjoy the story... Yup! -Minnie- -Chapter 14: 'Feeling the urge to...'- \"Great, now we need to look not only for the dumbass girl, also for my idiotic boyfriend\" Said Kailani, Hannah resisted the urge to kill her. \"Don't dare calling them that way again\" Hannah said with a harsh tone, she was getting tired of the girl with dark brown eyes. The tanned girl creeped herself walking; the sun was up and the environment had completely change; they were now walking through palms, and unknown tropical trees, not too far from them, there was a waterfall; the waterfall, the reason of why the had come here, it was near them, and Hannah and Kailani didn't even notice it. Far away from them; the boys were approaching to the cave, but while doing that, they didn't stop arguing. Sean kept arguing with Hank, Trevor with Alexander and Charlie just walked with them awkwardly. They were walking into the nightmare part, so it meant that they were going to have trouble, but everything happens for a reason. Sean kept yelling at Hank, and Trevor finally stopped. Sean and Hank were arguing of why he had brought him here, because he said the girl didn't even care about Sean, in other hand, Trevor and Alexander were arguing of why Alexander had left Trevor. And Charlie, well, he was just there. \"I LOVE HER! I DON'T CARE...\" Sean yelled at the big man. \"She doesn't even care about you!\" Hank yelled back. \"She does!\" And while Trevor and Alexander... \"You left me! You just cared about Max! You didn't care about me! You didn't even go to my wedding!\" Trevor said with anger. \"I would have if only you had told me!\" \"I DID! I SENT YOU THE INVITATION!\" Trevor answered madly. \"WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP ARGUING?!\" Charlie yelled at them, they all looked at him confused. \"I mean... if it's not much asking...\" Before anyone could answer anything, thunderbolts and lightnings started to creep them out, the storm was slowly getting worse. The only shelter the five men could find was a small cave in the middle of nowhere. \"Darn. I hate storms\" Sean said and ran his hand through his wet hair, two minutes later after they were all safe and sound sitting inside of the cave. \"Ugh yes, so do I\" A familiar masculine and british voice said, they turned around, and found Jack, slowly drinking of a green botttle, a meter far away from me, a young girl laid beside and with a bottle in her hand, her clothes covered with mud and her face pale as the winter snow. \"Is that... Alyssa?\" Charlie asked, not believing what his eyes were seeing; the crush he had on her was slowly disssapearing. Jack cackled and nodded, Sean looked at her with a confused face. \"She drank? Oh, not again please\" Trevor said. \"She drank the whole bottle, I was very impressed\" Captain Sparrow adventured, walking around the cave slowly creeping himself over Sean. \"And it was all yer fault\" He pointed at the boy, who's face became while he glared at the man in front of him. \"My fault?\" Sean chocked in his own saliva. The oldest man glared at the pirate who was smirking, Alexander stood up and walked over the redhair girl. \"Yes, yer fault. Yer name is Sean, isn't it? Then yes, it is yer fault. She yelled yer name, while sleeping\" The Captain said while putting his hat on. Trevor kicked a rock violently, causing to hurt his foot. \"I can't believe it! She just... I thought, darn!\" Trevor said, and cursed between teeth. \"We can wake her up, you know\" Alexander said, slowlyt shaking Alyssa; the girl frowned and hugged the bottle. \"We wouldn't be in this kind of problems if it wasn't for you!\" Trevor pointed at Sean, who was tired of getting blamed for everything. \"FOR ME? Trevor, I'm sorry. But this is just not my fucking fault. This shit, is not my fucking fault, it wasn't my fault that Alyssa is the most stubborn girl in this world, who happens to get mad for everything, it wasn't my fault that she is perfect, it wasn't my fault that her smile is beautiful. It wasn't me who took her to the Center of the Earth. It wasn't me who gave her the book, it wasn't me who didn't take care of her at all! No! That certainly wasn't me! I was the one who fell in love with her since we were six! It was me who kissed her in Valentine's day! It was me who saved her life! I was the one who loved her as if there wasn't going to be tomorrow! I was the one who was always there for her! I was the one who listened to her problems! It is me who still loves her and always will\" Sean finished, with tears slowly coming from his eyes. It was pretty obvious that he wouldn't keep his feelings for more longer, and with Trevor always telling him off... Well let me put it like this: Sean is... a spark, if you keep 'feeding' that spark... What will happen? Exactly, fire; and that's what Sean is, he was a spark, and well, the fire was finally lit. \"You still... Love her?\" Trevor asked Sean. \"I do.\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"Did I really have to?\" Sean asked not believing it, he didn't realize that the girl was slowly waking up. \"I didn't realize...\" Trevor started- \"How much I love her? Want to know? Count all the stars, then multiply it by fifteen hundred, sum a billion more, and now you have it, that is how much I love Alyssa.\" \"You-\" Trevor started. \"I love you too, Sean\" A voice said, everyone turned around and looked at the redhair girl, who was slowly standing up, her gray eyes didn't look at anyone but at Sean. \"The lovebirds finally agreed\" Jack muttered slowly. Charlie, scowled and punched the cave, he felt the anger raising and getting through all his body, he hadn't experienced so much anger before, he didn't know why but he felt the strange feeling of wanting to punch Sean hard in the face, and he did. Sean stood there, at the beginning he didn't believe it, but then they fought, Alyssa tried to stop them, but then she felt the urge to look for Kailani and punch her in the face, so she left the cave running. Everyone felt the urge of doing something, they never wanted to do before. Trevor, to punch Sean in the face (and he did) \"Jeez, is everyone against me?\" Sean thought; Jack felt the urge to love a woman, which was, something new in him; Alexander, well he felt the urge to stab himself, but don't worry he didn't, (he didn't find any knives); Hank, well he felt the urge to... Uhm, what was he doing? In the name of god, that was... Was he really dancing and singing 'Dancing Queen'? God that was... My eyes, I mean.. Back to the story. But theirs, weren't the weirdest, or worst... What Sean was thinking, is what scares me and worries me... Sean felt the urge of... a/n: DUN DUN DUN! What do you think Sean is thinking of? Mwuahaha!

Also if you have any ideas I will be happy to put them in the story! Kisses and hugs!:* -Minnie Alyssa's POV I ran away looking for Kailani, with my fist ready to smash her bitchy face. I suddenly bumped into her, I was going to punch her little plump lips but I resisted. Hannah walked over to me and pulled me into a hug; I hugged her back and looked at Kailani. \"I wanted to do this since I met you\" I said before throwing my fist into her face; she winced in pain and then punched me, well I should have guessed that would happen. Hannah stopped me before I could do anything. \"Alyssa! What are you doing?\" She asked me, I shrugged and rubbed my eye, the place where Kailani had hit me. \"I don't know! I just felt the urge to!\" I said, as Kailani glared at me, I'll be honest I wanted to laugh at the tanned girl. \"You..? Oh now I... Get it! We are in the dark side! Verne described it that your darkest secrets are... Showed... Then...\" Hannah was interrupted by someone tackling me; I looked up to see Sean. I was going to complain and push him off me, but he literally smashed his lips into mine, making the kiss really... 'Passionate'. Then I realized what he was going to do, and that everyone was watching; I pushed him off and stood up. \"What in this world was that?\" Kailani asked yelling; I couldn't help but smile at the ground mischievously; I knew what Sean was trying to do, and it kinda scared me but I liked it. \"Uh, sorry... The island is really controlling me... Seriously like... It controlled everyone, I mean Hank was dancing and singing Dancing Queen!\" Sean said, with a little chuckle; I looked up at him and his cheeks were bright red and his lip was getting bitten. Hannah wrinkled her nose before asking \"Where's Trevor?\" Before Sean or I could say anything Trevor's voice came in saying: \"I'm here!\" Hannah's eyes brightened as she embraced the brunette man and placed a kiss on his lips, I smiled at that, when you see them you can see there is still hope in love. The other ones came behind him; I smiled up at them, while Hannah and Trevor were still kissing. I looked around everyone and saw Kailani sitting beside a tree, her head hiding in her knees; I sighed and thought for a moment; I had been a bitch to her, even though I loved Sean more than anything in the world, she was still his girlfriend. I sighed and walked over to her, I sat beside her. She glares at me and said with venom \"Get away from me\" I could notice her eyes were red and puffy, not mentioning she had one black, and that her face was all covered with little cuts. \"Look, Kailani I'm sorry. I've been acting like a bitch to you, I'm sorry\" I said, it was a honest apology. She glared at me \"You don't say\" she said sarcastically; I sighed and ran my hand though my red hair; Kailani glared at me again and I said \"I'm really sorry, I was just really jealous of you, I mean look at yourself; you have a nice body, you are a pretty girl and the fact of you dating Sean didn't help at all\" \"Are you really sorry?\" She asked, I nodded; she looked at me for a Moment and sighed. \"I am\" I said. \"Do you really love him?\" She asked me, I was taken completely off guard but I nodded saying \"I really do, more than anything in this world\" \"Then he is yours\" Kailani said; I looked up at her confused. \"He loves you too, I'll break up with him.\" She continued; I was still spaced out and I didn't get what she was saying. \"Sean deserves to be happy; and he will be happy with you\" \"Bu-But don't you love him?\" I asked; she sighed and bit her lip \"I like him, but I like that Charlie guy better\" she said; I nodded and looked at Charlie, who was with the other a few meters away from us; his big blue eyes were still beautiful, but they were nothing compared to Sean's hazel greenish eyes; okay that is at least in my opinion... What? Can't someone be so deeply in love? Anyway, I looked deeper at Charlie and stared at his smile, again I'm sorry but Sean's lopsided smile can't compare to anything. Jeez, I'm sounding cheesy, but oh well I'm a young woman in love, I can't help it. \"well good luck with him\" I said; she sighed and hugged her knees closer. \"I'll leave you, Im going with Hannah\" I stood up and walked over the other ones. I was going to walk over to Hannah but someone stopped me, I looked at Sean, he has a worried face, he was clenching his perfect jaw and his eyes weren't shinning as they always dis. \"Everything okay?\" He asked, I nodded . \"Yeah, everything fine... Why do you ask?\" I look at him curiously. He looks at me with those stunning eyes of his before saying \"Well, I saw you were with Kailani... I was worried...\" I shake my head, and assure him that everything is fine before walking to Hannah and Trevor, the second one glares at me; think he saw me drinking. I sigh and say \"I'm sorry\" Honestly, I don't know why I'm apologizing, but oh well maybe they get it. Or maybe not, Trevor raises a brow; and I continue, let's see what comes out of my mouth \"For drinking\" there, lovely, maybe that would work... \"And for... Escaping, and not telling you where I was going... And for bringing you guys here... And for being a bad girl\" I said, I know, I know the last thing totally ruiit, but oh well. I stayed there waiting for them to do something; until they both pulled me into a hug. I awkwardly hugged them back at the beginning but then hugged them really tight, I realized they were like my parents, they've been there since I was 13, wow, 5 years taking care of me, well that's a job, and a difficult one; I mean I the most weird, stubborn and crazy girl in the entire world, and taking care of me... Well, I admire them. \"Does anyone else hear uh... Water falling?\" Hank said, I looked up at him, gosh I can't look at him the same way, ugh just imagine him, a big and strong man singing and dancing 'dancing queen'; just no. Anyway, I started to listen deeply, and yes, indeed I could hear water falling. We were close; my opportunity to get to the waterfall was really close.[Chapter 16] A/n: hey everyone! Here it is... Dun dun dun... What is going to happen?! I know you guys are going to kinda hate me...anyway hope you like this chapter which is kinda the end... But the new beginning! And see I did as I promised! I posted it as soon as possible! :) well READ AND REVIEW! -Minnie I ran excited; I didn't care if they were going to follow me or not, in fact I didn't want them to follow me, but unfortunately they did follow me, pity. I wanted to be alone, I didn't want them to know what I was going to wish... \"Alyssa! Wait... Be careful! Come back!STOP!\" Someone said behind me, I rolled my eyes and then... Oh darn, not again. l looked down to se a cliff, good thing I stopped before falling... I gulped, and shuddered, the waterfall was there, we just had to cross this darn... Cliff. \"Now, you see why you had to stop\" Hank said, I frowned whilst the others arrived, Sean whistled Low, and I frowned more. The question was going through my head: 'What was the height of this big cliff?' I think Hannah thought the same and looked up at Trevor and me. She got a flare out of her backpack and I smiled... Trevor chuckled and looked at me \"I'm Trevor, I'm stubborn and I won't listen to Alyssa\" he said imitating my thirteen years old self. Hannah, Sean, Trevor and I laughed uncontrollably... While the others stayed there without getting a word... \"Sean, look at your watch\" Sean did, and looked at me... \"Wait\" I said, before Trevor could do anything. \"Let's better use a luminous stick thingy, we don't know if there's magnesium in there\". I said remembering my little journey, Trevor nodded as Hannah gave him one... \"Ready Sean?\" Trevor asked, Sean nodded; like old times... \"Three. Two. One\" Trevor let the the luminous thingy, we all stayed silent \"One, two, ..\"thud \"Almost three..\" \"It's the same... Like in Iceland. Two hundred feet\" I said, they nodded. \"The only difference is we don't have any rope\" Hannah added. We sighed, come on, someone needs to have an idea. \"Well... We don't need any rope\" Charlie said, I looked at him raising a brow, was he an idiot or what? Everyone looked at him frowning, and some of us even chuckled. I think I even heard Jack saying \"What an idiot\" which was quite funny... Charlie rolled his eyes; \"Look, if we walk there...\" He pointed at some random point, and we all turned around to see that there was a part of the cliff where we could all jump to the other side, oh, he wasn't an idiot, whoops. We all nodded and walked over to the spot, I sighed and prepared my self to jump, my whole body tensed, we needed to jump ameter And a half, it wasn't that close... And well if something happened... Well, goodbye you are going to die. And well the possibilities of me surviving l... Weren't big. Ooh, I have a really positive mind, don't I? \"Alyssa... Wait\" I felt a hand over my shoulder, I looked at Sean, his hazel eyes locked with my gray ones, I felt my whole body loosen, the sight of him, feeling the warmth of his hand, relaxed me. I raised a brow, waiting for him to answer. \"Let me go first\" I frowned, yes I love him, but hell no, I was going first. He was going to jump when pulled him back and I jumped; don't worry I did jump to the other side, and then ran straight to the waterfall, finally, here, it was here! I jumped excited, now... Darn I didn't know how it worked. Oh great, all this way, and I got this far, and I dont know it works... Genius Alyssa... I slapped my face and sank to the ground, waiting for the others to come. And they did, they looked at me, I guess they expected me to do something, while I looked at them. We spent at lest five minutes that way, they looking at me, me looking at them. Awkward? Yes, pretty much. \"So... Do you guys like llamas?\" Sean said, wait a minute, what did he say? we all laughed and shrugged. \"Uhm, yeah I like llamas... So, Hannah how does the waterfall work?\" I asked, while standing up. \"What?\" Hank asked, \"we've been through all this and you don't know how this thing works?\" Hank continued madly. \"Uh...\" I answered nervously. \"Seriously?\" Kailani asked. \"I've been risking my life for someone who doesn't know what she is goin to do!?\" She snapped. \"Well let me..\" I said but someone else cut me off \"What?! Alyssa?\" Charlie said, suddenly everyone, (Except Sean and Jack, guess the second one didn't care) were yelling at me, I stepped back, and listened at all., I nodded without saying a word. \"SHUT UP!\" I yelled at them, they all silenced, wow, now I know how Dumbledore feels. \"YES, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WORKED. YES, I I KNOW THIS IS STUPID BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY FATHER IS!\" I yelled, wait a second, did I just yelled my wish? Trevor looked at me, they all stopped, not knowing anything, Trevor is the only one to know. My father was a VernIan, too. He wasn't the only one to go to the center of the earth, he went with Sean's father, then why didn't we find him? That's the same bloody question I've been asking to myself for the last 3 years. Maybe you are asking why only three? Your journey was 6 years ago, well Trevor told me about it. In fact I didn't even know I had a father, they had told me he had died or something when I was born, but surprise surprise he went to the center of the earth like Max did, they went together because he was also my fathers best friend. Oh, you thought that I came here to wish that Sean and I came back together huh? Yeah I'm a girl full of surprises. They all looked at me, I frowned, Hannah sighed. \"There are some steps you need to follow...\" \"Alyssa!\" everything turned blurry. \"Alyssa!\" Now it was darker. \"It's nonsense! She has been unconscious for more than an hour!\" Someone said \"She's waking!\" I shuddered. I opened my eyes, and closed them again, I opened them... Where am I? Trevor looked at me, I looked at him, he looked different, he looked way younger. He was wearing a gray shirt, some kaki pants. The words come out from my mouth before I can stop them \"Where's Sean?\" Trevor made a funny face, and laughed. I looked around, dark walls and rocks, I am in a cave... This cave, I know it. \"Oh look who woke up. Morning, idiot\" a familiar young voice said, I sat up to see 13 years old Sean. I smiled, stood up, ran over to him and pulled him into a hug, he didn't hug back, weird... \"Alright, now think this one really hit her head\" Sean said pushing me away, wait a second, what? I looked at him curiously, then I looked down at myself, these clothes... Wait... \"What's going on?\" I asked. \"That's the same I ask to you\" Sean said, he raised a brow. \"Ha-Ha really funny... Wait where are we? Where did the island take us?\" I asked; Sean turned to see Trevor, who just shrugged. \"Island? Do you feel okay, idiot?\" Sean asked me, Did he just call me idiot? Oh how nice he is to the one that loves him. \"Alyssa, come here I need to put some bands in your head, and you need to drink some medicine\" A familiar foreign voice said. Hannah told me to come over to her, I raised a brow And walked over to her. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"Where's Kailani, and Charlie, and Hank and Alexander?\" I asked, Hannah raised a brow. \"Where's who?\" Hannah asked. \"What is wrong with her?\" Sean Asked. \"She hugged me... Like seriously. What's wrong with her? Didn't she hate me?\" I raised a brow, oh no, trust me Sean I don't hate you \"Hannah what happened?\" I asked. \"Well... When Trevor threw away the sensor, a lighting fell and made both of you fell, and the rocks fell in you, you hit your head and you were unconscious for an hour or so\" Hannah said, wait a minute... The sensor? But that happened years ago... \"and the island?\" I asked again. \"What in this world are you talking about? You've been asking for an island like for one hundred times...\" Sean answered me in a definitely not politely way. \"The island of the lost dreams!\" I said. Trevor chuckled with Sean, who wriggled his finger in his temple as in a sign of saying I was crazy, I glared at him, and he smirked and winked one of those gorgeous hazelish greenish eyes of him, Alyssa concentrate! Wait a minute he is being the same jerk when we were thirteen... But it can't be possible... \"Seems someone had a really imaginative dream. Why don't you tell us about it Alyssa?\" Trevor. chuckled. \"But...\" I started but stopped myself... Was everything a dream? Didn't we go to the center of the earth? Didnt we go to the island? Are we only in the cave? Didn't Sean and I dated.? I looked up at Sean; who was tapping his foot and looking at the ceiling. I realized something... that had been just a dream... That means... I fell in love with Sean just because of my dream. Is that even possible? Fallin in love with someone in a dream? Wait, I just dont love Sean... I am obsessed with him! \"Uh, well it was a weird and scary dream\" I said. \"Yeah, the weirdest thing was that you constantly mumbled Sean's name was the scariest\" Trevor said, my eyes widened and my cheeks started to burn, Sean looked down with red cheeks. \"um, is not that I don't want to hear Alyssa's fabulous dream... But I think we should get going and try to find to escape out of this\" Sean said trying to diffuse the tension I guess. Yes, it had all been a dream. A/N: oh no it was just a dream! :( Oh well... What will happens to Sean and Alyssa..? ","Summary":" A/N: So... Here's the first chapter for sequel to Journey to the Center of Get me out here! I hope "},{"Movie":"It's a Wonderful Life","Title":"320 Sycamore","Author":"magooster","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12847144","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The sun streams in through the window of room and across the top of a large, fine wooden desk. In this high contrast scene of light and shadow, several items are clearly visible. A small bust of Napoleon, an antique desk lamp with a glass shade, a folded Bedford Times newspaper bearing the year 1932. All items appear to be part of a museum-like still-life, until the movement of a pair of old hands breaks the stillness. The fingers of the hands, which had been laced, separate and lift a document from the desktop. The document bears the words \"Binding Contract\" in bold letters at the top, followed by a lot of small print. The hands belong to Henry F. Potter. Henry is ensconced in his high-backed, ornately carved wheelchair. Sitting behind his office desk, he squints as he ponders the contents of the document. One might believe that Henry is alone in that shadowy room, until a shadow begins to move into the frame of the lighted window. A human silhouette now stands just across the desk from Henry and says, \"It's a game changer, Henry,\" Henry glances at the silhouette, then back at the contract. As Henry rubs his chin in contemplation, his visitor urges action, \"You were a man in deep water, with no land in sight.\" The bottom of the contract has a blank line and the name \"Henry F. Potter\" typed underneath. The unseen orator encourages Henry, \"And now, your ship has come in.\" Henry, again rubs his chin. The shadow continues to press his case, \"Provided you have enough brains to climb aboard!\" Henry's gaze shifts to the quill pen which lies next to the paper. His hand lies within reach of the pen. Henry's guest issues a taunting question, \"Moment of truth, Henry. What will your decision be?\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: A dreary rain falls on the town of Bedford Falls. A young man of 15, dressed in knee-high socks, knickers a collared shirt and suspenders runs along the sidewalk, clutching a large envelope. He passes the street-side storefronts, many empty and shuttered. He passes the long faces in the long lines at the soup kitchen. He passes a homeless citizen asking for a handout. The courier makes a sharp turn at a two-story office building. In a flash he bounds up the steps, stopping at the front door, knocking as he catches his breath. The shiny plaque near the front door confirms that this is his destination. It reads, \"Congressman August Kraft, United States House of Representatives, State of New York, 38th Congressional District\". The courier knocks again, this time with gusto. A burly man of roughly 60 years answers. He wears a well-tailored business suit with a red waistcoat. His thinning hair and bushy mustache are mostly silver. An eyepatch covers his left eye. As the door opens, a voice from behind the man is heard, \"The committee is on the line and is requesting a response!\" \"Indeed!\" replies the man in the red waistcoat. \"Well, tell them to expect an answer soon!\" The man turns his attentions to the boy in the rain. \"Yes?\" The boy responds, \"Delivery for Congressman Kraft.\" \"I'm Kraft.\" the man replies as he takes the package from the boy, \"Thank you,\" the congressman nods at the boy and swings the door to close it. However, the door bounces open, as doors will when a shoe-clad foot has been strategically placed on the threshold. The shoe belongs to the delivery boy, \"He said to see you about payment.\" \"Did he now?\" the legislator replies with a sarcastic tone as he reaches for his wallet. The courier receives payment, and based on his reaction, the amount provided by the congressman is very generous. August closes the door and opens the package. Inside is a legal document, a contract for purchase of the Bedford Falls Tool and Machine Works. August leafs through the documents, pausing at the last page. At the bottom is the signature of Henry F. Potter, dated May 15, 1932. Kraft pauses momentarily, as if weighing his options. He extracts a document that sits atop many other documents on his desk. It is a wedding invitation from Mary Hatch and George Bailey. It is dated May 15, 1932. August frowns at the invitation. Moments later, the congressman releases a decisive sigh. He takes a pen from his desk and signs the document. Next, he locates his official seal, and he affixes it to the document. \"Rudy!\" he calls out to a staffer across the room. As Rudy approaches, the congressman turns to grab a small envelope, already sealed, already addressed, resting patiently on the corner of his desk. August leans close to Rudy, whispers instructions and hands the envelope to him. Rudy nods, dons a trench coat, buries the envelope in a pocket and heads out into the rain to hail a cab. August resumes his examination of the documents from the package. He lifts the telephone receiver and dials a number. \"Henry? It's August,\" the congressman said, speaking into the receiver. The terse voice on the other end of the line belongs to the same person who signed the contract, Henry Potter. \"I take it the documents have arrived.\" August replies, \"They have.\" \"And the ceremony?\" Potter queries. \"Will begin at 1 pm, rain or shine.\" Potter responds with fury, \"Confound it man! Can you or can you not take direction? I gave specific instructions that it should begin at 2 pm!\" \"The time change was unavoidable. Of course if you would rather discontinue our agreement…\" Potter seethes, \"The agreement remains in place. What other disappointing news do you have?\" \"None!\" says August. \"All the other arrangements have been made, as requested. The location, the band…\" \"And anonymity?\" \"Is assured until I introduce you.\" Kraft responded. \"Your man can keep your car parked on the other side of the tracks during the introduction. I'll signal you from the podium with a green flag when it is time for you to approach.\" \"Green flag, yes,\" Potter muses. \"After which our little arrangement will be concluded.\" Kraft interjects, \"They're going to wonder Henry.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"The townsfolk. They will wonder why the richest, least helpful person in town would suddenly want to save the Tool and Machine Works, the building that was a crowning achievement of his rival. They will have no idea.\" \"And let's keep it that way.\" The click on the other end of the line confirms to August that the conversation has ended. August hangs up the receiver and places the contract in the wooden tray on his desk. The breeze from a nearby open widow ruffles the pages slightly. Kraft grabs his keys, his briefcase and an umbrella and heads for the front door. He stops before he makes contact with the door handle. He turns on his heels and backtracks toward his desk. August seizes a silver-edged photo frame containing a picture of what might be a father a mother and a young boy. August smiles at the picture, \"This is your day, too!\" Sliding the frame into the front pocket of his satchel, August exits the office. It remains an overcast day, although the rain has subsided.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Bedford Falls Tool and Machine Works is a brick-faced building. Two tall smoke stacks stand to the rear of the four-story, 350 foot wide edifice. It occupies a broad footprint just to the west of the Bedford Falls train station. There is plenty of space in front of the forty-foot tall structure. At one time, a steady stream of carts and trucks would roll into that lot, delivering raw materials or carrying away the parts and equipment that the workers produced. However, at this moment, the only movement is from an open window on the second floor. A man with rolled up shirt sleeves peers out of the window, clearly on the lookout for something or someone. Inside that building are several men, most of them in business suits. It is an unscheduled meeting of the City Council. They have gathered based on rumors that big news about this now-silent industrial engine would be forthcoming. One of the men checks his pocket watch, \"If we don't get word soon, I can't promise that the flyers will be ready in time.\" The man in shirtsleeves approaches the crowd in a rush, \"Someone is coming. Someone is coming!\" At that moment, Rudy enters, shaking rain from his coat, and presents the note to the president of the city council. The president, with all eyes watching, receives the envelope. After a pause, he opens the envelope and reads aloud while the others stand close and lean in with keen interest, \"The re-opening of the Bedford Falls Tool and Machine Works has been…\" The president's dramatic pause causes all within earshot to hold their breath, \"…confirmed.\" Elation envelops the citizens. Cheers, smiles and backslaps are abundant as the president finishes reading the note, \"Prepare for public announcement as discussed. Benefactor will be introduced at that time. At Your Service, August Kraft.\" The words had hardly left his mouth before many of them begin scurrying about. Outside, the rain is now just a drizzle. As seen from across the train tracks, several maintenance workers begin clearing debris from the lot in front of the Tool and Machine Works. It is the first signs that the mothballed enterprise might be making a comeback. A dog ambling near the tracks suddenly stops as a rumbling is heard. As the rumbling gets louder, the dog begins to cower and slink away. The screeching of iron wheels on iron rails becomes audible and quickly transforms into a hideous sound, reminiscent of human suffering. The noise and smoke reach a crescendo as the source of chaos rockets past the Bedford Falls station. Like a bad dream, the ruckus quickly recedes, leaving a station shrouded in smoke. A figure appears amid the dissipating smoke. He is a mousey fellow, mid-thirties, well dressed, tie, vest, no jacket, and a bowler perched atop his head. One hand, is at his side. That hand wears a leather glove with the fingers exposed. That same hand grasps a stub of an old stogie. A metal chain is attached to the belt loop of his pants. Attached to the other end of the chain is a small metallic human skull. The visitor stretches and yawns, \"Business travel always wears me out. Glad to be back on Terra Firma, though.\" He stops, pauses and squints as he looks up towards the sky, And what is my client's name, again?\" The man in the vest and bowler stares at the palm of his non-gloved hand. A bloody scar forms the word 'Potter'. \"Riiiigght, Henry!\" says the stranger. His gaze remains fixed on his palm, \"Can't go empty handed, though!\" He passes a train porter who has bent over to pick up luggage. A semi-gloved hand dislodges the cash tip protruding from the porter's back pocket. Then, the bowler-clad visitor crosses the tracks and heads toward downtown Bedford Falls. Behind him, the factory maintenance workers continue their efforts.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: A 1928 Willys-Overland Whippet pauses before the intersection of Spruce Street and Jefferson Avenue. August Kraft, who is behind the wheel, is greeted warmly by a female pedestrian, \"Hello August!\" Kraft responds, \"Hello Clara!\" \"I thought you'd abandoned us!\" Clara says, \"What brings you to town?\" \"Everyone gets homesick, occasionally.\" \"Is Emily with you?\" \"No, she's back in Albany. I'm just here for the day. How's Joe?\" \"Construction's dried up. He'll land a repair job every now and again. We're getting by ok. But so many people, August…\" Clara's voice cracks and trails off. August puts a reassuring hand on Clara's shoulder. \"I understand.\" Clara forces a smile while wiping a tear, \"The future seemed much brighter in our youth.\" August is determined not to let the conversation get too dark. He offered, \"Chin up, Clara. Good news might be just around the bend.\" Clara smiles and nods. Before he drives off, Kraft tips his hat. \"My best to you and your family.\" Across town, Mr. Weiss who is the manager of the print shop stands in front of his store with his press operator, \"That's right. Rush order, four-thousand count on heavy stock with blue ink.\" The press operator voices his concern, \"Holy smokes! For a job like this, I'm gonna need to bring in two, maybe three other guys!\" Before the operator has finished speaking, Mr. Weiss responds, \"I don't care if you need to bring in a dozen guys! These flyers get printed, stat!\" As the two rush back into the print shop, next door at the Tobacconist, the door swings open. Out on to the sidewalk steps the stranger who appeared at the train station. He has a pair of smokes in his vest pocket. He pauses and muses aloud, \"Now, how do I get Henry to buy in?\" Meanwhile, August has made his way to Jefferson and Sycamore. He drives forward as if to continue up Jefferson, but pauses and turns onto Sycamore. He strolls down the row of neat houses until he finds himself in front of a two-story house that was empty and badly in need of repair. August parks and exits the vehicle. He stands, staring at 320 Sycamore for the longest time. At last, his attention is diverted by the approach of a pedestrian. \"Hello, Hab!\" The pedestrian smiles as he walks up to August and shakes his hand, \"Well, if it isn't the renowned Thomas Campbell! Is this a physician's holiday?\" Thomas responds, \"I'm on my way to the office now. But I have to confide, if you are looking to return to the old neighborhood, I'm afraid that this house is not for sale.\" August nods. \"In this condition who would want to buy it? Such a shame! And such an important part of this town's history.\" \"Ours included. I think that the Granvilles, God rest their souls, would be a little disappointed that no one is looking out for this legacy of theirs.\" August arches his eyebrows, sighs and tries to steer the conversation toward happier topics, \"How is May these days?\" \"She is well.\" Thomas responds. \"I assume you are in town for George Bailey's wedding.\" \"That is today, isn't it? Unfortunately, no.\" August continues to query his friend, \"Is George still tending to our Building and Loan?\" With a hint of pride, Thomas responds, \"To his everlasting aggravation!\" August marvels at time that has past, \"Has it really been four years since George's father was called home?\" Thomas' response displays a sentimental tone, \"Yes, but if Peter were still alive, he would be so proud of George carrying on the family business. Particularly since so many other businesses have gone under recently. I only hope I live to see the day that Bedford Falls is revitalized.\" \"That day may be much closer than you can imagine.\" August hints. \"Do tell!\" As a response, August offers, \"I am headed into town on business. I can drive you to your office and on the way, I can offer you some intriguing news.\" Thomas tips his hat toward August, \"How can I refuse?\" Kraft begins making his way around to the passenger side of the vehicle, \"The team of Kraft and Campbell together again! Or was that Campbell and Kraft?\" Thomas replies as he enters the passenger side of the vehicle, \"Either way Doc, just like old times!\" Thomas pauses to stare at the old house in disrepair. Weeds almost entirely obscure the remnants of a picket fence. Near the porch steps lies a rotted piece of wood. Faded words are barely visible: \"The Welcome Hearth\". Thomas sighs and voices his disbelief, \"When 320 Sycamore went vacant, I feel as if we lost the beating heart of Bedford Falls.\" As the vehicle begins moving away from the weathered structure, August responds, \"Doctor, you know as well as anyone, resuscitation is just a matter of applying pressure in the right place\".[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: In his mind's eye, August Kraft could see 320 Sycamore as it stood at the turn of the century. Recently built and freshly painted, it is an enviable property. On the sun-dappled porch, a woman sits in a dress that suggests a late Victorian style. It is full-length with a high collar. She watches a young child in a playpen near her. A stately gentleman exits the house. His long frame is accentuated by a fine suit of striped pants, a vest, a tie, tailcoat and a top hat. He kisses his wife and makes his way down the path before opening the gate of the picket fence and walking up the street. The nearby park is alive with activity. The banner hanging across the dirt road reads \"Bedford Falls Summer Festival 1903\". Adults and children mill about, sampling vendor's wares. There is a lake upon which a number of small canoes and rowboats drift. At one end of the lake is a bandstand. A military band, in full dress blares Souza tunes. Amid the bustle, two men, both in their late twenties are conversing. They wear sensible suits, vests and straw hats. One of the two men is a younger August Kraft, easily distinguishable by his eyepatch and his slightly wider girth, \"...Two men and a dog! They passed through Buffalo last week on their way to New York. Astonishing accomplishment!\" Thomas adds, \"It's been rumored that the man controlling the carriage was heard to say, 'Roads? Where we have been, we don't need roads!'\" August chuckles, \"Two men, coast to coast in a motor carriage. In less than three months! I dare say you and I would not survive that trip.\" Thomas adds, \"August, I dare say that you and I would never be motivated enough to try!\" The conversation generates a wistful thought from Thomas, \"It is an amazing time that we live in. An age of great ideas and bold actions. It seems a shame that you and, a doctor and a lawyer, bright young professionals, cannot create something useful, something…lasting.\" \"For instance?\" \"Maybe a baby bottle that is always ready for a baby when it gets hungry.\" August chuckled, \"So that's what keeps you up at night? Can't say I'm surprised.\" Thomas is catching the aroma of the many food tables scattered across the park. He says, \"Speaking of hungry,\" And he veers to his left, bumping shoulders with his friend, altering their path to arrive specifically at table offering \"Major William's Red Hots\". Thomas holds up two fingers to the vendor, \"Two with Kraut.\" The vendor delivers the two hot dogs, as requested. Thomas hands one to August and says as he walks away. \"Pay the man!\" August, having compensated the vendor, soon catches up with the young doctor. Thomas decides to continue the previous discussion, \"And you?\" challenged the young physician. Yet August was lost in thought, \"Hm?\" Thomas was forced to elaborate, \"Is there any major achievement you'd like to accomplish in this lifetime?\" Thomas waited for his friend's response but none came. The young Kraft was fixated on a daydream, in a world of his own, until his friend's voice broke the trance, \"Hab?\" Kraft, still staring ahead, at last, responded, \"Actually, there is. I've a particular notion that spurs my imagination, and I'd like to share it with you.\" Thomas, mocking his friend's serious tone, deadpans, \"And I, as your faithful confidant, am ready to listen and to give you my honest opinion of how impossible your idea is.\" August pauses for a moment and then begins, \"You and I are quite fortunate. For many reasons, but specifically because of our professions are required by the citizens. Our respective businesses thrive, first and foremost, people have a need for them.\" Thomas nods, \"Agreed.\" \"Imagine, then, the importance of one local business that could meet, not just one, but two public needs.\" \"That would be ideal!\" Thomas admitted. \"Can I assume that you know of a business that can make such a claim?\" \"I believe I do. You and I have neighbors and associates who earn a decent living. Many would eagerly invest some of their money, if only someone offered them a reasonable return on their investment.\" \"True enough.\" \"On the other hand,\" August continued, \"we both have friends or clients who earn a decent living, and dream of owning a home. They would gladly pay a premium, if only someone offered them a loan that could be paid over an extended period of time.\" \"Indeed they would!\" \"Here, then, are two services that are mutually supportive, and that can be addressed by one institution.\" Thomas summarizes, \"So, 'Citizen A' invests and gets a return, and 'Citizen B' gets their own home and repays 'Citizen A' with interest. \"And as a result we have more homeowners\". \"Which means more homes,\" Thomas posits. \"And more jobs because...\" August pauses and Thomas completes, \"Someone has to build all those new homes.\" August closes the logical loop, \"More people getting paid, so more money flows through our fair town, which creates more potential homeowners needing financial assistance.\" Thomas smiles, \"The citizens gain, the town gains and the business gains. Hab, it's a lollapalooza! Pity that it is only an idea.\" \"On the contrary. These institutions do exist. They are springing up around the state. In Buffalo. In Rochester. They are called Building and Loans. And, I believe that someone like you and I could launch a small business like that right here in Bedford Falls!\" Thomas considers the potential name of the new venture, \"The Bedford Falls Building and Loan. It rings of something useful and lasting. I must say that this idea of yours appears to be both practical and achievable. However, my friend, I also believe that our red hot vendor has more available capital than you or I at this moment.\" August considers Thomas's words, \"True. We are in an excellent position to deliver this needed service. But before being loan givers, we must be loan getters.\" \"So, let's pitch your idea to the bank.\" August summarily rejects this suggestion, \"They would likely consider this a speculative venture. Or worst, they would consider us their competition.\" \"Well, if the bank is out, then we need a financial partner to provide us with seed money. Someone who is wealthy, who knows us and would be willing to take a little risk.\" August offers a summary of their resources, \"The bad news is that in this town and with those criteria, we have but two people we can approach.\" \"The good news, though,\" Thomas countered, \"is that both of them will likely be at the festival today.\" \"Two of them, two of us,\" August reasons. \"Here's my proposal: each of us will approach one of them.\" Thomas opines, \"The suggestion is sound. How do we determine the pairings?\" After a moment of thought, the young lawyer asserts, \"In order of encounter. Would you prefer first or second?\" \"First, always!\" says Thomas, with no hesitation. And without hesitation, August sets his friend to task, \"Well then, turn around and have at it.\" Thomas spins to face in the direction that August suggests, and his face immediately reflects despair.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Beneath the shade of a large tree is Henry F. Potter. The miserly mogul, at the turn of the century, has thinning, dark hair, a mustache and his face bears fewer wrinkles. However, his disability remains and his face wears the familiar, sullen scowl. At this moment, Henry sits in his wicker wheelchair, with his assistant nearby. He is talking with, or rather talking at, Bedford Fall's top government official, Mayor Ned Meyer. \"...and you know as well as I do that we overspend on policeman's salaries. 'Increase their budget', you say! Why, the ones we have can't even turn out my deadbeat tenants in a timely fashion...\" August and Thomas witness the exchange from a distance. Thomas shakes his head, \"This just isn't going to work, Hab! My pairing is pointless! I've seen the cure for progress, and its name is Potter.\" August summarizes their predicament, \"Then that leaves us but one option...and lucky day, he appears to be headed in our direction!\" Approaching from the opposite end of the park is the tall gentleman who lives at 320 Sycamore. He greets and is greeted warmly by the townsfolk as they pass. The tall gentleman approaches Potter and the Mayor. Potter's tone is unrelenting, despite the approach of the man from 320 Sycamore, \"…And you would do well to heed my warnings!\" The tall pedestrian tips his hat toward Ned, \"Mayor.\" The mayor, who wears a suit with a wide green sash, responds, \"Good day, Nathan. You are here just in time to hear Henry's critique of my fiscal management.\" Potter cannot prevent himself from correcting the mayor, \"Mis-management, in my opinion! Unfettered malfeasance!\" Tipping his hat now to Henry, Nathan counters, \"Mr. Potter is, if nothing else, generous with his time and his opinions.\" Nathan's words stung, but Potter was not ready to back down, \"Yes. Always the joker. Here you stand, two of the biggest spendthrifts in the state of New York, making sport of me. Here, Nathan, wasn't it two years ago to the day that you outbid me for that tract of unbridled wilderness south of the Falls?\" \"Guilty as charged,\" Nathan admits. Henry pressed his case, \"As I recall, you paid a small fortune. And what have you done with that tract? Nothing! It remains as wild and without value as the day you purchased it.\" Nathan cannot resist a sharp rebuke, \"And, at about the same time, if memory serves, you managed to pry the Harvest Lake area from a still-grieving widow Thoms.\" Potter grumbles and fidgets. Having found a sore spot, Nathan continues to poke at it, \"Which you promptly turned into the largest and most unsightly excavation!\" Nathan chuckles, \"I feared that the Panama Canal was to be routed through Bedford Falls!\" Potter's expression is agitated and indignant. Nathan summarizes with a brutal confession, \"Henry, the only intention I ever had for the property I purchased was to keep it away from you. Having now seen how you can leave your mark in the earth, I believe that I have salvaged both the property's value and dignity.\" Potter, unable to defend himself, retreats in a huff, \"All the hot air around here, someone should open a balloon stand.\" Then, motioning to his hired man he snapped, \"Let's go.\" Granville and the Mayor exchange glances. An assistant to the Mayor appears and whispers in the Mayor's ear, spurring him to action, \"Seems that this festival doesn't run itself. Pardon me, while I dispense with my official duties.\" Granville tips his hat to the Mayor. Kraft and Campbell, who have been waiting in the wings, see that Granville is alone and venture to approach him. Thomas initiates the conversation, 'Good day, Mr. Granville.\" \"And, to you gentlemen,\" Nathan responded. Are you well?\" August, glancing nervously between Thomas and Nathan wastes little time explaining their intrusion, \"Quite well, thank you. If you can spare a few moments, Dr. Campbell and I would like to propose a business venture that we believe will be well received by our community.\" While Nathan did not become wealthy by freely distributing capital, he understood opportunities for wise investments were a matter of awareness and timing. He frequently took interest in the schemes and dreams of his fellow citizens, \"Indeed! I would be interested to hear it. If the day after tomorrow would not be too long to wait, I'll ask you gentlemen and your lovely wives to join Charlotte and I. We will dine, for who can conduct any good business on an empty stomach? Then, after dinner, we'll discuss your initiative.\" Thomas and August seem surprised by Nathan's offer. Thomas grinned, \"Certainly. Thank you, sir!\" Almost simultaneously, August reached forward to shake the entrepreneur's hand, \"It would be our honor!\" As Nathan continues up the path, the two friends laugh and congratulate themselves on their good fortune. The military band reaches a crescendo as Mayor Meyer ascends the steps of the bandstand to the cheers of the townspeople. The mayor raises his hands to quiet the crowd, \"If there ever was a treat for the senses, it is our annual summer celebration: the aroma of Mrs. Meehan's honey-glazed chicken, the sound of sparklers, propelled by the active feet of the Harris and Norquist children, the sight of Mr. Halfort devouring yet another apple turnover from the table of the Glenn sisters.\" Mr. Halfort, his mouth full of pastry, acknowledges the Mayor as laughter ripples through the crowd. The mayor continues, \"We gather to celebrate many things, including our town's rich history. Legends remind us that true leaders often emerge when the need for them is greatest. The legend of Lewis Bedford is a perfect example.\" The two friends, having heard this particular speech before, turn to look at each other, and say simultaneously with a hint of sarcasm, \"Leapin' Looey Bedford!\" He may have given this speech a dozen times or more, yet the mayor was determined to tell this tale as if he were sharing it for the first time, \"Nearly 300 years ago, when Native Americans were the only people who wandered this heavily wooded region, Lewis joined an expedition from Tarrytown as a lowly supply carrier. Incidentally, Lewis did not want to be on this, or any, expedition. He was a lad raised in the city, but left to escape trouble with local authorities. As the expedition progressed further into uncharted lands, the top three expedition leaders fell ill and died. The remaining group were uncertain regarding how to proceed. They quarreled. As the entire expedition faced certain calamity, Lewis – a lad of only sixteen, and a greenhorn - leapt into action. When he led his group to safety over yonder hills and into this placid valley, he was honored as a hero!\" Thomas was very familiar with the mayor's speaking style. As the crowd cheered, he looked at August and began a countdown, \"Three, two, one.\" Then the mayor and the two compadres said simultaneously, \"Let us never forget, let us never forget!\" August chuckled, \"And, let us never forget, my good man, that if we don't soon return to the spot where we left our families, we may be forced to leave town like ol' Leapin' Looey.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 August and Emily Kraft arrive at 320 Sycamore at dusk. Warm light spills from the house onto the porch. The windows are all open to allow the cool evening breeze to pass through. The main door is also open, and through the screen door, wonderful odors of home cooked food beckon. Charlotte Granville greets the guests, \"Dr. Campbell told us your timing is impeccable.\" August asks, \"He's here already?\" Charlotte responds, \"Indeed\". She leads the Krafts to the dining room where everyone is already seated. The Krafts are met with greetings all around. Nathan, ever-inquisitive, sits at the head of the table dispensing questions and listening intently. As anyone who has the good fortune of spending an evening with enjoyable company can attest, time speeds up. With the meal finished and the laughter abundant, Nathan rose, \"Ladies, if you won't be offended, Thomas, August and I have some business to discuss.\" The Charlotte, Emily and May spend a fraction of a moment acknowledging their departure, then immediately return to their banter. Nathan makes light of the situation, \"Gentleman, you can see we will be sorely missed. Please have a seat in the living room, I'll join you shortly.\" Kraft and Campbell make their way back toward the front of the house. As they make a turn at the staircase, a toddler, who has recently learned how to toddle, is excitedly demonstrating his new skill set. Campbell and the onesie-clad bundle of laughter nearly collide. Nathan swoops in from behind and scoops up the youngster. The Granville's nanny, who had been in hot pursuit, appears from around the corner. Nathan hugs the child and passes him off to the nanny. \"My son, Steven,\" Nathan says proudly as the three men enter the living room. Thomas smiles, \"You are quite busy these days. You've your family, your existing businesses, investments and the construction of the new factory. Nathan closes the living room doors, \"Please, gentlemen, have a seat.\" After offering his guests a brandy, which they both accept, Nathan responds to the comment, \"Very true. Still, when two of Bedford Falls' brighter minds ask for my time, I consider it a wise investment. Now, what is this grand proposition you have?\" August sets his snifter on the side table and leans forward to begin his pitch, \"Our interest is in the arena of consumer finances. Consumer lending, to be precise.\" The discussion lasts for the better part of an hour, with Kraft and Campbell describing function and form of their Building and Loan, and with Nathan listening intently and asking specific, pointed questions to determine precisely how invested the duo are in dragging this idea into reality. Then, there came a moment when Nathan ceased asking questions and, instead, sat quietly, as if deep in thought. The silence continued long enough for August to wonder if he and Thomas should not just stand up and leave. At last, Nathan offered his critique, \"Gentlemen, I have concerns. Your plan, on its face is thorough. But, both of you have careers and families. Will you be abandoning your professions and your hard-earned clientele to initiate and manage what appears to be a very time-intensive endeavor?\" Campbell responded, \"No.\" Kraft was a bit more emphatic, \"Definitely not!\" Nathan continued on his train of thought, \"Then, you'll be hiring an employee to manage the daily business affairs on your behalf?\" August and Thomas exchange glances. August responds cautiously, \"We've interviewed a number of people, but can't agree on the type of person who would be right for the job.\" Thomas adds, \"Also, Hab, that is, August and I have placed a high priority on finding the most ideal location. We've spent most of our time comparing office spaces with the best visibility and best ease of access.\" Nathan shakes his head, \"Trust is your quest, gentlemen. Build trust with your public and they will seek you, whether you operate from a warehouse or an outhouse.\" Nathan paused momentarily, then inhaled deeply before continuing, \"But let's take a moment to discuss this new employee. All your new hire has to do is get total strangers to trust him with their hard-earned money. Not a lot to ask of anyone. Nathan's chuckles slightly as he declares, \"Not to put too fine a point on it, but the person you hire is going to have to be a goddamn miracle worker!\" After a moment of silence August glances at Thomas, who mumbles, \"Maybe we need to change our priorities.\" August nods in agreement. Another eon of silence engulfed the room. Tension seemed to escalate with each tick of the mantle clock. Nathan's face, which held no discernible emotion, suddenly brightened, \"Did you enjoy the fair last weekend?\" August replied, \"Of course!\" Nathan then asked, \"Did the mayor, once again, recount the adventures of Lewis Bedford?\" \"Of course!\" Thomas said. Nathan nodded, \"I like that story. I'm very fond of stories with happy endings.\" It is at this moment that Nathan stands, indicating the meeting is near the end. The other two men stand also. Nathan concludes with, \"I'd like to see this one end that way, too. But a happy ending hinges on you finding a trustworthy someone. In short, gentlemen, find yourself a Leapin' Looey and I'll assure that you'll have your startup capital.\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Dr. Campbell stands in the lobby of his office, chatting with a patient. Three men enter. All of them appear to be laborers in their later twenties or early thirties. They wear dungarees or coveralls, t-shirts and work boots. Two of the men are aiding the third who appears to be injured, \"Oh! Ow! Careful!\" Dr. Campbell says, \"What do we have here?\" The laborer who was bearing most of the injured man's weight explained, \"We're part of the construction crew repairing the old fire house. We had an accident at the site. This is our foreman, Mike.\" Mike vocalizes each painful step, \"Ow! Ow!\" \"Easy, now, Mike!\" said his human crutch. \"Bring him through here. Can he walk?\" As they all follow Dr. Campbell from the lobby through the hallway to the examination room, the other laborer responds, \"Not well, by himself.\" Mike gingerly seats himself on the exam table and responds to his coworker with contempt, \"Well, I certainly don't want any help from you!\" Dr. Campbell inspects a small gash on Mike's head, \"Under the circumstances, I would think you'd welcome his assistance.\" Mike gestures at his concerned co-worker, \"From Bill? Huh! He's the reason I'm here!\" Bill reacts to Mike's claim with shock, \"You're blamin' me?\" The other laborer immediately comes to Bill's defense, \"Now Mike, that's not completely true.\" \"No?\" Mike challenged, \"Who was given the task of putting up the scaffolding?\" The other laborer replies, \"You gave Bill the task yourself.\" \"That settles it! It's his fault that it collapsed!\" Bill jumps up and responds angrily, \"I never said I was finished!\" Chaos envelops the exam room as all three co-workers begin talking over each other. Mike grabs his leg in pain, \"Owwwww!\" Dr. Campbell examines Mike's leg injury. \"Stay calm! We'll have to check the leg for possible fractures. Good news is that I see no signs of concussion, just some deep bruising and a little scar we can stitch up right here.\" Mike displays his irritation, and again gestures at Bill. \"Well, whatever damage I have, it's this idiot's fault!\" Bill is hurt by Mike's words. He fumes and exits the exam room. The other laborer quickly steps forward in his friend's defense. Mike cowers, expecting a physical attack. Instead, the laborer stretches out a non-threatening hand. Mike, embarrassed by his own reaction, lowers his arms and timidly shakes the offered hand. \"I want to thank you for giving me and my brother the opportunity to work.\" Mike responds, emphasizing the first word, \"You are welcome...your brother, on the other hand...\" \"You'd have to agree that both my brother and I have worked hard, earned our wages and helped grow a positive reputation for your business.\" Mike responds sheepishly, \"Yes. That is true.\" \"And, it is my hope that your business does just as well without us.\" The laborer releases Mike's hand, then turns and leaves the examination room. Mike is stunned by the reaction and tries to rise, \"But, Pete...owww!\" Dr. Campbell tries to calm the agitated foreman, \"Easy does it, Mike! There's plenty of able help out there.\" Mike appears devastated, \"You don't understand. Peter Bailey is one of the most reliable men I've ever worked with. And clever! Always coming up with ways to save us time and money, he was. Guys like that are in short supply! Thomas squints at the doorway that Peter had just passed through, \"A regular Leapin' Looey, huh?\" Then, returning his attention to his patient, Thomas says, OK, lay back. Let's get you stitched up.\"[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Peter and Billy sit at a table in a bar. The bar is rather quiet. There aren't many patrons since it is mid-day. And the two brothers aren't saying much, either. Bill faces the table, but his chair back is between the table and him. He is focused on the foam in his beer mug as he sits hunched over, leaning forward on the chair back for support. Peter sits with a leg up on a chair, staring at his shoe. In to this island of inertia strides Dr. Campbell. He makes his way over to where the brothers sit, \"Hello Peter...Bill.\" Bill, eyes still on his mug, raises his hand in a feeble attempt at a wave. Peter kicks his chair toward the doctor, \"Hi Doc. Have a seat.\" Dr. Campbell sits as Peter airs a concern, \"A little early for a professional such as yourself to be drinking, isn't it?\" \"You rushed out of the clinic so fast, I didn't get a chance to check you for injuries. So, how are the two of you?\" Peter shrugs, \"You mean besides unemployed? OK, I guess.\" \"I deserved that,\" the doctor says, leaning forward. \"Can't say that I've ever felt cheated being an only child. That is until a few minutes ago. I can only imagine how proud I'd be to have a brother like Peter to back you up in a tough situation.\" Peter acknowledges the complement by raising his mug in a half-hearted toast. Bill asks, without raising his head or his eyes, \"How did you know where we'd be?\" The doctor replies, \"I checked the library first and they sent me here. Kidding aside, what's your plan? What will you and Bill do now?\" Bill, raises his head, proving it is not stapled to the chair back, \"Oh, don't worry about us. We can get another construction job, right Pete? After all, I'm only thirty.\" Peter matter-of-factly corrects Bill, \"Thirty-one.\" Dr. Campbell shakes his head, \"Construction labor is a taxing job, even for a young man.\" Bill straightens and responds to the doctor in a defensive tone, \"And, I suppose you're trying to make us feel better?\" \"I assure you, I meant no disrespect.\" Peter attempts to defuse the tense situation, \"Maybe not. Look, it's been a tough day.\" Bill rises from his chair and mutters in disgust, \"I'm going for another beer.\" \"Yeah, and for me, eh Billy?\" \"Peter, I'm sorry that you lost your job. However, you know that old saw that starts 'When one window closes...'?\" Peter displays his sharp wit, \"You hope your neck isn't under it!\" Dr. Campbell responds with a chuckle, \"Peter, I may have a new window for you.\" Peter squints at the doctor, \"Doc, I'm no medical student. I can assume you're not here to fit me for a white coat. So, what is it? You want me to create more accidents...send you more patients?\" \"Actually, I have more than I can handle these days. Peter, I and a local lawyer, Mr. Kraft, are starting a new business and I'd like you to consider running it. And, as far as your background, I assure you, you are well qualified.\" \"For what?\" Dr. Campbell leans further forward, \"Do you get satisfaction from your construction jobs, putting roofs over people's heads?\" Peter nods while displaying a look that can only be read, \"Of course!\" \"Then, imagine, gaining all the satisfaction without lifting anything heavier than a ledger!\" Peter sits up, \"This window of yours, is it legal?\" \"More than legal. It's noble.\" \"Doc, you have my attention.\" In front of the Granville fireplace, Kraft and Granville converse while enjoying an alcoholic beverage. \"Naturally, Peter had questions about the process, but once Thomas and I provided some detail, we had Peter's commitment.\" Nathan nodded his head, \"You have mine. And Bedford Falls has a Building and Loan.\" Nathan rises and speaks as Thomas enters, \"Oh, there you are Thomas. Gentlemen, a toast, To our joint venture!\" Setting his glass down, Nathan continues, \"Peter is, I admit a curious choice. The town is full of folks with managerial or financial backgrounds.\" August responds, \"That would have been the safe bet. Still, Doc's got confidence in him. And I'm beginning to understand why. The business aspects...the bookkeeping, the business management. That's something Tom and I can provide guidance. Peter, though, has something that can't be taught. Peter seems to be genuinely interested in helping people.\" Nathan nods in agreement, Mr. Bailey will undoubtedly gain from your guidance. Certainly, no one who stands alone can be successful. Thomas offers, \"Excluding you, of course.\" \"Me most of all!\" Thomas says, \"I'm sure that you have your advisers, however...\" \"I need but one. And she sits in the room across from us.\" Kraft asks for clarification, \"Charlotte?\" \"I get confound by the way of the world, just like everyone. When I do, Charlotte always asks me the same question.\" Nathan sits up and clears his throat, preparing to deliver a familiar quote, 'What reason were we given this gift of one more good day, if not for the promise of one more good deed?'\" Charlotte is aware of Nathans playful mockery. She gives him a wry smile and a sidelong glance. Nathan relaxes his posture and recovers his normal tone, \"She has a way of putting it all in perspective.\" Then, after a pause, Nathan adds, \"Really chaps my ass!\" \"In all seriousness, there are few decisions that I have made without consulting her first. And, I assure you that the few times that I did not, those projects ended badly. Without her in my life, I could not be who I am. Campbell shouts across the hall to be heard, \"A toast then, to the secret of your success!\" All three men raise their glasses toward Charlotte, who is stacking dishes in the cupboard. Charlotte acknowledges them by smiling and curtsying. Campbell then turns to Kraft, \"So, my Building and Loan pal, we have created something useful. But will it be lasting?\" Kraft, ever pragmatic, responds, \"My friend, only time will tell how far these events will propel us.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 The curious bowler wearing visitor walks along a residential street in Bedford Falls. He looks around wearing a look of confusion. He is singing lyrics from \"The Whiffenpoof Song\", \"We are poor little lambs who have lost our way, baa, baa, baa. We are little black sheep who have gone astray, baa, baa, baa. Could use a guide, here.\" At that moment, a priest passes through the gate of the rectory to the sidewalk, in front of the pedestrian. He then greets the priest, \"Hello, padre!\" \"Hello to you!\" returns the clergyman. \"Blessed morning, isn't it! You are from out of town, I take it? I know most of the locals.\" The priest sticks out his hand, \"I'm Father Joseph.\" \"Right you are. I'm not from these parts. I'm Blue Bodaline,\" says the pedestrian as he shakes the hand of the priest. \"Do you have a moment to spare?\" asks Blue. \"Certainly. Tell me your troubles, my son.\" \"Can we talk shop? As a man of the cloth, you encounter non-believers every day.\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"Well, let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say I was from the other side, the afterlife...\" \"Oh, like an angel.\" \"Of that persuasion, yes. And I was sent here to try and convince a specific person that there are post-life destinations.\" The father, listening intently says, \"Go on.\" \"But this particular person is very materialistic.\" The clergyman interjects, \"Oh, those are the tough customers!\" \"So, how do you think one would break the news to him...get him to see the light, so to speak.\" The father ponders the question, then offers, \"Like any Good Shepard, I suspect you would want to share the Good Word with the unfortunate fellow. \"Good Word...ok.\" \"It is our bond with the Almighty, our contract.\" \"Contract... contract! Hey Padre, that is a great idea!\" Blue reaches out to shake the reverend's hand. The reverend replies, \"You are welcome, my son!\" In the process a leaf of paper falls from the clergyman's pocket to the sidewalk. Blue bends to retrieve the horse racing form, \"Looks like you dropped your tip sheet.\" Sheepishly, Father Joseph admits, \"Spring meet at Belmont.\" \"Any good prospects?\" \"Oh, I've a sure winner in the 5th. Of course, all winnings go to the Orphan's Fund!\" Blue reaches into his pocket and extracts a five dollar bill, \"Well, here's a little cabbage for the garden.\" Father Joseph graciously accepts the money, \"Thank you, my son.\" \"Don't mention it. It's a good investment.\" \"Truly! Better than the bank, anyway,\" The clergyman leans in to tell Blue a secret. Blue reacts the secret with shock, \"You don't say!\" The priest glances around for assurance that they are alone, \"But you didn't hear it from me!\" \"Mums the word,\" promises Blue. \"The corner of Pine and Harrison is just up here, isn't it?\" \"Pine and Harrison?\" Father Joseph points over Blue's shoulder, \"Back towards town, four blocks down and two blocks over.\" The priest then pockets his tip sheet and walks back to the rectory, whistling. August and Thomas motor along the streets of Bedford Falls. Campbell is impatient for the information that Kraft had promised, \"That's twice that we've circled past my office. Are you ready to share the news or shall we make another pass?\" \"Someone is about to purchase the factory.\" \"Great news! Do we know who that someone is?\" \"I do.\" \"Well, then, who is it?\" \"I'm not sure you'll believe me.\" Campbell stops the vehicle in front of Dr. Campbell's office. August pauses. Staring at Thomas, he replies with a single word, \"Potter.\" \"Henry F.?\" Thomas asks with disbelief. \"You're right, I don't believe you. Are you certain?\" \"Yes.\" \"What would possess Henry Potter to do something so noble?\" August offers an evasive, \"Circumstances.\" \"How did you find out?\" \"I'm involved.\" \"And now I'm concerned. August, you and I have known Henry for a long time. What would possess you to help a man who thinks only of himself? Many men have staked their reputation on a Potter promise. All that I know have regretted that decision. What makes you believe that this time is any different?\" \"Thomas, it pains me to see this town, these proud people laid low. I'm worried about today, but I'm also worried about the future. I fear that unless something is done in the present, the effects of this economic calamity will last generations! I tell you now that I would make a deal with the devil himself if it meant the resurrection of Bedford Falls.\" As Dr. Campbell exits the car, August opines, \"I have no more trust in Potter than I've ever had. But, what I do have is a signed contract. And, I...\" August decides against telling his friend the entire story. \"I'm willing to leverage my reputation to give our community a chance to succeed. It was good to see you again, Doc!\" Thomas offers his friend a cautious wish, \"Best of luck to you, August. May your trust not be abused.\" August smiles, nods and drives away. Inside the congressman's office, it is void of human activity. The contract remains in the tray, on his desk by the open window. Just outside the window, the top of a bowler hat can be seen. Smoke rises up around the hat. A semi-gloved hand reaches in under the open window sill and removes the Tool and Machine Works contract from the tray. As Blue walks away, a faded advertisement on a nearby brick wall promotes \"Larkin Soap\".[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 From the street view of the Larkin Soap Company, it is a cold winter day in the early 1900's. Traffic is mostly horse-drawn carriage and the style of dress is distinctly Late Victorian. Two of the pedestrians walking near the corner store are the younger Kraft and Campbell. They barely pause in their animated conversation to enter the shop. Once inside, they both greet Larkin's head clerk, Sebastian. Then they resume their discussion as they make their way to the small back room which is the main (and only) office of the Bedford Falls Building and Loan. The dynamic duo burst into the 10' x 12' room, continuing their heated exchange. August insists, \"No, no. Not irresponsible! More complicated, perhaps but…\" Thomas counters with, \"You have your practice, your family, the Building and Loan. And you want to take on additional challenges? I'd advise caution!\" August responds, \"But you must admit, it is a goal that can be accomplished!\" The two realize suddenly that they have interrupted a business meeting between Peter and a potential customer. Peter glares at the now silent and embarrassed pair. Campbell finds a chair amid the drawers, bookcases and paper-laden tables and humbly takes a seat. Peter picks up from where his presentation was interrupted, \"Yes, besides providing another way for you to invest, our institution provides you with a way of building our community, helping your neighbors form solid roots...we look forward to doing business with you.\" The customer thanks Peter and exits. August says, \"Still scaring away prospects, I see.\" Peter returns to his desk and begins writing, \"We've had this discussion. You can't just distribute credit without providing guidance and education.\" \"Pour me another cup of wisdom, bartender\" \"I also answer to 'babysitter' these days. If you're here about the financial stability of your creation, you needn't worry. I'm losing money hand over fist.\" Thomas says \"Without help? Impressive!\" \"On the contrary, our advertising manager is asking for a raise.\" August looks perplexed, \"Advertising?\" Peter points to the small window that offers a view of Grant Avenue. Thomas and August both converge at the window. Just outside, Bill walks the street, cheerfully greeting people and handing out flyers. Over his shoulders hangs a sandwich board advertising the Bedford Falls Building and Loan with the offer \"Own Your Own Home\", and on his head, worn like a hat is miniature model house. August turns to leave and quips, \"I had no idea that Craig's has a sale! Say, Doc, we should stop by there on the way to the County Court House.\" Thomas says, \"Not so fast, August. Peter is a card-carrying member of the teeming masses, let's get his opinion. \"I don't think...\" Peter asks warily, \"What is this about?\" Thomas replies, \"August has political aspirations.\" At just that moment, there is a knock on the door. Peter answers, and greets a couple. \"Good day, Mr. and Mrs. Abel, please have a seat by the window.\" Campbell waits for Peter's response, \"Well, what do you think of that?\" Peter gestures they should leave, \"Fine. Fine. Good luck! Now, will the two of you please do your aspirating elsewhere?\" Thomas insists, \"But, Peter, this concerns you!\" Peter, while pushing his mentors out the door, says, \"I am concerned! Whatever you have might be catching! Now go!\" Peter turns to the couple, \"So you have reviewed the documents. What questions do you have for me?\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 The younger, mustachioed Henry Potter visits Mayor Meyer at the County Courthouse, the mayor sits behind his desk, shaking his head at the mogul, \"Henry, do you have a conscience?\" Mayor's assistant knocks on the door. The mayor gestures for her to enter. She enters and hands the mayor a large piece of paper, \"The pressman just sent over these drafts.\" Mayor Meyer reviews a campaign poster with his smiling face on it. The mayor looks very pleased, but abruptly stops smiling as Potter resumes speaking, \"I assure you, Clayton, I did not come all the way down here to be brushed aside! I demand my rezoning plan be introduced and voted on at the next meeting of the town council.\" The mayor puts the campaign poster aside and leans forward, \"And I assure you that this scheme of yours would be a catalyst for chaos!\" \"Hogwash! The law in question has been on the books for years. Any citizen could have employed it!\" The mayor shot back, \"Any citizen without a soul!\" Potter points at the document in front of him, \"After a simple decree from you or the council, the vacant tracts of land listed here would henceforth be considered commercial property. The county charter clearly states that the first person who registers for the newly zoned properties becomes the legal owners.\" \"Insidious!\" fumes the mayor. \"Will I gain from this correction? Yes. However, thus is by no means a completely one-sided arrangement! Consider the benefits to the town! A much needed boost to the real estate market and, a guaranteed revenue increase for local government coffers.\" Potter winks at Mayor Meyer. \"Henry, you astound me. If its land you want, why not bid for it? Look at Nathan Granville!\" Potter instinctively turns and grimaces when he hears his rival's name. The mayor continues, \"He approaches landowners with a fair price for a tract of land. If the owners want to negotiate, he'll negotiate. He, too, seeks a profit, but he works with and on behalf of the community. He's raised a factory, started businesses, created jobs. He's building a small empire and a mountain of goodwill in Bedford Falls. Meanwhile, you're looking for holes in the fence that you can crawl through to cheat people out of what's rightly theirs. Potter turns back to face the mayor and defends himself, \"Now just a minute!\" The mayor, however, interrupts and gives it to Henry with both barrels, \"You'd actually have me void the deeds of the current legal landowners! You demand that I force your poisoned idea through because your land grab doesn't have enough support on the city council. Well, Henry, I hope your plan has an insurance policy, because it dies right here.\" Potter bristles, \"Then, Mr. Mayor, I suggest you cancel that order for campaign posters. And, while you are at it, call up your friend Nathan, tell him you may be interested in the Floor Sweeper position at the factory, because I'll be putting my full and generous support behind a new candidate!\" Inside the main area of the ground floor of the County Courthouse, Thomas and August approach the teller window. A male teller greets them, \"Good day gentlemen, how can I help?\" Thomas responds, \"We're here about the permanent business licenses for the Bedford Falls Building and Loan.\" The teller pauses for a moment, then walks away to search for the appropriate documents. Kraft scans the lobby of the government building. His eyes are drawn to the numerous portraits of former city and county office holders. August retells stories about these representatives of Bedford Falls to Thomas, \"Did you know that Benjamin Hurst was the town mailman before he sought office?\" \"And Maxwell Mallet worked in the meat house. Regular guys with regular jobs who decided to take a chance and speak up for their friends and neighbors.\" Potter, on the mezzanine above the teller's window, rolls by and stops momentarily to adjust his clothing. His ears perk up as he hears Campbell and Kraft converse. Thomas says, \"I know the names, but their histories are mysteries. Still, I would not be shocked to discover that each of those illustrious gentlemen had the assistance of a political professional. Someone who mentored them as they campaigned.\" Thomas pauses to look August up and down, \"You are a man of ideas, and I have to hand it to you, this one has \"supremely irrational\" written all over it. However, if you are going to commit it, then you should do it sooner, rather than later.\" The Teller returns with the forms and August accepts them, \"Thank you. Where would one register as a candidate for the next election?\" The teller asks, \"For which office?\" \"City Council.\" The teller responds, \"City Council? That form is right here.\" The teller disappears for a moment, then returns, \"Here you are. Just return the completed forms to me with signatures and the appropriate fees.\" Kraft receives the document, thanks the clerk and speaks to his friend in an ominous tone, \"And now for the most difficult of challenges.\" \"Campaigning?\" August shakes his head, \"Returning home to get approval from 'The Boss'.\" Potter watches from the mezzanine as Kraft and Campbell exit City Hall.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 Inside the Larkin soap company Victor, the store manager, is dusting the goods on the back wall shelf behind the counter. The door of the store flies open and Sebastian, the store's chief clerk, enters in a state of panic. He slams the door behind him. Victor voices his concern, \"Sebastian, have you lost your mind?\" Sebastian scurries to the counter and whispers to Victor in a frightened tone, \"It's her!\" Victor demands, \"Her who?\" \"You remember the lady who made the florist break down in tears last week?\" \"Yes.\" \"That 'her'.\" Victor acknowledges that he understands by nodding in time with Sebastian and by releasing a long, \"Ohhhhhhh!\" At that moment, Margaret Sullivan, in her late twenties, bursts into the store. Sebastian disappears into the aisles of products, while Victor pins his back to the store shelves and stares, wide-eyed at the maelstrom in front of him. Margaret scans the store, sees Victor and says to him in a demanding tone, \"Building and Loan!?\" Victor quickly points to the back of the store. Margaret trundles off in the direction suggested. Victor gives a sigh of relief. Peter Bailey is alone inside the Building and Loan office, filing books, until Margaret enters and slams the door behind her. It's clear she's boiling mad. Peter turns to face the source of the noise, \"May I help you?\" \"Peter Bailey, I presume?\" Margaret says curtly. Peter's response is an understandably tentative, \"Yes.\" \"The same Peter Bailey who's been advertising all about town: 'Now's the time! Build your own home! Let us help!'?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well I've got a thing or two to tell you, Mr. Big Shot.\" Peter, perplexed at the stranger's derisive tone, takes a seat as Margaret continues her tirade, \"Who gives you the right to give some people loans and deny other people like they were second class citizens? It's inhuman and humiliating and down-right wrong!\" Peter shakes his head, \"I have to apologize...\" \"You'll have to do more than that!\" \"I meant, I'm sorry, but I don't recognize you, Mrs...\" \"Miss, if you please. Miss Margaret Sullivan.\" \"I don't recall you applying for a loan here, Miss Sullivan.\" Margaret continues her rant, \"Not me! My father. He came in here believing your-believing that you could help him. And what did you do? You turned him down flat. Why, he came away from here feeling worse than he ever did. Why, I've got a mind to...\" Peter locates the file that contains Mr. Sullivan's information. \"Aha! John Thomas Sullivan.\" \"That's Mr. Sullivan to you. What kind of secret society must one join to get a loan here, anyway?\" Peter stands and puts his hands on the back of a wooden chair. \"Miss Sullivan, I can tell that you're very interested in protecting your father. Believe it or not, I..that is, the Building and Loan is interested in protecting him also.\" \"Fine talk. You think you are the only place to go to borrow money? Well, you're not! Just a walk up the street and...\" Peter, in an effort to break the continual tongue-lashing, raises the wooden chair and slams it forcefully to the floor. The loud noise has the intended effect. Margaret stares silently at Peter. Peter rubs his neck and smiles, \"Miss Sullivan, please have a seat.\" \"I don't see what...\" \"Five minutes. Give me five minutes of your attention. If, after that time, you still doubt the integrity of the Building and Loan, I will walk with you over to the police station and turn myself in.\" Margaret squints at Peter, \"Five minutes?\" \"Starting now. But, I need you to think of the Building and Loan...of me, as something other than just a lender of money.\" Peter offers the chair to Margaret, who tentatively takes a seat. Peter also sits, \"People come to us with goals and dreams. Sometimes we can help them, sometimes we can't. However, I don't let anyone who walks through that door leave here without knowing what other options are available.\" Peter opens the folder in front of him and gestures at it. \"Now, your father could borrow a lot of money for a new home, but then it's likely he would carry this debt to his grave, at which time it becomes a burden to the rest of the family, including you.\" Margaret leans back in her chair, her posture and demeanor become less defensive, as Peter presses his case, \"Meanwhile, for a fraction of the cost he can make a few repairs to the home he's in, live very comfortably...without that burden of debt hanging over him.\" Peter lifts a document from the folder and passes it to Margaret for her inspection. \"I went so far as to provide your father with the names of several men that I've worked with. They provide good quality repair work and don't overcharge.\" Bill Bailey enters, and seeing that his brother with a customer, tiptoes to the filing cabinets against the far wall and opens a drawer and deposits a folder. \"So, Miss Sullivan, should I get used to prison stripes?\" \"Not on my account. May I keep this information?\" \"Certainly.\" She rises to leave, and walks toward the door. Then turns to face Peter, \"Mr. Bailey?\" Peter and Bill respond simultaneously, \"Yes?\" Bill realizes that Margaret is speaking to Peter. He utters a humble \"Oh!\", and turns to continue his filing. Margaret then asks Peter, \"Do you still occasionally work with this group of maintenance men?\" \"I can stop by to check on their work, if you wish.\" Margaret nods, \"I do.\" She then turns and exits. After she goes, Billy whistles and Peter releases a sigh. Bill, his back to Peter, continues his filing, \"Two of the most dangerous words in the single man's language. It's been a bad year for bachelors, Pete. Wilkerson, Danforth, Alex, the mailman. All of them, lost. Gone over to the other side. You know, you and I, we have to keep an eye on each other...\" Billy turns back to face Peter, who stares into space, oblivious to his brother's banter, \"Before it's...too late.\"[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 The impressive mansion of Henry Potter occupies several acres in the affluent northwest corner of town. It took Blue Bodaline a little more than half an hour to find it. During this time, he fretted over his introduction. As Henry's residence comes in sight, Blue summarizes his plan of attack, \"Yep. I'll just wing it, like I always do.\" The local mailman, leather mailbag slung over his shoulder, strides by Blue. Blue offers a hardy \"Good Morning!\" as he passes. The mailman turns to reply, but Blue has vanished. Henry is alone at his desk in his office. He is intensely focused on something directly in front of him. The room is quiet except for the ticking of a grandfather clock. He has a pen in hand and is about to sign a check that is made out to the City of Bedford Falls for three hundred thousand dollars. The tick-tock of the clock seems to get louder. Henry glances at the clock, then back at the check. His hand shakes uncontrollably as he tries to sign. He lifts the pen, then takes a deep breath to try again. The clock ticking gets louder still. Again, he falters. He tosses the pen aside. He grumbles something inaudible. He appears quite agitated. He slams a desk drawer closed. Then, lunging forward, he grabs the small statue of Napoleon from his desk and hurls it at the clock. The shattering of glass, the clunk of a solid object making contact with the floor and the general disruption of silence that was expected did not ensue. Instead, the statuette came to rest in the hand of a bowler-clad stranger, who had been present long enough to witness Henry's fit. Using Henry's stunned silence to his advantage, Blue says, \"Not a good idea to throw your paper weight around, generally speaking.\" After a brief glance at the object in his hand, Blue amends his original statement, \"Then again, this isn't General Lee, is it?\" As he moves toward Potter, Blue references the top of the statuette, \"Lee didn't own a funny hat like this.\" \"Who are you and what are you doing in my office?\" Henry snapped. \"I'm Blue Bodaline and I'm here for our business meeting.\" \"What?\" Blue places the statuette on Potter's desk, cups his hands around his lips, forming a makeshift megaphone and shouts, \"Our business meeting!\" \"Meeting, you say?\", Potter mocks Blue as he lifts the handset of the telephone, \"The only meeting you'll have is with our local police. Breaking and entering. Trespassing. Armed and Dangerous.\" \"My mistake Henry. I assumed that you wanted to find a way out of your current jam. But, if you are so eager to sign away that six-figure sum, I'll wish you good luck with your expensive new venture, and I'll see myself out.\" Potter pauses mid-dial, \"And just what do you know about my current jam?\" \"I know you are desperate to find an excuse for bailing on the deal you've been forced into.\" \"Henry Potter is never desperate!\" \"No?\" Blue challenges, \"You've got a lot of books in this room. I assume you like stories. Well here's a good one. Four weeks ago August Kraft revealed that he had some dirt on a local, very shameless mogul. He knew that if the people of this town found out about the tycoon's embarrassing past, they'd run said entrepreneur out of town on a rail. So, August offered a trade: the information would remain buried, so long as the man with the deep pockets agreed kept the factory in the green.\" \"Some story,\" says Potter as he shifts nervously in his chair. \"It gets better\", replied the man in the bowler. \"You agreed, Henry, but then you spent three weeks trying to find an out that didn't bankrupt you or make the situation worse. Then, last week, after realizing that no options remained, a desperate Henry Potter made his opening offer to us.\" \"Which offer was that?\" \"For your soul, Henry!\" August parks and walks to the print shop where he greets the print shop manager. A couple of young people dressed in school band uniforms arrive. He asks if they brought the street map. One of the students extracts a map from his back pocket. \"That is what you said Henry.\" In your hour of need, you said 'I would trade my soul to get out from under this mess'. Naturally, we couldn't resist an opportunity to meet. \"What do you mean, we? You got a mouse in your pocket?\" \"I mean we, as in the collective of the damned. I am from Hell and I am here to discuss a solution to your specific predicament.\" \"You are an escapee from the sanitarium.\" \"Henry! Hear what I have to say to you! Time is short. Less than an hour, if I'm right. Tell me to go, and I will go. But when I leave, I'll return to perdition and I take with me your hope that you can make a graceful exit from this meshuggah.\" \"Don't look like much of a demon. Not much of a deal-maker either. All you have is hearsay information that supposedly only I possess and 'Hocus-Pocus' that makes you a fallen angel.\" \"Who else know about this grand plan but you and August? \" \"Gossip runs rampant in this town. Around here, people leak like sieves. You are a fraud, sir. Well, informed, but a fraud, nonetheless.\" \"Blue tips his hat and bows, revealing his demon's horns, \"Touch them Henry. They are real.\" \"The hell, you say.\" \"My point exactly.\" Henry reaches for the phone for a second time, \"I'd wager the local authorities would be interested in hearing about your origins.\" \"And, I'd wager there are not many people who know the truth about your disability. The reason you are crippled is because…\" \"I was in the calvary…\" Blue dramatically jabs a finger upwards and shouts, \"Preposterous prevarication!\" \"I didn't catch that.\" Leaning forward on Potter's desk, Blue changed his tone to an aggravated whisper, \"Liar, liar pants on fire!\" \"A horse crippled me!\" Blue pushes off from the desk, his voice raised, \"Your vanity crippled you, Henry! You were a child showing off for your friends. You had no riding skills. And you had no business mounting any horse, let alone one that large.\" Potter's silence was a clear indication that Blue's words were having their desired effect. Now came Blue's favorite moment: affirmation of guilt, \"Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate? \" \"What's your point?\" Across town, August stands outside the Weiss Print Shop, coordinating elements of a rapidly conceived advertising campaign. The proverbial eye of the storm, August directs his many assistants, ambitious students from Bedford Falls High School. Some are members of the band, dressed in their uniforms and practicing their instruments. Others are in their school uniforms. To the student coordinator, August cautions, \"Make sure each of your team has enough flyers. Your group will follow behind the band and provide the handouts to pedestrians. He then pivots to instruct the band leader, \"You'll have your group ready to go down at the east end of Genesee. You'll start playing and marching at 12:15 sharp. Once you get to the County Court House, you'll make your way up to the factory. OK. Any questions? Great! Let's go and spread the good news!\" Blue sighs, \"I'm not here to judge, Henry. I'm here on business. You made an offer, and I'm here to arrange terms of agreement. As I mentioned, you are one our priority projects. Somewhat of a legend, actually.\" \"And that's why you are here? To barter for my soul?\" \"Your soul, no. Your soul, Henry, is like a gift from Gimbels, it has been boxed, wrapped and tagged. It's just waiting to be collected.\" \"Oh, it is?\" \"You have doubts? Need a reminder? OK. The name 'Letitia LoPresto' should ring a bell. Although I believe she calls herself…\" Potter, with a far off look in his eye, helps Blue finish the sentence. They both say the name simultaneously, \"Lily.\" \"Honestly, that was a thing of beauty, Henry. I can't tell you how many damned souls earned their horns that day, thanks to you.\" \"Horns? What are you talking about?\" \"The reward system in Hell! You know the old rhyme, don't you? 'Every time a human mourns, another devil gets his horns'? With incentives like that, you can understand that this whole 'economic downturn' has our approval.\" \"Potter begins chuckling, I'm talking to a well-informed shyster who claims he's from hell. Whoever you are, you've got a lot of moxie! What did you say your name was?\" \"Blue.\" \"Yes. Blue. What kind of a family would name a child 'Blue'.\" \"They were first generation American, Henry. Very patriotic. I was their third child. You can guess what the first two were named.\" \"After a lingering pause, Potter spat, \"What am I, a mind-reader?\" \"All-American colors, Henry. 'Blank, blank and blue'.\" Henry chortles, \"Siblings named 'Silver and Gold'? Now I've heard everything!\" \"Spoken like a true patriot, Henry.\" \"A patriot who will be late if…\" No worries, Henry. You will get to your ceremony in good time. I'm sure you are looking forward to all the pomp. You get to be the town good guy, and the town will get back a cornerstone of industry. Not to mention many jobs. Yes, Henry, I wouldn't want to do anything to keep you from your big, beautiful red-letter day.\" \"Bite your tongue!\" Potter barks, \"You know damn well that I want nothing to do with any of it!\" \"Of course, I know,\" responds Blue who smiles and thinks, \"That is why I'm here!\" Clock strikes 12:15. Band begins to play, students begin to hand out flyers. Blue says, \"Of course I know that the revival of the factory is the last thing you would want to happen.\" \"If I know about Lily, I know about August's extortion. How he found out about Steven Granville is beyond me.\" Henry opines, \"Nosy druggist, no doubt. Another certified town gossip.\" \"What I do know is that August has you over a barrel. But, credit where credit is due, he's got this all worked out. You are being forced to fork over a lot of personal capital. A shot to anyone's wallet is unpleasant. But to use your dough to bail out the favorite institution of your formal rival? That's gotta hurt! And, he's even got you looking like a hero. It would almost be a shame to blow up such a well laid plan.\" \"And whose side did you say you were on?\" \"I'm here at your request.\" \"Well then I request that his well laid plan is laid waste.\" \"Sure. Let's talk specifics. You've got a proverbial gun to your head and you want it gone.\" \"Yes. And without having to pay a price, like getting sued or going to jail. \" \"Not impossible.\" \"In just over an hour?\" Blue pauses before responding, \"Now that's a tall order. But, if I can deliver, would you be willing to deal?\" Potter hedges, \"Possibly.\" \"You'd owe me a pretty big favor.\" \"Well, Blue, I say you are a first class fraud who has many well-informed friends.\" \"Then give this fraud a chance to prove himself.\" The sun streams in from a nearby window. Blue's shadow spills across Potter's desk. Blue produces a legal document and places it in front of Henry.\" \"Standard contract, Henry. It maintains that if I deliver what you ask, you owe me a favor.\" \"What favor is that?\" \"Like the contract says, to be determined.\" \"And if you can't deliver?\" \"Then the contract is void. Pretty hard to resist. It's a tailor-made solution. \" Potter hesitates. \"We have a deal, just sign on the line.\" Blue then reaches for the contract, adding, \"Or don't. I'm sure you have plenty of other options.\" As Blue tries to remove the contract from Potter's desk, Henry places his hand on the contract to prevent it from being removed. Blue relinquishes his grip on the contract. Potter again hesitates. Blue moves to his right and as a result, his shadow spills across the desk and on to the contract. \"It's a game changer, Henry,\" Henry squints at Blue, who now appears to Henry as a silhouette, then back at the contract. As Henry rubs his chin in contemplation, Blue summarizes the situation, \"You were a man in deep water, with no land in sight.\" The bottom of the contract has a blank line and the name \"Henry F. Potter\" typed underneath. Blue continues, \"And now, your ship has come in.\" Henry, again rubs his chin, as Blue adds the sarcastic caveat, \"Provided you have enough brains to climb aboard!\" Henry's gaze shifts to the quill pen which lies next to the paper. His hand lies within reach of the pen. Blue then poses a taunting question, \"Moment of truth, Henry. What will your decision be?\" Henry stares at the contract, then at Blue, then at the contract again. Henry reaches for the quill pen in the ink jar and begins to write something in the middle of the contract. Once he's finished, Blue picks the contract up and reads Potter's addendum. Blue looks at Potter, \"I still say you are a fraud and nothing will come of this.\" As he put the contract back on the desk, Blue replies, \"You drive a hard bargain, Henry.\" Henry dips his pen in the well to sign, but Blue stops him. He points to the tip of his finger, \"We require a more durable liquid\", and then points at the contract. \"Very theatrical.\" Henry complies. He opens his desk, finds a pushpin and a new pen. He pricks his finger with the pushpin, allowing a few drops to land at the bottom of the contract. He then picks up the new pen and traces a reasonable facsimile of his signature in the pool of red.\" Potter looks down at his pocket watch, \"Well, the clock is ticking and you are still...\" Potter looks up again and stares blankly at the vacant chair in which Blue had been sitting.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 Henry Potter, the younger, sits behind his large ornate wooden desk staring vacantly at the empty chair in front of him. He responds to a knock on his door with a gruff, \"Enter!\" His footman cracks the door open, pokes his head inside, \"August Kraft here to see you.\" Potter responds. \"Show him in!\" August carefully enters Potter's study and looks around at the expensive surroundings. Then he steps toward Henry with an open hand, \"Hello, Mr. Potter. I appreciate the invitation. I believe I'm on time.\" Henry shakes August's hand, \"You are, indeed, Mr. Kraft. Oh, by all means, sit, sit!\" \"What legal advice can I help you with?\" \"Legal advice?\" \"I assumed that was the reason for our meeting.\" \"August, I recently had a conversation with the mayor. It's a conversation that I think you'd find very interesting.\" \"He told me he was reviewing the paperwork for a number of candidates running for a seat on the Town Council, including yours.\" Kraft shuffled nervously, \"I hope he found everything in good order.\" Potter continued, \"The mayor relies on stalwart citizens such as myself for advice. He asked for my honest assessment of you.\" Kraft looks perplexed as Potter continues, \"And I gave him my honest assessment. I told him in no uncertain terms that here is a perfect example of the type of person who can help revitalize the stodgy image of our Town Council!\" Receiving praise from this purported curmudgeon was disarming to the young lawyer, \"In all my years, I...can't remember speaking more than two words to you.\" \"But I know of you. Good reputations are difficult to maintain. Yours is stellar. Family man, business sense, generally well-liked. And now, this solid citizen is interested in becoming a public servant.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, when the topic is politics, what talks is money. Tell me, do you have a campaign plan?\" \"Nothing formal. I thought I would walk around town, shake some hands, let people know I was on the ballot.\" \"Do you have a war chest? Do you have a plan for fund-raising? An 'A-list' of contributors?\" \"I...\" \"Not to worry. Your political problems have been solved. I will be your campaign manager, handle your campaign finances, arrange promotions, and the rest.\" \"Mr. Potter, you could be spending your time on so many other projects...\" \"Indeed, there are many local candidates who have asked for my help in this election cycle, but I've been waiting for an underdog, a political unknown such as yourself.\" Potter pauses, gauging Kraft's response, which is cautious. He remains quiet and looks a little perplexed. \"This is a bit of a riddle to me. To have someone of influence working on my behalf is as welcomed as it is unexpected. Are you sure that you want to put resources behind my candidacy?\" \"In politics, governance is business, but elections are sport. August, I tell you that anyone can get an incumbent elected. The challenge is bringing in the new blood. And it's that challenge that drives me.\" Potter pauses and leans forward to make his point, \"Now, are you ready for that challenge?\" In response, Kraft rises and shakes Potter's hand.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: It's a sunny day outside the church. A medium sized group milling in anticipation, all at once, their attention is drawn to the doors of the church. Out rush Peter Bailey and the former Margaret Sullivan in their wedding clothes. The crowd cheers and throws rice as the two get into a horse drawn carriage and roll away. August walks up behind Thomas and slaps him on the back, \"So, a Bailey has taken a bride!\" Thomas follows up with, \"And man has learned to fly. Which is more improbable?!\" Both laugh as Nathan Granville approaches them from behind, \"Handsome groom, beautiful bride, splendid ceremony! A good day all around. August and Thomas warmly greet both Nathan and Charlotte. Charlotte says, \"I would wager the whole town has turned out for the happy couple!\" Thomas responded, \"Now there is a bet you would, unfortunately, lose. I know of one fellow we won't see today.\" Nathan queried, \"And who would that be?\" \"Why, Mr. Potter, of course! I can't imagine anyone really notices. His loss is our gain, eh, Hab?\" August chuckles and opens his mouth to add another barb, but decides to hold his tongue, \"Well, he is a busy man.\" \"What? You giving Mr. Potter a pass?\" \"I'd rather not dwell on him, to be honest. If you'll excuse me...\" As Kraft leaves the group, Thomas eyes him with concern.\" Nathan, asks, \"Say, who's minding the store while Peter is honeymooning?\" Thomas replies, \"Oh, that would be our advertising director, Mr. William Bailey.\" Charlotte turns to Thomas, \"Doctor, would you be good enough to snap a photograph of me and my men?\" Thomas agreed and Charlotte handed him the Brownie. Thomas steps back, places the camera against his body, lines up the photo through the viewfinder. Thomas calls out, \"Ready?\" Young Steven stands impatiently between the two elder, smiling Granvilles. Bill Bailey stands, by himself, fidgeting nervously. August strolls up to greet him, \"Hello, Bill. Quite a wedding!\" Bill, responds as if he had been lost in thought, \"Wedding? Yes. Yes, it was.\" Kraft, sensing Bill's unease asks, \"Are you alright?\" \"Yes...uh, no...I don't know.\" August gives Bill a sidelong glance. \"Peter gave me the task of running the Building and Loan for the next few days. Me!\" \"Of course, he trust you.\" \"Think he'll trust me when he returns to find a pool hall instead of a building and loan? I'm petrified I'll make some terrible mistake. You're right what you said about Pete. He's the brother anyone would want. He's always doing for me. I can't help but feel I'm just an anchor holding him back.\" August lets out a hardy chuckle, \"Let me ask you, do you blame yourself for the scaffolding accident?\" \"I don't know. It felt like a setback. A setback I caused.\" \"Interesting. And if it hadn't happened?\" \"We'd probably still be working in construction.\" \"Do you think Peter would rather be hauling around lumber and concrete right now?\" \"Heck, no!\" My back is aching just thinking about it!\" \"So, thanks to your \"setback\", Peter no longer works for Mike.\" \"Yeah. Good riddance! \" \"And, your \"setback\" gave him an opportunity to discover that he's a very effective business manager.\" \"Why, put it that way, I suppose he wouldn't have run into you or Doc Campbell. Or met Margaret... Hey! Peter's best years happened because of me! I'm no anchor!\" Bill is elated at the realization. He reaches over and hugs Kraft. Kraft says, \"And Peter would be the first to agree.\" Bill steps over to the nearest wedding guest and abruptly hugs her, then cheerfully walks away whistling the wedding march.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 As memories go, the wedding of a friend and trusted employee would be one of many that would become treasured to August Kraft. He would always recall those halcyon days fondly. Later in life, he would cling to them like a life preserver when forced to face the misery that reality doles out in generous dollops. As August stood enjoying the warmth of the March sun outside the church, he could not know how heavily he would be leaning on those memories barely ten months later. He would exit those same church doors into a bitter cold January breeze, wearing a black armband on his overcoat as he helped to shoulder the coffin of his business partner and mentor, Nathan Granville. As the long funeral procession wound through town, passing many of Nathan's accomplishments, August pondered the fragility of all human life. It seemed wrong that a good-hearted, strong-willed man like Nathan could be felled by a stroke. And, as August watched the casket being lowered into the grave, the suddenness of the tragic event numbed his mind as thoroughly the winds numbed his flesh. Worst still, the return of spring would not thaw the mental anguish or the sense of loss. August, and so many of the citizens of Bedford Falls, had passed through a dark portal-a marker in time. Though they could look back, they would be moving ever forward, away from that marker and the precious time that preceded it. And yet August's anguish was nothing compared to that of Charlotte Granville. Through winter and spring the house of hope and joy on Sycamore Street remained shuttered and dark. On one pleasant evening in late spring, Dr. Campbell and his wife calls on the darkened, quiet house. The door is answered by Charlotte's sister, \"Hello Dr. Campbell. Mrs. Campbell.\" Thomas removes his hat, \"Hello Celia. Are you well?\" \"Well enough. Wish I could say the same for Charlotte. There hasn't been a smile seen in this house since...Well, if you're here to see her, she's where she always is these days; in the front room, in the dark. Thomas enters and makes his way to the front room which is lit only dimly by a small light. The room is cool and only a few embers glow in the fireplace. A figure sits still in a corner. May releases a groan of sadness and walks toward the figure. \"Charlotte?\" Thomas calls out. The figure stirs and responds to Thomas' voice, \"Thomas? May? Whatever are you doing here?\" Thomas quipped, \"I'm looking for someone who will share this oversized pan of peach cobbler. May is a talented baker, but she still has trouble with proportions.\" \"What time is it? I take what little sleep I can get. But I lose all track of time. Charlotte hangs her head and sobs silently. May takes a seat next to her on the couch, \"You poor dear!\" Charlotte pulls herself together and looks at Celia. Celia asks, \"Should I make some tea?\" Charlotte nods and utters in a tired, monotone, \"All this time...I was aware that I had depended on Nathan. Until now I didn't know just how much.\" Thomas draws a heavy breath. May looks up at Thomas. Thomas sits beside Charlotte and takes her hand, \"If I were from another town, village or country, I might simply empathize with your loss. I, however, am a citizen of Bedford Falls and, Charlotte, I feel this loss very acutely. Indeed, is there anyone in this town who did not lean on the broad shoulders of Nathan Granville?\" Charlotte smiles through her tears. \"He gave his time gladly.\" Thomas rises and responds, \"Indeed. And now, even though this town has asked much of you and your family, I have one more request.\" Thomas takes her hand, and gently pulls. Charlotte rises and follows Thomas to the foyer. As Thomas reaches the front door, he stops and asks Charlotte, \"Would you allow a few of those touched by Nathan's goodness to honor his memory?\" As a response to Charlotte's look of uncertainty, Thomas opens the door. Just outside, August stands, holding a burning candle. He smiles and bows, \"Mrs. Granville.\" Charlotte smiles and begins to welcome August inside. As August gives her a hug and passes by, Charlotte's expression changes. She can now see beyond her doorstep where August's wife, Emily, stands with a lit candle. And, behind her, Peter and Margaret Bailey stand each with a lighted candle. And behind them many others citizens that form a glowing line that stretches out to the side walk, illuminating the night. Charlotte stares in wonder as Emily enters and then the Baileys, each one of them welcomed in their turn. As the procession of people with candles enter 320 Sycamore, the light that filled the street begins to fill all the visible windows on the 1st floor of the house. A spark of kindness, a flicker of compassion and the warmth of the Granville home was once again ignited. For a while, she was able to keep the sadness at bay by focusing her attentions on young Steven. But as she wrestled with her despair, Charlotte found her calling. When she thought about Nathan, instead of focusing on her loss, she would remember her own words, 'What reason were we given this gift of one more good day, if not for the promise of one more good deed?'\" Charlotte had been the beneficiary of community support in a time of crisis. She was also acutely aware that not everyone in Bedford Falls had access to similar resources. Charlotte would fret, \"What we lack is a center of good will. A place for those in need of a good deed.\" Soon, creating a solution became a passion, and 320 Sycamore became the headquarters for a new venture; a service organization that provided for the less fortunate. Charlotte aptly named this organization \"The Welcome Hearth\". It has been said that, 'The greatest predators in nature are those with the most patience'. That adage proved appropriate one morning soon after Charlotte had launched her new initiative. As Charlotte kneels on the lawn outside 320 Sycamore, teaching Steven and several other neighborhood children how to plant and water perennials, a voice from the sidewalk catches her off guard, \"Good morning, Charlotte.\" She turns to see Henry Potter and Jenkins, his assistant. She offers a cheerful response, \"Good morning, Mr. Potter.\" \"Charlotte, I'm here to offer my condolences. Your husband was a credit to this town. He was a man of character and a pioneer. His presence will be missed.\" \"Thank you for honoring his memory.\" \"Yes. It is only right to honor a fallen brother-in-arms. We were part of a select fraternity, of sorts. As entrepreneurs, he and I financed many of the projects that have shaped this town.\" Charlotte draws a breath, as if to reply, but holds her words, unlike Henry, who dispenses his opinions as if he were dispensing $100 bills, \"And as a fellow businessman, I felt compelled to reach out to you, his wife, and offer myself as a resource.\" Charlotte arches her eyebrows and bites her lip as Henry shamelessly opines, \"No doubt you've already felt the burden of managing the affairs of the multiple businesses and properties Nathan left to you. And, while it is true that women have many redeeming qualities, wading into the murky waters of profit and loss is not one of them. Being a captain of industry can be a dirty business and one not sustainable by the fairer gender. No, navigating the complex morass of management is a thankless task best left to men. Charlotte can no longer contain her ire, \"To which group of men do you refer? Or maybe this is about one man, specifically? A man, such as yourself, who would gather …or more appropriately, seize…\" Henry correct her choice of words, \"Relieve you of the unnecessary burden placed on you, your family, and your latest venture,\" Henry gestures at the large, professionally painted sign that hangs from the porch ceiling. Charlotte smiles wryly and stands to respond to Potter, \"Your offer leaves me truly speechless.\" Henry misunderstands, taking her words as a complement, \"And you needn't worry about your lack of financial understanding either. I'll just have my lawyers draw up a contract for a sum that will be amenable to all.\" \"Mr. Potter, I am not offended that you have approached me to acquire some of Nathan's holdings. In fact, you have waited longer than I suspected you would. And, for that, I give you credit.\" Potter grins and nods, assuming all is going as he imagined it would. Despite her singular revulsion for this man and his dishonorable nature, Charlotte still seeks the words that are polite but direct in their intent, \"These properties, I assume are very important to you.\" \"You can assume that, yes.\" \"And a busy and important person such as you should, of course, never be inconvenienced by having to wait for anything that you desire.\" \"That is not something I would...\" \"Well, I am dreadful sorry to inform you that if you wish to own anything that was the property of Nathan Granville, you will have to wait.\" \"Wait? How long?\" \"At least until I'm dead and buried.\" Potter bristles. \"At which time, Steven will be in control of said businesses. But maybe you're willing to wait him out, also?\" Potter fumes, \"Ma'am, I have appeared here in good faith to help you. And you choose to mock me. Very well. This window of opportunity has closed! Jenkins!\" With a word, Potter's assistant is wheeling him away from Charlotte and back towards his carriage.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18: Peter Bailey enters the Larkin Soap store. He passes Sebastian who is behind the counter. \"Morning, Sebastian!\" Sebastian is focused on reviewing his inventory list. Without looking up, he points at the counter with his pencil, \"Your mail.\" Peter scoops up the mail, as he has done countless times before, and exits the scene. Several beats later, Peter returns in a panic. \"Sebastian?\" Peter says warily. Sebastian looks up from his paperwork, \"Yes?\" Peter is wide-eyed as he asks, \"What happened to the Building and Loan?\" \"Building and Loan?\" Peter points toward the back room, \"Yes, the B... Look! All the furniture is gone!\" Sebastian smiles, \"Oh, the furniture! You don't need to worry about the furniture.\" \"Well, why not?\" \"Because the men just finished loading it on the truck parked outside.\" \"Loading?...\" Peter scrambles to the door and he yells over the rumble of the truck engine, \"Wait! That's...!\" A large unmarked moving van that was parked outside of Larkin Soap begins to pull away from the store. Peter begins to chase the truck on foot, but opts to run over to Officer Jim Edmunds, who stands nearby, tying his shoe on the bumper of his patrol car. \"Jim! The truck...That truck!\" Jim tries to calm the panicked Bailey, \"Whoa! Slow down there Pete!\" \"That truck stole all of the Building and Loan's furniture!\" \"A robbery? In broad daylight? That's pretty bold. Let's go after 'em!\" Peter and Jim get in to the officer's patrol car. Jim turns on the siren and begins his pursuit. Jim asks Peter, \"You say he's got your furniture.\" Peter nods, \"That's right!\" \"This is the cheap furniture you're always complaining about.\" Peter responds, a bit annoyed with the question, \"What's your point?\" \"Why are you so concerned about a hunk of junk?\" \"Because it's my hunk of junk!\" Jim's car catches up to the slower moving truck. It pulls over and parks in front of Anderson's store. The driver and the passenger both exit the vehicle wearing mover's coveralls. The driver exits the vehicle, and cheerfully greets the policeman, \"Hello Jim!\" Jim smiles and responds to the driver and the passenger, \"Hi Jake! Waddya say, Marty?\" Marty waves and opens the back of the truck. Peter shakes his head in disbelief, \"Jim! That furniture belongs to the Building and Loan!\" Jim looks up to Dr. Campbell who has been surveying the scene from the second floor window above Anderson's. \"Say Doc, Peter says all this second-hand stuff belongs to the Building and Loan.\" Campbell, a bit dejectedly, confirms Jim's comment, \"I'm afraid he's right.\" Bill pokes his head out the other window, \"And if you can spare a few minutes between writing summons, you can help bring up a desk or two! Hello Peter Pan! Actually, you look more like one of the Lost Boys! Well, are you coming up or shall I tell the movers you prefer to work in the stairwell?\" Peter looks up at the pair with his mouth agape, then sputters, \"Doc...Bill. What in blazes is going on?\" Jim stares impatiently at Peter while gesturing with his hand that he should walk up the stairs. Peter takes the hint and begins the climb. As Peter enters the second floor, he is greeted by a cheering group of well-wishers including Bill, Dr. Campbell, Charlotte Granville and Margaret Bailey who is holding an infant. Thomas is the first to shake the hand of the bewildered Bailey, \"Welcome to your new office! Impressive, no? Had to take a loan to cover the cost. But, August and I agree, we are a good credit risk!\" Billy closes in to throw an arm over his brother's shoulder. \"Four short years, Pete! No more back rooms for us!\" The movers enter pushing Peter further into the office space. Jim follows the movers. And after Jim comes Sebastian, who enters with an important question, \"Hey Jim! Have you seen any of that missing furniture around here?\" Everyone laughs. Peter grins and shakes his head. Minutes later, a party has erupted in the office space. Dignitaries are also present, including the Mayor and several of the town councilmen. Pascal the barber has arrived with a stranger. He sidles up to Bill, who cradles an infant in his arm. \"Hey, Bill! I heard you-a moving in to my part of town. \"Our part of town!\" corrects the stranger. \"Our part of town,\" repeats Pascal. This is our new pharma-pharna...how you say it?\" The stranger smiles and finishes the introduction, \"Hi Bill, I'm John Gower. Pharmacist, and neighbor. My drug store will be right next door!\" Bill shifts the infant to his left arm so that he can shake John's hand \"Well, welcome to you, too. Say 'hello' to my nephew George.\" John bends slightly toward the bundle in Bill's arm. \"Hello George, pleased to meet you.\" John straightens and says to Bill, \"I have son, he's in high school now.\" Bill replies, \"I hope to meet him, soon. We have some refreshments on the table, please help yourselves and...\" Thomas whistles to quiet the now boisterous crowd, \"Attention, everyone's attention please! I'd like to welcome everyone to the new location of the Building and Loan!\" The crowd cheers. \"We've been a business now for four years. But, like so many other businesses in this town, the Building and Loan would still only be a thought if it were not for the support of Nathan Granville, God rest his soul\" The cry, \"Here, here!\" goes up from the crowd. \"His wife, Charlotte, is with us today. Charlotte, please join me up here.\" As the cheers from the crowd subsided, Thomas continued, \"In honor of Nathan's memory, Councilman Kraft and I had decided to rename this the Granville Building and Loan.\" Crowd cheers again. But, Thomas signals to hold the applause. \"Charlotte, once she learned of our intent, persuaded us otherwise.\" The crowd murmurs as Charlotte speaks, \"The honor should go to the living, and especially those who have done so much to make this a reliable and well-respected institution. For this reason, the Bedford Falls Building and Loan will now be known as the Bailey Building and Loan!\" The crowd erupts. Peter and Billy shake hands with Campbell and hug Charlotte. Peter asks Thomas, \"Where is August, I thought he was the speech master?\" Thomas responds, \"He asked me to apologize. He had a very important meeting that he had to attend.\" August was disappointed about being summoned by Henry just before the festivities began, yet he understood that Potter's political help would have to be repaid with responsiveness. As August approaches Potter's office he hears Henry grousing to someone on the phone, \"No, she did not accept my offer. Well, don't you worry about that. I'm as resolved as ever.\" August knocks on the office door. Potter barks, \"Come!\" August pokes his head in. Potter waves him in as he finishes his call, \"Yes, I'll expect to have better news soon.\" Potter hangs up the phone as August takes a seat. Henry leans forward, resting his arms on his desk while clasping his hands, \"August, I took on the task of being your campaign manager because I believe you to be a man of vision.\" \"Nice of you to say.\" \"And as a man of vision, I'm sure you would act to correct any laws that were detrimental to the citizenry of Bedford Falls. \"As would any councilman.\" \"Councilman. That's right. Well, Mr. Councilman, I suggest to you that as we sit here a serious problem is brewing.\" Kraft leans forward slightly, \"How serious?! \"Serious enough to require your immediate attention. I have here in my hand a document that lists all of the tracts of land in the area that are deeded, but have not filed for development.\" Kraft looks at Potter quizzically. \"Hang it all, man! This town is growing daily, steadily. Immigrants. Farmers. All looking to share the benefits of our abundant little town. As long as these landowners can continue to hold these properties hostage, the growth potential of Bedford Falls will remain stunted.\" \"I had no idea'\" \"Most people don't. I consider it one of the great tragedies of our time. One can only lament at the lost opportunity from these lands. So much potential, just wasting away.\" \"And what can I do about that?\" \"You can use your powers of persuasion. Work with the city council to have these properties rezoned. And by local law, an owner of a property that has been reclassified must refile for ownership. An amended version of the law would require that the owner agrees to develop the property in the short term.\" August responds, \"Very well. I can draft a brief for the town council to approve. May I have the listings of the properties involved to include with the brief?\" August reaches for the document in Henry's hand, but Henry recoils, \"The list is not yet complete. You go ahead and draft the brief directing them to review an attached list, which I will provide to you just before the next meeting of the council.\"[Chapter 19] Chapter 19: The chambers of the city council is filled to near capacity. The Bedford Falls Youth Choir, which includes Steven Granville, is opening the proceedings with a selection of favorites. As the choir finishes their musical offering, the crowd applauds them heartily. As the conductor leads the children offstage, the council president rises and thanks the parents, the conductor and the children for their performance. In the back of the room, the choir is dispersing. The children all begin looking for their parents. Steven runs to where Charlotte stands. She smiles and hugs him, \"I'm proud of you! You did very well!\" The council president calls the meeting to order, \"\"Welcome citizens of Bedford Falls. The biweekly meeting of the City Council is in session. This evening's agenda is quite full, so I move that we waive the reading of last session's minutes.\" \"I second the motion!\" August Kraft calls out. As a junior member of the council, he is seated at a far end of the council table. The council president continues, \"Let's take up new business...first on the agenda is a zoning proposal sponsored by Mr. Kraft. August, the floor is yours.\" August rises and addresses the chamber, \"Thank you, Mr. President. The fact that Bedford Falls has so much to offer is evidenced by the number of new citizens who move to this town each year. The town is steadily growing in population. August notices Henry Potter in the audience. Potter give August an approving nod. August continues introducing his proposal, \"But I suggest that we are being prevented from adding facilities to meet the needs of our new neighbors. There are many vacant tracts of land in Bedford Falls that could accommodate schools, shopping centers, and playgrounds for the children. The owners of these tracts have a civic responsibility to put their lands to use in the short term, or should sell those lands to others who are eager to make use of them. Crowd murmurs. \"I understand that copies of the list of properties in question have been distributed. \" The crowd begins to review the list. A person standing next to Charlotte asks for a copy of the list. A small stack of papers sit on the windowsill behind Charlotte. She hands one to her neighbor, and procures one for herself. August continues, \"Now, what this proposal seeks to do is ensure that the owners of these properties have a plan to make use of their land-sometime in our lifetimes. Ripple of laughter from the crowd. Potter, too, smiles. His plan is unfolding. The long sought-after Granville properties were just a council vote away from becoming available. August plays to the crowd, \"I don't believe that is too much to ask.\" The council president bangs his gavel to call for order, \"Very well, Zoning Proposal 15-A has been introduced. We'll open the floor for comments. Council members?\" A moment of silence passes before the council president says, \"Very well, do we have any comments or questions from the citizens. No one offers comments, although Charlotte can be seen in the rear of the hall. She was leaning against the wall, but she suddenly stand up straight. The Council President raises his gavel, \"Very well, the Council will now vo...\" Just before the President's gavel hits the table, Charlotte shouts, \"Mr. President!\" \"Yes...Mrs. Granville?!\" \"This proposal...What is the pretense for its creation?\" \"Councilman Kraft has just outlined the purpose of the plan.\" Charlotte turns her, now angry, gaze toward August, \"Has he? That's very noble of him since not one of these parcels are in his possession.\" August looks at Charlotte, trying to grasp her intention. Charlotte holds up the document and asks, \"Has our esteemed Councilman seen who does own a majority of these properties?\" Searching the leaves of paper for the addendum, pauses to take in the list of properties and goes pale. He stares at Charlotte, and shakes his head in disbelief. \"I must ask that you withdraw this proposal!\" \"On what grounds? By procedure, once a proposal is introduced, it must be voted upon. However, you are welcome to share with us your reasons for being against the rezoning measure.\" Charlotte moves forward toward the middle of the room. \"Gentlemen, proposals such as this may seem to have the majority in mind. However, I caution you. This proposal is not so much a measure designed to help all citizens of Bedford Falls. Its purpose is to help one citizen of Bedford Falls.\" Charlotte's gaze finds Potter seated in the back row. Henry fidgets nervously. \"This is no broad proposal with a noble purpose. This is a targeted list. And the properties bequeathed to me by my late husband are the targets.\" Charlotte pauses to gaze at the faces in the room, then turn her gaze to the town councilmembers. \"Vote as you will, I understand the world of business is about progress and profits not patience and people. However, if you vote on this measure knowing that it unfairly benefits one man, alone, then you might as well rename this town Potter's Gulch and make it a monarchy.\" Charlotte leaves the council room, staring down Potter as she exits. The council members huddle together to discuss their options. After a moment, they return to their seats. The president bangs the gavel, \"Order please. Let's have some order.\" The crowd settles down to hear the decision. The president continues, \"The city council can see a number of benefits to the proposed plan.\" Potter smiles and nods. \"However, we have decided that this plan should be tabled until such time that a more exhaustive study of its potentials and pitfalls can be conducted.\" Potter grimaces as President bangs gavel to close proceedings. Kraft appears relieved that the proposal failed. August managed to survive the rezoning debacle. In the immediate aftermath, Charlotte and August realized that they had a common cause for concern in the person of Henry Potter. Charlotte knew that she would need allies to keep Henry at bay. And she thought well enough of August to make him executor of the Granville trust. The dynamics of this arrangement was intriguing: Charlotte had added an additional legal layer between Potter and any claim he might make on Granville properties, but did so knowing that this layer has a close business relationship with Potter. It would not be a stretch to suggest that Charlotte might be making a gross miscalculation. But time proved her trust to be correctly placed. Three years later August became council president. Four years after that, he was elected mayor of Bedford Falls. All the while, he remained on guard against any attempts by Potter to usurp Granville land. Henry's land grab of 1909 failed. But he never gave up on his quest. He waited patiently for his opportunity. And the opportunity presented itself in August of 1917, as the country readied to join World War I.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20: (June 1918) It is a quiet summer morning in Gower's drug store. A prominent poster in the store promotes \"The Selective Service Act\", the military enrollment program. Another poster displays an image of an American flag unfurling in the breeze with the words \"ENLIST TODAY!\" emblazoned across the bottom. A pair of uniformed men walk by the store toting duffle bags over their shoulders. Mr. Gower is behind the counter storing supplies, as Henry and his assistant enter, \"Hello Mr. Jenkins, I see you brought Mr. Potter with you today.\" Potter snaps, \"I'll thank you to get my medications quickly. I want to spend as little time in this kid trap as possible.\" Gower shakes his head and leaves to get the meds. Henry mumbles to himself, \"What is he a druggist or a comedian?\" Then he motions to Jenkins, \"Wait outside.\" As Jenkins exits, the sound of two discordant voices passing the drugstore has drawn Potter's attention. The voices belong to the two remaining Granvilles. Steven is a tall, opinionated 16 years old. The two have just passed the entrance of Gower's store and are crossing the street. Bill Bailey has been surveying the landscape from the second story window of the Building and Loan, which is above Anderson's. Charlotte says to Steven in a stern tone, \"This is not up for discussion.\" Steven responds with spite, \"Of course it's not. Because it gets in the way of something that's dads. Or it's not convenient for a project of yours. I'm last on the list of considerations.\" Charlotte counters, \"That's unfair and immature.\" Charlotte is poised to enter Anderson's, but Steven has stopped outside the store. \"This isn't about my maturity. It's about your control over me. Well, use it while you can, you won't have control of my life forever.\" Steven runs back across the street toward Gower's Charlotte says, under her breath, \"And that's what frightens me most.\" Bill has been watching the exchange, \"Quite a temper on the young Granville!\" Charlotte says, \"Growing pains! The Bakers are taking a train to Buffalo next week and invited Steven. But I need him with me next week to help with the food distribution for the elderly.\" Bill responds, rubbing his backside, \"All I know is, if I talked to my folks that way, I'd have growing pains for a week! Do you want me to have a talk with him?\" \"Thank you, Bill. No.\" Charlotte casts a worried eye across the street, then enters Anderson's store. Steven enters the pharmacy and sits at a stool at the far end of the counter, near the door. Mr. Gower tosses a towel over his shoulder, \"Hello Steven, what can I get you?\" \"Soda, please.\" As he reaches behind the counter for a soda glass, Mr. Gower's face takes on a concerned look, \"You ok?\" \"She rules my life. I always have to do what she wants me to do.\" Henry remains focused on his newspaper, but cannot miss the opportunity to opine, \"Well, I'm sure you'll get over it one your inheritance is due.\" \"That won't be soon enough!\" Potter mumbles, \"Feeling confined, eh? Try living in a wheelchair!\" The store owner pours a soda for Steven. Potter glances at this paper to pass the time. Potter notices the article on the front page, \"Recruitment Age to Be Lowered to 18\". Potter's eyes get all squinty. He glances at Steven, then back at the paper. Potter barks at Gower, \"How long am I going to have to wait for my prescriptions?\" Mr. Gower sets soda in front of Steven and responds, \"OK Mr. Potter, I'll get them right now.\" As the druggist disappears into the back room of the pharmacy, Henry starts a conversation with the young Grandville, \"I can understand your plight. At your age I, too, was eager for independence, to make my own decisions.\" Steven gives Potter a dismissive look. \"Of course, now I can travel at will, but when I was a young man, I was longing to see the world! My parents, who were rather shortsighted, believed that everything worth seeing or doing could be seen or done at home. And this was my plight. I was full of wanderlust but to disagree with my parents meant disrespecting them.\" Steven responds with half-hearted interest, \"What did you do?\" Mr. Gower returns with the mogul's meds, \"I believe these are yours. The total is four-fifty.\" Henry responds, \"Not so fast! This is one month's supply. I'll be traveling soon and will need the second months' worth as well.\" \"Well, I'll need at least a few minutes to increase the order.\" \"Sure, sure. Take as much time as you need!\" Potter's sudden change of mood causes Gower to exit shaking his head. Potter turns back to face Steven and continues where he left off, \"What did I do? I made a decision to act! I was a man, and as such became responsible for myself. I enlisted with the United States Calvary!\" Steven looks at Potter in disbelief. \"Oh, yes, yes. I was quite good with a horse in my youth. That is, until the horse I was riding got spooked and threw me on my back, putting me in this chair.\" \"I've heard that you can't walk because you were sick as a boy...\" \"Lies!\" Henry said with venom, \"If anyone insinuates that my situation is the result of some physical infirmity, they are misinformed!\" Henry's tone calms considerably as he brings the subject back to his youthful adventures, \"So there I was, a young buck, helping to open the Wild West, and traveling to rustic, often uncharted territories.\" \"And what did your parents think about your enlistment? \" \"That's the best part. They were never prouder of me. I still remember my father telling me how mature he thought I was.\" \"Well, it's different these days.\" \"Yes. You are right. Instead of living for weeks in uncivilized areas, today's soldier immediately gets to tour France and England.\" \"That's not what I mean...\" \"I'm just saying what I would do if I were a young man now. And, it really doesn't matter since you are under the age for enlistment.\" Steven opens his mouth to defend his age as Mr. Gower returns with the additional medication. The store owner reaches over the counter and accepts Henry's cash in exchange for the glass jar. Henry punctuates the conversation with a crafty conjunction, \"But, come to think of it, so was I.\" Mr. Gower moves to the cash register to make change. Potter takes the change from the druggist and concludes his conversation, \"Anyway, why rush it. We may both know the feeling of being confined, you and I. But you'll have your freedom...in a year or so.\" Henry motions to his assistant, who wheels Henry outside and to his vehicle. Mr. Gower arranges the contents of the cash register while speaking to Steven, \"Don't pay any attention to Henry...\" Mr. Gower turns to face Steven, who is no longer on his stool, but instead, can be seen through the drug store window, running down the street. Charlotte leads a reading group that is assembled in the front room of 320 Sycamore. A harrowing scream echoes through the house. Charlotte runs into the foyer. Celia flies by her in a state of great distress. Charlotte looks back at the door, which is open. Steven stands smiling in the doorway in full Navy uniform. \"Hello, mother!\" The sight of her son in uniform has caused her to wobble slightly and then faint.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21: (June 15 1918) It is evening in Bedford Falls. All the stores along Genesee Street are dark, except for the B&L.; Bill, Peter, and Thomas are huddled at the customer counter. As they talk, they wear looks of concern on their faces. At the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs, all three men walk towards the front door in a state of anticipation. Kraft enters, removing his coat. Thomas asks, \"Well Hab, what's the verdict?\" August shakes his head, \"It's out of our hands.\" Bill walks away, and throws his hands down with disgust. Peter asks, \"What happened? \" August replies, \"I spoke with Colonel Bartus. He's the head of recruiting. He said it would take days to dig up Steven's paperwork!\" Bill fumes, \"A lot of good that would do us! Steven leaves for recruit training at Fort Mills tomorrow morning! What was he thinking? He knows his mother is depending on his help!\" Peter provides his perspective, \"To be fair, there is a war on. The patriotic call to duty might be a reason for his decision.\" Bill rejects the assumption, \"He's a hot-headed kid who made a rash decision to spite his mom! August, couldn't you have talked him out of it?\" \"By the time I arrived, he had already departed to muster with the rest of his unit.\" Thomas adds, \"But, legally, he is underage.\" August confirms, \"True. There were hundreds of brave men eager to sign up and ship out at the recruiting station. Many seemed very young. When I returned to Charlotte, I told her it's likely someone had to sign his authorization papers, certifying his age. \"Who signed?\" Bill demanded as he takes a seat near August. \"Not Charlotte,\" August responded. \"Once she confirmed, I was prepared to go back to the recruiting station. I told Charlotte I would use my clout to get his recruitment rescinded.\" Bill jumps up, \"Now you're talking common sense!\" \"She forbid me to do it.\" Thomas echoes, \"She forbid...?\" Peter asks, \"Why would she...?\" The mayor motions for quiet so that he can explain, \"She's devastated, of course. She told me that she sat down with him. Reasoned with him. Offered him compromises that provided him greater personal liberties if he would change his mind. As Charlotte listened to his response, she said, she wasn't sure if this was a different person in front of her, or maybe she was relly listening to him for the first time. In either case, she was surprised by Steven's response. It was measured and logical... almost mature. Bill demands to know, \"What could he say that would make any difference?\" August paused and tilted his head, \"He promised her that he was not running away from her and Bedford Falls. Instead, he said he was running towards an opportunity to make the town and her proud of him.\" The room goes silent for a moment. \"Also, Charlotte asked me to convey her gratitude for all of the concern. She asks us to pray and send good wishes for Steven's safe and speedy return.\" In the aftershock of yet another seismic shift in Charlotte's life, she refused to let her fears own her. In fact, she almost immediately put them to work for her. On the day the mayor pays a visit to The Welcome Hearth, he finds it bustling with activity. Mr. Gower is delivering another large container of dry goods, Sabastian is directing traffic and supply delivery, May and Emily are packaging, wrapping and addressing parcels. And Mrs. Granville is speaking with the printer, \"These are perfect Mr. Weiss. Please post them where ever you can throughout town.\" \"Good morning Charlotte. It looks like the 'Care Package Brigade' is a success! The overseas troops will really appreciate these!\" \"It is uplifting to see so many citizens supporting the war effort. And, thank you for covering the cost of the promotional leaflets and postage!\" \"Don't mention it. Have you heard from Steven?\" \"Yes, they are shipping out to France tomorrow.\" \"We all pray for the safe return of him and his comrades in the nation's service.\" \"Thank you. What brings you here today?\" \"Official business. Do you have a moment?\" \"Just a moment. Let's talk in the study.\" Charlotte sighs, \"Official business? This sounds important! It is a very unfortunate situation. And, I'm ashamed to say yet another situation that requires a Granville Good Deed. It appears that groundwater has been seeping under the cemetery grounds for some time. Oh dear! We've had professional surveyors and engineers inspect. They all agree that nothing could be done without unearthing the caskets and remains of the dead. How ghastly! I'm certain the city would pay for the exhumation and the transportation of the departed. Unfortunately, there are few remaining sizeable plots of land within the city limits that met the requirements for interment. As it happens, one of those options is a property in the Granville Trust. If I can impose upon you to allow the city to purchase this land from you, I will present the idea to the city council. \"Of course. You are executor, and I am certain you will arrange a fair deal on my behalf.\" To residents of Bedford Falls, the name Charlotte Granville is synonymous with 'good deeds' and 'giving'. Then came the day that something of hers was taken that could never be replaced. Summer was coming to a close and the Care Package Brigade was hard at work at the Welcome Hearth. Charlotte responded to a knock on the door. She expected to see her neighbor. As she answered the door, she chided, \"Mrs. Cagle! You know you don't have to knock...\" Charlotte first noticed the bicycle that leaned against her fence. It was a familiar bike, painted a bright red. Owned by Jules Ahern, the town postmaster, the bike was often piloted by uniformed young men of the town who Jules employed to deliver telegrams. Many of those young men now wore a different uniform and were far from home. These days Jules delivered the telegrams, and it was Jules who stood before Charlotte. His face was careworn and his eyes were down cast. Jules had no heart to look a spouse or a parent in the eye as he spoke the dreaded words, words that he had already spoken too many times before, \"Telegram from the War Department.\" From that moment forward Charlotte and reality parted company. August cancels a budget meeting and rushes to 320 Sycamore. Inside, he finds Emily, Celia and May. All of them displaying wide-eyed confusion. Margaret Bailey arrives just after August. They both enter the study and find Charlotte sitting by the fireplace in a chair next to a tall stack of books. Gone is the composed and logical Mrs. Granville. In her place is the physical embodiment of rage and fury. She leafs through each book in turn, tearing out pages, seemingly at random and tosses them into the fire. The unhinged editor acknowledges her new visitor by rending another leaf and chuckling derisively, \"Have no fear, Mrs. Bailey, I am diligent as ever! I've found over eighty defective verses so far. Insensitive application of the third-person voice and worse - overuse of conjunctions!\" Charlotte tears another page. \"And, and, and, and, and, and, and! As if everything goes on forever. Say your peace, crown it with a proper period and be done with it.\" Charlotte pauses and squints at one of the pages of a book. \"And it matters not how cleverly you try to conceal them, Mr. Masters, \"nevertheless\" is, nevertheless, a conjunction.\" Charlotte pauses momentarily, looks straight at August and violently dislodges another page. She then announces, \"I will not rest until I've purged the lot of them!\" May furrows her brow and exits the room. August, Emily and Margaret follow. Mrs. Campbell informs the group, \"Tom is trying to find someone qualified to help her. In the meantime, I'm willing to stay here and keep a watchful eye on her.\" \"Me too,\" Margaret offers. Emily agrees, \"We can work in shifts.\" The ladies begin organizing for their stayover. Kraft visits the Genesee County Sanatorium. May Campbell is there, keeping an eye on her. August inquires, \"Any improvement?\" \"She won't eat. Won't recognize that anyone else is in the room with her. Thomas is consulting with the best doctors in the county. They all agree, her health deteriorates daily. Yet that photo-the one taken at Peter's wedding. She clings to it like a life preserver.\" Into the gloom walks a nurse. May grabs the young lady's arm and gently pulls her near, \"And this young lady has been a blessing!\" The nurse smiles in response. \"She has been doing everything possible for Charlotte's comfort.\" August gives the nurse a respectful nod as she exits the room. The he turns toward the bed-ridden Granville, \"Our heroic Charlotte! Your patronage is important, but you cannot know how much the town is diminished by the absence of your spirit!\" May's voice wavers, \"So true. Three of us have tried to keep up her routine of activities at The Welcome Hearth with little success.\" August continues the litany of unhappy events resulting from Charlotte's absence, \"Disarray is overtaking the factory. Other Granville businesses are losing their focus, and I do not want to contemplate the loss of her support and the negative impact that will have on the Building and Loan!\" May tears up as she stares at Charlotte's gaunt face, \"And I do not want to lose my friend.\" August frowns and nods. He rises and puts a hand on May's shoulder, \"Emily will be along shortly.\" August shuffles slowly out of the room.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22: (September 1918) On the long walk home, August shuffles down Sycamore Street. He pauses in front of The Welcome Hearth and puts both his hands on the weatherworn white gate. Overcome by emotion, his head droops and his shoulders begin to heave as he weeps uncontrollably. As August tries to gather himself, he becomes aware of children's voices nearby. Six boys run past, yelling \"Quick! Run! Mary's coming! Hee Haw!\" A young girl, about seven years old, runs after them yelling \"Marty! Marty! Mama wants you!\" She pauses near August, folds her arms to display her unhappiness at being ignored and huffs, \"Boys!\" Mary turns to face the stranger at the fence, \"Hi!\" August dabs his face with a handkerchief and replies, \"Hello.\" Mary ask a simple, childlike but obvious question, \"Are you sad?\" August, a little embarrassed, responds, \"Yes.\" Mary's innocent inquiry continues, \"Why?\" \"I miss my friend. This is her house.\" Mary looks up toward the second story, squints and smiles, \"I like this house. Is she a pirate, too?\" August is confused by the question, \"Pirate?\" Mary closes one eye and points to it. August touches his eye patch and smiles, \"Oh! No. She's no pirate. Most people like her.\" \"Maybe she'll come back soon?\" August frowns, \"That would be my most sincere wish. Unfortunately, I'm out of hope.\" \"Would it help if I hope for you?\" August is touched by the naive, but well-meaning gesture. He smiles and says, \"Thank you, young lady. It couldn't hurt.\" Mary offers up an agreement. \"OK. I'll hope for you, and you can hope for me.\" \"And what is it that you hope for?\" Mary leans in to tell August a secret. \"There's a boy I really like. My brother's friend, George Bailey. I hope he likes me as much as I like him.\" August smiles and nods. Mary looks August squarely in the eye and asks, \"Deal?\" \"Depends. Can you trust a pirate?\" Mary pauses before responding, \"I think so.\" \"Alright. Mary, is it? It's a deal!\" Mary then provides August with the only certified process for 'Mutual and Concurrent Granting of Good Wishes', \"OK. Touch thumbs. Close your eyes. One, two, three... I hope, I hope, I hope!\"[Chapter 23] Chapter 23: The winter of 1918 – 1919 was full of emotions. Tears of joy and of sorrow were shed in November as the war ended and the U.S.-led allies were victorious. Many wept for lost brothers, fathers, and sons. At the same time, many were elated that the next generation might be spared the horrors of armed conflict. Only a few weeks later, tragedy and relief were experienced from the same event. Peter's sons George and Harry nearly drowned in a pond when they fell through thin ice. Fortunately, they were with friends who were able to help pull them to safety. Emily rarely saw August during this time. If he wasn't tending to Granville affairs, he was organizing a hero's ceremony for the soldiers. When spring came, Mayor Kraft hosted a hero's parade and unveiled a grand memorial statue near the entrance of the city park. It was a touching tribute to the returning soldiers and the casualties of war. In a town like Bedford Falls, everyone was either related to, worked with or was a friend of at least one of the 27 names on the base of the statue. At about the same time, it became clear that Charlotte's physical health was becoming tenuous. Her will to live had been exhausted. Being Charlotte's executor, August huddled with the Baileys and the Campbells. He spoke with them regarding the delicate matter of handling the remaining Granville properties, and he received affirmation for his plan of action. Mayor Kraft is in his office at the county courthouse dictating letters to his secretary. He pauses as hears a familiar voice barking orders from the outer office, \"Through here, Jenkins. And with haste! As if your trousers were aflame!\" The mayor rises to greet Henry, \"You visiting me? It is a red letter day...\" \"Park the Welcome Wagon, Kraft! I've learned from my sources that you've sold the factory! To a second cousin of the Granville's no less!\" \"I have indeed.\" \"That wahoo has no idea how to run a business.\" \"That wahoo already has lured two major clients away from plants in Cleveland and Pittsburgh.\" \"And what are your plans for the other Granville assets?\" Kraft slide a piece of paper across the desk towards Potter, \"I'm glad you asked.\" \"What's this?\" \"It's a list of Granville's three most desirable remaining properties. Selling price is listed at the bottom.\" This was a seminal moment for the aging tycoon. A significant number of Granville properties would finally be in his possession. Henry did his best to hide his excitement, \"A tad overpriced. But I'll purchase all three.\" At that moment, Kraft slides a second piece of paper next to the first. \"And what's this?\" Henry asks. \"That is a list of three Granville owned businesses that are in need of an investor to replace the 40% share that Charlotte held in each.\" \"Grain silo, charity, building and loan...no one I know would put a dime into those woeful ventures. Especially the Building and Loan! I heard about your plans to throw good money into the earth, as it were. Buying up the marsh that was the cemetery. Bailey's Bog! There's an investment you'll never get a penny from. Mark my words!\" August remains motionless and silent with this gaze fixed on Henry. Potter says in disbelief, \"Are you suggesting that the Granville land is mine only if I support these near-bankrupt businesses? If this is your idea of negotiating, I'm not impressed.\" Potter turns his wheelchair away from Kraft and toward the door, \"Good day!\" Potter slows and stops as Kraft responds. \"Package deal, Henry. It may not be ideal for you, but it I assure you, you'll never get closer to possessing Granville land than right here...right now!\"[Chapter 24] Chapter 24: As the Bailey Building and Loan approaches two decades of operation, the brainchild of August Kraft and Thomas Campbell has earned the right to be called both 'useful' and 'lasting'. Thomas, as chairman of the Board, remains quite active. And while August's many responsibilities keeps him busy, when time allows, he stops by to get an update on business news, but also to satisfy his sentimental side. Peter Bailey is pacing in his office when he hears the front door open and close. He exits his office and into the common area. He greets the mayor with a handshake, \"Morning Mayor.\" \"And a good morning to you, Mr. Bailey. Is all well? You look a little worn down.\" \"Bad case of Potter-itis, I guess.\" \"Oh?...\" Peter shakes his head, \"He was in again today. Third time in two weeks. Demanding a dividend for his investment.\" Peter's tone becomes increasingly distressed. \"Five-thousand he wants, or he says he'll retract his total investment. He'd give gum on his shoe better treatment. Every time he rolls in here...\" Peter pauses, grimaces and balances himself on the counter. August, alarmed, leans close and grabs Peter by the arm, \"Peter. Peter? Just relax, now! Deep breaths!\" Peter straightens slightly and slowly begins to regain his composure. The mayor gives a concerned look to his old Building and Loan pal, \"Worry can kill a man, Peter. Don't make me regret the day we hired you.\" August had misjudged Henry. The mayor had figured that once Henry had acquired some of the long-sought after Granville properties, he would be less ornery. After all, he had managed to outlive his business rival. Would this not satisfy him? However, his victory had an unexpected consequence. Henry had now had a hole in his soul: the decades-old altar of deep resentment at which he constantly worshipped was suddenly was barren. Now in search of a suitable replacement target for his hate, Henry had the Bailey Building and Loan foisted upon him. The match was undeniable; burr, meet saddle. Unto Peter, Henry could transfer all of the negative energy he had so long reserved exclusively for Nathan Granville. And as often as humanly possible, he did. Meanwhile at the Sanitarium... Looking in through a window of the facility, a contingent of citizens, including Kraft stands near Charlotte's bedside. Kraft holds her hand, but Charlotte lies pale and motionless. Charlotte Granville's health declined. Her spirit left this earth in March of 1922. Same scene, people are gone, bed is empty and neatly made. Kraft and Emily accept the box of Charlotte's personal effects, including the wedding photo, from the dark haired, dark eyed nurse. He thanks her for taking such good care of his friend. He offers her an envelope to show his gratitude. The envelope contains his business card. If I can do anything to help you or yours, please don't hesitate to ask. Emily then asks her name. \"Lily\", she replies. In a sad coincidence, the first bodies laid to rest in the newly opened cemetery were those of Nathan, Steven and Charlotte Granville. They were given a grand mausoleum on a hill overlooking the entire grounds. The facility was named Granville Gardens in their honor, and the long drive that led to the memorial park was renamed Granville Green. August went about his duties, but there was little joy. The daily bickering and squabbling over petty differences made him angry. He began taking longer vacations and avoiding people. After spending an afternoon at the park, he returns home. He made his way around to the back porch and entered the kitchen. Emily's voice greeted him, \"August?\" \"Looks like rain. Where are you?\" \"I'm in here. I have a surprise for you!\" \"Surprise?\" August mumbles as he follows his wife's voice to the front room. Emily stands proudly beside the newest piece of furniture. \"Ta-da!\" August scowls, \"What is that?\" \"Your new easy chair. It's a recliner. Try it out!\" \"What drove you to buy that?\" \"Since you're ready to retire, I thought, 'Why not'?\" \"And who said I was retiring?\" Emily reaches buttons her overcoat and grabs an umbrella from the stand near the door, \"Well, all the time you've been spending at home-it just seems like the next logical step.\" \"I'm going into my office. And that thing can go right back where it came from!\" Emily, clearly disappointed replied, \"Well, I'll call the furniture store after I return from the bakery.\" Emily exits the house as Kraft enters his office and closes the door. \"Recliner...humph!\" Kraft sits down at his desk, shuffles some papers, and then tosses them aside. Slumping into his chair, he sighs heavily. Then he looks over to his right. A small burlap sack catches his eye. Separating the container from the other items piled on his desk, August brings it closer for inspection. It is tagged with a note, \"Personal Effects - C. Granville\". Kraft unties the sack, and extracts the bulkiest item; the photo frame containing the Granville family photo taken at Peter's wedding. August suddenly remembers a question he wanted to ask Emily. With the photo frame in his hand, he exists his office and calls out, \"Emily?\" August enters the living room and finds it vacant. He places one hand on the new chair and, acutely aware that Emily is not nearby, he cautiously admires the comfortable-looking lounge chair. He eyes the chair suspiciously and makes his way to the front of it. At first, he eases into it. Next, he positions himself fully on the seat cushion. Leaning back he slides his hands along both armrests. He notices some give in the backrest. Pushing against it a little harder, the chair glides into reclining position. \"Ohh!\" declares the impressed, and very leisurely legislator. A chuckle and a sigh follow. August's feet hit the floor before the second ring of the telephone. Afraid that he may miss the call, he lunged for the receiver, knocking it off the hook. A moment later, the device was in his grasp. \"Hello?\" \"Oh, hello Clifford!\" \"How's Albany? I...On vacation.\" \"Calm down. No. What message?\" \"Why would I be needed so urgently in Albany?\" \"Well sure, Eddie Clayton? He, uh. His congressional seat in my district.\" \"Not running? There's only eight months until the election. \"Who will be running in his place? They did? I am?\" The easy chair would have to wait. The nomination, the acceptance, the campaigning and the victory were all a blur. But through it all-each step of the way, August kept the Granville portrait with him. Their memory was never far from his thoughts and the stories of their good deeds often livened up an otherwise dull speech.[Chapter 25] Chapter 25: Many people associate the depression with the Market Crash of 1928. It was certainly a symptom. But loss of capital was just the first major domino to fall. Rising prices for goods. Fear of an uncertain future. Some people could no longer afford to spend, and those with money chose to spend much less. As a result, stores were shuttered, factories laid off, and productive plants like the Bedford Falls Tool and Machine works closed their doors. And the stress was more than just financial. Health also suffered. The stress of depression-era living was wearing on Peter Bailey, both personally and professionally. And it didn't help him to have Henry Potter constantly pestering him. The pressure eventually overtook Peter Bailey. August's and Thomas' \"Leapin' Looey\" had been the everyman champion they had been desperate to find. At his funeral, he was remembered fondly by all. Morbidly, August wondered if Peter hadn't been spared the indignities to come: the continued wearing away of common decency as a community of caring splintered quickly into a loose collection of self-absorbed individuals, each focused on their own survival. The crash had many people turning to government and asking \"What do we do now?\" In our nation's capital, Congressman Kraft huddled with his peers and asked the same question. To his dismay the reply was the question, \"Do we need to do anything at all?\" The fruit borne from the \"wait and see\" attitude of the congress was a steadily increasing flow of telegrams from voter's back home seeking relief. As the Western Union molehills grew into mountains, so too were legislator's fears growing that the time for \"wait and see\" had passed. For August, his sense of emergency peaks in February 1932. The daily requests from citizens in his district pleading for work or financial assistance kept the issue at the top of his agenda. His fellow representatives agree it is time to act, but are unable to find or access funding for needed projects. August, in particular, has reached a boiling point. Frustration results, as he cannot locate resources from national or local government. To his colleagues, to the press, to anyone who would listen he would cry out, \"Where are all our resources?!\" While August works to find an answer to the national crisis, an answer to a local, very personal matter materializes. His assistant walks into the office and waits for August to finish a phone call, \"That is true! Well, I very much look forward to the opportunity. I enjoy speaking with our youth! That is correct. I'll arrive at your school auditorium at about 2:30 pm. Thank you, Mrs. Clovis! Goodbye!\" August's assistant says, \"Packed schedule today. Any questions about the agenda?\" \"Thanks Chuck, no. I'll be on my way to the floor in ten minutes.\" Chuck turns to leave, then wheels back toward the legislator, \"Oh, I almost forgot. This just arrived.\" The assistant extracts a large, official-looking envelope from under his arm, hands it to August, and clarifies the source, \"It's from the War Department.\" As Chuck exits, August opens the envelope to find a single document. It is a form letter from the Records Division of the War Department. The letter informs August that the information he requested more than a year ago has been located, \"Our records show that Steven Granville enlisted on June 8, 1918. Proof of age documentation was not provided. However, a verification signature was provided by a Mr. Henry F. Potter.\" August's searing anger over Henry's treachery only compounded his frustration over stalled efforts to revitalize the nation's economy. And yet, August felt that somehow these two concerns were closely related. The congressman reasoned, \"Money invigorates economy. Henry has money. And, I have Henry in the palm of my hand.\" August's understands his scheme is illegal. The risk to a public figure and his family is magnified. Yet a solution, borne of desperation and revenge was at hand. At that moment of truth, August decides that the time of inaction has ended. Reaching for the phone, he dials a number he knows by heart and after a moment August speaks, \"Henry Potter, this is your conscience calling.\"[Chapter 26] Chapter 26: On the drive over, Henry reviews his speech. It is a bitter pill he is being forced to swallow. He realizes that being wealthy at a time when most others are experiencing poverty is one strike on him, right out of the gate. Add to that the mogul's well-deserved reputation as a curmudgeon, and you have two strikes. And if the citizens were shown proof that Henry lent a heavy hand to the downfall of the town's resident angels... As the strains of an approaching marching band are heard, Henry extracts a handkerchief and wipes the sweat from his brow. The wind had picked up a little as the marching band makes it way up Genesee. The unusual sound of brass and percussion had the desired effect. People who were outside stopped to watch and the people who were in the shops ventured outside. Hundreds of flyers made their way into the hands of curious citizens. And so, the good news began to spread. In the lot outside the factory, a makeshift dais has been erected. Kraft stands on the dais with the City Council and watches his plan come together. The marching band arrives, offering their best rendition of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\". They pass behind the stage and form up to the left. Several of the students position themselves stage right, waiving small US flags. The larger contingent of students remain near the entrance to the lot, handing out flags to the citizens who quickly begin to fill the lot space. Kraft holds the event flyer. He recalls the phrase he uttered to Thomas \"a deal with the devil himself, if it meant the resurrection of Bedford Falls!\" Kraft looks beyond the factory lot, out to the railroad tracks where the vehicle carrying Henry Potter has just moved into position. It is the last, and most critical, element of his plan. Henry wonders what happened to that Blue fellow. \"Meh!\" thinks Henry, \"Wasn't real. I made him up.\" The limousine slows and stops as it approaches the train tracks. Henry sighs, resigned to the fact that there is no turning back. All that lies between him and his financial commitment to this Granville money pit the wave of a green flag. He extracts a clipboard from a seat pocket and a pen from his coat pocket. He uncaps the pen and smooths the check that is attached to the clipboard. Henry licks his lips and shakes his head as moves the pen in place to sign the check and seal the deal. From August's perspective things are going well until he sees the man in the bowler standing next to Potter's car. At that moment, a familiar face, peering from underneath a bowler hat appears at Henry's window. \"Hey Henry!\" \"You!\" \"Me!\" \"What are you, Harry Houdini junior?\" \"Your request didn't leave me much time.\" \"So that's it then, you appear at the last possible moment to tell me you failed?\" August begins his prepared statement. \"Citizens of Bedford Falls, thank you for attending this short announcement. I am August Kraft, your congressional representative and I have some news to share, which I believe will be welcomed by everyone!\" \"Would you call this failure?\" Blue produces Kraft's signed copy of the contact. \"How did you get this?\" \"By doing my job. Some celebration. Too bad you will have to miss it.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I suggest you leave here immediately. See this man and offer him this amount of money. You can see that it is only a fraction of what this factory venture might cost you over time.\" The congressman raises the green flag. The band, on cue, plays a fanfare and the crowd murmurs in anticipation. August pauses, expecting the limo to roll forward. Instead, the limo remains still. \"How does that help me?\" \"Once you complete this transaction, you might consider using your new acquisition to apply the same pressure August is using on you.\" As Blue's words begin to sink in, Henry's face takes on a devious squint/grin. As Henry reviews the details of the document he queries Blue, \"Are these plans firm?\" Blue responds, \"I've arranged the meeting, he waits for you in his office.\" Henry then looks at Blue and offers the closest thing to praise that a miserly mogul can offer, \"This is satisfactory. Quite satisfactory.\" Assuming the driver missed the signal, August raises the green flag once again. The band, again, plays a fanfare. \"Then we can agree than my part of the contract has been fulfilled.\" \"Agreed.\" \"As for your part,\" Blue reached down to his belt and unhitched the metal chain, \"This is for you.\" Blue hands Henry the chain, which has the metal skull attached. \"What's this?\" \"It's my marker. Your I.O.U. to me. I'll be back to claim it soon enough.\" August's stomach begins to turn over as he watches the limo rolls forward on to the train tracks, execute a 180 degree turn and then speed away from the event. The rear window of the vehicle opens and the hand and arm of the limo's passenger appears, sending a signal of his own: A very small shower of confetti, the shredded check. The confetti is caught up in a breeze that quickly becomes a rush of a whistling wind. Within seconds the whistling becomes a howling as a mass of cloud appears to rush from one end of the track to the other. The howling mutates to an ear-splitting, plaintive screeching. This unearthly cacophony caused each citizen in the crowd to be immersed in fear and dread, as if they would be experiencing the end of the world that very day. Then, at the depth of their shared sadness, the deafening noise began to relent. Dim sunlight began to cut through the cloud of darkness. The Hell on Wheels, carrying Blue back to the land of the damned, receded from Bedford Falls. Kraft gathers himself as the spontaneous storm diminishes. As the haze begins to clear, Potter's limo disappears over a hill. Kraft realizes the betrayal. He is furious, but as he looks at the face of the citizens who have been led here under the pretense of receiving good news, August knows he must remain calm. \"Ladies and Gentlemen! It appears our special guest will not be able to appear today. However, I will not delay the good news any longer! Our Tool and Machine Works has a new owner and will be reopened in the near future!\" A roar went up from the crowd as the band played a celebratory tune and balloons were released from behind the dais. As August accepts the smiles and nods from the members of the city council, he knows that his announcement is a lie, but one that prevents a riot. The cheer of the crowd quickly turns to groans and muttering, and the blaring band suddenly ceases playing. The rain which has held off until now comes pouring down, causing everyone to scatter for cover.[Chapter 27] Chapter 27: Uncle Billy sits in the office of the Building and Loan, reading the newspaper and humming the wedding march. The phone rings. Bill cheerfully answers answers, \"Bailey Building and Loan. Well, hello George?! No, no, quiet as can be! Oh, I'll be fine. It's only a week...what can happen?\" The sound of a thunderclap is heard as Billy loses his smile and peers cautiously over his shoulder at the window. Rain pelts the window of Henry's office. The mogul is positioned near the fireplace, reviewing a legal document. Kraft bursts in, soaked from the storm, and growls, \"You owe me an explanation!\" Potter's words are dripping with sarcasm, \"Well, if it isn't the soon-to-be former congressman from New York!\" Potter glances at Jenkins and points to the spot in front of his desk, closer to Kraft. Jenkins wheels Potter to that spot, \"And let's be clear who's indebted here. It was my resources that were responsible for your start in politics.\" Potter's tone becomes angry, \"I lift you up from obscurity, giving you access to a better life than you could have ever made for yourself. And how do you repay me? With ingratitude! Backstabbing! You who are so fond of blackmail must grasp that it would only take a whisper of scandal to knock you off your high horse.\" Kraft seethes, \"Once I release the information about your improper enlistment assistance for Steven Granville. If you believe you are unpopular now...\" \"You seem to be unaware that the winds of fortune have recently shifted in my favor. Well let me enlighten you! I was recently made aware that our local bank was suffering from a slight solvency issue. Naturally, I offered my assistance. With the same resources that were promised for the factory, I've saved the bank from going belly-up.\" August stares at Henry. \"Do you know what I've discovered? I've discovered that bank owners are very busy people. In fact, I already have two items at the top of my priority list. First order of business will be to put a chokehold on your precious building and loan. With both the factory and the building and loan shuttered, the only memory that this town will have of any project from Kraft or Granville will be abject failure!\" Potter chuckles derisively, \"In a matter of hours, I will be, for all purposes the landlord of this community.\" \"And as for you my blackmailing friend, I can assure you that an audit of the bank records will find several accounts in your name that are swollen with deposits from potentially criminal sources. Add to the fact that you've conned people into believing that the factory will reopen. Who will listen to the complaints of a political criminal and a fraud?\" \"Maybe a political criminal with evidence. Or have you forgotten about our contract?\" \"Which contract is that August? Do you mean this one, with your official seal and signature on it? Is there a problem, August? Suddenly you don't look so well. Would you like me to call your friend, Dr. Campbell? Maybe it's just that the rain gave you a chill. Feel free to join me here close to the fire. I'll even add some fuel to make it warmer.\" Potter tosses the contract into the fire. August stares in shock as the blaze consumes the paper. August realizes his peril. The saturated legislator turns and stumbles toward the exit, while the vengeful mogul offers a final emotional kick, \"And now I banish you to the same flames of fate as that contract. So long, Convict Kraft! Out that door you go to your new future. A future of disgrace for you and yours. I'd be calling the authorities at this instant if I wasn't right in the middle of taking over the bank.\" Potter yells to Jenkins, \"Tell the bank manager I'm ready!\"[Chapter 28] Chapter 28: August Kraft sits in his vehicle which is parked in Henry's driveway. It is raining. His slouch and glassy stare give the impression of a man beaten. The driver's door is open and only one of August's legs are inside the car. He pulls himself entirely into the car and shuts the door. August begins to drive off, as a cat dashes in front of his car. He slams on the brakes and avoids the cat, but this sudden stop has caused his satchel to topple over, exposing the contents. August curses the cat and drives off. August drives through the center of town, in no hurry, with no direction. A pedestrian who dodges in front of his vehicle quickly returns him to the present. He notices many pedestrians, all in a hurry, all headed in the same direction: the bank. August pulls over to observe the commotion. As he waits, he begins to retrieve all of the items that were inside of his satchel, but are now on the passenger seat. The item that catches his immediate attention is a campaign leaflet with his name, face and slogan. With a wry smile, August crumples the paper and tosses it to the floor. August's attention is now drawn to the photo frame containing the image of the Granville family. A small scrap of paper protrudes from one corner of the frame. Upon inspection, August finds that scrap is a larger document lodged between the photo and the backing of the frame. Once the backing is removed, August gently removes and unfolds the paper. He is astonished to discover that he is holding the official deed to 320 Sycamore! A taxi decorated with soaking wet crepe paper catches Kraft's eye. The taxi slows and stops across the street from Kraft's car. The taxi driver and a male passenger in his mid-twenties step out from the taxi into the rain. They both pause to take in the chaos occurring outside the bank. The male passenger then makes his way to the small crowd gathered outside the Building and Loan. \"George Bailey! It looks like I missed the wedding.\" Kraft notices that the taxi hasn't moved. Furthermore, it contains one other passenger. The newly wed Mary Bailey sits in the back of the taxi watching her husband depart. August's demeanor changes. He sits up straight, looks forward as if a thought is formulating in his mind. He looks down at the deed in his hands and at the Granville's photo on the passenger seat. Kraft smiles and looks up, \"One more good deed, eh Charlotte?\" Inside of Ernie's cab sits Mary in back discussing with Ernie what should be done. The sound of knocking from the curbside window startles Mary. August's face appears at the window. Mary opens the door to let him in. Ernie barks, \"This taxi's out of service right now, Mac!\" Kraft nods, \"I need to have a word with the young lady. My name is August Kraft.\" She looks at Ernie who shrugs. August turns to Mary, \"Pardon the intrusion. It's Mrs. Bailey, now, am I correct?\" Mary holds Kraft's gaze and warily nods, yes. August smiles and points to his eye patch, \"And, do you recognize me?\" Mary, slightly embarrassed, again nods yes. \"May I share your cab for a moment?\" Mary slides across the seat toward the street side of the cab giving Kraft room. August enters and sits to Mary's left. Kraft removes his hat and acknowledges the moisture he has brought with him, \"Pardon the precipitation. If time allowed, I could explain all of the circumstances that have brought me here. My words may make little sense, now, but I need you to pay close attention to them. Mary, the situation is bad. And for you and George it may get worse.\" August positions himself to face Mary. \"I need to ask you a very important question. Mary, that day outside the Granville home. Our paths crossed. Do you remember our pact? Hoping for one and other?\" Mary nods yes. \"And do you still have hope?\" \"I do,\" Mary said. And a smile broke across her face, \"That'll be the second time today that I've said those words.\" \"Believe me when I say that both vows carry equal importance. But, Mary, I'm afraid that you may be staring up at a tidal wave of trouble.\" \"I'm afraid, too.\" \"The forces in play here seek personal gain, regardless of the human cost. I cannot stop the carnage, but I believe I can offer you a way of weathering the worst. What is important is that-whatever happens-you do not let it taint your view of the world, or your marriage. Can I count on you to remain strong?\" \"The day George asked me to be his wife, my greatest wish was granted.\" \"Remember that, always. And let them do their worst!\" Kraft reaches out and takes Mary's hand. In it he places the deed and the envelope. \"This is the deed to the house that once belonged to my friend; the house you admired so much. It was once a place of great hope and love. It, too, has seen better days. But, I believe you and George can bring it back to life. And this envelope contains finances for a campaign that will never happen. Now they are...an investment in the future of Bedford Falls. Ask no questions. Never mention our meeting to anyone. Now, go Mary. Go to your husband. He will need you now.\" Kraft exit the cab. Kraft straightens, smiles as he walks back to his car in the rain.[Chapter 29] Chapter 29: Henry Potter sits at his desk in his office. A nervous looking man stands in front of him. Henry signs a document. \"Now that that's taken care of, I think it's time to have a chat with our friend at the Building and Loan.\" Henry picks up the phone receiver, dials and then begins to speak with an unusually caring tone, \"George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors? Is that true? Oh, I'm very glad to hear that. George. Are you alright? Do you need and Police? Well, you know mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I have just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.\" Potter looks at the nervous man, who mops sweat from his brow with a handkerchief. Potter continues, \"They will close up for a week and then reopen. I may lose a fortune, but I am willing to guarantee your people too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.\" The voice on the other end of the call responds with venom, \"Aw, you never miss a trick, do you Potter? Well, you're gonna miss this one!\" Henry snaps back, \"If you close your doors before six p.m., you will never reopen!\" Potter jiggles the cradle of the phone, indignant that George has hung up on him. The clock on Potter's desk reads 8 minutes until 3 pm. The clock advances to 4:15 pm. Potter's phone rings. He receives bad news: the Building and Loan remains open. Customers are walking out calmly and with cash. Potter knows now that he will not sink the B&L; today. He clenches his fists tightly, frowns and stares at the metal skull that now sits in a prominent position on his office desk. A cab stops at a dilapidated house on Sycamore Street. Ernie, the cab driver helps the passenger, Mrs. Mary Bailey, to exit the cab and tries to keep her covered until she is under roof. Both enter the house and find only a single dim bulb lights up when they flip the switch. They stare at each other and shake their heads in dismay. A police car pulls up behind the taxi. Bert, the cop, approaches the house. Mary enters another room, out of sight. The two men talk and gesture, as they formulate a plan of action. Both agree, shake hands and run back to their vehicles to put their plan into action.
