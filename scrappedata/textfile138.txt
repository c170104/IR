[{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Because We Understand Each Other","Author":"xAmberChristine","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9889712","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The first time I met him was when I was six years old. I didn't plan on falling in love with him. Jesus Christ, at that age, I didn't even plan on finishing my vegetables. But no matter how long it's been, that day, I will never forget. It was the day my innocence fell apart and crumbled, I honestly don't know if it was for the better or for the worst. My family and I were visiting Ambrose because my dad happened to be good friends with Dr. Sinclair. The town was small but at the time still seemed quite… lively I guess you could say. I had been told we would only stay for the weekend, but of course, I ended up staying quite longer. But it wasn't exactly planned, at least if it was, I hadn't been informed. Early Friday morning we got packed and got dressed nice, a little bit nicer than we usually did, for a reason no one ever explained. Then we were off on a trip. It took about three hours excluding my dad having to pull over for directions about five times. But eventually, just around noon, we arrived. It wasn't hard to find the Sinclair's home. As soon as we drove in we saw Dr. Sinclair standing outside holding the hand of a young boy with tousled hair that appeared to have an inch of grease clinging to it. He looked dirty: the way a young boy around his age normally looks after coming in from a day of playing with his siblings. His appearance matched his clothes: they were tattered and covered in little grass and dirt stains. Dr. Sinclair appeared to be looking for someone. When he saw my parents' car entering the small town he frantically waved over to us, motioning us to pull in and park, and have a good time. As we were driving closer towards their house my mother looked to the backseat and whispered to me and my older brother Adam to not say anything about little Vincent and the way he looked. \"Ma, how are we supposed to know who he is if we can't say anything?\" Adam asked my mom, tilting his head to the side, and swinging his feet against her seat. \"Just trust me, you'll know who he is as soon as you see him…\" she replied, trailing off with a distant look, the kind people have when they seem to be remembering a troubling image. Both me and my brother looked at each other, then back to my mom, and nodded. Although now I was bursting with curiosity, wanting to see what was so special about Vincent, I kept my mouth shut. We pulled into the driveway and I let my eyes travel to the house. It was two stories and absolutely beautiful. The kind of house I had always imagined myself living in when I settled down and started a family of my own. The whole house was made out of bricks but they had been painted over with, what looked like, a grayish almost black color. The curtains were navy blue and the doors and roof were made of a dark brown wood. The whole house, actually, seemed dark compared to the sunny old fashioned style houses around it. But I liked it; it was very beautiful with all the contrasting colors. You could tell the Sinclair's must have put a lot of work and care into it. Meanwhile, in reality, my dad jumped out of the car and swung his arms around Dr. Sinclair's shoulders. \"Long time, no see man!\" my dad exclaimed and gave a strong high five to Dr. Sinclair. \"You too Gary! God, I haven't seen you in ages!\" Dr. Sinclair said as he wrapped his arms around my dad in a bear hug. My dad ran over to our car and unlocked the doors; excitedly telling us to come out and meet his old pal' Victor. My mother was the first to get out, she opened the door for Adam and whispered to him warningly to be a polite young gentlemen. I unbuckled my seat belt and nearly face planted the concrete driveway. Fortunately, I caught myself with my hands, and only got a few scrapes on my palms. ''Whoa there, little lady, are you okay?'' my father said jokingly as he picked me up and swung me into his arms. I nuzzled my face into his shoulder and used his collar to wipe away the tear stains forming on my cheek. ''That must be your daughter; Aubrey.'' Victor said smiling. The boy next to him had run off into the house by this point yelling to someone about us arriving. ''C'mon, kids'' my dad said motioning for me and my brother to follow him. ''Let's go meet the rest of the family.'' Adam and I followed our mother into the Sinclair's home. It was just as gorgeous inside as outside. As soon as you walked in you could see the living room to your left, with dark leather couches and beige walls. The floors were dark chestnut colored wood; they were glossy and shined, as if they had just been cleaned. The whole house in fact must have just been cleaned. You could smell a faint citrus scent, the kind of lemony smell that only was produced by washing all the counters and windows. I was in love, the house seemed so cozy. Suddenly a petite woman with a slender figure walked out of what I assumed was the kitchen. She smiled at us and took another puff of her cigarette she was holding. She tapped off the ashes into an ash tray and introduced herself as Trudy. She has blonde, slightly wavy hair. She was gorgeous; she looked like she just stepped out of a magazine advertising the latest spring fashion. The young boy I had saw earlier outside with Victor poked his head from around the kitchen with a bottle of soda in his hand. His name was Lester apparently, and even though it didn't match his looks, he seemed polite enough. \"Bo! Vincent!\" she exclaimed, clapping her hands and blowing out a puff of smoke at the same time, \"our guests are here! Come say hello!\" Instantly a young boy, as if he had waiting for such a signal, with dark brown curly hair cascaded down the stair ramp and slammed into the wooden floors. \"Hellloooooo!\" the boy with curly hair yelled while doing a clumsy bow, \"my name is Bo, and don't wear it out! Heh, but you can call me anytime sweetheart\" He winked at me and clicked his tongue in the back of his mouth. Even for such a young tender age, this remark made me burst into a fit of giggles. Which Bo seemed to enjoy a lot, as he broke into a huge toothy grin. \"Bo, Be polite!\" Trudy said, smacking the young child in the back of the head. He flinched, as if he was expecting it before her hand landed. Although it wasn't that hard, the gesture seemed to leave a small yet long period of awkward silence, as if time stopped itself. After a few moments of scolding from her, the rowdy young boy muffled an apology and glared daggers at the floor. Quietly, a polar opposite move from the boy before him, another young son creped down the stairs slowly. He poked his head out and our eyes met, a shiver went through my small body and I trembled. I could feel goose bumps forming on my exposed arms and legs. Although my mother had been right, because I knew his name before he was introduced. I could definitely tell. \"Ah there you are Vincent!\" Victor smiled and picked up the boy in a tight bear hug. He placed him down and grinned, patting his other son on the back. The boy timidly shrunk behind his father's legs, but not before I could see it. His skin, on his face… it was, perfect. So perfect I knew it couldn't be real. It looked, creamy, and on the right side, where the other eye should have been… there was just a pitch black hole. His hair fell slightly below his chin and unlike his brothers, wasn't as curly. Almost perfectly straight with a slight curl at the end. Even with that mask on, he was handsome. And I instantly felt a pang of warmth in my chest. My face slightly flushed red and I looked away quickly to hide it. \"H-Hi… my name's Vincent.\" He said quietly, almost like a whisper only to be heard by certain people. And he was looking right at me, his eyes piercing every fiber of my being. ","Summary":" The first time I met him was when I was six years old. I didn't plan on falling in love with him.

Rising the spirits to the darkness it held as the trees took their gnarled hands and stretched their way towards the skeletal moon. Creatures crawling with blood stained claws search for their….\" \"Can we suspense with the dramatics please?\" \"Well I don't see you coming up with anything better.\" \"I can too if I felt the need to.\" \"You are such a liar!\" \"Oh yeah! Well here's what you are!\" An all-out brawl was ensured by the way the two had started. The only one who remained quiet was their friend, Analise was her name. A girl who hid her face behind a current of dark hair. Shy and sweet she was. A child born from sorrow. Sorrow that was made apparent upon the sight of blood. Analise in a small voice called out to her two companions. The stopped their bickering. Still fuming with each other they separated. One left the back porch for the kitchen as the other moved closer to Analise. \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Look about the fighting…\" \"It's okay. I'm use to the two of you fighting like that.\" \"Still…\" \"Mary, listen. You two fight all the time. Neither of you raise your fists towards each other nor are the words used harsh. Rather childish actually, so I see nothing to worry.\" \"We just want to make sure that you don't see this as something that…\" Mary let the sentence hang. Not wishing for the reaction she believed could ensue. \"I'm going to go for a walk. I will be back soon.\" She rose in a swirling cloak. Old fashioned I know, but the girl loved old fashioned things. Left without the slightest space for protest to come from her guardian, Mary. Though there was plenty she had. Analise wasn't as strong as she made herself seem. Crossing over the slippery rocks delicately as a ballet dancer in performance. The brook's water glided through with precision for its mission was to meet the river. Analise followed the river like a curious child. Though you couldn't call her that at all. She was not a child. Nearly a grown woman, now. Still her innocence stayed about her like a coat one always wears. Her innocent curiosity got her into trouble when she arrived at the riverbed. On the shores lay a large object. Her mind told her to go past it, but her body moved forward. Closer and closer she came to the strange image. To find that it was a body. Her pace quickened. Collapsing to the side she moved the body to its front. She laid her head upon the chest listening for a heartbeat. Satisfied to find the body breathing and the heart beating well. Upon close inspection the body was that of a young man. His long hair hung over his face. 'That's not good for your breathing.' She thought. She moved the wet strands away. It revealed something that shocked her. The man's face was horribly scarred on one side. Attentively she touched the flesh. He stirred a little, but did not wake. She stared more at the man not feeling any sense of fear. Returning to her work she started her task. She moved the body further from the shore. An exhausting task on her hand. When she had placed the man against a tree in a way that would be comfortable. She looked to the sky. The time had gone by much quicker than she had hoped. Mary would want her home soon. She was about to leave when she saw the man stir again. If he wakes he will be cold she thought. Untying the cloak from her shoulders, she placed it over the man's body. Caringly she smoothed the fabric out to wrap the unconscious man. After the task was done she left with only one last glance. She arrived back home without a fuss. Unaware that someone had followed. Yes, just who was he? The man had woken right when the girl had placed the cloak over him. He kept up the appearance to see what she would do next. When he saw that she was leaving he followed. Surprised he was to find a house out here in the woods so close to Ambrose. He had thought that all had left. Apparently Lester had not told Bo and him everything. \"You were cutting it close Analise.\" Said a woman who came down the steps of a large back porch. \"I got distracted.\" The girl moved back a little. Her arms folded behind her as her head hung low. \"It is alright. No need to act so scared. Now come on time for dinner.\" She took the girl's hand and leads her inside. Vincent follows but is sure to stay in the shadows. At the dinner table were just the two females and the one man who was busy placing things on the table. The girl sat in silence while the other two talked. Vincent watched the whole dinner go on. His eyes never leaving the girl. He kept his eyes locked on her as she went up the stairs towards what he believed was her room. Old fashioned in style of Victorian era. He only looked away once when she was dressing. When he looked back he saw that she had changed into a long white nightgown. She moved to the vanity to brush her hair. How good she would look in wax he thought, but what human didn't to him. Perhaps he would mold her into Victorian style something she obviously liked. He should at least make her stature comfortable since she had helped him. He watched on into the night as she readied herself for bed. Taking time to read a worn out book. \"I knew I would find you reading this.\" Came the woman from before. \"I like the story. Is that a problem?\" \"No, Raoul is a great catch though isn't he?\" \"He is average.\" \"Average.\" \"The common hero. Not like Erik.\" \"The Phantom? How is he a hero? He killed about five people and what of his scars?\" \"He is painted as a monster, only because of his deformities. He became the image that others made for him. He is a person. I believe that he really didn't want to kill anybody. He let Christine go. Even though it hurt him to do so. The love in his heart let him see the truth. He died with a human heart.\" Her eyes they grew warm. He noticed. A sudden urge to enter the room and take her away nipped at him. He couldn't understand why. Not at all. The woman soon left and the girl lay her head down to sleep. Vincent managed to sneak into the house with no trouble. He went up to the sleeping girl. Peaceful and odd, holding a book in her sleep he thought as he looked upon her before gathering her in his arms. He moved stealthily out of the house and into the woods. Careful not to do anything to wake the girl. In little time they made it to Amborse. His home. Soon to be her home. Only as a wax figurine. Pain lurched through him at the thought. Why? Why, he did not know. She was a girl like the others. \"Hmm.\" The small sound wafted from her throat. Vincent's body stiffens at the sound. Fearing she had woken up. She stirred a little, and her eyes fluttered open. She did not scream, her eyes they widened and her mouth hung open a little, but no scream was uttered. She started into his eyes. \"What are you doing with me?\" Her light voice asked. Vincent didn't answer. He was too shocked from the girl not screaming in his face. Even his own brother had screamed once at him. \"Can you\" Her eyes darted to the side and a blush formed on her cheeks. \"Tell me your name?\" \"Vincent.\" He was surprised by how his voice sounded. Loud and demanding. \"Vincent.\" She said. He liked the way that his name sounded on her lips. Perhaps he could have her figurine hold a voice box so that he could hear it again. He moved forward towards their destination. She didn't move. Didn't protest. Did she not realize what was to come? Did she not see that she was going to die soon? These thoughts crossed his mind. When he reached the door to his 'house', he found she was once more asleep. Beautiful. He pushed the thought aside as he opened the door. He found his brothers were in there. \"Who's the bitch?\" Bo said while he leered over the girl in Vincent's arms. In reflex Vincent pulled the girl away from Bo's gaze. \"Fine. I won't interfere with your creativity. Though I would like some time alone with her.\" Vincent felt his veins throb in his neck. Talking like that about his figurine. \"Hold on now! You're not using her as a wax dummy!\" Lester said taking the girl out of Vincent's arms. Infuriating his brother. \"Why are you against this? You want to screw her or something?\" Cocky as always Bo. \"No, she is the godchild of the family that owns the cabin not far from here. They have connections. Connections that could expose us and end us. We can't afford to raise alarms with them. Vincent you have to return her now and never bother her again.\" \"Why? We can just kill the whole family off.\" \"Bo, do you realize how stupid you sound? This family has all kinds of cases of emergency protocol that it is impossible for them to disappear without raising a thousand alarms! Now stop gabbing and Vincent take her back.\" He placed the girl back into Vincent's arms. Lester then shoved them out the door. It was nearing daylight. He had to get her back up there before the people would notice her disappearance. He took the shortcut through the woods. Making it in time to place her back into her bed. He didn't have enough time to get out. Since her guardian came in through the door. He hid in the closet only opened a crack so he could see an opening. \"Wake up sleepy head.\" The woman said in an annoying chipper voice. \"Hmm. Is it morning already?\" \"You must have had a great sleep, Analise.\" Analise. The name tasted sweet upon his lips as he said it softly to himself. \"I did. I had a wonderful dream.\" \"What about?\" Probably some handsome prince. Like everyone else. Vincent thought bitterly. \"I dreamt that the Phantom came after me.\" \"Is that a good thing?\" \"He was like a mixture of the book and the play. He still had the deformity, but he was also handsome in a way and the way he held me close. His arms felt warm against my skin. His touch was firm, but gentle.\" \"Sounds like a good dream.\" \"Except his name was different.\" \"How so? Did he spell it for you?\" \"No. It wasn't Erik. He said his name was Vincent. I wonder if I will see him again.\" She thinks I'm handsome and she wants to see me again? Vincent had never been told anything like that before. No one had ever been that way towards him. \"Well. A good dream does come back again sometimes. Now let's get you out of bed. We have your party to plan. Are you sure you want to go with this theme?\" \"After last night's dream. I am certain.\" She rose from the bed. The gown swirling around her as she walked to her vanity and began brushing her long hair. Oh how he longed to run his fingers through her hair. The soft tresses that shone in the light creating desire throughout his body of him creating her sculpture. Her guardian came up to a dresser and picked a sun dress for her to wear. She dressed and they left signaling for him to depart. For the next three days Vincent's thoughts were filled the girl Analise. At first he thought it was just because of ideas he had for her figurine, but then the thoughts turned towards ones of flesh. Caresses and kisses. Longings and Desires. He wanted this girl. He wanted her alive. Cue Bo coming downstairs. \"Hey can you believe this? Lester got invited to a party!\" Party? Analise's guardian did mention something about a party. \"You're just jealous. Cause you weren't invited. Can I help it if the family likes that I help them and they want to repay me with going to a party? The answer is not your business.\" \"Is it for her?\" Lester wasn't sure how to answer this. He could tell the truth, but it could mean that his brother might go after her again. \"Yes. It is.\" \"When is it?\" \"You're not going to do something stupid are you?\" \"I have to see her again. I promise not to harm her. I want to see Analise.\" Lester was surprised. Vincent never bothered with others names. \"What do you know the Freak has a crush!\" Bo laughed out loud at his revelation. Lester was quick to give him an icy glare. \"The party is three days from now. Which gives us time to get you a tux and you may want to start a new mask.\" \"Why?\" \"Let's just say that it will go with the theme.\" Three days later the party was held in grand affair. Large and lavish, outfitted at the grandest building around the area. Inside it was decorated like the grand opera house of Paris. Crystal chandlers, stone steps, elegant dance floor. The whole setting was a masquerade ball. Everywhere you looked there was a mask. Some of ferocious animals. Others outfitted with feathers, sequins or silk ribbons and still there were some who stuck to the traditional Harlequin masks. The masks belonged to women and men wearing dresses and tuxedos. The most beautiful dress belonged to the only one who did not wear a mask. \"So what's your plan Phantom?\" Bo asked obviously annoyed with having to be in this place. \"She's beautiful.\" \"Is he even listening to me?\" \"Shut up Bo. Let him have a night.\" Vincent walked among the crowds, heading towards his obsession. The one who bore in his mind desires and dreams. Analise, he was going to have her. Even if it was for the one night. He approached her white dress the one that looked exactly like Christine's, clad figure. \"May I have this dance?\" Analise was surprised to see the man before her. He wore a white mask that covered half his face, his hair tied back into a ponytail and cape that flowed gently over his shoulders. \"You may.\" She blushed as he took her hand. Leading her to the dance floor. The two waltzed. The whole time Analise wondered if it was the one from her dream. The feeling of warmth from being in his arms. One side of his face looked the same on one side, but his mask covered the other. She wanted to know if he was the one and she had an idea on how to find out. \"I didn't catch your name. Will you tell me it?\" \"Maybe I will or maybe you can guess it?\" \"So we have met before?\" Vincent smiled down at her as he led her farther from the group. \"Is your name Will?\" \"No.\" \"John?\" \"Afraid not.\" \"Is it a common name?\" He didn't answer her. \"Oh I see. You want to keep up with air of mystery you have.\" \"Isn't that what the Phantom would want?\" It's a sign she thought. He is the one from the dream. \"Here is my last guess. Is your name Vincent?\" He stops their dance and gently strokes her cheek. She eases into his touch placing her hand over his. While his lips latch onto hers in a soul searing kiss. Arms wrap around each other as the kiss continues on. Two sets of eyes watch the two. One was shocked out of his mind and the other was wondering how to figure a way to deal with the consequences. The kiss is soon broken for the need of air. Vincent pulls Analise closer to him as she rests her head on his shoulder. \"Analise, do you remember the man you saved from the river?\" \"Yes, I know he is you.\" \"How do…\" \"Why else would you bring it up? I also remember the scar.\" Vincent's muscles tighten a little as well as his grip. His veins throb and his eyes slit. \"Vincent? What's the matter?\" Her hands cup his face. Worry seen in her eyes. The worry was also shared by the watchers. They weren't sure if they should jump out and steal him away. \"Please, Vincent.\" Vincent finally relaxed into her touch. \"Your scar doesn't bother me. I don't want you to think that.\" She kisses his cheek, making a trail to his lips with sweet chaste kisses. He returns the kisses with those of his own from her lips to her neck. Earning a moan from her throat. Enticing him to let his hands roam her body. Till. \"Vincent, please. Not here. Not now.\" Annoyance was clearly written in his face, but he listened to her wishes. His hands returned from their roaming to cup her face gently. \"You are beautiful.\" She blushed at his simple words. Enticing a smile to form on his lips. Lips that soon found their way back to hers. They savor the sweet kiss. One that he knew he would treasure. He had to leave now before anyone would notice him. He made a move to leave only to feel a tug on his sleeve. He looked to find her hand holding his arm. \"Where are you going?\" \"I have to leave now. I will see you again soon.\" \"When?\" \"Tomorrow night. I promise.\" He gave her a quick kiss before disappearing form view. Analise returned to her party. Which ended soon after her return to it. Throughout the night both held dreams of each other in their minds. Truth be told when daylight shone. Vincent was anxious for the night to come. To go back to her. His brothers watched as he stood then paced back and forth. Ignoring his unfinished sculptures, finding them to tedious to work with that day. Lovesick was Vincent. They could see it plain as day. It made them uneasy on how to deal with him at the moment. They stood silent and stayed far away from him. Once dusk had set in. He wasted no time in leaving. His ran all the way over rocks, tree roots and other obstacles. Nothing would stop him from reaching her. By the time he reached the house. It was dark enough to conceal his presence. The lights were still on. The man and woman were in a downstairs room. Upon closer inspection he could see that Analise was not with them. He climbed up to her window and saw that she was sitting at the window, reading a little book. He tapped lightly on the glass. She turned her head and smiled at him. Opening the window to allow him entry into her room. Before he came in he kissed her lips. Missing the sweet taste of her lips. \"I told you that I would come.\" \"I never doubted you would.\" She circled her arms around his neck while his encircled her waist. The night passed quickly for the two as they spent the night getting to know each other. For three weeks this became the norm. The two would meet at night and sped every minute they could together. Talking about what they liked or didn't like, she would read with him and he would bring her little wax sculptures he had made of animals. Making sure to never use an animal's real body for the ones he gave her. She found them to be amazing creations. This kept him smiling throughout the day when he was separated from her. He hated the hours away from her. Thoughts of stealing her away forever where it was only the two of them entered his mind, but soon found their exit when it came to Lester's reasoning. \"Why do you look so sad?\" Analise's eyes poured into his with worry. \"The night is ending too soon. Summer nights are far too short.\" \"They are ending though. Soon the nights will grow longer and we can be together far longer than we can now.\" She said as she laid her hand onto his chest. His smile forms as he steals a kiss. \"Would you ever consider running away with me?\" The girl was shocked. The question was one that she didn't know how to respond. Vincent thought that it was a simple question and could not understand her hesitance. \"Well?\" \"I-I don't know.\" \"What?\" \"I love you Vincent, but I can't run away with you. I wouldn't be able to live.\" \"I can provide for you. It may not be this palace you live in now, but you will never have to worry about necessities.\" \"It's not that Vincent. I have to stay here. This place is what keeps me alive.\" \"That doesn't make sense.\" She darts her eyes away contemplating on what to do. She took a deep breath and then told him the secret she kept inside. \"I'm sick Vincent. I have been sick for a long time. The doctors aren't sure what it is, but they know that it could be fatal if it's not carefully monitored. Andrew, my godfather didn't want me to live in a hospital for the rest of my life so we moved out here and he outfitted the house so that my health could be monitored while I live a close to normal life.\" \"I never would have thought that.\" \"I know. I don't tell people, they act different when they find out.\" Vincent wasn't sure how to respond. All this time he had spent with her and he never saw any hit of this. She appeared to be the picture of health to him, but as he took a look closer he saw that her skin was paler than it should be, her eyes held exhaustion and tiny limbs looked as delicate as porcelain. In comfort he placed his arms around her and held as close as he could without hurting her. \"I love you Analise. I will always love you.\" The words sounded cheesy but he meant them just the same. Analise looked up at the man who held her so close into his arms. A smile came up from her heart and the words reflected them. She told him of her love for him. Vincent felt complete and whole something he didn't know could happen. Four months later he made love to her for the first time, three months later her health declined, two months later she died, one month later he joined her. Lester laid his brother to rest next to her grave. Their graves lie in a wooded area that is scenic and peaceful. Where people say that if you look closely you can see two people embracing each other. ","Summary":" \"The winds blew through with a howling tune of terror.

I smiled looking into the mirror as I brushed my brothers long hair I could see his eye close in content before he jumped up as the door slammed open and our oldest brother Lester walked in with piles of clothes in his hands, throwing some to me I caught them clumsily \"Here Lottie try these, I think they're some good stuff in there\" I nodded sadly thinking about whom they might have killed or maimed to get these clothes but I was too terrified of my two eldest brothers to say anything \"Thank you Lester\" Lester just nodded and pressed a small kiss to my head as I walk passed him. Throwing the clothes onto the rickety bed in my room I began to sort threw them casting a look around my room I sighed seeing all the jewellery, clothes, shoes, bags and other things the boys had brought home for me; any girl would have thought herself lucky having all this nice stuff and I would have too if they had ripped it off a dead woman's body. \"Charlotte!\" I jumped hearing the worst voice ever, Bo, he was Vincent's twin but they were nothing alike, Vince was actually nice and had a heart but we were both too afraid and loved our little family too much to leave. \"Comin'\" I called back softly walking back down the creaky stairs and to the lounge where my Lester and Bo had set up the pool table, Bo turned to me with a genuine smile \"Hey princess\" I smiled dad used to call me that \"We decided that tonight you'll come huntin' with me\" I shot my head to Vincent but he shook his head he didn't decide this, Bo turned back to Lester \"If we set up some tacks on the road someone is bound to show up\" Bo set the pool cue down before putting his arm around me \"Now you don't actually have to kill the poor bastard but I want you to see how it's done so when your time comes you're ready\" I just slowly nodded moving away from Bo and putting my arms around myself. \"Well go and get ready, oh and put on something you don't mind getting dirty\" Bo said with a nasty smile, walking up the stairs I could hear Lester and Bo talking about how good it'll be for me and It'll be easy seeing as I already know how to fight and shoot, I learnt how to fight and hunt long before I found out my brothers were murderers and then they tried to tell me it was so we could finish my mothers dream of building wax sculptures. After changing I sat on my bed and played with the stray ends of my blanket until I heard a soft knock at the door and Vincent's head pop round \"Hey\" I murmured when he sat next to me and pulled me into a small hug, Vincent was definitely my favourite brother I don't think he likes killing either but he wants to help create mom's dream. \"Charlotte! Are you ready\" my bedroom door slammed open and Bo looked angry \"What the hell are you doin' in here, you're supposed to be getting those two I brought here earlier ready\" Vincent jumped up when Bo started shouting at him and shook a little \"Can't you see Charlotte is getting ready to help us, you're going to make her soft like you now get. Get!\" Bo shouted causing Vincent to run back downstairs. Bo turned to me smiling again like nothing had happened \"Ready princess?\" I nodded silently not wanting to upset my brother. \"Come on now\" he beckoned with his hand leading me down the stairs to where Lester stood waiting \"Now you do as Bo says and stay out of trouble, ya hear?\" looking back and forth between my brothers I sighed \"Yeah I hear\" Lester smiled showing his black teeth \"Good, here take this just in case\" my eyes opened wide when he put his bowie knife in my hand \"but this is your bowie\" Lester shrugged casually rubbing the back of his neck \"I got more bowie's but I only got one of you\" I smiled taking the knife from him as Bo put his hands on my shoulders \"Come on then let's go\" Walking outside I saw the tow truck waiting for us and look at Bo confused \"Don't worry Lottie It's all part of the plan\" nodding I climbed into the car and wished I was somewhere else, someone else. / We had been sitting in the tow truck for an hour now silently and it was getting late and dark, I was just falling asleep when a pair of car headlights could be seen in the distance and my stomach dropped this was it I was about to witness a murder and my brother wanted my to help, my life would never be the same from this point on as I seemed to worry about this my brothers face split into a manic grin \"Well well about damn time\" he drawled lighting himself a cigarette. I looked back to the lights and the closer they got the quicker my heart seemed to beat. Bo turned off all the lights making it pitch black \"What are you doing that car could hit us\" I asked him worried as he smirked at me \"Don't worry princess we'll be fine\" I looked at him with my eyes wide I felt like I could hear my heart beating in my ears I closed my eyes tight before hearing a bang and tires screeching. Opening my eyes I saw a car had stopped on the side of the road with the headlights still on, we watched at the car door opened and a woman got out looking around the car \"Stupid bitch\" Bo muttered opening the window and throwing out his burnt out cigarette, I watched the woman pull out her phone and put it to her ear obviously calling for help. \"Ready princess\" Bo asked and laughed when I shook my head \"Don't worry you'll be a natural\" I smiled slightly It was nice when my brothers complimented me. Starting the car Bo looked at me confused when I put my hand on his arm \"Lights\" I muttered as he laughed again. Turning on the lights Bo turned to me \"Camera, Action\" I sighed and glared at him \"That would have been funny if someone wasn't about to die. Driving closer to the woman I squinted as the headlights of her car made it hard to see but as she put her hand in front of her I could see she had the same problem \"Hello?\" she called out she looked annoyed \"Hello?\" she called again walking towards us a couple of steps until Bo reversed, The woman started to walk forward again until Bo reversed again. The woman didn't look so annoyed now I could also see fear on her face as she turned back to her car and walk away Bo pulled off and sped up I screamed along with the woman when he grabbed her head from the window and drug her with us for a couple of seconds before propelling her through the window of her car. We stopped dead behind her car and I put my hand to my chest trying to control my breathing and my sanity. I sat there as Bo opened the car and got out suddenly my door was opened \"Are you ok?\" My older brother called softly I nodded slowly still not looking at him \"Charlotte..Look at me princess\" turning my head I looked at Bo \"That happened so fast\" I whispered if I talked any louder I probably would have cried Bo just smiled softly at me \"They're not always like that\" he told me nodding behind us \"Come on I want you to see it\" I looked at him shocked and shook my head \"I don't want to\" I whispered once again Bo sighed before grabbing my hand \"Come one Charlotte there's no room for discussion on this\" Letting Bo pull me out of the truck I wrapped my arms around myself. Peeking around the car I gagged at the sight of the woman she was obviously dead but her eyes were open like she was staring at me. Bo jumped onto the hood of the car and groaned pulling the woman from out of the windshield \"Charlotte can you drive the truck in front of the car?\" Bo stopped pulling at the woman and threw the keys a me before turning back to the woman \"Now Charlotte\" I jumped before running to the truck and turning it around before reversing it back to the woman's car. Getting out of the truck I stopped dead seeing Bo had finally gotten the woman out of the windscreen and was lay in his arms lifeless \"Charlotte get the door\" Bo asked groaning before throwing the woman in the backseat of her car carelessly \"Damn she was a pretty one\" I looked at him disgusted before nodding \"She coulda won one of those pageants they used to have in town\" Bo nodded \"I think we found our Miss Ambrose\" He told me smirking before turning to the truck and getting the car ready to tow, I looked back to the dead woman \"I'm sorry\".

Henry \"My lovely Sara you've returned to me.\" Sara \"I never gave up hope that you were alive.\" Henry \"I wanted to come find you but I was scared.\" Sara \"Why were you scared.\" Henry \"Sara I want to show you something, but you have to promise me that you scream or be scared.\" Sara \"I promise.\" Sara got off Henry's lap, and Henry got up out of his wheelchair. He turned to look at Sara he removed his mask made of wax to show Sara what happened to his face because of the fire. Sara began to cry then she walked up to him, and kissed Henry. Henry kissed her back. Sara \"My poor Henry I'm here I'll never leave you never I'll help you get better.\" Henry \"You won't run away I see the fear in your eyes Sara.\" Sara \"It's not fear Henry it's love, and no I won't run away.\" Henry \"I don't disgust you?\" Sara \"Henry Jarrod you never could disgust me ,you are still my handsome Henry come to my house stay with me, and Katie please?\" Henry \"Alright I'll come with you.\" Sara \"Great you'll love our house you can sleep with me.\" Henry \"Just like the old days.\" Sara \"Yes just like the old days.\" Sara, and Henry went to Sara's house. When they got there Sara showed Henry to her room. Henry walked into Sara's room,and sat down on the bed. Sara walked into the bathroom, and changed into her nightdress. She walked out of the bathroom, walked over the closet that she saved for Henry, got him a set of pajamas, and handed them to him. Henry went into the bathroom, and changed when he walked out Sara was laying on the bed waiting for him. Henry \"It's been a long time since you waited for me.\"Sara \"Yes it has, but no more waiting you're here now please join me in bed Henry?\" Henry \"I'd love to.\" Sara \"I know your scared Henry because we haven't made love in so long you,re scared that you'll hurt me.\" Henry \"Yes I'm scared I'll hurt you.\" Sara \"If you do it will be alright I won't turn you away come to me Henry make love to me just like you used to.\" Henry \"If you're sure.\" Sara \"I'm sure.\" Henry joined Sara in bed.

Henry ran away from where Sue Allan was staying, and returned to his wife Sara. He was so set on making Sue Allan his new Marie Antoinette he couldn't get the idea of Sue Allan as his new Marie Antoinette out of his mind. But for now he'd be with his wife again. The next day at the House Of Wax Scott Andrews was working on a head for one of Henry's new wax figures. Scott just happened to mention that it Sue Allan's birthday and that she was going to meet him there. Henry asked him to get the flowers for next wax figure. Sara just happened to walk in and find Henry sitting in the back room. Sara \"Hello Henry Katie is here to be your model for your Marie Antoinette.\" Henry \"Thank you Sara I didn't even think of using Katie as a model.\" Sara \"Your welcome Henry.\" Henry \"Sara What's wrong ?\" Sara Henry nothing is wrong I just went to the doctors for a check up,and they said I'm fine they also said our new baby is fine too.\" Henry \"New baby are they sure?\" Sara \"Yes we are going have a baby.\" Henry \"Come and sit with me Sara I'm so happy.\" Sara \"I'm happy too I have you back, and now a new baby on the way.\" Henry \"Life is finally the way it used to be for us.\" Sara \"Yes it is marry me again Henry?\" Henry \"I'd love to.\" Sara \"Then we are getting married.\" Henry \"Yes we are.\" Sara \"Lets go check on Katie.\" Henry \"Good idea I'll meet you down there I have to take my own way down to the basement.\" Sara \"Okay.\" Sara took the stairs, and Henry took his wheelchair ramp. When Sara reached the basement she let out a scream of fright. Henry reached the basement after Sara screamed. Henry \"What's wrong Sara,oh my god!\" Sara Katie \"Oh my god Katie baby speak to me Katie No No No.\" Henry \"Oh our poor Katie.\" Katie was dead she was strangled to death, and was about to be put the under the wax. Sara picked up her daughter ,and carried her up the stairs. She ran to her house carried Katie upstairs ,and laid her down on her bed. Then she ran to the phone,and called the police.

He had begun to speak a lot more recently, ever since the other week when she'd asked him to talk. Only to her mind you, he stayed silent when Bo was around. It was better that way anyway; Bo would only tease him about his voice. She smiled and watched Vincent paint the finishing touches to the new figure. \"I don't think he's ever really liked me, He'll probably get rid of me at some point\" Bella said standing up and walking towards Vincent to get a better look at the completed figure. Vincent shook his head. \"No, he won't\" \"What makes you think that?\" \"I'm not gonna let him\" Vincent whispered. Bella smiled softly and slid her hand into his. \"I don't understand?\" Vincent asked, shaking his head at the sight of their locked fingers. \"Understand what?\" she replied. \"Why you like me, I mean look at me.

Vincent nodded, and walked over to the bed in the corner of the room. \"Do you want me to stay here?\" she asked staring after him, Vincent looked up and nodded again. Bella walked over and lay down next to him; Vincent sighed and put an arm around her shoulders. Bella reached up and placed her fingers at the edge of his mask; Vincent stiffened slightly but made no attempt to stop her. Bella carefully pulled away the wax from his face and placed it on the table next to them. She smiled and traced fingertips around his face softly. Vincent shivered and held her closer breathing the smell of her hair. She reached up again and kissed him softly. It was only a brief peck, but Vincent blushed, his stomach in butterflies.

They were staying at a hotel while they waited for their parents to arrive. Nick had stressed out at the hospital, so they'd decided to go elsewhere. Carly smiled. Her little brother had always been wary of doctors and hospitals. Yes; her 'little' brother. When people found out they were twins, most assumed Nick was the elder. He was in fact, fifteen minutes younger tha her. Nick mumbled and twitched in his sleep and Carly's mind flashed back to Ambrose. She'd promised herself she wouldn't think about it, about them, not with the memories so fresh but she couldn't help it. Paige, Blake, Dalton and Wade were dead because of two homicidal maniacs and she'd almost lost her brother. Carly thought about Bo and Vincent's deaths. Their demise didn't bring the expected fear or guilt. She had killed them to protect herself and her brother and she was okay with that. She shifted in her chair beside Nick's bed. He was out cold because of the painkillers he'd been given at the hospital. She'd been given them too, but the drug-induced haziness did nothing to dispel the nightmares. Seeing Nick die repeatedly in her mind pushed all thoughts of sleep out of her brain. Now she sat watching him sleep to assure herself that he was still breathing. Carly was lost in thought when Nick startled her with a small noise. She leaned forward to take a closer look at him. Nick was lying on his back on the bed. His brow was furrowed and his fingers had a tight grip on the blanket. Carly crawled up on the bed and maneuvered them so she was on his left side with her arm around his waist. Nick instinctively wrapped his arm around her shoulders. He whimpered and tightened his grip on her and the blanket. She rested her head on his chest. \"Shh. It's alright, Nicky. Everything's going to be okay.\" Carly continued to mumble assurances until his grip loosened and he relaxed back into a more peaceful slumber. Carly dozed listening to his heartbeat. As she drifted off, a thought crossed her mind. She would do anything for her brother and she knew he would do the same. After all, isn't that what family's for? End.

He shook his head again. \"Because you think you're ugly?\" He nodded sadly looking away again. She caught his sleeve and smiled. \"Why don't you let me be the judge of that eh?\" Vincent stared at his friend for what seemed like a lifetime before finally moving his hands up to his head and removing the wax mask plastered on his face. He cringed when the air hit his skin and looked down, ashamed. She brought her hand up to smooth his long hair away from his face; she smiled and ran soft finger tips across the contours of his face. Vincent flinched at the delicateness of her touch. He didn't understand why she didn't scream, runaway or shout abuse as Bo usually did. Her fingers still ran across his skin making him shiver. \"You're beautiful\" she said whispered quietly. Beautiful. The word ran through Vincent's mind like alarm bells.

This chapter takes place during the scene where Carly wakes up when they're camping and Wade won't accompany her to investigate the noise. I guess this is my take on what would have happened if Wade didn't wake up. I hunched over as I walked slowly around the desolate area. I wasn't too keen on camping here in the first place, but after the run in with the rambunctious redneck, I was pretty sure it was the worst idea ever. I wasn't even sure why I'd come out here alone, but it wasn't as if Wade would have protected me anyway. Sure, he was a nice guy and all, but he wasn't much more than that. After surveying the area to my liking, I turned to sneak back into the tent. I gasped as I felt a warm hand slide around my stomach and the other clamp over my mouth. I tried to scream, but the obstruction muffled my voice. \"Do I have to babysit you 24/7?\" I relaxed when I realized that it was my twin brother who held me captive. He wouldn't hurt me. I sagged back against him. His hand left my mouth, but he made no move to release me from his embrace. \"What do you want Nick?\" I took a deep breath; thankful it wasn't someone was malicious intentions that had snuck up on me. He didn't answer me and nuzzled his face against my neck. My skin tingled from the stubble covering his cheek. Instead, he asked me a question of his own. \"Is pretty boy so bad in bed that you have to wander around looking for a real man to sate your needs?\" His hands were anything but brotherly as they traced the curves of my sides, hips and outer thighs. \"You know I'm not sleeping with Wade.\" I took a shuddering breath when I felt his warm lips press against my ear. Air puffed from between his lips. He smelled of beer, cigarettes and that musky soap he'd used since we were 14. \"I'd have snapped his neck if I thought you were.\" He said it simply, as if it were the most logical reaction in the world. His hand trailed over my flat stomach and inched under my shirt. He sighed contentedly when he felt the warm skin against his now chilled hands. \"What do you want Nick?\" I repeated the question I already knew the answer to. I'd known since our early teens, when I'd been deemed the good twin and he the bad. He wasn't a bad guy, not by a long shot. I knew I was partially responsible for his rebellious behavior. \"What I always want.\" He finally answered and I leaned back against his chest and shuddered when he whispered my name in a breathless tone. He hadn't started acting out until I began pulling away from him when we were 15. We were so close as kids and young teens, but as we got older the cuddling and kidding around turned into soft caresses and lusty gazes. Mom and Dad started questioning the innocence of our relationship and I'd freaked out. Incest is wrong. Especially of the twincest variety. I'd pulled away from him because I found it difficult to deflect his advances. I wasn't sure how much longer I'd be able to. As his hand crept higher under my shirt and his lips tugged on my earlobe, I became achingly aware that I didn't want to be the good twin anymore. I wanted to be bad with Nick. Is this worth continuing? Let me know! ","Summary":" Hey guys, This is my first House of wax fan fiction, but not my first twincest piece.

Carly Jones was strapped to a chair, in the basement of a grungy, unused gas station. She let loose a scream, eyes wide at the man in front of her. Where the fuck was everyone? Her heart beat twice as fast as normal and she kicked at the chair, failing to do anything productive. Suddenly, she heard the voices of her brother and Wade. Their footsteps drew closer, and Carly took a breath to yell. Her capturer leered at her, brandishing a weapon. He held it to her neck, and it dug in. Carly's voice caught in her throat. \"One word, and this is going through your throat, understand?\" he growled, completely serious. The young girl nodded fast, determined to make it out alive. Holding her mouth closed, Bo leaned over his work station, doing something unknown. He leaned forward, and Carly noticed he was holding a small squeeze tube of glue. Bo brought it down near her face, but Carly struggled and tried to push him off. It was a futile attempt, with the man being twice as strong, and she being taped to a chair. He positioned the tube by her mouth, and a warm, sticky substance came out, forcing her mouth shut. Carly tried to scream, but it was impossible. It must have been some industrial strength super glue, for all she could do was make high pitched sounds as she teared up. \"Just stay still,\" Bo hissed creepily. \"I can see we have to close that pretty mouth of yours.\" He blew seductively onto her lips, and kissed her forehead. Carly felt disgusted having him so close to her, and only wondered what he might do when he knew they were rid of everyone else. She thrashed about in the chair as he left, locking the door behind him. Carly's survival instincts took over, and she shook her whole body, knowing there was a way out. As she kicked the metal arms of the chair, she noticed a small gear. Seeing as there was no other choice, she pushed at it, hoping it would release a lock or something. To her surprise, it went forwards, and the arm began to loosen. The captured girl worked at it, and sooner than she thought, the metal popped off. The arm was still taped to her wrist, but at least one was free. Her ears pricked, and she caught the sound of Nick, speaking to the deranged guy who owned this place. Carly made more noise, but it was pointless. He couldn't hear her, and even if he could, it's not like he'd know where she was or how to help. She stood on the chair, looking up through the grate, seeing his footsteps. \"What was that?\" Nick asked, his voice coming from far away. Yes! He heard her. Carly screamed silently again, needing a way to alert her brother. She stuck her pointer finger up into the air through the metal, waving it around. As she did this, she looked down at her other arm, trying to free it somehow, but there was no way the metal would budge. \"Nothing, just my dog,\" replied Bo, with a sense of awkwardness in his voice. Carly heard the two talking, and she spastically moved her finger as fast as it would go. She couldn't see through the grate, but she knew it was noticed. 'C'mon, Nick,' she thought desperately, 'look over here, just look' - But her thoughts were cut short, as a searing pain went through her hand, nothing she'd ever felt before. She immediately brought her hand back down, blood spurting up from the top like a broken water fountain. Carly screamed in pain, without making any actual noise except for the incomprehensible sounds Nick had heard. The pain was making her feel dizzy, and she knew she had to do something before her brother left. She sat down into the chair, and pushed her bleeding finger into her borrowed shirt. Carly leaned her face down into her other hand, and used her good fingers to pry her mouth open. It hurt like fuck, but she knew it was her last chance. As the glue eased up, her mouth began to crack and bleed, but she almost had it... \"NICK\" she cried out. \"NICK! I'M DOWN HERE! NICK!\" Just then, everything went black, and Carly was falling, spiraling into a black hole, screaming her head off, until she felt warm, dry hands shaking her awake. \"Carly! Wake up, Car.. You're only dreaming,\" she heard, coming from a familiar voice. Opening her eyes, she looked into the face of her older brother, Nick. Her shirt was drenched with sweat, and her legs were shaking. She tried to speak, but she could only stutter. \"N- nick...\" Carly's teeth were chattering, despite how hot it was. She tried to sit up, but Nick gently pushed her back down onto her pillow. \"Carly. You had a dream. It's okay,\" Nick soothed her, sitting on the edge of her bed. He pulled the covers off his sister so that they were at the end of the bed, and he felt her clammy forehead. Carly couldn't think, or breathe, but she lay there for several minutes with Nick's hand on her head, regaining the use of both. What had just happened? she questioned, and it all hit her at once. Ambrose, Bo, Vincent, the House of Wax... and Paige, Blake, and Dalton's dead bodies all swam into her head at once. She looked at her stubby finger, and burst into violent tears. \"Hey, hey, whoa!\" Nick looked awkward, unsure of what to do. He had never been good with these situations, always letting Carly be the one to console people, deal with other people's shit. Nick never really cared, anyways. But when it came to his sister, especially after the situation in Ambrose, his feelings changed. A lot. He didn't really know how to describe it. It was like a complete one hundred eighty degree turn. Before the House of Wax, he was a generally angry person. Blamed everyone for his mistakes, didn't take anything seriously, and bugged the shit out of Carly. But now... Whenever he saw her, it was like his heart missed a beat. He constantly pictured her in his wifebeater, her curly hair framing her small face. It was only too easy to look back at the night that fucked everything up. Carly did it all the time. Nick had to come running into Carly's room at least once a week now, and shake her out of her stupor. She was really messed up, and it messed Nick up, and he wasn't sure how to deal with it. Carly continued to bawl, and Nick put his arms around the shaking girl. He wanted to say something, something to make it all better and maybe help her forget, but he knew she wouldn't, not for a long time. \"You're okay, Car. You're okay,\" Nick repeated into her hair as he hugged her. The feel of her skin against his neck and the smell of yesterday's perfume was making his stomach tighten into knots, and his leg throbbed where Bo's knife had been. He felt her shudder against him, and her sobs subsided into quieter cries. \"What... What were you dreaming of?\" he asked her hesitantly, not wanting to upset her further, but honestly curious. Carly hiccuped. It had seemed so real, so intense. And then she woke up, and she realized it was a dream. But when she saw the severed finger, she remember, it wasn't a dream. It was a faded memory, just like Wade. Wade was gone, and he was never coming back. They were going to move to New York together, she reminisced to herself. He had told her the night they stayed in the campsite in the tent together, but he didn't want her to let any of the others know. Especially not Nick. Wade and Nick were not on good terms, and the least thing anyone wanted was more of Nick's asshole attitude. Carly looked up at her twin, seeing her face copied perfectly into his, except for all of his male features. His strong jaw, his prominent cheekbones, his five o clock shadow. So much of Nick reminded Carly of Wade, and it made her heart hurt thinking about it. She gulped down some air. \"I... I don't know, Nick. I remember being in the basement with Bo, when he taped me to the chair. And when he... \" Carly seemed at a loss for words, and lifted up her left hand. She saw Nick's jaw clench, and she knew he was still hurting. He scooted closer to her. \"Carly...\" Nick didn't know what else to do, so he did the first thing that came to mind. Noticing her sweat soaked shirt, he pulled off his own, and handed it to her. \"Thanks,\" she breathed, and threw the blue V-neck of hers into a corner of her room, and pulled on her twin's black t - shirt. It was too big on her, but Nick liked that. Carly rubbed her face, and pushed her hair back. She was still shaking, but barely. If only Ambrose hadn't happened, if they had just gone straight to the football game like they should have, none of this would have happened. Paige would still be here, and she may even have been pregnant. Thinking about how her best friend would have had a noticable bump by now, and how she still hadn't deleted her number out of her phone made Carly's tears start up again. \"Nick,\" she coughed, \"Nick, will you just stay here with me, please?\" It was a pitiful question. Carly was 21, and she should be able to sleep in her own bed by herself. But it was not a problem, because Nick climbed in and lay beside his twin, wiping her tears away. He put his arm around her, and she pushed her face into his chest, her own chest heaving. It was like she couldn't stop crying, and she missed Wade so deeply. Nick's muscles felt like Wade's around her own, tiny arms, and Carly felt Nick's stubble brush against her face. Slowly, she calmed herself down, listening to Nick's heartbeat and the pleasure of having a warm body close to her. The more Carly wished for Wade, the more it felt like he was there, in the place of Nick. She knew it was a terrible thing, thinking of someone as another person, almost using them, but she didn't dare let Nick go. Carly feigned sleep, and daydreamed about kissing her old boyfriend. That was something she thought about the majority of the time. His soft lips on hers, a hand running through her curls. It was almost too much for Carly, and she squirmed with delight. Nick was having a hard time. Not with memories, not with anything having to do with the House of Wax or the people they lost. No, he was having a hard time with Carly. Why, did she have to look so peaceful and innocent as she slept? Her eyes closed, her hair a cute mess, his big, black t - shirt overpowering her tiny body? The only part of her Nick could see were the edges of her little pink bootyshorts, and that wasn't helping him. Carly made a little noise, a bit of an \"mmf\", and it drove Nick wild. She scooted closer to him and sighed. As her butt pushed up against Nick's boxers, she stopped dead. \"Fuck,\" Nick muttered through his teeth. He knew why she had stopped, and what the problem was. Why couldn't he control himself at least one goddamn time? This was so wrong. 'I need to get out of here,' he thought, and made to detach himself from Carly. But as he was getting up, her fingers reached out, and she pulled him back. \"Nick,\" she mumbled, her eyes still closed. She didn't want to open them. She wanted to feel Wade's loving caress again, not worry about anything. She wanted to touch, and feel, and forget. The elder twin looked down at his sister, clutching his shirt. Ignoring his better judgement, he lay back down with Carly. This was a perfect example of why brothers and sisters don't share beds after they hit puberty. He wanted Carly so bad, it almost hurt. Her fingers walked down Nick's arm, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head. Lids still tightly shut, Carly rolled on top of Nick, and lowered her lips to meet his. They were chapped, but still warm. And as Carly kissed harder, they became soft and wet. Nick didn't care anymore - he went for it as Carly offered it to him. Her breasts were pushed against him, and her smooth legs raked his rough ones. She intertwined a hand with his, and they kissed violently. At this point, Nick's leg wasn't the only thing throbbing. As fast as the embrace had started, it had ended. Nick pulled back, shocked at what was happening. What kind of a sick person was he, kissing his own twin? He sat up abruptly, his heart racing. Carly's eyes flew open from the sudden change of pace, and looked up at Nick. Baby blue eyes met brown ones, and Nick had to go, or else he'd do something he may regret. \"Carly, we can't fucking do this,\" he said, shaking his head. \"We just can't.\" Nick started to back away, but Carly grabbed at him again. \"Please, Nick... I need this.\" Carly's voice shook, and Nick's knees grew weak. She had affected him in all the wrong ways. He pictured himself with her, pulling her shirt off and her back arching. 'What's wrong with me?' he thought, confused and horny. \"I need you.\" That was all it took for Nick. He couldn't help himself, no matter how bad it was. He climbed onto Carly's body, and she shut her eyes, hating herself. \"Why d' you have to be so damn stubborn?\" she whispered. Alike all authors, I appreciate constructive criticism. Please take the time to leave a review!

Also featuring Glen Jacobs (Kane) as Joshua and Damon Herriman as Lester. Prologue: The cafe smelt of sweat, the taste of burnt toast hanging in the air as a group of six crowded around a table in the corner. A woman was stood behind the counter, hunched over, looking as bored as ever. Nick leaned back in his seat, gazing around his friends and at the woman, a smirk on his face. \"So, we all agree that camping would be a good idea?\" Nick's attention diverted back to James, the person that had just spoke, his eyes narrowing slightly before he glanced at Carly. \"It depends on where it is we're camping. Me and Nick had a bad experience involving camping.\" Snorting slightly at Carly's sentence Nick lifted up the bottle of beer he was hiding and took a sip, \"oh yeah, you could say that. Four of our friends getting killed by a pair of freaks then us two getting chased around a burning house of wax by the same mother fuckers. Yeah, bad experience.\" Carly sighed, staring at her brother, \"real smooth Nick. Real smooth.\" Grabbing her jacket from the back of her chair she stormed out of the cafe, walking around the corner and leaning against the wall, tears rolling down her cheeks as she thought about Wade and the others that had died. Nick slammed his fist onto the table before putting both hands up to his face, the others looking at each other in shock, all except for James who was frowning slightly and just staring at Nick, his mouth open slightly from the shock of what had just happened. Putting his hand on Nick's shoulder James stood up, \"i'll go speak with her.\" His eyes glanced at the others before he walked out of the building, carefully approaching Carly. \"Listen, Carly, that was bad judgement on my part. I should never have suggested going camping.\" He held his arms out as she took a few steps towards him, his arms finally wrapping around her as she hugged him tightly. \"It's ok, James. I've moved on. I'm with you now and that is all that matters,\" she paused glancing up at her boyfriend, \"us and our future is all I care about.\" Carly sighed and rested her head on James' shoulder, she lied and he knew that yet neither of them would prefer the truth. They both knew that Carly could never get over the events, no matter how hard she tried or however long she kept it a secret for. James had been the only person that had been told, until Nick had just blurted it out that was. The three of them had sworn to stay together and help each other through this, even though James hadn't been there and Nick wasn't exactly the most caring of people. Although, it was obvious he had taken a shine to Carly's new boyfriend unlike when she had been with Wade. At least one good thing had come out of those events: Nick's improved attitude. Nick moved his hands away from his face and looked at Samantha, Drew and Amanda - all of whom were staring at him. \"Ok, so we went to the wrong town. I dunno.\" He shrugged slightly before glancing at the door, his sister still outside with James. Nick's eyes fixed back on the others as he leaned towards them slightly, \"don't tell Carly I told you any of this.\" He looked at each one of them, staring them straight in the eyes. \"We was on our way to a football game in Louisiana. It started getting dark so we pulled over and made a camp for the night. Next morning we found out that the fan belt in Carly's boyfriend's car was broke.\" The others looked at each other before looking at the door. \"No, not James. He was called Wade. Anyway we met this guy who offered to drive Carly and Wade to the nearby town to get a new fan belt, while the rest of us go to the football game. As far as I am aware they got there and were unable to find an attendant at the auto mechanics shop, so they looked around and wandered into a church, disrupting a funeral. Except it wasn't a real funeral. So, after a while, they follow this guy, who owns the shop, up to his house to find a fan belt. Seems Wade was knocked out by the guys brother whilst the guy with the fan belt chased Carly around the town, eventually grabbing her and super gluing her lips shut whilst locking her in the cellar of his shop.\" He paused, looking at the others, shock clearly written all of over their faces, \"yeah, I know. Me and me friend finally arrived and started looking for them. The guy came out of the shop, said he didn't know anything about them but Carly, the brave girl, pulled her lips open in and screamed for help. I heard, knocked the guy out and rescued my sister.\" Nick smiled at his accomplishment before speaking again, \"this is where it gets disgusting.\" He looked at Sam and Amanda, both of them just seemed adamant to hear the rest, before carrying on, \"so me and Carly realize that the wax figures are actually real people trapped in wax in order for the figures to look more realistic. We overheard the two guys talking and, well, learnt that they had killed all our friends. Although, they did discover where we was and chased us to their House of Wax, which I unintentionally set on fire. The whole house is now melting but still the guy decides to fight me and Carly. She killed him with a baseball bat though so, yeah.\" He laughed slightly, \"his brother carried on chasing us up to the balcony. He decided to pick a fight as well, but he got stabbed in the hip and died. We ended up clawing our way out of the wax building as it collapsed and melted to the ground.\" His eyes glanced at the door again, making sure no one had walked in as he had been explaining. \"So, yeah. That's about it.\" The others stared at him with wide eyes, Sam looking as though she was going to be sick. Each one of them looking disturbed yet also upset. It wasn't something that was easy for people to take in, in fact James had been the first person that had seemed fine with it. Of course he wasn't. He just stayed strong for Carly. Leaning back Nick tapped his fingers on the table, his eyes fixed on his hand. \"That's just seriously wrong! What sort of people do that?\" Drew had spoken, holding Sam against him, trying to calm her down. They all glanced down, going into their own little worlds. Drew holding Sam, kissing the top of her head as she clutched onto his shirt; Amanda sat on her own, her body shaking slightly; and then there was Nick who just stared at the table, the events running through his mind. It was only the sound of the door opening that brought them back to reality. James and Carly continued to hug, holding each other until they had both calmed down. It was only when Carly had stopped crying that they stopped hugging, James taking hold of Carly's hand as they walked back round to the cafe, Carly leading the way and pushing the door open when they got there. \"Everything's fine. I'm fine.\" Carly spoke when she saw the others looking at her and James but it was clear in her voice that she wasn't fine. The memories that she had managed to push away for so long were on the surface again and they were going to haunt her for a long time, she could tell. She had to stay strong though, she had to keep a pokerface. Gently squeezing James' hand as they approached the table Carly smiled. James was smiling along with her but for a completely different reason. He knew this weekend was going to be good... Or so he thought. \"Well, if we're going camping then we best get some food and booze.\" Nick laughed after speaking, looking at the others for approval.

I hope you guys enjoy it! 😝 House of wax Nick listens to the song insanity as he lays in bed. It felt the house of wax was all just a fairy tale and it had never happened but it had. Nick and Carly had moved into a house together because of the house of wax. Nick moved Carly in because he didn't want to have her lose anther finger. It wasn't on his list of accomplishments to have her lose the first finger but if anther one was gone he would leave Carly alone forever. He thought that it'd be his fault and he'd probably kill himself without his twin sister. Suddenly hears Carly wake up from a nightmare and she cries out \"Nick!\". Nick jumps out of bed and runs to his twin/best friend only to find her with her hands over her face. Nick sits down at the end of her bed and says \"Carly...Please...Don't cry sis.\" Carly hugs Nick as she burst into tears. Carly lays her head on his shoulder. Nick rubs his sister's back and his parents walk in to see Carly asleep on the bed and Nick with a baseball bat in his hand. He had his back pressed to her bed and he was asleep. shakes his head and pulls the baseball bat out of his son's hands. Nick suddenly wakes up and screams \"Bo you mother f*cker! Don't you touch her!\" He punches his father in the throught and Carly rolls over still asleep. \"Nick!\" His mother snaps as she picks her husband up off of the floor. \"What are you doing here mom!?\" Nick snaps back. \"What are you don't here!?\" Their parents snap back. Nick says \"After the Ambrose I moved in with Carly to protect her. That first finger lost wasn't on my list of accomplishments and the car I stole it was for Carly. Got any more dumb a*s things to say!?\" Nick snaps. His parents look at each other and then look at the sleeping Carly. Carly's hand clasps on Nick's shoulder. Nick whispers \"I sit here nearly every night. I check on Carly and I'm more I've a man than my father has ever been and I'm a better guardian for her. When's she in trouble I don't call the police. I protect her and she protects me. She saved my life! I owe her.

Blake has been so excited that he wants to take us along with him. This is Winter Break of our senior year for cry aloud. I was sitting with Carly with Paige at table eating some fires with a coke. \"Here's one in Tribeca for 3000.\" Carly looked a little upset. \"That's still too much! Not all the money I have saved up will not even cover two months' rent I'm gonna have to work every second I'm not in class.\" \"Well don't even think about going.\" I said. Carly said \"I not.\" Paige said \"Good, because we're proud of you.\" \"It's just an internship.\" \"For instyle magazine or would rather stay at the waffle house as a waiters forever?\" \"No thank you.\" We all laughed. \"Hey Babe\" said Wade \"Hi\" said Carly. \"Sorry there were these two drunk reds necks wrestling in the bathrooms.\" \"There are no red necks in New York.\" Said Paige. Then there became an awkward silence. \"I'm going to see what Blake is doing, seeing is that that he likes that car more than me.\" Carly looked at me and giving me the signal to leave. \"I'm going to go to see what Nick and Dalton are doing.\" You see, I have been dating Nick for two years, but I have known him and his sister all my life. He can be a complete jerk sometimes but also a softy even though he never shows it. I walk into the store and saw Nick and Dalton. \"Hey guys.\" They got quiet and looked at me. \"What's going on?\" Nick said \"Nothing babe, come here.\" I walked over to nick and laid in his arms with my back to him. He kisses me forehead. \"Yea, nothing going on Peyton.\" Said Dalton. \"Ok, whatever you say Dalton, let's get out of here.\" I grab nicks hand and we walked out of the store. When we walked out of the store, we saw a homeless man sitting on the ground. Nick kicked his cupped and said, \"Get a job\" I said \"NICK!\" All he did shrugged and went to sit down. I gave the person some money and he said \"Thanks miss\" I smiled and went too sent down. I sat in front of nick and leaned against him. He put an arm around my waist and had a beer in the other. Wade thanks it is going to be a pretty good game and nick and Dalton had to mock him. \"Dalton please don't film me.\" Dalton said \"what I'm not filming you.\" Carly said \"The red light is on.\" Nick leaned over me and said, \"Put the camera down man, you know she doesn't like people all up in her face, she falls under pressure.\" Carly said, \"You got something to say to me nick?\" Nick said \"No, no I think you spoke enough for the both use don't you think?\" \"You guys are lames I'm out of here.\" Said Dalton as he took some fries and left. I grab nicks hand and said \"Come on I want to talk to you.\" Nick nodded and followed me. I pulled nick off to the side so we could talk. Nick said, \"What do want to talk about?\" I said, \"I just want you to promise me that you will behave on this trip for me.\" Nick said, \"I'll try.\" I said, \"Thank you, that's all I ask for.\" Nick smiled and leaned to kiss me. I smiled and stand on my tiptoes to kiss him. His lips were so soft against mine it felt like I was in heaven. He pulled me tighter to me. As he moved hands lower down my body. Blake coming over and telling use it was time to go interrupted us. We both groaned and nick said \"We will finish this later.\" I smiled and we walked to wade small car. This is going to be a long ride.[Chapter 2] We were wade cramp car; I was leaning on nick bored out my mind. Wade turned up the radio a little and said, \"It's going to be pack tomorrow.\" Dalton said, \"Dude, speaking of pack, my legs is killing me back here man.\" I was not complaining at all, it was not our fault that wades has a two-door car. Nevertheless, knowing nick had to make some joke about it. Nick said, \"Don't worry man, it's not wade fault, he's little hot wheels car only fit two.\" Then Dalton starts to laughs and makes jokes about wade haircut but I was not really paying it a mind. I started to doze off a little but I heard \"So much for a nice little shortcut.\" Nick looked down at me and said, \"You tired?\" I said, \"You have no idea.\" Wade said, \"I hope he doesn't get use lost.\" Carly said, \"Yea right.\" I felt someone tap my shoulder telling me to look over. I turned my head and my eyes were wide with surprise. It looks like Paige was giving pleasure to Blake. \"Oh my god.\" Said carly. We were laughing. Nick leaned over and honks the horn, scaring the daylights out of Paige. However, Blake looks liked yea right enjoying facing on. \"You are so busted\" said carly. Then carly said, \"She said she drop her lip bum.\" Everyone said, \"Yea right.\" We decided to stop for tonight and leave in the morning. Wade said, \"Hey a Wax Museum.\" Nick said, \"You like that kind of stuff wade?\" I wanted to hit nick but I too tired to move my body. Wade said, \"Yea I don't know sometimes.\" I too tried to listen to their conversation I just feel asleep. I felt someone shaking me lighting. I opened my eyes and saw it was nick. Nick said, \"Come on.\" He helps out of the car. I kiss him on the cheek and say thanks. Carly said \"Peyton can you come over?\" I nodded my head and walk over to her and Paige. \"Did you tell him?\" said carly. \"Course she didn't tell him, if she did, would we all be here right now?\" Paige said, \"I couldn't, there is no point of freaking him out right now.\" Carly said, \"What if found that you are pregnant.\" Paige said, \"I'm not sure ok.\" \"I just think you should have a conversation with him.\" Paige said, \"He's been looking forward to this stupid football game for months by starting a fight.\" Carly said \"He's not going to marry you, he's parents won't let him.\" \"Who says I want to get marry, besides I been late before, when I know foreshore I will talk to him ok.\" I said, \"Good, now let's go.\" I sitting with girls on a blanket, I look up and see nick sitting away from everyone else. Dalton said, \"You don't have to help use.\" Then the guys started to play football. \"Touchdown…...\" The ball lands rights by nick foot. I looked just in time to see nick throw the ball a Blake a little too hard. Wade said \"Nice arm, I can see why they gave you that scholarship.\" I looked carly and looked me. We both nodded our heads and were went to over to nick and wade. We tried to separate them. Carly said \"Wade, help Dalton ok.\" I said, \"Nick, please behave.\" Nick said \"Bye wade, asshole. \"Nick!\" I said slapping his shoulder. I took a sit in nick chair and listen to carly and nick argues. Carly said, \"You know what, you can be a prick to me that's fine, but he didn't do anything to you.\" They just kept going back forth, until I zoned out. I zoned backed I when I heard \"Don't you get, you're the good twin and I'm the evil one.\" Then carly told nick that he does not take things seriously, does he takes this relationship seriously? Then he started taking all hillbillies. I look at carly, the hurt on the face, look she was about to cry. She walks away saying \"Ok.\" Nick turned and looked at me. I looked him and shook my head. Nick said, \"You mad at me Peyton?\" I got up and said, \"You could be a jerk sometimes and you need to cool it, but you're my jerk.\" Nick smiled and kisses my forehead. We were having our moment when a smelly breeze came through. I buried face in nick chest; nick buried his face in my blonde hair. Blake said \"What's that's smell?\" Nick said, \"Dalton did you crap in your pants again?\" I laughed. Dalton said, \"I don't, I wearing my work clothes. \"Something dead out there.\" Said wade looking in the woods with a flashlight. Nick and I were in our own little world away from the others. Blake said, \"So why did you still that car anyway, you didn't need to do it, you need to get that rush, huh?\" Nick said \"Something like that.\" Carly said, \"You're coming out.\" Dalton said, I don't know.\" Carly said, if don't I'm going to be so mad.\" \"Damn Paige.\" Dalton mumbles. I looked up and started laughing. Blake said, \"You look like Elton john but more gay.\" Dalton said, \"Elton john is gay?\" Everyone started laughing. Soon everyone started to making out. I felt nick turn me around so I was facing him. We started to lean for a kiss.

A/n : Cerita ini terinspirasi dari sebuah komik yang saya baca. Entah judulnya apa, saya lupa XD =Enjoy= Akhir pekan biasanya dipakai oleh beberapa keluarga untuk bersenang-senang. Entah itu liburan ke tempat wisata atau hanya berdiam diri dirumah. Akhir pekan selalu menjadi hari terbaik untuk berkumpul bersama keluarga. Tapi kali ini tidak. Di kediaman keluarga Min sedang terjadi perang dingin antara sang kepala keluarga dengan anak sulungnya. Sesekali si anak sulung melempar tatapan tidak suka pada sang ayah. Tapi sang ayah hanya menanggapinya biasa. \"Aku menolak,\" ujar si anak sulung ketus. Terdengar tidak sopan memang, tapi untuk masalah ini si sulung berhak mempertahankan pendapatnya. \"Kau tidak bisa menolak, Yoongi- ah \", sambung si ayah. \"Aku tidak mau tahu ayah, aku menolak dijodohkan. Aku tidak mau, \" si sulung yang bernama Min Yoongi itu tetap pada pendiriannya. Lagi pula menurutnya di era modern seperti ini sudah tidak zaman yang namanya perjodohan. \"Kau sudah cukup umur Yoongi- ah . Lagi pula apa yang salah? Kau suka lelaki, kan? Ayah sudah cukup baik menjodohkanmu dengan lelaki pilihan ayah, \" ujar sang kepala keluarga santai sambil sesekali menyeruput kopi buatan isterinya. \"Tapi tetap saja aku menolak. Aku ingin lelaki pilihanku sendiri, bukan pilihan ayah, \" ucap Yoongi bersikeras. \"Kenapa tidak Jungkook saja yang ayah jodohkan? \" sambungnya. \"Hei, adikmu masih harus fokus kuliah, \" ujar sang ayah membuat Min Jungkook yang sedang duduk disampingnya tersenyum senang. \"Jangan membantah! Besok ikut ayah mengunjungi calon pasanganmu! \" perintah ayah mutlak. Yoongi terdiam ditempat. Ayahnya ini benar-benar tidak bisa dibantah. Satu-satunya orang yang bisa membantah ayah hanya ibu. Yoongi pun menoleh menatap ibunya, berharap sang ibu mau membantunya kali ini. Tapi saat melihat sang ibu yang menggeleng kecil membuat Yoongi paham. Keputusan ini tidak bisa dibantah. Mau tidak mau Yoongi harus bertemu dengan calon pasangannya. Entah nanti Yoongi menyukainya atau tidak, itu urusan belakangan. Di dalam mobil, Yoongi masih saja menekuk wajahnya sebal membuat sang adik mengolok-oloknya sambil tertawa terbahak-bahak. \" Hyung , wajahmu rapikan. Masa mau bertemu calon wajahnya berantakan gitu, \" ucap adiknya asal menyebabkan pukulan telak Yoongi yang menghantam bahunya. \"Hey Kookie- ah , jangan ganggu hyung mu! \" perintah sang ibu lembut. Jungkook hanya terkekeh senang menanggapinya. Menggoda hyungnya selalu menjadi hobi terbaik baginya. \"Yoongi- ah , ingat apa yang harus kau ucapkan jika ayah calonmu bertanya tentangmu?\" tanya sang ayah sambil tetap fokus mengemudi. Jalanan malam ini cukup ramai, membuat sang ayah harus ekstra berkonsentrasi jika tidak ingin mobil mulusnya menubruk sesuatu. \"Jika bertanya tentangku, aku hanya tinggal bilang 'Saya Min Yoongi, putra sulung keluarga Min. Usia duapuluh tujuh tahun dan siap dijodohkan dengan putra anda' begitu, \" ujar Yoongi malas. Sang ayah tersenyum bangga, \"benar. Kau pintar sekali. Itu jawaban yang bagus, \" puji sang ayah. Sekitar empat puluh lima menit mereka semua dalam perjalanan, akhirnya sampailah disebuah rumah sederhana yang terlihat sangat nyaman. Halamannya sangat terawat dengan berbagai macam tanaman menghiasi. Lampu-lampu kecil juga turut memperindah suasana halaman rumah itu. \"Selamat malam, Tuan dan Nyonya Min, \" sapa seorang wanita paruh baya saat mereka semua sampai di pintu utama. \"Saya asisten rumah tangga di sini. Silakan masuk, Tuan dan Nyonya Park sudah menunggu di ruang keluarga, \" katanya sambil mempersilakan mereka semua untuk sampai di ruang keluarga. \"Tuan, Nyonya, keluarga Min sudah datang, \" ujar sang asisten rumah tangga itu. Mendengar itu, sang pemilik rumah pun bergegas menghampiri tamunya. Cukup lama Yoongi menunggu sang ayah dan ibu yang sedang berbincang-bincang dengan orang tua si calon. Sampai akhirnya, ayah si calon memintanya untuk memperkenalkan diri. \"Halo Tuan dan Nyonya Park. Saya Min Yoongi, putra sulung keluarga Min. Saya berusia duapuluh tujuh tahun dan saya siap untuk dijodohkan dengan putra tersayang anda, \" ujar Yoongi lancar jaya membuat sang ayah tersenyum lebar tanda bangga. Sang ayah tidak tahu saja apa yang Yoongi rasakan disini. Ingatlah Yoongi masih menentang perjodohan ini dalam hatinya. Walaupun berontak pun tak ada gunanya. \"Waahh... Min Yoongi anak yang sopan. Ia juga tampan. Sepertinya cocok dengan putra kami, \" ujar Nyonya Park. \"Sebentar ya, saya keatas untuk memanggil putra saya, \" sambungnya lalu bergegas naik tangga menuju lantai dua. Yoongi pun hanya bisa menunggu dengan gelisah. Bagaimana jika ternyata putra keluarga Park ini tidak masuk dalam kategori pasangan ideal menurut Yoongi? Bagaimana jika pasangannya ini ternyata gendut, hitam, cengeng, dan bersifat seperti adiknya? Waahhh... Sudah dipastikan Yoongi akan berontak dan berlalu meninggalkan rumah itu. \"Itu anak saya, \" tunjuk Tuan Park pada sang anak yang berada di puncak tangga. \"Kemari sayang, \" panggil ayahnya. Yoongi menoleh malas untuk melihat sang calon pasangan. Dalam hati ia berdoa agar calonnya cantik dan masuk dalam kategori pasangan ideal. Awalnya Yoongi menatap biasa kearah puncak tangga. Tapi sedetik kemudian, matanya membola. Yoongi terkejut ketika melihat sang calon pasangannya yang begitu cantik, imut dan anggun. Tapi keterkejutannya hilang saat ia melihat sesuatu yang janggal. Yoongi langsung saja berbisik pada ayahnya, \"ayah... Ayah bilang calonku lelaki, \" ujar Yoongi pelan. \"Memang lelaki, \" tambah ayahnya membuat Yoongi mengerutkan dahi bingung. \"Tapi ituuuu, \" Yoongi dan sang ayah kompak melihat kearah si calon. Tepatnya kearah dadanya yang terlihat besar seperti wanita. Sedetik kemudian, Yoongi dan ayahnya menghela napas malas. Ini sih wanita sungguhan. Yoongi menatap ayahnya dengan pandangan 'ayah ayo pulang. Aku ingin calon lelaki'. Intinya begitulah makna pandangan Yoongi. \"Maaf sebelumnya, tapi bukankah sebelumnya anda bilang calonnya lelaki?\" tanya sang ayah sopan. Tuan Park pun sontak melihat kearah anaknya yang sudah duduk disampingnya. Samar-samar Yoongi mendengar apa yang mereka bicarakan. \"Apa kau tadi mandi air dingin?\" bisik Tuan Park yang dijawab anggukan oleh anaknya. \"Yak! Pergi ke kamar. Mandi air hangat! Buat dirimu kembali menjadi lelaki!\" perintah Tuan Park. Yoongi yang mendengarnya bingung sendiri. Apa maksudnya 'buat dirimu kembali menjadi lelaki'? \"Selamat malam, saya Park Jimin. Putra tunggal keluarga Park, \" sapa si calon yang sekarang sudah berubah menjadi lelaki sungguhan. Area dadanya tiba-tiba saja rata, tidak seperti awal tadi. Ayah, Ibu, Yoongi dan Jungkook sukses tercengang. Mereka semua yakin apa yang dilihatnya tadi adalah seorang perempuan. Tapi limabelas menit kemudian, sosok perempuan tadi berubah menjadi laki-laki sungguhan. \"Maafkan kejadian tadi, sebenarnya anak kami telah mengalami suatu kejadian besar yang menyebabkan dirinya bisa berubah jadi wanita, \" ujar Nyonya Park menjelaskan. Yoongi tak habis pikir. Semengerikan apa kejadian itu sampai bisa merubah gender seseorang? \"Bisa diceritakan kejadiannya?\" pinta sang ibu ramah. \"Sekitar lima bulan yang lalu, kami semua berwisata ke sebuah gunung yang ada dipedalaman. Kami semua sangat senang saat itu. Kami semua berjalan mendaki gunung dengan semangat. Setelah berjam-jam berjalan, kami memutuskan untuk beristirahat di dalam gua. Karena Jimin tipe orang yang bersemangat, ia izin untuk memasuki gua itu lebih dalam. Entah bagaimana ceritanya, saat keluar gua Jimin sudah berubah jadi perempuan, \" cerita Nyonya Park membuat seluruh keluarga Min membulatkan mata tak percaya. Waahh... Gua itu ajaib sekali. \"Apa yang dilakukan oleh Jimin?\" ayah mulai bertanya. \"Di dalam gua, aku menemukan sebuah kubangan. Air dalam kubangan itu sungguh jernih. Awalnya aku hanya ingin membasuh tanganku disana, tetapi saat aku melangkah, ada sebuah batu besar didepanku yang membuat aku tersandung dan tercebur ke dalam kubangan itu, \" jelas Jimin dengan suara lembutnya. \"Seorang juru kunci berkata, sekitar dua ratus tahun yang lalu, ada seorang gadis yang juga tercebur kesana. Jadi saat aku tercebur, aku berubah menjadi seorang gadis, \" sambungnya. Yoongi lebih tak percaya. Tempat kuno apa yang mereka datangi? \"Apa bisa disembuhkan?\" kali ini Yoongi yang bertanya. Tuan dan Nyonya Park menggeleng. \"Kami sudah berusaha mencari pengobatan alternatif untuk Jimin. Tapi hasilnya nihil. Jimin tidak bisa disembuhkan. \" \"Cara mengubah Jimin jadi perempuan itu seperti apa? \" tanya ayah penasaran. \"Jimin akan berubah jadi perempuan saat terkena air dingin, lalu berubah lagi menjadi laki-laki saat tubuhnya diguyur air hangat. \" Ucapan Nyonya Park barusan sukses membuat Yoongi menghela napas berat. Apakah ia benar-benar akan dijodohkan dengan pria... Bukan... Wanita... Ahhh bukan. Intinya seseorang seperti Jimin? Setelah berbincang banyak, para orangtua memutuskan untuk membiarkan Yoongi dan Jimin untuk berbincang berdua. Biar mereka berdua yang memutuskan, ingin dilanjut atau tidak perjodohan ini. Jimin membawa Yoongi duduk dikursi yang ada dihalaman. Suasananya canggung, tidak ada satupun dari mereka yang memulai topik pembicaraan. Hening cukup lama, sampai akhirnya Yoongi bersuara karena melihat Jimin yang menggosok-gosokan kedua telapak tangannya kedinginan. \"Dingin?\" tanya Yoongi singkat. Jimin menoleh kesamping, lalu mengangguk kecil. \"Hhmmm... Sedikit, \" ujarnya. Yoongi pun melepas jaket yang ia kenakan, lalu menyampirkannya dibahu kecil milik Jimin. \"Pakailah, \" katanya lembut. \"Tapi nanti Yoongi- ssi juga kedinginan. Jiminie tak apa, \" ujar Jimin tak enak hati dan bersiap melepas jaket milik Yoongi. Tapi tidak jadi saat tangan Yoongi menahan pergerakannya. \"Pakai saja. Dan juga, jangan terlalu formal kepadaku. Panggil aku... Hyung , \" ujar Yoongi ragu. Tadinya Yoongi akan menyuruhnya memanggil oppa , tapi berhubung sekarang Jimin jadi laki-laki yaaa panggil saja hyung . Jimin meremat erat jaket milik Yoongi. Dadanya berdegup kencang entah mengapa. \"Gomawo hyung , \" Jimin berujar sambil menampilkan senyum terbaiknya. ' Manis ', batin Yoongi. \" Hyung , masalah perjodohan... Apa kita akan melanjutkannya?\" tanya Jimin pelan. Sesekali kepalanya mendongak untuk melihat ribuan bintang yang bersinar terang. \"Menurutmu? \" Yoongi balik bertanya. Jimin menundukkan wajahnya, \"Jiminie ingin melanjutkan, tapi jika Yoongi hyung keberatan karena kondisi Jiminie tak apa-apa. Jiminie akan terima semua keputusan Yoongi hyung , \" ujarnya setengah bersedih. Yoongi yang melihatnya bersedih sedikit merasa tak tega. Bagaimanapun juga Park Jimin termasuk dalam kategori pasangan ideal menurut Jimin. Wajahnya yang cantik dan imut, serta tingkahnya yang anggun benar-benar tipe Min Yoongi sekali. \"Aku juga ingin melanjutkan, tapi yaaaa... \" ujar Yoongi menggantung. \"Karena kondisi Jiminie yaa, \" ujar Jimin yang dibalas anggukkan kecil dari Yoongi. Jimin menunduk bersedih. Padahal susah sekali mencari pasangan diusia Jimin yang sudah menginjak duapuluh lima tahun. \"Hei jangan bersedih, kita tetap akan lanjutkan perjodohan ini, \" hibur Yoongi sambil mengusak kepala Jimin pelan. \" Hyung menerima Jiminie jadi pasangan hyung ? \" tanyanya girang. Yoongi mengangguk menanggapinya, \"yaaa meskipun aku masih ragu, tapi bisa kan kau membantu menghilangkan keraguanku?\" ucap Yoongi lembut. Jimin tersenyum, matanya menyipit lucu saat senyumannya semakin lebar. Membuat Yoongi mencubit pelan pipinya karena gemas. \"Jiminie akan membantu sebisa Jiminie. Terimakasih sudah menerima Jiminie apa adanya, \" ujarnya tulus. Yoongi hanya tersenyum gemas melihat tingkah lucu Jimin. \"Mengapa kau lebih suka lelaki daripada perempuan? \" tanya Yoongi. Dengan berani, Yoongi menarik pelan tubuh Jimin agar lebih dekat dengannya. Tangannya juga menggapai kepala Jimin untuk ia sandarkan di bahunya. \"Dulu, teman Jiminie sering bertengkar dengan kekasihnya. Dia bilang bahwa perempuan itu merepotkan, \" ujarnya jujur. Pipi yang semula terasa dingin itu sekarang menghangat karena merasakan usapan lembut tangan Yoongi di kepalanya. \"Kalau hyung ? Lebih suka Jiminie yang laki-laki atau perempuan? \" tanyanya sedikit mendongak. \"Aku tidak suka perempuan, kecuali ibuku, \" jawab Yoongi. \"Aku lebih suka kau lelaki, \" sambungnya lagi. \"Kalau begitu jangan biarkan Jiminie terkena air dingin hyung . Yoongi hyung harus menjaga Jiminie, \" katanya lembut sambil menyamankan dirinya dibahu Yoongi. Yoongi menangguk menanggapi, \"hhmmm... Kupastikan kau selalu menjadi lelaki, \" Yoongi menyandarkan pipinya dikepala Jimin. Tangannya meraih tangan mungil Jimin dan mengecupnya dalam. Tidak peduli bagaimana kondisi Jimin, tidak peduli keadaan fisik Jimin. Yoongi hanya ingin Jimin jadi pasangannya. Yoongi berterimakasih pada ayahnya yang sudah menjodohkannya dengan Park Jimin. Yaa meskipun awalnya keberatan, tapi jika disuguhi lelaki macam Jimin mana bisa Yoongi menolak. Jangan memilih pasangan hanya karena kondisi atau merasa kasihan, pilihlah pasanganmu sebagaimana hatimu berkata. Yoongi telah melakukannya. Ia telah memilih Jimin sebagaimana hatinya berteriak menginginkan Park Jimin jadi pasangannya. =The End= ","Summary":" MAN OR WOMAN [YOONMIN] @KodokSupreme Genre : Romance Summary : Kejadian membingungkan ketika calon "},{"Movie":"Romantics","Title":"Late Night","Author":"fbxxbr27","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13153330","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hari ini, hujan sedang mengguyur malam yang damai. Kaca jendela pun juga mengeluarkan bunyi akibat terpaan tetesan air hujan. \"Hyung, ayo kita tidur.\" Hyungwon segera mematikan ponselnya dan beranjak ke kasur. Orang yang diajaknya -Wonho, masih terfokus oleh laptopnya. Sudah beberapa jam Wonho tidak beranjak dari meja-nya. \"Tidurlah duluan. Aku masih harus menyelesaikan ini.\" Wonho segera menggaruk kepalanya gusar dan meneguk kopi yang dibuat Hyungwon beberapa menit yang lalu. \"Ayolah hyung, ini hampir larut malam. Besok kita ada kegiatan bukan?\" Hyungwon terbangun dan duduk di kasurnya melihat bahu lebar tersebut terfokus hanya pada laptopnya - dan sejujurnya itu membuat Hyungwon kesal . \"Baiklah baiklah. Aku akan berhenti jika kau memberikan sesuatu yang menarik untukku.\" Wonho segera memutar kursi nya dan melihat Hyungwon yang terduduk di kasurnya. \"Sesuatu spesial seperti apa? aku tidak mengerti maksudmu hyung.\" Hyungwon menatap bingung Wonho yang beranjak dari kursinya dan menuju ke arah Hyungwon di kasurnya. \"Entahlah? sesuatu yang bisa membuatku tidak bergantung lagi pada laptop?\" Wonho menaikkan alisnya sebelah dan tersenyum seraya melipat kedua tangannya. Hyungwon mulai tahu apa yang diinginkan Wonho saat ini. Hyungwon segera menghela nafasnya panjang dan melambaikan tangannya menandakan Wonho untuk mendekat ke dirinya. Wonho yang tersenyum segera mendekatkan wajahnya ke arah Hyungwon. Dan tak lama kemudian, bibir Hyungwon segera mengecup sesaat bibir tebal berbau kafein tersebut. Tidak ada sampai sedetik Hyungwon segera melepaskannya dan menatap Wonho kesal dan malu. Wonho tertawa pelan dan mengusap bibir Hyungwon. \"Maafkan aku, tapi aku ingin lebih. Aku harus bagaimana dong?\" Wonho duduk di tepi kasur bersebelahan persis dengan Hyungwon. \"Tidak! Tidak ada begituan malam ini!\" Hyungwon segera tidur dan menutup dirinya dengan selimutnya. Wonho pun tertawa dan membuka selimut Hyungwon. \"Begituan apanya? kamu pingin? aku tidak berfikir sampai segitunya loh?\" Wonho kembali menggoda Hyungwon yang mencoba mengatasi maluya. Woho masih saja mencoba membuka selimut Hyungwon. \"Ah hyung! Cepatlah tidur!\" Hyungwon mulai kesal dan menarik paksa selimut yang Wonho coba singkirkan dari Hyungwon. Wonho beranjak dan segera mematikan laptopnya dan menggosok giginya. Hyungwon membuka sedikit selimutnya dan mencari keberadaan Wonho. \" Hyung? \" Hyungwon segera membuka perlahan selimutnya. Tiba-tiba suara pintu kamar mandi terbuka yang dapat Hyungwon dengar, segera menampilkan Wonho yang telah siap dengan pakaian tidurnya. Hyungwon hanya melihat Wonho dengan tatapan malu. \"Sekarang kau sudah mendapatkan apa yang kamu inginkan. Sekarang giliranku.\" Wonho segera tidur di kasur bersebelahan dengan Hyungwon. Hyungwon hanya melihat Wonho kesal. \"Baiklah! Sekarang apa yang hyung inginkan?\" Hyungwon akhirnya mempersilahkan lelaki kekar tersebut mengutarakan apa yang ia inginkan. \"Aku hanya ingin sebuah ciuman\" Wonho segera membenarkan bantalnya dan mendekatkan bibir nya tanpa aba-aba ke arah bibir Hyungwon. Karena dirasa terlalu mendadak, Hyungwon menahan bahu lebar tersebut untuk mencium dirinya. \"Hyung, janji hanya ciuman\" Hyungwon menatap Wonho kesal dan menggigit bibir bawahnya malu. Wonho berfikir sejenak dan menyunggingkan senyuman liciknya. \"Hm, aku tidak bisa menjaminnya.\" Karena tak ingin menunggu terlalu lama, Wonho segera membuka paksa mulut Hyungwon dengan bibirnya. Hyungwon hanya menutup matanya erat sambil menggenggam baju tidurnya erat. Wonho yang benar-benar tidak main-main, perlahan membuka kancing piyama Hyungwon. Hyungwon yang mengetahuinya mencoba menahan tangan Wonho untuk berbuat lebih dari yang ia pikirkan. \"Hngm.. W-wonho hyung... J-Jangan! \" Hyungwon menahan tangan kekar tersebut yang mencoba memainkan tubuhnya. Wonho hanya tersenyum licik dan menjilat daun telinga Hyungwon dan mulai mengelus pelan bidang datar Hyungwon. \" A-ah.. H-hyung! \" suar Hyungwon mulai serak dan lelah menahan tangan Wonho yang mulai jahil. Setelah asyik menggoda Hyungwon dari daun telinga nya yang sensitif, mulut Wonho kembali bercumbu dengan Hyungwon sehingga menghasilkan bunyi yang cukup erotis. \" H-hmngh...Mwon-hwo-... \" Hyungwon mencoba menghentikan Wonho karena Hyungwon mulai kehilangan pasokan oksigen. Wonho yang mengetahui nya segera melepas cumbuan-nya dan menghasilkan benang saliva yang terhubung antara dirinya dan Hyungwon. Hyungwon segera menarik nafas cepat agar ia bisa bernafas secara normal kembali. Wonho segera mendekatkan mulutnya ke arah leher Hyungwon dan mulai memainkan nipple Hyungwon pelan. \" H-hyung! H-hanya ciuman-akh! \" Hyungwon menggenggam erat pergelangan Wonho untuk melampiaskan rasa geli kenikmatannya atas perlakuan Wonho. \"Aku tidak akan memasukkannya ke tubuhmu. Hanya ingin bermain-main saja.\" Wonho tersenyum dan mengecup pelan dahi Hyungwon. \"Pembohong-\" \"Diam atau aku benar-benar melakukannya\" Wonho kini juga ikut kesal dengan perkataan Hyungwon. Wonho segera menggigit dan menghisap gemas leher Hyungwon sedikit lama sehingga sang empu menggigit bibir bawahnya dengan keras menahan desahannya. Sebuah tanda memar merah keunguan terlihat jelas di leher Hyungwon saat ini. \"Ah hyung! Kau membuatnya terlalu jelas! Bagaimana jika member lain mengetahuinya?!\" Hyungwon mulai berbicara dengan nada kesal pada Wonho. Wonho hanya tertawa pelan dan memeluk Hyungwon. \"Maaf maaf! Cukup pakai sweater turtle neck milikku saja.\" Wonho mengecup sesaat Hyungwon dan kembali ke collarbone Hyungwon yang terlihat menggoda. Wonho segera menjilat sensual sehingga Hyungwon terkejut. \"Hyung! jangan membuat- Akhh... \" Hyungwon meringis keras saat gigi-gigi kuat tersebut mulai menggigit dengan jangk waktu yang cukup lama di collarbone -nya. Dan berterima kasihlah pada Wonho. Kini terdapat dua lebam baru pada leher dan juga bagian yang tak jauh dari leher milik Hyungwon. Wonho segera memeluk Hyungwon dan mengelus pelan punggungnya. \"Maaf maaf! Bagaimana jika kita tidur saja?\" Wonho tetap mencoba mengelus dan menenangkan Hyungwon agar Hyunhwon diam. Hyungwon mengangguk pelan dan menenggelamkan kepalanya ke dada Wonho dan membalas pelukan Wonho. \"Maafkan aku ya?\" Wonho melirik kebawah untuk melihat Hyungwon sesaat sebelum dirinya tidur. Dilihatnya Hyungwon mengangguk sangat pelan dan kedua matanya tertutup dengan damai. \"Selamat tidur Hyungwon\" Wonho mengecup pelan kepala Hyungwon dan memeluk Hyungwon lebih erat lagi.

Third P.O.V Virgil groaned as Patton dragged him out of his room. It was their weekly Disney movie night. There was only one spot left for Virgil, next to Roman. Now, Virgil gets really really anxious when it comes to being beside Roman. Young love they say (Lmao what). He sat down next to him as Patton put the DVD in. Roman almost jumped when he saw the title \"Aladdin\" come up. Aladdin was his favorite. Virgil laughed at his reaction. \"Jeez Roman. I didn't know you were the monkey from this movie. He likes to jump a lot.\". Virgil said as he giggled. \"Oh shut up, emo nightmare!\" shouted Roman. \"Roman, Virgil. Quiet down please. Patton wants a movie night without any of you love birds fighting.\" Said Logan as he placed his hand over Patton's mouth to muffle his squealing. Virgil's face turned bright red as he covered his face. Roman just continued to watch. It was almost the ending of the movie. Patton and Logan fell asleep hugging each other. After all, it was around 11 in the night. Virgil and Roman were the only ones awake at the time. As the movie ended, Virgil got up and went to the kitchen to get a snack before retreating to his room. He jumped as he turned around seeing Roman behind him. \"O-oh, Hi Ro.\" Virgil said as he got a chocolate bar from the drawer. \"Virgil…I have to tell you something.\" Roman said as he walked towards Virgil. \"Uhm..sure. What is it?\" Virgil said. Roman put his hand around Virgil's waist and brought him closer. \"R-Roman?! U-uhm..w-what are you do-\" Roman then cut him off with a kiss. It took him a few seconds to remember to kiss back. Virgil's hand on Roman's hair, Virgil's other hand at the back of Roman's neck, Roman's hands on Virgil's waist. After 30 seconds or so, Virgil pushed Roman back to gasp for air. Roman, slightly surprised, \"Oh my.. Sorry Virgil! I don't know what got to me!\" \"R-roman..It's fine..that was kinda nice..\" Virgil said as he hid his bright red face. \"By the way, save what what you have to tell me tonight. I wanna sleep now. Goodnight Roman.\" Virgil said walking towards him. \"Goodnight Virge\" Roman said as Virgil gives him a kiss on the cheek. Virgil ran upstairs while Roman stood in the kitchen still trying to process what just happened. It was a crazy night for them both. Roman woke up on the couch with Virgil watching some videos on youtube next to him. \"Oh Good Morning Roman!!!\" Patton said as he walked to him with a tray of pancakes. Roman took the tray and began to eat. \"This thastes aweshome Patthon!\" Roman said with his mouth full. \"Don't eat with your mouth full, Roman.\" Logan said as he took a seat near Virgil. Patton looked at Virgil and Roman with such puppy eyes. \"Yes Patton?\" Virgil said looking up from his phone. Roman just finished his breakfast and eager to hear what Patton wants to say. \"Kiddos, how was the kiss?\" Patton said as he starts squealing. Logan starts laughing as Virgil and Roman look at each other and Patton in shock. \"H-HOW DID YOU KNOW?\" Virgil questioned as he covers his bright red face. \"We hid a camera in the kitchen.\" Logan said as Roman starts hugging a pillow tightly. \"I m-mean it wasn't that bad..\" Roman's muffled voice said. Virgil puts the hood over his head as Patton starts squealing even more. \"ADMIT IT!!! YOU LOVE EACH OTHERRRRRRR!!!!!!\" Patton squealed as Logan starts to calm him down. \"In fact though, you have to open up to each other.\" Logan said as he muffles Patton's screams and squeals. Roman stands up and extends a hand towards Virgil. Virgil holds his hand and stands up. \"Virgil, will you be my boyfriend?\" Roman stated as Patton starts recording and Logan starts to remove his hand from Patton's mouth. \"Gladly\" Virgil said as Roman brings him in for another kiss.

Seperti saat ini sehun pulang dari kegiatan syutingnya pada tengah malam dengan wajah yang kelihatan sangat lelah sekali. Sehun berjalan menuju kamarnya dengan sempoyongan akibat rasa kantuk kini tengah ia rasakan. Ceklek Pintu kamar dengan nuansa dominan putih ini terbuka membuat orang yang berada di dalam langsung menolehkan kepalanya kearah pintu yang tengah terbuka lebar. \"kau baru pulang sayang?\" tanya chanyeol ketika melihat sehun memasuki kamar mereka. \"hm\" \"kau belum tidur hyung?\" tanya sehun saat melihat chanyeol yang masih duduk menyandarkan punggungnya di dinding dan masih membaca buku yang akhir akhir ini menjadi favoritnya itu. \"hm, aku belum mengantuk\" ucap chanyeol, jelas saja ia tidak mengatakan yang sesungguhnya kepada sehun bahwa sedari tadi ia sengaja menahan rasa kantuknya agar dapat bertemu dengan sehun mengingat akhir akhir ini mereka jadi sulit untuk bertemu bahkan untuk saling berbicara. \"kau mau mandi? Biar aku siapkan air hangat untukmu\" \"tak usah hyung aku hanya ingin mencuci wajahku saja, aku terlalu lelah untuk sekedar mandi hyung\" \"hm ya sudah\" ucap chanyeol kini ia kembali fokus terhadap buku yang sedari tadi ia baca. Sehun mulai melepas semua pakaian yang ia kenakan dan mulai berjalan ke arah kamar mandi untuk mencuci wajahnya walaupun dengan terhuyung huyung saat tengah berjalan. Chanyeol sebenarnya sudah tidak lagi membaca bukunya semenjak sehun masuk ke kamar mereka, ia memperhatikan setiap gerak gerik sehun dari kejauhan. Seusai membersihkan wajah serta mengganti bajunya dengan piaya berwarna babby blue, sehun kini melangkah menuju chanyeol yang masih duduk memegangi bukunya. Sehun mulai merangkak mendekati chanyeol, sebenarnya chanyeol mengetahui apa yang sehun lakukan namun ia memilih berakting seolah tidak mengetahuinya. Sehun semakin merangkak naik ke atas tubuh chanyeol dan mulai menelusupkan wajahnya di dada bidang chanyeol, tak sampai disitu kini sehun memeluk pinggang chanyeol erat. Hingga membuat chanyeol mengalihkan atensinya pada buku yang ia bawa beralih ke sehun yang kini tengah memeluknya erat. Chanyeol mulai menutup bukunya dan menaruhnya di atas meja samping ranjang dan mulai menarik selimut untuk menutupi tubuhnya dan sehun. Chanyeol membaringkan tubuh sehun dengan perlahan agar tak mengganggu sehun, sedangkan sehun sendiri malah semakin mengeratkan pelukannya terhadap pinggang chanyeol. Kini mata sehun semakin terpejam karena rasa kantuk dan nyaman saat memeluk chanyeol. Chanyeol yang melihat sehun semakin mengeratkan pelukannya perlahan membalas pelukan kekasihnya itu serta sesekali ia usap pucuk kepala sehun yang membuat sehun semakin nyaman dan merasa mengantuk. \"hyung~\" \"hm\" Cup Sehun mencium sekilas bibir chanyeol, namun ketika ia hendak menarik dirinya ia kalah cepat dengan chanyeol yang kini menahan tengkuknya dan mulai memperdalam ciuman mereka. Chanyeol semakin gencar melumat, menghisap, menggigit serta mengajak perang lidah sehun hingga membuat sehun mendesah tertahan karenanya. \"aeungghhhh\" desah sehun saat chanyeol mulai menjilati bibirnya. \"enghhh\" \"eumhhhhh\" \"mhhhhh\" \"ahhh\" sehun terus mendesah saat lidah chanyeol mulai membelit lidahnya hingga lelehan saliva kini membanjiri sudut sudut bibirnya. Sehun yang mulai kehabisan nafas kini mulai memukul mukul dada bidang chanyeol, dengan tidak rela chanyeol melepaskan ciumannya. Hah Hah Hah Sehun mulai meraup udara sebanyak banyaknya hingga dadanya naik turun dengan cepat. Chanyeol mengusap sisa saliva yang mengalir dari bibir sehun hingga ke dagu sehun. Cup Chanyeol mengecup dahi sehun lama membuat sehun menutup matanya merasakan kelembutan dari sikap chanyeol. \"tidurlah kau pasti lelah\" ucap chanyeol yang di balas anggukan kecil sehun. Chanyeol kini menarik tubuh sehun agar semakin dekat dengannya, ia merengkuh tubuh kurus itu kedalam pelukan hangat yang selalu sehun sukai. Chanyeol kembali mengusap punggung sehun hingga sehun benar benar tertidur. Chanyeol memandangi wajah lelah sang kekasih mengusapnya perlahan dari mata sampai ke area favoritnya yaitu bibir. Cup Cup Cup Chanyeol mulai menciumi wajah sehun dengan perlahan agar tak membangunkan sehun yang baru saja terlelap. \"kenapa kau sekarang jadi kurus begini hunnie? Kantung matamu pun kini semakin jelas terlihat, apa kau tak makan dengan baik? Kenapa kau malah memutuskan mengambil pekerjaan itu di saat jadwal kita yang tengah padat seperti ini, kenapa kau tidak memperhatikan kondisi tubuhmu? Kenapa kau suka sekali membuatku khawatir\" ucap chanyeol masih dengan mengusap wajah sehun. Sehun sama sekali tak terganggu dengan kegiatan yang chanyeol lakukan pada wajahnya, ia terlalu lelah hingga membuatnya langsung jatuh tertidur. Cup Chanyeol kembali mencium kening dan bibir sehun sekilas. \"jangan sampai sakit sayang, hyung tidak mau melihatmu sakit, hyungg sangat mencintaimu\" Cup Setelah mengecup kembali bibir yang menjadi candunya itu, kini chanyeol menyamankan posisinya berbaring di sebelah sehun dan mulai menutup matanya menyusul sehun ke alam mimpi. Pagi hari ini entah mengapa sang surya enggan untuk keluar hingga langit hanya berhiaskan. Kini sehun mulai terusik tidurnya mendengar kicauan burung burung diluaran sana. Sehun menggeliatkan badannya yang terasa kaku, saat ia hendak beranjak dari tidurnya sebuah lengan kekar menghalanginya untuk bangun. Cup Chanyeol mengecup singkat bibir sehun. \"pagi\" sapanya dengan suara khas orang baru bangun tidur. Sehun tersenyum melihat wajah sang kekasihnya ini. \"pagi hyung\" \"kau mau berangkat syuting lagi hari ini?\" tanya chanyeol dengan mata yang masih setengah terpejam. \"iya hyung, kenapa?\" \"tidak aku hanya ingin memastikan sesibuk apapun jangan sampai telat makan dan rutinlah meminum vitaminmu karena cuaca yang sering berubah ubah serta pakai jaket tebalmu saat malam tiba\" ucap chanyeol yang sudah seperti seorang ibu yang tengah menasehati sang anak. \"baiklah aku akan melakukannya hyung\" \"kau mau mandi bersama?\" \"kelihatannya bukan ide yang buruk, kalau begitu ayo hyung\" \"tapi gendong\" ucap sehun manja yang sukses membuat chanyeol terkekeh karena tingkah sehun. Chanyeol kini berjalan dengan sehun yang berada di dalam gendongan ala koala. Mungkin hari ini akan sama seperti hari kemarin yang akan membuat sehun kelelahan namun kali ini ia mengawali hari dengan kemesraan yang ia jalin dengan chanyeol untuk sekedar mengobati rasa rindu serta sebagai energi untuk aktifitasnya nanti.

Kemeja satin dengan celana bahan menjadi pakaianku hari ini. Tak lupa aku menguraikan rambutku, agar penampilanku semakin sempurna. Akupun melirik jam dinding sekilas, 6.50 AM kst. Harusnya hari ini seokjin sudah mengabariku. Akhirnya aku berinisiatif untuk menghubunginya lewat aplikasi chat. 'Seokjin-ah.. kau akan berangkat ke kampus?' Read 06.51 am Tak lama setelah aku mengirim pesan tersebut. Ponselku berbunyi. Sepertinya Seokjin. Akupun dengan cepat melihat notifikasi itu. 'Maaf kook-ah, sepertinya hari ini aku tidak bisa berangkat bersamamu. Namjoon menjemputku. Sebagai gantinya adikku taehyung yang akan 'menjemputmu' \"Aish apa apaan dia itu. Seenaknya saja dia menyuruh adiknya untuk menjemputku. Aku kan tidak mengenal adiknya itu.\" Tanpa pikir panjang akupun dengan cepat mengetik balasan untuk seokjin 'Yak! Apa maksudmu menyuruh adikmu menjemputku?' Read 06.52 am 'cepatlah keluar. Adikku sebentar lagi akan sampai dan aku tidak menerima 'penolakan' Saat aku hendak membalas pesan seokjin seketika terdengar bunyi klakson motor di depan rumah. Ah mungkin kah itu adiknya seokjin ?. Aku pun langsung mengambil tas dan beberapa berkas yang hari ini akan aku diskusikan bersama kelompok belajar. Aku pun keluar dan melihat ke depan pagar rumah. Ada seorang pria berambut blonde sedang berdiri didepan motor besar warna putih miliknya. Pria itu mengenakan celana gombrang berwarna putih dan sweatshirt nirvana berwarna hitam. Dari tampilannya, sepertinya umurnya tidak berbeda jauh denganku. Dengan cepat akupun menghampiri pria itu. Tidak lupa aku berpamitan dengan eomma yang sedang sibuk didapur. \"Ummm hai.\" Sapaku ragu2. Karena demi apapun aku tidak pernah bertegur sapa dengan orang asing apalagi seorang pria. Ia pun melirik ku sekilas dan langsung menyimpan ponselnya di saku. \"Jeon Jungkook?\" Tanyanya. Ya ampun.. suaranya seksi sekali. Akupun berdeham sedikit untuk mengusir rasa gugup ku. \"Iya, aku Jungkook. Temannya seokjin, taehyung kan?\" Ujarku berbasa basi. \"Ya.\" Jawabnya singkat. Hish dingin sekali pria ini. Untung kau tampan kalau tidak aku sudah mencabik-cabik wajahmu. \"Ayo berangkat. Seokjin noona bilang kau ada kelas pagi\" lanjutnya. Ia pun memberikan satu helm nya kepadaku. Akupun langsung memakainya dan menaiki motor. Sepanjang jalan kami hanya saling berdiam diri karena tidak ada topik yang harus kami bicarakan. Baguslah akupun sedang malas berbicara. Aku masih kesal pada seokjin. Saat aku sedang asik dengan pikiran ku tiba2 taehyung membuka suara. \"Kita isi bensin dulu. Kau tidak keberatan?\" Tanyanya. Akupun melihat jam ditanganku. Masih setengah jam lagi mata kuliah bahasa dimulai. Mungkin tidak masalah untuk mengisi bensin sebentar. \"Baiklah, kita isi bensin dulu.\" Ia pun berbelok menuju pom bensin terdekat. Saat taehyung sampai dan mematikan mesin motornya refleks aku turun dari motor taehyung. Karena ia akan mengisi bensin. Saat aku sudah turun dari motornya taehyung pun memandangku dengan tatapan aneh. Apa ada yang aneh dengan wajah ku atau pakaian ku?. Iapun seketika bertanya. \"Kenapa kau turun ?\" \"Hah ?\" Aku berpikir sejenak. Ia kan akan mengisi bensin jadi aku turun apa yang salah? Dan di saat itu juga aku meruntuki kebodohanku sendiri. Aku baru ingat jika tangki motor besar milik taehyung ini ada di depan bukan di bawah jok seperti motor matic milik seokjin. Aku pun dengan malu-malu menaiki motor taehyung lagi. Astaga!!! bodoh sekali aku! sepanjang jalan hingga sampai kawasan kampus aku masih meruntuki kebodohanku. Aku berjanji mulai detik ini aku tidak akan mau jika disuruh berangkat bersama adik seokjin.

A month earlier Animal Junior or as people called him AJ was a typical wolf attending school and trying out for sports. He really had no issue with anyone or no issue with the school. Some would consider AJ a role model or a hero type figure or a dreamy guy, but he just saw himself as AJ. He didn't compare. He didn't judge he enjoyed everyone's company.

Jika orang lain akan memilih menyerah terhadap hubungan jarak jauh. Tapi itu tidak berlaku bagi sehun dan chanyeol walau jarak antar kedua negara yang cukup jauh memisahkan mereka namun hal itu justru menjadi daya tarik tersendiri antara keduanya. Saat-saat dimana mereka harus saling percaya satu sama lain dengan keterbatasan intensitas bertemu, saat-saat dimana rasa rindu itu menghampiri keduanya bahkan perasaan dimana rasa lelah menjalin hubungan jarak jauh harus mereka lewati. Menjadi warna tersendiri dalam kisah percintaan mereka. Jika ada kesempatan untuk bertemu pun hanya bisa beberapa kali itu pun tidak akan lama, seperti saat ini ketika mereka bersama melepas rindu yang membuncah di hati. \"babby\" \"ne hyung\" \"kau tambah cantik saja sekarang\" Blush~ Pipi sehun seketika merona biasanya ketika ada orang yang mengatakan bahwa ia itu cantik, maka sehun akan berkata dengan tegas bahwa ia itu TAMPAN tapi berbeda jika yang mengatakan itu chanyeol maka wajah sehun akan langsung merah padam seperti kepiting rebus. \"ishh..

I'll probably post every other weekend so don't expect much. I'll post one or two this weekend to launch the series. Dealt with some stuff but now I'm officially back!! Missed you all! And like always I don't own nothing or nobody sadly. Notes at the bottom 2 days 3 hours and 27 minutes to go. 2 days 3 hours and 27 minutes until she would escape, escape the dull-lifeless walls of DEMA. As the guards ushered everyone forcefully into their tenements, she looked around, she was not going to miss this place. Vonya looked around and sighed. She made her way up to her tenement and quietly shut the door. She opened her desk drawer and looked at the yellow flower left there. She had somehow managed to grab it before Nico had taken her back to this dead city. She had managed to end up in the most deadly Bishops' section. Nico was always known to be ruthless and when she tried to escape she expienced that ruthlessness first hand. Now after a week had gone by Vonya broke out of that trance once again intending to fully escape. In 2 days the Bishops would have their common ceremony worshipping vialism. We renounce vialism! The Banditos echoed throughout her mind. Her last hope of escape was them, the Banditos were all that had given her hope. That somewhere in Trench other people had escaped as well. I can do this, I'm going to escape DEMA in two days, escape Nico... 2 days and 3 hours later... Vonya could hear the guards running behind her. It would only take so much time before Nico found out. The tunnels under DEMA were nothing special, the meaning of said tunnels were something much more meaningful then most would ever find out. Vonya could see light at the end of the tunnel and the feeling of freedom rushed around her. She ran harder than she ever had and the light gradually got bigger. She bust out the tunnel breathing the fresh air in, the guards footsteps were getting louder now. She ran toward the opening in the valley and pushed even harder. Vonya looked behind her and felt her heart break, there was a Bishop riding a white horse catching up to her. It's Nico, I know it, he's to take me back! East is up! The Banditos voices echoed through her mind and Vonya had that last adrenaline rush pick up. She was almost there! She could see the end of the valley! Run! Run! Run! Don't let Nico take you back there! Vonya reached the end of the valley and turned a hard right, running towards what looked like a wooded area. She reached the wooded area and heard the horses hooves stop. Vonya kept running for what felt like forever never letting up for a second. When Vonya broke through the other side she finally stopped and looked around. The sun had set and the sky was colored in bright pastels. Sighing in relief Vonya sat down on a fallen log. She didn't know how long she had sat there and stared at Trench but the moon had long risen. Behind her a twig snapped and in a hurry Vonya whipped around in time to face a dark haired man. He had mocha brown eyes and a huge smile. Vonya had her hand half-way to his face before he caught it and held it tightly. \"Well, hello to you too. What is someone doing out by themselves in the middle of Trench?\" Vonya twisted her wrist out of his grip and glared at him. \"Who are you! I'm not going back to DEMA!\" Vonya practically shouted. The strangers eyes grew as wide as the full moon. \"W-where are you from? Did you escape! DEMA!\" Vonya stared at him for a second, he wore bright yellow and was a decent build. \"Who's asking? Do you work for Nico?\" \"I-I'm Josh! How did you escape DEMA? By yourself! Did Tyler help you, if so he didn't say anything to me!\" \"We Josh, that doesn't matter. Who are you and what do you want?\" Should I trust him? He doesn't look like any guard I've ever seen... \"I'm..\" Josh cleared his throat and smiled. \"I'm Josh, leader of the Banditos.\" Vonya's eyes grew wide and her mouth fell open. \"You're a Bandito? The leader?\" \"Yes, and who are you and did you really escape DEMA?\" \"I'm Von- V. Just V.\" Josh nodded and put out his hand. \"Well V, let me show you to our camp and talk about how you somehow managed to escape, do you know Tyler by any chance?\" \"Run! Go without me! They need you!\" The man turned around and ran towards the tunnel. Vonya turned around running headfirst into the guards. They need him, she wasn't nearly as important. It was her turn to help him after all he had done for her. \" Vonya no!\" \"V?\" Vonya blinked and looked into the eyes of Josh. So trusting. Too trusting. \"Yeah? Uh, no, who's Tyler?\" Josh smiled and turned around. \"Follow me!\" So Vonya followed this stranger into Trench, trusting him to guide her. It felt as if they had been walking forever. Vonya was tired and hungry and cold, yet Josh had said nothing about taking a break. Maybe this was a bad idea... Vonya's legs were falling off and the sky was definitely getting lighter. Josh was a couple feet ahead and Vonya saw a log up ahead. Josh simply walked over but Vonya took the opportunity to sit down and massage her legs. Josh didn't seem to notice and went on, Vonya was just too tire for call out to him. I hope he's not mad at me for taking a break for a second... Before Vonya knew it, her eyelids were drooping at a dangerous level. A quick nap wouldn't hurt anyone... The first thing Vonya heard was voices, a lot of voices and they were loud. Vonya slowly blinked her eyes open to see the top of a gray tent. Slowly sitting up she looked around and noticed all the cots around her. They were all empty except for her cot of course. The shouting outside was becoming a nuisance and causing a huge headache to make it was around her skull. \"Nngh.\" It was only a whisper of breath that came out but it was if the whole world heard it. \"Your awake!!\" A voice called from her left. A blonde girl in her mid-40's stepped into her view. \"I was becoming worried.\" She laughed nervously. \"I'm Brenda, and... you look like your in pain?\" \"What's all that noise and why is it so loud? And while we're at it, where am I?\" Brenda smiled widely, \"Well, that's Josh and Tyler playing for the other Banditos. It's loud because the med tent is close to the main fire. Lastly, you're at the Bandito camp in my med tent.\" \"Can't they be quieter!\" \"Well, sorry V but I can give you something to ease the pain, let me guess. Headache?\" Vonya nodded which didn't help her aching head at all. She managed to sputter out a \"How do you know my name?\" Brenda, who had gone to a table turned around and smiled. \"Josh told us your name when he brought you in... he, uh. Can tell you the rest later. Right now, take these.\" Brenda handed Vonya two small pill-like objects. Vonya greedily took them and popped them into her mouth, her eyelids starting drooping seconds later and the noise got numbed out. Vonya sighed and let darkness take her, thinking about how she was finally free and with Banditos! Nico will never get me here, I finally feel safe. I finally feel something . What Vonya noticed first was muffled talking. Where was she? Oh right, in the Bandito camp! The muffled slowly became whispering of what sounded like two girls. \"Where did Josh find her Brenda? Has he said anything to you? I don't believe that she escaped DEMA all by herself!\" \"I don't know Jenna. Did Tyler mention anything about a recent breakout that he was gonna do?\" \"No. And he would mention it to me if he did...\" \"Well, I don't know. We'll ask her about it when she wakes up, now come help me with a splinter Brad has..\" Vonya heard Jenna and Brenda leave and opened her eyes to look around once again. It was just about the same except the sun shone through the gray tent. I wa sour that long? Vonya slowly stood up and took stock on how she felt. She took a few steps and walked over to the entrance. Pulling back the flap she look around. Should I go find someone? What if she weren't welcome? Vonya sighed and stepped out into the camp. Banditos were everywhere, smiling and talking, kid Banditos were running around screaming in delight. Vonya smiled as she looked around and saw what it was to feel alive. Her courage gathered and she made another few steps out into the open. She stood still for a while and just looked at the sight of everyone so happy. Someone cleared her throat behind her and Vonya jumped. She turned around quickly and saw Josh standing there smiling at her. She looked down to hide the slight pink on her cheeks for looking so childish. \"Glad to see you enjoying yourself.\" Ohs smiled and Vonya looked back up. \"You were pretty tired, definitely know how to sneak away. I went about a mile and a half without noticing you were behind me.\" \"I was just tired. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry that I scared you too.\" \"It's okay, I found you passed out on a log.\" \"How did you get me here?\" Vonya motioned to the camp and Banditos talking and haveing a good time. \"Well, I, uh.\" Josh looked down and said awkwardly \"I carried you...\" Josh's hand moved so it was rubbing his neck awkwardly. Vonya started to laugh loudly. \"You make it seem like a crime! It's no big deal!\" Josh looked up and laughed in relief. \"Good! I wasn't sure if you would think I was a horrible thing! By the way, I'm sorry I gave you a headache, I play the drums and it was one of those nights... Brenda told me.\" Vonya sighed \"No big deal. But since I'm here, mind showing me around this amazing camp? DEMA was gray and lifeless and so far this is the best place I've ever seen. Is the rest of Trench like this?\" Josh laughed and smiled those beautiful white teeth once again. \"Of course, your our honored guest. I'll introduce you to Tyler and Jenna too.\" Josh started walking and turned around looking at Vonya. \"Come on!\" Vonya laughed and ran to catch up to Josh. This couldn't be that bad. Better than DEMA had ever been, and Josh is so much nicer that Nico. I finally made it! I finally escaped DEMA, I'm free! Josh had showed Vonya the main meeting place, tents where other Banditos and the rest of the med tent. Vonya was becoming overwhelmed when Josh stopped at a bigger tent. \"This is the last place I want to show you. I know the Bandito camp can be overwhelming, but this is the last thing you need to deal with today. I promise.\" Vonya smiled and looked up at Josh. \"It is a bit overwhelming, but I trust you Josh.\" It has only been a day or two and vonya felt like she'd known Josh her whole life. Josh smiled and walked up to the tent, pulling back the flap he gestured inside. Vonya could hear some talking inside and cautiously walked in. She was met with two pairs of eyes staring back at her. There was man with dark brown hair that was shaved and a girl with long blonde hair and a beautiful smile. The girl was first to speak. \"Hello! You're V? Right?\" Vonya recognized the voice to belong to Jenna, the girl she heard earlier. Vonya nodded shyly, uncomfortable from all the stares. The man spoke next and had a small smile that looked more like a grimace. \"Well, hello V. Cool name by the way. I'm Tyler and this is Jenna.\" They both waved their hands in greeting again. Josh who had been standing there watching the exchange butted in. \"This is Tyler and Jenna's tent, thought you'd like to meet them.\" Josh motioned to the couple that were holding hands. \"My tent is on the other side of camp but I thought you'd like to meet them. Plus we can see my tent another day.\" Vonya nodded and looked around the comfy tent. It had a small table and chair set along with a desk full of papers and maps. \"Sorry it's not very organized right now. I didn't know Josh was bringing company.\" Tyler spoke up. \"It's okay.\" Vonya stopped looking around and stood awkwardly. Jenna sense fit and came to the rescue. \"You must be SUPER hungry, let's go get some food and talk later. I know I'm starving myself.\" Vonya silently sighed in relief and followed the trio back outside the tent and to the big fire that was raging in the middle of the camp. There were two Banditos handing out bowls that contained vegetables and oats. It looked good and smelled delicious. Josh who had took lead turned around and handed Vonya a bowl. She took it gratefully and waited until Josh had one too. He lead her to a circle of logs and motioned to sit down. Tyler and Jenna sat down seconds later and dug in. The food was more delicious than Vonya had ever tasted and finished the bowl in a couple bites. She didn't realize she was so hungry! Josh started laughing and she looked up. \"I didn't realize you were so hungry. Did you even get a breath in?\" Josh jokes. Vonya turned a nice shade of red and looked down. \"The food is delicious! What is this? Did it come from heaven?\" Vonya questioned. Josh laughed again. \"Just a couple of vegetables!\" Josh snorted again and went back to eating, but with a huge smile on his face. After a couple minutes of silence Jenna broke it with the question Vonya had been dreading. \"So... how did you escape and what section were you in?\" Vonya swallowed and looked at her feet. \"I was in Nicks section. I can't really remember how I escaped it just kind of happened. I think I blacked-out a couple of times. I'm sorry I can't help you more.\" Jenna looked at Vonya sympathetically. Before she could say anything, Tyler butted in. \"It's okay, the main thing is that you escaped. I can't believe you escaped from Nico's section too! I came from there as well and he was no fun!\" Tyler laughed a little harder than intended, trying to lighten the mood some more. Vonya smiled a little at the joke and shook her head. \"Well I don't know about you, but I'm tired. Brenda can help you get settled down. I'll see everyone tomorrow.\" Josh stood up and waved goodbye and called Brenda over. After an hour or so of Brenda introducing everything that the Banditos do she waved Vonya off to a cot in the med tent and told her to get some rest. \"We'll deal with everything else tomorrow, right now all you need is some good rest.\" \"Thank you.\" Is all Vonya was able to murder out before she fell asleep. She could hear a small voice say out to her from somewhere in the darkness. Sahlo Folina Then the voice stopped. Tell me what you think! Also if you want anything added I'm willing. I'll be making other things that include the following categories... • SUPERNATURAL • MORE TØP • THE GOOD DOCTOR • THE GIFTED • OC ADVENTURES Also, I post every other weekend, if I don't have much going on maybe every weekend.

Yesung segera berlari ke mansion milik Kyuhyun kekasih Ryeowook nam dongsaeng yang hanya terpisah 2 rumah yang tidak terlalu besar tapi cukup megah dari mansionya setelah sebuah nomor tanpa nama menghubunginya dan mengatakan kalau Ryeowook tidak akan pernah kembali padanya. \"Mwo!, hyung tenanglah, masuklah dulu!\" pinta Kyuhyun menuntun Yesung yang masih terengah-engah masuk ke dalam mansionya yang sangat besar. Dengan sigap kepala maid di mansion Kyuhyun segera mengambil air putih untuk tamu tuannya. \"Minumlah dulu hyung, lalu ceritakan dengan detail dan tenang, bagaimana hyung tau kalau Wook-ie di culik?\" pinta Kyuhun yang langsung di turuti oleh Yesung dan meneguk habis 1 gelas air putih dalam satu tegukan. Setelah merasa tenang Yesung bercerita apa yang telah membuatnya sangat khawatir \"Tadi ada yang menghubungi hyung setelah Ryeowook pamit untuk bertemu Donghae, Ryeowook menemui Donghae ingin membicarakan hubungan mereka setelah kau resmi jadi kekasihnya Kyuu!\" jelas Yesung dalam 1 tarikan nafas walaupun dirinya sudah tenang, tapi tetap saja Yesung di liputi khawatir dengan keadaan dongsaengnya tersebut. sedangkan Kyuhyun tetap tenang tidak satu dua kali dia menghadapi masalah seperti ini. walupun tetap ada rasa khawatir akan kekasihnya paling tidak Kyuhyun bisa bersikap lebih tenang \"hajima hyung, hyung bisa tunjukkan nomer yang menghubungi hyung ne!\" ujar Kyuhyun berusaha membuat tenang calon kakak iparnya walaupun sebenernya Kyuhyun juga sangat khawatir. Tanpa berbicara apapun Yesung menuruti permintaan Kyuhyun mengambil hpnya dan menunjukkan nomor yang menghubunginya. kenapa tidak mencari gps hp Ryeowook?, karena Ryeowook meninggalkan hpnya di kamar. Dengan cekatan Kyuhyun menyambungkan no hp tersebut dengan gps miliknya \"nah tersambung!, hyung aku ke kamar dulu ne, akan ku bawa barang yang mungkin akan penting untuk alat-alat yang terpasang di mobil!\" setelah mengucapkan perkataanya Kyuhyun memasuki kamar dan segera keluar. tidak penting memang barang-barang yang dia bawa. seperti alat pelacak khusus, beberapa baju Ryeowok dll. kalau kalian bertanya-tanya alasan Kyuhyun membawa baju Ryeowook karena salah satu alat buatanya bersama rekanya memang membutuhkan barang yang berhubungan dengan apa yang akan di lacak. \"Hyung palli kita berangkat, sebelum Donghae mengetahui kita melacak mereka melalui gps hpnya!, dan jika dia mematikannya!, kita kehilangan jejak mereka!\" ujar Kyuhyun keluar dari mansionya tanpa menutup pintu kembali, untuk apa dia khawatir toh di mansion besarnya banyak maid dan beberapa bodyguard yang menjaga mansionya. dengan mudah mobil sport yang di tumpangi Kyuhyun dan Yesung melesat di tengah jalan yang mulai lengang tersebut. Bagaimana tidak lengang jam menunjukkan pukul 10 malam dimana kebanyakan orang lebih memilih untuk menuju ke pulau mimpi daripada kelayapan di luar rumah. Hingga tidak lama kemudian suara Kyuhyun yang mengumpat terdengar jelas oleh Yesung yang berada di sampingnya fuck Kyuhyun segera menepikan mobilnya kepinggir jalan, membuat Yesung mengernyit heran dan semakin panik. Bagaimana tidak, saat ini keadaan dongsaengnya kini sedang dalam bahaya sedangkan Kyuhyun menghentikan mobilnya tanpa Yesung tau alasanya \"Waeyo Kyu?, kenapa berhenti?, palli kita selamatkan Wook-ie!\" kepanikan Yesung membuat Kyuhyun kehilangan ketenangan, jika sudah begini Kyuhyun akan ikut bingung bahkan emosinya bisa saja tersulut \"Hyung jangan membuat ku panik, gps nya mati. aku akan menggunakan alat pelacak lain yang terpasang di dalam mobil!, katakan padaku diamana Ryeowook menemui Donghae tadi?\" bentak Kyuhyun yang memang sudah tersulut emosi karena ikut panik. \"Taman kota!\" jawaban singkat Yesung cukup untuk petunjuk. Kyuhyun segera melajukan mobil ke taman kota dimana Donghae dan Ryeowook bertemu, di depan tempat masuk taman Kyuhyun mengotak atik alat pelacak yang sengaja dia buat bersama rekan seangkatanya waktu kuliah dulu. Iq mereka yang di atas rata-rata memudahkan mereka untuk mengerjakan tugas, atau pun membuat sebuah penemuan untuk pekerjaan mereka sekarang. Tidak jarang Kyuhyun dan Kibum di tempatkan dalam 1 kelompok kalau ada kasus yang berat. seperti alat pelacak yang Kyuhyun gunakan saat ini juga ciptaan mereka. jika polisi mempunyai anjing pelacak maka mereka mempunyai mobil pelacak, semua hal ada kekurangan juga kelebihannya, ciptaan mereka pun juga mempunyai kelemahan, alat pelacak yang di pasang pada mobil mereka hanya bisa di gunakan saat malam hari, dan hanya untuk alat tranaportasi tidak berguna untuk pejalan kaki. kelebihanya sejauh apapun mobil yang di lacak, seramai apapun jalan raya, walaupun banyak kendaraan umum yang sama, alat mereka tetap bisa melacak kebaradaan mobil yang mereka targetkan. Kyuhyun menyalakan lampu sein dari alat mereka. yah lampu mobil Kyuhyun tidak hanya 1 tapi 2, lampu sein mobil asli dan lampu sein yang terhubung dengan alat ciptaan mereka. setelah memastikan lampu dan alatnya tidak bermasalah Kyuhyun segera menyalakan mobilnya, mengatur kecepatan dan dia melepaskan kemudi mobilnya untuk menghubungi seseorang. Yesung yang melihat mobil Kyuhyun melesat dengan kecepatan di atas rata-rata histeris, terlebih Kyuhyun melepas kemudi mobilnya untuk menhubungi seseorang \"Cho Kyuhyun, kau jangan gila!, kita harus selamatkan Ryeowok bukan mengantar nyawa pada maut!, kendalikan kemudinya!\" teriakan Yesung sukses membuat jantung Kyuhyun hampir lepas. dengan terpaksa Kyuhyun memutus sambungan panggilanya tanpa tahu nomer yang dia hubungi sudah tersambung apa belum. \"Hyung kau hampir membuat ku mati, lagi pula hyung tidak perlu kha...\" belum selesai Kyuhyun menjelaskan cara kerja penemuanya Yesung sudah memotongnya dengan berteriak LAGI \"kau gila Kyu, bagaimana aku tidak khawatir kalau kau melepas tanganmu dari kemudi, sedangkan kecepatan mobilmu di atas normal Cho Kyuhyun!\" teriakan Yesung benar-benar membuat emosi Kyuhyun tersulut \"hyung dengarkan Penjelasan ku dulu. hhhh hhhh!\" Teriak Kyuhyun balik dengan menatap tajam Yesung tanpa peduli dengan ramainya jalan raya. toh Kyuhyun hanya mengendalikan kecepatan mobilnya saja sisanya alat ciptaanya yang mengendalikan mobil Kyuhyun. Kyuhyun menarik nafas sebelum menjelaskan bagaimana cara kerja mobilnya \"hyung mobil ku sudah sepenuhnya di kendalikan oleh alat ciptaan ku dan Kibum, aku hanya perlu mengendalikan kecepatan mobil ini saja hyung, hyung tenang lah, aku akan menghubungi Jungso hyung dan Hyuk-ie noona agar membantuku!, biarkan aku berpikir jernih hyung, aku masih mencintai Wook-ie, aku ingin menikahinya, aku pastikan Wook-ie akan selamat di tangan kita tanpa luka sedikitpun arraseo!\" penjelasan Kyuhyun yang panjang kali lebar membuat Yesung melongo sempurna dan merasa bersalah. dan entah kenapa Yesung menurut saja dengan perintah Kyuhyun untuk tenang. seperti anak kecil yang di marahi oleh orang tuanya hanya diam dan menurut. Setelah mendapatkan respon anggukan dari namja di sebelahnya. Kyuhyun sekali lagi menghubungi noonanya yang memang menjabat sebagai kepala polisi dan Jungso hyungnya bertugas memburu para penjahat yang telah di laporkan. sebenarnya Jungso bisa meminta untuk menjadi wakil kepala bagian tapi Jungso ingin sekali langsung turun tangan pada semua kasus. Terbalik memang karena Jungso anak tertua, tapi Jungso yakin kepolisian akan tetap aman di pegang oleh Hyukjae yeodongsaengnya \"Hyukk-ie noona, Jungso hyung tidak bertugas kan?, tolong aku hyung jeball!\" perkataan Kyuhyun sukses membuat Hyukjae khawatir \"Waeyo Kyu?, neo gwenchana?, kau kenapa Kyu?, ada apa denganmu?\" tanya Eunhyuk berturut-turut tanpa jeda dan dengan segera dia menghubungi Jungso yang berada di ruanganya \"oppa bisa ke ruangan ku sekarang?, Kyunn-ie sedang ada dalam masalah oppa!\" karena Eunhyuk terlalu khawatir, akhirnya dia langsung menghubungi Jungso dan segera memutuskan sambungan setelah mengeluarkan kekhawatiranya. Tanpa mendengarkan penjelasan Kyuhyun. Ya Eunhyuk menghubungi Jungso tanpa mengakhiri sambungan teleponya dengan Kyuhyun \"nooooonaaaaaa!, kau tidak mendengar ku eoh?\" teriak Kyuhyun dari seberang dan sukses membuat Eunhyuk menjauhkan hpnya dari telinganya, sebelum gendang telinganya benar-benar pecah. \"mianhae Kyu, noona menghubungi Jungso oppa langsung, noona khawatir denganmu Kyu!, kau dimana sekarang?, lalu apa yang terjadi padamu?\" tanya Eunhyuk lagi \"Gwenchana hyung, hanya saja Wook-ie di culik kekasihnya, aku akan menjelaskan kejadianya nanti aku sudah sampai tempat dimana Wook-ie di sekap noona, dia di sekap di apartemen kawasan Daegu!, aku minta Jungso hyung kesini jeball, aku tutup dulu noona, aku harus cepat-cepat menolong Wook-ie!\" dan Kyuhyun memutuskan sambunganya secara sepihak tanpa menunggu jawaban ataupun pertanyaan yang mungkin saja terlontar dari noonanya langsung. setelah mobilnya berhenti di parkiran apartemen bahkan mobil Kyuhyun terparkir di sebelah mobil Donghae sang target Yesung dan Kyuhyun tidak mau berlama-lama menghabiskan waktu. mereka segera menuju ruangan cctv apartemen yang tentu saja di jaga oleh orang, dan benar saja 2 orang berbadan besar menjaga samping pintu kanan dan kiri ruang cctv \"Annyeonghaseyo, saya detektive Cho dari seoul, ada kasus penculikan dan alat pelacak ku memberitahuku salah satu penghuni kamar apartemen ini adalah target saya dia menyembunyikan tawananya di kamar!\" Jelas Kyuhyun berusaha sesopan mungkin. tapi percuma saja perkenalanya dengan kedua orang berbadan besar dengan pakaian serba hitam tetap kekeh melarangnya masuk bahkan mereka meminta bukti pada Kyuhyun dan nahasnya Kyuhyun lupa membawa bukti miliknya \"Buktikan identitas anda!\" salah satu orang berbadan besar meminta identitas milik Kyuhyun yang di jawab gumaman Oleh Kyuhyun \"sheeet, hyung aku lupa membawa kartu identitas ku!\" adu Kyuhyun pada Yesung dengan berbisik \"aku tidak butuh izinmu, biarkan aku masuk sekarang, dongsaeng ku dalam masalah sekarang!\" teriak Yesung memaksa masuk Setelah mendengar perkataan Kyuhyun dan langsung di hadang oleh kedua orang berbadan besar tersebut. membuat Yesung pun mulai kalap tanganya mulai terangkat dan akan segera melayangkan pukulan kalau saja sebuah suara tidak membuatnya berhenti \"ada apa ini?\" sebuah suara menghentikan tangan Yesung yang hanya terkepal melayang di udara dan mengalihkan tatapanya pada pemilik suara yang berani menghentikan aktifitasnya tidak hanya Yesung semua yang ada di situ pun menatap pemilik suara. \"kau Sim Changmin?\" tanya Kyuhyun memastikan penglihatanya tidak salah \"Yak, mudah sekali kau melupakan ku Kyu?, bahkan aku masih ingat wajah imutmu itu!, ada perlu apa kau kemari?, dan darimana kau tau apartemen ini?\" tanya Changmin beruntun pada tujuan awalnya setelah berbasa basi pasa sahabatnya yang sudah lama tidak dia temui. \"Aku tampan Chwang bukan imut, kau harus ingat itu!. Wook-ie! Chwang apa ada orang bernama Donghae yang menempati salah satu kamar apartemen di sini?, mobil ku mengarah kemari!\" Ujar Kyuhyun menjelaskan tujuanya ke apartemen yang dia perkirakan milik sahabatnya itu, dengan cepat Changmin mengajak Yesung dan Kyuhyun memasuki ruang cctv. Changmin Kyuhyun, Kibum dan Minho bersahabat sewaktu SMA hingga kuliah. Kyuhyun harus meninggalkan ketiga sahabatnya saat sang appa Cho Younghwan memintanya melanjutkan kuliah di amerika, mengambil jurusan master di bidang bisnis membuat mereka ber4 harus terpisah selama 1 tahun, karena kecerdasan Kyuhyun membuatnya cepat lulus. tapi sayang Kyuhyun lebih memilih menjadi detektif dan bergabung dengan noona juga hyungnya Di kantor polisi. \"ya ada di kamar nomer 1106, tapi untuk apa kau mencari pemilik kamar itu Kyu?\" jawab dan tanya Changmin penasaran sambil memperhatikan Kyuhyun yang sibuk mengamati komputer di depanya \"Wook-ie dia kekasih ku dan dia culik oleh Donghae saat ingin memutuskan hubungan mereka Chwang!, sial dia menyiksa Wook-ie!\" jawab Kyuhyun di sertai umpatan-umpatan dari mulutnya. Kyuhyun dengan cepat mengambil ponsel dari sakunya saat merasa ada sebuah getaran di dalam celananya \"Yeoboseyo hyung, kau sudah sampai?\" \"aku di ruang cctv hyung, bisakah hyung kesana dahulu?, aku menyusulmu nanti hyung, aku sudah menemukan Wook-ie dia di siksa aku akan meminta pada Chwang kartu cadangan!, dia di kamar no 1106 hyung!\" Kyuhyun memutuskan sambunganya setelah memberitahu kamar yang Donghae tempati \"Chwang bisa kau beri aku card cadangan kamar apartemen itu?\" pinta Kyuhyun sebelum meninggalkan ruang cctv dan menuju kamar Donghae \"tentu saja, tunggu sebentar aku akan suruh sekertaris ku membawa kemari!\" jawab Changmin dan segera mengambil ponsel dari sakunya untuk menghubungi sekertaris pribadinya menyuruhnya agar membawa card cadangan untuk Kyuhyun. \"Kyu kau ada waktu untuk kita berbicara berdua?, sudah 1tahun kita tidak bersama-sama lagi!\" sambil menunggu sang sekertaris Changmin berusaha meminta waktu pada kyuhyun \"aku tidak tau Chwang!, kau hubungi saja aku kapan kau ada waktu luang dan aku akan berusaha mengaturnya!\" jawaban Kyuhyun membuat Changmin jengah, sahabat satunya ini selalu ada alasan di saat dirinya tidak ingin keluar \"Berikan ponselmu!\" permintaan ahh lebih tepatnya perintah Changmin membuat kening Kyuhyun berkerut, walaupun begitu Kyuhyun tetap menyerahkan ponselnya pada sahabatnya. Changmin hanya menghubungi no ponselnya lewat ponsel Kyuhyun dan segera menyimpan no pribadinya pada hp Kyuhyun. Sekertaris pribadi Changmin datang bertepatan dengan selesainya changmin mengotak atik ponsel Kyuhyun \"Ini kartunya detektiv Cho, ah ya aku sudah menyimpan nomer ku pada ponselmu!, aku akan menghubungimu nanti!\" ujar Changmin sambil memberikan kartu cadangan untuk membuka apartemen. \"Gomawo Chwang!, kajja hyung!\" Kyuhyun dan Yesung segera keluar dari ruang cctv dan memasuki lift untuk naik ke kamar 1106. Jangan tanyakan Yesung sedaritadi tidak muncul dia menjadi obat nyamuk antara kedua shabat dekat calon adik iparnya saat di ruang cctv. Ting Pintu lift terbuka, di sana sudah ada Jungso hyungnya yang menunggu dengan berusaha sabar, dengan cepat Kyuhyun membuka pintu apartemen milik Donghae menggunakan kartu cadangan yang dia dapat dari Changmin sahabatnya. Kyuhyun samar-samar mendengar suara tangisan, dengan sangat berhati-hati dia mendekati arah suara. kyuhyun dapat melihat Donghae memaksa untuk mencium bibir pink milik Wook-ie kekasihnya. Kyuhyun hampir saja kehilangan kendali kalau saja Jungso tidak menarik pergelangan tanganya saat ingin melangkah menuju Wook-ie dan Donghae. \"Kyun-ie tenanglah jangan gegabah kau tidak mau nyawa kekasihmu dalam bahaya bukan?\" peringat Jungso pada Kyuhyun dan mendapat anggukan dari Kyuhyun. Jungso bernafas lega kali ini Kyuhyun menurutinya. \"kumohon lepaskan aku oppa!, aku sudah tidak mencintaimu aku memcintai Kyuhyun!\" Mendengar perkataan Ryeowook Donghae semakin geram. Donghae mencengkeram dagu Ryeowook kasar mencium bibir pink itu dengan kasar lidahnya berusaha menerobos mulut Ryeowook yang tertutup rapat, karena geram Donghae menggigit bibir bawah Ryeowok hingga berdarah rasa asin dari darah yang keluar dari bibir Ryeowook bercampur dengan ludah mereka. Airmata mengalir dari mata indah yang berwarna cramael itu. Dengan jelas Kyuhyun melihat airmata kekasihnya yang selama beberapa minggu ini dia jaga agar tidak keluar mengalir begitu saja. Kyuhyun lagi-lagi hampir saja kehilangan kendali kalau saja Jungso tidak menarik pergelangan tanganya yang terkepal erat saat ingin melangkah menuju Ryeowook dan Donghae. \"Huuft arraseo aku serahkan pada Jungso hyung!, jangan biarkan dia berbuat lebih jauh hyung!\" pasrah Kyuhyun pada Jungso dengan berbisik. Membiarkan hyungnya tersebut menjalankan tugasnya \"Hentikan percobaan pemerkosaan anda!\" Suara Jungso yang menggelegar memenuhi ruangan membuat kedua orang yang berada di kamar tersebut menoleh ke arahnya. Donghae kaget akan kedatanganya Jungso beserta anggotanya termasuk Kyuhyun dan Yesung sedangkan Wook-ie tidak tau harus senang apa sedih?, senang karena dirinya terselamatkan sedih karena malu banyak yang tahu dirinya akan di perkosa terlebih Kyuhyun dan Yesung juga ada di sana \"KKKyuhyun\" Ryeowook sangat ingin berlari dan berteriak memanggil nama kekasihnya yang kini berada di hadapanya, tapi entah mengapa badanya terasa sangat lemah saat ini. Donghae yang sadar hidupnya terancam segera menarik Ryeowook dalam tubuhnya mengambil pisau yang saat itu memang tergeletak di meja dapurnya dan mengarahkan pisau tersebut pada leher Ryeowook yang tentu saja membuat semua orang berteriak histeris akan perbuatanya \"Wook-ie!, lepaskan tangan kotormu dari kekasih ku brengsek!\" teriak Kyuhyun emosi, Jungso yang sudah terbiasa menghadapi hal seperti ini pun menenangkan dongsaengnya agar tidak bertindak gegabah \"Kyu jangan gegabah tahan emosimu, serahkan semua pada hyung! arra!\" ujar Jungso dan berhasil membuat dongsaengnya lebih tenang \"Kalau kalian ingin Ryeowook selamat minggir semua!, jangan halangi jalan ku!\" teeiakan Donghae sukses membuat perhatian Jungso dan Kyuhyun mengarah ke arahnya. merasa tidak ada pergerakan dari para pilisi Donghae kembali berteriak \"kenapa tidak minggir?, aku bilang minggir atau dia akan akan mati di hadapan mu Yesung hyung, Cho Kyuhyun!\" ancamanya kali ini berhasil Donghae berjalan mundur di tengah-tengah para polisi juga Kyuhyun dan Yesung menuju kamar untuk mengambil kunci mobil Donghae sebelum keluar dari apartemennya. Kyuhyun yang tau Donghae akan membawa kabur Ryeowook segera menghubungi seseorang. sedangkan Di lantai bawah Changmin yang saat itu memang sengaja ingin mengecek keadaan tvxq apartemen tanpa sengaja melihat Donghae menggiring seorang yeoja mungil yang cantik dengan pisau menempel di leher yeoja tersebut membuat Changmin khawatir. Dia tidak mau ada kasus pembunuhan di apartemenya. \"hei apa yang kau lakukan!\" teriak Changmin menghampiri Donghae dan teriakan Changmin sukses mengundang perhatian orang sekitarnya \"Jangan mendekat, atau dia akan mati di sini!, di depan kalian!\" ancam Donghae dan bertepatan dengan itu ponsel dalam saku celana Changmin bergetar \"Yeob...\" \"turuti perkataan Donghae aku tidak mau Wook-ie celaka!\" \"Hhh arraseo!\" sambungan terputus Changmin segera mengisyaratkan kepada semua body guardnya agar tidak ikut campur urusan sahabatnya Yang langsung di turuti oleh semua para bodyguardnya. Donghae tersenyum sinis melanjutkan jalan mundurnya menuju parkiran apartmen dan memasuki mobilnya setelah menyuruh Ryeowook dengan paksa masuk terlebih dahulu. Donghae menjalankan mobilnya di atas rata-rata yang di ikuti oleh Kyuhyun di belakangnya tetap memggunakan alat pelacak yang terpasang pada mobilnya. \"Kita akan ke mokpo Chagiya agar si brengsek Kyuhyun tidak bisa mengambilmu dariku lagi!\" ujar Donghae pada Ryeowook tetap fokus pada jalanan, dia akan segera memasuki kota mokpo kalau saja tidak ada seseorang yang tiba-tiba memakaikan kalung padanya dan membuatnya berjengit kaget dan terpaksa harus menepikan mobilnya. Donghae segera membalikkan badanya ingin melihat siapa orang yang lancang memakaikan sebuag accesoris di leher putih mulusnya \"kau keluar dari mobil sekarang!, dan kau jangan coba-coba menghentikannya kalung itu ku buat spesial khusus untuk orang-orang seperti mu!\" ujar orang tersebut menyuruh Ryeowook keluar dan memberitahu pada Donghae akan kalung yang kini terpasang di lehernya. \"Cepat kyuhyun menunggumu di belakang!\" ujar namja Tersebut datar dan dingin yang tidak di ketahui Donghaae ataupun Ryeowook. sadar kalau orang itu menyelamatkanya Ryeowook segera keluar dari mobil tapi baru saja dia menyentuh pintu mobil, Donghae sudah menahan tanganya \"Jangan keluar dari sini atau nyawamu melayang sekarang juga!, aaargh!\" suara Donghae termasuk keras tapi tidak berpengaruh pada orang di bangku belakang. orang itu tetap santai bersandar pada kursi mobil menatap ke arah Donghae dan Ryeowok yang terlihat ketakutan akibat ancaman Donghae. \"ck, Sudah aku bilang jangan menghentikanya, kalung itu akan bereaksi dengan sendirinya dia hanya akan menuruti apa yang aku katakan dan pikirkan!, nyawamu yang akan melayang kalau kau tetap mempertahankanya di sini!\" ucap namja misterius tersebut dengan datar dan dingin. Tidak lama ada seseorang yang mengetuk kaca mobil Donghae di sebelah Ryeowok \"Kyuu tolong aku!\" teriak Ryeowook dari dalam tanpa dia tahu suaranya terdengar atau tidak di telinga Kyuhyun \"keluarlah jangan takut pada Donghae!\" lagi orang misterius itu menyuruhnya keluar tanpa ragu seolah dirinya benar-benar akan baik-baik saja akan keselamatan nyawanya. \"ck baiklah biar aku yang keluar dan membiarkan Donghae menculikmu dan memperkosamu seperti tadi!\" merasa tidak ada pergerakan dari Ryeowook. namja misterius itu mengancam lagi dan membuahkan hasil. secepat kilat Ryeowook membuka pintu dan menghambur kedalam pelukan Kyuhyun. Dan di susul oleh namja misterius beserta Donghae keluar dari mobil. Melihat Donghae keluar dengan seseorang Jungso menghampiri mereka segera dan memborgol tangan Donghae. \"ikut kami ke kantor polisi!, gomawo sudah membantu kami menangkap buronan!\" ujar Jungso pada Donghae dan namja misterius tersebut setelah Donghae di ambil alih oleh bawahanya \"Cheonma Jungso hyung, lagipula untuk pertama kalinya seorang cho Kyuhyun meminta bantuan ku!\" jawab namja misterius tadi sambil membuka masker dan kacamatanya yang sedaritadi namja itu memakai masker dan kacamata hitam. \"Ehm aku melakukanya hanya untuk menyelamatkan kekasih ku Kim Kibum, dan aku meminta bantuanmu untuk yang pertama dan terakhir kalinya!\" sahut Kyuhyun tidak mau mengakui ucapan sahabatnya yang memang di minta Kyuhyun untuk membantunya tadi. ya namja misterius itu adalah Kim Kibum sahabat Kyuhyun Changmin dan Minho. 5tahun kemudian Ryeowook mematut diri di depan cermin, memastikan penampilanya memuaskan dan tidak ada cela sedikitpun di depan sang suami ataupun sang pengantin yang kini telah menjadi kakak iparnya. Dengan dress kemben berwarna biru muda membalut tubuh mungilnya hingga paha dengan rambut sepinggang yang tergerai di hiasi bandana berwarna senada dengan dressnya membuat penampilan Ryeowook semakin mempesona. Ryeowook berjengit kaget saat merasakan sebuah lengan kokoh melingkar di pinggangnya dan sebuah kepala yang berada di bahunya yang terekspos \"Kau membuat ku kaget Kyu!, apa kau sudah mandi?\" tanya Ryeowook dia tidak ingin terlambat ke pesta pernikahan kakak iparnya hanya karena suaminya yang belum mandi \"Hmmm, apa kau akan memandikan ku lagi Wook-ie?\" gumam Kyuhyun sebagai jawaban kalau dirinya sudah mandi, dan terlintas ide jahil untuk menggoda istri tercintanya. Sukses rona merah menyebar memenuhi pipinya dapat Kyuhyun lihat dari kaca di depanya. \"Ttt tidak kkkau sudah bbesar kkaau bisa mmandi sendiri Kkkyu!\" sial padahal Ryeowook sudah berusaha untuk tidak gugup tapi gagal. Membuat Kyuhyun terkikik geli. Sadar akan sesuatu yang ganjil Kyuhyun meneliti tubuh Ryeowook dari atas hingga bawah dan Kyuhyun dapat melihat keganjilan itu. \"kenapa kau memakai dress ini chagiya?, kau sengaja menggoda ku hemm? apa kau ingin aku memasukimu sebelum kita ke pernikahan noona ku? hmm?\" tanya Kyuhyun akan kejanggalan dari Ryeowook. Setelah Kyuhyun keluar dari kamar mandi dengan hanya melilitkan handuk di pinggangnya Kyuhyun belum melihat kejanggalan pada tubuh istrinya. karena Kyuhyun terpana akan kecantikan sang istri malam ini. Ryeowook memakai dress kemben pendek sepaha, dan itu sukses membuat nafsu kyuhyun kembali naik. Dan dapat Kyuhyun pastikan sepulang dari pernikahan noonanya Ryeowook akan lemas di buatnya. Ryeowook merasakan sesuatu yang keras menempel di pantatnya, dia sudah tau kalau nafsu suaminya meningkat lagi. \"Lalu aku harus memakai apa Kyu?, piyama untuk tidur?\" tanya Ryeowook lembut membalikkan badanya berhadapan dengan Kyuhyun dan itu membuat wajah mereka sangat dekat bahkan Ryeowook bisa merasakan terpaan nafas hangat Kyuhhun pada wajahnya benda keras di bawah sana semakin menusuk perut Ryeowook membuatbya merona \"hhhh aku hanya ingin terlihat sempurna di depan suami dan kakak ipar ku Kyu!\" Ryeowook menjawab pertanyaan yang ada di kepala suaminya menatap manik hitam yang sudah membuatnya terjerat dalam pesonanya. \"Hhh arra kalau begitu pakai stocking dan jacket Untuk menutupi tubuhmu yang terekspos Wook-ie!\" ujar Kyuhyun meniup leher istrinya lembut membuat leher Ryeowook meremang. setelah memberikan jawaban suaminya Ryeowook kembali memutar tubuhnya menghadap kaca. Ryeowook menggigit bibir bawahnya berusaha agar desahannya tidak lepas begitu saja. \"Kyuuuhhh, aku akan menghampiri pesta pernikahan bukan pesta bola salju, kenapa kau menyuruh ku memakai pakaian itu?\" tanya Ryeowook berusaha menetralkan jantungnya dan hawa panas yang kini mulai keluar dari dalam tubuhnya \"Karena leher iniih\" ucap Kyuhyun mendesah berusaha mrmbangkitkan gairah sang istri, mengeksplor leher jenjang putih milik Ryeowook seduktif dengan lidahnya. membuat Ryeowook lagi-lagi harus menggigit bibir bawahnya menahan desahanya agar tidak keluar dari bibir pinknya yang sialnya gagal \"Kyyuhhh\" \"Dada iniih\" Kyuhyun melanjutkan perkataanya dengan sedikit desahan, tanganya yang daritadi melingkar pada pinggang ramping Ryeowook kini beralih pada payudara Ryeowook yang hampir menyembul keluar. \"Kyuuuhhh\" sia-sia Ryeowook menahan desahannya sekuat mungkin tetap saja desahannya meluncur mulus tanpa bisa Ryeowook kendalikan. \"paha iniih\" lagi Kyuhyun menyebut yang menurutnya milik Wook-ie juga miliknya tangan satunya turun ke bawah membelai lembut paha Ryeowook bagian dalam hingga menyentuh vaginanya yang ternyata memang sudah basah. Memainkan bibir vagina istrinya yang memang sudah basah semakin basah dari luar celana dalam Ryeowok \"Kyyuuuuuh, eengghhh, sstooohhhppphhh\" Ryeowook tidak bisa menahan desahanya membiarkan semua desahanya meluncur begitu saja dari bibir tipis pink miliknya \"Walaupun hanya terekspos setengah semua itu milik ku Cho Ryeowook!, kau ingin kita berangkat atau kita tuntaskan sekarang?, hmm\" tidak beda jauh dengan Ryeowook Kyuhyun pun membiarkan desahanya lolos keluar dari bibir tebalnya. Ryewook yang mulai sadar akan perkataan Kyuhyun segera membalikkan badanya mengahadap Kyuhyun lagi. Lebih baik dia cari aman untuk malam ini. Wook-ie tidak ingin kakak iparnya akan memuntutnya karena tidak hadir dalam pesta pernikahanya. \"Ehm baiklah aku akan mencari dress lain yang lebih tertutup agar semua MILIKMU tidak terekspos, kau puas tuan Cho!\" dehem Ryeowook sebelum mengatakan bahwa dia menuruti permintaan sang suami \"Tentu saja nyonya Cho!, Kyu junior tidurlah lagi kau harus bersabar untuk nanti malam arra seo!\" jawab kyhyun mengelus lembut juniornya yang tengah tegang sedari tadi. Sesekali melirik Ryeowoook yang memerah akan ucapanya jangan lupa dengan smirk yang nghiasi wajah tampan pucatnya itu. \"eonni chukkae atas pernikahamu, kau sangat cantik dengan gaun ini Hyuk eonni!, emm mianhae aku terlambat!\" ujar Ryeowook penuh penyesalan, Eunhyuk yang tahu akan penyesalan adik iparnya mengangkat dagu Ryeowook dan menatapnya \"Eonni tau pasti Kyuhyun yang membuat kalian terlambat?, apa yang dia lakukan padamu Wook-ie?\" pertanyaan Eunhyuk sukses membuat pipi Ryeowook merona merah karena mengingat kejahilan tangan sang suami, dan Eunhyuk cukup tau dengan perubahan Ryeowook, karena Eunhyuk ataupun Jungsoo sangat hafal dengan tingkah dongsaeng mereka yang memang jahil dan mesum. Tidak jarang Jungso dan Eunhyuk menjadi sasaran kejahilan Kyuhyun. sedangkan di lain tempat Jungso, Donghae, Cho Yung Hwan dan Kim Hana tengah menemui kolega mereka. Kyuhyun menghampiri mereka dengan langkah pelan dan membuat semua yeoja yang berada di kebun belakang mansion Cho terpesona akan kharisma dan ketampanan yang Kyuhyun miliki \"Aaah appo, kenapa Jungso hyung menjewer telinga ku eoh?\" protes Kyuhyun pasalnya baru saja dirinya sampai sampai dan hyungnya sudah menjewer telinganya di depan para kolega sang appa tapi Kyuhyun tidak mau tahu akan semua itu. \"Jangan membuat para yeoja di pesta ini terpana karenamu Kyu?\" peringat Jungso pada Kyuhyun dan mendapat jawaban yang membosankan bagi hyung iparnya \"Tidak ada yang bisa menolak pesona ku hyung!, kau tau itu!\" jawab Kyuhyun penuh percaya diri \"kau sudah punya Wook-ie, jangan macam-macam Kyu!\" \"Jungso ah, Kyuhyun ah sudah hentikan jangan bertengkar di depan kolega appa!, Kyu turuti hyungmu atau appa akan memaksamu meneruskan Cho corp?, hmmm\" peringat Cho Young Hwan \"arraseo, mianhae!\" pasrah Kyuhyun menundukkan kepalanya. sebenarnya Kyuhyun sudah siap dengan banyak jawaban di kepalanya tapi kalau jawaban-jawaban itu membuatnya harua mengurus Cho Corp Kyuhyun akan lebih memilih diam. Kyuhyun suka akan pekerjaanya sekarang sebagai DETEKTIF. \"Tidak apa-apa tuan Cho, saya jarang melihat keakraban sesama saudara dan saya rasa anak-anak anda saling menyayangi!\" sahut salah satu kolega Cho Young Hwan tersenyum ramah. Yang di balas senyuman oleh Young Hwan \"saya akan memulai perkenalanya sekarang!\" pamit tuan rumah pada kolega yang berdiri di sekitarnya dan hanya di balas anggukann oleh presdir Kim dan kolega yang lain \"mohon perhatian sebentar!\" teriak Cho Young Hwan berusaha mengeluarkan suaranya sekeras mungkin, dan berhasil semua mata menatapnya. tidak terkecuali Ryeowook dan Eunhyuk pun mengalihkan pandangan mereka pada sang appa \"Saya akan mengumumkan beberapa hal mengenai Cho corporation Yang mulai besok akan di pegang oleh anak bungsu saya Cho Jungso, dan menantu saya Lee Donghae yang akan mulai belajar memegang tanggung jawab CH hotel, dan putra sulung saya Cho Kyuhyun yang akan menggantikan putri saya Cho Hyuk Jae untuk mengawasi kepolisian!, terimakasih dan selamat menikmati, jamuan pesta malam ini!\" pengumuman Cho ymYoung Hwan telah berakhir dan mendapat tepukan meriah dari para tamu pesta pernikahan anaknya. \"Appa, kalau aku jadi kepala polisi bagaimana dengan semua hasil karya ciptaan ku?, aku akan tetap turun tangan langsung pada kejahatan juga!\" bantahan Kyuhyun tidak bisa di tolak oleh Young Hwan. Karena sekeras apapun Young Hwan menolak permintaan anak sulungnya tetap tidak akan mengubah pemdirian seorang Cho Kyuhyun \"Hhh arraseo, tapi kau harus tetap bertanggung jawab pada kepolisian arra?\" Young Hwan menghela nafas pasrah sebelum memberikan persetujuan pada putra terakhirnya itu. satu tahun setelah penculikan Ryeowook, Kyuhyun melamar sang kekasih dan menikahinya, tapi karena Ryeowook belum ingin mempunyai anak malam pertama dan hubungan suami istri mereka seterusnya Kyuhyun di haruskan memakai pengaman, tidak beda jauh dengan Eunhyuk setelah Jungso memenjarakan Donghae dan untuk pertama kalinya Eunhyuk sangat ingin tau siapa yang berani menculik kekasih adiknya yang sangat keras kepala itu, Eunhyuk menatap Donghae dengan tatapan yang sulit di artikan bahkan hari-hari berikutnya Eunhyuk selalu menghanpiri Donghae hanya untuk mengobrol ataupun memastikan Donghae baik-baik saja. Tanpa dia sadari dirinya telah jatuh cinta dan Donghae pun telah melupakan Ryeowook yang sudah menikah dengan Kyuhyun dan lebih memilih Eunhyuk. yang dia tau sangat mencintai dirinya karena perhatianya. kalian tidak akan pernah tau apa yang terjadi di masa depan.

Para pekerja café tampak sibuk dari bagian dapur hingga pelayanan. Café tersebut selalu dipadati pengunjung, cafe tutup di sore hari karena itu memang jadwal tetap café tersebut. Sore pun datang menyisakan pemilik café dan dua orang pekerja café yang ada disana. \"Kalian telah bekerja keras hari ini, kalian bisa pulang sekarang\" \"Ne hyung kami pulang dulu\" seru Jimin yang sudah tidak sabar ingin pulang karna hari ini ia memiliki urusan lain. \"Tapi …\" \"Kau tenang saja hoseok~a aku yang akan menutup café. Kau dan Jimin pulang lah\" \"Ne kami pulang dulu Yesung hyung\" Hoseok dan Jimin berpisah di pertigaan jalan dekat café karna rumah mereka beda arah. Hoseok merasa ia akan mampir ke supermarket karna bahan dapur di apartemennya sedang kosong. Di supermarket Hoseok belanja ini itu, setelah itu ia pulang. Drrt drrt~ Hoseok merasa handphonenya bergetar ia melihat terdapat notifikasi pesan masuk. Hoseok membuka dan melihat siapa yang mengirim pesan. Ia tersenyum melihat siapa pengirimnya. Hoseok buru-buru membalas dan memasukkan kembali handphonenya ke saku karna saat ini ia sudah berada didepan pintu apartemennya. Klek~ \"Hah lelahnya.. ah ya apa dia sudah membalas ya?\" 'Hyungie' Read 'Ne' 'I miss you so bad' Hoseok terkekeh membaca balasan di handphonenya. Read 'Nado bogoshipeo' 'Hyung baru pulang kerja?' Read 'Ne, aku baru saja sampai di apartemen' 'Nanti malam kau ada acara?' 'Ani, wae?' 'Aku akan menjemputmu jam 7. Jadi bersiap-siaplah' 'Mau kemana?' 'Kau akan tau nanti Hyungie' \"Aish selalu saja tidak mau memberi tahuku akan kemana\" Cemberutnyanya. Ting Tong~ Suara bel menghentikan kegiatan sang pemilik apartement itu. Pintu terbuka menampilkan sosok Jungkook yang sudah datang padahal jam belum menunjukkan angka 7. Jungkook langsung saja memasuki apartemen Hoseok. Sebelum Hoseok melontarkan pertanyaan Jungkook sudah menjawabnya terlebih dahulu. \"Aku sengaja datang lebih awal, bogoshipoyo chagi\" Jungkook memeluk Hoseok sayang. Ia tahu apa yang akan ditanyakan kekasihnya itu. \"Eish kau ini\" 15 menit berlalu kini Hoseok telah siap, mereka pun pergi menuju tempat yang sudah direncanakan Jungkook. Selama perjalanan Jungkook sering melirik Hoseok, ia kagum dengan kecantikan Hoseok malam ini. Hoseok sampai dibuat malu karna dari tadi Jungkook sering meliriknya dengan tatapan itu. \"Kookie jangan lakukan itu, fokuslah kedepan saat menyetir\" \"Bagaimana aku bisa focus jika ada seorang malaikat disebelahku\" \"Eii..\" wajahnya memanas, Hoseok memalingkan wajahnya untuk menyembunyikan wajahnya yang memerah. Ia benar-benar senang sekaligus tersipu malu jika Jungkook sudah bertingkah seperti itu. Jungkook memarkirkan mobilnya di depan sebuah taman. Hoseok turun saat Jungkook membukakan pintu untuknya. \"Kenapa kita kesini?\" bukannya menjawab Jungkook malah tersenyum dan menggandeng tangan Hoseok. Mereka berjalan disekitar taman dan menuju ke sebuah pinggiran danau yang berada cukup dekat dengan taman itu. Hoseok terkejut melihat taman itu diubah menjadi ….. \"kapan kau menyiapkan ini semua?\" \"Duduklah dulu\" Sebuah alunan music klasik yang menambah kesan romantic malam itu. \"Kau tak perlu tau Hyung\" Jungkook menggenggam kedua tangan Hoseok lalu ia bersimpuh dengan satu kaki. Hoseok terkejut ia menatap balik Jungkook yang menatapnya penuh dengan ketulusan disana. Jungkook mengeluarkan sebuah kotak kecil berwarna biru dongker, ia membukanya dan menyodorkannya pada Hoseok, \"Mau kah kau menikah dengan ku Jung Hoseok?\" Hoseok menatap lekat mata Jungkook, ia mengangguk untuk mengiyakan. Jungkook memasang cincin tersebut di jari manis Hoseok, lalu ia berdiri dan Hoseok juga memasang cincin lain yang berada di kotak itu di jari manis Jungkook. Jungkook memeluknya dan Hoseok membalas pelukan Jungkook. Ia memejamkan matanya saat merasakan sebuah kecupan di keningnya. Kecupan turun ke mata kanan lalu ke mata kiri. Lalu turun lagi ke hidung, turun lagi ke pipi kanan lalu pipi kiri. Setelah itu turun ke dagu terakhir naik ke bibir. Ciuman yang awalnya hanya menempel kini jadi lumatan tanpa tuntutan apalagi nafsu. Di balik semak-semak agak jauh dari tempat mereka berdua terdengar suara bisik-bisik, namun suara itu tidak sampai ditelinga mereka berdua. \"Aigooo manis sekali. Apa kau akan melamarku semanis itu Namjoonie\" \"Aku pastikan itu sayang\" \"Taehyung~a\" Jin melihat Taehyung ngeri karna sejak tadi ia menampilkan smirk jahatnya. \"Kau melamun?\" \"aishh kau merusak lamunanku Hyung\" \"Apa yang kau lamunkan?\" Namjoon juga heran apa yang dilamunkan Taehyung sejak tadi. \"Aku sedang mengatur rencana bagaimana caranya aku merebut Jimin dari yoongi hyung, dan aku akan melamarnya lebih manis dan lebih hebat dari Jungkook\" \"astaga\" Namjoon cengo dan Seokjin tepuk jidat mendengar Taehyung yang mulai tidak waras.

Now come before I change my mind.\" Vincent was slowly walking up the stairs, after the house and all his work had burned down he was never the same. He refused to work most of the time, he did not kill along with his siblings, he was dead for a better lack of words. As he the top of the stairs he was greeted by the face's of his older brothers. Lester was offering him some deer, while Bo was just mumbling under his breathe something that he could not catch. He walked over to the ridge and took out some milk and went to the table to eat some ceral. \"Vincent you know that you should start to sculpute again, am pretty sure that mom would want you too.\" Lester was talking to his brother, he was trying to encourage Vincent. However, ever time that he was begining to help him get better, Bo always crashed him down. Vincent was just staring, he was listening, he had also wished that he could talk and have a full face. So why should I? Just so that it can be burned down again. Vincent was always constantly thinking, but it was to no use, no body ever tried to listen to what he had to say. The truth was that he could talk, but only in a low, scratchy, and whisper type voice. He was truly ashamed of his voice, so he never spoke. Instead, he just nodded. \"Good, I will go down later so that you can do your dog.\" Lester was smiling, his gaps was showing, he really wanted for Vincent to be happy. \"I just wanted to ask if you would like to come so that we can go get those two cute girls that are just camping up the road.\" Bo finally cut in. Vincent did not response nor did he nod. The truth was the he really did not want to kill, he never did, but Bo always told him that is what mother had wanted. So he followed, after all Bo was his older brother, and he could talk and be able to defend him. He loved his older brothers. With those words both Bo and Lester left the house in search of the two girls. -Down the Road- \"You see I told you that camping would not be so bad right?\" Spencer was telling her best friend, Quin. Spencer was beginning to put her stuff away. The 23 almost 24 year old was standing next to her best friend, Spencer was about average height, with light blue eyes, shoulder length dark brown hair, and was also very curvy. \"At least now you will shut up about me coming camping with you.\" Quin was telling her best friend. Quin was a week older than Spenc as she called her. She had light green eyes, with dark brown hair that almost hit her waist, she was also curvy but not as much as Spencer. The difference was that unlike Spencer, Quin loves to show off her body, to everyone. \"It was really fun though.\" \"Hey there ladies.\" Bo said as he walked up to in front of the girls. \"I was just wondering if you can just give me a ride back to my house, you see my car broke down, I live just a short while form here.\" \"Yeah sure thing.\" Quin said before she even talked to Spencer about letting his strange man into there car. The truth was the she found him kind of hawt. A/N: PLEASE COMMENT.[Chapter 2] I don't own the House of Wax. Sadly, however, it is an awesome moive. On with the story. \"You can just leave me here.\" Bo said once they the house. \"Unless you girls want to come in?\" Bo said as he winked at Quin. Quin just smiled. \"Of course.\" She then began to follow Bo into the house. \"Come on Spence, do not worry, just for a little while, we already ran away from home.\" This caused Bo to smile even more. Just then Lester came out, \"Hey Bo you finally came home. O I see that you brought some people with you.\" Spencer turned around to see the House of Wax. \"Wait can I go in there?\" She said pointing towards House of Wax. Lester and Bo looked at each other, \"Fine.\" Bo said without another word. Spencer then began walk towards House of Wax. Once inside the house was wax was grand, everything was made of wax, she began to touch the people, they felt so real. The house was huge, she eventually found herself in the kitchen. \"Wow.\" Spencer was walking around the kitchen, when she saw a figure, it looked truly alive. Spencer began to walk towards that figure. The figure seemed as if it had a wax face, it only had one eye, and a knife in its hand. She went to touch its face, the figure began backway. \"OMG am so sorry!\" Spencer felt ashamed more than fear. \"Why did not you move or say something?\" The figure only backway further. \"My name is Spencer, what is yours?\" The figure walked over to a painting that was signed Vincent, he pointed towards the name. \"Vincent?\" The figure nodded. \"Can you talk?\" The figure moved his head back and forth. \"Did you make all of this figures?\" Vincent nodded up and down. \"They are wonderful and beau.\" Vincent looked at her, \"French?\" He said in a very low voice, almost a whisper. \"Huh? Yeah.\" Vincent nodded. \"So are you related to that freak named Bo?\" Vincent looked start in the eyes, she had called Bo a freak, just like him, after all Bo was his older brother, his twin. He nodded. \"Is he older than you?\" Another head movement up and down. \"What about Lester? Is he older than you?\" Another head nod. \"So you are the youngest?\" Another nod. \"You know I like you, you are a good listener and a good responder. I like that in people.\" Vincent was smiling behind his mask, \"Friend?\" \"Yes!\" Vincent told her to follow him, she took her to her old workspace, \"This is where I make them.\" \"Wow, you know you are an artist. Your a really good at it.\" Spencer said looking at all the things that Vincent had laid in the entrie room. She noticed the bed in the small bed. \"Is that yours?\" A nod. \"It is really nice down here. It is quite.\" \"Thank you.\" Vincent said. \"And its clean!\" \"My mother taught me well.\" \"I think that I may have to spend the night, since my friend Quin is upstairs with Bo.\" \"You can here with me.\" \"I would like that, if you let me.\" \"It would be my pleasure.\" Spencer smiled and began to help Vincent with his scupulting.[Chapter 3] I don't own the House of Wax. Sadly, however, it is an awesome moive. On with the story. \"Vincent, where are we going?\" Spencer asked as Vincent held her eyes closed. \"Do not talk.\" Vincent replied. He had made her a beautiful sculpture, when she was sleeping. \"Open.\" Spencer opened her eyes to the most beautiful thing; it was a sculpture of her. \"Wow it is beautiful. Did you do this?\" Vincent was smiling on his inside. \"Yes. Do you like it?\" \"Of course, wow is so shocked. When did you do this?\" \"When were you sleeping. Sorry.\" \"Don't say that, it beautiful, it is an honor to have been sculpted by you.\" \"You are welcome. Are you hungry?\" \"Why yes, I was actually going to ask you if have seen Quinn?\" Vincent was fearing that she was going to leave him. \"No, are you leaving?\" \"Knowing Quinn we will be here until Bo leaves her or something.\" \"Good. Let us go get breakfast.\" \"Okay.\" Vincent and Spencer walked towards kitchen. \"Bo please. . . .\" Quinn was yelling, \"Am sorry.\" \"Just so that we are clear, you and your little friend now belong to me and my brothers, do you understand that?\" Bo said as he was touching Quinn's face with a knife. \"And you will do anything that I say?\" \"Yes. Yes. Please do not kill us.\" Quinn said as she was trying to get out the chair that Bo had her tied down. \"Good you are here forever and so is she.\" Bo said as he exited the room. \"Sleep tight my love, tomorrow we will have fun.\"[Chapter 4] The road was cold and lonely, but he took great comfort in the lone road it brought him great comfort and warmth. A feeling that was very unlike the one he received at home. Looking at the road he noticed an amorphous puddle to his left. A puddle that was created by the last night's quick shower that had caused him to stop his work and witness the comfortable noise that came from the rain. Upon closer inception the puddle revealed his monstrous face. How could any person, especially a woman, love and understand the pain hidden behind the wax face it hid behind of. Slowly moving his long black hair away from his monstrous face only to be greeted by the hallow socket, where his eye should have been. Quickly covering his half of the face he remembered that very early in the morning Bo and Lester had taken both of the girls to someplace far away, but they did not tell him where they were taking them. They both had taken Spencer, the one person that had talked to him but most importantly the one that had listened when he talked. But he did not know how she would react to his actual appearance. Bo always said that he was the only one that would understand him and love him for who he was and for what he looked like. However, there was something different now, there was Spencer and she cared and she had not run away as all the people before her did. Slowly getting up Vincent entered the house he was raised in. Going downstairs he began to work again, this time with a new found excitement. No longer was he working for what his mother wanted, but now for what he wanted.

A memory. A stolen moment. She lays beneathe him, her arms reaching out in welcome to grasp him to her breast. Here they are safe. Open. Honest. In love . She curls around him, arms and legs, body and soul. And imagines they were like this before, somewhere just as safe, and naked, and warm. She sees them entwining in the womb, nine months they were inseparable, and now a lifetime. She can entrust her heart to him because it has always been his. His to love, and break, and guard from the world. And she keeps his safe. Warm and cherished. Exactly how she feels with his arms around her. But when she wakes, she forgets the rightness of those feelings. She lies in her cold bed, her empty arms reaching across the distance to grasp nothing. And she cries. Whether from the loss of the dream, or the dream itself is a secret she keeps, and will probably never tell. Not to him. Sometimes not even to herself. But after her sobs quiet, and her tears have begun to dry on her pillow, she curls up around herself---and she dreams again. TBC...[Chapter 2] Gemini Kissing Carly + Nick By: L 0 K I Temperance He can't escapenher. Not when he's awake, and definitely not when he'snasleep. He imagines them in some place that doesn't exist. nA place outside the world. A place where they are free to benwho they want to be. He imagines that shenwants to be someone that loves him. His dreams are fullnof love . Devotion. Acceptance. The things hendesires so much. Her arms come around him, her lips soft, hernhand gentle upon his head. Chaste. Virtuous. nTemperate. She's an angel mixing volatile emotions. But he knows she'snno angel. The other half of his soul---she can't be. nHis dreams are full of passion. Her hot voice fills his ear,npleas and promises, and breath to tie it all together. Her legsntrap his hips, pushing and pulling, and rolling together like twonanimals in heat. But when he'snawake...when he's awake, sometimes he tries to push his mind as farnas it can go. Because he can. Because he wants to see ifnhe can find a breaking point. So far he hasn't. He disguises hisnthoughts. With anger, sarcasm, indifference. All thenthings he knows she hates in him. He does it because shenreacts, because it blinds her to seeing beyond, and seeing the truthnthat festers deeper inside of him. But sometimes he'snmasochistic; sometimes he drops the mask, the rebellious youthnlashing out. He opens his eyes, and a door, and he lets her in,nlets her glimpse the truth she seems to so desperately want... Because he can . nBecause he wants to see if he can find her breaking point. So far he hasn't. She raises her shieldnof confusion, of ignorance. She stands at the door but refusesnto take that last step in. But sometimes he catches hernoff-guard. She sees that look and doesn't flinch, doesn'tngive him innocence and ignorance. She is Eve in those moments,nunafraid and tasting of the apple of knowledge. She is open. nHonest. But in the nextnsecond she always closes down. And he wonders if she is also andoor. If she hides behind it wanting to be safe from him, or ifnshe presses her face against it and wishes he would break in and freenher. He wonders if she even knows the answer herself. If she's hiding the same thing. TBC...[Chapter 3] Gemini Kissing Carly + Nick By: L 0 K I Arch She knows, but she won't let herself think about it. She thinks the consequences of those thoughts would be far more dangerous than the thoughts themselves. It taunts her. If there is nothing there, then what does she fear? She fears that there will be something there . She fears that thinking about it will allow the thought to take root, and then there will be something there. She fears him. She doesn't want to look at him differently, but she knows she already does. She's wary of him now. She second-guesses all of his actions. And she personalizes everything. She knows it's insane, but she can't seem to help it. She thinks: Is this because... She won't ever finish those thoughts. At least, she hopes she won't. Wishes or curses---she knows they will lead her somewhere. She has no idea where, or even if good or bad. She knows only that it will be a point of no return. Absolutes scare her. Ask her if she loves him. The answer is always 'yes'. Vehement. Heartfelt. But there is hesitance. Not in the emotion itself, or even in her voice. But it's always there, and she can't understand it. She never hesitated when they were children. So much has changed since they were children. She fears how much she needs him---and she wonders---has she always needed him so much? She likes to tell herself it's Ambrose. After she woke from that nightmare---he was the only one. The only one she could lean on, the only one who could comfort her. The only presence that would let her sleep. He gets her through the day, and the horror, and the loss---but she fears it's not enough anymore. They are two halves of an arch, holding each other up. So she won't pull back, because she doesn't think she can stand without him. And she won't let go---because she can't stand to watch him fall. There is a danger in becoming so dependant on another. It's even worse when another is so dependant on you. At the same time--- they make a shelter from the world. True or not, that is what her heart, and body, and maybe even her soul tells her...Together, they are...safe? (She won't let herself think about it.) But enough time has passed, not healing the pain, but dulling it somehow, and she can think beyond safety . Can think of life, and not just existence. And she wants more. She wants to...connect. It's in those half-thoughts. The breath of hesitance. She could... He could... They could... And so the fear persists. This fear of herself. TBC...[Chapter 4] Focus What he fears…isn't so noble. He doesn't fear himself, and he doesn't fear her. He fears that things will stay the same. He fears that they will go back to the way they were before. And he can't go back. He feels like he's stuck in place. Close to her but not as close as he wants to be. He's afraid that if he reaches out to her, she will slip away. At the same time- He can't let her go. It isn't Ambrose. He knows that. It was hell, but it didn't create this . All it did was hone his desire into focus. It taught him patience. And caution. And that Carly is just as possessive of him as he is of her. What it didn't teach him was, what exactly that meant to her. Does she lie to herself? Has she been painting her world in shades of denial? Or... She's been quiet around him lately. Almost...wary. Does she realize exactly what has changed? Does she fear his feelings? Or does she fear her own? ","Summary":" There are no excuses or apologies here. If you do not like twincest / incest then go no further. Hi"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"What Could Have Happened","Author":"WolverinesDarlin","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6204368","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I do not own this movie or its characters. This is purely for entertainment purposes only. Just a thought I had while watching the scene where Vince was… erm… \"preparing\" Wade. Anyway… enjoy. HouseofWax \"Wade?\" Carly whispered. She had snuck into the house when she had seen the broken headlight. She had thought of beeping the horn to get him out faster but decided against it, feeling that that would draw unwanted attention to herself. She didn't trust this man anymore. She had snuck upstairs when she heard noise in the kitchen, not wanting to bump into the same man that could very well be more than pissed at her and her friends. \"Wade? We gotta go… c'mon. Where are you?\" She whispered again. She looked around in the hallway and picked a room on her right, she went in and looked around. She didn't want to turn on the light so she walked around in the dark, waiting impatiently as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. \"Wade!\" She whispered harshly, \"Where the hell are you?\" She slipped a little in something wet and decided to turn on the light, she didn't want to slip or bump into something and creat noise. She felt along the wall until she found the switch then looked back to the ground and bit back her scream. A rather large pool of blood was on the ground, it smeared and made a trail to the middle of the floor. She followed and found a trap door in the floor. \"Oh my god.\" She opened the door and looked in. It was lit up dimly. She looked behind her and jumped inside. She followed the hallway slowly, looking behind her every 5 seconds on the second. She passed a panel with a bunch of switches and made note of it, so she could get out and not get too lost. She walked forward, making sure she didn't make too much noise, trying desperately to keep her breathing quiet. Something was wrong, she could feel it. She looked behind her again, not seeing anyone, just an empty hallway. She came up to a more open area and froze when she saw a man with long hair standing in front of a table. She gasped at the sight of him and covered her mouth and took two steps back and hid behind a wooden brace. The man didn't seem to hear her, Carly peeped around the pole and looked back into the room. There were clothes and shoes littering the floor, Carly gasped again when she realized Wade was wearing those same shoes and the shirt that was on the ground. The man walked around the table to the other side revealing a body that was on the table. Wade was the body, he didn't have any clothes on, and he wasn't moving. She didn't see any restraints, why was Wade letting this man do whatever he was doing? Oh god… is he dead? Her breathing hitched in her throat. No… no no no. Wade suddenly seemed to struggle moans escaped his lips as he tried to move his arm, draping it over his own chest. But it was done lazily, like he didn't have much control. The man took Wades arm away and laid it back down to his side. At least he's alive…. Wade seemed to cry in frustration, what was wrong with him? The man left leaving to a back room, away from the table… and Wade. Carly saw this as a chance and all but sprinted up to the table, leaning over her love. Her brain barely registered the dog lying on the bed, the same one that had near scared the shit out of Wade earlier. \"Wade… Wade can you hear me?\" Wade responded with several moans and tears. \"Sshh, Wade. What's wrong with you? Can you move at all?\" Wade moved his head side to side lazily. \"Wade what did he do to you?\" Another moan, only his facial expressions working for him. Carly furrowed her brows and looked at him, she ran her hand over his hair soothingly, letting her fingers to run through the strands. \"I'm gonna get you out of here.\" She whispered. She looked him up and down and when she saw his shoulder winced, was that where the blood came from? She looked down his legs too but didn't see anything till she saw his foot. \"Damn it.\" She muttered, What did this bastard do to him? Carly wrapped her arms around his torso gently, getting him off this table and out of her the only thing in her mind. He moaned in pain and she stopped, \"I'm sorry. I didn't…\" She stopped whispering, she heard a door close and looked behind her for a second before looking back at Wades terrified face. \"I'll come back for you. I promise. I'm not going to leave you.\" She stroked the side of his face and kissed him on the lips gently before she hid behind a curtain that was hanging on the wall. She was shocked that the dog wasn't barking or growling at her, which would have gotten her caught. Wade followed her with his eyes, waiting until she was completely out of sight to stop looking after her. Half of him wanted her to run for her life, to get out of there. The other half begging her to save him. He loved her with all of his heart, and to see her now was like seeing an angel. The man with the long hair walked in the room with a bowl, he placed it down on the small table next to Wades head and stirred it with some sort of tool. Wade's breathing picked up and he seemed to move his head further away from the mans touch, trying to escape whatever he was trying to do to him. The man held Wades chin to keep him in place, and with his other hand dipped the tool into the bowl, pulling out a sappy residue. Carly watched from behind the curtain helplessly. She looked around the rest of the room for some sort of weapon she could grab easily, she looked back when Wade made a sort of whining noise. She wondered what the man had done so that Wade couldn't function properly. The man started to put the residue onto Wades face, covering his eyesbrows and facial hair with the sticky mess. When the man pulled a cloth out and started to pull it over Wades face she understood, it was wax. Carly stared in horror as the man pressed the cloth down onto Wades eyebrows firmly doing the same thing around his mouth. Wade screamed and groaned when the man suddenly ripped the cloth away from Wades face, taking his eyebrows and facial hair with it. Wade continued to try and resist the man as he wiped Wade down with a wet cloth, getting rid of the stickness that was no doubt covering his face. Her heart clenched as Wade tried, again, to move. He moved his arm again towards the evil man but again, his strength failed him, not allowing him to do more than move it over his chest and let it fall. The man didn't move Wades arm back this time though, instead bringing Wades broken and naked body up in his arms bridal style. Wade fell limply in his arms, his head falling back and bouncing side to side as the man carried him to the back room he had retreated to earlier. Carly followed behind them watching again from an out of sight area as the freak carried her loving boyfriend away from her and into a morbid looking chair. As the man got Wade \"situated\" Carly backed away into the other room with the dog, looking for something to use against the man who was creating a nightmare for the both of them. She found a wrench laying on a far counter, and grabbed it hurridly. She ran back to the other room and stopped at the doorway, assessing the sitation. The man was away from Wade now, Wade sitting in the chair with a harness around his head. Carly scrunched her face up, throughly ready to tear the man limb from limb. Glad now that she had decided to go in and get Wade rather than honk a horn. From how he was already stripped and stitched up, she assumed he had been down here for a while. Carly twirled the tool in her hand, the evil, freak, of a man started to turn a bunch of knobs. Carly saw this as her chance to take him out and walked quickly but quietly behind him. Thanking god silently for her ability to \"Ghost\" others so well. She came up right behind the man and hit him on the side of the head. Once he had started to bend down she hit him again over the top of the head, blood covered the top of the wrench. She dropped her weapon next to the mans head and went over to where Wade sat in the chair. She looked at the head harness and ran her fingers over the several joints and areas that looked like it should collapse or come apart at but didn't see how. Instead she moved to his wrists and other areas, gently pulling them away from where they were laid and put his hands in his lap. Wade moaned again, moving ever so slightly, staring behind her. Carly spun around on her heel and looked behind her, a bloody mess staring at her. She screamed and ducked out of the way as he swung the same wrench at her, she heard it collide with Wades knee, he groaned at the pain, whatever was wrong with him preventing him from screaming. She screamed again as the man continued to follow her around the room, she looked around the room terrified at the amounts of wax and surgical tools. She grabbed an old and un used pipe and held it out in front of herself defensivly. When he got close she swung, the pipe connecting with his hand, knocking the wrench away. She advanced and swung the pipe at his face, knocking him over on a nearby table. She hit him again on the back, he grunted in pain but she followed it up with another blow to the skull, causing more blood to pulse from the already bleeding mans skull. She ran back to Wade and started to pull at the head harness. She felt around some more and felt a clasp at the back of his head and pulled at it. The harness popping free. She pulled his feet away from where they were placed and pulled him off the chair. His weight took her by surpise since he, currently, was just dead weight. He fell in a heap on the ground, she fell with him and held his body close to her for a second, enjoying the feeling of his chest rising and falling against her own chest and his breath tickling her neck; his face buried in her neck, he was alive. \"I'm getting you out of here.\" She said determined. She started to sit up straighter, bringing his right arm around her neck, his left arm injured. Once she had brought them up to a semi standing position she wrapped her left arm around his waist for support and proceeded to half drag half carry her terrified boyfriend away from this torture chamber. HouseofWax Wade wanted to palm himself over and over. He just couldn't get his body to work, no matter how hard he tried. Carly was practically carrying him to safety and all he was managing was moaning and being a dead weight. The drug was some major stuff, he remembered it started with an \"O\", he could hardly even think straight let alone move something. They neared the end of the hallway and up to a trap door. She propped him up against the hallway wall as she climbed up the stairs and opened the door. She looked around the room for a second before she came back down for him. She threw his arm around her shoulders and wrapped her own arm around his waist and again carried him up the stairs and into a rather bright room. Wade pinched his eyes shut at the sudden brightness. He felt himself get brought to a hard surface and he opened his laid him down on the ground gently, holding his head separate as she lowered his head to the floor gently. She stood up quickly and moved to a large chest. She grabbed a handle on one of the sides and then dragged it over to the top of the trap door. She opened the chest and started filling it. It obviously had stuff in it already since it was filled after only a few stacks of books and a couple of small statues. \"Listen to me Wade.\" She said quietly, but not as quiestly as when they had been \"downstairs\". Look at me.\" She said gently. He looked her straight in the eye. She was kneeling over him but had also bent in close to his face, so that he could feel her breath. \" I'm coming back for you. I'm going to go see that the house is clear alright?\" He moaned his protest, she couldn't leave him. What if that man came back… \"Wade, sshh. Listen to me. I won't let him take you again. If he's ever to take you from he he'd have to pry you away from my dead cold arms. Just.. don't make a sound. I'll be back before you know it.\" She kissed him gently on the forhead and then left the room. Wade looked around the room, just waiting for something to grab him and drag him away again. He remembered what she said about having to pry him away from her dead arms… he didn't want it to come to that. He didn't want her to go through what he had… or almost did. Wade closed his eyes, feeling it was better not to see it coming since he couldn't do anythign about it anyway. He about jumped out of his skin when something touched him though, he opened his eyes and sighed when he saw Carly. \"Sorry baby… I found some clothes…\" She showed him the clothes. \"The house is clear.\" Wade watched and felt as Carly slipped her hand under his neck and back and pulled him into a sitting postion, she made sure he was secure, his head resting on her shoulder as she dressed him. Starting with a black button up shirt, one arm after the other and then buttoning it up. She lowered him back down to the floor gently and started to pull on some pants, jeans. They actually fit. He wondered, in horror, if these were the clothes of the bastard who had kidnapped him. Though he'd rather be clothed than naked. Carly finished by putting a single boot on his left foot, not putting one on his right. He remembered his cut tendon and thanked her in his mind. He winced when she did put a sock over his foot though, it brushed his wound for only a moment though. Once carly finished she looked at him again and brought him back to a sitting postion, he felt like a rag doll, unable to move or do anything. His head lolled back for a second before she brought it back up to a proper position. She brought his head to her shoulder and let him rest there for a moment. She whispered that she loved him and that she was sorry. She had no reason to be sorry, she had just saved his life. He knew she was saying it more as sympathy than because she felt responsible… but still. Carly rose her hand from his chest to the side of his face, rubbing her thumb up and down his cheek lovingly. Wade sighed in relief, happy to be in the arms of the one he loved… safe. \"You're gonna be alright now…\" She whispered in his ear, his head still resting on her shoulder. Slowly, but gently, she rose to stand, bringing the limp man up with her. They resumed their stance, with his good arm around her shoulders and her other arm around his waist. Slowly and carefully they made their way out. As they were nearing the door to the hallway the room resounded with a large bang, Carly looked behind her, Wade couldn't his head was hanging, his chin touching his chest rather than even able to look forward. She gasped and picked up her pace, as more banging continued. Wade desperately told his legs to work and help Carly for once instead of her doing all of the work. She made her way down the stairs when suddenly there was a loud crash from upstairs. HouseofWax Carly tore the door open and dragged Wade through with her. She saw the truck and sighed, but the froze. If the house was empty earlier… but the truck was still there, implying that the gas station guy never left… Carly shook off the bad feeling and open the passenger door and got Wade in and put the buckle on. She ran to the other side and got in the drivers and right as she turned on the ignition the man she had beat to the ground burst through the first door, blood still caked on his face, hair and all down his neck and shirt. Wade groaned, his head finally straight up, able to see out the windshield as well. Carly squealed and put the truck in reverse and slammed on the accelerator. The truck went in full reverse down the driveway. They got onto the road and she put it in gear and started to go forward. Carly looked around and slammed on the brakes when the whole town started to light up. \"What in gods name...\" She looked around as sounds and lights came on, making the town look alive rather than abandoned. She looked at Wade and then back to the outside world. \"The church!\" She shouted and got out of the truck. She went around to the other side and got Wade out, they got into the church and she realized that the church was just how it was before, with the pastors look all the way to the people still sitting exactly where they were before. \"Oh god…\" She kept walking forward bringing Wade with her, she accidently bumped a womans hand which immediately fell of and crashed onto the ground, revealing a real person underneath the wax. \"Oh my god!\" Carly screamed. She stared at the arm on the floor, this was what they were gonna do to Wade, embalm him in wax. She looked at the recorder on the floor, repeating whispers and a coughing noise repeatedly. She looked around at the blank stares of those who once were just as terrified as herself and Wade. She looked at Wade, sharing the terrified look, him reflecting her face and look of terror. She heard shuffling on the front stairs, she jumped and dragged her boyfriend to a closet and set him down. \"I'll be back.\" She kissed him on the lips and left him sitting in an upright position on the closet floor before she left and closed the door behind her. Carly ran and hid under the pastors robe and curled up into a ball, doing her best to regulate her breathing, trying to be silent. She heard somebody walk next to her but then back down. She started to relax a little when suddenly somebody grabbed at her, she ran from under the robe and out the front door, hoping he follows her, leaving Wade alone. HouseofWax Okay, I have another chapter kinda planned. But I dunno if anyone is even gonna read this. So I'm not gonna go any further until I'm told by at least three ppl. Hope you like it, use your imaginations as to what happens after this. Please review. Thank you.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own House of Wax or anybody in it. Enjoy! X.x.X.x Carly screamed, kicking and punching as the man pulled her out of the church. He was not the same man as the one who had taken Wade but was the man from the gas station. \"LET ME GO! LET GO!\" She screamed. She managed a good blow to his jaw and he released her. She bolted away from him and ran further into the streets but tripped and landed inside a small garden, within moments the abusive man was on top of her and grabbing at her once more. All Carly could do was slap at the man's chest and shoulders, futile attempts compared to his powerful blows and strong grip. He pulled her to her feet and dragged her back into the gas station across the street. She stumbled around next to him as he turned on his radio, blaring scream-o music. She wanted to cover her ears to shelter her from the loud noise but couldn't. The music seemed to shake the entire station with its base, it added a horrifying twist to her impending doom, she felt that her life was now over and it terrified her. He slammed her into a chair that reminded her of one that was normally in a dentist office and she screamed, flailing her arms and legs to try and prevent him from tying her down. \"No! Let me go! WADE!\" She screamed, she knew deep down that he wasn't able to come to her rescue but she screamed none the less. \"SOMEBODY HELP ME!\" She screamed. To her dismay he managed to tie her wrists down with the leather straps, reinforcing them with duck tape. When he moved down to her legs to tie them down as well she kicked out, catching him in the jaw. He stumbled backwards and she gasped when blood filled his mouth, he had bitten his tongue. \"Bitch!\" He exclaimed and advanced on her once again. This time managing to hold her legs down, he wrapped her ankles in duck tape, making kicking a lame attempt to do anything. \"SOMEBODY HELP ME!\" Just as she had screamed those three useless words they became less useless. Her brother… her wonderful, amazing, brother and Dalton came into view on the grate above. \"Hello?\" Dalton called, \"Anybody here? Carly…? Wade…?\" Carly got ready to cry out again but was met with a sweaty, dirty, palm over her mouth. Making her cry for help just muffled screams. She watched helplessly as Nick seemed to lose interest in the station and start to walk away, with him her hope of escaping. Carly felt the man behind her leave for a small second and when he came back he had something in hand. She looked up and followed him with her eyes, trying to get an idea what he was going to do. A small glue tube was in his hand and she freaked when he grabbed her from under her chin and held her still. \"No… what are you doing?\" \"Sshh… it's okay… it's okay.\" He 'soothed' his voice and breath on her ace gave her chills all up her body. He slowly placed the glue over her lips when she drew them into a tight line. He brought his lips up to her face, dreadfully, close and blew over them sensually. He pulled back and walked away towards the door. Carly looked away from him and let out a strangled cry, the sound of the door shutting made her jump and looked back at the door. He was gone. Carly looked around and started to breath heavily, trying to find a way to get out of this mess. Her wrists hurt and she wanted to open her mouth but it was futile to try. Slowly she began to twist her arm around to try and escape her restraints. X.x.X.x Wade stared down at his left foot and squinted his eyes at it. Move ! He urged himself. Just fucking move already! He was starting to lose his mind. Carly hadn't come back yet… something happened to her and he needed to get his immobile ass in gear if she was going to be saved. He'd be damned if what that man did to him did it to Carly. He let out a strangled cry when nothing happened. He was able to move his head now but that wasn't enough to save Carly. He leaned his head back against the wall and let out a frustrated sigh. He looked back at his legs and glared at his own limps. \"MOVE!\" He shouted and gasped when he realized he could move his tongue and speak properly. Progress. He grinned a little before focusing on his body once more. \"C'mon Wade… Carly needs you. Move your sorry ass and save her.\" He told himself quietly, determined and growing angry. He huffed when he still couldn't move his own foot but just as he was about to quit his left foot twitched. His eyes widened and he tried again, moving his foot back and forth. \"That's it.\" He whispered. Within just a few more minutes of working he was able to move all of his limps, slowly he pushed himself up the wall; he leaned on it heavily to keep himself upright, his legs felt like jell-o… as if he'd been on a boat for weeks and was just now stepping onto land once more. He took a step forward but without the wall his legs buckled under him and he crumbled to the closet floor. \"Fuck.\" He cursed under his breath. It wasn't helping that his right foot his burning like hell fire and that his left knee was heavily bruised… or worse shattered. He sat down on his ass and pulled himself back to the wall using his arms, doing a half ass looking 'crab walk'. Once he was sitting against the wall again he repeated the process; pushing himself up the wall and waiting till he felt strong enough to try again. This time he was able to hold himself up, once he got to the door he held himself up a little with the door handle as he opened it. As the door swung open with a small squeak he cringed and froze, he could have sworn that anybody in the entire town would have heard that. But when nothing came of his loud entry back into the world he sighed and relaxed a little. He kept his right hand on the door frame and the other on the door handle, his left shoulder was hurting like crazy but he fought past it and took his first few steps out of the closet, relying heavily on the half wall that surrounding the church stage. With each limping step he took he would move one hand in front of the other on the railing, looking much like one would if they were climbing a rope. He made his way slowly down the stairs and into the main aisle, trying to ignore the frozen faces of once living people. He felt chills run down his spine and shivered, is that what was supposed to happen to me? As he walked down the aisle he leaned against the pews as he walked until he got to the door. He pushed the massive thing open and looked outside, across the street he saw Nick and Dalton… just as he was stepping outside Dalton took off, leaving Nick to walk around the gas station alone. He stumbled down the stairs and limped as fast as his broken and recently drugged body would allow him. \"Nick!\" He called out desperately. Nick turned around and faced him, \"Wade? What the hell? Where's Carly?\" He shouted across the street. \"I dunno… they took her!\" He shouted back, he continued to go as fast as he could and sighed in relief when Nick left his place at the gas station to come see what the problem was. \"What the hell happened to you?\" He asked as they met halfway. Nick put a hand on his shoulder and he cried out. \"Fuck what the hell?\" Nick asked in surprise at his pain. \"This is a fucking freak show. The two guys are freaks. Everything and everyone is wax.\" He said throught gritted teeth, waiting for the pain to subside. \"And they got Carly.\" Nick cursed, just then a man exited the gas station. \"Holy fuck… he's the one who started this whole mess.\" Wade said under his breath, Nick turned around to face the man. \"Hey you guys need some help?\" The man called out. X.x.X.x Nick turned around to look at Wade again; gave him a look and shrugged. \"Yeah we're looking for my sister. You seen her around?\" He shouted across the street. \"I dunno… what's she look like?\" The man asked, running a hand down the side of his face as he walked over; Nick couldn't ignore the blood that stained his teeth and the bruise on his cheek. \"Red head, short and small.\" He described vaguely as the man stopped in front of him. \"Yeah no. Haven't seen her since I took the two of them up to the house.\" He said, indicating to Wade behind him. Nick looked over his shoulder to see Wade look like he was about to pass out. He knew he couldn't trust this man, but he figured is he 'pretended' to trust he wouldn't hurt them until they were truly vulnerable. \"Wade's a little beat up. There a hospital or doctor we can go see?\" he asked looking back at him. \"Not that's open right now, but I have some medical supplies up at the house… I could take a look at him for ya.\" He offered. Nick clenched his teeth together but offered a small smile, \"That would be great.\" The man nodded and offered his hand, \"Name's Bo…\" Nick took it and shook it hard, \"Nick.\" \"This way Nick.\" He said as he started to turn back for the station, a truck in the driveway. Nick turned to face Wade and frowned at how pale he was looking. \"Dude.\" He said as he walked up to him and put his right arm over his shoulders, \"What did they do to you.\" Slowly they started to follow Bo when Wade spoke up. \"What are we doing? This guy took Carly. And totally got me fucked…\" \"Did he do this to you?\" \"No… another guy… he was up at the house.\" He muttered and cursed when he tripped on his own feet. Nick held him up and waited until Wade had regained some control before he continued, \"Well maybe he took Carly up there, we'll find her and Dalton and get the hell out of here.\" \"I hope he didn't take Carly up there.\" Wade said and was about to continue when Carly's voice resonated from somewhere below them. \"NICK! WADE! I'm down here! Help me!\" Carly screamed. Bo spun around to face them, his eyes wide. \"FUCK!\" Wade and Nick both screamed. Nick released Wade and got in defensive stance as Bo pulled out a knife and started to charge. Wade made a break for the door, looking for a door that would lead him to Carly. Nick made dodges and shots at the already beat up crazy and when he got a chance he ran into the station as well. Bo tried to push the door open but Nick locked it and when he made a break for the garage door Nick retaliated and jumped on the opening door and locked it with a screw driver. Bo growled and glared at him from the other side of the glass door before getting into his truck and leaving. \"Wade?\" He called. \"Over here!\" He replied. Nick ran around the station until he found Wade standing in front of a old wooden door; he was leaning against the door jam with his shoulder, his head leaning on the wooden door frame. \"It's locked.\" He said pathetically, he looked terrible. Nick nodded, \"Stand back.\" Wade stumbled away from the door and stood beside Nick as he charged it and kicked it open. \"Wade? Nick!\" She called again. Nick waited until Wade went down first before following close behind, ready to catch Wade if he lost his balance. X.x.X.x Wade opened the door at the bottom of the stairs and cursed when he saw Carly. \"Aw shit Carly.\" He mumbled as he limped up to her. She was tied to a chair, one of her hands were loose, still strapped to the bar but she could move it around. Her lips were stained red with blood. \"Wade\" She whispered his name. The way she said it made him feel on top of the world, she said it as if his name was a gift. \"Carly… did he do this to you?\" He asked, thinking of Bo made him sick. She nodded. \"Yeah… where is he?\" When nobody answered for a moment she repeated it, \"Where is he!\" \"Gone.\" Nick said as he looked out the door and back upstairs, making sure nobdy was coming. Wade started to pull off the tape and restraints around her wrists but his fingers fumbled with the buckles, his hands shaking too much. Nick noticed he was having a difficult time with them and pulled him away gently. \"Sit.\" He ordered the dying man. Wade protested at first but gave in quickly and sat down in a chair in the corner. Nick made quick work of her restraints. \"What did they do to Wade?\" He asked her as she rubbed her wrists once they were free. As soon as Nick had freed her legs she jumped out of the chair and fell to her knees next to Wade. \"Wade? Baby…? Are you alright?\" She asked, taking his left hand in both of hers gently. Wade looked to her wearily and nodded. \"Just a little drained is all.\" He offered a small smile that looked more like a grimance which made her wince as she rubbed small circles on the top of his hand with her thumb. She nodded somberly, her face the image of sympathy. \"Well they stabbed him… they also drugged him and were going to turn him to wax… like the rest of the town.\" She summed up the past hour for her brother, answering his question. \"Fuck.\" Nick cursed. For the first time he noticed that Wade no longer had his facial hair, no eyebrows… nothing. \"We gotta get him out of here… he's not looking so good.\" Carly nodded as she stroked the side of his face gently. \"He's lost a lot of blood.\" Wade closed his eyes and leaned his head into her palm, enjoying the feeling of having Carly close to him again. Nick shook his head and stepped in front of Wade and snapped his fingers in his face. \"You can't go to sleep Wade.\" He told him. Wade snapped his eyes open and nodded. \"Yeah.\" Carly sighed and stood up, placing a gentle kiss on his lips, \"Let's get out of here.\" \"We need to find Dalton.\" Nick said as they all stood and started to make their way up the stairs. Wade leaning on Carly for support, glad that she wasn't doing all the work anymore. They had made it past the parking lot and were about to step back into the street when Wade shook his head and stopped. \"I can't keep going… I can't.\" \"Wade?\" Carly asked as she looked over to him, \"Wade no!\" She shouted as Wade started to sink to the curb, \"Wade you can't quit…\" \"I'm just going to slow you down anyway…\" he mumbled. Carly sank down in front of him, so that they were level; she stared right into his eyes and he felt as if she were peering into his soul. \"Carly don't make me do this. Please don't… just look at me-\" \"I am.\" She said. \"And I see a strong man that, if any other person were put in this position, could have quit long ago from the injuries and drugs but didn't. Don't quit now Wade… I need you.\" She said, bringing a hand up to the side of his face. \"We're gonna find a doctor's office… and we're going to get you some... VERY powerful painkillers.\" She told him, smiling a little. She was so beautiful and so incredible… she's been dragging his sorry ass around from the very beginning… even though he was an asshole she still loved him enough to come for him, to keep him going; and here he was, quitting. She had been chased down and tied up, had her lips glued shut and gone through terrifying horrors… and all along she had wanted to leave in the first place. They were in this mess because of him. He sighed and brought his own hand to her chin and rubbed his finger up and down her jaw line. \"Alright. I'm coming.\" She grinned and leaned in close to him and kissed the corner of his mouth before she wrapped her arms around his neck gently, the side of her face next to his. \"We'll find you some painkillers, get Dalton and get the HELL out of here.\" She said as she pulled back and kissed him again and stood. Nick walked up behind her and offered a hand to the pale looking man. Wade looked up at the two of them and took the offered hands and they pulled him to his feet. X.x.X.x Oh mah gawd… second chapter. I'm sorry it took so long, I lost inspiration to write this… and then I got caught up with school and work… it was chaos… but here it is! I hope it was alright for you all. Please review. I will be updating soon. Thanks.[Chapter 3] Enjoy! X.x.X.x Nick busted in the door to the police office down the road from the church and gas station and looked around; the lights were on revealing the frozen faces of wax figures. There were two officers standing in a corner, 'talking' to one another while one held a cup of coffee the other was using his hands to describe his story. There was also a single officer standing behind the reception desk directing a civilian down a hall to the left of them. Carly gasped and looked away, tightening her grip around Wade who returned the gesture by squeezing her shoulder with his good hand. Nick was taking lead since he had both hands free, while Carly was helped Wade walk. They had assumed their usual positions, with Wade's right arm around her shoulders, and her left arm wrapped around his waist. Wade was growing more and weaker with fatigue from both blood loss and the pain he had to fight through. \"This way\" Nick muttered as he turned into a hall to their left, the hall the officer was pointing to. Carly and Wade were about to take a step when his legs buckled under him. \"Wade!\" She cried as the two of them fell to the floor. Nick whipped around and ran back to them, to find Carly kneeling on the floor holding Wade's shaking body in her arms. \"What happened?\" He asked as he crouched next to them. \"I dunno!\" She said panicked; brushing his hair back. Wade looked at Nick desperately, Nick felt chills run up his arms and neck as he looked into his eyes. He looked so weak and empty, it was scary to see anybody like this but to see his friend like this was more so. \"We gotta do something.\" He whispered. Carly looked over to Nick her eyes glistened with tears. \"But what?\" Nick looked up at Carly then over his shoulder into the hallway behind them. \"We find the infirmary and get him some epinephrine maybe some antibiotics.\" He said as he looked back down at Wade's pale face, it wasn't helping that he didn't have any eyebrows, which just added to the morbid-ness of his situation. Carly nodded and then looked at Wade again, \"C'mon… let's get you up.\" She said quietly. \"I can't… it's too hard.\" He replied; his voice was raspy and tired, it didn't even sound like Wade any more. Nick shook his head, \"No bullshit, Wade! Man up and get past this. You're not out of this yet!\" He said, trying to get a rise out of the man to get his blood pumping a little. \"You're being a pussy.\" He seemed to get a rise out of the wrong person. \"Nick you dick!\" Carly shouted. \"You have NO idea what he's gone through…!\" Her face was filled with rage and she looked about to clock him in the nose. \"I can't belie-\" \"Carly!\" Nick shouted to get her to stop. \"I didn't mean it.\" He said as calmly as he could. Carly's eyes held fire in them but the sound of Wade chuckling made her stop and looked back down at her boyfriend. \"He's right.\" He nodded; Carly stopped stroking his hair back and looked at him confused. \"I see what you are trying to do Nick…\" He said, making eye contact with him. \"Let's pretend it worked.\" He said as he closed his eyes and swallowed hard. Carly looked up to Nick who smirked, Carly sighed and rolled her eyes before helping Wade sit up; Nick stood and put his hand on Wade's back to offer some support and once they were walking again he led the way down the hall, looking for the infirmary. Wade tripped a couple of times but Carly held him up and waited until he was ready to continue before she moved on. By the time they had found the infirmary Wade was near passing out. \"I need to stop…\" He breathed. Carly guided him over to the examination table and he laid down on the hard table, his breathing became deep and labored, he was struggling. Carly and Nick both broke off; Carly walked to the door and closed it before going back to Wade's side, Nick walked over to the window and stood in front of it, looking out to make sure that they were clear before he closed the blinds and turned back around. Carly was standing over Wade, leaning on the table he was lying on; her left elbow was resting by his neck, her arm wrapped around his head and pulling at his hair gently while her right hand cupped the side of his face. Nick stopped watching them and pounced on the cabinets, ripping them and any drawers open desperately trying to find anything to help before his injuries won over his own will to live. X.x.X.x Carly listened as Nick tore the infirmary apart behind her as she comforted her love, \"You're gonna be okay Wade… I promise.\" Wade looked up at her, his eyes glassed over and unfocused. \"Don't lie, Carly… it's not becoming.\" He smiled at her the best he could, trying his hardest to be strong for her. She forced out a small laugh, \"I'm not lying.\" She moved her hand away from his face and down to his left arm that was laying on his chest and rubbed her hand up and down his forearm. \"You just lied again…\" He swallowed hard, she winced at seeing the pain it caused his to just do something as simple as that. \"You're a terrible liar.\" He mumbled. Carly panicked when he closed his eyes and slapped his cheek a couple times, \"Stay with me Wade… don't you go to sleep!\" His eyes flew open. Nick stopped and looked over his shoulder to see what was happening before returning to his raiding. \"Carly…\" Wade stopped when he saw her. She looked awful, her torn bloody lips were truly the only color in her face, her lips and chin were quivering, and he could swear she had tears in her eyes. \"Hey…\" he said quietly and raised his hand to her face, ignoring the pain that shot through his shoulder to reach her. \"It's going to be okay.\" He comforted, she removed her arm from around his head to hold his hand to her cheek with her own. \"Now who's lying? You or me…\" She retorted, leaning her face into his touch. There was his girl. He grinned, a sincere grin. \"I love you.\" He said as he rubbed his thumb up and down her cheek. She pulled his hand away and kissed his palm. \"I love you too.\" She whispered. The corners of his mouth lifted a moment before he furrowed his brows and blinked a couple times and frowned, his eyes focusing somewhere on the ceiling. \"Wade what is it?\" She asked concerned; she laid his hand back down on the table and cupped the sides of his face and made him look at her. \"Wade… SHIT!\" She studied his face and shook her head in denial. \"Nick! He's scaring the shit outta me!\" She cried. X.x.X.x Nick looked over his shoulder to look at her again and felt his heart sink at the face she sent him. She had tears pouring down her cheeks and she looked terrified and heartbroken at the same time… he hated to see her like this. \"Fuck…\" He turned back around and ripped the last drawer open and found nothing. \"GOD DAMNIT!\" He shouted and kicked the counter. Carly jumped and spun to face him. \"What?\" He put both of his fists on the counter top, \"There's nothing here.\" He said in a low gruff voice. \"What?\" She asked, she almost sounded whiney, as if somebody just told her that her dog was just hit by a semi. \"I said there's nothing FUCKING here!\" He shouted as he turned to face her. All at once Nick felt like a total dick. He watched as his sister lost all hope and broke down. X.x.X.x Carly felt her heart sink to the very bottom of her stomach, she felt it shatter there and then felt as the shards cut her insides from the inside out. She closed her eyes and let out a sob… the love of her life was going to die here. She covered her mouth with her hand and let out short quick breaths, trying desperately to control her feelings. \"Oh shit… Carly…\" He took a couple steps forward, \"Carly I'm sorry.\" She wrapped her other arm around her stomach and turned away from him to look at Wade's body; he was still shaking profusely, he looked as if he was going to go into a seizure. \"I can't lose him.\" She choked out. Nick grabbed her hand and pulled her into a gentle hug. \"We won't… we're going to get him help. He's gonna make it.\" He assured her and pulled her away, holding her by her shoulders. \"Bo said…\" \"Who the fuck is Bo?\" She asked, her eyes flashing from sadness to anger. \"The guy who tied you up.\" He explained quickly, his voice holding a tone of 'it's not important' as if he was to wave the question off. \"He said he had medical supplies up at the house…\" \"He's full of shit Nick!\" \"There's gotta be SOMETHING up there Car… we have to at least try!\" He argued. Carly rose her eye brow, pursed her lips and rolled her eyes all at once. Nick relaxed his face and smirked, \"Trust me.\" Carly huffed but nodded, \"Alright the house is-\" Suddenly the door handle started to shake and when the door did not open there was a loud bang on the door. Carly nearly jumped out of her skin and spun around behind Nick, one hand gripping his shoulder the other his right arm as she peeked around him to watch the door. Nick put a hand behind him to tell her to stay put as he took a few steps forward. As he was reaching for the handle a large knife was thrust through the door; he dodge backwards just as the knife would have hit his neck. Carly screamed and put her hands up to her mouth as she jumped backwards. \"HOLY FUCK!\" Nick shouted as he jumped backwards as well, he spun around and ran for the window, nearly tearing the blinds off the window and throwing the window open. \"C'mon!\" Carly watched as the knife was thrust through the door repeatedly, she felt herself jump and step back with each thrust, it wasn't until Wade moved his head to watch what was happening that she moved to help him. \"Wade!\" She called his name as she moved to his side again. He watched the door for another moment before he looked back at her. \"Go\" he told her simply, his clammy grey skin scaring the living shit out of her and telling her he can't possibly keep going but she wouldn't leave him; not for anything. \"No! I'm not leaving you!\" She screamed and pulled at the black button up shirt, \"Get up Wade!\" \"Carly! C'mon!\" Nick yelled. \"NOT WITHOUT WADE!\" She screamed, her voice carrying a all new sense of terror. She pulled at him to get him up, barely raising him from the table, \"GET UP! She screamed, her eyes fixated on the torn up door. \"I can't…\" He muttered pathetically, his head lolling back and laying on the table, his eyes closed. \"CARLY! GOD DAMNIT!\" Nick shouted and ran to her side, pulling her away and ripping Wade half away from the table. \"WADE YOU GOD DAMN PUSSY GET OFF THIS FUCKING TABLE AND MOVE YOUR SORRY ASS BEFORE YOU GET US ALL KILLED!\" He screamed at the young man, his face inches from the others. Carly watched, half wanting to smack Nick for treating Wade like that while half hoping it works, he could hardly even hold his head up let alone run… Her gaze focused on the door as an arm punched through she screamed and grabbed Wade as well, \"WADE!\" She screamed next to his ear. Wade's face snapped to face hers, his eyes wide. A head appeared in the doorway and his hand reached for the door handle. \"SHIT!\" All three of them screamed, Wade's was quieter but it was something. The two siblings practically ripped him off the table and to the window, both his arms were wrapped around their shoulders as the rushed over to it. Carly crawled out the window, once she was out she looked behind the two of them to see the long haired man pulling at the handle. \"OH MY GOD HURRY!\" She screamed. Nick looked over to the door briefly before shoving Wade out the window, just as he was about to do the same Carly noticed that the man was in the room, knife at the ready. \"NICK BEHIND YOU!\" She screamed and pointed. Nick whipped around and dodged the knife just as it was about to be thrust through his chest. Carly and Wade both screamed and watched helplessly from outside the window. Suddenly all the lights in the town went dark, and all Carly could go off of was noise from inside the room. \"Shit…\" Wade muttered. The sound of grunts, curses, and crashes and sounds of flesh hitting flesh made Carly antsy as all hell. Then just as suddenly as it began it stopped. There was complete silence. \"Nick…?\" She whispered, gripping onto Wade's arm like it was a lifeline, \"Are you alright?\" She asked a little longer. A figure popped up in front of the window and she and Wade stepped back, \"Nick? That you man?\" Wade asked; his arms around Carly protectively, his heart was beating a mile a minute and he could feel the same of her heart. The figure threw his hands out and rested them on the window sill and then Nick's face appeared in the window. \"Yeah it's me.\" He smirked, blood dripped from his forehead and down the bridge of his nose to the tip. He jumped out and landed right in front of Wade and Carly. \"Oh Nick…\" She said gently and stepped away from Wade to examine her brother, \"Are you okay?\" \"Never felt better. I beat that piece of shit to a pulp.\" He nodded his head in the direction of a line of stores, \"Let's go.\" She nodded and moved towards Wade, giving him a gentle hug. \"Are YOU okay?\" \"I still got some fight in me yet.\" He said gruffly, though through gritted teeth as he started to walk forward. Carly moved to his side and wrapped his arm around her shoulders, \"I've got you.\" Wade looked down at her and smiled, \"I know.\" The three of them made their way to a hunting store slowly, but as Nick picked up a rock Carly stopped him, \"Nick they'll hear that!\" She whispered harshly. \"Well it's either make some noise and have something to defend ourselves with… or go around like a bunch of pussy's with NO weapon.\" Nick shot back, throwing the rock up and down in his hand. Carly made 'the face' once again, consisting of the usual raised eyebrow, pursed lips and the rolling of her eyes. Nick smirked and chucked the rock at the window, shattering it. He jumped up into the display case and scoffed at the wax mannequin. He'd never be able to see wax again without losing his mind. He jumped back down and weighed the crossbow in his hands, getting a feel for it. \"That's more like it.\" \"Now can we get out of here before they find us in the middle of the road?\" Carly asked impatiently. Nick sent Wade a look and he smiled. \"Alright you got a plan?\" Nick asked his sister as they began to walk down the street. \"Well like you said there might be some stuff at the house for Wade… and there's a truck… or there should be…\" She said, shifting a little under Wade's weight. Wade adjusted his arm placement and shifted a little more of his weight off of his ever caring girlfriend. Nick nodded, \"Simple enough.\" \"Since when are you one for simple?\" Carly shot. Nick sent her a look but didn't say anything; they turned left at a major intersection but froze when they saw a figure walking across the street a block down. \"Shit.\" Nick said under his breath and guided the other two into a theater on their left. The three of them ran inside as fast as they could and then turned into a movie room to hide, Carly gasped when she heard the door bust in; Bo had found them. The three of them scattered amongst the figures watching the black and white movie, most likely the same one for the past 20 to 30 years. Nick ran to the back of the theater and hid behind a curtain while Carly ushered Wade to the middle row and the middle seat and she bolted to the very front of the theater and sat on the far left; away from the aisle. Bo came busting through the back doors and scanned the area. Carly tried desperately not to breathe… to hold her breath and just wait for him to pass. The last thing she wanted was to give anyone away. A shotgun blast resounded in the small theater and she jumped up and screamed, believing he had shot and killed one of the two boys she loved the most. Bo looked up at her and she stared right back. She was just caught, he had blown off some previous souls head but it was not Wade OR Nick. At this point, time, seemed to move in slow motion. Her whole body seemed to tense up and then sag as she accepted she had just fucked up. Bo raised the shotgun and pointed it at her, Carly closed her eyes and waited for something to happen; whether it be her end or somebody saving her sorry ass she wasn't sure… but she would wait. She heard the gun cock but just as she figured the trigger should be pulled she heard a glorious sound, \"NO!\" Carly's eyes flew open and she looked to Wade who had stood up screaming for Bo to stop. Bo turned and faced what would have been his first victim for the day and smiled so evilly Carly swore he had to be the son of the devil. Bo trained his gun on Wade and got ready to pull the trigger. \"NO!\" Carly screamed as loud as she could and started to run at the crazy man. Bo turned back to her and the sound of a gunshot froze her in her steps. She stared forward, staring at Bo as he stared at her in the same way. She could vaguely hear the sounds of both Wade and Nick screaming her name. She looked to her right a little to see Wade running through the seats to get to her. She smiled, maybe he would be okay… she felt numb as she fell to the floor her entire world went black. X.x.X.x Bum bum bum buuuum! Betcha didn't see THAT one coming didja? Guess what THIS is called? A 'cliffhanger'… what happens next? …. tune in… next Wednesday and find out. Please review…![Chapter 4] Okay, uhm, I basically gave up on this story in March heh. But due to the sudden popularity I figured I would give you guys a break. However I may be a little out of practice in writing a horror story like this… so be patient. I hope it's to your liking and not too far off of the previous chapters. Glad you all enjoyed it so much, and I appreciate your reviews SO much: Doyleshuny MusicIsLove0717 MissAmazing101 And BetahimeTsukiko You guys rock. Enjoy! X.x.X.x Wade ran past Bo, not minding the least bit that the man was still standing and collapsed by Carly and pulled her limp body into his lap. \"Carly?\" He called her name and stroked her red hair away from her face. The sound of the crossbow going off caused him to jump and look behind him, just in time to see Bo crumple to the floor. Looking up Wade saw Nick standing 'bad ass' like at the top of the stairs and smiled weakly. \"Nice shot.\" Nick nodded and quickly walked up to the body of Bo as Wade turned back to Carly, \"Carly… honey… wake up…\" Wade didn't see any blood, did he miss? Wade brushed her hair back and went over her head carefully for any bumps and then down to her abdomen and other areas for gunshot wounds, nothing. The worried young man heard rustling behind him so he looked over his shoulder again; Nick had grabbed Bo's shotgun and slung it over his shoulder and had thrown Bo off to the side, farther away from them but in sight. Once Nick was done with his clean up duty he looked to Wade, \"She okay?\" Shrugging as he shook his head, Wade didn't know what to say. \"I don't see anything wrong with her…\" \"Wade?\" Carly called groggily. Wade's head snapped back to Carly, \"Oh Carly! Are you alright?\" He asked, stroking her hair back nervously and his eyes studying her face for any sign of discomfort. She nodded. \"Yeah, yeah I'm good.\" She smiled weakly, \"I guess he missed.\" The comment earned smirks from both men. \"Thank god.\" Wade said tiredly, the adrenaline he had felt when he watched her drop was fading and the blood loss was getting to him. As soon as Carly saw Wade start to look tired and dizzy again she sat up and knelt in front of him. \"Wade, Wade c'mon stay with me now.\" She ordered gently, cupping his face in her hands. Looking up to Nick she shook her head and he nodded. \"Alright tough guy.\" Nick said gruffly Before anything else was said Nick pulled Wade up to his feet, earning an annoyed groan from the wounded man. \"We gotta keep you on your feet.\" \"Yeah, so when I pass out I have a farther drop.\" Wade said dryly and Nick smiled. The three young adults stumbled out the doors of the theater and back into the streets. \"This way\" Carly breathed and pointed down the road. Nick took Carly's job of holding up the weakest of the three and Carly had the shotgun held out in front of her, in reality taking Nick's 'old job'. \"You sure?\" Nick asked after they had been walking for awhile. She nodded. \"Yeah, I'm positive.\" She said in a low voice, one neither Nick nor Wade could place. \"Okay…\" Nick said quietly and looked down at Wade who was looking pretty pathetic. He looked like a 12 year old without his goatee, and with no eyebrows he just looked like a cancer patient with a thick wig on. \"Oh man…\" He muttered. \"What?\" Wade looked up at his friend, his eyebrow would have been quirked up if he had one. \"Mm, nothing.\" Nick shook his head and looked forward again and watched his sister stumble a bit. \"Car, are you sure you're alright.\" Throwing her hands out to the side, one still holding the shotgun she let out an exasperated sigh. \"I said I'm fine!\" She said defensively. \"Bull shit!\" Nick shouted from behind her, causing her to stop in her tracks. \"You're gonna ' bull shit ' me?\" She argued her eyebrows nearly off her face, flames in her eyes. If the three of them were in a cartoon Carly would have been a towering beast, with flames spewing from her eyes and smoke out her ears, while the two of them would have been specks, no bigger than one of her finger nails with huge beads of sweat on the side of their faces and huge puppy eyes. However, this wasn't a cartoon, it was more like something out of a horror movie and it was real. Carly curled up her fists and started to walk up to them when an engine came on from somewhere behind her. She looked over her shoulder, her hair flipping over her other shoulder in the process. \"They're coming!\" She cried and ran back to Wade as if to protect him. \"What do you think we should do?\" Nick asked in a quiet voice. The read head shook her head and held the gun with her left hand and wrapped her arm around Wade's left arm with her right, being careful not to pull down on it as to jostle his stab wound. \"I dunno. Maybe they're just…\" Suddenly a car tore down the road and the three teens jumped out of the way and hid in a ditch. \"Uhm guys…\" Wade grunted. \"Sssh\" Nick waved his hand in Wades face to quiet him. \"Guys…\" Wade bit out. \"What is it hon…\" Carly asked absent mindedly, really just looking over the muddy hill to see the truck drive away. \"You're on my ankle.\" Jumping a little Carly nearly leapt away from Wade and Nick did the same. \"Sorry… I'm sorry\" Carly whispered and cupped his face in her hands as she pressed her face into his neck. She pulled away and looked down at his leg; the sock she had pulled over his foot was soaked in blood, \"Fuck…\" She muttered. \"We have to get to the house. Now\" Nick nodded from the other side of Wade before peeking over the hill of the ditch for any movement. \"We're clear.\" He announced and jumped out of the ditch and onto the paved road. \"Grab my hand Wade.\" He ordered and held his hands out for the injured man. It took Wade a little too long to even acknowledge that Nick had spoken to him and when he did it was only a mere nod. \"He's losing a lot of blood Nick.\" Carly said quietly, having lifted Wade's pant leg to get a look at the wound. Wade's wound was pulsing blood, giving a nice even flow but that meant he was losing a lot fast. \"Wade, c'mon man pull it together for a little longer.\" Nick encouraged. Wade blinked slowly but with a little push from Carly and he lifted his right hand for Nick to grab and pull him out of the muddy pit they had been sitting in. Once Nick had pulled Wade out Carly scrambled up after them. \"This way\" She pointed up the road before brushing her hands off on her legs. \"It's up this hill and then to the left.\" She informed as she led the way up the small incline. X.x.X.x It wasn't until they had reached the driveway to 'the house' that Nick noticed they were missing something. \"Carly. Where's the gun…?\" He asked from behind her. Carly was, again, leading the way while Nick helped Wade keep up. \"It's… it's…\" Carly spun around. \"Fuck, I must have left it in the ditch!\" Her eyes were wide and terrified. \"I'll go back and get it.\" Shaking his head Nick discouraged the thought. \"No, no we gotta keep moving forward. Wade can't keep this up much longer.\" It was true, Wade was practically hanging off of Nick and he could barely even hold his own head up. She nodded, \"Okay\" She looked back up the driveway, \"We're almost there.\" She looked back at the two men one last time receiving a curt nod from Nick she turned around and walked up the driveway. As the house came into view she walked slowly and instinctively crouched down lower, constantly on the watch for sudden movement. On the corner of her eye she saw something flash and she looked over to her right and smiled. There was stacked wood, but with it was an axe. Quickly walking over to the wood she pulled the axe out of a stump, where Bo and his brother must chop the wood. Once it was out of the stump she held it in her hands and weighed it, good enough for me. When she turned back around she smirked at Nick who was smiling his approval of her choice. \"Axe me a question… I dare you.\" She whispered. He smiled and she walked back over to him and Wade. \"Okay, I'll lead, you keep watch out front till I give you the okay.\" Nick nodded and she kissed his cheek, when she pulled back he looked shocked. \"It's what brothers and sisters do okay. Get over it.\" She smirked and he did so in return, relaxing. \"Wade, Wade… \" She whispered his name and tilted his chin up so he'd look at her. \"We're almost out of here… okay? Just hold on a little longer and we'll get you fixed up, get in the truck and get out of here. \" She kissed him gently on the lips and studied him carefully he didn't seem to be with it anymore. \"Car… we…\" Nick sighed. \"There's no truck, they drove off with it.\" Carly made a face, \"Doesn't Dalton have his car? How did you get here?\" He nodded, \"True but… you really think making Wade walk all the way back to the gas station is wise?\" \"Maybe by the time we're done here they will have come back and we can grab the truck then.\" \"Carly…\" She threw up her hand, \"Just. One thing at a time okay?\" She whispered harshly. Nodding Nick stopped trying, \"Okay.\" \"Thank you.\" She said with a sigh. \"Cover me.\" With that said she raised the axe and slowly turned the handle to the front door and pushed it open, her heart was pounding loud enough she could hear it in her ears, she just hoped nobody else could hear it. She looked over her shoulder one last time and Nick give her a reassuring smile, still holding up her boyfriend. She quirked an eyebrow and smirked as if to say, 'here we go' and with that she closed the door behind her, she was in the house of evil. X.x.X.x Okay, not a very long chapter I know. But I really just wanted to get this out for you guys. Sorry… I'll be keeping up with this better I promise….

Una imaginación inigualable que conlleva un amor de locura en el que no avanzas ni te atreves asumir el riesgo, donde tu mayor miedo es el rechazo por la paradoja del amor libre. Hace unos años conocí los ojos más lindo que había visto en mi corta vida, pero debo admitir que desde ese día nada volvió hacer igual, ya años atrás cuando era solo una niña me habían surgido dudas que nunca me habían preocupado porque eran tan irrelevantes como ver un ave en tu ventana a las 5 de la mañana, algo curioso pero que no conflictuaba tu vida, todo había transitado así durante los primeros años de mi adolescencia hasta aquel día un 16 de agosto, lo recuerdo bien era el primer día de la preparatoria, estaba nerviosa, no había sido la mejor estudiante durante la secundaria ni había sido la chica más social pero hay estaba frente a un grupo de alumnos mirando las rejas verdes de lo que sería mi nueva escuela. Camine por el patio de aquellas instalaciones sin saber que hay pasaría los mejores momentos de mi vida, me dirigía al edición \"A\" en el salón 301 donde seria mi primer clase, mientras camino pienso ¿en qué sitio me sentare?, ¿Hare amigos?, ¿me gustara las clases?, etc… Pasan tantas preguntas por mi cabeza que sin percatarme he llegado a mi salón con dudas entro en el aula. Miro un grupo de jóvenes al fondo parecen platicar, tres chicas en el centro del salón y un par de chicas al frente de la clase, busco el lugar que este solo y es en ese momento cuando mi subconsciente la conoce, está sola en el fondo en una banca junto a la pared, ella tiene su móvil en manos. Camino entre la fila de bancas y me siento en la que está a un costado, la miro, pero ella parece inmersa en su celular, no hago más, saco las cosas que llevo en la mochila y las pongo sobre el buro, después observo el salón es grande, limpio y cómodo. El reloj marca 6:50 am estoy ansiosa por comenzar sin embargo aún no llega el profesor, observó y cada que entra alguien lo analizo parecen igual de confundidos que yo, hasta que entra una chica que se sienta a un costado mío y comienza a platicar conmigo, para ser sincera no me agrada la gente que habla mucho, así que muy pronto la aburro y comienza a platicar con ella, parece que han congeniado, sin querer después de unos minutos ahora somos 8 personas hablando, bueno ellos hablan mientras yo espero que acabe el día, al fin entra el profesor y todos ponemos atención a la primer clase.[Chapter 2] Han pasado 4 horas de clases y ha llegado el tiempo del receso, Laura la joven que se ha sentado a lado mío me dice que salgamos a despejarnos, le dijo que si, mientras finjo meter mis cosas en la bolsa realmente quiero que se desesperen y se vayan sin mí, sin embargo, después de mi intento fallido salgo y me voy con ellas. Durante el tiempo libre nos hemos presentado ahora se que los jóvenes que estaban frente a mí se llaman Joaquín y Daniela, las chicas que estaban a un costado eran Renata y Susana, y atrás de ellas estaba Fernanda y la chica con el móvil era Elizabeth.Regresamos a clase a concluir con el día y cuando pienso que al fin me he librado de ellos preguntan la ruta que toman para ir a casa, ahora estoy en el transporte acompañada de Renata, Susana y Elizabeth. Así pasan los primeros días, ellas hablan mientras yo intento no ponerles atención, sin embargo, noto que se han ido separado y que cada día se han ido forjando amistades independientes supongo que la razón es la misma que la mía, se han percatado que congenian más con una persona que con las otras, lo irónico es que parece que yo no me llevo bien con ninguno, algunos días me toca sentarme con Susana otros con Renata y otros con Laura, que complicado es hacer nuevos amigos. Pero como siempre la vida tiene sorpresa y aquel martes cambio mi día y mi vida, cuando al entrar al aula observe que el único lugar vacío era a lado de ella, de Elizabeth, no sé qué pasa pero mientras camino siento nervios, estoy segura que en esa fecha no era consciente de que me pasaba pero mi subconsciente lo sabía, mientras me acerco recuerdo pensar que ella era la más especial del grupo, la que hacia caras cuando algo le desagradaba, nunca me había sentado con ella y realmente hablábamos muy poco, recuerdo haber concluido mi pensamiento con \"seguro me caerá mal\". Nos miramos y parece que a ninguna de las dos nos gusta la idea de estar juntas, pero ya estoy frente a ella, así que le dijo \"me das permiso\", siempre se sentaba en la esquina junto a la pared era necesario pedir permiso, se mueve un poco y paso con mi bolsa. Saludo a Laura y Susana están sentadas frente a nosotras, les pregunto algo sobre la tarea de ese día y unos minutos después llega el profesor. Mientras el profesor se esfuerza por que nos quede claro el tema de lineales, comienzo a realizar dibujos en mi libro realmente está muy aburrida la clase, sin percatarme ella observa lo que dibujo y cuando me doy cuenta toma un lápiz y comienza hacer trazos en mi libro mientras diceAsí se ve mejor,observo los dibujos que ha plasmado en mi libro y comienzo a reír, la miro y nos burlamos del profesor, sin dudarlo paso página hasta encontrar algo creativo y plasmar nuestra arte de Picasso. Recuerdo que ese día reímos mucho hasta que el profesor nos llamó la atención, su sonrisa era realmente escandalosa y muchos volteaban a vernos. Ese día en el transporte nos sentamos juntas y comenzamos a reír de todo lo que veíamos en el camino. Sin querer ella rompió con mi personalidad fría y aislante, había encontrado alguien que entendía mi humor y congeniábamos, era mi amiga y así la veía.

Kai dan Sehun Cameo : cari sendiri. buanyak soalnya. setelah membaca silahkan untuk memberikan review kalian. love dan masukan cerita ini ke library kalian ! HAPPY READING GUYS !! Syuuuutttt Suara angin bertiupan di malam hari. Suasana yang gelap dan juga udara yang dingin. Seorang namja bak tiang sedang berjalan mengendap endap ke sebuah area seperti gudang yang ada di sebuah kota kecil di Thailand. \"Astaga.. dimana orang itu?\" Ia menghangatkan tubuhnya dengan tangannya. Ia menggesek telapak tangannya untuk di tempelkan diwajahnya yang tampan bak pangeran. Kreek.. \"meeeooonggg\" Suara dahan pohon yang terinjak. Ia benar benar merinding saat ini. Walau hanya ada suara kucing tapi ia benar benar merasa takut sekarang. oOo \"Terima kasih atas kerja kerasnya !\" Seorang namja mungil. Tidak terlalu mungil sebenarnya. Ia cukup tinggi di kalangan wanita biasa .. ingat wanita biasa bukan modeling ataupun artis. Ia habis bekerja paruh waktu di sebuah minimarket dekat dengan rumah kecilnya. Kota ini hanya kota kecil tak banyak orang yang tinggal disini. Tapi jika dilihat kota ini cukup indah. \"Husshh.. husshh..\" Namja mungil itu terdiam. Ingin mempertajam pendengarannya. Ia menoleh kearah kanan kiri depan belakang jalan. Tapi tak ada orang. Kecuali.. seseorang yang sedang bermain dengan seekor kucing liar. \"Yak yak .. go .. go.. !\" Ia mendekati namja itu. Tapi ia seperti tak asing saat melihatnya. Dan benar saja namja itu.. \"Are you Chanyeol SKY ?\" Namja tiang itu terkejut dengan kehadiran orang itu. Bagaimana tidak saat suasana senyap ada seseorang yang berbicara padamu. Tapi ada yang menarik pada pertanyaan itu. \"You know me?\" Ia mundur beberapa langkah. Takut jika orang itu adalah sasaengny. \"Ya.. i know you\" \"Are u.. sasaeng fan?\" \"What? Iam? Noo.. i dont like u and your group !\" \"Really?\" \"Yaa. Dont be afraid. Im good people. \" Ia mendekati namja tiang itu yang masih ketakutan. \"Dan aku bisa bahasa Korea\" \"Mwo?!\" \"Kalau begitu dari tadi kita bicara bahasa korea saja.. dasar merepotkan !\" Lanjutnya \"Hahaha\" Namja mungil itu semakin mungil di dekat namja tiang itu. Apalagi saat cuaca gelap begini. \"Namaku Pan !\" \"Kau tau namaku kan?\" \"Eum.. tapi kau bisa memanggilku Baekhyun. Pan Itu namaku di Thailand\" \"Ahh.. iya.. Baekhyun..\" Hening' \"Kenapa kau disini? Kau ada kerjaan?\" \"Aku ada syuting disini. Tapi saat syuting sudah selesai. Ada seseorang yang menghubungiku. \" \"Lalu?\" \"Dia menyuruhku untuk datang kesini. Katanya dia ingin memberikanku sebuah kontrak kerja bisnis disini.\" \"Kau percaya?\" \"Tentu saja.. dia bahkan memberikanku uang yang banyak. Katanya itu untuk honor pertama karna aku menyetujui kontraknya\" \"Kontrak mu sudah disetujui?\" \"Setujui lewat via ponsel. Dan sekarang aku menunggunya untuk menandatangani berkas kontraknya.\" Mereka lama berbincang sampai tak terasa malam semakin gelap. \"Aku harus pulang Chanyeol ssi.. \" \"Ahh iya.. terima kasih karna telah menemaniku.\" Wajah Baekhyun terlihat khawatir dengan keadaan Chanyeol. Bagaimana tidak. Ia seperti diberikan harapan palsu oleh orang asing itu. \"Kau.. yakin akan menunggunya?\" \"Ehm.. \" \"Ba..baiklah.. tapi.. jika kau masih lama kau bisa menunggu dirumahku\" \"Ahh.. tidak tidak ! Aku tidak mau merepotkanmu!\" Baekhyun mengangguk dan ia pergi meninggalkan Chanyeol. Walau berat. Bagaimana tidak berat.. ia benar benar khawatir. Bagaimana kalau Chanyeol di jebak ? Atau ia akan diculik? Apalagi Chanyeol adalah salah satu member dari Boygroup terkenal di Korea yakni SKY. Jika penggemarnya tahu.. apalagi jika Sasaeng mereka tahu. Bisa bisa Chanyeol di manfaatkan oleh mereka. Tidak tidak ! Lupakan fikiran negatifmu Baekhyun. oOo Chanyeol masih menunggu orang asing itu sampai ia tidak tahu bahwa seluruh membernya telah pergi meninggalkannya. 'Sebelum Kejadian' \"Cut !\" \"Kerja bagus SKY\" mereka saling mengucapkan terima kasih karna syuting mereka telah selesai. \"Chanyeol. Hari ini kau sangat tampan!\" \"Hei.. Sehun.. kau tahu kau lebih tampan!\" Mereka saling tertawa kecuali Kai. Ia terlihat gelisah dengan telponnya. \"Kai.. kau tak apa?\" \"Eoh?\" \"Kau terlihat gelisah.. kau tak sakit kan?\" Kai memegang tangan namja mungil di depannya. \"Luhan.. bisa kau bantu aku?\" \"Apa? Katakan saja Kai\" \"Ehm.. i..ini.. bisa kau transfer uang ke rekening ini?\" \"Ini kan rekening..\" \"Kumohon.. tapi jangan beritahu dia . Kalau aku yang mengirim uang itu.\" Luhan menghembuskan nafasnya. \"Baiklah.. akan ku lakukan\" Luhan meninggalkan Kai lalu mendekati kedua teman grup nya yang sedang tertawa bersama. \"Ahh Kai.. kau dari mana saja?\" \"Aku? Ahh.. aku dari toilet.\" Sehun menatap Kai curiga. Mana mungkin tidak. Ia terlihat mandi keringat seperti ketakutan. \"Kau sakit Kai?\" \"Tidak Hun..\" Sehun mengangguk percaya. \"Aku mau ke toilet dulu Chan Kai.. \" \"Ehm..\" Sehun meninggalkan kedua member itu. Kai dan Chanyeol terlihat berbincang bersama seperti teman pada biasanya. Tapi tak berselang lama ponsel Chanyeol berbunyi. Ia mengerutkan dahinya saat melihat pesan di ponselnya. \"Ada apa Chan?\" Tanya Kai saat melihat raut bingung temannya itu. \"Ahh tak apa Kai. Tapi sepertinya aku harus pergi sebentar\" \"Kemana? Sebentar lagi kita harus kembali ke Korea\" \"Hanya sebentar.. nanti aku menyusul kalian.. tunggulah\" Chanyeol berlari meninggalkan Kai yang bingung menatapnya. Merasa seperti Chanyeol sedang menutupi sebuah rahasia. Sehun melihat Kai yang sendirian dengan ponselnya. \"Dimana Chanyeol ? \" \"Chanyeol? Dia sedang pergi. Tapi aku tak tahu dia kemana. Bukankah itu aneh?\" \"Sudahlah.. mungkin dia bertemu dengan seorang temannya di Thailand\" Kai terlihat curiga pada Sehun. Bagaimana bisa Sehun biasa saja saat ini. \"Di Thailand? Apa kau tahu siapa teman Chanyeol di Thailand?\" \"Aku tidak tahu Kai.. tapi mungkin Chanyeol punya teman rahasia.\" \"Hah.. baiklah\" Luhan berlari kearah staf untuk cepat kembali ke bandara. \"Kai Sehun.. jadwal penerbangannya 2 jam lagi ayo masuk ke mobil van.\" Sehun dan Kai menurut. Mereka memasuki mobil van mereka dengan raut wajah yang sulit ditebak. Dilain tempat Chanyeol terlihat senang saat melihat ponselnya. Ia menatap pesan dari seseorang yang tidak ia kenal. 'Aku adalah sutradara ternama di Thailand. Aku melihatmu di lokasi syuting tadi. Dan kurasa kau sangat cocok untuk film ku.. Temui aku jika kau ingin bermain film di Thailand. Itu akan membuat mu semakin terkenal di ASIA' 'Aku sudah mentransfer sedikit uang untuk honor pertama mu.. \" \"Padahal ia mengirim banyak uang padaku. Ia pasti sangat kaya karna bilang kalau itu uang yang sedikit\" 'Aku akan menunggumu di lorong *\" \"Ahh.. ini awal yang bagus untuk karirku.. aku harus cepat\" Flasback off Chanyeol tidak berfikir untuk menanyai nama dan alamat dari sutradara itu. Ia terlalu senang saat itu sampai tidak bisa berfikir jernih sekarang. Baekhyun tidak pulang. Ia menunggu di sebuah tempat yang tersembunyi. Menatap Chanyeol dengan raut wajah kasihan. Bagaimana bisa Chanyeol percaya dengan ucapan orang asing. \"Ahh.. sepertinya ia tidak datang.\" Baekhyun jengah melihat semua ini. Ia keluar dari persembunyian. Menghampiri Chanyeol. \"Kenapa kau tak menghubunginya?\" \"Eoh? Ahh itu karna ponselnya tidak bisa dihubungi\" Baekhyun benar benar frustasi. Bagaimana bisa seorang idol setolol ini? Apa ia tidak berfikir kalau dia sedang di permainkan? \"Apa kau berfikir kalau ini jebakan?\" \"Apa?\" \"Kau sudah menunggunya. Tapi dia tidak datang. Dan kau menghubunginya tapi ponselnya tidak aktif.. apa kau merasa itu aneh?\" \"Tentu.. tidak!\" 'Aishhh' itu adalah jeritan Baekhyun sampai ia menjambak rambutnya karna merasa benar benar seperti orang gila saat berbicara dengan seorang idol. \"Huhh.. Lebih baik kau pulang\" \"Kau benar.. lebih baik aku pu.. hah?!\" \"Ada apa?!\" Chanyeol terlihat panik saat mencari ponselnya. Bagaimana tidak ia sedang memegang ponselnya tadi. Tapi sekarang tidak ada. \"Po..ponselku tidak ada\" Ia merogoh saku yang ada di kemeja dan celananya. Ia benar benar panik. \"Kau gila?! Dimana kau meletakkannya?!\" 'Meoongg' \"Huh?\" \"Kucing itu !\" \"Ponselku !!\" Mereka melihat seekor kucing yang tadi bermain dengan Chanyeol sedang menggigit ponselnya. Ia benar benar shock. Bagaimana bisa kucing itu menggigit ponselnya? \"KEJAR KUCING ITU !!\" Baekhyun dan Chanyeol berlarian mengejar kucing itu. Yaa namanya Kucing. Ia pasti akan lebih cepat dari pada kedua manusia yang masih tertinggal di belakang. Sruuuutt.. Kucing itu melempar asal ponsel Chanyeol sampai ponsel itu terbanting beberapa kali. \"Dasar puncuri !\" Baekhyun mengambil ponsel itu dan membersihkan ponsel itu dari debu . Ia memberikan ponsel itu kepada pemiliknya yang sedang mencari oksigen karna lama berlari. \"Te..hah..rima..hah.. kasih..\" Chanyeol mulai menghidupkan ponselnya. Bukannya senang saat mendapat ponselnya kembali.. tapi ia malah terlihat semakin cemas. \"Apa? Kenapa?!\" \"Po..ponselnya.. tidak hidup\" \"Apa?! Coba berikan\" Baekhyun mencoba menghidupkan ponsel Chanyeol tapi nihil. Hasilnya tetap sama yaitu mati. \"Ini pasti karna terbanting tadi\" \"Dasar kurang ajar.. jika aku menemui kucing pencuri itu lagi.. aku akan membunuhnya\" \"Sudahlah.. namanya juga kucing liar.. \" Baekhyun meninggalkan Chanyeol yang masih terlihat marah. Ia tidak sadar jika ia sudah sendirian sekarang. \"Bae..Baekhyun ! Tunggu aku !!\" oOo \"Ini rumahku. Kau bisa kembali ke hotel mu sekarang\" \"Bagaimana aku tahu hotelku dimana!\" \"Apa?! Apa maksudmu kau tidak tahu dimana kau menginap bodoh !\" \"Aku tidak tahu Baekhyun ! Aku ini idol aku tidak tahu apa apa tentang itu semua !! kau fikir aku ini staff?!\" Hah.. Baekhyun benar benar harus ekstra sabar menghadapi idol bodoh ini. Apakah semua idol seperti itu? Tidak tahu tempat mereka menginap? Apa mereka tidak tahu alamat ataupun nama hotel itu ?! Satu kata untuk Chanyeol dari Baekhyun 'ceroboh'. \"Nama hotelnya pun kau tak tahu?\" \"Tidak..\" \"Kau tahu nomor teman teman mu atau managermu?\" \"Tidak..\" \"Kau tahu nomor ibumu?\" \"Tidak..\" \"Lalu apa yang kau tahu bodoh!!\" \"Aku tidak tahu apa apa?! Yang aku tahu hanya aku itu manusia tampan\" 'Tampar aku sekarang' itu yang ingin dikatakan Baekhyun pada semua orang. Idol ini memang punya pribadi yang songong. \"Aku masuk dulu!\" Chanyeol panik saat melihat Baekhyun mulai memasuki rumahnya. Otomatis ia akan sendirian. Didalam kegelapan. \"Tu..tunggu.. \" \"Apalagi?\" \"Seharusnya kau menawariku kan?\" \"Menawari? Seperti apa?\" \"Seperti.. Chanyeol.. ini sudah gelap. Kau juga tidak tahu tempat mu menginap. Jadi tinggalah dirumahku semalaman.\" \"Ahh.. kau ingin aku bicara begitu?\" \"Yaa ! Seharusnya begitukan?\" \"Kau harus tahu kenapa aku tidak ingin mengatakan itu. Pertama ! Tempat ini bukanlah hotel ataupun motel !. Kedua ! Tempat ini tidak cocok untukmu. Ketiga ! AKU TIDAK SUDI TINGGAL BERSAMAMU !!!!\" Baekhyun membuka dan membanting pintu rumahnya. Chanyeol? Dia benar benar terkejut . oOo Hari makin gelap dan cuaca sepertinya sedang tidak bersahabat. Karna air hujan mulai turun. Chanyeol masih disana. Tepatnya di depan pintu rumah Baekhyun. Ia fikir hanya disinilah yang membuatnya merasa aman. Karna ia tidak tahu dimana tempat aman yang lain. Lebih tepatnya ia tidak tahu daerah ini. Chanyeol memegangi ponselnya. Ia sudah tidak perduli dengan ponsel yang terkena hujan itu. Toh ponsel itu juga sudah mati. Sudah sulit untuk hidup. Rasanya ia ingin menggali lubang untuk menguburi ponsel keluaran terbaru itu. Tubuhnya? Yaa tidak terlalu basah.. ia masih terlindungi oleh atap rumah Baekhyun. Klek.. \"Kau masih disini?\" Chanyeol menoleh dan melihat Baekhyun yang menggunakan piama tidur seperti wanita. Karna bermotif kelinci pink. Ia sedikit tersipu. \"Masuklah..\" Chanyeol memasuki rumah Baekhyun yang tidak besar.. rumahnya 2 tingkat. Ada ruang tamu tanpa sofa disana. Kamar mandi dan diujung ada dapur . Dan di lantai dua tempat kamar. \"Mandilah. Dan ganti pakaianmu. \" \"Aku tidak punya pakaian ganti\" \"Aku sudah meletakkan pakaian di kamar mandi. Kau bisa menggunakannya. \" Chanyeol mengangguk. Ia rasa kalau Baekhyun sudah menyiapkan ini saat ia sedang berada diluar rumahnya. Chanyeol baru saja ingin membuka pintu kamar mandi. Tapi perkataan Baekhyun membuatnya benar benar dapat menciptakan warna merah diwajahnya. \"A..aku memang punya pakaian yang besar. Tapi aku tidak punya celana dalam.. ekhem yang besar.. \" \"Ja..jadi maksudmu..\" \"Kau tidak usah pakai celana dalam.\" Chanyeol langsung masuk ke kamar mandi tanpa melihat Baekhyun yang juga sedang tersipu. Bagaimana tidak ? Ia mungkin bisa melihat jelas bentuk dari penis idol itu. Walau hanya dari balik celana. Saat Chanyeol memasuki kamar mandi ia benar benar bingung saat melihat poster member SNSD yang memakai bikini ditempel di kamar mandi ini. Tak habis fikir Baekhyun bahkan melaminasikan poster itu agar tidak basah. \"Bagaimana caraku mandi kalau aku ditatap oleh sunbaeku ?\" Poster itu memang terlihat sedang memandang Chanyeol. Ia jadi merasa kalau ia sedang mandi bersama seniornya. \"TIDAK !!!\" oOo Ceklek \"Eoh? Piyamanya cocok denganmu\" Chanyeol melihat tubuhnya. 'Dari mana cocoknya ? Pakaian ini malah membuatku sesak nafas' batinnya. \"Yaa.. lumayan\" Chanyeol tersenyum pada Baekhyun yang sedang memasak mi instan. Apa ? Mi instan? \"Aku tidak tahu seleramu. Jadi aku hanya masak mi instan\" \"Aku tidak boleh makan itu !\" Baekhyun mengerutkan dahinya. Kenapa tidak boleh. Apa mi ini beracun? Fikirnya. \"Kau ingatkan kalau aku idol?\" Ahh.. Baekhyun melupakan fakta itu. \"Maaf aku lupa. Jadi kau mau makan apa?\" \"Apapun kecuali mi instan\" Namja mungil itu membuka lemari esnya dan melihat berbagai makanan mentah. Bukan daging tapi sayuran. Ahh kecuali telur ayam. \"Aku punya ini !\" Seru Baekhyun sambil memegang sebuah telur ayam. \"Hanya satu?\" \"Eum.. tadinya ada dua. Tapi satunya sudah kumasukan dalam mi instan\" \"Baiklah.. aku mau itu. \" Baekhyun menghidupkan kompor satunya. Untuk memasak telur ayam. Sebenarnya itu adalah telur persiapan Baekhyun untuk besok. Tapi tak masalah.. ia bisa memberikan telur itu pada tamunya. oOo Makanan sudah jadi. Mi instan di depan Baekhyun dan telur rebus di hadapan Chanyeol. Baekhyun memakan makanannya dengan baik. Suara sluurrpp.. membuat Chanyeol menelan ludah. Ia sudah mulai tergoda. Ahh telur setengah matang itu juga sungguh menggiurkan. Siapa yang bisa menolak godaan mi instan? \"A.. apa itu enak?\" Chanyeol mulai bertanya tanpa melepas pandangan dari mi instan Baekhyun. \"Tentu saja ! Kau mau?\" \"A..aku..\" Chanyeol memajukan tangannya hendak mengambil mi instan itu tapi berhenti saat Baekhyun mengatakan \"Sayangnya kau seorang Idol. Jadi kau tidak bisa memakannya.\" \"APA?!\" \"makan saja telurmu itu\" \"Te..telurku?\" Chanyeol dan Baekhyun mulai diam. Seperti berfikir dalam keheningan. 'Telurku.. sepertinya ia berfikir mesum' 'Kenapa dia menatapku begitu ? Aku kan hanya bilang telurnya tapi kena..pa.. astaga! Aku bilang telurnya?!' \"Jangan berfikir macam macam !\" \"A..aku tidak \" \"Maksudku itu telur yang ada didepanmu bukan telur yang ada di bawahmu !\" \"Ck ! alasan \" oOo Chanyeol berbaring di kasur Baekhyun. Kamarnya tidak besar dan juga kasurnya juga bukan kasur empuk. Baekhyun? Ia terbaring di lantai dengan selimut yang menutupi tubuhnya. \"Kau yakin tidak kedinginan?\" \"Tidak\" \"Kita bisa berbagi tempat tidur\" \"Tidak perlu\" \"Kau yakin\" \"Ya Chanyeol ! Tidurlah !\" 'Hening' Suara dengkuran Baekhyun menemani malamnya Chanyeol. Cukup berisik memang tapi tidak menganggunya. Chanyeol melihat area kamar Baekhyun. Seperti kamar mandinya. Kamar Baekhyun juga dipenuhi poster sunbaenya yakni SNSD. Ia juga melihat beberapa album SNSD di meja belajarnya. Bahkan sprei yang ada pada kasur Baekhyun juga berlogo 'girls generation'. Chanyeol melihat kearah bawah. Ia melihat Baekhyun yang tertidur dengan bibir yang sedikit terbuka. Ia merasa sangat beruntung bertemu dengan Baekhyun. Jika saja ia tidak bertemu dengan Baekhyun. Mungkin nasibnya akan jauh lebih buruk dari ini. Ia berjanji. Jika besok ia menemukan penginapan tempat grup dan krunya menginap. Ia akan membalas semua kebaikan Baekhyun. \"Aku berjanji akan membawamu untuk bertemu dengan SNSD Baek.\" TBC Hai aku AQUA JUNG ini ff pertamaku di FFN . kalo mau lihat FF gambar bisa chek Ig : Chanbaekff09 'promosi dikit'[Chapter 2] Ini adalah cerita atau karya saya sendiri tanpa bantuan ide orang lain.

KALIMAT YANG BERGARIS MIRING ANGGAP SAJA ITU BAHASA THAILAND. HAHAHA HAPPY READING ANAK ANAKNYA CHANBAEK !! \"Aku berjanji akan membawamu untuk bertemu dengan SNSD Baek.\" oOo 'Keletang' Baekhyun bangun jam 4 sore. Seperti biasa ia memasak nasi, air, mencuci pakaian, membuat bekal, menyetrika pakaian sebelum ia pergi sekolah. Yaa.. Baekhyun masih sekolah. Tapi ia sudah bekerja di sebuah minimarket untuk membantu kebutuhannya disini. Orang tuanya? Entahlah.. ia dibesarkan di panti asuhan. orang tuanya telah bercerai. Ayahnya entah kemana dan ibunya tinggal jauh diKorea. sampai ia memberanikan diri tinggal jauh dari panti asuhan di sebuah gubuk kecil untuk ia tempati. Ia membeli rumah ini setelah ia mengumpulkan uang gajiannya. Walau kecil bagi orang lain. Tapi ini istana baginya. Ceklek \"Chan.. Chanyeol.. ini sudah siang\" \"Ehm..\" \"Bangunlah.. jika kau ingin sendirian disini\" \"Kau mau kemana Baek?\" \"Sekolah..\" Chanyeol mendudukan tubuhnya di ranjang dan melihat arah jarum jam yang pendeknya mengarah pukul 6. \"Kau pergi sekolah jam 6 pagi?\" \"Aku hanya ingin mengatakan padamu kalau aku akan pergi sekolah.. bukan aku akan pergi sekolah jam 6 !\" \"Ku kira kau sekolah jam 6. Ini kan masih gelap\" Baekhyun membelalakan matanya. Mana bisa orang bilang kalau jam 6 lewat 15 menit masih gelap. Yaa saat mereka masih dikamar memang gelap karna jendelanya masih tertutup rapat. Baekhyun mendorong jendela kayu untuk mempersilahkan sinar matahari masuk. \"Aish.. !! Kenapa kau buka bodoh ! Silau !\" \"Kau bilang ini gelap.. ini kuberi cahaya pagi untukmu !\" \"Mana tahu aku kalau di Thailand jam 6 sudah terang begini !\" Hah.. lagi lagi Baekhyun harus mengalah dengan Idol yang sok selalu benar ini. \"Baiklah ! Aku mandi dulu\" Baekhyun bangun dan mengambil handuknya di belakang pintu kamar. \"Tunggu .. Tunggu !!\" \"Apalagi ?!!\" \"Itukan handukku !\" 'Astaga.. apa idol ini lupa kalau ia tinggal dirumah orang lain. Yang tentu saja barang yang ia pakai itu juga milik orang lain ! ' yaa.. itulah fikiran Baekhyun. \"Kuingatkan padamu Park Chanyeol ssi. Member dari BoyGroup SKY yang berada di posisi visual, main rapper, aktor, dan model. Ku ingatkan sekali lagi padamu kalau kau itu... MENUMPANG DIRUMAH KU !!!!!\" 'Meonggg !!' 'Krakk kraaakk.' 'Cit cit cit' Berbagai hewan benar benar terkejut mendengar jeritan Baekhyun. Termasuk Chanyeol yang sedang menutup telinganya. Ia fikir kalau telinganya akan bermasalah setelah mendengar suara jeritan Baekhyun. \"Hah..hah\" baekhyun terengah. \"Ma..maaf.. aku hanya tidak terbiasa saat aku harus berbagi handuk dengan orang lain\" \"Astaga... seharusnya aku yang bilang begitu !\" \"Kalau begitu belikan aku handuk baru !\" \"Mana uangmu. Aku akan membelikannya\" \"Ahh.. sebentar\" Chanyeol merogoh sakunya. Jelas ! Tidak ada uang disana. Ia selalu menaruh uang di dompetnya. Dan dompetnya selalu ia masukkan di dalam tas kecilnya. Dan tas kecilnya selalu ia taruh di mobil van. Benar benar rumit. dan yang pasti IA TIDAK PUNYA UANG ! \"Tidak ada\" \"Sudah kuduga\" Baekhyun membuka pintu kamar dan meninggalkan Chanyeol yang terlihat sedih. Ia melirik kearah nakas di samping ranjang. Ada ponselnya disana. Tapi mati. Ia benar benar bernasib buruk. \"Apa aku terkena kutukan sampai aku melewati masa yang sulit seperti ini?\" oOo \"Kai .. apa kau bisa menghubungi Chanyeol?\" Kai menggeleng ia sudah ratusan kali menelfon Chanyeol tapi selalu gagal. Ia benar benar khawatir dengan sahabatnya itu. Apalagi tas kecil berharganya tertinggal di van. \"Aku telah mengirimnya pesan. Tapi tidak dibaca olehnya\" Sehun juga sudah melakukan hal yang sama dengan Kai. \"Astaga.. hari ini dia ada syuting\" \"Kita harus kembali ke Korea Lu. Bagaimana juga kita harus tetap kembali sesuai jadwal\" \"Lalu bagaimana dengan Chanyeol.. Kai?' \"Hah.. aku tidak tahu.. tapi kita harus menjaga nama baik grup kita kan?\" \"Lu.. sepertinya Kai benar. Kita harus kembali. \" Luhan terlihat bingung. Ia harus memilih keputusan sekarang. Pulang demi nama baik grup dan agensi tanpa Chanyeol. Atau pulang bersama Chanyeol tapi tidak tahu kapan Chanyeol akan kembali. Mereka seharusnya pulang tadi malam. Tapi karna Chanyeol tidak ada. Mereka menunda penerbangan mereka. Sampai seorang kru menghampiri mereka. \"Kapten ! Aku sudah melacak ponsel Chanyeol. Dan aku berhasil menemukan alamat terakhir yang ia datangi setelah syuting kemarin.\" \"Benarkah?! Dimana?!\" Luhan mengguncang kru itu. Ia benar benar senang saat ini. Seperti sebuah keajaiban yang datang secara tiba tiba. \"Aku melihatnya di sekitar Pabrik tahu di kota ini\" \"Pabrik tahu?\" Tanya Sehun Kai dan Luhan bersamaan. \"Yaa.. tapi ponsel itu sepertinya tidak aktiflagi. Karna Saat aku ingin melacak alamat lengkapnya sudah tidak bisa lagi\" \"Kau tidak sempat melihat denah jalannya?\" \"Aku hanya melihat tulisan Pabrik tahu. Dan saat aku ingin melihat denahnya. Aku gagal karna gps Chanyeol tidak aktif. \" \"Bukankah petunjuk pabrik tahu sudah cukup? Kita bisa mencari Pabrik tahu di sekitar kota ini\" Luhan mengangguk setuju dengan usulan Kai. Tapi kru itu menggeleng tidak setuju. \"Itu sulit. Karna ada 7 pabrik tahu di kota ini\" \"APA?!\" oOo Chanyeol dan Baekhyun berdiri di depan sebuah bangunan tua. Tentunya setelah mereka mandi dan sarapan. \"Kau yakin disini tempat kita bertemu semalam?\" Baekhyun mengangguk. \"Ku kira semalam ini sebuah gudang\" \"Bukan.. ini adalah pabrik tahu. Aku bekerja disini untuk mengambil dan mengantar tahu kepasar setiap pagi\" Chanyeol mengangguk. Tapi setelahnya ia terkejut. Setiap pagi? Tapi, bukankah Baekhyun harus sekolah?. \"Tapi kan kau sekolah Baek\" \"Ya.. tapi aku bisa mengatur waktuku. Kapan aku harus bekerja dan kapan waktu untukku sekolah\" \"Jadi maksudmu sekarang kau mulai bekerja?\" \"Tentu saja ! Kau fikir aku bekerja saat jam istirahat ?!\" \" PAN !\" Baekhyun tersentak ia melirik Chanyeol yang mulai panik karna ada orang lain yang menghampiri mereka. Ia tidak ingin ada orang yang tahu tentang identitasnya sebagai idol. Walau itu hanya sedikit kemungkinan. \"Pakai maskermu !\" Chanyeol mengangguk dan mulai memasang maskernya kembali. \" Ada 3 tong tahu yang harus kau antar\" \"Ehm.. \" \" Ini kuncinya \" Baekhyun mengambil kunci yang dilempar oleh sang pemilik. \" Omong omong siapa dia Pan ?\" Baekhyun gusar. Ia tidak berfikir sebelumnya untuk memperkenalkan Chanyeol di depan orang lain. \" Dia temanku \" \" Ahh.. senang bertemu denganmu \" Chanyeol melihat Baekhyun. Meminta bantuan maksudnya. Ia benar benar tidak tahu apa yang dikatakan oleh orang ini. \"Di..dia tidak bisa bahasa kita\" \" Hah ?\" \" Dia temanku dari Inggris. Jadi dia hanya bisa bahasa inggris.\" \" Ahh.. dia turis! \" \" Haha.. ahh sepertinya kami harus pergi sekarang. Come on richard\" Baekhyun memberi kode pada Chanyeol untuk mengikutinya. Chanyeol yang mengerti hanya bisa \"Yes..yes.. come on man !\" oOo Brrmm..brrrmmm.. Mobil pickup yang dikendarai oleh namja mungil dan namja tiang yang duduk manis di kursi penumpang sedang pergi menuju pasar. Chanyeol terlihat sedang melihat pemandangan kota kecil ini. Sedangkan namja mungil sedang fokus dalam kemudinya. 3 tong tahu yang ada dibelakang mereka siap diantar ketoko yang ada dipasar. Walau menempuh jarak yang lumayan jauh. Tapi tak masalah. Toh mereka menggunakan mobil untuk kesana. \"Kotamu indah Baek..\" \"Benarkah? Bagimu yang pertama kali datang memang indah. Tapi untukku yang sudah tinggal lama disini. Tempat ini biasa saja untukku\" Chanyeol mengangguk setuju. Kota Seoul yang indah bagi orang diluar sana. Tapi bagi Chanyeol itu semua tidak lebih dari tempat tinggal yang biasa saja. Yaa karna ia sudah bosan dengan semua itu. \"Kau sudah ke Korea Baek?\" \"Tentu.. ibuku orang Korea\" \"Eoh? Benarkah?\" Baekhyun menghela nafas. Dia fikir ia bisa bicara Korea itu dari siapa? Jika bukan dari orang terdekatnya (ibunya). Walaupun Chanyeol berfikir Baekhyun belajar bahasa Korea karna dia ingin bisa bicara dengan idolanya SNSD. kek Jung yang belajar bahasa Korea biar bisa ngobrol ama Kai ㅋㅋㅋ \"Lalu kenapa kau tinggal disini? Kenapa tidak di Korea?\" \"Orang tuaku bercerai\" \"Jadi kau ikut ayahmu?\" \"mungkin\" \"kau tidak tahu dimana ayahmu?\" \"tidak tahu\" \"kalau tidak tahu. seharusnya kau tinggal bersama ibumu\" \"tidak mau\" \"seharusnya kau..\" glek Chanyeol hendak bertanya lagi. Tapi ia urungkan karna melihat tatapan sinis dari Baekhyun. Yaa mungkin Baekhyun sedikit risih karna membicarakan masalah pribadinya. \"Ahh.. aku baru ingat Baek !\" Baekhyun menoleh sebentar melihat ekspresi terkejut Chanyeol. Lalu kembali melihat jalan. \"Kau punya ponsel kan?\" \"Tentu\" \"Bisa internet?\" \"Tentu saja.. kau fikir aku menonton snsd dari mana kalau tidak dari benda itu\" \"Bagus Baek ! Aku bisa memasukkan akun emailku kesana. Dan aku akan meminta bantuan lewat itu !\" Ckiiiitt Rem mendadak membuat Chanyeol dan tong di belakang mereka bergoyang. \"Benar Yeol ! Kenapa tidak dari kemarin !\" \"Ehm..\" Chanyeol mengangguk. Baekhyun mengambil tas dan mengeluarkan ponselnya. \"Ini \" \"Bagus.. kau menyetirlah dan aku akan melakukan tugasku\" Baekhyun mengangguk setuju. Jika Chanyeol pergi beban hidupnya jadi ikut pergi. \" Ini 3 tong tahu..\" \" Baiklah terima kasih Pan. Sepedamu aku taruh disamping \" \" Baiklah.. ini kunci mobilnya. \" Baekhyun pergi kearah samping toko dan mengambil sepeda yang diikat. \" Pan dia siapa ?\" Orang itu menunjuk Chanyeol yang sibuk dengan ponsel Baekhyun sambil berlompat lompat seperti orang gila. \" Dia temanku Richard \" \" Ahh.. dia bukan orang sini? \" Baekhyun menggeleng. \" Aku harus kesekolah paman \" \" Baiklah hati hati \" Baekhyun mendorong sepeda disamping tubuhnya menemui Chanyeol yang seperti orang gila dengan ponsel ditangannya. \"Kau sedang apa?\" \"tentu saja mencari sinyal bodoh !\" 'heol.. siapa yang dia bilang bodoh?! Sialan' batin Baekhyun \"Disini tidak ada sinyal\" \"Memang tidak ada\" \"APA?!\" \"Ayo naik. Aku akan terlambat kesekolah jika kita berdebat disini\" Chanyeol menurut ia memakai masker wajahnya lagi. Sambil menaiki sepeda Baekhyun. Hanya ada satu kursi untuk pengemudi sepeda. Jadi Chanyeol berdiri di belakang Baekhyun. . . . Klik Baekhyun mengunci ban sepedanya di parkiran sekolah. Dan Chanyeol masih sibuk dengan ponsel Baekhyun. \"Kau mendapat sinyal?\" \"Tidak. Ahh iya bagaimana caranya kau melihat video snsd jika sinyal disini saja sulit didapatkan?\" \"Ahh.. itu aku mendownloadnya.\" \"Berapa lama kau menunggu download an itu selesai?\" \"2 sampai 3 hari mungkin\" 'Aku akan mati disini' jika ini komik mungkin roh Chanyeol akan keluar dari tubuhnya. \" Pan !\" \"orang asing lagi\" \"kau yang orang asing bodoh !\" Seseorang menghampiri Baekhyun dan Chanyeol yang sedang berdebat kecil. \" Eoh? Pith kau disini? \" Namja mungil yang cukup manly itu mengangguk sambil melihat Chanyeol dengan mata yang mengintimidasi. \" Siapa dia? \" \" Temanku Richard \" Namja bernama Pith itu mengangguk lagi. Dan melihat Chanyeol dengan penuh selidik. Wajah yang tertutup masker pakaian yang cukup ketat (tentu saja ketat karna ia memakai pakaian Baekhyun) membuat Pith curiga. \" Ayo ke kelas Pan. \" Namja itu menarik tangan Baekhyun pergi meninggalkan Chanyeol sendirian dengan wajah terkejut. Ia lantas mengikuti Baekhyun dan temannya yang aneh itu. Sampai Ckiiiiittt \" Pan ! \" Seorang yeoja kali ini. Ia keluar dari mobilnya dan menghampiri Baekhyun dan juga Pith. \" Noph? Kenapa berhenti dijalan? \" \" Sudahlah Pith ! Aku ingin bicara dengan Pan ! \" Pith menedikkan bahu tak peduli. Sedangkan Chanyeol hanya terdiam memperhatikan Baekhyun dan kedua temannya itu dari jarak 3 meter. \" Pan ! Kau tahu boy group kesukaan ku SKY kan? Salah satu dari mereka hilang! \" Baekhyun terkejut tentu saja. Ia sudah tahu bahwa berita ini akan keluar tapi tidak secepat ini. Ia kira agensi mereka akan menutupi masalah ini. \" Si..siapa yang hilang? \" \" Chanyeol !!\" Chanyeol yang mendengar namanya disebut langsung sontak menuju Baekhyun dan bicara dengan bahasa Korea. \"Apa yang dikatakannya? Kenapa dia menyebut namaku? Apa aku ketahuan? Apa ada sesuatu dengan grupku? Atau aku..\" \"Stop !\" Baekhyun jengah mendengar pertanyaan Chanyeol yang mungkin tidak ada habisnya. Pith dan Noph hanya bengong melihat interaksi mereka. Walaupun Noph seperti merasa familiar dengan suara dan postur tubuh orang yang ada di hadapannya ini. \" Siapa dia Pan? Sepertinya aku mengenalnya \" Glek.. apa Baekhyun akan ketahuan oleh seorang yeoja ? Yang sekaligus penggemar berat dari SKY !!

Her short blonde hair and blue eyes seem to dance with rage. Her eyes skimming the streets. Next to her stood a tall golden skinned female, with long black hair that danced in the faint breeze. Disbite the blood red tips on her hair, she seemed to look harmless. One thing was common for both females, the blue eyes and the stern yet glarring gaze. What are they looking for? Most men watched their hips sway, while the ones who had matches tried their best to ignore them. The golden skinned female seemed to be taller, but more entergetic and faster. While the blonde seemed more focus and...angered? \"Pika, were going to be late.\" The bronze beauty spoke. Her velvet voice seemed so smooth. It could make a baby stop crying and fall to blissful sleep. The blonde glarred at her but nodded. \"Only a few more kilomiters. Then we'll be their.\" This time the other nodded. \"Let's get to it.\" They walked faster. Hips swayed to where it would hypnotise the purest of men. * (Kurta) I looked to the gate then back at Rose. She seemed to be in trance by the large dogs. Who seemed to be right at yhe gate staring at her. But wagging their tails. Rose really is a dog person. \"Pika, we should get this over with!\" I smiled at her excitment and nodded. We opened the large gates. All the dogs seemed to follow her, even after she shoed them away. She gave up and we walked into a room, we looked around. Everyone was in a uniform, I kinda felt out of place. Mostly because I'm wearing my white shirt that was usually under my tribal vest. Also I wore long black pants and some deep blue flats. Rose wore a bright red shirt, it didnt have a back but she still wore it. Despite my protest. She also wore deep blue skinny jeans and some black lace up boots that hit the bending in her knee. I looked to Rose to only see her look my way. \"Hear comes the head.\" She whispered, her voice barley aduiable. I acted has normal as posible and was met with a rather small looking girl. She had bright blue hair and blue eyes too. Is she the head? Not really suprised though, I mean come on. I've seen someone younger then her run a doctor fisility. \"You must be our boss?\" She smiled but nodded, a tall male came running up. He looked panicked and worried. Must be her bodie gaurd or something. Rose stood next to me, she wore a fake small smile. \"Yes, call me Neon. This is my body gaurd Dalzollene.\" We both nodded towards the male, we kept our hands behind our backs and stood straight. Showing we are more than just a woman. Dalzollene cleared his throat and made himseft more presentable. \"You must be the new recrutes. Before you start, both of you must take a test. Meet at NHL, be their Saturday at 5 sharp.\" We nodded our heads and kept tall. \"You are dissmised.\" We turned and left, Rose was hidding her sly smirk from the people waking bye. The plan starts now. Hey Guys, I hope you like. Chrollo will be in the next chapter. Also Gon is a girl along with Kurupika.[Chapter 2] Rose I landed onto the bed watching Pika read a new book. I should set her up on a date! Even if she dosent like the guy, it would still be more amusing then watching her read. I rolled over to my back, staring up at the ceiling. Now who is most combatible with the devil Kurta? Leorio...no, to annoying. Killua...no, he likes Gon. Maybe Hisoka...Hahah no. He is a pedifile perverted clown. Hisoka I sneezed, then whipped my nose. Now whos talking about me? Back to Rose What about the bookworm Spider? I persed my lips then began to scroll through my contacs. I found his name. Chrollo Lucifer the head of the spiders. Pika would kill me, na shell be fine. (Under line is Rose and Slant is Chrollo) Hey spider, you know that favor you owe me? yes? How would you like to fufil the favor and never speak of it again? It took him a little to respond. Must be thinking stuff over. I rolled my eyes, same old spider. Continue Would you go on a date with one of my friends? Her name is Kurupika and truthfully. She needs to get out more, also shes your type. On top of that she strong, independant, major bookworm, brave, and pretty close to you in strategy and intellegence. I stuffed my phone in my pockey and went to grab and apple. My bare feet hit the cool tiles as I approached my prey, a green granny smith apple. I pounced and began to devour my prey. Until my phone went off. I looked at the screen, my lips curved into a devilish smirk. One down, many more to go. I re-read his reply, my fingers scrolling through our conversation. Only one word, but that was enough. I looked at the word once more, then began to plan. All he wrote was. When? * \"Pika, you better eat your food, before I shove it dosn your throat!\" She nodded in panic, then engulfed the pancakes. I made some waffles and sat down in front of the golden female. Time to set the plan in motion.\"Nee, Pika-chan? You free on Sunday?\" She looked at me, cation yet curiosity played upon her face. So hesitant, yet strong minded. \"Yes?\" \"Good, Gon wanted to talk to you about some stuff. She said to meet her their at 7 in morn. Said it was important too.\" She sighed but nodded a small smile slipped onto her lips. Gon and Pika have a close friendship. Not had close has Killua and her. But they were all pretty close. \"Okay Ill be their.\" I smiled innocently and ate the rest of meh waffles. Now should I stalk Pika or Chrollo on Sunday. I mentally laughed, I can now just stalk both! * Kurupika I was walking down the street, I wore a blavk tank top and my white pants. The click of the heel from my flats, were in rythm. I scrolled through my phone. She said Gon wanted to meet at the cafè. But which one? My phone dinged. It's HunterxHunter cafè. Sorry for not telling you. I sighed, then let my fingers dance across the small annoying screen. It's okay and thanks. No problem. I stuffed the technology into my back pocket then went into the cafè. I began to look around until I saw some black hair. Gon? I walked up to the table and saw a tall male siting in the booth. His hair was loose but parted in the middle. He also had bandages around his head. My eyes traed to his hands, he was reading a book. The man was very good looking, I will say that. I was about to walk away unyil his eyes fixed on mine. They were a deep obsidion and they almost seemed... lifless? Then a small smile graced his lips. \"Hello are you Kurupika?\" I nodded, curiose on how this attractive male knew my name. He motioned me to sit, but I just shook my head. He persed his lips to a flat line. \"How do you know my name?\" The flat line was replace with a amused smile. \"Didnt Rose tell you?\" I felt my vision become red, so glad Im wearing contacts. The peices began to form, why she said Gon. Why she sent me hear and why she had that sly grin at dinner last night. I was about to whip out my phone but wanted answers. So I sat down and glarred at him. My arms crossed. \"Do tell me, why? Did she bribe, threaten you, or is it because you owe her a favor?\" He showed no emotion, all he did was mark his page in the book and set it down. He then floded his hands together. \"She was right you are interesting.\" I narrowed my eyes at his amused face. \"How about we do it this way. We meet hear every Sunday and you get to ask has many questions has possible.\" I felt my eyes widened. That would keep Rose off my back and some free time along with answers. Their is still alot I want to know about Rose. She dosent tell me anything. Well I really have no room to talk, but still. Her scars worry me. But whats in it for him? I turned my eyes back to a glare. \"Whats in it for you.\" \"Keeps me from being bored, along with having a break for a while.\" I persed my lips. \"Okay. Ill do it.\" His smile seemed to brighten. \"One rule though.\" His entire deminer seemed to darken. He was seriouse. I nodded telling him to continue. \"How ever questions you ask I get to ask the same amount.\" I just nodded no backing out now. ","Summary":" A tall beutiful blonde strode into town.

Main Cast : Bae Jinyoung (21), Lee Daehwi (20), Yoo Seonho (19), Lai Guanlin (20) . . . . . Chapter 1 Author POV Angin berhembus sedikit kencang malam itu di Los Angeles. Seorang pria duduk di kursi gantung yang ada di balkon kamarnya. Selimut tipis melingkar di punggungnya, menghalau angin yang akan membuatnya kedinginan. Di tangannya ada segelas cokelat panas yang tadi di buatkan oleh Bundanya. Matanya menatap langit malam dengan sayu. Berharap ada bintang jatuh malam ini, agar dia bisa membuat permohonan untuk memutar waktu. Memutar waktu sebelum dia putus dengan kekasihnya. Tepat sebulan sebelumnya, saat hubungannya kandas dengan kekasih pertamanya. \"Jangan bodoh Lee Daehwi, dia sudah mengkhianatimu.\" Pria bernama Daehwi itu bermonolog pada dirinya sendiri. Flashback on \" Kim Samuel!\" Pria itu berteriak memanggil seseorang yang tengah bermesraan dengan seorang gadis di taman. Pria yang bernama Samuel itu hanya menatap malas orang yang memanggilnya, \"Ada apa Daehwi?\" \" Ada apa katamu? Harusnya kau menjelaskan keadaan yang sekarang Sam! Kenapa kau bermesraan dengan gadis ini?\" Pria yang dipanggil Daehwi itu meminta penjelasan, matanya sudah memerah menahan kesal. \" Dia kekasihku.\" Jawab Samuel. \" Jika dia kekasihmu, lalu aku apa?\" \" Mantan kekasih. Jadi, ayo kita putus Daehwi, mulai hai ini kita tidak ada hubungan apapun lagi.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Samuel pergi dengan wanita tadi. Meninggalkan Daehwi yang mematung disana. Apa semudah itu bagi Samuel memutuskan hubungan mereka? Tanpa Daehwi sadari, ada seorang pria yang mengamatinya. Pria itu mengamati semua yang ada disana dengan seksama, tidak mau kehilangan satu momen pun. Dia terus mengamati Daehwi bahkan setelah Samuel sudah pergi. Saat melihat Daehwi duduk, ia mengambil ponsel disakunya. Lalu ia memfoto Daehwi, setelah itu ia kirimkan foto itu pada kontak yang bernama 'Mr. Snape'. Tidak sampai semenit menit setelah foto itu terkirim, pria itu menerima panggilan dari 'Mr. Snape'. \" Apa yang terjadi dengan Daehwi? Kenapa dia terlihat depresi seperti itu? Bregsek mana yang membuatnya seperti itu? Katakan semuanya padaku, Lai Guanlin!\" 'Mr. Snape' tadi berteriak pda pria yang mengamati Daehwi, atau mungkin sekarang pria itu bisa kita panggil dengan nama Guanlin. \" Calm down, Jinyoung. Calm Down.\" Guanlin bicara dengan sedikit kesal pada Jinyoung -si Mr. Snape-. Gendang telinganya hampir pecah karena teriakan Jinyoung. \" Katakan padaku, agar aku bisa membunuh brengsek yang membuat milikku seperti itu.\" Jinyoung bertanya dengan nada yang cukup menakutkan. \" Milikmu itu memergokki Samuel selingkuh, lalu Samuel langsung memutuskannya.\" Guanlin menjelaskan dengan singkat, sebenarnya kalimat itu terlalu panjang bagi Jinyoung. Guanlin hanya perlu menyebutkan nama Samuel agar Jinyoung bisa segera memberi balasan karena sudah menyakiti miliknya -Daehwi-. \" Tunggu perintah dariku.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Jinyoung memutuskan sambungan teleponnya, dan itu membuat Guanlin kesal. Jinyoung selalu seenaknya. Flashback off Sentuhan tangan pada bahunya membuyarkan Daehwi dari lamunannya. Ia mendongak menatap orang yang menyentuh bahunya. Itu Bundanya. Daehwi tersenyum pada Bundanya, seperti ingin mengatakan bahwa dia baik-baik saja sekarang. Tapi insting seorang ibu tidak bisa dibohongi, Bunda Daehwi tau anaknya itu masih bersedih. Daehwi sedikit menggeser duduknya, memberikan ruang untuk Bundanya. Setelah Bundanya duduk, Daehwi langsung menyenderkan kepalanya pada bahu Bundanya. Dia sedang ingin bermanja-manja dengan wanita yang paling dia cintai itu. Tanpa berkata apapun Bunda Daehwi mengelus kepala anaknya pelan, menunggu anaknya bicara tentang perasaannya sekarang. \"Bunda..\" Daehwi sepertinya akan memulai sesi curhatnya. \"Kenapa Daehwi-ya?\" \"Bunda, kenapa aku terus mengingatnya?\" \"Karena hatimu menyayanginya dengan tulus, Sayang.\" Daehwi POV \"Tapi Bunda..\" \"Tapi apa Daehwi?\" \"Aku harus melupakannya, Bunda. Dia sudah melakukannya, aku juga harus.\" \"Kalau begitu, pergilah, Sayang. Cari orang yang bisa membuatmu lupa akan dirinya.\" Benar kata Bunda, aku harus mencari orang yang bisa membuatku lupa akan dirinya. Tapi siapa orang itu? Bahkan dalam waktu sebulan ini aku belum bisa melupakan Samuel sedikitpun. Lalu, bagaimana aku bisa mencari orang lain? -==JinHwi==- \"Kau sudah mau pulang Seonho?\" Aku bertanya pada Seonho yang sudah mengemasi bukunya. \"Iya. Sepertinya otak jeniusmu hanya bekerja saat pagi sampai sore saja. Saat malam kau hanya memikirkan mantan kekasihmu itu saja.\" Mendengar jawaban Seonho yang memang 'sedikit' benar itu aku merasa bersalah. Sepertinya tugas kami tidak akan selesai dengan cepat. \"Jika kau merasa bersalah, besok datanglah sedikit pagi agar otak jeniusmu bisa kita manfaatkan.\" Seoho mengatakan itu saat membuka pintu kamarku. \"Sudah dua bulan Lee Daehwi, cepat lupakan dia.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Seonho langsung keluar. Sudah dua bulan ya ternyata. Aku merebahkan tubuhku ditempat tidur, rasanya dingin dan hampa. Seperti terkurung di sebuah ruangan kosong tanpa pintu keluar. Seperti itulah yang aku rasakan sekarang. Tuhan, kapan aku bisa melupakannya? Aku memejamkan mata sebentar. Ya, hanya sebentar karena saat aku akan tertidur perutku berbunyi. Aku belum makan malam ya tadi. Ini sudah lewat satu jam dari jam makan malam. Tapi kenapa Bunda tidak memanggilku? Biasanya dia selalu memanggilku saat jam makan. Ah, entahlah. Aku ingin turun saja untuk mengisi perut. Selesai makan, aku ke kamar Bunda. Aku khawatir Bunda sakit, karena tidak biasanya dia tidak memanggilku saat jam makan. \"Bunda di dalam?\" Aku bertanya tanpa mengetuk pintu, dan tanpa menunggu jawaban Bunda aku langsung masuk ke dalam. Melihat aku masuk Bunda yang tengah melepon seseorang langsung memutuskannya dengan sedikit buru-buru. Siapa yang ditelepon Bunda? Tidak biasanya dia menelepon seseorang dengan raut wajah serius seperti itu. Entahlah, aku hanya ingin mengecek keadaan Bunda sekarang. Aku menghampiri Bunda yang duduk diujung tempat tidur, \"Bunda sakit?\" \"Tidak. Kenapa Sayang?\" Aku menggeleng pelan, \"Bunda tidak memanggilku untuk makan malam.\" Bunda tertawa geli. Sudah berapa lama aku tidak melihatnya seperti ini? Sepertinya sudah lama sekali tidak melihat ekspresi Bunda seperti sekarang. Bunda menepuk pahanya, menyuruhku untuk merebahkan kepala disana. Apa ini saat bermanja-manja lagi, Bunda? Aku segera merebahkan kepalaku disana, nyaman sekali rasanya. Apalagi saat Bunda mengelus rambutku. \"Seonho kan disini.\" Bunda memulai pembicaraan. \"Apa hubungannya makan malamku dengan Seonho?\" Aku bertanya bingung. Makan malamku tidak ada hubungannya dengan si byeongari itu, sepertinya. \"Dia makan lima kali sehari. Dan jika dia disini dia tetap tidak akan melupakan makannya. Jadi Bunda pikir tidak perlu memanggilmu, pasti Seonho yang akan menagih makan malamnya. Jadi kalian akan makan tanpa panggilan dari Bunda.\" Bunda menjelaskannya padaku. Benar juga, aku lupa jika byeongari itu adalah tukang makan. Aku dan Bunda terdiam setelah itu. Bunda masih betah mengelus rambutku, sesekali mengusap pipiku. Bibirnya bergumam kecil menyanyikan lagu Twinkle Twinkle Little Star . Aku benar-benar menyukai saat-saat seperti ini. \"Bunda..\" \"Ada apa, Sayang?\" \"Aku tidak bisa menemukannya.\" \"Menemukan apa?\" \"Menemukan orang yang bisa membuatku lupa akan dirinya.\" \"Bukan tidak bisa, kau hanya belum bertemu orang yang tepat, Sayang.\" \"Aku lelah, Bunda. Aku sudah bertemu banyak orang, tapi belum ada satupun yang membuatku benar-benar melupakannya.\" \"Dekati mereka dengan senyumanmu. Pikat mereka dengan sifatmu. Buat mereka jatuh, maka mereka dengan sendirinya akan membuatmu lupa akan dirinya.\" \"Aku tidak bisa melakukan itu, Bunda.\" \"Kenapa tidak bisa? Kau yang terbaik melakukan itu, Sayang.\" \"Benarkah itu?\" \"Itu benar, Sayang. Bunda dan mendiang Ayahmu adalah orang yang selalu terpikat olehmu, bahkan sampai akhir hayat.\" Aku berpikir sebentar, lalu menggelengkan kepalaku cepat. \"Aku sudah melakukan itu, tapi tetap saja...\" Bunda menggenggam tanganku dan tersenyum lembut. \"Gunakan hatimu, Sayang. Jangan kau gunakan nafsumu itu.\" Aku kembali terdiam untuk berpikir sejenak, lalu tersenyum senang. \"Aku sudah menemukannya!\" Seruku senang. \"Benarkah? Siapa orang itu, Sayang?\" \"Orang itu adalah Bunda.\" Bunda tersenyum mendengar jawabanku. \"Bunda akan membantumu mencari orang itu, Sayang. Agar dia bisa menjagamu saat Bunda tidak ada disini.\" Aku memiringkan kepalaku, bingung. \"Memang Bunda ingin pergi kemana?\" \"Ke sana, ke tempat yang jauh.\" \"Aku ikut, Bunda. Aku tidak ingin sendirian disini.\" Bunda menggeleng cepat, lalu mengelus rambutku. \"Kamu tidak akan sendirian, Sayang. Bunda akan mencarikan orang yang bisa menggantikan Bunda untuk menjagamu dan mendengar keluh kesahmu.\" -==JinHwi==- Tidak seperti biasanya, hari ini Bunda sangat berbeda. Biasanya dia akan membangunkanku dengan sedikit tidak berperikeanakan. Tapi pagi ini, Bunda membangunkanku dengan mengelus kepalaku sampai aku bangun karena terusik. Bunda biasanya hanya memberikan smoothie strawberry banana dan uang jajan saat aku akan pergi kuliah. Tapi hari ini berbeda. Bunda memberikan bekal makan siang juga untukku. Kenapa hari ini Bunda sangat baik padaku? Bahkan uang jajanku hari ini dua kali lipat. \"Daehwi! Dalam lima menit tidak turun kutinggal kau!\" Itu suara Seonho. Ya, kita memang suka berangkat bersama. Lagipula rumah Seonho dan rumahku itu berdampingan. \"Bunda aku berangkat ya.\" Aku berteriak sambil memakai sepatuku didepan pintu. Walaupun kami tinggal di Los Angeles, tapi dalam kehidupan kami, kami memakai adat Korea. Ya, salah satunya adat beralas kaki ini. Beruntung keluarga si byeongari itu juga berdarah korea, jadi dia punya teman untuk diajak bicara Korea selain Bunda. Saat aku akan membuka pintu, tanganku ditarik oleh Bunda. Lalu tiba-tiba Bunda memelukku, erat sekali. Sampai dadaku sesak rasanya. \"Bunda sangat menyayangimu. Apapun yang Bunda lakukan itu untuk kebaikan kita.\" Itu kata Bunda setelah melepaskan pelukannya. Aku tersenyum menanggapi, \"Aku lebih menyayangi Bunda.\" \"Tunggu sebentar Daehwi-ya, Bunda akan membuatmu bahagia dan melupakan Samuel.\" Saat aku ingin membalas ucapan Bunda, Seonho berteriak memanggil namaku dengan kesal diluar sana. Anak itu benar-benar pengacau suasana. \"Kita lanjutkan nanti ya Bunda, Seonho akan membunuhku jika aku tidak segera keluar.\" Setelah mengatakan itu, aku mencium pipi Bunda dan segera keluar menemui Seonho. Author POV \"Kenapa kau lama sekali? Hah?\" Seonho berteriak kesal pada Daehwi yang baru sampai didepannya. \"Maaf, tadi ada acara peluk-memeluk dulu.\" Setelah berkata seperti itu Daehwi segera naik ke boncengan di sepeda Seonho. Ya, seperti itu lah mereka biasanya berangkat kuliah. Sepanjang perjalanan Seonho terus mengeluh tentang Daehwi yang belum melupakan Samuel. Padahal, Samuel sendiri sudah berganti pacar setidaknya tiga kali, itu belum termasuk selingkuhannya. Semenjak putus dari Daehwi, Samuel menjelma menjadi playboy. Daehwi hanya mengangguk-angguk mendengar keluhan sahabatnya itu. Sudah sebulan ini Seonho selalu mengeluh tentang ini. Bahkan saat sekarang, saat pelajaran dari dosen yang terkenal mengerikan dijurusannya, Seonho masih terus mengeluh. Tidak dengan mulutnya, tapi dengan tulisan dibuku. Ya, Seonho akan menulis lalu menunjukkannya pada Daehwi, respon Daehwi masih sama seperti tadi. Mr. Hatson mengakhiri pelajarannya hari ini. Melihat itu, Daehwi langsung mengambil ponselnya disaku celana. Sudah sejak tadi ponselnya bergetar, tapi Daehwi tidak ingin melihatnya. Dia tidak ingin dimarahi oleh Mr. Hatson karena bermain ponsel disaat jam pembelajaran. 11 Missed Call from Number Unknown Daehwi mengecek nomor yang meneleponnya. Itu semua dari nomor yang sama. Dan nomor ini tidak kelihatan seperti nomor ponsel. \"Seonho, kau tahu ini nomor apa?\" Daehwi bertanya pada Seonho. \"Itu nomor rumah sakit tempat Uncle Jordan bekerja. Pamanku yang dokter itu.\" \"Rumah sakit?\" Daehwi kembali memastikan jawaban Seonho. Seonho hanya mengangguk membenarkan. Saat makan siang di taman, Daehwi mencoba menghubungi nomor telepon rumah sakit tadi. Sebenarnya dia ingin menelepon dari tadi, tapi Seonho menariknya ke taman untuk makan siang. \" Hello, here Ronald UCLA Medial Center. Can I help you?\" \"Hello, I'm Lee Daehwi. Earlier I got a call from this number, but I was not able to receive a call.\" \" Lee Daehwi?\" Orang dari rumah sakit itu memastikan nama Daehwi. \"Yes, I'm Lee Daehwi.\" \" You better come here as soon as possible, this is urgent and can't be said over the phone.\" Ucapan dari pegawai rumah sakit itu membuat Daehwi khawatir. Semenjak Ayahnya meninggal, Daehwi tidak pernah berhubungan dengan rumah sakit lagi. \"Yes, I'll be ridght there. Thank You.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Daehwi segera mengemasi makan siangnya. Dia melihat sekeliling mencari byeongari nya. Biasanya si byeongari itu akan berkeliling melihat bekal makan siang teman-teman yang lain. Tapi karena tidak menemukan orang yang dicari, Daehwi langsung pergi dari sana. Ia segera mencari taksi untuk mengantarnya ke rumah sakit itu. -==JinHwi==- Setelah sampai di rumah sakit, Daehwi langsung menuju ke resepsionis dan menyebutkan namanya. Dari suara resepsionis itu, Daehwi tau wanita didepannya ini yang tadi meneleponnya. Setelah Daehwi menyebutkan namanya, Daehwi langsung diminta ke sebuah ruangan di rumah sakit itu. Suasana yang dilihat Daehwi sekarang tidak asing baginya, dulu saat ayahnya meninggal. Saat otaknya belum mengerti apa-apa, matanya sudah mengeluarkan air matanya. Orang yang ada disana asing bagi Daehwi, tapi tidak dengan suasananya. Ada seorang dokter bername tag Jackson Wang, ada seorang pemuda yang tidak Daehwi kenal, dan ada pasien di ranjang yang sekujur tubuhnya ditutupi kain putih. Seseorang meremas kedua bahunya pelan dari belakang, tapi Daehwi enggan menoleh. Dia lebih fokus pada pasien yang sudah meninggal itu. \"Dia Bundamu.\" Ucap seseorang dibelakang Daehwi Mendengar itu, Daehwi lemas seketika. Badannya terduduk dilantai, kakinya gemetar karena syok. Dia menangis sekeras yang ia bisa. Mengeluarkan semua rasa perih dan sakit didadanya. Pria dibelakang Daehwi segera memeluknya, mencoba menenangkan Daehwinya. \"Kenapa kau harus pergi?! Kau tahu aku benci sendirian!\" \"Biarkan dia pergi, tersenyumlah untuknya, bukan malah menangis.\" \"Tapi aku benci sendirian. Aku benci dia meninggalkanku seperti ini.\" \"Kau tidak akan sendirian, aku akan selalu ada untukmu.\" Ucapan pria itu membuat Daehwi mendongak menatapnya. \"Siapa kau?\" Daehwi bertanya dengan nada sedikit tidak suka. Memangnya siapa pria itu sampai dia bisa mengatakan hal seperti itu? Siapapun pria itu, dia akan masuk dalam list orang yang Daehwi benci. \"Aku orang yang akan menjagamu.\" Pria itu tersenyum lembut pada Daehwi, dan itu membuat Daehwi sedikit merona karena pria itu terlihat tampan baginya. Hey Daehwi, bukankah tadi kau bilang akan memasukkan dia ke dalam list yang kau benci? Lalu kenapa kau terpesona dengannya? Daehwi menundukkan kepalanya, \"Aku sendirian sekarang.\" Dia bergumam pada dirinya sendiri. Daehwi POV \"Maka dari itu aku ada disini, untuk menjagamu selamanya. Sampai maut memisahkan, ah, tidak. Bahkan saat maut menjemputmu, aku akan menyusulmu.\" \"Kau berlebihan. Memalukan tahu mendengar itu darimu.\" Dia tertawa kecil, wajah kecilnya itu terlihat tampan saat tertawa. \"Perkenalkan, namaku Bae Jinyoung. Orang yang akan menggantikan Bunda mu.\" \"Jangan harap kau bisa melakukan itu.\" \"Aku perlu tahu namamu, Sayang.\" Aku berdecih mendengarnya memanggilku sayang. Hanya Bunda yang boleh melakukan itu, tahu! \"Namaku Lee Daehwi.\" Aku sedikit terhibur sekarang. Setidaknya bebanku sedikit terangkat karena ucapan manis dari pria bernama Jinyoung itu. Dia seperti obat penenangku sekarang. Tapi, sebenarnya Jinyoung itu siapa? -==JinHwi==- Aku bangun dari tidur karena suara ketukan pintu yang mengganggu. Hanya ada tiga kemungkinan orang yang ada diluar sana, yang sedang mengetuk pintu. Pertama, si byeongari , Yoo Seonho. Kedua, pria dengan gummy smile nya, anak buah si pria menyebalkan di rumah sakit, Lai Guanlin. Ketiga, si pria menyebalkan, Bae Jinyoung. Seminggu ini, mereka selalu merecoki istirahatku. Padahal kan aku ingin melepas kesedihanku dengan tidur. Tapi dari kedatangan tiga tamu itu, hanya Seonho yang aku persilakan masuk. Guanlin? Setiap pagi dia membangunkanku dengan nyanyiannya di depan pintu dan akan di depan rumahku sampai Seonho datang sepulang kuliah. Seonho akan berada di rumahku saat pulang kuliah sampai jam malamnya berakhir, sekitar pukul 11. Setelah itu si Bae menyebalkan Jinyoung yang datang, dia akan duduk didalam mobilnya yang diparkir semalam suntuk didepan rumahku. Dan begitulah kejadiannya terulang selama seminggu ini. Aku membuka pintu yang menuju balkon. Jinyoung yang datang. Ya, walaupun aku tidak bisa melihat orang yang ada didepan pintu rumahku, tapi aku melihat mobil Jinyoung dipinggir jalan. Nah, kan, aku bilang apa. Hanya ada tiga orang yang akan mengganggu pagiku. Trio menyebalkan itu. \"Aku sudah bangun!\" Aku berteriak dari balkon. Orang didepan pintu itu berjalan mundur, lalu mendongak menatapku diatas. Dia tersenyum, ya, dia. Bae Jinyoung. \"Wajahmu bahkan lebih merah dari kepiting rebus, Hwi!\" Aku melirik kesal pada Seonho yang sedang tertawa tidak jelas di balkon rumahnya. Kenapa anak itu suka sekali sih menggodaku saat Jinyoung datang. Dasar byeongari itu. \"Awas saja kau byeongari !\" Setelah berteriak seperti itu pada Seonho aku masuk ke dalam untuk bersiap pergi kuliah, aku rindu suasana kuliah. Aku sudah bilang pada Seonho kemarin kalau aku ingin kuliah hari ini. Setelah bersiap aku langsung turun ke bawah dan segera memakai sepatu. Aku tidak sarapan ataupun membawa smoothie kesukaanku. Aku tidak bisa memasak dan membuat smoothie senikmat buatan Bunda. Bunda, aku rindu. Aku melihat Jinyoung duduk di teras rumah. Dia terlihat aneh hari ini karena memakai pakaian kasual. Selama ini aku hanya melihatnya memakai pakaian fomal tanpa dasi. Tapi tetap saja, jika dilihat hanya dari wajahnya, dia terlihat tampan. Ah, aku mulai melantur lagi bicaranya. Lupakan apa yang aku katakan tadi, oke? \"Untuk apa kau kesini? Aku kemarin sudah bilang kan kalau aku akan masuk kuliah hari ini.\" Ucapku pada Jinyoung. Ya, kemarin malam saat Seonho pulang aku minta dia menyampaikan psanku ini pada Jinyoung yang sudah stand by didepan rumah. Jinyoung mendongak menatapku, \"Aku akan mengantarmu.\" \"Aku berangkat dengan Seonho.\" Aku berusaha menolak. Aku merasa tidak nyaman dengan pria menyebalkan ini. \"Seonho berangkat denganku.\" Aku mengikuti arah pandang Jinyoung ke mobilnya, si byeongari itu bahkan sudah masuk ke dalam mobil pria menyebalkan ini. -==JinHwi==- Author POV Dan disinilah mereka bertiga, di dalam mobil Jinyoung. Seonho sibuk dengan buku-bukunya di kursi belakang. Sedangkan Jinyoung fokus menyetir. Daehwi? Dia sedang amat-sangat-bosan sekarang, biasanya dia dan Seonho akan mengobrol hal tak penting. Tapi hari ini Seonho jadi pendiam sekali, Daehwi kan jadi bingung harus apa didalam mobil selain menatap jalanan. \"Disini kan gedung kalian?\"Jinyoung bertanya saat mereka sampai di gedung jurusan Daehwi dan Seonho. \"Iya, terima kasih Jinyoung-ssi.\" Setelah mengucapkan itu Seonho turun dari mobil. \"Kau kelihatan lebih baik memakai pakaian kasual seperti ini.\" Jinyoung bingung dengan ucapan Daehwi yang tiba-tiba itu, sepertinya dia harus berterima kasih pada Guanlin yang merekomendasikan pakaian ini. \"Terima kasih.\" Jinyoung mengucapkan terima kasih karena dia senang mendapat pujian dari Daehwi. Sudut bibirnya naik dari tadi, dia merasa senang hari ini. \"Sudah mengantarku dan Seonho.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Daehwi turun dan menyusul Seonho yang sedang mengobrol dengan teman-temannya yang lain. Perlu setidaknya satu menit bagi Jinyoung untuk memahami maksud Daehwi. Setelah paham dia hanya tertawa geli. Tadi itu Daehwi ingin mengucapakan terima kasih? Kenapa tidak langsung saja, sih? Memang benar-benar, Daehwi itu tsundere yang sangat lucu dimata Jinyoung. Melihat Daehwi masih disekitar sana, Jinyoung turun dan menghampirinya dan membawa botol minuman. \"Hwi.\" Panggil Jinyoung pada pria bermarga Lee itu. Daehwi menatap Jinyoung yang tepat ada disampingnya, teman-temannya yang lain pun juga ikut memperhatikan. Tentu saja mereka memperhatikan, Jinyoung itu tampan. Wanita mana yang tidak akan tertarik padanya? \"Untukmu. Aku akan menjemputmu disini pukul 2 nanti.\" Setelah mengatakan itu Jinyoung memberikan botol minumnya pada Daehwi. Lalu, Jinyoung langsung pergi dengan mobilnya. \"Sepertinya akan ada pasangan baru.\" Nah, kan, Seonho kembali menggodanya. \"Enyahlah kau byeongari menyebalkan!\" Daehwi langsung pergi dengan kaki yang dihentakkan karena kesal. Seonho? Dia bergegas menyusul Daehwi, temannya itu jika sudah kesal akan lama. Jadi dia harus merayu agar Daehwi memaafkannya. Temannya yang lain melihat mereka dengan geli, dua sahabat berdarah Korea itu adalah maskot dari jurusan mereka. \"Daehwi jangan marah padaku.\" Seonho memeluk lengan Daehwi erat, sepertinya pria bermarga Lee tidak akan memaafkannya begitu saja. \"Lee Daehwi!\" Teriakan dari seseorang itu menghentikan acara mari-minta-maaf-pada-Daehwi nya Seonho. Daehwi dan Seonho menatap orang diujung lorong itu dengan pandangan yang sulit diartikan. \"Aku perlu bicara denganmu, Daewhi-ya.\" Ucap orang itu begitu sampai didepan Daehwi dan Seonho. \"Apa kita ada topik untuk dibicarakan Kim Samuel?\" Daehwi bertanya dengan nada daternya, sedikit menekankan nama pria bule didepannya ini. \"Ada.\" \"Oh ya? Tapi aku rasa tidak.\" Seonho menyela obrolan mereka, dia sejak awal tidak pernah menyukai pria Kim itu. \"Jangan ikut campur kau byeongari .\" Samuel menatap Seonho kesal, Daehwi menatap Samuel lebih kesal lagi. Hanya Daehwi yang boleh memanggil Seonho byeongari . \"Pergilah jika kau tidak ingin aku mengamuk disini.\" Daehwi menarik tangan Seonho, dia serius dengan ucapannya. Dia tidak ingin mengamuk Samuel saat keadaan ramai begini. Mereka sekarang menjadi pusat perhatian. Samuel melepas genggaman tangan Daehwi pada Seonho, lalu dia menarik Daehwi pergi dari sana. Samuel butuh tempat sepi sekarang, dan dia tau dimana tempat itu. Seonho menatap mereka dengan marah, lebih tepatnya marah pada Samuel. Saat mereka sudah cukup jauh Seonho bergegas menyusul mereka, tapi ada yang menahan tangannya. \"Keparat kau! Lepaskan-... Eh?\" Seonho menatap orang yang menahan tangannya itu dengan pandangan aneh. \"Milikmu.\" Orang itu menyerahkan buku Seonho, lalu melihat ke arah lorong dimana Samuel membawa Daehwi. \"Mereka ada digudang atas. Lurus lalu belok kiri, disana ada tangga. Naik dua lantai lalu ke arah kanan, pintu terakhir itu gudangnya. Didekat laboratorium.\" Setelah Seonho mengucapkan itu, Orang itu segera mengikuti arahan Seonho. Seonho? Dia mulai dikerubungi oleh kaum hawa yang butuh bahan gosip, Seonho itu narasumber terpercaya di jurusan ini. -==JinHwi==- \"Lepaskan aku Kim!\" Daehwi terus berteriak saat Samuel menarik tangannya, dia yakin tangannya sangat merah sekarang. Setelah sampai di gudang, Samuel baru melepaskan tangan Daehwi. Lalu dia menghimpit Daehwi di tembok. Dia mencium leher Daehwi dengan ganas, dan juga ditambah dia menggigitnya. Daehwi merasakan perih di lehernya, Samuel pasti akan membuat banyak luka ditubuhnya. Bruk! Samuel tersungkur di lantai karena seseorang mendorongnya. Bukan, itu bukan Daehwi. Melihat Daehwi terdiam dengan baju sedikit terkoyak dan leher penuh bekas gigitan orang itu terlihat murka pada Samuel. Segera ia memukul Samuel dengan membabi buta. Samuel balas memukul sebisanya. Dia sebenarnya kalah telak dari orang itu. \"Siapa kau?\" Samuel berteriak marah pada orang itu. \"Kau tidak perlu tahu siapa aku, yang perlu kau tahu Daehwi itu tanggung jawabku. Dan aku diperbolehkan menghabisi orang yang macam-macam dengannya.\" . . . . . TBC TBC dulu yak, capek ngetiknya. Masih ada yang gantung kan itu, kita lanjut di chapter selanjutnya nanti. Minta kritik dan sarannya boleh? Oh iya, review ya^^ Thank You /bow/ . . . . . . . . . . Btw, ada yang mau nebak orang yang mukulin Samuel itu siapa?-\" ","Summary":" Rhefoxx Present I'm Here An DeepHwi / Jinhwi fanfiction ... ... ... Prolog \"Bunda, kenapa aku teru"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"The Fallen Night","Author":"xxMsMegan95xx","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7217771","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Okay, here's one in Tribeca for three thousand.\" Paige pointed out. Carly looked hopeless. \"That's still way too much. All the money I saved up won't even cover two months' rent. I'm going to have to work every minute I'm not in class until graduation.\" Carly put down the newspaper and rubbed her temples. \"Carly, don't you even think about not going!\" Riley said looking up at Carly. \"I'm not.\" She said \"Good. Because you know how proud we are of you.\" Paige said while Riley nodded in agreement. \"It's just an internship,\" Riley stopped Carly before she could continue, \"At InStyle magazine!\" Paige nodded, \"Or you could just stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" Seeing the disgusted look on Carly's face Riley knew what she was thinking. Scrunching her nose just at the thought, \"No, thanks.\" \"Yeah, that's what I thought. Now pass me the paper beside you.\" Riley said pointing to the paper under Carly's elbow. The girls were so engulfed in looking at the paper to notice Wade sit down next to Carly. \"Hey, babe,\" Dropping a kiss on Carly's forehead before smiling at Paige and Riley. \"Hi.\" \"Sorry, there were two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.\" Wade said turning to face Carly. Seeing the two talk to each other, Paige put down the paper, \"I'm going to go see what Blake's doing,\" She got up and fixed her shirt taking note of the car he was in, \"He seems to like that car more than me nowadays.\" With Paige gone, it just left the three sitting there in the awkward silence. \"Alright, I can take a hint.\" Smiling down at the two she set off to see what Nick was up too. She stopped short of the building door to see him picking on a poor homeless man; typical Nick. \"Babe, leave him alone.\" Riley walked over to Nick and pulled on his arm. But, he still had to be an ass and kick the cup out of his hands. Smiling he wrapped his arms around her waist, grazing her stomach before kissing her exposed neck, \"Sorry.\" Pushing to get out of his grasp, she rolled her eyes, \"No, you're not.\" Riley grabbed Nick's arm, pulling him in the direction she just came from. When they reached the table, Wade looked up with wide eyes when Nick, Riley, and Dalton sat down at the table. Giving the look that told Riley that Carly and Wade were probably just talking about Nick. Wade and Nick never really got along, and Wade was a little shocked to find out he was coming with them to the game. \"So, what do you think guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?\" Wade nervously said trying to break some of the tension. \"Yeah,\" Nick mumbled. Riley elbowed him in his ribs to keep him from saying anything further. \"Dalton, please don't film me.\" Carly covered her face in attempt to get Dalton to turn the camera off. Acting like nothing was going on Dalton spoke, \"What,\" laughing, \"I'm not filming now.\" \"The red light is on, dumbass.\" Riley said, kicking Dalton under the table hoping he would just put down the damn camera. \"Put the camera down,\" Nick said pushing the camera down toward the table, \"She doesn't like having people up in her face. She folds under pressure.\" Great, here we go. \"You got something to say to me?\" Carly yelled while her eyes turned to slits as she looked over at Nick. Matching Carly's actions Nick replied, \"No, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?\" Alright, that was Riley's queue to get Nick away. Rolling her eyes, Riley got up from the table taking Nick's hand in hers, \"Come on Nick.\" Seeing Dalton with the camera still in his hand just pissed Nick off more, \"Dalton put down the camera. God.\" When Nick and Riley were out of ear shot Riley pushed Nick against the car, \"Why do you have to be an ass?\" \"Because the guys a douche!\" Nick grabbed Riley's hips to pull her closer, playing with the hem of her shirt. \"Can you please, just please, try and keep the peace?\" Seeing the expressionless look on Nick's face she knew that it wasn't going to happen. \"If anything just during the car ride?\" Riley placed her hands on his chest and looked into his eyes, pleading with him. \"We'll see.\" Knowing that was the best she was going to get from him, she just smiled at him and placed her lips on his. \"Thank you.\" She said pulling back and just holding him in a hug. xxxxx \"… Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year…\" \"Man, it's gonna be packed tomorrow.\" Speaking of things being packed only made Riley's legs hurt. She was currently squashed between Nick and Dalton in the limited space in the back of Wade's car. Trying to make this as comfortable as possible, Nick placed his arm around Riley, so she could scoot closer to Nick, giving a little more room for the bigger people in the back. \"Speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man.\" Dalton said groaning for the thousandth time since they've been in the car. \"Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.\" \"Nick, seriously, shut the fuck up!\" Riley yelled while elbowing him in the ribs once again. Rubbing his chest, he looked down at Riley and just shrugged not knowing what he did wrong. Laughing at Nick's comment, Dalton went in to add his two sense, \"What did you do, go to the barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut?\" Finally speaking up Carly turned around to glare at Dalton, \"Shut up, Dalton.\" \"Okay, so who wants to play the quite game?\" Riley said clasping a hand over Nick's mouth to keep him from saying anything. xxxxxx After what seemed like hours being jammed in the back of Wade's car, someone finally spoke up. \"So much for his nice little shortcut.\" Seeing the car turn toward a new direction, Riley could feel her nerves start up; she was never the one to like woods. She grabbed Nick's hand for a little reassurance. \"Oh, my god.\" \"Look at her. Look at her!\" \"You're caught on tape.\" Hearing the murmurs start up in the car, Riley turned to the car next to them only to find Paige going to town on Blake. \"Look at his face!\" \"You are so busted.\" Carly said laughing into the phone. \"Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm.\" Paige said from the car holding up her lip balm to prove her innocence. \"She says she dropped her lip balm.\" Carly said relaying the message to the others in the car. \"Yeah, right.\" Riley said rolling her eyes at the blonde. In a desperate need to change the subject Carly asked, \"So, what's up?\" Pulling the phone away from her mouth Paige looked over at Blake, \"It's getting late, what do you wanna do?\" Rolling his head to look at Paige, \"Keep going, we don't even have tickets.\" He said like it was the only option they had. Riley leaned closer into Nick, not liking where this conversation was going. \"Why don't we just camp out? We're close enough, right?\" Just what Riley had hoped she wouldn't say. Riley looked over into Blake's car, hoping Blake would shake his head no and decide to keep going. But, he shook his head yes and they we're pulling on to another dirt road. \"Hey, wax museum.\" Wade said driving by and pointing to a sign. Never the one to pass up an opportunity Nick chirped in, \"You like that kind of stuff, Wade?\" Riley looked up at Nick with a warning in her eyes. Shrugging Wade looked in the rear view mirror at Nick, \"Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes.\" Feeling Nick intake a breath, Riley took her queue to talk up, \"I think a wax museum would be cool. To see everything made out of wax and stuff. It takes a lot of patience and skill.\" Riley noticed the thankful look in Wade's eyes. Before another argument could break out, they pulled into a vacant lot and parked the car. Not waiting any longer the three were pushing on the seats to get out of the tinny little car, \"Your car sucks, dude.\" Riley started to get out of the car, but was slowed when Dalton was taking forever to get out. \"Come on Dalton!\" Riley yelled pushing Dalton's back to get him to move faster. \"Paige, Riley, come with me.\" Carly said pushing the two in the direction of the woods. When Carly thought they were out of ear shot from Blake she asked, \"Well?\" \"I couldn't,\" She said shaking her head, \"There's no point in freaking him out right now.\" \"As opposed to when you find out you're pregnant?\" Riley said looking over at Paige. \"Guys, I'm not sure, okay?\" Paige defended looking over at Blake through the trees. Sighing Paige looked from Blake back to the girls in front of her, \"He's been looking forward to this game for months, I don't wanna ruin it by starting a fight.\" Carly rolled her eyes at the blonde, \"Paige, he's not going to marry you.\" Hearing the harsh statement come from Carly's lips, \"His parents won't let him.\" Riley said trying to make what Carly said not so bad. Paige smiled, \"Who says I want to get married? Besides, I've been late before.\" Paige looked at the girls hoping they would just stop talking about it, but seeing the look on their faces she knew they were just going to keep bringing it up until she talked to Blake. Releasing a deep breath she spoke, \"When I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay?\" Seeing the nod from both girls she nodded too. \"Are we done here? Let's get out of these creepy woods.\" Riley said, wrapping her arms around herself while walking back to the boys. Paige and Carly walked back out and laid out on a blanket watching the boys unload everything. Riley walked over to Nick and wrapped her arms around his waist. Feeling warm arms around his waist, Nick turned around and wrapped his arms around her. \"Mhm, what's up babe?\" Nick whispered in her ear. \"You said you were going to be nice in the car.\" Pulling Riley back to look her in the eyes he said, \"No, I said I wasn't going to promise anything.\" \"Well, from now on I want you to promise to stop being a dick to Wade. I want this to be as stressless as it can be.\" \"Fine,\" Nick whispered bring his head down with his lips close to hers, \"If it means that much I will try and be nice.\" Pulling away from Nick's grasp she shook her head, seeing the confused look on Nick's face she smiled, \"You're not going to get a kiss until you prove you'll be nice.\" \"Yeah, don't help us or nothing!\" Dalton yelled looking at Nick who wasn't carrying anything. Nick looked up at Dalton and yelled back, \"Good, I wasn't planning on it!\" Deciding to 'take a load off' Nick walked over and grabbed a chair to sit on, placing it next to the cooler with all the beers in it. Taking the cap off of one beer bottle, he kicked his feet up to relax and watch as the rest of the boys unpacked everything. While Nick did that, Riley walked over to sit with the other girls on the blanket. \"Pass it! Pass it!\" Wade threw his hands up for Blake to throw him the ball. Riley looked up to see that Blake had got the football out to pass the time with. She looked over to see Nick still sitting there by himself, and got up to keep him company. Shoving her hands in her pocket she looked over at Nick, \"Why don't you go pass the football with them?\" Nick looked up just as Riley was standing in front of him, \"You said you wanted me to be nice, I don't want to tempt myself.\" Feeling something hit her leg she looked down to see the football laying there. \"Hey, Riley a little help?\" Laughing she bent over to pick up the ball. \"Don't laugh if it doesn't go far.\" She tried to remember what Nick had thought her about how to throw a football. She placed her fingers in the white stitch and attempted to throw it. When Dalton busted out laughing she knew it hadn't gone as she had planned. The ball had made it to Wade; it just landed a few feet in front of him then rolled the rest of the way. \"Shut the hell up Dalton.\" Riley yelled turning around to sit in the chair next to Nick. \"It's alright babe,\" Nick said getting up, \"It wasn't as bad as it used to be.\" \"Oh gee thanks so much.\" Riley took a deep breath taking in the smell of something dead. She stood up and covered her nose walking over at Nick and shoving her nose in his sweatshirt, \"Oh, my god. What's that smell?\" Nick turned around to look at Dalton, \"Dalton, did you crap your pants again?\" Stuttering Dalton looked around, \"No. I don't know. Maybe,\" He started smelling his work clothes, \"I mean, I'm wearing my work clothes, so…\" \"Something's dead out there.\" Wade said looking out in the woods. Blake shook his head and walked over to the group, \"No, something's dead right here. And we need to drink it back to life!\" He turned toward Nick and held out his hand, \"Bless me, dog!\" Nick threw a beer his way. Riley groaned knowing that because the alcohol is coming out things were bound to pick up. xxxxxxx Riley couldn't believe it. They had dressed Dalton up and he looked completely stupid. The girls couldn't contain their laughter. \"You're coming out.\" Carly said laughing as she stepped out of the tent, with Dalton's camera in her hand. \"I don't know.\" Dalton mumbled backing away from the entrance of the tent. \"If you don't, I will be so mad.\" Shaking his head no, Dalton went to turn around and take everything off. \"Oh, no you don't\" Riley said giving Dalton a push outside. \"Look how good you look!\" Carly said laughing aiming the camera at Dalton. Dalton cowered back a little looking at the guys, nervously waving, \"Hey.\" \"He looks like Elton John, but more gay.\" Blake's comment made Dalton's eyes go wide. \"Elton John is gay?\" Riley laughed and shook her head. \"Only you Dalton.\" Riley started walking over toward the chair beside Nick, but before she passed he pulled her down to sit on his lap. She smiled down at Nick before cuddling into him for his warmth. She turned her head enough to see Dalton had got his camera back and was filming the other two couples make out. When Dalton was done with the other two, he turned the camera toward her and Nick. \"Don't even think about it. I ain't kissing you, dude.\" Nick joked at the look on Dalton's face. \"Come on, you know you want to, dude.\" Dalton joked back. When a sudden bright light brought the young couples out of their comfort zone, Blake straightened up in his seat and yelled, \"Hey, yo, man, you need something?\" \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade said putting his hand in front of his face to try and block the light. Holding Nick closer, Riley whispered, \"Okay, this is getting kind of creepy.\" Blake held his hands up and making a shooing motion, \"Hey, come on, man, get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.\" \"Can we help you?\" Wade said getting up out of his chair. \"Maybe we're on his property.\" Carly whispered standing behind Wade. Wade just shook his head, \"No, we didn't pass a gate.\" Looking back at the truck Blake yelled, \"Hey man, turn off your lights!\" \"Hello!\" Wade yelled Groaning in frustration Blake shouted, \"I'm serious man, turn your lights off, or I'm whopping someone's ass!\" Blake started walking forward, but Wade stopped him, \"It's alright, it's cool, man.\" Riley couldn't get passed what happened next. One minute she was safely in Nick's lap, and the next he had got up, putting her behind him, while he picked up the nearest beer bottle throwing it toward the truck, smashing the front headlight. \"Nick!\" Riley yelled looking up at Nick as he made his way to the front of everyone, glaring at the truck. \"What?\" Dalton yelled from behind Nick, feeling a little brave. The group was waiting for the person in the truck to do something, but instead he just drove away. Watching the truck drive away, Dalton turned to Nick, \"That was great, man!\" Blake walked up and slapped Nick on the back, \"My man Nick here's hardcore!\" Rolling her eyes at Blake, Carly went to go sit back down, \"Don't encourage him.\" Nick rolled his eyes at what Carly said and went to go sit back down himself. Before Riley sat back down she glared at Nick. \"What the hell was that? He could have been a dangerous serial killer who could've hurt us, and you just pissed him off.\" Nick reached out to pull Riley back down on his lap. He wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed her shoulder. \"Don't worry; I wouldn't let that fucker hurt you.\" Smiling she nudged back into Nick's chest enjoying his warmth on the breezy summer night, engulfing the smell she has become used to. xxxxxxx Hearing movement outside the tint, Riley shot up looking around. She glanced down at a sleeping Nick and nudged him. \"Nick,\" She whispered, shaking him slightly. When she got no response she looked over at the other side of the tent and saw Dalton sleeping peacefully. Taking the matters into her own hands, she pushed the covers off and got up to go see what was outside. Stepping outside she walked over toward the fire pit. \"Riley?\" Riley jumped and turned around seeing Carly standing there. \"What are you doing out here?\" Riley said walking over to Carly. \"I thought I heard something,\" She looked around the dark area before looking back at the brunette in front of her, \"You?\" \"I thought I heard something, too.\" \"What are you girls doing out here?\" Both the girls jumped at the deep voice that came from behind them. Turning around to see Wade, Riley released a breath she was holding, \"We thought we heard something. What are you doing?\" Wade reached out to grab Carly, \"Getting you back to bed,\" looking Riley's way he said, \"You should go back to your tent. There's nothing out here.\" Nodding Riley made her way back to her tent. Reaching out to grab the flap of the tent, she stopped when she thought she saw a shadow in the woods. She shook her head thinking it was just an animal and carefully crawled back into the tent next to Nick.[Chapter 2] Chapter two! Enjoy! Reviews would be nice :) Riley woke to the quite morning with the sun shining through the tent holes. She was well relaxed listening to the movement of the trees, until the panicked voice of Blake yelling brought her out of her peace. \"Damn it! Hey, it's 2:30! Get up!\" Riley rolled over on her side and listened to Blake rush around trying to get everyone up. \"Let's go, guys! Get up!\" Riley shut her eyes to try and go back to sleep. When the sound of something hit the tent she knew going back to sleep wasn't an option. \"Wade, Dalton, let's go! We're gonna miss the damn game.\" Groaning Riley rolled over to face Nick, and saw him starting to wake up. \"Nick! Get up!\" \"Good Morning.\" Nick said smiling at Riley. Smiling back she whispered, \"It was until he started yelling.\" Getting up she grabbed some clothes and quickly changed. She looked down at Nick to see him going back to sleep. \"Come on Nick. If you don't get up now he's just going to keep yelling.\" Seeing him sit up, Riley left the tent to see Blake rushing around throwing everything into the back of his truck. Noticing Paige and Carly walk into the woods, Riley followed. \"So, you and Wade talk some more?\" Paige said after everyone was situated. \"We're just in different places right now,\" Carly said looking from Paige to Riley, \"He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying.\" Before anyone said anything else that nasty smell came back, \"Oh, my God, there's that smell again.\" Riley covered her nose and looked at Carly. \"I think it's coming from over there.\" Carly said turning around to follow where the smell would be coming from. Rolling her eyes Riley replied, \"Yeah, let's just follow the smell.\" \"What?\" Carly shrugged, \"I wanna see what it is.\" \"Why? This is disgusting.\" Riley said following close behind with Paige behind her. \"Come on.\" \"I seriously think I'm going to throw up.\" Riley gagged while Paige covered her nose in disgust. \"Oh, my God,\" Paige said as the smell got worse, \"I hate you!\" Laughing Carly turned around to look at the two girls behind her, but before she could say anything she fell down a hill. \"Carly!\" Riley yelled running forward to see if Carly was alright. \"Carly!\" Paige ran up behind Riley and tried looking through the trees to spot her friend. \"Paige! Riley!\" \"Are you okay?\" Paige yelled. While Paige tried to get answers from Carly, Riley started yelling for the boys to help. \"Guys, help us! Nick!\" \"I'm stuck!\" \"Hold on Carly! We're gonna get you out of there!\" Paige yelled \"Wade! Please help me get out of here!\" With each word Carly was growing more and more urgent to get out. Seeing the boys running toward them, Riley yelled for them again, \"Guys! Get down here!\" Wade ran past Riley and slid down the hill to get to Carly. Paige walked over to Blake and cuddled up to him as if she was the one that fell down the hill. Riley kept looking down the hill to see if Wade got Carly out of the pile of filth, that it took her a minute to realize Nick had come up behind her and wrapped his arms around her shoulders. \"You alright, baby?\" He whispered in her ear. Smiling she answered him, \"Well, I'm not the one face first in a big pile of nasty road kill. So, I'm pretty good.\" Noticing a truck pull up to the pile, they all turned around to look at the truck. \"Hey, is that the truck from last night?\" Blake said stepping forward. \"Not unless he fixed his headlight.\" Panic went through Riley as the thoughts of that actually being the truck set in. Nick noticed the panic in Riley's face, so he pulled her closer to his body. The truck stopped and a dirty man got out of the car. He went to the back of his truck and began throwing dead animals into the pile, acting as if he didn't even notice the group standing on the other side of the pile. \"Hey!\" Wade called out getting the attention from the dirty man. \"Don't you see that?\" Carly said pointing to the hand sticking out from the pile. He looked toward where Carly was pointing and started walking toward it. \"Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick.\" Riley whispered to Nick while walking behind him to wrap her arms around his waist, and sticking her nose in his shirt. \"No way,\" Wade said. Getting the best of Riley, she looked up to see what the man was doing. \"What are you doing, man?\" Reaching the hand, he stopped and looked at it. He bent over and grabbed the hand, when he had a firm grasp on the hand he started pulling it. A couple of pulls later the hand popped out of the pile. \"Anyone need a hand?\" He said holding up the hand for everyone to see. \"I'm just fooling. It's not real, see?\" He said knocking on the hand to prove it was fake. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" Riley said moving from behind Nick to stand beside him. \"God.\" Carly said, rolling her eyes and walking over to where Blake and Paige were. Riley began walking over to see if Carly was okay, before she was stopped by Nick's hand on her arm. \"I'm fine.\" She said, and continuing to walk to Carly. \"I found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago,\" The man said. \"What are you guys doing here?\" \"Oh, my God, are you okay?\" Riley said ignoring the nasty man to see how her friend was. While Wade told the man about our situation, Paige dug through her purse to see if she had any water to wash off some of the filth on Carly. \"Hey, is there a gas station around here?\" Wade asked. \"Well, I got some gas in the truck if..\" The man said pointing to the back of his pickup truck, but before he could continue Wade cut him off. \"I need a fan belt.\" \"What?\" Carly said looking over at Wade. \"Just busted.\" He shrugged looking over at Carly, then back to the man. Rolling her eyes she went back to washing herself off, \"Of course. Perfect.\" \"Bo might have one, runs a station in Ambrose.\" The man said looking at the group of kids. \"Where's that?\" \"Fifteen miles up the road.\" \"Let's just get one in Baton Rouge.\" Blake said cutting in wanting to get to the game. \"Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car.\" Wade shot back looking over at Blake. \"What if that guy from last night strips it?\" \"You're gonna miss the game, then.\" Blake said rolling his eyes. \"Yeah,\" He said looking over at Carly. \"Well, that's not why I came.\" \"All right, look.\" Blake said hoping he could just get the damn fan belt and get to the game. \"I'll run you up to the station. Kickoff's in a couple of hours.\" Shaking his head Wade began to argue, \"You're already late. You gotta snag tickets. Y'all should go now. I'll stay with my car, it's fine. Just get me a fan belt on the way back, and make sure it's a 15 inch.\" Nodding his head, Blake said \"Gotcha.\" \"I'll give you a ride.\" The man spoke up looking at Wade. \"You serious?\" Wade asked in disbelief. Shrugging he nodded, \"If you like.\" \"Well, yeah, yeah.\" He nodded and began going down the hill. \"I'm going with you.\" Carly spoke up and began walking toward Wade. \"Carly, no.\" Paige said. \"Yes. It'll be fine.\" She said shrugging her off. \"Alright, let's go.\" Blake said pulling Paige up the hill and back to the camp. \"Carly.\" Nick said walking down the hill. \"What?\" She said looking at Nick. He took his shirt off and handed it to Carly to take. Riley couldn't help herself but stare at Nick's body. Even at the most inappropriate times, she couldn't help but admire her boyfriend's amazing body. \"Thank you.\" Hearing Carly talk brought Riley back to reality, she looked away trying to gain her composure again. Seeing the nasty man stare at Carly, Riley walked in front of her to try and block the view from him. Wade, Dalton, and Nick stood in front of her too, but with that creepy look on his face Riley knew he saw everything. Eh, gross. \"Come on, baby. Let's get out of here.\" Wade said grabbing Carly's hand once she was done putting Nick's shirt on. \"Be careful.\" Riley said looking at her best friend and her boyfriend get into the car with a dirty little man. Riley turned around and walked up the hill behind Nick and Dalton. \"Man, you're just gonna let them leave like that?\" Dalton said turning around to look at the truck driving away. \"With a guy who throws roadkill in a pit for a living?\" Laughing Nick just shook his head, \"You clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic-Tank-Man. What's the difference?\" \"Well, I don't walk through it, that's one.\" \"Babe, what if that was the guy from last night, only in a different truck.\" Riley said looking back toward the truck, but only seeing a dusty road. Nick turned to glance at Riley. \"Don't worry. Carly can protect herself.\" Riley could only nod, because she still had that gut feeling that something just wasn't right about that guy, and not just because he looked and smelled like shit. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Dude, it's over.\" Nick said looking out the window of miles and miles of traffic ahead of them. \"It'll move!\" Blake yelled from the front. \"Well, it's not moving. It's been like this for a good hour now.\" Riley said \"We can still make the second half.\" Blake said hoping that the traffic would move, but to no avail. \"I'm not sitting in this.\" Paige said looking out the window. \"What do you want me to do?\" Blake yelled looking over at Paige. \"We have to go back.\" Nick said in the 'duh' voice. \"I'm not missing this game!\" Even though Blake was holding his ground, he knew that he just wasn't going to win this one. Turning around to see everyone staring at him, he knew that he had to turn around. \"Fine.\" Blake mumbled turning the car around and heading back to the camp site. Paige pulled out her phone to call Carly and tell her the news. \"Hey, it's me. We're heading back.\" Riley just wanted to hurry up and get out of this car. It was hot and she was starting to get really claustrophobic. \"Traffic. Did you get that fan belt thing or whatever?\" Paige asked looking down at her nails. \"So, where do you want us to pick you up?\" \"Cool, see you then.\" Paige hung up and looked at Blake. \"They said they didn't get the fan belt, and we need to pick them up.\" \"How are we going to get the stupid fan belt thing?\" Riley asked No one answered her, they only shrugged and nodded. The ride back to the camp site was really quite and awkward. Riley laid her head on Nick shoulder and watched all the trees pass by the car window. Before she knew it, they were pulling into the campsite once more. Nick and Dalton walked over to the trees, and Riley and Paige stayed in the car. \"Hey, Paige,\" Paige looked up to see Blake looking at her from by the trees. \"Yeah?\" \"Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them.\" Blake said walking toward the truck. \"Why? We can go.\" \"Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving.\" Blake whined, while Riley rolled her eyes. \"Paige don't argue with him. You might have to make him feel better after he had to give up the 'biggest game of the year'.\" Riley said exaggerating just a bit. Paige looked from Riley to her whining boyfriend, \"Okay.\" Riley was not about to stay here and listen to the two of them go at it, so she got out of the back of the truck and walked over to Nick. Blake walked over and stood in front of Nick, \"Why don't you let my man drive?\" He looked over at Dalton and threw the keys his way. \"Really?\" Dalton asked in disbelief. When Blake was out of sight, Nick grabbed Dalton's jacket, \"Give me the damn keys.\" \"Okay. Very slow. Thank you.\" Dalton slowly dropped the keys in Nick's hand. While Nick walked over to the driver's side, Dalton walked to the passenger side. \"Whoa, big boy, to the back seat for you.\" Riley said holding up her hand to stop Dalton in his tracks. After she sent him to the back she opened the passenger side door and hopped in. \"Just let me drive, bitch. He gave me the keys, man.\" Dalton complained from the back. \"Yeah, because he thinks I'm the one who stole the car,\" Nick said looked at him. \"And crashed it.\" Riley mumbled. \"Whatever. You didn't have to cover for me, dude.\" \"Your jacket's clean, all right? Mine's already got plenty of stains on it.\" Riley reached over and grabbed Nick's hand. She knew all about the incident between Nick and Dalton, and she felt bad for Nick. Riley reached up and grabbed the GPS. \"Where the hell is this place? The town isn't even on the GPS.\" \"It's got to be on there.\" Nick said looking from the road to the GPS. \"Well, it's bound to be up here. He said it was about 15 miles up.\" Dalton said leaning up in the front seat to look straight ahead. \"So,\" Dalton looked at Nick, \"you think Carly and Wade are gonna stay together when she moves to New York. Because she be looking at me sometimes like,\" \"Dalton, it ain't happening.\" Nick said laughing. \"What? What do you mean?\" \"And even if it was happening,\" Riley said laughing turning around to look at the look on Dalton's face. \"It ain't happening. Nothing personal.\" Nick finished. \"Why? You like me better than Wade, right?\" Dalton asked still in shock. Nick looked at Riley, \"Wade's not so bad.\" Riley smiled at his answer. She knew that Nick liked Wade, he was just putting up that stupid 'bad boy' act. Although she thought it was incredibly sexy, it could be a big pain in the ass sometimes. \"Yeah, I like Wade too.\" Dalton said leaning back in his seat. Feeling the car come to a stop Riley looked up to see a washed out road. \"Is this it?\" Riley asked looking over at Nick. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, should we drive through it?\" Riley asked, \"I mean it is a big truck.\" \"Through all that?\" \"It was just a suggestion.\" Riley said getting out of the car. \"I don't know. I could do it.\" Dalton said looking at the road then shaking his head. \"That's what I thought.\" Nick said, grabbing Riley's hand to walk through that washed out road. Walking around a creepy abandoned down when it was dark out was not the ideal night for Riley. But, it made her worry when she realized that Wade and Carly were out in this too. \"Hello?\" Dalton looked around the town, \"Carly? Wade? Hello?\" Dalton yelled even louder as we approached an empty gas station with loud music playing. \"Man, there's music playing, but I don't think anyone's here.\" \"There has to be someone here. Who just leaves music playing?\" Riley said feeling the cold night breeze. Sticking her and Nick's intertwined hands into his jacket pocket, loving the instant heat. See that yelling at an empty gas station wasn't getting them anywhere, Nick began walking in the opposite direction dragging Riley along. \"Where are you going?\" Dalton asked. \"To that grocery store we passed, I'm thirsty.\" \"What about Carly and Wade?\" Riley said turning around to look back at Dalton and the gas station. \"Maybe they're at the store.\" Nick gave Riley's hand a little squeeze to try and reassure her. \"What?\" He said seeing that Riley didn't like the answer he just gave her. \"I don't know, man. We came all this way. You don't think we should look for them?\" Nick stopped to look at Dalton again. \"Check it. Me and Riley are going this way, you go that way. If we don't find them, meet back here, and we'll go back to the road.\" He finished looking at Riley, \"Cool?\" \"Okay.\" Dalton said walking in the opposite direction Nick and Riley were going. Riley walked closer to Nick as they walked into the little store. \"Yo, paying customer.\" Nick yelled in the store, hoping to get a response. Nick let go Riley's hand to walk to the front of the store as she walked to an isle nearby. \"Hello?\" \"This place is disgusting.\" Riley said holding up a moldy box. \"Babe, can we get out of here? Maybe Dalton is looking for us.\" Nick turned around and began walking toward where Riley was. He stood so close to her that she could feel his breath hitting her cheek. \"Why don't we just ditch this place,\" Nick raised his hand to graze her cheek. In an instant their lips crashed on to one another's, loving the feel of each other. Riley ran her hands all over his rock hard chest. Pulling back, Riley put her forehead on his, \"Babe, as much as I would love that, I really just wanna find Wade and Carly, and just get the hell home.\" She looked over and saw that someone was coming out of the gas station they were just at. \"Nick, look someone's at the gas station.\" Turning around he noticed the man too. He grabbed Riley's hand and rushed out of the store walking the short distance to the gas station. \"Hey,\" Nick called out getting the attention of the man, \"I'm looking for my sister and her boyfriend.\" \"Yeah, they were looking for a fan belt or something.\" Shaking his head he walked forward a little bit, \"I don't think I've seen them.\" Riley felt eyes on her as she stepped closer to Nick, not liking the way this man was acting. \"This is the only gas station in town, right?\" Nick asked not believing a word this man is saying. \"That's right.\" The man agreed. \"Yeah, then they were definitely here.\" Getting aggravated the man stepped forward, \"I just told you, I didn't see them.\" \"Well, does someone else work here?\" Riley asked. \"No, I own the station. And I would have seen them.\" He said looking from Nick over to Riley. Riley couldn't help but shift her weight to lean more on to Nick. She just didn't like the way this man kept looking at her. \"Well, we were just here a few minutes ago, and you didn't see us.\" Nick pointed out, \"You weren't even here.\" \"Sorry. Can't help you.\" Right after the last word came out of his mouth, Riley could hear what sounded like a muffled voice. She looked over at Nick to see if he had heard what she heard, he did. \"What was that?\" \"Nothing. That was just my dog.\" The man shrugged. \"Actually, you know what? My brother Vincent was down here for a while. He could've helped your sister out. They could be up at the house.\" The man said pointing toward the direction Dalton had just gone. Nick turned around to see what the man was pointing at. \"No, my friend went that way earlier.\" \"Really?\" He asked looking down at his shoe, after a slight pause he turned around to tie his shoe, \"Well, maybe he ran into my brother up there, then.\" He said standing up straight. Riley couldn't help but notice just how tall and scary this man looked. \"Wanna head up to the house?\" The man said pointing to the hill. When no one started talking Riley could faintly hear that muffled voice, only it sounded like it was in pain. Like a wounded animal that was just shot, or hit by a car. \"Yeah, whatever.\" Nick said pulling Riley on the other side that the man wasn't on. She couldn't be happier that Nick picked up on his creepiness, because Riley didn't feel safe at all with him next to her. \"So, what's your sister look like anyway?\" The man asked glancing over at Nick. \"Nick! Riley! Help me!\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3! Enjoy! Reviews are always nice! \"Nick! Riley! Help me!\" They all turned around at the sound of Carly scream. Nick pushed Riley back before the man's fist came into contact with her. Riley ran toward the gas station as Nick threw a punch at the man. Riley ran into the station and turned around just in time to see Nick right behind her. \"Close the door!\" Nick yelled. Riley closed and locked the door. She looked up the see the man standing on the other side looking at her, before he ran to the garage door on the other side. Riley turned around to see Nick take off in the direction the man just ran. Riley wasted no time in looking around the shop for her friend. \"Carly?\" Riley yelled. \"Please help me! Riley, I'm down here!\" Riley went to the back of the gas station to discover a downward set of stairs. Riley walked down the stairs and stopped at the door. She reached out and tried to turn the knob. Riley used both hands to try and turn it, when she didn't get the door to budge she yelled out, \"Nick! She's down here! The door won't open!\" Nick came running to the sound of Riley's voice. \"Okay, watch out.\" Riley moved out of the way so Nick could open the door. It seemed that without effort Nick kicked the door open in no time. \"Carly!\" Riley walked through the room and saw Carly tied to a chair with blood all over the place. \"Thank God.\" Carly breathed and rested her head on the back of the chair. \"Oh, my gosh.\" Riley said noticing the smear of blood on her lips. \"Okay. I'm here. I've got you.\" Nick said walking over to remove all the tape so she could get out of the chair. \"Watch my finger. Watch my finger.\" Carly said wincing in pain. Riley gasped as she looked down at Carly's finger and noticed that a chunk was missing. Hearing Riley's gasp, Nick looked down to see what she was looking at. \"Did he do this to you?\" Nick said grabbing Carly's hand. He ripped off a piece of her shirt and wrapped it around her finger trying to stop the blood as much as possible. \"Where is he?\" Nick didn't answer her question; instead he was looking around the room. When Nick didn't answer Carly asked again, \"Where is he?\" \"I locked him out.\" Nick said walking over with a blade in his hand to free Carly's legs. \"Wait, where's Wade at?\" Riley said not seeing Wade in sight. Looking over at Riley, Carly shook her head, \"I don't know. He went into the house. This place is a freak show!\" She said getting up and out of the chair. \"Come on let's just find everyone and get the hell out of here.\" Riley said with panic in her voice. The sound of a car turning on made the three stop dead in their tracks. The three waited until the sound of the car was in the distance and they could faintly hear it. \"He's gone, let's go.\" Nick said looking at Riley and Carly. Nick led the way back up the stairs and signal to stop at the top. \"Alright, stay here.\" Riley and Carly stopped and waited for Nick. He ran over to the garage door and looked left and right. Nick went to walk away, only he stopped once he saw tools. He walked over and grabbed a wrench before coming back to the stairs. \"Alright, the car's by the road,\" Seeing Riley shake her head he stopped and raised his eyebrows. \"How are we going to get in the car?\" Riley remembered. \"Damn it, Dalton's got the keys,\" Nick finally remembered and looked around the room for anything to help them. \"Dalton.\" Nick paused and thought for a second. \"We gotta call the cops.\" He ran over to the phone hanging on the wall. He picked it up and hanging it right back up, \"Shit! The phone's dead.\" Nick walked back over and stood in front of Carly, putting his hands on both her arms he looked her in the eyes, \"Hey, where's your cell phone?\" \"It might be in the truck up near the house,\" Nick walked over to the front of the store and looked out the window. \"What about Wade? I think he had him too.\" Nick looked up the hill toward the house in question. Riley walked up the rest of the stairs and looked out the window herself. \"What if he turns him to wax?\" Riley paled at what Carly just said. She turned around to make sure she heard Carly right. Nick had also turned around at what Carly said. \"What do you mean, wax?\" \"You two don't get it. They're all wax, everyone.\" She saw the disbelieving looks of the two and remembered the woman she had saw earlier that day. \"No, wait.\" Carly walked to the door and looked around to make sure no one was out there, before opening the door and walking down the street. Riley grabbed Nick's hand and followed Carly. \"There was a woman in here. She was alive. She pulled back the curtain.\" Nick jumped over the fence and walked up to the window. Riley just simply opened the gate and followed Carly into the yard. Nick found a brick to stand on and help Riley up before stepping on it herself. Riley could see the lights on in the house, she squinted her eyes to try and get a better look inside. Riley and Nick weren't prepared for what was about to happen next, the curtain pulled back revealing an elderly woman looking out the window. Riley gasped and fell off of the brick. She hadn't noticed Nick jump off the brick until she felt his arms around her to keep her from falling on her ass. \"You okay?\" He asked Riley when she stood up straight. Riley was still trying to get her heart rate under control and just nodded her head to tell him she was fine. \"The whole town is rigged.\" Carly said, once she stepped on the board and looking in the window herself. \"That's impossible.\" Riley whispered looking back at the window, seeing the curtain pull back once again. \"You're saying that that's a real person,\" Nick looked over at Carly, \"underneath?\" \"Yes. At the church, they were all like that. At least 20 more.\" \"Okay, this is really freaking me out. Can we just get everyone and get the fuck out!\" Riley couldn't take much more. Learning that people were under the wax made her just want to forget everyone and just run to safety. \"Come on, babe.\" Nick grabbed Riley around the waste and pulled her into a hug. He held her in his embrace until he knew she had calmed down. \"Everything is going to be alright.\" He said pulling her back and kissing her on the lips. Nick grabbed Riley's hand and led the group out on to the streets. \"Why are we walking in plain sight. I mean for all we know he could be watching us right now and we don't even know it.\" Nick turned around to look at Riley. \"Yeah.\" Nick spotted a store with a manikin holding a gun. Riley knew what Nick was thinking and she didn't like it. \"Wait!\" Riley grabbed a hold of his arm to stop him from throwing what he had in his hand at the window. \"Nick, what are you doing?\" You have to be careful.\" \"I am being careful.\" He said grabbing Riley's hand and putting it down at her side. Riley hated this Nick, his stubborn side. \"No, no, no! It'll make too much noise.\" Nick turned to look at Carly, \"Why do you have to be so damn stubborn? He will find us.\" Carly said crossing her arms in front of her chest. Riley walked over to the side and waited until Nick was done 'being a man.' \"Yeah, chances are he will anyway,\" Riley just loved Nick's positive attitude. He threw whatever was in his hand at the window, shattering it to millions of pieces. He got up on the stand and took the gun from the manikin. \"At least with this, he might not wanna find us.\" \"That's about right.\" Nick said looking at the gun, before he got down. He eyed the manikin and hurt consumed his eyes. Riley just couldn't believe that there was an actual person underneath and it pained her to know that looking at this man, he would be trapped here forever. Without warning a shot broke the glass door and shattered it. Riley ducked and saw the man standing there with a gun in his hand. \"Go, Riley, Carly! Run!\" Without hesitation Carly and Riley took off running into the nearest building, the theater. \"Go hide.\" Nick whispered. Carly ran to the back row and sat down; Riley scanned the room before sitting toward the front. She sat there for a few seconds trying to get her breathing under control. She jumped a little when the movie started playing on the screen and she heard the door open. Riley knew to stay still and be quite. She caught her breath when she felt the man's presence right beside her. He walked to the front of the room and looked at all the wax figures. \"I know you're in here.\" He started to count the people in the row. When the man's eyes landed on Riley she tried to remain still. The man smiled and raised his gun. \"Nick!\" Riley yelled and ducked, noticing Nick come out from the back of the room. Nick shot the guy in his arm. Riley shot up and ran toward Nick, Carly hot on her heels. There was a gunshot from the man, but missed the group. \"Hide behind the counter.\" Carly and Riley nodded and ducked behind the counter, while Nick stood a few feet from the door and aimed the gun. It was a few seconds before the guy came through the door. He smiled upon seeing Nick right in front of him. Nick shot the man in his chest, making him fall back on the ground. Riley looked up and saw the man lying motionless on the floor. She walked out and stood above the man. Nick bent over and picked up his gun. \"Empty shells. Check him for ammo.\" Carly bent over and searched the guy. Riley walked over to Nick and squeezed his arm. Nick saw the fear in her eyes. \"Babe, it's gonna be alright.\" \"Can we just get out of here?\" \"Give me this.\" Carly said getting up and grabbing the gun from Nick's hands. She threw it behind the counter and looked back, \"Nick, Riley, let's get out of here.\" Carly was the one to lead the group this time. Nick grabbed Riley's hand and led them both in the shadows of the houses to try and avoid another run in. \"Is there anybody left alive in this town?\" Riley asked walking up the hill. \"What about this Vincent guy?\" Carly asked. \"Who knows if there even is a Vincent,\" Riley started to get more and more frustrated the more they found out they were pretty much stuck in this town. Nick turned and looked at Carly, \"You said your cell phone is in the truck?\" Carly leaned against a big piece of machinery and Nick turned to look at her. \"Yeah.\" She said no knowing where he's getting at. \"Alright this is what we're gonna do,\" Riley couldn't help but notice Nick being all sexy and serious. \"I'm gonna go to the truck and get your cell phone, and see if I can get help. I want you two to go back to the road. Paige and Blake..\" \"No way, Nick. No.\" Riley said not wanting to leave Nick alone by himself. \"Nick, you can't leave us alone.\" \"Why do you have to be so,\" Carly raised her eyebrows at Nick repeating what she said earlier. \"damn stubborn.\" Nick glanced back up at the house, \"Okay. We stick together; nothing's gonna happen to us.\" \"Come on.\" Nick said walking up toward the house. \"It's under the front seat.\" Carly whispered upon nearing the truck. Riley looked up and noticed the back end of the truck hanging off into a ditch. \"Nice parking job.\" Riley couldn't help but comment on the appearance of the truck. Nick walked up to the truck and opening the front door. Carly climbed in the truck to search around for her phone. \"It's not in there.\" \"What about Wade and Dalton?\" Riley said. \"Wade went in there,\" Carly said pointing to the house, \"and never came out.\" \"Alright,\" Nick spoke up. \"We'll go in quick, one pass. If we can't find them, we have to get the hell out of here.\" Nick nodded his head as if asking if there were any arguments with the plan. \"Yeah.\" Riley and Carly said in unison. \"Come on, let's try the back.\" Nick, Carly, and Riley crouched down in the high grass to avoid being seen. Once they reached the back door Nick took charge and opened the door. Carly noticed a bat laying up against the wall and walked over to pick it up. \"Stay close.\" Nick whispered. \"Yeah, way ahead of you.\" Riley said scooting in closer to Nick. Nick walked in and held his hand up before Riley and Carly could step inside. He peeked in to see if anyone was inside. He turned back around and nodded. Once they stepped in Carly noticed a phone on the kitchen counter. Hearing the dead end on the line she put it back down. Riley followed Nick into the living room. Nick went to look at the stairs, while Riley looked around all the papers laying around the floor. \"Dalton?\" \"Wade?\" \"Nick,\" Carly whispered. \"Nick, there's guns.\" Riley looked up from the piles of paper when she heard glass braking. She saw Nick breaking the cabinet glass in order to get the guns. \"It's bolted to the wall.\" Riley knew it was too good to be true. \"There's got to be a key around her somewhere.\" Riley put the papers down and began looking for a key. She walked over to a dresser and opened the top drawer filled with newspaper clippings. She picked up an article with the title \"Siamese Twins Separated.\" Riley put down the paper and notice pictures with two little boys, one with some form of a mask on his face. She was holding a picture of the twins when Bo barged through the front door. She dropped the picture and Carly headed in a different direction. Riley hid in the nearest place she could find. She looked up and found Nick standing behind the fridge in the kitchen. Riley rolled under the pool table. She noticed Bo stumbling into the kitchen with the bows sticking out of his body. Riley turned away when Bo started pulling the arrow out of his arm. She could handle a lot of things, but that was not one of them. Riley looked up just in time to see Bo throw up in the sink, that was just her luck. She turned around before she threw up at the sight in the kitchen. She noticed car lights shine through the window, and crouched down even lower in the fear she was going to be seen. Riley looked out the window and saw Blake and Paige's dead body in the back of the truck. She covered her mouth trying to hold back her tears. Turing away from the back of the truck she caught another man getting out of the front seat. She pulled back from the window and pushed herself back until her back made contact with the pool table. She heard footsteps approaching. Trying her best to stay quite she rolled under the table. \"Hey, you don't ever leave here without me. You know better than that. Don't be so stupid. What's the matter with you?\" Bo yelled out the door. Bo walked into the kitchen followed by the other man with longer black hair. \"Don't!\" The man reached in and started touching the arrow in his chest. \"I said, don't! Get.\" Riley felt pain for the other man, Bo was practically treating his like a worthless dog. Riley couldn't believe she was even thinking that. Her she is, basically trapped in the house with these crazy people that just killed her friends, and she's feeling sorry for one of them. Okay, she was going to need some serious therapy if she made it out of this hell hole alive. The man lit a candle, and grabbed a spoon. He stuck the spoon in the fire and looked in something when he began fixing his mask. Wait, Riley got a closer look and realized he had wax on his face! \"Hey, the town's looking real good. We almost finished what mama started. Those two are good. They'll fit perfectly.\" Those two? Riley's eyes widened in realization that Blake and Paige are going to be made of wax and are going to be trapped here forever! Okay, she had to find Nick and Carly and get the hell out of here. Nick. She didn't know where Nick was and she got more and more worried when the thought of him being gone hit her. \"She always said that you talent would make up for what God took away from you.\" Riley heard the last sentence, but didn't quite understand it. What was taken away from him? While they were talking in the kitchen, Riley got up and walked to the nearest hallway trying not to make any noise. She turned around when footsteps were walking to where she had just came from. She saw Bo bend down and pick up the picture she had dropped. Before she could get caught, she walked up the flight of stairs that were down the hall way. She made it to the top of the stairs when a hand clamped over her mouth. \"Shh.\" She instantly calmed down when Nick's voice came from behind her. She turned around and wrapped her arms around his waist. She was so happy to see Nick, and this time she wasn't about to let him out of her sight. \"It's okay, it's okay.\" He wrapped his arms around her shoulders and just held her there. After a moment, he led her into another room. Riley breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Carly standing there. \"I saw Paige and Blake's bodies. They're dead.\" Nick stopped on the stair when he heard that. Nick had found a trap door with stairs that led into the ground. This was just getting better and better as the night went on. \"We gotta go. Now.\" Riley followed Nick down the stairs. It led down to a path way, with dirt floors and wood walls. Riley could barely hear herself breathe over the sound of what sounded like a big machine. \"Damn.\" Riley looked back at Carly as she held her hands on her ears to try and block out the sound. \"I can't see anything.\" Nick said as they approached the end of the hallway with no lights on. \"There's gotta be a light here somewhere.\" Riley said noticing all the switches on the wall. Nick walked over and started messing with all of them, in the hopes it would turn on some light for them to see. Carly noticed more switches and began switching those. After switching almost all of them, Nick finally found the one that turned on the path's lights, and they continued to walk the rest of the way. They came to a stop again when they noticed a big boiler room. Nick walked over to a table that had Dalton's hat. \"Dalton.\" Riley tried to hold back the tears when she saw what she assumed to be Dalton sitting in a chair covered in wax. Riley saw Nick walk over to Dalton. She walked over behind Nick and saw the pain in his eyes. \"I'll get you out of there.\" He grabbed on to the device that was attached to his head. He started to pull on it, but when he pulled to hard his head snapped right off. \"No!\" Carly cover her mouth when she began to cry. Nick turned around with wide eyes. \"No. Nick,\" Riley couldn't help herself. She started to cry when she knew that it was just them three left. Their best friends were gone. Carly started to pull on Nick when she began crying harder. Nick turned around to embrace his sister. Riley wrapped her arms around herself and turned around, not wanting to look at Dalton this way. Riley sobered up the moment the man with long hair came running into the room pulling out knifes from his waist. \"That's Vincent!\" Carly yelled.[Chapter 4] Here's the last chapter. I hope everyone enjoyed this story! Thanks to all that have reviewed and added this story to their favorite list! \"That's Vincent!\" Carly yelled. Riley ran over to Carly, as Nick ran forward to push over a table to stop Vincent from entering the room. The table pushed Vincent against the wall, but he bounced back quickly. Before Nick could make his next move Vincent cut him in the back with one of the knifes. With Nick out of the way Vincent turned his attention to Carly and Riley. Carly remembered the bat in her hand and swung the bat at Vincent. Standing there defenseless, Riley could only go over to Nick to see if he was alright. \"Come on, Nick!\" Riley said pushing Nick up to his feet. Riley saw Carly lying on the ground, with fire flaming around her. Nick jumped up and pushed Vincent up against the wall. After struggling against Vincent and his knifes, Nick flipped Vincent to the ground and rushed over to Carly lying on the ground. \"Come on, Carly! Move it!\" Riley ran over to the big boiling pan Carly was beside and waited for Nick and Carly to get out of the way. \"Come on, Riley!\" Seeing Vincent get back up Nick tried pushing Riley to get out, but Riley stood there looking at the pan. \"Nick, pull on this!\" Nick stepped in front of Riley and pulled down on the chain by the bowl. The pan began spilling out hot wax on the floor. It caught flames in the vents on the floor and stopped Vincent in his tracks. Riley took off in the direction where Carly was standing near the door way. She stopped and looked back at Nick when she realized he wasn't behind her. \"Nick, let's get out of here!\" Nick turned toward the sound of Riley's voice. With one last glance at Vincent behind the flames he ran toward the girls. Without hesitation the group ran out of the door, down the path way, and up a set of stairs that had wax faces in the wall. Disgust over came Riley just looking at the faces. \"Come on! Come this way!\" Nick ran up behind them and led them into a house, but not the house they had just came from. Running through the kitchen she saw that everything was wax. They were in the wax house. Before leaving the kitchen, she noticed a set of high chairs with the names Bo and Vincent on the back of the chairs. On the arm rail of Bo's there were straps, but not on Vincent's. Without putting thought into it she kept with the group. She ran into Nick's back and looked the way he was looking. \"No. Oh, my God. Wade.\" Riley's heart broke when she saw Wade sitting on the piano bench, with half his jaw missing. Riley turned over and hugged Carly, not knowing the pain she would be feeling, but knowing enough that it wasn't an easy thing. Nick looked over and remembered the psychopath chasing them. He grabbed onto Riley's arm to pull the two into the other room. \"Come on.\" \"No.\" Carly started to protest. \"Come on, honey.\" Riley pulled on her arm. Nick opened the sliding door that lead to the other room, but stopped once he was inside. Riley looked up to see Bo standing in front of them. \"You sick fuck!\" Nick yelled. He pushed Riley and Carly back, then ran after Bo pushing them both to the ground. They got up and Bo started punching Nick. Bo pushed Nick back into the chair. Carly gripped the bat tight, and walked over to Bo swinging the bat at his back. Bo didn't seem to flinch, and punched Carly in the face sending her tumbling to the ground. Riley walked over and picked up the bat. Nick jumped up from behind the couch and started punching Bo. Riley went to move forward but started slipping. She looked down and saw that the floor was melting and flames appeared from a spot in the floor. \"You're finished.\" Riley looked up right when Nick got stabbed in the leg, and panic rippled through her body. Bo got up and started stumbling toward Nick, who was laying on the ground. Without thinking twice Riley slid her way over to Bo and swung the bat. The bat landed right on his face, sending him backward. Riley couldn't help what happened next. She just kept swinging that bat on his face. She could only thing of all the innocent people he murdered; her friends that he killed. She just kept swinging. His face was getting more bloody and disfigured the more she swung. \"Riley, behind you!\" Riley snapped out of her thoughts and turned to see Vincent stumbling into the room. Carly rushed over to Riley and pulled her away from the dead body on the floor. Vincent walked over to Bo and knelt down beside him. \"Come on!\" Riley tried to push Nick up, but he just looked over at Vincent. \"Run! Go, Riley! Carly run!\" Riley turned to see Vincent in hot pursuit of her. Carly took off toward the stairs and Riley followed behind her. The two didn't look back, they just kept running. \"Hey, Vincent,\" Nick struggled to get up. \"Hey!\" When Vincent didn't slow down Nick yelled some more, \"I swear to God, if you hurt them,\" \"Vincent!\" Riley and Carly paused for a moment to think of their next move. Riley turned and noticed another flight of stairs. She pushed Carly in that direction. On the top of the stairs was a door. Riley pushed the door open to reveal a large bed in the middle of the room. To the right of her was a crib with two babies inside, connected at the head, just like the picture she had found in the house. Then it finally hit her. Bo and Vincent were the twins in the picture, and that's why Vincent wore the wax on his face. \"Riley push the crib in front of the door.\" Carly closed the door and pointed to the crib in the corner that Riley had been looking at. Riley slid over to the other side of the crib and pushed it in front of the door. When she was in front of the door a knife cut through the door making her jump back from shock. The knife began sliding down the door and when it reached the babies in the crib it cut through their heads in a way that resembled the way Vincent and Bo would've been separated. Riley and Carly backed up against the wall when Vincent ripped through the door and threw the crib out of the way. With no other option, Riley could only think of one way to stop Vincent from getting any closer. \"No. Listen to me. Listen to me!\" Riley held up her hand, \"I heard you talking. You don't need to do this. You didn't have to listen to your brother. I saw Bo's scars, and the highchairs.\" \"No!\" Vincent took a swing at Riley with the knife, but Carly and Riley ran across the bed before he could make contact. Carly ran out of the room and left Riley there to defend herself. Great. \"You're not a freak! He was!\" Okay this talking thing was getting her somewhere. If she kept this up maybe she could just run for it. \"You don't need to do this! Please! You're an artist. Bo was lying to you. He used you. Do you really think that your mother would have wanted you to do this?\" Then Riley said the stupidest thing she could've said. \"Please, don't kill me!\" She took off running with Vincent right behind her. \"Motherfucker!\" Nick came running into the room to tackle Vincent. Riley ran down the hall but stopped when she heard Nick yell her name. \"I'm here.\" Riley said stumbling into the room to see Vincent on top of Nick with a knife an inch from his face. Nick looked down at the knife in his leg telling Riley to pull it out. Riley used both hands to pull the knife from him leg, only wincing when Nick let out a scream. Riley was stunned when Vincent looked up at her. She froze at the sight she saw. He was missing half of his face. Nick reached up and grabbed his arm before the knife could hit Riley. \"Riley, do it! Do it now!\" Nick held Vincent's arm above his head, signaling for her to stab him. Oh yeah. Riley was going to need some serious therapy after this. Riley stepped forward and drove the knife right into Vincent's stomach. Nick took the opportunity to kick Vincent off the bed. When Vincent hit the floor, he went straight through it. Then the floor below them collapsed as well. Knowing the floor below them could collapse at any time too; Riley crawled over to Nick and pushed him to get up. \"Nick, get up!\" \"How do we get out?\" Riley and Nick looked over the falling edge, and backed up to the wall. They had to think of a way to get out and fast. But, wait! Where the hell is Carly? \"Nick, where's Carly?\" \"She went through a door when she ran out of the room. Come on, babe. She's fine, but we have to get the hell out of here.\" When Riley placed her hand on the wall, the wall began to move. The light bulb went off in Riley's head. \"Nick, the wall!\" Nick turned around and both of them began to dig at the wall. \"Dig!\" \"Come on! Faster! Faster!\" \"Come on Riley! Faster!\" Riley's fingers felt the breeze of summer night. With one big tug, Riley could see the outside. Nick pushed Riley through the opening they made, and Nick jumped up behind her just as the floor that would've been beneath them fell into the fire below. She realized they were in the title of the house, and waited a moment while the building began to fall down. Then they slide right out. They walked over to the end of the little road, and turned back to look at the house before them burn down. Riley turned to Nick. \"Come on.\" She grabbed Nick by the arm to help him walk. She led him down the road and sat him down out of the reach of fire. \"Are you okay?\" She reached down and looked at him leg. \"I'm fine.\" Nick grabbed Riley's hand and stopped her from touching his cut. Riley took the hint and sat down beside Nick. The two sat in silence just looking up at the stars. \"See, this is why I don't like football.\" Nick laughed at Riley. \"There you two are!\" Riley looked over to see Carly running over to them. Riley got up and walked over to hug Carly tight. \"Where the hell did you run too?\" Riley said as she pulled back. \"I'm so sorry. I panicked! I just ran for it. Then I found Nick and I told him you were still in the room with Vincent, he went after you and I found a door that led downstairs and I found another door that led outside.\" Riley could only shake her head. \"You selfish bitch.\" Riley couldn't be mad at her though. She was just glad she was alive. Riley and Carly walked back over to sit next to Nick. \"What do we do know?\" Nick asked looking at the town in flames around them. \"Well, it's a shame that this entire town is pretty much gone. I mean all this wax stuff was really neat.\" Carly looked over at Riley in shock. \"Well, minus the fact that there were people under there.\" The three just sat there for the longest time. Enjoying the fact they were still alive. No sooner the sun came up and in the distance they could hear the sound of police cars approaching. In no time, there were police and ambulances' surrounding the street. \"Oh, thank God.\" An officer stepped out and introduced himself and helped them into the ambulance to tend to their wounds. \"Hey, that's my friends' camera. Hey, that's my friend's camera.\" Nick said sitting on the back of the car, as a police officer walked by with Dalton's camera. There was a lot of movement going around them with men getting all the bodies out of the remaining buildings and putting them into body bags. Riley sighed and placed her head on the side of the car from where she was sitting on the back of the ambulance below Nick's feet. \"Sorry, son. That's evidence.\" Another police officer said coming up to the ambulance to address the three in the car. \"Are you guys okay?\" They all just looked at the officer as if giving him that look that said, \"Are you serious?\" \"Well, don't worry. We'll get you to the hospital.\" \"How could no one have known about all this?\" Carly asked after her finger was all wrapped up. \"Truth is this town is hard as hell to get to. It's been abandoned 10 years, ever since the sugar mill shut down. Hell, it ain't even on the map anymore. We found all those cars in that old factory. Those Sinclair boys pulled people off the interstate for years. If it wasn't for all that smoke from the fire,\" He shook his head, \"we wouldn't have even known.\" Nick looked over at Carly and Riley. Riley shook her head and wrapped her arms around herself. The officer excused himself before Nick spoke up. \"Come here, babe.\" Riley looked over at Nick and ran into his arms. She didn't know why but she began crying. \"It's alright. We're safe.\" She just wanted things to be like this; here in his arms knowing that everything was going to be okay, and nothing could get to her. \"Ma'am if you could come with us, we'd like to get these two to the hospital.\" An officer came up behind Riley and patted her on the back. \"Why does she have to leave?\" Nick said grabbing a hold of her arm to prevent her from going anywhere. \"We'd like to get you two to a hospital.\" The officer replied. \"I want her to be with me.\" The officer paused before holding up his hands in surrender before stepping away from the group. Riley got into the car so the man could close to door. She sat on the other side of Nick and waited for the car to start. Nick leaned over and pulled out the camera from his side. \"Maybe there are some good memories on this.\" \"You took it?\" Carly said with an amused voice. \"It just felt wrong leaving it behind.\" He paused to look down at his best friend's camera, and then up to meet Carly's eyes, \"You know?\" \"You okay?\" He smiled pulling Riley and Carly into him for a hug. \"We're okay\" He kissed the top of the girls head and looked out the back window. Riley looked over to see that nasty man from the pile of filth sitting in his truck with the dog beside him waving at them. A shiver went down Riley's body. \"Babe, you have to promise me that we will never go to a football game, and camp out ever again.\" Riley looked up in Nick's eyes. \"I promise.\" He said smiling he leaned his head down to capture him lips with hers. \"Can you at least wait to do that?\" They pulled apart at the sound of Carly's voice. Riley reached over and grabbed her hand. Together the three sat in the car with the comfort of being in each other's safe embrace.

Published: 8-20-205 Unedited ○◦○ Meeting New People ○◦○ (ah-LEE-nah) The hot steam spread throughout the small simple bathroom, creating a cloud-like fog. The sound of cascading water and a soft humming echoed in the steamed bathroom. The figure of a young woman could be seen through a glass door, blurred by the steam. The young women continued to hum the melody of a song as she washed the remaining shampoo, and hair dye, out of her waist length hair. Once finished with the task, she turned the water off, proceeding to step out of the shower cubicle. Reaching for a towel, the young women wrapped it around herself as she made her way towards the mirror situated above the counter. Pressing her manicured hand against the cool surface of the mirror - even with the humidness in the restroom - she wiped away the condensation. Smiling at her reflection, the young women reached for her hair admiring the burgundy color it now had. No longer was her a light brown color, but more on the red-burgundy side. It was a nice change and she was sure that once her hair was dried, the color would look great on her. It was a nice combination to her nice olive skin and it made her light blue eyes - almost grey - really stand out. With her smile growing some more, she turned away from her reflection and walked towards the only door in the bathroom that lead to her room. She shivered as the cool air touched her bare skin but didn't pay much attention to it as she quickly began to get dressed. She wore a pair of nice shorts that made her toned legs look much longer. Pairing the shorts with a blue thin-strapped cami and a simple black leather jacket. She decided to finish it off with her mid-calf combat boots. Taking a quick glance at the time on her phone, she noticed it was 1:40 in the afternoon. Deciding she still had some time she began to do her make up and hair. Thirty minutes later, she had done her make up and was halfway done with her hair when her phone rang. Grabbing her cell phone she answered, \"Hello?\" \"Hey, it's me,\" came a female's voice from the phone. The young girl smiled knowing exactly who it was. \"Hey, Carly. You almost here?\" \"Yeah, that's why I called. I'm about five minutes away from your place,\" Carly replied. \"Perfect! I'll be waiting. Remember it's apartment '2A',\" the young women said. After Carly's confirmation, they both hung up and the young woman continued on her hair. She had a mixture of feelings going through her at the moment. She was excited and nervous all at once. Her friend from college and classmate, Carly, was going to introduce her to her friends. The young woman was excited to meet new people since she was new in town and didn't know anybody beside Carly. She had met Carly in one of the classes they shared together and instantly became friends with her. That was about three months ago and throughout those months, Carly kept trying to convince her to meet her friends, but the young girl never had the time. She was either too busy studying or working. Though she had met Carly's boyfriend, Wade, once or twice, but that was about it. Now she had finally found the time to meet them and hopefully make some new friends out of them, too. But that's what also made her nervous. She didn't know if they were going to like and accept her as their friend. Carly insisted that she would get along just fine with them, but it didn't stop her nervousness. ❉❉❉ -*H*O*W*- ❉❉❉ True to her word, Carly was at the young girls apartment door knocking, in five minutes. Upon hearing the knocking, the young girl gave herself a once over just to make sure she looked alright before making her way towards the front door. The young girl finally opened the door to reveal Carly - who had a huge smile on her face. Spreading out her arms, Carly pulled the young girl into a friendly hug. \"Ready to go?\" Carly asks, pulling away from the hug. \"Yeah, let me just get my keys and phone,\" replied the young girl. She walked over to a small table a few feet away and retrieved said items. Quickly following Carly out the door and locking it on the process. \"You look great, Alina. Plus, I'm loving the new hair!\" Carly reached out a hand to touch her friends her. The young girl, Alina, just gave a small laugh at her friends compliment. \"Thanks, I thought it was time for a new change. I was getting tired of my natural hair color.\" The girls continued to talk as they walked towards Carly's car. They both got in and soon were off to meet up with the rest of Carly's friends. They arrived at a decent sized house that had a nice blue 2003 Mustang Cobra parked in the driveway. Carly parked the small car she drove -which Alina found out belonged to Wade- behind the truck in the driveway. The car was a red 1968 Dodge Charger. It was a nice car, there was no denying that, but it was pretty small. Though, it was most likely just used for two (Wade and Carly). Alina and Carly both stepped out of the car; Alina following behind Carly as she walked towards the back area of the house. Assuming that the little gathering was being held in the backyard, Alina did not question Carly. She, however, was proven correct when they rounded a corner and were met by a group of three people chatting and laughing. Standing by a grill was a young dark skinned man, who had his arm wrapped around a thin-pretty blonde haired girl. Across from them was another young man she had met before; Wade. \"Hey, guys!\" Carly called out, grabbing the attention of the small group. They all greeted back with a 'hey' of their own. Alina continued to follow behind Carly as she greeted her friends with a hug and Wade with a small kiss. Saying her last 'hello's', Carly wrapped an arm around Wade's waist and turned to Alina. \"Guys, I want you to meet my friend Alina. She's the one I've been telling you about.\" \"Nice to meet you. I'm Blake,\" Said the dark skinned man, outstretching his arm for a shake. Take his hand in hers, Alina replied, \"Nice to meet you too, Blake.\" \"Hi, I'm Paige.\" The young blonde women replied shaking Alina's hand as well. \"And you already know, Wade\" Carly said, as she looked up at Wade. Alina nodded and greeted Wade. \"Now that you've all said your hellos, can someone tell me where my brother and Dalton are?\" \"They're on their way. Dalton is borrowing his dad's car and Nick is coming with him,\" Blake answered. He reached over for his beer bottle and taking a drink, then went to flip the patty on the grill. \"Would you like anything to drink, Alina? We've got beer.\" He said over his shoulder at her. \"A beer is fine, thank you,\" Alina replied. \"How old are you, by the way?\" Blake asked handing her a beer he grabbed from the cooler. \"Thank you, and I'm twenty one.\" Blake nodded and returned to flipping the patties on the grill. Alina took a small drink from the beer and cringed a little from the taste. She wasn't a big drinker, but did have one once in a while. \"So? Where are you from?\" Paige asked as she sat on a chair. Alina followed her actions and sat on one herself. Wade did the same and sat on one across from the two girls. Carly found her way into Wade's lap and began to talk to him quietly. \"I'm from Seattle.\" Both girls continued to talk some more about Alina's life back in Seattle and about how she liked Florida. Blake, Wade and Carly joined in on the conversation. Mention things they knew from both experience or of what they've heard about Seattle or Washington itself. Alina was really starting to get along with them so far. They seemed to have accepted her, but then again, it was only three of them out of the five Carly had mentioned. Nevertheless, Alina was happy that she knew more people. Fifteen minutes later, Alina stood up, \"Sorry, but I was wondering if I may use your bathroom?\" Blake nodded and gave her directions to where it was located. Excusing herself, she made her way into the house and towards the bathroom. As Alina walked away from the group, Paige turned to Carly with a smile on her face. \"I like her. She seems very nice.\" \"Yeah, I have to agree with that,\" Blake quickly added in, with a nod. \"I'm glad you guys think that. She really needed some people to hang out with.\" Carly replied, as the rest nodded their heads in understanding. Just then, all three of them hear a car pull up and doors opening and slamming. Nick and Dalton appear around the corner and make their way towards the small group. \"It's about time,\" Carly said with a hint of annoyance. \"Sorry, had to get my hair done,\" Nick replied sarcastically, to which Carly rolled her eyes. Nick just shrugged it off and greeted Paige and Blake, giving Wade a small nod. Carly just let out a defeated breath knowing how Nick was lately. They had both been very close before, but as time passed by and they grew up, they easily became annoyed by the other. Nick was mostly annoyed about how everyone would find someway to compare him to Carly and say how good she was. As for Carly, she became annoyed at how Nick let it get to his head and began to act like he just didn't care about anything. Like Nick would always say; she's the good twin, and he's the evil twin… Nick walked over to where Dalton stood next to the cooler. Just as Nick was about to bend down and grab a beer for himself, Dalton stopped him. \"There's no more, man. 'Got the last one. Sorry.\" Looking up, Nick saw Dalton lift up his beer bottle at him. \"You suck, man!\" Nick said to Dalton before turning to Blake, \"Ay, man! We're out!\" \"There's some more in the house,\" Blake replied returning to the conversation he was having with Wade. Nick gave a huff of annoyance in having to go get the beer from the house. He made his way inside the house and into the kitchen. Opening the refrigerator's door, he bend down a bit to grab a couple of the beer bottle that were in the. With his hands full, he kicked the door close- turning around to head back outside. Alina was making her way back out towards the backyard-after doing her business- but was stopped, when she gave a small scream. Not seeing Nick as she turned the corner, she accidentally bumped into him. Luckily, for Nick, he had a tight hold on the drinks in his arms and managed to avoid dropping them when Alina bumped into him. \"I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there.\" Alina tried to apologize, feeling like a fool for not paying attention to where she walked. Nick looked at her and smirked; finding her semi-frantic state a bit amusing. \"It's all cool. No harm no, no foul.\" Alina let out a small breath of relief, knowing that he wasn't upset with her. \"You must be Carl's friend, huh?\" Nick asked, though, it was more of a statement since he knew it was her. Mainly since she was the only new face there. \"Oh! Uh,yeah! I'm Alina.\" Alina replied. \"Do you need some help with that?\" \"Yeah, thanks. I'm Nick, by the way; Carly's brother.\" Nick handed Alina a couple of beers over to Alina as they began to make their way back out to join the others. As soon as they walked back out, Carly spotted them and made her way up to them. As she reached them, she gave her twin brother a look to which he only rolled his eyes at. When her attention was on Alina, she smiled and told her there was one more person she had yet to meet; Dalton. Once Alina had officially met everyone, Carly turned to her, \"Great! Now that you've met the gang, it's time to have some fun!\" DISCLAIMER: I do not own the movie House Of Wax (2005). All credit goes to the rightful owners.

Her laughter rang throughout the shop, grabbing the attention of both the tattoo artist and the client he was currently working on. \"Nick! Stop, that is not how I remember it happening,\" Alina laughed. Nick let out a chuckle and pulled her against his side, \"I'm pretty sure it was like that, babe.\" He kissed the side of her head as she rolled her eyes, giving up on wanting to show him he was wrong. It had been exactly a year and a half since Carly introduced Alina to her friends. They all accepted her with open arms into their small little group. Alina could say that they were all (in some way) her best friends. The ones she knew she could trust, no matter what. Within, that year and a half, Nick and Alina began to get closer. Within the two months of meeting eachother, they began to go out and then proceeded to making it official. Carly wasn't completely fond of the idea at first, but after witnessing how the two were with each other- she came to accept it. The couple walked up to the counter, to were a woman around her early thirties stood. She looked up and smiled, \"Hello, how can I help you?\" She was a pretty. With bright red hair and many tattoos and piercing covering her body, that complimented her just right. \"Hi, I'm here for my seven o'clock appointment,\" Alina replied. Alina had been waiting for this for the past week. After a long time of thinking, she had come to the conclusion that she wanted to get a tattoo. Though, she would always procrastinate in getting it done, for the sole fact that she didn't know WHAT to get. She knew she wanted something that held meaning to it and wasn't just one of those things she would end up regretting in the future. So with the help of Nick, she finally found something she wanted and was ready to get it tattooed. \"Okay, I have you here. Scott, over there, is just about done with his client \" the girl behind the counter pointed at the tattoo artist, who was in fact finished with his client and was wiping down his station. \"Just give him a couple of minutes to clean up and he'll be right right with you.\" True to her word, a couple of minutes (after Nick and Alina took a seat to wait) Scott walked over and told them he was Alina and Nick stood and walked over to Scott's station, hand in hand. After sitting on the chair, Alina let Scott know what she wanted done. \" I want the phrase ' with pain, comes strength' going across my rib.\" Alina said, while at the same time lifting up her shirt to show the tattoo artist where. \"Are you sure? Getting tattooed on the ribs is pretty painful...\" \"Yeah, I'm sure.\" •~•~•~•~• \"So? How was it?\" Nick asked as they drove through town, looking for a place to have dinner. \"Painful\" Alina winced. Nick let out a small laugh at his girlfriend. Truth is, Nick knew how having a needle puncture through your skin a thousand times felt. He, himself, had a tattoo on his upper arm. Though from the looks of it, and how hard Alina held on to his hand, he could assume hers was a little more painful. Looking over at his girlfriend, he could not help but to think back to when she had finally agreed to go on a date with him... •Flash Back• Alina groaned for what seemed like the hundredth time in the last hour. Nick kept insisting she go on a date with him that weekend. Though, if she were being honest, the truth was that she secretly liked how persistent he was. After the two months of knowing him, she began to crush on him. She was just playing hard to get. Nick knew she liked him. It was pretty obvious. He didn't mind one bit, due to the fact that he like her too. He liked her personality and she definitely was nothing like the other girls he had dated in the past. They were either clingy or just annoying. The only reason he stayed was for the sex. He wasn't one to sleep with different girls (thought it might seem like it). He like having a relationship and being in one for that. He never had a relationship that lasted more than a month or two. However, with Alina, it was different. He truly liked her to the point where he saw that relationship lasting. Therefore, he vowed that he will not stop until she agreed to go on a date with him. \"Come on, Lina. We both know you want to say yes.\" \"No.\" Alina replied, while her heart fluttered at the nickname he had for her. He was the only one to call her like that. \"I'm not gonna stop until you say yes. I have all day.\" Groaning, once more, she finally gave in \"Fine! I'll go on a date with you, just stop asking.\" \"It's a date then. I'll pick you up on Saturday at 7,\" Nick grinned. •FB End• Alina looked over at Nick and saw a distant look on his face. She would have been worried that something might have been wrong with him, if the small smile he had wasn't there. Ignoring the slight burning pain on her right side of her ribs, she asked, \"What are you thinking about?\" Nick snapped out of his trance and gave a quick look over at her. \"Oh..nothing just thinking.\" \"Just thinking?\" \"Yeah. Just thinking...Watch it, asshole!\" Alina couldn't hold the small laugh that escaped her as Nick yelled at a driver who almost bumped into their car. If she were someone else then she might have been scared of the situation, but this was Nick. He has the tendency of getting upset quickly. Though, that situation did justify his actions at the moment. She stared at him and just took him all in. She did really love him. When she first met him, after accidentally bumping into him, she thought he was very attractive. She never thought that she would end up falling in love with him, but after the time they spent hanging out that all changed. She never regrets falling for him. Not even during their hard times, and they've had a few of those. Though, at the end, they always managed to overcome them. The most reason hardship was when Nick got kicked out of the football team and lost his scholarship. He played it off as if he didn't care, but she knew football was something he took seriously. It was sort of something he had after his parents kicked him out. Nick has always been that trouble maker. The one who does; before he thinks. That ' I don't care' attitude. Now that she thought about it, Nick and herself had never had a bad argument like that time he went over to their shared apartment after getting kicked off the football team. Thinking back at it, she let out a small wince, but not from the pain on her side, but at the memory… •Flash Back• Alina was in the bedroom she shared with Nick fixing some clothes, when she heard the front door slam shut. Quickly putting down the shirt she had, she walked out of the room calling out, \"Nick? Is that you?\" Alina never got a response as she made her way in to the living room. There Nick stood pacing angrily, with an aggravated look. Taking a quick look at the clock on the wall, Alina noticed it was 4:30 in the afternoon. Nick was not suppose to be home until around 8 that evening. \" Hey, are you okay? What are you doing back so early? I thought you had practice today?\" Alina asked, wanting to know what was wrong with him. \" Yeah, well I don't!\" Nick snapped at her. Alina flinched, taken back by his attitude towards her. Now she really wanted to know what was wrong. Nick gets mad easily, but he never takes it out on her. However, it seemed like today was going to be different. \"Okay, what's wrong?\" \" You want to know what's wrong, Alina?! I got kicked off the football team. That's what's wrong!\" Nick didn't even wait for her response as he made his way towards their bedroom. Alina followed after him, ignoring the little pang she felt at him using her full name instead of the nickname he gave her. \" What do you mean you got kicked off the team? What the hell happened?\" She asked almost desperately \" I already told you, Alina. I got kicked off, okay? Just drop it, I don't want to talk about it. I'm going to take a shower. Have some food ready by the time I get it out.\" He walked towards the bathroom door, while taking off his shirt. Alina's face when from hurt to mad in a split of a second. \" Fuck you, Nick! I'm not your fucking maid to be ordered around. Last time I checked I was your girlfriend! It's not my fault you're mad and that for some reason you think it's fine to take it out on me!\" Alina exclaimed at him. \" I never said you were my fucking maid, Alina!\" Nick yelled back, as he walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. \" Well you sure made it sound like that,\" she hissed. \" What do you freaking want me to tell you?\" \" Oh, I don't know, maybe just talk to me about what happened? Not keep it bottled up…\" Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, Nick finally spoke up in a much calmer voice, \"Look, Lina… I'm sorry, okay? I'm just upset over all of this. You know how much football means to me.\" I stayed quiet just letting him vent out. \"I guess it's all my fault, though. I've just been stressing out over trying to keep my grades up, finding a good job, and then, having to deal with football. It's caused me to skip practices and shit.\" I sighed and walked up to him wrapping my arms around his waist and resting my head on his chest. He wrapped his arms around me, holding me tight. \"It's okay, Nick. Just, please don't let out all that anger on me, and instead talk to me about it… Promise?\" \" Promise.\" •FB End• After that day, nothing as bad had happened. They still had their small fight, but they were nothing compared to that one. Though, unknown to both, a much bigger storm was going to make itself known in a couple months time. One that would separate both of them. Published : 8-28-2015 Unedited[Chapter 3] A/N: Sorry I couldn't update on Friday. My WiFi was down and I was finally able to update today. Any who, on Friday's chapter we will begin the movie plot. This chapter is a little crappy and short, but it gets right to the point. Enjoy & don't forget to review! ○◦○The Breakup○◦○ It had been a couple of months since Nick had taken Alina to get her tattoo done and things had been going great for everyone. They would all get together once in a while and just hang out. Blake would sometimes bring up his favorite college football team and talk about how he would go to the final game if they made it. He was obsessed with that team it was pretty weird. But, hey, it was Blake. Carly and Wade were still going good, though, Wade still stirred clear from Nick whenever the whole gang would get together. Alina found it amusing at times. Alina sat across from Carly in her table as they looked over Carly's internship applications. Carly was planning to apply to different places to help her career in journalism in hopes that she would get accepted in one of them. So far, the girls had gone over a few places that Carly thought could be potentials, while there were others she just didn't even think about giving them a second look. She knew that if she wanted her career to work out, she had to take some risks and apply for some of the bigger places. \"Here, why don't you apply for In-Style? They're a pretty good magazine, plus it's in New York!\" Alina pointed out, as she looked over the magazine's website. \"Yeah, why not? Though, I doubt they will consider me. I'm sure there are hundreds of others wanting to intern for them. But let's give it a try.\" Carly says, filling out the application and sending in everything they require through e-mail. \"Now we wait for a call telling saying you have an interview. Then, hopefully, you get the spot!\" Alina was excited for her friend. She knew that Carly would do a great job and work her ass off as an intern, any where that took her. \"So? What about you? What's next for you?\" \"Well, once this year is over I will have my BSN. Then, go to school for another two years to get my MSN. Once that's done, I apply to a good hospital.\" Alina replies. She's always known that once she grew up, she wanted to become nurse. Her parents would always ask why she didn't just become a doctor, to which she would always reply; 'Being a doctor puts a lot more of a responsibility on me, than becoming a Registered Nurse. I could still help people, but not carry that much weight on my shoulders...' That was Alina's answer every time and it never changed. Plus, she hated having to spent so much time in school. She already had to endure 12 years of school from elementary to high school and that was not including pre-school. Then another 6 years to become a registered nurse. If she became a doctor, then all her life might have been about school. So yeah, Alina hated having to attend school so much. \"Well then, just two more years and I'll be the one helping you out with applications\" Carly says looking over at her friend. \"So? Where's my brother haven't seen him in a while…\" \"He left early today. Said something about meeting up with Dalton.\" Nick had received a phone call from his best friend Dalton early that day telling him he needed to talk. Alina wasn't sure what was going on, all she knew was that as soon as Nick finished his call with Dalton, he left saying he would be back later. \"Wonder what those two are getting themselves into?\" Carly joked, rolling her eyes. \"It's like the three musketeers, except they don't have the third musketeer,\" Alina laughed. The girls joked around some more, making fun of Nick and Dalton and their friendship that some how got them into more trouble that they could wish for. Though, both girls didn't know how right they were about the boys getting into trouble and just how much it would be, until a knock came from Alina's apartment door. Standing up from her seat, she made her way towards the front door and opened it. Standing in the other side of the door were two police officers. Alina's heart began to beat quickly at the sight of them, not knowing why they were there. \"Hello, ma'am. Are you the girlfriend of Nick Jones?\" At hearing her boyfriends name, Alina began to worry. Did something happen to Nick? Was he okay? Where was he? Were some of the questions going through Alina's head. Alina was too caught up in her own mind, that she didn't notice when Carly joined her side and answered the question for her. \"Yes, she is. I'm his sister Carly. Is there something wrong?\" \"Hello, . Your brother has been arrested for theft of a vehicle and evading arrest. We are here to ask you some questions if that is okay?\" After that, everything seemed be like a blur to Alina. The officers had come in and asked both her and Carly a few question that she tried to answer, but found it hard to speak after she learned that Nick would be going to jail for sometime if the judge found him guilty. She knew that it would most likely come to that, if he did steal a car and evade arrest. It was times like these that she wished her boyfriend wouldn't be such a hothead. Now, she laid on her side of the bed just staring up at the white ceiling of the bedroom she shared with Nick. It was around 8 in the evening and around this time she would usually be up and doing anything, but knowing the situation her boyfriend of two years now was locked away, she just couldn't find the energy in her to do anything. So, she decided to call it a day and try to will herself to sleep. Twenty minutes later, her eyes finally began to close until darkness consumed her. • ~•~•~•~• Five months later, Alina found herself sitting behind a glass window while Nick sat on the other side. Both holding on to a phone as they looked at eachother. A week after Nick was arrested, he had his hearing where the judged ended up giving him a fine of $1,000 and a year in County jail. She wasn't sure what the hell had happened that day in the court and what was being said. All she got out of it was that her boyfriend would be in jail for a year. She honestly didn't know what to think. She knew that Nick had done other things that could get him arrested before, but this time he actually did get arrested. Nick sighed, as he looked at his girlfriend. He knew that this was hard for her. He thought that she would not want anything to do with him when he got arrested, but here she was, five months into his sentence. Three months into his sentence, he told her the truth about that day. He told her how he had covered up for Dalton. At first she had been pissed at him that she had not visited him in two weeks, but eventually she came around and understood where Nick was coming from. He knew that she would always be there by his side no matter what, and for that very reason and seeing her right in front of him, he knew that what he was going to do was for the best. She deserved better than having to visit her boyfriend in jail every week. She needed someone that was actually going to be out there in the real world with her. She shouldn't have to be stuck with him while he was away. She shouldn't have to deal with his problems. Therefore, even though it killed him to do it, he had to let her go. \"Alina…\" As soon as her full name escaped his lips, she knew that today's visit was not going to be like the others. \"I can't do this anymore. You shouldn't have to deal with this… We need to breakup.\" Alina sat there in shock, not knowing what had just happened. By the time she had gotten herself together, Nick was already being escorted out of the visiting room by an officer. Alina sat there with tears streaming down her face, staring at the door Nick disappeared through. Just like that, her relationship with Nick Jones was over. Published: 9-6-2015 Unedited[Chapter 4] So It Begins...○◦○ Alina walked around her apartment's living room making sure she had everything she needed, for this road trip/ camping trip Blake had planned out a year ago. At first, Alina was all about going and having a good time with her friends, but after the breakup with Nick, she became a shell of herself. It had taken Carly and Paige an entire two months to get her back to her normal self; well as much as they could, at least. As far as this trip went, she had cancelled out on her friends saying that she wasn't really up to it anymore. Especially, since it was going to be couples only. Carly had told her that even though Nick was released from jail a month ago, both he and Dalton were not going to be going on the trip. Alina was still unconvinced, but eventually agreed to go as long as Nick wasn't going. She had not seen him since he broke up with her, and was not ready to do so anytime soon. Of course she still loved him, but she was hurt. Eventually, that hurt turned into anger. She was so angry that he just ended things the way he did. She couldn't believe that he didn't let her talk and tell him that she didn't care if he was going to be locked up for a year; that she was only going to see him once or twice every two weeks; that no matter what, she was going to wait for him because she loved him enough to do so. So, it was a mixture of both anger and hurt that she felt and still continues to feel since that day. Hearing a car honk outside, Alina quickly grabbed her bag - that contained extra pair of clothes- and her tent. Quickly putting on her sunglasses, she walked out the door locking it in the process. As she made her way to her apartment's parking lot, she spotted Blake's new blue 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche he had recently bought. Parked beside them was Wade's 1968 Dodge Charger. Blake and Paige both stepped out of his truck walking up to her. Once Blake greeted Alina with a hug, he proceeded to help her with the tent and put it on the bed of his truck while Paige greeted her next. Pulling away from the hug, Alina noticed Carly get out of Wade's car and make her way towards them. What caught Alina's attention though, was the guilty look Carly had. Looking over at Paige, she saw the same look on her face. \"Hey, Alina.\" Carly greeted her with a hug. \"Hey… Is something wrong? You have this look on your face…\" Alina asked, not knowing what to expect when they told her. \"Look, before I tell you, just know that it was Blake's idea. Okay?\" Carly said, holding on to her friend's arms gently. Paige nodded her head in agreement with Carly. Now Alina definitely didn't know if she should be feeling worried or not. \"Dalton is coming with us to the game…\" Alina knew what Carly was going to say before she even said it. If Dalton was going, then HE was going, too. \"And so is Nick.\" Alina stayed quiet, taking in the new information. After a couple of seconds, she finally nodded her head slowly. \"Okay, but I'm riding with Paige and Blake.\" \"That's perfectly fine. Now come on before Blake blows a casket if we hold them up anymore than we already have.\" Paige stated, pulling Alina towards the truck and a waiting Blake. Not once did Alina turn to Wade's car to see if he really was there, even if she knew he was. She just wanted to get going and get herself prepared for the encounter she knew was unavoidable. *H*O*W* A couple of hours and a lot of thinking in Alina's part, the two vehicle pulled into a small diner off the freeway. Everybody stepped out stretching their stiff bodies, trying to get the knots that had build up from the stiffness out. Avoiding Nick seemed to be impossible for Alina. As she was making her way towards the only two other girls in the group, Nick stepped in front of her, blocking her path. Alina's heart hammered against her chest as she looked up to meet her ex-boyfriend's eyes. She had been preparing herself on the car ride, ever since Carly told her the news, but she still found it a little hard to stare up into the eyes of the man she loved and hurt her. \"Can we talk?... Please?\" His voice was quietly and pleading. He just wanted the chance to talk to her and make her stop hating him, even if she didn't; it still felt like it. \"There's nothing to talk about, Nick… You said all you needed to say, remember?\" With that, Alina walked away from him. She thought she would be able to talk to him, but she just couldn't and even though she felt like a coward for walking away, it was for her best. If she stayed there any longer, she was sure a flood of tears would run down her face. Reaching both Carly and Paige, all three girls made their way into the diner to grab something to eat. Carly seeing the look her brother had after Alina walked away, couldn't help but feel bad for him. He might have been fighting with her a lot lately over what happened a year when he went to jail, but at the end of the day; he was her brother and just wanted to see him happy. Even if he was a complete asshole at times. After grabbing their food, the girls made their way towards a picnic table outside the diner. The boys were off doing their own things for a while before they got on the road again. Sitting down across Carly and Paige, Alina pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw. Drawing was always a big hobby of hers. As far as she could remember, Alina always had a pencil and paper in hand. Whenever one of her friends asked her why she did pursue that career, she would just say that all it was, was a hobby nothing too serious. Across from her, Carly pulled out a newspaper and began to look through it in hopes of finding a good affordable place to live in, while she interned in New York for Instyle magazine. Alina was so happy for her friend when she found out that she was accepted after an interview a couple of months after putting in the application. Though, recently, it was because of this her and Wade were having a hard time. \"There's a place in Tribeca for three-thousand,\" Paige pointed out, as she ate one of her french fries. Alina leaned over to look at the small article Paige was pointing at on the newspaper. The place seemed pretty good, but she wasn't sure if Carly was going to be able to pay so much. Leaning back, Alina continued on her drawing, while still listening to her two friends. \"That's still too expensive. All the money I've saved won't even cover two months' rent,\" Carly explained to Paige. \"She's right. She's gonna have to work every second she not in class to try and make that.\" Alina helped out. After finding out Carly was accepted into the internship spot, she was determined to work as much as she could until graduation to make some money to move to New York and begin her internship. \"Plus, she only has until graduation.\" Letting out a sigh, Paige looked at her friend, \"Carly, don't even think about not going.\" \"I'm not.\" \"You sure? 'Cause you have this look on your face…\" Alina trailed off, as she joked. \"Yes, I'm sure.\" Carly tittered. \"Good. Because you know we're proud of you.\" Paiged stated. \"It's just an internship,\" Carly replied nonchalantly . Alina stopped drawing and looked up at Paige when she heard her friend say it like it was no big deal. She did not see how her friend can be so dismissive over something like that. \"At Instyle magazine. Which, let's not forget, I told you to apply for.\" Alina declared. \"Alinas right. Or, would you rather stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" Paige asked. \"No thanks.\" All three girls laughed at that. Alina saw Wade walk towards them and smiled his way, as he reached them. Carly grabbed the Instyle magazine that was sitting in front of her and began to skim through at as Wade greeted her. \"Hey, babe. Sorry, there were these two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.\" Wade explained his tardiness, chewing on the toothpick he had. \"Really?\" Carly asked, not quite believing her boyfriend. \"There's no rednecks in New York,\" Paige said, earning a kick from Alina under the table. Alina noticing the look Wade had, gave Paige a look of her own, trying to tell her to not push it. They both knew Wade wasn't so font on the whole moving to New York plan. Paige taking the hint, stood up from the table, announcing she was going to go meet up with Blake. Now that it was only them three, Alina grabbed her iPod Nano and decided to listen to some music,and once again went back to drawing and eating a fry once in awhile; not wanting to get involved in the couple's business. Not much later, Alina felt some sit next to her. She lifted her head to see Nick was the one. He sat with his legs on each side of the bench facing her. On her other side, Dalton sat down with his camera, recording everyone on the table. Alina sat up straight, removing her earphones and putting her Ipod away. She bit down on her lip trying to avoid Nick's eyes and decided to just stare at her drawing. \"So, what do you think, guys? Gonna be a sweet tomorrow, huh?\" Wade asked, trying to break the tension. \"Yeah.\" Nick laughed sarcastically. Dalton on the other hand just mocked Wade. Alina knew that both Nick and Dalton didn't like Wade, but she didn't think it was necessary to be assholes. Though it was mostly Nick, and Dalton just went along with it. Once Dalton began to film Carly and her asking him to not, Alina knew that Nick was going to say something. She had heard from Carly enough to know that her relationship with her brother was pretty rocky. \"Hey, come on. Put the camera down. You know she doesn't like people up on her face\" Nick said, reaching over Alina to push Dalton's camera down. \"She folds under pressure.\" \"Nick, you got something to say to me?\" Carly asks, forcibly closing the magazine. \"No. I think you've spoken enough for all three of us, don't you?\" Alina knew he was including her in there. Which kind of irritated her, that he could not let something go. What was Carly suppose to say to the cops. \"Jesus, Nick!\" Alina cried out, grabbing her belongings leaving the table not wanting to deal with any of that. Heading towards where Blake and Paige, she decided to just wait in the truck until everyone was ready to go. Paige seeing her friend make her way towards her, decided she needed to ask for a favor. \"Hey, Alina, I need to ask for a favor\" Paige said, pulling her towards a more private area. \"Okay.\" \"You know, how Told you and Carly that I might be pregnant-\" \"Are you? \" Alina cut her off, wanting to know if she was certain now. \"No, well I don't know yet. But I want to talk to him about, just incase I am… So I was wondering if maybe you could ride with the others, so that I could talk to him in private…\" Paige pleaded. Letting out a breath, Alina agreed with Paige. She knew that this was something that had to be done in private between Blake and Paige. Now all she has to worry about is a very awkward and tense car ride with her ex. Published: 9-11-2015 Unedited ** I just want to take a moment and ask for a minute of silence in the memory of the events of September 11, 2001.

Please enjoy! And Review! ○◦○Camp-Out Pt.1○◦○ Awkward. Complete and utter awkwardness, is what Alina felt. Let's not forget the fact that she was sitting stiff as a stick as well. She cursed Paige so many times in her head, that she almost gave herself a headache trying to come up with new curses she had yet to use. Out of all the the different seats she could be sitting at the moment, she had to be stuck in between Nick and Dalton. The awkwardness between her and Nick was just ridiculous. Everyone in the car could feel it, but all decided to stay quiet. Plus, it did not help that she had to sit at such close proximity to him, all thanks to Wade's small car. Sure Dalton could have sat in the middle instead of herself, but it would have been even more cramped than it already was. Closing her eyes and letting out a small sigh, she decided to relax; if not, than she was sure to get some sort of cramp. Through the corner of her eye, she saw Nick leaning against the window. She had been stealing glances at him for the past hour and a half they had been driving. She would kick herself mentally for that, but she continued to do it either way. He saw how stiff she had gotten as soon as she sat next to him, before they left the diner. He wanted to give her room, therefore he was leaning against the window, making as much room between them as possible. He could feel the awkward tension and tried his best to ignore it by trying to get some shut eye. A few minutes passed by as they continued the drive. Not being able to take the quietness any longer, Alina sat forward and spoke to Wade, \"Hey, Wade? Can you put the radio on, please?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" He replied, turning on the radio. Truth was he was kind of relieved she asked. He too could not take the quietness. \"Thanks.\" \"Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year…\" a man's voice announced through the radio, as he talked about the football game they were all heading to. \"... As Louisiana and Florida…\" Hearing this, Wade said, \"It's gonna be packed tomorrow.\" \"Really?\" Alina asked mockingly at Wade, though she spoke with a tone of playfulness to let him know it just a joke. This received her a small smile from Wade through the rearview mirror. \"Speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man.\" Dalton complained as he moved around in his seat. Alina, just leaned back against the backrest of the seat, and looked forward towards the back of Blake's truck that was driving ahead of them. \"Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault his little Hot Wheels Car only fits two.\" Nick mumbled, causing Alina to roll her eyes and closed them as she leaned her head back. Now looking up at the car's ceiling. Letting out a snort, Dalton added in \"It's more like a 'shot wheels' car, isn't it?\" However, he wasn't done there. \"What did you do, go to the barbershop and ask for a He-Man haircut?\" \"Shut up, Dalton\" Alina told him, seeing the look on Carly's face. Ignoring her, Dalton continued to chuckle at his own joke and leaned over hitting Nick on the arm. Nick letting out a chuckle of his own, also leaned over Alina to hit Dalton back. Once again, Alina rolled her eyes at them, but found it a little amusing. Feeling more crowded, she placed her hands on Nick's arm and chest, she slightly pushed him back to his own seat. As he sat back, they stared at each other, with Alina removing one hand and only leaving the one on his chest in place. God, it would have been a complete lie if she said she did not want to kiss him at that moment. But knew, it wasn't going to happen. Nick slowly placed his hand over hers and squeezing it gently, holding on to it. The only person that noticed this was Carly. Dalton was still too busy laughing with himself and Wade was focused on the road, trying not to feel hurt by what Nick and Dalton had said. She looked away, not wanting to get caught. The small moment between the ex-lovers was broken by the bright red lights of Blake's car. Removing her hand away from Nick, Alina tries to fight the heat rising in her cheeks as she looks ahead to try and see what was happening. Nick seeing this quickly asks, \"What the hell is this?\" Up ahead the road was blocked making the both cars take a detour from their original route. \"Oh, man\" Dalton complains, as Carly adds in, \"This sucks!\" \"So much for his nice little shortcut.\" Wade says sarcastically as he continues to drive behind Blake. *H*O*W* The only sounds that could be heard in the deserted road, were those of the two engines belonging to the vehicle of the fifteen minutes of driving and all that surrounded them was nothing and an endless darkness that seemed to stretch so far. \"Hey, do you guys think we're lost?\" Alina asked, noticing their surroundings. \"You might be right. Hey, babe? Pull up next to them to ask.\" Carly says. Doing what his girlfriends asks, Wade picks up the speed and pulls up next to Blake's truck muttering about 'shortcuts' and 'getting lost'. As the smaller drives next to the bigger one, Dalton notices a blonde head belonging to Paige, bobbing up and down. It would have not been such a big deal if it was not for the placement of where the bobbing was happening. Right above Blake's lap area. Or so it appeared. However, Dalton being Dalton had to point it out. \"Damn! Yo, yo, wake up! Wake up!\" Nick feeling his best friend shake him awake from the small five minute nap he was trying to take, looks towards what he was fussing about. Alina having to have Dalton lean over her to reach Nick, is also brought to what Dalton is seeing. She notices Dalton quickly reaching for his camera and begin to record the moving vehicle next to them. This time it is Alina's turn to lean over Dalton to get a view of the bobbing head. She let's out a laugh at what she sees. Everyone in the car begin to laugh and make fun of what they are seeing, Nick even goes far as to reach over Wade and honk at them. This grabs the couple's attention and realize what their friends were thinking. A few seconds later, Carly's phone begins to ring as Paige calls her. Paige begins to try and explain that she had dropped her lip balm and was only trying to retrieve it. At hearing Carly repeat her friend's words, Alina and the others begin to laugh not believing it. After a good laugh, Carly gets serious and asks about what the plan for the night would be. She patiently waits as Paige talks to Blake about it. At the end it was decided that they would camp out for the night and wake up early to get to the game on time. So, they continued to drive and try to figure out where they would camp-out at.

Honoria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13239265","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ~oOo~ Winter As Merlin vacates the warmth of his cottage, his weight shatters a thin layer of ice hidden beneath a dusting of white snow. All around him snow falls, touching the ground softly and audibly. A lantern held aloft leaves his features in partial shadow as he makes his way to the graves of his family. The area where they rest looks no different than the surrounding clearing, but Merlin knows exactly where they lie. The ground was equally as frozen when he was forced to bury the only mother he ever knew; and where she, in turn, had buried his birth mother years earlier. He kneels on the cold ground; the snow seeping into his clothes and boots, seeping into his bones and heart. He closes his eyes and tries to imagine the pair of them sitting across from him, though he does not know his mother's face. He pictures kind eyes, an affable smile. Features he somehow knows her flesh and bones molded to contain. Merlin conjures images of her speaking animatedly, head turned as she speaks to Auntie A., obtaining her opinion on something he's undertaken, then turning back to him anew. Eyes glistening, pride dwelling within them. If he could only receive her opinion, her thoughts on matters to help guide him through life. Mother, what should I do? Auntie A... it hurts to even think about her. Both were trapped in their own worlds. She'd know what to do about Queen Mab. A meek laugh expelled of energy escapes his mouth as he imagines Queen Mab being confronted by his Auntie A. He knows sadness regarding her departure is not something she'd want. He can almost hear her scolding him. \"Up on your feet boy, I'll have none of that crying. You know I'm better off than you are!\" He dries his tears on the cuff of his shirt and tries to summon the courage she'd placed in his heart. He whispers his love to the dark, for no one living can hear. Past and Future The sun was beginning to set as the crowd slowly dispersed. A pattern of footprints on the damp soil was the sole evidence that a gathering of people had moments before congregated to listen to an old man's story. Shoulder to shoulder, strangers and friends alike had become caught in the web of another person's memories, experiencing them with such a level of vividness, it was as if they were their own. Some walked away without waiting for the end, tired of his embellishment. Others did not notice the passage of time for their involvement in his story. And now, at the end of the day, Merlin was in the near dark counting his meager earnings, withdrawing and inspecting a clover bud someone had thought adequate payment. In the past he happily would have accepted flowers, weeds even, in return for something so simple as a story, but now he found resentment in the notion. He pursed his lips and shook his head. What has become of him? He sighed as he pinned the clover through a worn spot in his tattered cloak. In the box there were enough coins to purchase a modest meal for the night. Though he was famished, it would have to do. He looked forward to sitting at the table and ordering a bowl of stew, half a loaf of bread. The remuneration was placed in a drawstring bag at his waist as he started for the inn. As he passed merchant stalls, he heard a few souls acknowledge his departure. He waved or nodded to those whose eyes he met, but he did not often speak. He knew that most preferred it that way. A small child peered from the door of one of the small huts, and he lightened inwardly at the connection. He cautiously wagged a finger at the child and watched as it quickly disappeared inside the house. He was for a moment reminded of the past, an unrelated moment, when matters had been considerably different. When he was a young boy unaware of his future or the magic that existed within him. He remembered running through the woods; free and without pain. Each day had been much the same; he would wander the forest, sometimes speak to his few friends; he would gather herbs, mushrooms and berries, but always in the evening he would find himself comforted by Ambrosia, who was the same as a mother to him. She would listen as he recounted the events of the day over supper, and she would share with him stories of her day, her girlhood, her family. He would sleep at night without worry or fear, thinking only of what the next day might bring. Trivial things pleased him, a valley of violets, ripe apples, the discovery of woodland animals. He was far from that boy now. Old and a beggar. Bitter. He'd lived through such heartbreak, such incredible loss, and so much of it caused by his own folly. Not a day passed without him wishing he could go back to somehow alter matters. He consistently wished for different outcomes and played them out in his head as if ballads. Prose that would see him not on the streets selling his cherished and hard won memories for small coin, but with Nimue and the children they might have had. The life they might have gained after such sacrifice. But that was not meant to be. He feared he would never see Nimue ever again. He wasn't long for this world, but he was still a part of it. There was enough life in him to hold on to the hope that he might see Nimue in the future, in another life after this one ended. Merlin did not share Christian beliefs nor the hope to be reunited in Heaven. His ally in this case, one that no one could argue, was that death was unknown. And in the unknown there is room for hope, no matter how slight. Friends and Enemies After being dismissed from Queen Mab's services, a soldier's armor was no longer a guise for Frik but a vocation. He was daily faced with the harsh truths of the title as he wandered through mazes of bodies, those living and dead. The impenetrable fog of the forest battleground was disorienting, and from its depths escaped men from both armies. They flew past him as if possessed. The cries of the wounded and dying rose from the ground; aligned with future breezes, they were interposed with the elegies of their gravesides. Earth soft and pliable was imagined falling from the gnome's hands and onto their concealed bones. Soldiers shouted in the shrouded foreground. Unseen swords rang out against enemy blades. The world appeared to him as though tilted at an angle, a moment caught in time without hope of righting itself. It spun partially as if to complete its circle, only to repeatedly return to its previous position. To steady himself, to retreat from the battle he was hardly ready to accept, the gnome paused by a tree. After a moment, he turned as if on behalf of a whispered request, and searched the land to his side, an area framed by the branches of an oak tree. Immediately he discerned the wings of Mordred's helmet, and his eyes followed the well-known paths of his young and haughty face. The boy's lips spread to a grin as he witnessed the carnage around him, in his element. It was the same smile that had graced his face as his mother died. With the memory of Morgan's death made fresh, Frik was seized with a desire to end Mordred's life. To see him struck down and made to undergo the pain that had eluded him his entire life. To see that sly smile fade from his face. No... Morgan's voice said in his head. He's still my Mowdwed. He pictured her standing beside Mordred in the clearing, her hand on his armor covered shoulder. Her brown eyes distant, saddened. Frik knew he couldn't harm Mordred, despite how much he disliked him. That swaying dark frame held as a vase the last of Morgan's blood. Lies She bled from wounds that invariably occur. Far-reaching and painful, Nimue's injuries were pictured in her mind as the tears of blood shed by saints, though she did not dare compare herself to the immaculate. Always, as with the morning, things began with hope but petals quickly withered with doubt and fell as dust in the prevailing light. In such light she was made to recognize the truth for what it was as Merlin set promises as water flowers in the pools surrounding her feet. Each time he departed he left her with promises of his return. Promises he could not - or did not - always keep. If the world did not have to interfere... if only Merlin would let God see to the endings of things rather than attending to them himself... If he could let the anger of his heart calm before vainly seeking revenge for wrongs that could not be remedied... Their lives could be so different if he would step back and let the world go without his guidance. Sealed in a haven of Mab's creation, she imagines Merlin resting in her arms, sleeping peacefully beside her. His face, mouth open, at her neck. His hands at her waist. His gentle touch is that of a husband. No enemy threat or fear for the future to take him from her. Only the sound of his soft breaths in the still dawn, unawakened hands weakly searching for the things he maintains in dreams. She by now should be long accustomed to such sights for she and Merlin had been courting in their hearts since first they met. There had been no other for either of them in all their lifetimes apart, all their seconds together. The memories she recreates should not be as new as they are, so painfully fresh. In her idle thoughts he is bathed in the sun's glow, the heat of summer, and his steps are made over the yielding sand as Avalon's waters recede. An island, a woman left without guard, without the right to give into temptation. Marriage did not unite them in the eyes of God, but, in Merlin's absence, she at times found herself wishing she had acted on impulses as they were presented. As in life she did not sway in dreams as he was beside her again, beads of perspiration on his brow, a smile on his impish face, a mystery behind his half-lidded blue eyes. The eyes she so loved. She sat motionless, listened, spoke with her hands, heart and soul. Spoke with the man across the room, at her side, in her bed. His lips were like currents, his hands stains. His voice a token of his soul. Soft and kind, his voice acted for his hands, reaching the tips of fingers, the moons in her nails. The stars and comets of her lips, teeth, throat, collarbone. He kissed her over and over again. And she closed her eyes, her mind swaying as though she were aboard a ship. Employed were means other than magic to enchant and willingly she fell under his spell. This continued until she woke as he promised again that he would be with her forever. ~oOo~ A/N: Friends and Enemies was written after I found out my dog had cancer.

The first and third were previously published but have been slightly altered. The second was an early draft for Wax and Flame . ~o~ Young Merlin was alone in the midst of a forest, one hidden away behind a door in the Land of Magic. He was knelt above a narrow, winding creek, his hands in the water. \"You're playing when you should be studying,\" Mab whispered from the wind, appearing suddenly from nowhere. Swathed in darkness, she observed him from afar. \"I'm not playing. I am shaping the water. See the stones beneath? The way the water runs over them... I hear something rise from it that is almost like the sound of voices gathered in song.\" \"It is a song,\" Mab said, distantly. \"Though, the voice belonged to my sisters.\" \"It's is so sad,\" Merlin stated, his tone soft. \"The song is about death. You shouldn't expect it to be pleasant.\" \"Whose death?\" \"Ours,\" Mab answered sharply, her chin turning to the air. \"Hers and my own. She has already given up.\" She stood in silence for a moment, in thought, then made herself and Merlin reappear in the schoolroom of the cave. \"She may have given up, but I won't.\" She walked to one of the various towers of books on a neighboring table, selected one and placed it in Merlin's hands. \"Learn.\" The stone walls of Avalon Abbey were cast in unspent light from the moon, a glow as though transferred from Queen Mab's underground realm of magic. Merlin and Nimue walked side by side through the courtyard and winding halls of the holy place, close enough that their shoulders brushed with their steps. Light fell through the corner shadows in beams. There was darkness under the trees, though their leaves and fruit were whitened in the light of a full moon. Nimue's eyes strayed to the dark, to the places she was unable to make out in passing. She was quiet, lost in reverie. She'd heard a noise that made her recall the room she'd slept in as a child, the great trees then that had creaked at night as the wind had taken them. Though it was a mild evening, Merlin's mind went to winter and its palaces. He thought of Uther and the battleground of ice; to the hope he'd had then for the future of England under the reign of a good man, a Christian king. Merlin vividly remembered the sight of rushing armies coming toward him on both sides. The energy that had flooded the area. The moment when all else faded as his eyes met with Vortigern's. The king's body sealed behind a stirious window, a plain of snow stained with the blood of those fallen the frame of his death. He thought of Nimue as he had known her in the mourning of her father Lord Ardent. Merlin had remained in Avalon afterward for as for long as possible to provide Nimue with the comfort he hadn't been given in the wake of Ambrosia's death. At present he'd been in Avalon less than a week, but he did not know all that had transpired in the outside world during his departure. He feared that as he the same as slept in the Abbey, Mab had in his absence struck. He imagined Arthur, where he might be on his quest. Was the boy near ice, was he near sands, the seas... \"I forgot to tell you. I had a dream about your Aunt Ambrosia,\" Nimue disturbed his thoughts. \"Auntie A...\" Nimue turned her face away from his, her eyes revealing a hint of embarrassment, remorse. \"I know it wasn't her as you knew her, but my own picture, the one you've given me over the years. Your stories are always so detailed it makes me feel like I knew her as well.\" Nimue returned his gaze, now smiling warmly. \"She was here with us. She was happy and so proud of you, Merlin.\" He stopped to listen. He took Nimue's hands in his. She closed her eyes with the exchange, accepting his touch, lost until she thought to protectively shield her face. She then added, \"I'm proud of you too, Merlin.\" With her words he leaned forward, touching his head to hers, wishing in some way that what he felt for her would transfer through contact. \"Thank you,\" he whispered. It wasn't enough but but was all he could manage at the moment. Merlin waved a hand over Nimue's hair and shoulders in a half-hearted attempt to help bring her to sleep. The sky was a dark blue, and floating in the air and about their swing-bed were hundreds of tiny gray and brown feathers. \"There is nothing in all the realms that could make me want to leave you,\" Merlin said, his face inches from Nimue's. \"You do not have a choice,\" Nimue replied, the smile not reaching her eyes. \"You will leave with the sun.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You're not supposed to be visiting me, especially not in bed. The sisters would not think it right,\" Nimue said, with a hint of amusement. \"But to my benefit they cannot see you. If they happen on my body, they will only see a figure lost in dreams.\" Merlin did not at first understand, then realized they were both already asleep and that he was visiting her dreams through his own. Nimue nodded, knowing that he grasped their situation. \"You're using magic to see me.\" He sighed. \"It was not my intention, Nimue. While asleep my want to see you apparently exceeds any remaining moral inhibitions.\" Nimue laughed. \"Why apologise? I'm so glad that you're here. I've missed you.\" He stroked her cheek. \"I've missed you, too. You can't know how much.\" Merlin moved to study the feathers in his hand. \"However, it is rather disquieting to discover I am so lacking in control.\" \"But this is only a dream.\" \"Yes, but what might I do in the future? A life could be ruined from a message sent in dreams.\" \"So many dismiss visions, though. You shouldn't worry.\" \"If only it were that simple.\" \"But it is. You visit me. You don't fly to inform others of your plans or see the wicked. Even if they are in your thoughts while conscious, you haven't the time to see them because you go where your heart lies: with me.\" Merlin reached for Nimue's hand and pressed her fingers to his lips, kissing them; wishing he could somehow account for the recently dreamed plumes of smoke bleeding into the laughter of a clinquant Queen. ~o~ ","Summary":" A/N: These were written sometime in 2014.

And that is a useful skill to have, for in her life so many people have lied to her. It starts when she is a little girl. Her father tells her that he loves her. He does not. He is ashamed of his ugly daughter. He tells Morgan that she will be married to a great lord and have a fine castle one day. Morgan likes the idea. But it will never happen – even if she was a beauty, what lord would risk joining his house to Gorlois – a Christian loyalist- while Vortigern is in power? (And when Vortigern is no longer in power, that is the least of her family's problems) – Merlin lies to her. He tells her that anyone can do magic, and for a few minutes of trembling excitement, after her hand comes away from him filled with coin, Morgan sits beside her mother at the coronation feast and tries to cast spells as she hides her hands beneath the table. It doesn't take long for her to realise that there is no magic in her hands at all. She tries for a few days afterwards anyway, as her father rushes them back to Tintagel through the early morning mists, and she sits in the litter with her mother trying to understand why they are running. As they return to their lonely, guarded home, and Morgan tries to find out when their enemies are coming. She gives up after a week or so, and sets her anger at the wizard aside. She doesn't think that he meant to lie. Perhaps it isn't a lie if it's just a misunderstanding? (It is not long afterwards that she discovers that Merlin is capable of deception on a much grander scale than she has ever comprehended before. And oh, then she is angry again, she hates him and his king as much as she has ever hated anyone). – She sees through Uther's disguise, through Merlin's magic. This is the tipping point, the time at which her family comes to ruin. She tries to warn her mother, warn the guards. But she is a child, and none will listen to her. Not until the morning comes, and the guards come running at Igraine's screams. Until Uther saunters out of her chambers. Until a messenger comes riding to the gates with the news that Gorlois lies dead in a nearby ravine. But it is much too late by then. In her dreams she revisits the moment again and again, and each time she takes something sharp – her carving knife, a broken piece of glass – and drives it into Uther's throat, his heart, his stomach, until he falls to the floor and she can take her weapon to his lying face instead. They are a cold comfort. She had not killed him, and now he is out of her reach. (When she learns that he died in madness, plunging a knife into his own chest, Morgan smiles beatifically to herself and thinks that perhaps her dreams did their work in some way). – Igraine had always told Morgan that she loved her. But in the dusk, as Merlin rides away with Uther's baby, the reason that her mother is shamed and her father is dead, Morgan hears that her mother has thrown herself from the top of the castle. She has killed herself for the loss of her son, because her daughter isn't important enough to live for. Morgan cries angry tears, tears up her mother's dresses, climbs up to the top of the tower and shouts out to her mother that she hates her, if there is any part of her that can still hear. Igraine always told Morgan that she loved her. But apparently that was a lie too, and of all the ones Morgan has confronted in her short life so far, it is this one that hurts the most. (Later, when Morgan is a mother herself, she promises Mordred that she will never let him go as her mother did to her. She will fight for him. And she does.) – Mab makes promises. Extravagant ones. And Morgan can tell that they are true – or at least that she believes them to be so. Mab cannot lie, after all. If Morgan were not so distracted by Frik, if she were not so desperate for a family, then perhaps she would have realised that every one of Mab's promises was for Mordred. She never mentioned Morgan at all. (It will occur to Morgan eventually. With the grey skies above and the stone stairs rushing up to meet her. But it will be too late then). – Her son doesn't lie to her. In fact, the more time his Auntie Mab spends at Tintagel, the less he has to say to her at all. He makes it quite clear that she has been supplanted in his affections by the dark fae queen – after all, Morgan can promise him all the crowns and power that he could ever want, but only Mab can give them to him. When he does speak to her, he is a case study in brutal honesty and sarcasm. But Mordred doesn't lie to her. Morgan supposes that is something. – Frik lies to Morgan all the time. The first time they meet, he tells her that he will teach her magic. Morgan is ready for the lie this time, but she plays along anyway – for he offers her a chance to strike against Uther's horrible little spawn. Another time he visits he tells her that he will make her beautiful. She is not in the mood for lies any longer, and she is grieving her mother. She tells him to go away, and for many years he does. By the time he comes back, his promise of beauty and vengeance isn't a lie anymore. He makes new lies to go in their place, but these ones are foolish – amusing tales to make her laugh. Insulting rumours about her enemies. These are obvious lies, she knows they are lies and he knows that she knows. Sometimes she shares some lies of her own, and they drink wine and they laugh, secure in the knowledge that they cannot truly hide from each other. Other lies slip down less well with the wine. Assurances that her childbirth won't be painful (it is), that his employer has any degree of fondness for Morgan (she doesn't), and that her son does love her after all. Yes, he lies to her all the time. But at least these ones are kindly meant. Sometimes she wonders what the two of them would be if they ever paused for a moment in their lies and illusions, and simply confronted each other with honesty. Part of her is worried that he would turn away from her. Another part worries that he has spent so long weaving lies, and she has spent so long living them, that if they stripped those away there would be simply … nothing left. (One day she will have the chance to find out, and it is to her relief that she finds that she is still capable of giving love, of receiving it. At the end of Morgan's unhappy life of lies, she is finally confronted with honest, kind truth. And so, perhaps she will at least die happy).

Honoria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13155641","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I didn't want to cover 'Christmas at Tintagel' but a conversation with my sister led to this. All rules have been thrown aside. Writing at a time I shouldn't be. Please forgive errors. Mordred is supposed to be around 14 or so mentally and in appearance. Removed is a bit a friend suggested bore similarity to a scene in which Dudley Dursley (of Harry Potter fame) received gifts. My sister, who helped, said it was not her intention to borrow from HP. I am so distant from the HP universe I did not realize that it may have seemed as if it was borrowed from the franchise. If I give a nod to something, I try to acknowledge it. Mordred's behavior in my story was based on a) himself and b) a family member who shall remain nameless. ~oOo~ Mordred hurried out of his room without first bothering to change from his sleeping clothes or put on his shoes. He ran through the paths that led to the main hall of Tintagel, his long dark hair flowing behind him, and pushed open the massive double-doors of the grand chamber. He grinned when he discovered the tremendous array of gifts awaiting him. Queen Mab was alone inside the hall, sitting in a sleek curved back chair. Her eyes were glowing as she took in his reaction. A faint smile was on her lips. Beside her was a large Christmas tree alight with candles, a crown residing at its top. Years before, when Mordred had first heard of Christmas, he all but demanded they celebrate it. The religious aspect of the holiday needn't be acknowledged — it was a day to receive gifts! Frik, in Mab's absence, agreed that the general mood of the trio could benefit from the festivities and by magic decorated the interior of Tintagel with garlands, trees, wreaths and all manner of holiday decor, once again having reached into the future. He'd taken special care to place sprigs of mistletoe throughout the castle. The boy did not care for the decor, but tolerated it if it meant he would receive gifts. However, Morgan happily inspected the entire castle, stopping to in awe look at each new thing. She was more a child at heart than her own son. The gnome learned early on that it was an unwise decision to take on the appearance of St. Nicholas or any of his helpers. The experience with Mordred was not one he liked to recall. Mab had been furious when she returned from watching Merlin to find the inhabitants of Tintagel apparently celebrating Christmas. Frik explained that they were not celebrating the birth of Christ, more the excuse for Mordred to be given presents. \"Surely, Madame, once you see young Master Mordred's face, the twinkle in his eye, his smile, you simply won't be able to turn down his request to celebrate the holiday.\" And he'd frustratingly been correct. Mab's fury subsided as soon as she saw Mordred. \"Oh, if it makes you happy,\" she'd said. Now, on a Christmas morning many years later, Mordred was wearing ebony pajamas as he approached his aunt. She was dressed in her usual midnight splendor, all dark blues and black; eyes heavily shadowed. Behind Mordred, Frik and Morgan sleepily entered the hall. He in a periwinkle nightcap with a matching smoking jacket and nightshirt, she in an off-white sleeping gown and a lavender robe. Mordred chuckled, running in spurts, taking in the sight of innumerable gift-wrapped boxes. They were stacked in piles throughout the room. Some of their towers looked as though they might topple over. \"They're all yours, my sweet,\" Mab said from her chair. He had already started unwrapping a gift before Mab finished speaking. When he saw the contents of the first box, he placed it to the side, without even removing the item and began unwrapping another. He was seated on the floor, his legs curled beneath him. Mab observed him intently, leaning forward in her chair, her hands on her knees. She almost appeared deranged her features were so removed from their normal cast. When Mordred reacted with joy upon seeing a gift Mab would laugh with pleasure in her odd, feathery way. It was almost like the hissing of a great lizard. Frik and Morgan watched from where they stood, hearing Mordred frantically tear paper and at times comment on the gifts he'd been given. Soft strange music played from unknown sources in corners. They exchanged gifts, lost in their own world, separate from the others. Frik gave Morgan a necklace which appeared to be made of liquid gold. She offered Frik a ring set with rubies, a family heirloom, but he told her to keep what remained of her family. Her love was more than he could of ever dreamed of. When Mordred finally came to the end of his gifts, he overturned several empty boxes and hurled them across the room. \"Is that it?\" \"Well, it's quality over quantity, Master Mordred,\" Frik offered. Mab, with the blink of her eyes made several gifts appear in a space clear of debris. \"There you are Mordred.\" Without thanks, Mordred began to open the new packages. \"Mowdwed, didn't you get anything fow youw Auntie Mab?\" Morgan asked, fingering her necklace. \"Auntie Mab said my smile was enough. Isn't that right, Auntie?\" \"Yes, Mordred. More than enough.\" \"I suppose it's enough for all of us,\" said Frik, as Mordred hadn't given gifts to anyone. He never did, and Frik shuddered to think what Mordred might hand out if he were a more giving soul. Morgan began to make her way through the piles of torn wrapping paper and toward the Christmas tree. Seeing that she was having some difficulty, Frik with his thought made the papers disappear, one after the other before her feet came in contact with them. \"Send them to the wizard's cottage. Why don't you?\" Mordred suggested. When she reached the tree, Morgan looked to Frik who knew it as a sign to magically make a few gifts appear in the upper branches of the tree. \"I know youw Auntie Mab alweady gave you many gifts, but this is fwom me,\" she bent and placed a gift-wrapped package in his lap. \"And this one is fwom Uncle Fwik.\" She placed it on top of the other and kissed her son's head. \"I love you so much,\" she said. \"I hope you know that.\" \"Yes, mother,\" came Mordred's dutiful reply. Mordred was displeased but not surprised to unwrap a toiletry set and a book on manners and etiquette. His mother was always giving him things she thought might be useful. Never things that might make him happy. His Auntie Mab had given him all the things he truly wanted, traps, knives, instruments of torture, candies, and toy soldiers to demolish, among many other things. He would burn the gifts from his mother and her idiot later. Outside the windows, snow was steadily falling. Mordred's mother returned to the Christmas tree. \"Oh, look thewe's one hewe for Auntie Mab!\" Morgan le Fay smiled and happily waltzed toward Queen Mab, handing her the package. Mordred paused from what he was doing, trying to appear nonchalant as he looked over his shoulder and listened. \"Y-You didn't need to do that,\" Mab hissed, faintly pleased. Her skin glimmered in the fire-light as she reached for the package, her nails making a faint noise as they drummed against the box. \"It's fwom both of us. Fwik and me. I picked it out, though,\" Morgan said, standing near. The light glitter over her eyes was the color of a sunset. Queen Mab carefully tore the paper from the box, knowing she could have used magic to open it. She found inside an iridescent purple vase of carnival glass. Tilting her head, a raven taking in a shining object, she held it to the light for a moment then placed it back in its container, which she lowered to the floor and slid under her chair. \"It's. . . nice.\" It was hard for her to say, and she said it quickly, almost under her breath. \"Now, if everyone is ready, it's time for the feast.\" \"Oh, oh Auntie. Take from my father's table!\" Mordred pleaded, suddenly on his feet. Gravelly sounds left her throat, her eyes narrowed with her grin. \"As you wish, Mordred. What would you like?\" \"I'm in the mood for whatever my father and Merlin are most looking forward to.\" Mab's face betrayed her affection for the boy. Several bowls and platters of food appeared on the table. \"Will they have anything left?\" Frik asked. \"They have plenty,\" Mab said. \"What concern is it of yours?\" \"Merely a question.\" Frik magically changed his, and Morgan's clothes into their day-to-day wear. He left Mordred as he was, afraid of angering the boy. \"Besides,\" Mordred started, taking a seat beside Mab, \"being a good Christian, Arthur should have no reason to complain. It's all going to a worthy cause. Isn't that the sort of thing they believe in? Giving to the bastard children of the world. The sacrifice will make him all the more Christ-like in the eyes of himself and his pet.\" \"I wonder if Master Merlin is enjoying himself?\" \"I hope not, but I'm suwe he is if he's with Awthuw,\" Morgan said before drinking from her goblet of mulled wine. She was at her usual place at the end of the long table, opposite Mab. The two males sat beside their respective Queens. Before them was a wide verity of puddings, meats, potatoes, pies, cakes and sweet yams, along with fruit juices, cider and wine. Candles and vases of flowers were mixed between crockery. \"Did you get all that what you wanted, sweetling?\" Mab wondered aloud, her voice low, almost a purr. She was basking in Mordred's silent adoration. \"Yes, Auntie. I suppose so.\" There was more, always more, but he did not voice his other requests. Far off, in Camelot, Mab could sense Merlin's disappointment in not finding his favorite baked apples filled with cream and honey at this years feast. Nor the mulled wine. For a split second Mab envisioned Merlin sitting beside her, sharing their feast and happiness. Even the insipid Nimue was called forth in her mind. She chose not to let it effect her. She patted Mordred's hand. \"Good. I'm glad. Now eat, my dear. Here,\" she retrieved the plate with the baked apples and placed it before him, \"I know for a fact that these are some of Merlin's favorites. Eat them, my dear, simply because he can't and he wants them.\" \"With pleasure.\" Mordred stabbed an apple and placed it on his plate. \"Have some of the potato cakes too, Mowdwed,\" Morgan suggested, collecting another from the platter. \"Thewe vewy good.\" \"You won't go amiss with the lamb either. Master Arthur really has a most talented kitchen staff.\" Mordred ignored them, selecting roast chicken. \"Did evewyone see the beautiful necklace Fwik gave me? I love it.\" She played with the chain again, lifting it slightly from her neck. \"That's nice, Mother,\" Mordred said only to placate her. ~oOo~ ","Summary":" A/N: I didn't want to cover 'Christmas at Tintagel' but a conversation with my sister led to this.

Honoria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13143926","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: The James Mallory novelizations mention in passing a forest of crystals within the Land of Magic. The author may have been using a metaphor but I am taking his description literally. Please forgive run-on sentences (the opening is the worst) and other errors. Try as I might my mind will not cooperate in seeking a path towards redemption. Forgiveness is asked in regard to the plausibility of this story as well. The dress I imagine Morgan wearing is reminiscent of styles worn by the subjects of Alphonse Mucha paintings. ~oOo~ A row of torches mounted at intervals along a wall cast golden light upon the bare limbs of Morgan le Fay. She leaned forward and carefully laid a tarot card among its kin in a spread on the floor. Hesitating, she deciphered the meaning of the card concealed by lengthening shadows, then placed another card from the deck beside it. Discovering the outcome, she paused again, unhappy with the results. Frik was seated beside Morgan in the empty hall, casually eating from a wooden bowl of dried nuts and fruits. In his lap with its cover open was a substantial book, Fairy Stories , to which he was adding another chapter. He was comfortable enough in his relationship with Morgan to risk wearing a feathered cap as he played the role of a wordsmith. \"Something amiss, my dear?\" Frik asked, glancing up from the page. He was getting to a particularly unlikable year in history and welcomed a reprieve. Morgan sighed, placing the deck in a drawstring pouch by her feet. She was listless, not having ventured from the castle for a considerable amount of time. The air was to her stifling. \"The cawds keep telling me stwange things about my son. I don't want to wead them anymowe.\" Frik had a few things to say about Mordred as well but tactfully kept his thoughts to himself. \"Best not to pay them any heed.\" \"But I thought they didn't lie?\" \"Well, they're open to interpretation.\" He closed his book, removed his cap and crossed his legs, leaning back. Morgan silently looked to the opposite wall, filled with a sense of unease. \"If another person selected the same cards they more than likely would derive a different conclusion based on their own personal experiences.\" \"Where is it you go when you leave me, you and Mab?\" The question surprised Frik by its randomness. He paused. \"Why, we usually return to Mab's realm, The Land of Magic. You know that.\" \"What's it like?\" Though she had heard of it before, Morgan felt like hearing about it again. Imagining the realm was an escape from the tedium of seclusion. \"Oh, you'd like it there, Morgan. I find that Madame has the most wonderful taste when it comes to furnishings. Every room is exquisitely decorated. Crystals all over the place. Only the best...\" His hands moved animatedly, index finger and thumb maintaining their hold on a dried apricot. \"This place, is it whewe Mab will take my son?\" She gently pulled at the hem of her dress and stole an almond. \"In time... yes, I believe she will send Master Mordred to her realm.\" \"And you live thewe?\" Morgan asked, aware that he was humoring her by retelling information. She envisioned herself in a room the same shade as violets, golden-blue rays of mellow light swaying on the walls as they reflected from an obscure pool. The air was light and she seemed to have chalk on her hands. \"Oh yes, along with all manner of magical beings. The place is practically overrun. You know, it's where I helped Master Merlin learn magic. I was his teacher. . . He was at times a most difficult student. But then, I suppose he is a most difficult person altogether.\" Her jaw clinched with resentment as Frik relayed that Merlin had formerly lived in the Land of Magic. She hadn't forgotten that the wizard refused to use his talents, purposely abstaining from using the magic she would put to constant use. \"What do you do thewe now?\" \"Oh many, many things. I'm constantly on my feet. Madame always has something that needs seeing to, and of course I'm the one who sees to it.\" He sighed. \"Will you take me thewe?\" Frik blinked rapidly, the wistful smile faded from his face. \"Morgan, I don-\" \"Oh Fwik, please,\" Morgan pleaded as she moved closer to him, stroking his shoulders, arms and finally his neck and jawline. Her brown eyes glistened in the dull light. \"I want to see whewe my son will leawn how to defeat Awthuw and become king... I am his mothew after all.\" He cleared his throat. \"I-I suppose it wouldn't hurt... Just for a moment or two. Madame is quite busy with Master Mordred even as we speak... We'll be there and back before she even notices we're missing.\" If Morgan had looked at Frik's face, she would have seen that it was contorted in misery. Who am I kidding? he mouthed without benefit of an audience. Frik thought the practice of magic might perhaps raise his spirits. Valiantly he rose and seized one of Morgan's hands, spinning her in a slow pirouette as her costume was by enchantment transformed. Once finished, he performed another feat of magic to summon a looking-glass. Morgan promptly took the mirror from him and held it before her face, straining to observe her reflection in the ill-lit hall. Frik clapped his hands and the light from the surrounding torches grew in intensity. Morgan's reflection yielded her svelte frame clad in a crushed velvet dress, mustard-yellow and sleeveless. At one shoulder were pinned two velvet roses, pink and red. Her eyes were shadowed and her lips dark. Her beauty was unparalleled by even the twilit sky and its pearls of constellations. \"Whewe ever did this gown come from? I've not seen one like it before.\" \"It is a gown from another time, my love. But they won't mind you borrowing it, certainly not if they could see you. You're beautiful.\" In the breathless silence of the room she found that she agreed. \"Ready?\" he asked. \"Weady,\" she answered, her eyes meeting his as she clasped his hand. In an instant they were on the stone steps outside Mab's palace. Morgan was transfixed by the enormity of the cave, and, in a state of profound amazement, she had difficulty deciding in which direction she should look. There was much to see wherever her gaze happened to fall, wonders she had before only dreamed of or imagined. Above her, floating serenely on the cool air, were dozens of faeries. Some were faithfully delivering precious stones or crystals to unknown destinations, others were in congregations flying empty-handed on errands. Their pale fluttering wings were a blur. Along the stalagmites were small dwellings whose windows were alight. Housing for the fae, Morgan guessed. At the base of the rockface supporting Mab's grand palace was a stream framed on each side by stone, suspended as though a bridge. Morgan was tempted to place a hand in the water. It was so inviting. Silvery and pure. There was magic in the air; it was thick, akin to electricity. She inhaled the crisp, cleanness of it. There was an underlying scent of rain wettened stones mixed with a perfume she couldn't place; wonderful, exotic and intoxicating. She found herself instantly enamored with the land. Giddy, she turned to Frik only to find that he was attentively studying her reaction. Though he had maintained the features of a swashbuckler, he had by some circumstance changed into the black ink-spotted jacket and uniform he typically wore while in service of the Queen. His thick fingers were intertwined. Upon seeing her glowing face grow puzzled, Frik with his hands searched his body and face to discover he had reverted into the garb of a gnome. Flummoxed, he quickly and by magic changed back into his favored costume, the one that was in its creation immersed in rose water; the flared white shirt and close-fitting navy trousers. Morgan rather favored his other outfit as well, she thought black was a good color on him, but she didn't bother telling him. She was of the opinion that Frik was handsome irregardless of his manner of dress. He already knew that. She stood reverently in place, twisting velvet fabric between her fingers as she looked above to the cave ceiling, the faeries and glittering crystals. Some of the faeries took notice of Morgan's appearance and began to encircle her. A few eagerly took into their hands the ends of her curls and gently pulled on them, watching as they sprang back to her crown with release. One promptly stole from her abundant hair a strand of ribbon which led to the successive theft of hairpins, ribbons and beads by other awaiting fae, each eager to claim their own reward. \"Off with you! Shoo!\" Frik attempted to drive them away. He brandished a folding fan and began to employ it, sending weak currents of air toward the fae. In defiance, a faerie flew directly before Morgan's face and landed in her palm. It gifted her with a polished black pearl before it departed. Morgan smiled, enchanted. \"Thank you,\" she said somewhat awkwardly as it flew away. \"I wouldn't bother talking to any of them. All you'll hear is nonsense.\" Her arms fell to her sides, her feet hastefully in a circle retraced her steps as she groaned like a petulant child. \"Oh couldn't you have just made them stop? Did they welly have to go away?\" \"If I hadn't sent them away, they never would have left you alone, my dear. More would have arrived and exhibited the same behavior. . . Now come, let us embark on our tour. We mustn't tarry here.\" Morgan and Frik visited several areas within the palace, including the schoolroom, Frik's chambers, and many other places significant in terms of their historical and magical value. Morgan did not always make her feelings known as she glimpsed areas of great beauty and wonder, but she enjoyed herself nevertheless. In the fullness of time, at her behest, Frik transported Morgan to a room within the cave which kept behind its door a massive forest which consisted of hundreds of crystals shaped as trees. Ghostly and glowing, they sprouted from a seemingly endless mass of granite, their roots partially exposed. Covering their bases was a fine glittering powder made up of ground gems and crystals expelled of magic. By enchantment the cave ceiling was the skyline of a winter evening. Impenetrable clouds were backlit and of a gray-orange color and stretched onward as far as the eye could see. The distinct chill in the perfumed air matched the illusion of winter. With reverence Morgan stepped inside. Though it was beautiful and brightly lit, there was an eerie cast to the area, a feeling which seemed to whisper of loss and secrets. Frik followed her, glancing cautiously to the empty shadows. Morgan approached a tree and gently placed a hand on its cool trunk. As the prevailing wind passed through the area, she could hear crystal branches ring out overhead as they came in contact with the limbs of other trees. The sound was calming and akin to glass chimes. She stepped forward, under their domed boughs. Frik faithfully kept in step, his hands behind his back. \"I sincerely doubt Master Mordred will have reason to set foot in here, but I suppose there's no telling where his training might send him.\" \"Mowdwed should see this fow himself. I cewtainly won't be able to explain it to him pwopelly. No one could.\" As she spoke, she realized her breath was visible. A cloak quickly wove itself around Morgan's body. \"Oh, thank you. How faw does the forest go?\" \"I'm not quite sure. I've never explored it in full.\" \"Fwom hewe it looks like it nevew ends. It goes on and on fowevea. I'm going to see. . .\" She began to run as fast and as far as her feet and lungs could take her, laughing as Frik tried to keep up. The air was frigid on her face, her eyes watered, but she continued until she could no longer withstand the discomfort of her normally inactive body. Stopping, Frik magically appeared in front of her, and she fell with him to the ground. She laughed when she was able to find her breath. His laughter followed as they realized themselves and straightened, to lie on their backs and look upwards. Viewing the crystal trees and heavens from the ground was both breathtaking and disorienting. Neither sight was of the world Morgan knew. The branches seemed to bend and swell before her in the clouded sky. The wind increased, and on it the sound of shifting glass was sent to other areas as well. She closed her eyes and felt herself seem to fall through the stone on which she was resting, starting from the base of her skull, the considerable weight behind her eyes. Frik thoughtfully looked to the distance. \"I could almost swear I sometimes used to hear birds in here... I wonder... but that's all been so long ago...\" Morgan's eyes remained closed. \"Isn't that one now?\" She propped herself up on her elbows, finding pain in her bones, then, with Frik's aid, hesitantly came to stand on her feet. \"I thought I heawd a biwd in flight...\" A sudden flash of lightning lit the cavernous room as Queen Mab entered the room. She arrived in the near distance, beside the trees, then instantaneously came to stand beside them. In the divine illumination of the forest, she radiated a blackened mist. Her pale skin glistered, her raven hair was made of the threads of night. Her fine array was of a shade of blue so dark it appeared black. \"A faerie informed me of the presence of a visitor in my realm. Frik, what is she doing here?!\" Her fists were clenched as she loomed before them. Her flowing cape was damp with sea mist. In truth Mab had known of their visit from the moment they set foot on her land but she'd been otherwise engaged. As time did not pass in the realm, they'd the same as been gone for only a matter of seconds. Frik fidgeted with his fingers. He did not make eye-contact. \"W-well, Madame, Morgan wanted to see your realm, a-and, as you have been known to bring mortal lovers to the Land of Magic, even if briefly - some, why, some were here for seven years, if not more... I thought, or rather, I hoped -\" \"But they were my lovers, Frik! I realize the experience of having and actually maintaining a lover is new for you, but you mustn't assume you have the same rights as I do! This is my realm. I'm its Queen. You are in my employment.\" \"A fact that has not escaped my notice, Madame. But permit me if you will to speak. Would it not aid your cause to allow some mortals to behold firsthand the glory of your power rather than hide it away? To enable them to see the majesty of the Old Ways? And... well, Madame, Morgan is the mother of the future King of England. It feels as though we owe her something.\" \"Youw palace is vewy beautiful, Mab. I've enjoyed seeing whewe my son will one day visit,\" Morgan added, without fear. Queen Mab regarded the pair with profound distaste. Her shrewd eyes were alight with fury. In one hand she held a crystal, and shining as though he were trapped within, Morgan could see her son in miniature contentedly sleeping in his room. \"Go! Leave now. I will not suffer fools gladly.\" Morgan and Frik quickly disappeared. Before they reappeared in the main hall of Tintagel Castle, Mab's voice could be heard in their minds, severe and threatening, warning them to not make the same mistake twice. Frik had seen firsthand what could happen to a person guilty of much less. He and Morgan were fortunate to have escaped unscathed. Mab must have had more pressing matters on her mind to have not acted on her anger. The pair gradually made their way through the main hall and out, to paths leading to other rooms in the castle. No time had passed in the mortal world. It was still night and the castle remained lit by torches. A Roman style gown clung to Morgan's frame as she slowly made her way toward a table and its two chairs, the magic of her previous dress having worn off. Feeling very tired, she ungracefully threw herself in a chair. Frik claimed its opposite. A platter materialized on the table containing various meats, breads and cheeses. A bottle of mead and two glasses also appeared, along with Morgan's worn Tarot deck. \"Why don't you try reading my cards, Morgan, if you're up to it? At the moment I'm feeling anything but secure.\" \"Alwight.\" Morgan sighed. She straightened from her slouching position, tore off the end from a loaf of bread and pushed it into her mouth. Her thoughts were still with The Land of Magic as she began to shuffle cards. \"I can't undewstand why Mab insists on staying here in Tintagel evewy day when we could all stay in The Land of Magic for a little while at least. Wouldn't it make sense for Mowdwed to stawt twaining now instead of waiting until Awthuw wetuwns?\" She shook her head and reached for more bread and some cheese.\"It simply can't compwehend it. What do we achieve hewe that can't be achieved thewe?\" Frik's gaze darted to the neighbouring room, the air. His hands were raised as if to urge Morgan to stop speaking lest Mab should hear. \"Madame works in mysterious ways.\" \"Thewe isn't neawly so much to do hewe, though. In fact, thewe's hawdly anything to do once you've alweady done it ten, twelve or a hundwed times!\" Her nimble fingers ceased their movement, having set out the desired number of cards for her spread. Though distracted, she surveyed their faces. \"Well, my dear, there are some things that I never tire of, no matter what. You being chief among them.\" She was slow to catch his words, still focused. Her initial reply was a brief laugh that remained low and humming in the tower of her throat. She crossed her arms on the table, over the cards, and smiled as she looked at him. \"Nevew?\" \"No, not ever. Not with you.\" He placed a hand over hers. \"I'm sorry you weren't able to see more of The Land of Magic.\" \"Oh Fwik, don't be. I loved what I saw and am happy we went. I feel fowtunate to have been thewe.\" \"I think, all things considered, Morgan, you and I are both exceptionally fortunate.\" ~oOo~ ","Summary":" A/N: The James Mallory novelizations mention in passing a forest of crystals within the Land of Mag"},{"Movie":"Romantics","Title":"Love Twist","Author":"Sham Kumar Monger","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13073676","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"HELLO DAWA\" GREETED PENJOR, AN ENERGETIC BOY who wakes up first than anyone else. \"Yes Penjor, any thing else?\" I responded still yawning because of the nightly hours. Usually at night, fooling the Warden and the Night Guards, no place for the Captains, we enter through the pearly gates of our 'Divine House of the Heaven' for the mundane activity. Let me say it naive and simple, we usually blow the smokes or sometimes, teachers say feeding on the grasses. Mary Jane is the usual mandatory one and seldom psychoactive drugs like LSD and DMT. After that, we feel divinely euphoria and even the stars seem twinkling in the dark obnubilated night. Laughter is another feature, we laugh like mentals and think like an ass. Study is another fucking stuff , my teachers keep on advising me that I have to burn my midnight candle and often say I am performing very poorly. Parents and teachers exhortations make me hurl, I am fade up of behearing. My ears seemed operating very poorly due to pressurised advice. One day it so happened that I was referred to the school counselor, a real chump. He questioned me which I don't wanted to disclose, I simply said, \"I am not able to perform well as wished and awaited for because my brain is fucking poor.\" When I used a word 'fucking' in the conversation, as in the Bhutanese context it is understood as filthy and inappropriate, he was exasperated and whanged his broad hand on my face as he considered the talk to be official. I said , \"I am a follower of Gandhi\", so I willingly gave my left. He was extremely fierce then, so he forced me out of counselling service room. \"Let us go fast to the school. Today is Chemistry test, you know that?\" He asked, sashing for the final round around his waist. Chemistry? Stoichiometry, Mole Concept and Gas Laws? All are the toughest chapters. \"Chemistry? When is the period?\" I interrogated him solemnly and somberly for sake I cannot conjecture chemistry teacher, a real sorcerer. He roughs out without having mercy. I still reminisce how badly he had beaten the stuffing out of me when I couldn't state the Gay-Lussac Law. I still have contusions to prove. \"It's second period, you heard me?\" He said earnestly. \"Then, what is the first period?\" I asked him, totally psyched and brought into life. \"Haha...why do you ask that?\"He asked rather mortifyingly. \"If it's free, I can get time to study.\" I mused, finding myself oblivious of what is really happening around. \"Haha...unfortunately, it's Mathematics, dude!\" He said simply. He might have studied thoroughly looking at his pride. \"Ooops! Bad luck, Dawa?\" I whispered to myself, unheard by others; mused to the land of unknown dilemma. \"What did you say?\"He asked, smelled the rat. \"Nah...\" I responded dully. Maths teacher, another nutcase if it's in Japan, arrives before time and never leaves the period free. Swotting up on maths is like sweeping the awful lavatory with rich in pungency which takes to the bed for weeks. The best mark that I ever hatched in my so far attended Mathematics exams was forty-five out of hundred, it sounds funny! \"Penjor, then show me your answers during test.\" I pleaded, melancholia indeed burnt my root of hopes and strength through. \"May be, if situation permits.\" He replied with theatrical smile. Before I could get dressed, he left the room and other mates too. I was the tail end hippo to go to school with morning blessing from the warden. It took me almost fifteen minutes to reach, almost behind time by twenty-five minutes for the study. I was seriously dealt by the TOD , you know what? Classmates made me a play of fun and animadversion when they saw imprints on both sides of my coarse face. I was embarrassed. I opened the Chemistry Text Book and tried to scan and if possible mock up. But, my efforts were dissipated, no single definition entered my brain. I repeated again but my exertion had no positive impact. It rather caused cephalalgia, so I just turned my blind eyes on it and went for sleeping. \"Why are you sleeping Dawa? Today we have Chemistry test, you know that right? At least read and turn over a new leaf, my poor chap.\" Yethro woke me up. She oftentimes provides me flowery smiles and advises me not to take drugs. I too like her said that not too madly though the fact is that she is the most beautiful angel in our institution. Every boy follows her! She is medium sized, with shoulder length reddish hair, white complexion and has loveable body physique; a callipygous! She looks more beautiful when dressed in her favourite attires. \"Haha...really? My angel?\" I teased her. \"Haha...you keep on praising me, Master Druggist! You will score zero later. I know you like me but...\" She said incompletely that led to the suspense of my heart. \"But...?\" I asked her back, heated up. \"But...you will know as time passes by.\" She replied with different impression. I found myself dumped and in the climax of her say. I was too shivering with excitement and I could feel the increased heart beat and my mouth was dry. \"Haha...don't vex much. I meant you will again get the dog beating like what you get oftentimes.\" She switched the topic and teased me but I felt teetotally different. I kept on gazing at her face that looks brighter than the moon , which is taken into account the most beautiful in the entirety and gasped at her way of laughing. Those cute and pearly eyes that resembled the twinkling stars, those snowy face, the way of laughing, the way she wiggles her waist while walking... \"What happened? \" She prodded and woke me from my reverie. \"Nah...nothing. Nothing!\" I revived my consciousness, a reality. Our conversation was cut in by a bell. Hostel life is all about bell, we wakeup, bell; we study, bell; we eat, bell; we work, bell; we sleep, bell...and what not to bring in? \"OK, you keep on sleeping, a bone-idle pig!\" She taunted me so pleasingly. \"Tee hee...\" She went for breakfast and I too followed her in the kitchen. There were queues of students waiting for the meals or comestibles to be served. \"Class tens, you're last today.\" Announced the school boys captain. \"What the hell? Class ten last?\" I growled in dismay. \"Yeah, why not?\" Thinley, a Jewa House Captain as well as COD of the day, replied shrugging his shoulders. \"Really a fucking day!\" I muttered angrily. Serving the meals last is directly proportional to no time to study. I was intensely tensed. 'Chemistry, chemistry, chemistry...let it study by the chemists, why we?' It resonated and echoed to and fro on the circular wall of my unproductive brain. I compelled myself into the tight buzzing procession. Those sounds of falling plates and mugs on the ground are really choleric and disgusting. \"Hey dog? Why you in the front? We have been waiting for long, our legs are paining...Go back to your own place!\" A black-naked crane by appearance, affronted publicly and forced me out from the line. \"Please brother, we have Chemistry test today. I haven't study, let me go.\" I pleaded though I was internally burnt with his pride. \"No...we too have mathematics test today, you got me?\" He grunted like a pig, no condolence in the least. I, like an under dog, went putting my head between my two skinny shoulders. I was at the tail end. I missed my earlier place. Eventually, after a long wait, my turn rolled. I received my share. It was fried rice mingled with raw cabbage. I ate speedily but unfortunately, a lump of bolus stopped its acceleration at my vocal cord. I hicoughed, water seemed to force itself from inside and came out of my nose mingled with alimentary mucus forming viscous homologous mixture. Luckily, Yethro saw a fuss going on me and she brought water and made me to drink. She hit on my slimy neck to make the bolus flow in. Everyone concentrated at us. I was extremely ashamed. Yethro, a Lucifer in comparison, took me to the classroom. I felt ever so ashamed as everyone watched us going to the class. I trembled with fear as illicit relationship was strongly proscribed by the school and if the administrators see us, by misfortune, I would be mercilessly chastised though in actuality we weren't. She seemed to be bold enough to catch hold of my arm, which is shivering, after all. \"Aren't you feeling anything?\" I asked her, shivering like in the cold as mine legs were emasculated. \"Why? What are you talking about? Which stuff are you referring to?\" She inquired raising the firmness in her tone piercing her pearly eyes on mine. \"Nah...nothing. Nothing at all! Just asking for a sake. \" I replied forcing a fake smile, still quivering. We ascended the lengthy steps to our classroom. Finally, I reposed under the spinning fan at a celerity of level five. I could feel the cool sweat on my body. She looked at me differently. I felt uneasiness. \"Why are you looking so differently at me today which you never did before?\" I enquired her uncomfortably. \"Nothing special, just felt like looking at you.\" She said and continued , \"Can you imagine how you would have looked like when a stuff stopped at your Adam's Apple? Haha\" She taunted me, masking her merrily laughing mouth with her snowy and nesh palm. \"I don't know. You are the one to witness, so you should know better than me, isn't it?.\" I replied sternly. \"Tee hee!\" She just laughed and I kept on looking at the happiness her facial expression revealed. Her way of laughing is teetotally different that nobody has and had. I have never seen any. Ever. With some elapsed of time, assembly came into existence. I was just standing in the line and trying very hard to recollect those RAM, GMM, Dalton's Law, Partial Pressure, Ideal Gas Law, Finding the Empirical/Molecular Formula, Percentage Composition,...but nothing seemed to favour me. I was pathetic. I just looked at the lofty pine and homely oak trees where various birds sing sang with their melodious voice and looked at how they fly in utter freedom, after countless attempts to recollect but in no avail. Yethro was earnestly looking at me from her line, perhaps seeing my pathetic condition. I smiled and she too did but obviously theatrical because her mien spoke more than that. After the demise of Assembly, first period started. I went piercing through the hissing and buzzing disorganised lines of the students. It was a good irony that despite the door being too small to support those many students but they were piercing themselves into, though they knew its carrying capacity to allow them to enter, some even hurting their arms or heads. Before I reached the classroom, Mr. Govinda Karariya, M. Phil., M. Sc., B. Ed., our Mathematics Teacher was teaching on 'Precision and Accuracy'. \"Sir, may I come in?\" I asked for. \"Oh! Where were you?\" He inquired rather flat. \"I am just coming from the assembly.\" I replied, stunned and scratching my porcupine-like head as always--as I was inured of doing unwittingly. \"Till now? Oh my goodness! Come in and listen this is the last chance being given to you and the class. I don't want to see such thing again.\" He warned, seemed I did his head in. But he too was mingling with such an itsy bitsy fuss, a minute late or less. \"OK sir!\" Buzzed the class. He taught numerous ways of reading the significant figures abbreviated as SFs and taught the ways to take into consideration. \"Dawa? How many significant figures does this number has?\" He asked me writing the integer '2000' on the green board. \"It has four.\" I responded, the class burst into laughter and I was embarrassed. 'What! What the hell you are talking about?\" He boomed into flame and rage. \"How dare you say? Can you prove it to the class?\" He questioned me harshly. \"It's simple. I just counted all the numbers.\" I replied forcing myself to make presentable. \"What the hell is this son of a bitch?\" He slammed the door and retired. I heard someone murmuring, 'only one' but unfortunately, before I could correct my boo-boo he went out of the classroom. \"Your Chemistry Teacher asked you to come in the MP Hall.\" Said one of the junior boys. All the classmates were rushing towards the hall and some even deceiving by saving the formulae in the calculator while some writing the definitions and important notes illegibly on the back cover of their supporting books that they use to support their answer sheet amidst the coarse surface of the tables. I was blank and so the gloomy was Yethro's face. I didn't know why? We twain too ran in the hall. Subject teacher was meting the question papers and the sheets, when we entered the hall. I too took the papers and searched for Penjor but he was too far in the corner and the nearby seats were already reserved by the mates. No option left, I had to sit next to the subject teacher. All the questions seemed strange like an alien for me. I was ineffectual so my brain was a blank page. To be honest, I could only answer the unit of pressure and state the Boyle's Law that is worth of three marks; 1 for the unit and 2 for stating the law. I could vividly appraise that I scored 3 out of 20 marks. My body lurched time and again when I came to normalcy from the reverie of teacher again beating me to a pulp like making a traditional 'desho' from the bark of 'daphne' tree. \"Dawa! Where are you? Did you finish answering the questions?\" Chemistry Teacher hollered. I was awakened completely from the unconsciousness and nodded my head to signal I didn't. \"Write fast, there is no enough time.\" He replied. How much I exerted to write still and all my attempt was next to nothing. No solution left than carbon copying the questions on the answer sheets. So I sighed one deep breath of relief and went out of the hall. \"Hey Dawa! How was your test?\" Penjor asked smilingly. \"You know it very well. No better than the former.\" I replied and without the mood of having further conversation I went to the class. Most of the student faces showed how well they had attempted the questions, so I, too, once again sighed as I was not only the one. The next day was scheduled for giving our papers. I was totally lost and couldn't stop from hallucinating. The Chemistry teacher came and all the students stood up to greet him. I too tried hard to stand up but I felt my spine and my skeletal systems are turned to a rubber. I was emasculated and melted through by the thought of apprehension. \"How did you do in your test?\" He asked the class providing a greeting smile. I couldn't dare to look at the cane stick he was carrying with him. I could construct a perfect scene about his beating in mine cow-dung brain; applying all his effort on the stick and whooshing so hard at my skinny caboose. \"Ah!\" I outcried unknowingly. ''What happened Dawa? Are you OK?\" He asked me. \"Umm...Nothing sir. Well...I am...uh...okay\" I replied stuttering the sentence. \"OK then\" He said and continued, \" I'm not really impressed with your test.\" Everyone was looking at each other's face as if lost somewhere. \"Some have done good and maximum of you have done very badly.\" He said flipping the answer sheets and continued, \"Let me start from the good ones. Those who got below ten will get the beating according to the mark you scored\" Then he started calling out the names. \"Som Nath scored 18, Penjor 15, Dendup 14.5,...Karma Cheki 10.5 , Tshering 10 , Bhim 9...and so on.\" Bhim was the first to get the taste of cane stick and trailed by others. Everyone was called including Yethro who scored 8.5 and she looked so gloomy and yes my name was not called out. I started to grew skeptical about my own mark. \"Who didn't get your paper?\" He asked, affrontingly. I, with all the energies stored for me, raised my hand and responded, \" I didn't\" Then he asked, \"How did you do your test?\" I couldn't answer to his question and remained stuttering. ''Come here Dawa!\"He asked in a consoling manner. I neared him, unable to pace further and not able to support myself, shivering. I couldn't directly look at him and just bent my head like a branch of a tree unable to withstand the charge of its fruits. \"Haha...\"He started to laugh looking at my answer sheet and remarked, \" Class, he is very intelligent boy. I am really proud of his shrewdness. Haha...he just carbon copied the questions in the answer sheet, that's pretty good. He scored one out of twenty for writing the unit of pressure. \" He said, still unable to control his fucking laughter. Then the beating started. I couldn't withstood his strength applied in his cane stick. I got five sticks on my butt and I am sure I was passed out.[Chapter 2] THE DAY WAS GOOD AND WARM AND friendly especially to the people like me with infinitely poor physical resistance. I felt fresh and excitement filled my vacuum brain, but didn't know why? Maybe because the day is going to be special or maybe not. It was just few days staying as a dayscholar as I couldn't fully endorse the hostel life, especially waking up on time. I, with hardship, completed my boarding for past two years and we the four naughty guys unilaterally came to the decision of staying as a dayscholar. I woke up abruptly when alarm clock, a brand Titan watch, shows slap bang 6:30 a.m. I was really enervated tossing and turning after the prolong BS chats on Facebook the antecedent day. What a bloody hell is this media, really addicted. As long as I could reminisce, it was around 2:00 A.M. that I borne on playing, but thank God I still have some more minutes. I kicked the mattress and leaped out of it. I entered the bathroom and washed my body with dettol soap. And did the morning household chores speedily. The morning was so marvellous with a dazzling sun striking the adorable planet. I could glance the forest thickly enveloped with ever-green trees enjoying the warm company of the luminous sun and the variety of creatures, too; a heaven of diversity. What is more, fleshy lush leaves that dance under influence of gentle breeze flavours the beauty of the pre spring days. Despite I was a bit late, it was one of the splendid days I ever came about to enjoy. \"Mom...is my breakfast ready?\"I said idly. \"Yeah, already. I think now it has been cooled as well. You lazy fellow, come fast.\" She replied courteously, mother love is eternal--never ending and the greatest of all. I breakfasted my meal speedily; wore my gown; perfumed with civet; bid adieu my parents and wearing a jolly mask on mine face left for the school. I had almost travelled half-an-hour when I realized it was the 37th Birth Anniversary of our beloved Fifth Dragon King, usually pronounced as a Druk Ngada Gyalpo. Bloody hell! I again turned back home to get some notes for the day. I forth put to make it a memorable celebration. \"Dawa...are you mad today. Why are you again? It's late.\" Asked my dad who was milking the cow. \"Ah! I forgot to take some notes because I had kept my words to my friends that I would make today a memorable day.\" I replied. After that I headed home which took me nearly a minute or two. \"Dawa...why you again...?\" Inquired my mom who was feeding the piglets. \"To take some notes.\" I replied. \"Are you making use of the money judiciously?\" She inquired rather economically. \"Yes Ama...today is my turn to give treat to my friends.\" I replied putting them in the last part of my laptop-bag. \"OK son, as you wish but don't waste it lavishly and fly it in not allowed spheres.\" She advised caringly as I am ae son of my parents, washing the dishes. \"Tub Ama...I won't spend it in not-to-lavish area and carelessly.\" I responded adjusting the bag at my back. \"Tub tub, I fully trust you.\" She said smilingly, another wonders of mother's love. I again headed towards school with my three naughty friends. It wasn't a long stay in the school as we just joined about six to seven days before and I was feeling so enraptured to meet mine adorable accomplices and some naughty, too, after a quite long vacation. The day was chilly as winter has never broken up. The day usually went off with mundane Socially Useful Productive Work [SUPW, which is hell for the students, especially ours] Every student was busy in their own world, blabbing and chit-chatting uselessly with their friends like they have eternal things to be shared with them and no exception for me, too. Maximum of the students were supervising, well few were sincere enough to work; funny environment! The radiance of enjoyment suddenly set when VP, Student Affairs, interrupted the fascinating chat and compelled me to pick up the waste( dairy chocolate's wrappers) that had been thrown up in front of me by Arjun, a senior studying in IT, who is no younger than my papa by comeliness. Fucking hell! Did I throw and mess that? Do I need to pick up the waste during such occasion? Were I a slave? Nevertheless, my will power was so dim that couldn't boosted my self-esteem but it rather made me unconscious, so I reluctantly and, moreover, out of restraint picked the waste. I was greatly debased by the moron in front of such gorgeous fairies. I really and firmly wanted to curse him; deliberately. Though my temper ran high to the acme due to the action of bloody hell but it wasn't to last for a long. Eventually, I was cooled down by the physiological process going on inside my body, especially the categorized hormone types known as the parasympathetic. I have completely driven away the wrath and ire when I was waiting patiently in the courtyard for usual National Anthem--the moment to pay homage to our farsighted leaders and way to pray for country's prosperity cum pronouncements. After National Anthem, we're pronounced and oriented about the day celebration which is, after all, nationwide celebration. We were asked to be seated on the chairs that have had been arranged the day before, 22nd February. They're arranged in a U-shape so that the performers will be presenting anything in the core and I was excited with burning curiosity that I would be seeing every figure, especially girls'. Wow! The arrangement for teachers were made so special in the front with adorned camp, especially like what is seen during official party(governmental or dignitaries), farewells and spiritual ritual and comfortable chairs(arm chair). The program kicked off at slap bang 9:00 a.m. The atmosphere encircling us seems giggling or to the extent of laughing uncontrollably with pleasure in its heart and soul at the embellishment for the celebration. It is a coloured celebration, indeed. Firstly, as common to the Bhutanese tradition, the vital ceremony commenced with 'Martshang' followed by butter lamp offering as to plead the deities and to mark out the celebration peacefully without any hindrances. Initially Principal offered butter lamp followed by other teachers in fealty to their seniority which denotes the ultimate deference for the senior and to reveal the truth, it's what enshrined in the Social Etiquette of the Bhutanese Society(Driglam Namzha). No Junior can reap the privilege to do things if the senior hadn't done first. This transinic tradition is being strengthened and consolidated thru numerous centuries since first Bhutanese Civilization. A typical example could be noted, when the family members sit for meals, firstly, meals will be offered or served to grandpa if befitted, and grandma, dad, so on. Then only followed by the junior in accordance to seniority, again. From my side, I too wished a good luck for the day though students were not given the opportunity to light the butter lamp as it consumes more time as we're more than a thousand students, just imagine. Followed by butter lamp ceremony, the unique celebration went off with the well come speech by the Principal where we're seated patiently. I believe he seems to have and know everything of everything! The most invaluable piece of advice that I inherited or the to-be takeaway message from him is, \" To be a successful person in the future, you should start from school itself. This is the ideal place and you should take advantage of this. Teachers cannot run after you, you have to run after them which seems incredibly lacking in this institution. My dear boys and girls, live the present to be present in the future!\" After a well-delivered well come speech by a highly-honored Principal, the casual activities took in charge of the time. \"Our celebration will commence, as a welcome dance, with Bhutanese traditional dance so-called 'Zhungdra' which seems not impressive for the youngsters of the present by School Cultural Club members(SCC) and some class ten's students. We're doing this in order to preserve and prosper its uniqueness.\" Announced the anchor, the school counsellor; a young gentle man, with the bated breath. Zhungdra, the national song of Bhutan, has many legendary tales to tell. It's authentic origin seems complicated and sophisticated, which I too is bemused and don't know elaborate background about it. Some people connect with the arrival of Zhabdrung Rinpoche, a revered Drukpa Kargyu lama, while some even goes to the extent of arguing that it flourished before him disconnecting with the latter. It is sung in a long rhythmic tune, some people even cough just hearing the term Zhungdra, and is widely recognised among the elderly people in the East, Western and Central parts of Bhutan. This type of song is rarely sung beheaded by the up-to-the-minute song that mostly talks and bases upon the foundation of Love, an inevitable whatchamacallit! Songs are the companion in solitude, I believe, but Zhungdra not only gives the calmness but aids strengthen unique cultural identity. As of this vitality, governments are striving for the betterment and enhancement of cultural uniqueness and preservation. \"Foo! What a monotonous dance is beginning the celebration. I don't think the celebration will be adequately fascinating.\" Declared Chhimi-- a balmy in our folk. \"Hahaha...will it be like your face then, eh?\" Cajoled Sangay. \"Hey guys! Don't blame and debase our traditional song that has been brought into existence since time immoral by the great saints and has been preserved in the time of turbulence and treacherous conjunctures which has hit the top list in our country's independence. Moreover, it has taken birth in our own land. \" Affirmed Dorji firmly proving his patriotism. \"You Wholly Mammoth, you have been existing since Neolithic Period or even during the first human evolution. Haha...\" Sangay taunted him sarcastically. It seemed these guys were debating, insulting and arguing one after another severely like bogged down people waiting for the opportunity. It got to my nerves. \"Stop it! Shut up morons... Let's enjoy it; may it be monotonous or fascinating.\" I said but fell on mine fall to detect my own conditions. \"Haha...look at him guys! He is trembling.\" Commented Chhimi. \"What's wrong with me, err?\" I muttered. \"Umm...am just...uh...irritated with you all.\" \"Gee! You're loosing your pluck and precisely looks like the ill cock after feeding on salt...um...NACL.\" Cajoled Chhimi, highly insulted. Moron! I loathe him sheerly not as he looks hideous though might contribute to some extent but because of his BS. He always pull others' legs and affirms himself no better than a cockamamie. The programme went off with the 'Zhungdra' dance by SCC members and few class ten's students. They're attractively embellished with traditional dress. Girls were adorned with colourful apparel with precious onyx, traditional scarf, blouse and sashed around their seductive waist. Boys were beautified with traditional gown with white cuff, scarf--yellow colour with flowers painted onto it, traditional shoes, and sword hanging beneath their idiot waists. Both girls and boys were beautified which they aren't in actuality. Their song was composed by a great Guru, but truly speaking, I don't know the name because am not known for Zhungdra by instinct. Their dance was just succumbing their bodies catching each other's hands. The nesh and smooth sexual invoking hands of fairies were firmly caught by boys. I was horny--as the hormone secretion by Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone(ICSH) and gonads might be hyper--secreted--looking at those ravishing damsels particularly their ever attractive busts and teats. I was envious with those fortunate boys who got a golden opportunity to catch their lovely hands and most probably to sniff their aromatic scents, hilarious thing! Damn! How hapless was I? It's followed by a folk of boys and girls who might be couples, probably as illicit sexual relationship was popular and was gaining the gusto in all nooks of everyone's burning veracity. They perform dance of recent creation, that is, 'Rigsar' or up-to-the-minute song which talks but about inevitable love and showering info barely. I am furious to those boys as their lubberly chests seem kissing the loverly girls' seductive and nesh bosoms, probably fresh! I was fancying , casting myself as one of them, should I be one of them, I would have grabbed those raunchy girls--apples in my eyes--in my ever selfish arms and would have never let them go. \"Haha...what happened to your tongue? It is twisting from one side to another!\"Chhimi jeers at me. What a jerk? I was day hallucinating. I quickly revived my consciousness. \"You f* bitch! You are always making fun of me. We are human and we do everything and no exception for me, too.\" I barked at him. He didn't respond other than smiling. The programme was indeed fascinating one probably due to being released from the study trauma. Finally, the programme called to end by Tashi Leypey Dance and we all were asked to get inside the MP Hall for lunch.[Chapter 3] A WEEK PROGRAMME GAVE ME SUFFICIENT TIME to roam Thimphu City. Remaining back at school and listening lectures is out of my interest. On March 1, I went to Thimphu. I got out from the van and enjoyed the beauty of Dochu La. The atmosphere encircling the Earth was chilly and unfriendly--a disgusting one but absorbing simultaneously, too. It let my goose-fleshed body to blench itself to conserve water from being perspired under coordination of the Central Nervous System. I could see numerous pimples-like dots sprouting from the base of my body hairs. The wind whooshed strong swaying the pine branches into different directions so endearingly furnishing the sensation of soaring high above to the ether where we can experience absolute euphoria and tranquility, from the materialistic world of never ending yearning. The landscape of Dochu La was infinitely picturesque flavoured with the wintry snowfall that whitened the entirety as far as my eagle-like eyes can espy. The famed Darkar La Range, arranged ideally with amusing cirrostratus as its background gave the superb view of the the last Shangri-La. The fluttering flags of Dochu La put about the message of peace and serenity of nature to every flat creature of the entirety, one is so blind and lame not to explore such a masterpiece of the Heaven concealed in our own paradise that we dwell in. The minuscule one-hundred and eight stupas set up in the idyllic location glitter with the sun and the moon proving their power to bless each and every up-and-coming creature and enliven the beauty of nature. I prayed with seriousness in my tone of prayers that I have never did before. It was en route my way from Sarpang to Thimphu, a sink where every graduate flows into. I descended down the steps and adjusted inside a Maruti Van reserved from Gelephu with the charge of Nu. 4000, which is about 200Km in length. The driver was quite drunk and was a drunkard because on the way he visited the bars on and off. I was terrified at his acceleration, driving in gear four screeching on the descending icy road, chances it may slip. Numerous heavy vehicles roared contradiction to our destiny that made mine fragile heart to cower oftentimes. \"Ashang, lower your acceleration. It's risky because there are heavy vehicles flying continuously. \" I exhorted him who time and again prepared a mouthful of 'doma' to adorn his red dingy mouth without a sense of terror. The van flied at high celerity but he was not at all getting cold feet, maybe he is expert or maybe may not. 'Haha...what happened my poor chap, hunh? Are you afraid?\" He asked showing his dirty teeth, due to excessive chewing of betel nut flavoured with lime. \"No. But, prevention is the best, isn't it uncle?\" I asked him, entrenching the seriousness in my voice. \"Yeah!\" He said,\" But this is nothing for me, I can even drive at 50Kmph, do I need to prove?\" \"No. No...no...no. No need! You can drive in gear 3 for now as its almost on the point of reaching the destiny. You will be fined by the traffics.\" I responded, difficult to swallow my own saliva. The apple orchards came into existence with numerous traditional hut houses with pebbles onto the roof to protect it from sliding or blown away by wind. All the apple trees were naked as the day one was born without a single leaf, maybe due to natural process of abscission. We plunged deeper and deeper. Finally, Semtokha approached in view and significantly the stout Buddha facing eastward towards Lungtenphu. I joined my palms together right at my heart and vowed with gratitude for my safety throughout the lengthy journey. I cited the mantra, 'Om Mani Pemay Hung' for my long life, though a science student and modernist by time and technology, but still deeply spiritual and religious. I believe the Omnipresent God and his existence, believed to be residing somewhere high in the Ether. His omnipresence and succour when ever necessary, the capacity to know everything and the power of being above death and born are incredibly sublime and these are the reasons why I appraise him. We passed through Army Headquarter, Royal Bhutan Army(RBA), and YHSS, Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School and then finally the cab parking above RSTA building. I dismounted and taken out the luggage from the Van. After the exchange of good-bye with the driver, I descended down the steps to the terminal. Startling, not before I could land my legs on the parking properly, drivers were snatching my luggage and postulating to travel by their taxis like dogs wearily aiming at the meat-- waiting for the pacific opportunity. I turned down their proposals and went to the downward direction, left side of the building where there was the long linear shop divided into many smaller compartments reserved by individuals. I bought a cup of tea and a plate of dumplings and refreshed myself. \"Babesa! Babesa! ...\" A driver was shouting. I hurried to and huddled inside and made myself eased and comfortable. He drove the Santro cab around the heavy traffic once and stopped. \"Brother, please wait a minute okay?\" He requested. \"Why?\" I replied impatiently. \"I have one passenger, hang a minute.''He replied locking his front door and disappeared into the sickening throng of townie and motors. I awaited about thirty minutes but he didn't turn up, it was 4:30 p.m. then. I felt completely ennui and started to play Facebook as a solace. An SMS buzzed: \"Hy...hi!\" It was Selden but written as 'Seday' in her Facebook account. She was mine friend from SCS. She is a very chatty and humour-filled woman, adored by most of the people. \"Hi\" \"Sup?\" \"Nothing. What about you?\" \"Nth..fyn. wer r u nawadys?\" \"Travelling Thimphu, you?\" \"@ hom onli. Misin' dos arguments and fights, haha\" \"Me, too.\" \"Jst kiding lol\" \"OK\" I SMSed but my last message didn't get dilevered due to fluctuation of network, strength ebbed to E from 4G or LTE. So I just turned off the mobile data connection and went for a short slumber. I heard somewhere into my deep sleep someone knocking the window shield. I woke up and looked outside. There was a young girl about nineteen of age peering modestly. So I opened the door and she entered with seducing smile. \"Thanks for waiting me. And how do you do? \" She enquired ardently, her mien showed the twinkling stars . \"No problem. Yeah, I am fine!\" I replied, turning the data on anew. \"Where are you going? I mean in which side of Thimphu are you residing?\" She inquired playing with her ebony hair. She got silky hair, beautiful complexion with big cute and pearly eyes and cutesy dimples while she smiles. \" Babesa, and you?\" I counter-asked. \"Ooh! OK. I am too Babesa. Then it means we are Babesain...haha\" She replied amusingly. \"You got a nice physique. I mean, you're beautiful. \" I commended blushingly, held my tongue and defended myself from the stupidity. \"Haha...Really? I don't think so. Anyways, thanks for the compliment.\" She replied and gave a sensualizing laugh. I was ashamed for the oblivious silly compliment I made to a completely alien like girl to whom I have never set my eyes. I felt completely absurd to converse with her further for mine devoid analysing power. How I would be if I was Omnipotent like the God? But it's an envisage next to nothing. I was lost through in my own reverie. While I was lost busying in my own world, our destination was called to halt. ''By the way what's your good name?\" She cleared her throat. \"Oh! Yeah\" I revived my consciousness and, \"My name is Dawa. And about you?\" I counter-asked. \"Lhasang. Haha!\" She replied again with the same sensualizing laugh. I couldn't further made enquiries and remained scratching my head. I couldn't speak out for which I would be in great remorse later. ''Anything?\" She made the way, probably seeing me null and helpless. \"Can I get your fb account?\" I asked but I pretty well lost my audibility. \"Of course! Lhasang Dee Luxe.\" And with the exchange of farewell, she went to her dwelling and I remained staring at her. \"Hey alu, what happened?\" The driver asked smilingly. \"Oh! Nothing.\" I replied blushingly. \"Haha...um...it's like that way only. I too in my early youth used to stare if I saw any beautiful girls. But one thing. You shouldn't keep it secret. Should you keep it unrevealed, you shall regret later and that's the reason for sadness. Whatever you feel should be spoken out whatever maybe its outcome, my dear boy!\" He patted on my shoulder and smiled. \"I too think it so.\" I responded. \"OK. Best wishes!\" He said and left. After a little conversation, I went to my uncle's home located just above the Central Plaza. By the time I reached uncle's home, it was twilight and earthly dusk was approaching by the blue ridges. I switched on the bell and my aunt opened the door with a hospitable smile on her wrinkled-rich face. \"Come on Dawa\" She welcomed me. \"OK auntie.\" \"Have a seat , nephew.\" She showed me the sofa and continued, \" So, your schooling?\" \"Oh Yeah. Holiday since we're having a week programme.\" I replied, felt little bit uneasy. \"Oh OK\" She said and continued, \" watch TV I will prepare tea for you.\" I opted for Sony Max, a Hindi movie channel, which was screening 'Ek Tha Tiger', a Salman Khan's movie. The protagonists were struggling from the antagonists as a result they were running, Salman disguising himself by attaching mustache on his face. ''Dawa, tea.\" I was interrupted by my auntie. \"OK, thanks auntie.\" I acknowledged with a boyish smile. I browsed Lhasang's account on the search box of the Facebook. Yes! She was there with a sweet smile while her face was adorned by two lovely dimples. I gazed at her bio. It was beautifully written \" I am not a world to be explored in a day.\" I didn't know what she meant by that phrase. I clicked on the send request button and waited patiently. ","Summary":" \"HELLO DAWA\" GREETED PENJOR, AN ENERGETIC BOY who wakes up first than anyone else. \"Yes Penjor, "},{"Movie":"Merlin","Title":"Bliss","Author":"GalitMirav","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13050793","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Merlin or any company or person associated with Merlin. I am not making money off this story. Merlin woke as the sun filled the cottage. The home where Ambrosia raised him, the home where he taught Arthur. Now it was his home with Nimue. He turned to look at her. She was still fast asleep beside him. He smiled. She was so beautiful. To think, just less than a day earlier, he never imagined in this lifetime he would see her again. ... They entered the cottage. Merlin was struck by the familiarity of it all. For the first time in years, he felt truly at home. Nimue had made it her own, and it was their home now. Nimue, meanwhile, was still in awe that they both were young again. He couldn't stop staring at her. How many years had she been free? Could he have reunited with her long ago? \" I went back,\" Merlin said. \"I went back to where the cave had been but it was gone. I thought you were lost to me forever. I never imagined you were freed. If I'd known, I would have kept searching for you.\" Nimue reached for his hand. \"I know. But you mustn't blame yourself. I wasn't freed immediately. It happened when…I figured out later that my release occurred at the same time Galahad retrieved the Holy Grail.\" \" Have you been here this whole time? Or did the illusion of the cottage fade along with the cave?\" \" There's so much to tell.\" She laughed softly, slightly overwhelmed at the thought. \"Where do I begin?\" He longed to hear what Nimue ' s life had been like all this time. \"I want to hear everything.\" She took a deep breath. \"The cave suddenly opened up. I don't know how long I stood there in shock.. I couldn't believe it. I thought I was dreaming. Finally, I started walking toward the opening. Just before stepping outside I turned back for some provisions in case I needed them fearing the cave might close behind me. It didn't, but I'm glad I took the provisions because it was some time before I reached any hint of civilization. I walked for several days. At last, I came upon a band of traveling musicians. Some of their party had fallen ill. I was able to cure them using the knowledge I gained from the nuns on Avalon. They repaid me by letting me travel with them.\" Merlin was amazed. His Nimue, always resourceful. What a very different life she had lived from the one she was born into. \"Did you ever think to return home?\" \" Briefly,\" she answered. \"But I immediately understood how impossible that was. Another family had long since lived there. And who would ever believe I was Lord Ardente's disfigured daughter, lost for years only to suddenly return unscarred? And the more I thought about it, the more I realized I had no desire to return either.\" She spoke without regret. \"I'm no noblewoman anymore; that was another life.\" \" So you decided to come here instead,\" Merlin concluded. \" Not at first. I did search for you but I didn't know where to look. I eventually made my way back to the woods where we first met. I even passed the mudhole where you saved my life.\" They both smiled at each other, each recalling the memory. They had barely been older than youths then, but it felt like yesterday. \"I wandered deeper until I came upon the cottage. The illusion of it had been my home in the cave, and so I felt like I had returned home. I decided to stay and wait for you.\" Merlin closed his eyes, wincing. So many years wasted! \"If only I had thought to return home!\" Nimue embraced him. \"It's alright, my love. We're together now.\" He clung to her, doing his best to push his anguished thoughts away. She was right. All the years they had lost were returned to them, and he couldn ' t wait to live them with her. His smile returned as he gazed into her eyes. How much did he love her! \"Tell me more.\" \" I get by living off of the land. The garden is full of vegetables and herbs and the trees are always abundant with fruit every year. I make baskets and other crafts and trade them with passing merchants for grain and anything else I need.\" She chuckled, remembering something from long ago. \"Archery was something they taught noblewomen as a hobby, but my instructor said I was far too aggressive and needed to be more lady-like when I shot. I'm glad I wasn't. It proved useful here. I had a regular supply of meat as well as pelt to trade until it become too hard to steady a bow and arrow.\" She smiled at him. \"Of course, now that I'm young again, I should be able to resume hunting. I'm glad now that I never traded my bow and arrows.\" \" I should take that up again too,\" Merlin mused, though it had been decades since he last hunted. \"Perhaps the next time a peddler makes his way through these woods, we should trade for another bow.\" \" Perhaps,\" Nimue concurred. She squeezed his hands. \"Tell me about you. What has your life been like all these years?\" He wasn't sure how to answer her at first. Finally, he just sighed. \"There isn't much to tell. I suppose I was withdrawn from the world. Everyone I loved or who ever loved me was gone. These last few years I've been wandering. Telling my story to whoever was interested in hearing it.\" \" Oh Merlin.\" Her heart broke for the man she loved. \"Surrounded by people but alone at heart.\" He regarded her, noting how well-adjusted she seemed despite her isolation. \"And you? You don't feel alone?\" \" Sometimes,\" she admitted. \"But there's so much to be done around here that it keeps me busy. The woods aren't completely empty, either. There are peasants scattered throughout. I've traded with them. And after they learned I have medical knowledge, they've sought me out when needed and I've tended to them. I'm the closest to a physician they're able to see.\" \" So you're happy, Nimue?\" \" Yes. Now, more than ever. All that was missing was you. And now I have you back.\" She smiled at him. He pulled her into a hug, kissing her tenderly. \"And I have you back.\" They remained in a tight embrace, so happy to be together they had to laugh to keep from crying. It was some time before they finally let go, both still overwhelmed that they were finally together with their whole lives ahead of them. Merlin suddenly thought of a small problem. \"What shall we do the next time your neighbors come by and see that you're now a young lady instead of an old woman? Even if they believe it was magic, that might frighten them all the more.\" Nimue furrowed her brow. That was an issue they needed to consider. After a few seconds, her expression relaxed as she came up with a solution. \"We'll tell them the Nimue they knew passed away. I'm her niece, also called 'Nimue', and you are my husband.\" \" Brilliant,\" Merlin declared, kissing her again. \"Husband?\" He teased, raising an eyebrow with a smile. \" Are we not to be husband and wife?\" she asserted. Her eyes radiated with love. \"I don't need a priest to bless our union. As far as I'm concerned, we've been married at heart nearly all of our lives.\" \" I feel the same way.\" They were silent for a few seconds, simply staring into each other ' s eyes, drinking in the sight of each other. At last, Merlin reached out and caressed her face. \"Oh Nimue…\" They were truly together! He kissed her passionately. \"I love you.\" She kissed him in return with equal intensity. \"I love you.\" They soon ceased talking in favor of a more intimate reunion. ... Merlin's eyes were still on Nimue as he recalled yesterday. They made love twice the previous night. The first time was admittedly awkward, given that it was the first time for both of them. But by the second time, they had found their rhythm, and soon fell asleep in each other's arms. He couldn't wait for her to wake up naturally. He needed her now. He leaned in to kiss her, starting at her temple and leaving a trail of soft kisses down her cheek, her neck… \"Merlin…\" she giggled, waking just as he reached her shoulder. His eyes beamed at her and he smiled broadly. \"Good morning, wife.\" He wrapped his arms around her and held her close. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Very.\" she snuggled into his embrace and gazed at him. \"You?\" \"Very.\" They huddled even closer; each silently basking in the other's presence. \"I want to stay like this forever,\" Merlin admitted. \"And at the same time, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\" \"I feel that way too,\" Nimue responded, planting a kiss on his arm that was wrapped around her. \"And what should that life entail?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I don't know…\" Nimue began, in a tone that suggested she in fact did know. \"Children, perhaps?\" \"Children?\" Merlin was slightly caught off guard, but he didn't stop smiling. Arthur was the closest thing to a child he ever had, and he still lived with the pain of his loss everyday. He never imagined he would have children of his own, with Nimue being lost to him. But now that they were together again, anything was possible. \"I'd like that very much.\" \"I want at least four.\" \"Four?\" She nodded. \"Ambrosia, Elissa, Arthur, and Ardente. What do you think?\" \"Those are lovely names, Nimue.\" He couldn't stop smiling \"Do you think we made a child last night?\" Nimue asked. \"I certainly hope so,\" Merlin answered. Then he smiled mischievously. \"But just in case we didn't, perhaps we should try again…\" he kissed her forehead, \"…and again…\" her lips, \"…and again…\" her neck… \"Yes Merlin!\" she exclaimed as he moved lower. \"Yes!\" Her hands were on him in turn, and they were making love again.

'Mab! Queen Mab!' she cried out. A figure formed out of the great rock - it is Queen Mab. Darkly beautiful dressed in glittering robes which swirled in the wind behind her. 'Ah, Lady...why didnt you come before? Ive followed you all my life and now its ending. We are in hell! You must stop the killings?' the old priestess gripped the hem of the goddess robes desperately. Mab crouched down beside her. 'I no longer have the power, Gudrun too many of my followers have forsaken the Old Ways and become Christian.' she rasped quietly. Gudrun's eyes glinted fiercely. 'Fight! Come out of the land of magick and fight for what we once had, The people will come back to the Old Ways as if newborn fight, Lady!' she held out a bloodstained hand, the Queen clasped her hand. 'I swear to bring back the Old Ways!' Mab vowed. Gudrun smiled. 'Raise me up I want to see the sun go down one last time before I die.' Mab helped Gudrun stand upright, painfully, and the two women watched as the sun sank below the horizon letting the darkness descend. Ambrosia watched in anger as Queen Mab fawned over the newborn babe, she had not even spared a glance towards the poor girl who had bore him. \"Served her purpose.\" Mab was stone cold she had no love in her heart. The old woman remembered in her youth how the people had loved the goddess once how they had celebrated the old ways and paid homage to their queen. Mab had always been beautiful, benevolent, but now? A monster. Ambrosia could not bring herself to feel sympathy for Mab or her cause she remembered the slaughter, her friends, family, neighbours, all murdered by christians and where had Mab been then? She did not deserve her love. She did not deserve her faith. \"Then you changed and became a christian.\" Mab rasped. Much to her delight Ambrosia was offended and denied this, so she had not turned her back on the old ways. The goddess was happy about this she was fond of Ambrosia. Ok things were far from ideal but it would all work out in the end, once Merlin was grown and leading her cause, leading the people back to her everything would go back to how it should be. Ambrosia would forgive her with time and love her once again. Mab had complete faith in this, Ambrosia would return to her, and Mab would be triumphant.

Transparent clouds traveling at the sphere's side veiled it in shades of violets, grays, and tones gold-blue. Nimue watched the clouds sailing across the sky; they separated the moon's light from her room. Candles were lit on corner tables, and in their different light lingered the man she loved. He too, was observing the moon. His arms were folded over his chest as he leaned against the wall. His profile was half-seen, half imagined against the dark. There was a weakness about Nimue, as though she had mournfully cried. With that weakness her body sought sleep. She knew with Merlin near, she would feel a peace that normally eluded her. Yet, as he smiled at her, she wanted to resist the beckon of her body. \"Merlin,\" she started, \"please let me hear your voice.\" He turned to her, sweetly amused, caught off guard. With her eyes closed she smiled. \"I would love to hear a story.\" \"Oh, it's a story you want? From the looks of things, you'll probably be asleep before you hear the ending.\" \"Then you can tell me a story I've already heard before, that way it won't matter.\" \"Very well.\" Merlin's gaze returned to the moon as he tried to settle on a thought. \"Ah, I know just the one. And it is a story you have heard many times. One that you're undoubtedly tired of.\" Nimue tutted. He sighed then rolled up his sleeves. \"Let me provide a bit of a distraction first.\" Nimue watched as he quickly created symbols with his hands that she couldn't decipher; minute waves and rolls of his wrists, and soon a progression of fireflies entered the window. Slowly floating, they bobbed in the wind that was to them the same as tides. The candles dimmed with Merlin's silent command, making the fireflies glow like a hundred small stars. Merlin paused as he watched Nimue's face in the dark. She was so beautiful, so kind and wise beyond her years. In Nimue there was no corruption of spirit, and he loved her all the more for it. She was unique in his life. He caught her warm eyes, fixed on him. For all the fire in them, he knew it must also be displayed in his own gaze, even if only minutely. He loved her with all his being. \"Now let me think, where to begin... \" ~oOo~ ","Summary":" ~oOo~ Through her prison window the moon could be seen.

I know next to nothing about C.C., this simply came to me and seemingly wrote itself. I believe the girl, in my version, has psychic abilities. ~oOo~ Seeking God's council, Nimue walked past the nave of Avalon Abbey and to its sanctuary. She could not sleep for her thoughts; she feared for Merlin's life and the state of those he loved. She feared for the future of England as Queen Mab's constant planning and scheming seemed always a step ahead. Merlin had not visited Avalon for weeks, and she'd heard no word from him. The days were lonely and at times bleak. Now that her father was gone, she realized how completely alone she was in the world. She had no one to turn to aside from God whose grace and love she was eternally thankful. The Abbey was empty at such a late hour. Dozens of candles burned brightly at an altar, and, in a strange way, the flames shining on the stained glass windows brought Nimue comfort. The Abbey was warm and quiet, scented of beeswax and incense. Nimue came to kneel before the altar, lighting a candle of her own. A sudden peace came over her as she began to pray. After some time had passed, she heard behind her a beautiful voice begin to sing verse in Latin. Nimue rose, turning toward the sound, and as she did the song abruptly halted. The voice belonged to a young girl standing at the entrance to the Abbey. \"Forgive me if I startled you. I didn't see you there,\" the girl said. She came forward. She was not embarrassed or ashamed from being overheard, her only concern was Nimue's welfare. \"There's no need to apologize. Your voice is beautiful.\" Nimue paused, her gaze turned downward in recollection then returned to the young girl. \"I've heard it before - the night I came here. I thought then that yours was the voice of an angel, and that in my state I had heard voices from heaven... but now I learn that you are of flesh and blood, like myself. Tell me, how ever did you learn to sing as you do?\" \"I have sung like this for as long as I can remember,\" she said without pride. \"The sisters tell me my voice is a gift from God.\" \"Indeed it is. God has truly blessed you. My goodness. So strong a voice in such a young a girl. He must have quite a future planned for you.\" \"But God has blessed you as well, my Lady. Not many survive dragon's fire, yet here you stand before me. And though you smile, I can see in your eyes a great sadness where there should only be joy; God's love.\" Nimue was uncertain how to feel. She was not aware her state of heart could be so plainly read. She hurriedly made sure her face remained covered by her cowl. Her voice was colder than before. \"God is always with me. I know his love. I feel it even now.\" \"It is the love of another, the Pagan wizard who brought you to these Holy shores. His absence troubles you?\" \"Yes...\" Nimue replied with some hesitance. \"But Merlin does not follow the Old Ways. He wishes to see their end... Too much time has passed since last I heard from him. I have no way of knowing his current state.\" The girl stepped forward and took one of Nimue's hands in hers. \"But you do. You have your heart. You have God's confidence. You know now that your wizard is alive. Many things take him from you, but he will always return because he loves you.\" Nimue smiled, a laugh escaped. Her eyes were beginning to tear. She gripped the girl's hand tightly, feeling as though she had known her much longer than she had. She felt a loving, sisterly connection. Nimue wrapped her arms around the girl, embracing her. \"What is your name?\" Nimue asked close to her ear, the girl's hair catching on Nimue's cowl. \"Hilaria.\" \"Well, Hilaria. I am so thankful we have been brought together. It feels so good to have made a friend.\" \"I am your friend now, Lady Nimue. I always have been, we simply never spoke before. You need never be lonely. Tomorrow we are to harvest Avalon's famed apples, will you join us?\" \"I would... But are you sure the others...\" Hilaria searched Nimue's eyes. \"The others?\" \"That they will not feel the need to comment on my appearance? Laugh at me and point?\" \"Lady Nimue, they have no reason to. The sisters and brothers of this island do not judge you for your outwardly appearance. Besides, you hardly give them reason to; your face is always hidden.\" Nimue considered Hiliaria's invitation and her reasoning. Her manner was kind, infectious. \"Perhaps I will join you, but only for a little while.\" \"Good. I'm glad.

I don't think it's ever actually specified where Hector lives in the film, and I don't have the novels immediately to hand, so I've just made it up. Merlin walked quietly beside Sir Rupert, ears attuned to the sounds of the forest around him. Every snap of a twig, every rustling of leaves had him on edge. Finally, with a sigh, he halted his horse and sank down to the floor, crossing his legs and closing his eyes. Years of not using magic at all, and then more years of only using it out of necessity had taken their toll on his instincts. It took him a few moments to concentrate his senses, but as he moved his hands in a wide arc, he was pleased to find that the spell worked just as he remembered it. Mab and Frik would be so proud , he thought to himself dryly. As he had hoped, the spell revealed no other humans in the nearby forest besides himself. A bird took off from a nearby tree, setting the leaves to rustling. A squirrel darted across the forest floor, accidentally snapping a twig as it went. Satisfied, he pulled himself to his feet and set off through the trees once more with a spring in his step. \"Did that finally set your mind at ease, Master Merlin?\" Sir Rupert sounded almost teasing, \"Or will we be stopping for a sixth time before we get there?\" Merlin raised his eyebrow, \"I do apologise for the inconvenience, Sir Rupert. I thought you might be glad of the rest. Besides, we can't be too careful. Uther might still have his men on the lookout.\" \"I would be more glad of a rest with some hay and a blanket,\" the horse replied balefully, \"How many times will we have to make this journey before you admit that Uther's spies aren't coming? If there is a threat to Arthur, it's not one you can prevent this way.\" Merlin sighed. Sir Rupert had a point. Rumours from the king's court spoke of an increasingly insular and paranoid king, of the first signs of madness. The likelihood of Uther finding his son faded with every passing year, and it seemed that the likelihood of him even still looking was becoming more remote. The only person who knew of Arthur's location and his relationship to Uther was Merlin himself, and he had avoided the king steadfastly since removing Excalibur from his keeping. Of course, Mab probably knew too, he had no doubt that she was keeping tabs on his movement, or at least having Frik do it for her. Merlin knew he wasn't powerful enough to shield Arthur from her gaze, but he knew there would be no benefit to her from bringing Arthur's location to Uther's attention – he simply had to trust that a loathed Christian king on the throne with no acknowledged heirs was a more enticing prospect to her than spiting her estranged son. He shook the thoughts of threats from his head and smiled to himself upon hearing the playful shouts of children echoing around the fields below, before reaching the crest of the hill and finally being able to look across to the small but well fortified castle, where Arthur lived and played under the guardianship of his foster father, Sir Hector, and where Merlin served in the capacity as tutor to both Arthur, and Hector's son Kay. Hector did not know Arthur's true parentage – of course, he knew that the boy was more than simply a foundling that Merlin had taken pity on, perhaps he thought the small child to be the son of one of Uther's enemies, the number of which seemed to be growing daily. Technically Merlin supposed that was true – from the few whispers that he had picked up, Igraine had harboured no love for the king, less so after he killed her husband and left her reputation in tatters. Had she lived more than a day or two past Arthur's birth she may have grown to love the boy, but he would have been raised hating his father. You don't care that he would have hated Uther. A little voice in his mind that always sounded like some mixture of Mab and Ambrosia reminded him sharply. You hate Uther. You care that he would have hated you. That much was true. Merlin had tried to maintain a certain distance from Arthur in his early years, knowing that Uther would have his spies out searching for any sign of his son. Hence bringing him to Hector, a minor lord of a wild land who rarely came to court since Uther's victory had been assured and his sword was no longer needed. But as it became increasingly apparent that Uther's search for his bastard son was bearing no fruit, Merlin had started spending weeks and then months at a time here in Rheged, and in watching Arthur grow he had grown to love the boy as if he was his own. The idea of Arthur being raised by his own mother, raised to hate Merlin, cut him deeply, and in some unworthy part of him he thought that perhaps Igraine's death had been for the best, for she might not have given up her own search for her son quite so easily. And as for his father, well... Perhaps the best thing for Arthur was for his father to be as Elissa had been to Merlin – unknown, an idea more than a person. He could build up fond ideas in his head whilst safely away from the reality. Of course, Arthur would have to learn the truth of his parentage at some point. When he was a grown man, old enough to accept the idea of his future kingship and accept the kind of man his father was. Or better yet, once Uther was dead and gone. Merlin couldn't see any good coming of Arthur and Uther meeting together as father and son. It would likely go one of two ways, either Arthur would choose to idolise his father, as so many children do, and end up corrupted by the mess that was the current king of Britain, or the knowledge of his father's true nature would crush him. Neither was a desirable outcome. It wasn't such a very bad thing to be raised without knowing your parents, Merlin thought to himself. After all, he had been raised by Ambrosia and she had been no relative of his by blood or magic. And yet, she had given him her love, and a happy childhood. Hector was different from Ambrosia in many ways – his quiet devotion to the New Religion compared to her firm insistence that religion, be it old or new, was far more trouble than it was worth, his castle and lands compared to a small hut in the forest, his wife and son and household compared to the animals and hermits of the forest. And yet, Hector shared one important quality with Ambrosia- an open heart, a willingness to care for those in need. Merlin had brought Arthur here to keep him safe, but it was a relief to know that Hector and his wife made him happy, too. And what does that make you, Merlin? That inner voice spoke up again, as Merlin turned a fond gaze onto the curly haired boy in the courtyard chasing after his older foster brother with a child's cheery determination. You love the boy too, as if he were your own child. So if Uther is Elissa in this scenario, and Hector is Ambrosia, then who does that leave you with? The thought was jarring. Merlin shook his head, trying to rid his head of the thought. There might be some similarities with his childhood and Arthur's, he told himself. But that alone did not make him similar to Mab. The situation here was completely different... You, who used your magic to ensure Arthur's conception. You who let others die to serve your purpose. You who would teach Arthur, who would raise him as your champion, to fulfil all of your hopes and dreams. Who does that make you? Merlin had to stop walking for a moment, so shaken was he by the thought. He had avoided – perhaps deliberately avoided – thinking too deeply about his actions, about any consequences beyond the birth of Arthur. It was for the greater good. He had believed it at the time of Arthur's conception, he believed it still with all the confidence of prophecy and natural, unshakeable stubbornness. He had done this for Britain, not for himself. And yet, he wondered to himself, is that what Mab had thought all those years ago? That his birth would save the country, save the Old Ways, and that everything else was unimportant by comparison? He hadn't agreed with her on Ambrosia's deathbed. Did he agree with her on Gorlois's deathbed, on Igraine's? It was at that moment that a loud call from nearby broke Merlin out of his dark introspection. Arthur had spotted him, and come bounding up to greet his tutor, a grin on his face heedless of everything from the grass stains on his clothes to the wizard's inner turmoil. It was, Merlin reflected, quite hard to stay miserable in the face of such cheeriness. He smiled at the boy in return and ruffled his hair before following him back to Hector's castle. He had done wrong, he conceded to himself. Perhaps he was more similar to Mab than he would ever like to admit. Perhaps his justifications to himself were as hollow as hers had been. But he allowed himself one plea – to himself, to fate, to whichever god was paying attention – that if he was to Arthur as Mab was to him, even if it was his destiny to repeat every other mistake that his mother had made, that he never caused Arthur the hurt that Mab had caused him.

Heads up. I would be greatly indebted to you if you left a review! Disclaimer : I don't own Merlin. as much as I wish I did, I'm not that rich. * All it took was a single moment. Merlin didn't know when it had started. Perhaps it was when he killed Nimueh, or maybe even earlier than that, when he drank the poison chalice meant for Arthur. Or it might have been later, with Balinor's death. Nevertheless, Merlin could not pinpoint a single moment when the pain he was feeling began to numb. But, over the years it had become part of his daily routine. Nod respectfully, put on a goofy smile to mask the hurt, and pretend everything was alright when in reality everything was quite the opposite. This was Merlin's life now. He would run himself weary doing chores for both Gaius and Arthur, he dealt with the castle household, managing all that needed to be dealt with, and in between all of that he constantly saved the King's life. Eventually, it got to the point where he was too busy to feel any pain at all. He simply nodded and smiled and played the part of a happy-go-lucky servant, loyal to his kingdom and his King until his dying breath. And while the second part was very, very true, the first was incredibly less so. He supposed, of course, it had to happen sometime. Everyone had to break eventually, even the greatest Sorcerer of all time. He could blame Arthur, he's supposed. It was his fault that Merlin was huddled in one of the turrets at the top of the castle. Well, perhaps not entirely his fault, but it was definitely instigated by the young king. It had been a normal evening after returning from another magical creature fight. Arthur was looking over kingly papers, Merlin had been cleaning and humming one of the club's favorite songs to ease his weary heart. The rain outside was pounding against the stone, and thunder rumbled in the distance. Suddenly, a crack of lightning lit the room around them, and the brief image of Nimueh flashed across his mind, and Merlin had dropped the pitcher in his hands. He scrambled to pick it up even as Arthur insulted his clumsiness. But, when the servant did not reply, the king had huffed. \" You really are an idiot, Merlin .\" \" Yes, you never fail to remind me .\" Merlin had replied, a little too sad and accepting than he wished. He heard a chair scrape across the floor, and Arthur's calming voice. \" Merlin ? Are you alright ?\" He was about to retort that yes, of course he was, he always was, when Arthur dropped to his knees in front of him and snatched his wrist. \" Merlin !\" At first, the sorcerer had been confused, but when he followed Arthur's fingers, he saw the blood dripping down his pale skin. \" Huh ,\" he had scoffed. \" I didn't even notice .\" That seemed to worry his best friend greatly, if his furrowed eyebrows were anything to go by. Arthur grabbed one of the napkins on the nearby table and wrapped it around the injury. He pulled up the sleeve to get better access, and Merlin swallowed, hoping he wouldn't notice. But Arthur wasn't stupid. Arthur had asked about the scar on Merlin's forearm. It was a casualty of his kidnapping by Morgana, was his closest guess, but he couldn't really tell for sure. After so many years of saving Arthur's royal backside, all the pain and the scars kind of just jumbled up together. Of course, he couldn't tell Arthur that. He'd have to explain how he got in such a situation in the first place, how he escaped, and what happened afterwards. So, he had simply muttered something about tripping in the halls and his arm getting caught on a door handle before continuing to clean the room. It wasn't a believable excuse, he knew. Arthur knew it too. \" Merlin ,\" his tone had been edged with warning. \" Where did you get this ?\" \" N-nowhere .\" Merlin had stammered, pulling down his sleeve, but not quickly enough for the king to miss the 4 thin scars lining his bicep. \" What about these ?!\" Arthur's voice was rising in both volume and angry concern. \" Those look like claw marks, Merlin !\" Merlin had wanted nothing else than to disappear or turn invisible. To de-exist, if that was possible, and then he wouldn't have to bear this shame. He had no excuses to give, or at least none that wouldn't reveal his secret. But, brain barely working, he muttered, \" That was a cat .\" \" Merlin, do you think me stupid ?\" Merlin had swallowed, pushed forth a goofy grin, and said, \" Only on your good days .\" Arthur had grabbed his shoulder tightly and growled, \" This isn't funny, Merlin, now tell me where you got these. Now !\" Merlin had choked up then, partially because Arthur's fingers were squeezing directly into the wound he had received merely hours ago when he had returned from fighting a Chimera, and partially because everything was coming back in a single moment. The unearthed pain of the passed 8 years crashed into him like a tidal wave, and it took every ounce of strength the dark haired man possessed not to cry right there. Even then, tears threatened to overtake his vision as he croaked, voice so different than before. \" It's nothing .\" \" Merlin .\" Arthur's voice had turned soft. \" Merlin, you can trust me .\" And Merlin wanted too. God, he wanted to trust Arthur in that moment more than he had ever wanted anything. But years of self-hate and denial were stronger than his wants. \" I-I can't .\" He moved to stand, and pulled free from Arthur's comforting hold. \" Merlin -!\" \" You wouldn't understand .\" Merlin had managed quietly, backing towards the door. \" I'm fine, Arthur, really. Nothing to worry about. Just silly old me .\" There was something in Arthur's expression that made Merlin curious. What reason did the king of Camelot to look at him in such ferocious terror? Merlin wasn't in danger. \" Merlin ,\" it was the kind of tone used on a jittery horse or a man about to jump off of a high castle wall. \" Merlin, talk to me. I'll listen .\" Merlin wanted to believe that, to believe that if he told Arthur he'd understand. But the reality that Arthur was Uther's son when it came to magic stilled him, and his hand found the door. \" You-you'll hate me .\" Was his stammered reply. \" Merlin ,\" it had been barely a breath, and it was sad, oh so sad, and Merlin swallowed, but the love that shown from his friend's eyes was enough to halt his escape. \" There is nothing in this world that could make me hate you .\" the emotion in his tone was enough to make Merlin want to collapse in his embrace, to spill all of his secrets and burdens at once. And that terrified him. So Merlin had run. He had pushed back against the wooden door and dashed down the corridor, ignoring Arthur's shout of protest. And so here he was, in the highest tower that the castle could provide, his entire body shaking. The tears in his eyes wouldn't leave, as if the walls that Merlin had built were too strong even now, when he wanted to feel the pain. When he wanted to cry, to scream, to let it all out in a glorious swoop. But he couldn't. Even as he pounded his hand against the stone wall around him, as the makeshift bandage slipped from his skin and the blood flowed freely from his knuckles, no tears fell down his face. What was wrong with him? So, so many things. It's lonely , his own voice echoed inside his mind as he stared at the lighting cackling across the sky. To be more powerful that any man you know. Be special and have to pretend you're a fool . \"Merlin?\" Arthur. Merlin didn't have anywhere else to run, and while he had considered jumping from the window, he knew he couldn't. Not when Arthur still needed him. Not when Arthur would always need him. \"Merlin.\" His voice was filled with relief, and he fell to his knees before the sorcerer. \"Hey.\" \"Is for horses.\" He whispered back. \"Yes, yes it is.\" The prat smiled, but his face fell when he saw his friend's wrecked hands. \"Oh, Merlin.\" \"I know.\" He sighed heavily. \"I just...\" Arthur frowned and took his servant's bloody fingers into his, wrapping them in more napkins. \"You do trust me, don't you Merlin?\" \"Of course.\" He answered immediately. \"You know that.\" \"Then... why keep this from me?\" he gestured towards the concealed scars on his left arm. \"If you think that's bad, you should see my back.\" He clamped a hand over his mouth, eyes widening at the proclamation. \"More secrets?\" those golden eyebrows raised in concern. \"I'm not sure I can handle many more secrets.\" \"Well, I've got the lot of them.\" The warlock sighed heavily, and it was as if the world was resting on his shoulders. \"You know, I could order you to tell me.\" \"When have I ever done as you tell me?\" Both chuckled at this, and Arthur tied the makeshift bandage around Merlin's pale wrist. \"If I asked you, would you tell me?\" Merlin thought for a moment, and then muttered, \"You'd hate me.\" Arthur sighed as he sat down in front of his friend. \"I told you, nothing could ever make me hate you.\" He grabbed Merlin's arm. \"Nothing.\" \"I disagree.\" He snorted. \"What is it, Merlin? Are you secretly in love with Gwen? Is your kitten dying? Does this have to do with your magic?\" Merlin's breath hitched. \"My-my what?\" \"Your magic.\" Arthur repeated. \"You know, Merlin, I'm not that thick.\" Merlin scooted away. His entire world was shutting down. this didn't make any sense! \"You-you know?\" Arthur just gave him that look, and said, \"I've also heard we have a destiny.\" It wasn't supposed to happen like this. he had formed it in so many ways in his mind, some good, some horrible, but this was not planned. There was no time for Merlin to come up with some witty retort or a wonderful speech about loyalty and what not. All he could do was swallow and blink, but he gave a small nod. \"Well, Merlin, do you know the meaning of share?\" he continued looking at him as if this was a misunderstanding about saddles, not a criminal offense . \"Unless it's changed since this morning...\" the confused warlock muttered. \"Good. Then you should realize that we should be doing this together.\" Arthur bumped his shoulder. \"Merlin,\" The indicated man didn't respond, merely stared at the rumbling storm. \"Merlin.\" He tried again. Nothing. \"Merlin, look at me.\" Finally, he looked back at his king. \"What? Are you going to tell me to stop? Well I can't Arthur, I was born like this. Or maybe if I preferred burning at the stake or beheading? Or how many times I've saved your life because honestly I have no idea. Is it-?\" \"Merlin.\" Arthur's tone became serious. \"I'm not going to have you beheaded or-or burned!\" It seemed the mere mention of such a thing was disgusting to him, and he took Merlin's hands. \"I-I could never- do you really think that I would...\" Arthur touched his face to amke sure that Merlin held his gaze. \"Merlin, you aren't alone.\" And in that single moment, Merlin felt like he could fly. The tears started then, and Arthur hugged him for as long as they continued. The two men spoke for hours into the night, sometimes the king, sometimes his sorcerer, and by the end it wasn't just Merlin whose cheeks were wet with tears. Merlin began at, well, the beginning. He told his best friend of how his childhood was a cold, separated one. How he was mistreated and estranged from the people of his village. He recounted many times that he had saved Arthur's hide, but not all of them because even he could not remember. He talked of his father just as the raining stopped, and then of Freya and their love. He named each scar on his body, and this is when Arthur took him and held him for what seemed like forever, whimpering apologies. Merlin simply stroked his hair and fondly called him \"Prat\" and chuckled. They fell asleep in that tower, ignoring the gossip that would surely follow tomorrow, laughing at some joke Merlin had told and that was when he realized it. With Arthur's head on his shoulder, and his own eyelids dropping, he knew that for once in his life, despite the pain and torture and death, that he was not alone. All it took was a single moment.

But never mind, here is my answer to the March challenge prompt \"Faith\" (yes, I have used the most imaginative of titles for my entry :P) Makes a couple of mentions to events that only happen in the novelisation (Vortigern's attempted marriages, etc.) but you don't need to have read it to understand what's going on. Hopefully. Vortigern has never believed in any gods, not really, not in their capacity to alter his life. Some men – weak men, foolish men – might have believed in them after three of his brides died in quick succession. Or after over twenty years of his reign has not even produced so much as a bastard daughter from a whore or a serving wench – and he has had plenty of both. Others, fools like the soothsayer, saw bad omens in the fact that his castles wouldn't stand. He had given fools like that an inch, and that was how all of his current troubles had started – Merlin's dreams, Mab's plots, Ardente's defection. See what good came of listening to gods? Vortigern has never had faith in anything, except for himself – the strength of his arm, the cut of his sword. Faith that he will dispatch his enemies and grind their remains into dust. For a man who doesn't believe in anything but himself, his faith is strong, almost unshakeable. He has the weight of history behind him, after all – he has never lost a battle before. He has faith, as he commands his men to charge Uther's army. He has faith as he drives his sword into Ardente's chest and the blood pours out into the snow below the dead man. He has faith as he brings his sword down towards the traitor wizard's head. Such is his faith that it takes him a few moments, as his sword shatters against Merlin's, as the man before him raises the blade above his own head, for that self belief to waver and for him to genuinely consider that he might die. When it does, his confusion is met with one moment of clarity, almost of relief – at least he will die on the battlefield, a sword in hand. He might not leave a legacy of sons, or of castles, or even of much fondness from the people he has ruled these past decades, but at least he will leave the memory of a fearsome warrior behind him. Perhaps Merlin knows this. Perhaps he performs his next action out of spite – revenge for months of imprisonment and mistreatment, revenge for Ardente's daughter. Perhaps in that bizarre wizard mind he actually sees it as a kindness. But whatever the reason, he doesn't use the blow to split Vortigern's skull, or plunge it into his heart. Instead he brings it down against the ice – and for a moment, Vortigern assumes that the wizard is either a complete idiot, or a terrible aim, and his faith returns in a flash. After all, it's still entirely possible to kill a man with only half a sword, if the man can't hit you with his own. Then the ice opens up below him and he plunges into the icy water below. His heavy cloak and armour drag him down. Above him, he can see the ice sealing up. All he can think is that this cannot be happening. He is the King of Britain, he is a warrior. This cannot be his end – plunged into icy water to drown by a wizard who can barely pick up a sword. His lungs are burning, he knows that if he cannot reach the surface he will be dead soon. His muscles are seizing up with cold, which will make that tricky. And then, salvation. A glistening woman drifting towards him in the water, an impossibility. As she gets closer, her features become clearer. She is shining and clad in white, like the angels that the Christians speak of, but her features bear a remarkable similarity to Mab. Vortigern would groan if he had the air to do so. Have all the gods come together to taunt him in his final moments? Her features are kind – not so like Mab's, then – and she reaches out to touch his face. She doesn't seem to have any trouble breathing underwater, and Vortigern realises in an instant what he will do. He grabs her, pulls her towards him. She comes closer without complaint, and he presses his mouth to hers. He will take the air from her, use it to give him the strength to fight his way back to the surface, and leave her behind here. As he has done before – by taking Mab's offer and then slaughtering her followers, by taking Christian gold and burning down their churches, by taking Merlin's advice and then imprisoning him and sending his love to her doom. What does it matter, as long as he survives, as long as he remains king? But this time is not like the others. Her lips move against his, almost in a kiss, and her hands slide up to cup his face. But when he opens his mouth, rather than the air he is expecting, he feels a wave of water pour into his mouth, into his lungs. His body convulses. He tries to kick her away but his feet simply drift through her, and when he tries to pull away from their kiss, her gentle touch seems as immovable as steel. He tries to scream, but all that comes out of his mouth are bubbles. She finally releases him and he breaks for the surface – tries to – his arms and legs won't obey him, his body desperately trying to expel the water in his lungs. He can vaguely make out the ice above him, a patch of light shining through the thick snow. He hears her voice in his ear. \"You are dying.\" It is soft. It is soothing. It is the most terrifying thing he has ever heard in his life. \"Your reign is over, King Vortigern. Rest now.\" He can't rest. He won't rest. He tries to swim away from her, towards the patch of light. \"Come with me.\" A glowing hand reaches out to him and touches his cheek, and all within his chest seems to burn with a screaming pain. Above him, he sees the light go out. \"You are in my kingdom now.\" They are the last words he hears. And within him, the last remnants of Vortigern's unshakeable faith march to their death just moments ahead of the king himself.

The wavering light and darkness were the same as the thoughts that drifted behind her eyes, and she was in them tinted rose, orange and shifting shades of gray. Ambrosia's back was to the girl, and the older woman spoke thoughtfully as she put together their evening meal. Tendrils of steam played about her fingers as she lowered vegetables into the broth of the cauldron. \"When Spring comes, I'll have you with me. We'll comb over all of Barnstable Forest. I'll show you where to find herbs, which places to avoid. It'll take some time, but I dare say you might even grow to enjoy the work after a while.\" Ambrosia's words filled Elissa with a sense of forlorn and of doubt. She couldn't envision the future Ambrosia saw, not for herself or her child; a peaceful life as aide to a former priestess. She could see nothing beyond birthing the being that had as a splinter been placed within her womb. No matter how many times she daydreamed about her child it too was enshrouded in shadow. She had more than once seen a hand clutching an infant's but that hand was never her own. Despite her unease, she hoped that what she was experiencing was something that all expectant mothers faced at one time or another. She could not ask her mother. \"The babe can come along, no need to worry. I'll make a carrier, so that it may be close to you. You'll get to know these woods like the back of your hand. It's best to get the child used to the forest early on. Let all of this good green earth sink into its bones and blood. It'll be just the thing for it.\" Ambrosia spirited herself back to her area of crookery, clucking her tongue as she remembered a neglected ingredient. The girl lowered the cup of tea from her lips and looked to the smoke rising to exit through the roof. She thought of the onyx fog that had descended upon her while she was allowed the honor of guarding the Holy Grail. The smoke that created within her a life which had lead her to be cast from Avalon Abbey. Her dreams were lost to her, those of becoming a holy sister, living out her days at the abbey surrounded by friends and the holiness of the grail. The child, she knew, for good or ill would be great and formidable. And she did not know how to feel about such a being growing inside of her. ~o~ Turning away from the sun, Morgan awoke to find her paramour just as she'd left him in the night. She rose to her knees, smoothed down the bunched fabric of her white sleeping gown, and reached over his form to a beside table. Once she had in her hand her comb and mirror, she settled ungracefully back into the bed, the sheets loose around her ankles and legs. Mordred was asleep in his cradle a few feet away. She began to comb through her hair, pulling at the strands that had overnight become entangled or lax. Gems and beads fell into her palm as pomegranate seeds. Frik stirred beside her, awakened by the careless flight of Morgan's limbs. Tired, he moved languidly. A hand reached out to softly stroke and trace her back. \"My mothew used to bwush hew haiw like this evewy night befowe bed.\" She paused and lowered the comb, clutching it. \"I've been thinking of hew a lot lately. I miss hew.\" Mordred began to cry, and Frik placed a kiss on a bare shoulder before springing from the bed and to the cradle, scooping the boy up and into his arms and rocking him gently. The baby's wails increased until the gnome forwent any further attempts to soothe the child and promptly placed him on his mother's lap, as she'd urged. She wrapped her arms around Mordred, pressing her face into his crown of red hair, warming him with her breath and body; all with the hope that through such warmth her love would be transferred. Frik crawled into the bed behind her and began to weave the gems and trinkets back into her hair. He could have simply practiced magic to accomplish the task, but he found it more fun to do it the old-fashioned way. She had such soft hair. Morgan did what she could to calm her ill-tempered son. \"Mowdwed, Mowdwed. Hush now. Mummy's hewe. Mummy won't let anything huwt you. Thewe's no weason to cwy.\" She rocked the little boy and reached for some of the toys his Auntie Mab had given him a few nights before. Turning a cloth doll over in his hands, pulling at its face and feet, he began to quiet. \"Thewe's a good boy.\" She picked up the brush she'd set aside and gently began to run it through Mordred's short curls. \"My mothew would have loved you, Mowdwed. And I think you would have liked hew, too. Auntie Mab and Uncle Fwik, well, they'we not at all the same as hew... I'm not even like hew.\" Morgan sighed and looked to the distance, to the sunlight on a wall. \"I wondew what she would think of me now...\" ~o~ A small hand weakly grasped at the feather quills of the wizard's cloak. Merlin smiled looking down at the sweet, newly born face. To think so small a creature held in that same fragile hand the fate of England. Being near Arthur, stealing him away from the darkness of Tintagel, Merlin felt happier than he had in years. Goodness would prosper from this day on. The land and its people would be reborn. \"Arthur,\" he said the name aloud to reaffirm the truth to himself, to feel wash over him the pride in knowing this was the first time he would say Arthur's name for the rest of his life. He already felt as though Arthur was almost the same as his son, though he wouldn't raise him. No, he couldn't raise him, not with Mab always interfering. What had happened to his mother, Ambrosia, Nimue... All the people he came to love were at risk. He'd seen in a vision the couple who would raise Arthur, and though it pained him, he knew he must part with the child. It would be in the best interests of all those involved. It was for the sake of the people of Britain. He recalled the visions he'd had of Arthur as a man, a head of wild blond hair and equally unruly beard. He'd seen him sitting behind a great round table, surrounded on all sides by his loyal knights and friends. Merlin couldn't help but grin. Though, in an instant, his pride shifted to a form of gladness as he became transfixed by an image of Nimue. He saw her tending to a babe he knew wasn't Arthur. This child was his with Nimue, a daughter born with her mother's kind smile and his eyes. In seconds he saw the infant age into a child, walking through the forest between himself and Nimue. Then as a young adult he watched as she bundled herbs and tied them to the walls of Ambrosia's cottage. She was clever and beautiful, as most evoked phantoms are. This wasn't a vision from the future, but a dream spun of his own desires. He closed his eyes. As the world disappeared so too did his fantasy. It vanished with the wind, like so many of his dreams. If only he and Nimue could lead such a life together, but it wasn't to be, not while Mab still gained strength. ~o~ \"Auntie Mab, would you tell me again how you convinced King Vortigern to offer the wizard's woman to the great dragon?\" Mab's eyes narrowed. \"I've told you that story many times, Mordred.\" \"I know. But I do so love how you tell it; I always feel as though I'm there with you, right by your side.\" A faint smile appeared on her lips, and she turned her head in such a way to indicate his words had given her a unique energy. She resettled into her chair. \"I wish you could have been, my sweet.\" She gripped his wrist, and he could feel her pulse through their crossed flesh. \"But we'll soon make up for all of that you missed. What fun we'll have once you're king.\" The boy and his aunt gave as little consideration as possible to the Lady of Cornwall and her miscast lover as they dazedly entered the main hall. They'd apparently slept in the secluded hay loft to the side of the hall. Strands of straw clung to their hair and bodies. \"Without them,\" she hissed in his ear. \"Yes. What fun.\" A mischievous spark lit behind Mordred's eyes, and as it was made known to Mab, she willfully took hold of its offered rope and tugged at its frayed end. She moved her own gaze toward the other signs of life, as a means of communicating to Mordred that this game should continue from here on purely in thought. Her hands swam over his shoulder, the ends of his hair. The eyes and face of his aunt glistened in the dim light. \"I see you two awe up alweady,\" said Morgan. \"Yes, mother. We've been awake for positively ages, haven't we, Auntie Mab?\" \"Yes. Ages, my sweet.\" \"And while you were busy sleeping the day away, Mother, Auntie Mab and I have been having a nice chat about the past - and the future. Planning dear Merlin's downfall.\" He leaned back and stretched his legs. \"How I look forward to making sure he's wasted his entire life.\" \"That day can't come soon enough,\" Morgan said. She and Frik were standing beside a brazier, hands outstretched as they warmed themselves. \"If only I'd been oldew. If only I'd had magic, I could have stopped Uthew. My mothew and my fathew would still be hewe if it wewen't fow Mewlin.\" Mordred sighed loudly. \"Really Mother, must you go on about this again?\" \"I've a wight to! You've not lost anyone, Mowdwed. You've been lucky. I lost both of my pawents within a yeaw of each otheu. I gwew up alone.\" \"There, there, my dear.\" Frik patted and clasped her hand. The boy turned his face in disgust. The Fae Queen's voice issued from her corner in the shadows. \"This is exactly the sort of thing I've spoken to you about. Merlin behaves as though his cause his just and good. That he's above making such \"immoral\" decisions, but in the end he's no different. If anything, he's worse!\" \"Hear, hear! Well said, Auntie Mab. The fool clearly doesn't think about the repercussions of his actions. No, not while he's too busy thinking of revenge.\" \"Ow his own gain,\" added Morgan. \"Yes. Well, I mean, Master Merlin has always been rather stubborn,\" Frik said. \"Once he gets something in his mind... Well, there's just no going back. He had such potential. It's such a shame he didn't develop his abilities to their greatest extent.\" \"I would have if I'd been him.\" Morgan examined her nails. \"Who wouldn't? I love what magic's done fow me.\" \"Merlin could have been unstoppable,\" Mab's voice took on a softer tone. \"When he was created, I saw so much power in him.\" \"That there is something of you in him is his only redeeming quality, Auntie. Though, in all honesty, it's hard to see him being related to you at all.\" \"My mistake was in letting that woman raise him. She corrupted him.\" \"It's not any fault of yours,\" Mordred remarked, \"You couldn't have known she would raise him in such ignorance.\" He returned to his aunt's side after sullenly pacing the main hall. \"As I can recall, I afterwards, on more than one occasion, offered to help raise the lad... He was such an enduring creature in his infancy.\" \"I happen to think Fwik makes quite a wondewful fathew. He did so well helping me with Mowdwed.\" Mab continued, ignoring them. \"That woman did everything in her power to defy me! And you can see how much sway she continues to hold over him.\" Mordred, always eager to please, chimed in. \"From what I've heard of the wizard, he claims to act on behalf of those who have been wronged when in reality he's simply motivated by his own designs. And Arthur, his doting little instrument... Always doing just as he's told. Prey tell, where is the logic in raising a king to do all your bidding when Merlin himself should simply have found a way to take the crown? We all know that no man will ever be as good and pure as the wizard is in his own mind.\" \"He could have saved us all a lot of heawtache if he'd done just that and become king. But then, we'd have to live with him wuling the land.\" Morgan's face displayed her displeasure with the idea. \"We live with that as it is,\" said Mordred. \"Arthur is king in name only, as he's been away for years. And we can assume every decision made by the Queen and her plaything is first approved by Merlin.\" \"If I could have changed his mind, I think he would have made a very good king. It was something I wanted, in the beginning,\" Mab confessed. \"But you can see how that has turned out.\" \"I'll be twice the king Merlin could have been,\" Mordred swore. He was forever jealous of the way in which Queen Mab seemed to fixate on her other creation, no matter how often she told Mordred that he was her favorite. To his satisfaction, Mab brought her hand once more to his shoulder, stroking it and his long hair. \"I know you will, my sweet. I can almost taste the blood you will shed in my name.\" ~o~ ","Summary":" A/N: Some content is based on the Merlin novelizations by James Mallory.

April... Oops! So, this is meant to be a story about the history between Queen Mab and Ambrosia, from Ambrosia's perspective. It DOES contradict the part in the novels where Ambrosia notes that she hadn't seen Queen Mab since she was a child first serving at her shrine, prior to Merlin's birth. However, it always seemed from the scene in both the film and books that there was a bit more history there than that, and that the two of them had definitely encountered each other before on a few occasions. They're too familiar with each other for that to have been their first \"proper\" meeting, I think. I found Mab quite hard to write in this fic as in the earlier parts I was trying to write her with her Maiden and Mother aspects, whereas by the time the story is set she's basically lost those parts of herself – so yeah, apologies if these earlier parts didn't come off too well, but as with the previous challenge I wanted to actually get around to posting it rather than holding off indefinitely. Feedback is welcome! The first time Ambrosia meets Queen Mab, she is a child. She is the youngest of nine, short and scrawny, with a widowed mother too harried by her large family to pay her youngest any mind, or to protect her from being picked on by her older siblings. One day, after her older brother has said something particularly cruel to her, she had run out of the house in tears. In her distress, she hasn't really been paying attention to where she has been going, and so when the indignant childhood adrenaline runs out, and her legs begin to hurt, she stops outside an unfamiliar cave. She peers inside hesitantly, and gasps at the beautiful carving adorning the back wall of the cave. It is not unusual to find shrines to Queen Mab in hidden places like this, but she has never seen one this intricate and stunning. Staring around and finding no-one else nearby, she scurries up closer and stares up at the triple goddess. The Maiden looks as though she is laughing – her hair hangs loose and a crown of flowers sits atop her head. Ambrosia doesn't quite trust her – she reminds her too much of a prettier version of Ambrosia's own oldest sister, all too ready to tell her how young she is, what a fool she is, what a bother... The Warrior, Mab-Morrigan, makes Ambrosia shiver a little – her gaze is hard, there is a sword dripping blood in her hand and a raven perched on her shoulder. It is the last figure, the Mother, that Ambrosia lingers on. Her hair is gathered up in a more practical style, like her own mother. But she has wise eyes and a kind smile, her hand stretching out as if to pull a child into an embrace. This wasn't a mother who would brush her off, who was too busy with work and eight other other children to ever pay attention to Ambrosia. The child reaches out to touch the carved folds of the figure's skirt, and sniffles sadly to herself. \"Why are you crying, Ambrosia?\" The skin on her arms prickles – Ambrosia doesn't know quite why – and she turns to face the strange, whispering voice, only to be confronted by the same woman made flesh – Queen Mab, in her Mother aspect. She whirls from Mab to the statue and back again in amazement. She has never imagined that Mab would appear to her. She thinks that perhaps she should bow, or kneel, or at least say something … holy? But then Mab reaches out her arms to her, like her statue, and Ambrosia flings herself at the goddess and wraps her arms around her waist, sobbing into her dress. Mab rests a hand under her chin and tilts her head up so that the goddess can look her in the eye. \"There now...\" Her voice is strange, otherworldly, but Ambrosia finds it soothing for all that, \"Why did you call out to me?\" \"I didn't mean to!\" Ambrosia replies through her hiccups, \"But my brother... he stole my food and pushed me over. Then when I cried he said I was stupid.\" She continues dejectedly, \"And my mother doesn't care. I tried to tell her, and she just said not to bother her. I was hungry , and he wouldn't give me any food, and then he said I was useless and if I starved to death it would mean the rest of them would get more to eat.\" She has recounted all of this in a rush, and it is only afterwards that she thinks that perhaps this is not the sort of thing that goddesses are supposed to be summoned for. She releases Mab's skirts quickly and steps backwards, \"Am I in trouble? I didn't mean to summon you, I was just looking at the carvings...\" Mab smiles kindly, \"No, Ambrosia, you are not in trouble. In fact, I have a gift for you.\" She snaps her fingers, and suddenly a plate of bread and cheese and fruit appears before her, along with a cup of watered wine. Mab gestures at it, \"For you.\" Ambrosia gasps, for it is a finer meal than she can ever remember eating in her life, but at another nod from Mab, she falls on it hungrily, momentarily forgetting her sadness. \"Thank you, Queen Mab.\" She is only two mouthfuls into the meal when she hears her brother's voice distantly calling her name. Perhaps her mother had forced him to come out looking for her after all? If so, Ambrosia wishes that she hadn't, for he will only steal her food and tell her whole family about this beautiful cave with the carvings and the goddess and then it won't be her secret any more. Her face falls. Mab glances at her curiously, and then at the boy who appears in the mouth of the cave a moment later. \"Ambrosia!\" He sounds cross, \"You stupid... Oh,\" he sees Mab sitting behind his sister, \"Who are you?\" Mab raises an eyebrow and doesn't reply, turning to Ambrosia instead, which makes the child feels somewhat smug in itself, \"Is this your brother?\" Ambrosia nods, \"Yes,\" she replies sullenly. \"Hmmmm...\" Mab muses, \"Perhaps I should put a curse on him? What would you choose, Ambrosia?\" Her brother's eyes widen, \"C-curse? What? No!\" He seems to finally recognise Mab from the carving behind her and he has gone as white as snow. \"No? Well then...\" Mab doesn't move a muscle, but suddenly a flurry of grit and pebbles flies from deeper inside the cave, pelting the boy, \"... I suggest you leave.\" He turns and runs as fast as his legs will carry him. Mab exchanges a glance with Ambrosia and her eyes seem to glow orange. A moment later she hears her brother cry out as more pebbles pelt him on his way down the hill and across the fields. Ambrosia gasps and giggles in delight. Mab smiles indulgently down at her. \"Perhaps that will improve his disposition somewhat,\" she says drily, \"Though I'm afraid I can make no promises on that score.\" She turns back to Ambrosia, \"You should finish your meal.\" Ambrosia nods and tucks back in with gusto. \"I don't think he will like me any better. But he's never liked me anyway,\" she replies around a mouthful of food. \"Your brother is a fool,\" Mab replies simply, \"You have a look of destiny about you, Ambrosia. I cannot predict the future, but I daresay we will meet again one day.\" \"Really?\" Ambrosia asks, swallowing her last mouthful of food and turning to face Mab with wide eyes. \"Perhaps, when you're older.\" Mab stands as if to leave, \"For now, you should go home. And remember, should your family prove … unsatisfactory... there is always a place for you among the faithful.\" Ambrosia stands too. She turns to leave, and then on a whim, whirls around to wave Mab goodbye. Mab seems somewhat surprised by this, but nevertheless she raises a hand in return to Ambrosia as she vanishes in a flicker of light. Ambrosia runs home with a full stomach and a smile on her face, and a new and unshakeable determination to serve the lovely goddess from the cave when she is older. Until then, she will visit the cave with the carving every day to remind herself, even though it is many years until she sees Mab again in the flesh. The second time Ambrosia meets Queen Mab, she is a young priestess. It is autumn – harvest time – and she is bringing an offering of fine baked bread and fruits to Mab's shrine. She touches her triskelion necklace, mutters a prayer and lays the basket carefully down before the carving of her goddess. It is not so fine a likeness as the one in the secret cave of her childhood, but it is similar enough to remind her of the day in the cave that set her on this path to serve Mab, and the memories warm her heart. When she stands, she gasps and jumps backwards to find that there is another woman in the shrine with her, standing in the shadows. The other woman laughs. \"Am I so terrifying to you, loyal one?\" She steps forward out of the shadows, and it seems to Ambrosia that the sunlight rushes to embrace her, shining on her pure, white dress and pale skin. \"Lady,\" she breathes, and falls down again to her knees, \"Queen Mab. I am sorry. You startled me.\" \"You may rise.\" Mab's voice sounds amused, and Ambrosia scrambles to her feet, feeling rather foolish. To see Queen Mab again was, after all, why she had become a priestess in the first place, she should not have been so surprised that it was so. \"You are new to this shrine, are you not? I haven't seen you here before.\" \"Yes, Lady,\" Ambrosia replies firmly, pleased that she manages not to stammer this time. Then, more boldly, \"But I have met you before.\" \"Yes, I remember,\" Mab replies, \"I do not forget a face so quickly, particularly such a pretty one.\" The words are spoken lightly, but they cause Ambrosia to blush down to her toes. \"And it seems I was right after all. Perhaps Lord Idath should set aside that cauldron of his and simply ask me to tell the future for him. You have grown a great deal since I saw you last, Ambrosia.\" \"We humans do, my Queen.\" Ambrosia says. Once again she continues without thinking, \"You have changed a great deal too.\" For now she is clad in her role as the Maiden. Her magnificent hair hangs loose, inky blacks waves framing her face and gleaming white dress, tangled around the crown of wheat and wildflowers that she wears on her head. Even though her features haven't really changed, she looks younger, more Ambrosia's own age, her eyes sparkling with mirth rather than motherly wisdom. Ambrosia scolds herself internally for ever thinking to compare Mab to her sister, for truly, she is stunning beyond anything the young priestess has ever seen. \"Not changed. I am as ever I have been and ever will be,\" Mab replies, gesturing at herself, \"I merely change which aspect I choose to embody.\" \"Of course, my lady,\" Ambrosia replies quickly, not wanting Mab to think she is some fool girl that has turned to the priesthood for food and the reverence of the common people and hasn't even bothered to learn about the gods that she follows. Ambrosia had known a few girls like that when she was in training. Most of them hadn't made it to the rank of full priestess, and if she'd had any say in it, none of them would. \"It's just that I've always remembered you as the Mother, all these years.\" \"It was the form that you wanted to see the most, I think.\" Mab said, gesturing to the carving beside her, \"Sometimes the situation calls for the Mother, and sometimes it calls for me as I am now.\" \"And sometimes the Warrior,\" Ambrosia adds, then cringes internally, \"Fool girl, you think she can't remember her own aspects?!\" Mab tilts her head to one side and quirks her mouth slightly in a half smile. \"Yes...\" she draws the word out, \"And the Warrior. Were you hoping to meet the Morrigan, rather than me, Ambrosia?\" \"No, my Queen!\" Ambrosia blurts out, not wanting Mab to think her ungrateful for appearing to her again, for fulfilling her deepest wish. \"I mean... of course, we would be honoured to receive a visit from any of your aspects, including the Morrigan, whichever you choose. I mean, we are honoured... I... I am making a damned fool of myself, aren't I?\" she finishes, noticing that Mab is trying not to laugh, and only barely succeeding. \"I have known several fools, Ambrosia, and you don't strike me as one of them. Well...\" Mab trails off mock doubtfully towards the end of her sentence. Ambrosia laughs at that, beginning to find herself more at ease with Mab's company, \"Anyway, as you say, it is my choice which aspect to appear in. I have been the Warrior too often of late. Tonight, I choose the Maiden.\" Her eyes darken somewhat, \"If these Christians don't leave my country soon, you will likely get your chance to see me as the Morrigan.\" She shakes her head and the cloud vanishes as soon as it came, \"That is a matter for another day.\" \"And how may I serve you on this day, Lady?\" \"I think that today, Ambrosia, I would like to celebrate the Harvest in your company.\" Mab links her arm with Ambrosia's, and turns to face her with a mischievous look in her eyes, \"As for how you can serve me, Ambrosia – food of the gods - let's start with a kiss, shall we, and see where we go from there?\" She laughs again as Ambrosia's face turns red and she is left wordless. Ambrosia sees Mab many times after that, as the years pass and she grows into a confident and practical woman, rather than the youth that had stumbled over her words that first day in the shrine. For all that, the sight of Queen Mab still has the power to momentarily rob her of speech and thought. Her Queen appears sporadically- sometimes only a few days after her last visit, sometimes letting months drift by before she appears again. Ambrosia doesn't mind. It is enough to know that Mab will return. Mab's frequent appearances to Ambrosia have been noted. She is seen as one of the Queen's favoured – and she knows that she is \"one of the favoured\", rather than \"the only favoured\", and she doesn't mind that either. Mab is not human, and she does not see the world as humans do, see life as something to be shared with only one. It is enough to know that Mab does care for her, however many others she cares for too. Mab always appears to Ambrosia in her Maiden aspect, youthful and quick limbed and drawn to joy. She laughs and dances around the bonfires that the druids and priestesses build to honour her visits, she smiles graciously as the younger initiates bring her gifts and sing and dance in her honour. Occasionally she reminisces about days of old – once, she tells Ambrosia, when the Romans had first begun to convert to this new religion and had declared war upon the gods of Britain, they had captured Romans and burned them in a wicker man as a sacrifice to the very gods they hated. Mab looked somewhat nostalgic at the thought – Ambrosia had quietly and drily noted that it sounded like a very inefficient way of getting rid of the Christians. \"Mmm, yes,\" Mab had replied, \"There is something to be said for efficiency. Though I would prefer if there was less need for it.\" In quieter moments, she draws Ambrosia away through the woods and shows her the locations of other shrines and carvings, of trees and rocks and animals imbued with Old Magic. There are fewer of them than there used to be, Mab muses. In quieter moments yet, she teaches Ambrosia some different lessons altogether. The Maiden may be her aspect, but not, it appears, by every definition. Ambrosia welcomes Mab's touch, her lips, her mouth... She knows that she will never share what others share with their lovers – marriage, a home, children, or even simply waking up in each other's arms every morning. But she also knows that those others will not see a goddess in her softest moments, will not literally feel the magic that courses through the world running through their entire body, and so she feels that it is a fair trade. Mab hasn't appeared to her in her Mother aspect for years - \"I do not think you want me as a mother any more, sweet one,\" she had noted drily that last time the subject had come up, and in truth, she was right. Ambrosia was a grown woman now, and though she loves Mab as entirely as she ever had when she was a child, it is no longer that part of her that calls to Ambrosia. Nor has Ambrosia ever seen Mab's warrior aspect- the Morrigan. She knows that Mab takes on this form more often than not – more and more the Christians spread their intolerance across the land, more and more those faithful to the Old Ways must rise against them. But this shrine is far from King Constant and his armies, and whenever Mab appears here, she is the Maiden once more. Ambrosia wonders if this is something of an escape for her. The first time Ambrosia encounters Mab in her final aspect, she nearly dies. She is one of the most senior priestesses at the shrine by this time. The others look to her for guidance. And so, when one of them spots Constant's men riding in fast from the east, they come running to Ambrosia, in the hope that she will know what to do. She runs out and peers down the hill at the soldiers heading towards them, and can tell them nothing but \"Run.\" She runs around the collection of small buildings near the shrine, hammering on the doors to wake the others. By the time she turns back to the shrine, the first horses are almost upon them. Ambrosia only has time to clutch her necklace and mutter a fevered prayer as one rides straight at her, sword raised. And then, salvation. Screaming warriors charging up the hill, wearing pagan symbols painted upon their bodies and shields. And in their midst, a woman with long black hair that Ambrosia barely glimpses, but knows must be Mab. The soldier before her hesitates, as his horse bucks and tries to turn away from the onrushing charge – he eventually brings it under control, but his only reward is to be the first one cut down. The Christians begin to turn and run – they may be mounted, but they are also outnumbered. A few attempt to stay and fight, and some of the pagan warriors fall to their blades – but then their horses are cut out from under them, and they tumble to the ground to be impaled by the blades and spears of their enemies. More warriors chase after those who flee. Most of them are able to ride away, but others still fall. Ambrosia watches, frozen in place, as the warriors let out a cheer. Most of them follow their comrades down the hill to watch Constant's men retreat, leaving bodies in their wake. The ground is stained red with blood. She takes a moment to collect herself, then turns to the younger priestesses, gives them instructions to gather up the pagan dead and prepare the bodies for funeral rites. \"And the Christians?\" one of them asks. Ambrosia pauses a moment. \"Pile them at the bottom of the hill with the others,\" she sighs, \"We'll have to decide what to do with them later.\" It is only after the priestesses run about their preparations that Ambrosia goes to find Mab. It is not hard – she stands glaring down at the body of one of Constant's soldiers, her warriors keeping a respectful distance. As Ambrosia approaches, Mab turns, and she gets her first look at the Morrigan. Her hair hangs straight around her, hard lines more suited to this aspect than the soft waves she usually wears. Her dress is deep black, with feathers at the shoulder, as if to almost mimic the ravens that are beginning to gather above the bodies. And her eyes are hard, devoid of all of the spark and softness of her other two aspects. There is a spray of blood across her face – not hers, of course, simply a mark from where a soldier was cut down near her – but she makes no move to wipe it away, and in some macabre way, it suits her. She smiles coldly when she sees Ambrosia approach. \"I told you that you would see me one day, Ambrosia.\" Her voice is a hiss, as harsh as the cry of the ravens above. Ambrosia cannot help herself – she draws back slightly. Mab laughs, humourless, \"Are you afraid of me?\" \"No, Lady,\" Ambrosia replied, forcing her voice not to shake. Mab raises an eyebrow. \"Liar.\" She turns away, \"Your words are your bond, girl, you know that.\" \"I'm sorry, Queen Mab,\" Ambrosia replies, momentarily repentant, \"You're right. I am afraid of you. I didn't mean to cause offence- is it not the role of the Warrior to strike fear into the heart of mortals?\" Mab turns to face her and regards her coldly. \"It is the role of the Warrior to destroy my enemies, Ambrosia. To bring death to them. It is not me who nearly rode you down at the shrine – go and look upon him with fear, if you cannot look upon me at all, and stop wasting my time.\" \"That wasn't what I meant...\" Ambrosia says gently, going as if to touch Mab's arm. Mab hisses in fury and sends her falling backwards in a gust of air. Before she can pull herself up from the ground, Mab is standing over her. \"You serve me , Ambrosia, not the other way around. Do not think to take liberties simply because I have favoured you in the past. Others have tried, and they have found themselves my enemy – would you prefer to face the Morrigan as an enemy, when you can barely face me as your Queen?\" Ambrosia attempts a light tone, despite the hurt and the fear pulsing through her, \"I can think of worse ways to die.\" Mab raises an eyebrow and smirks coldly. \"Oh, so can I. I have quite the imagination.\" The threat hangs heavy in the air. Ambrosia takes a deep breath, \"All I meant, Lady was... You've been part of my life since I was a child. You've been a goddess, my Queen, my lover, my – my friend. Even a mother to me. What better way to die than at your hands?\" Mab growls, \"I am not your mother, Ambrosia. Or your friend.\" \"No,\" Ambrosia says, trying to be reasonable, trying to pull the conversation back onto safer ground, \"Not now. But you are not just the Warrior, you ARE the mother and the maiden too, I know that...\" Mab looks stricken for a moment, then turns away and snaps \"Leave me!\" Ambrosia is hurt, but she obeys, clambering to her feet and turning from the terrifying apparition before her, running back to the safety of the shrine. As she reaches the top of the hill she hears a dreadful caw-ing noise, and she turns back just in time to see the gathering ravens dive down as one black, feathered mass and begin to pick the flesh from the bones of Constant's dead men. They will need to abandon the shrine - to move to somewhere more hidden now that Constant's soldiers know where they are. She swiftly sets about ordering the other initiates to do just that, and when she returns to the battlefield later, to find Mab and try and apologise, Mab has already gone. Hours later, Ambrosia lifts her own pack of belongings and sets out with the others, away from the place that has been her home and happiness for the last fifteen years and more. It is years – decades, even – before Ambrosia begins to wonder if Mab was already losing her Maiden and Mother aspects then. Years pass, and Ambrosia doesn't see Mab again. She is too busy fighting the Christians to visit those who tend her shrines, if she celebrates her festivals at all Ambrosia believes she must celebrate them with her pagan warriors – celebrate between bloody battles. Or perhaps for the terrifying warrior aspect of Mab, the bloody battles are a celebration of their own. Images flicker across Ambrosia's mind of the Queen of the Old Ways dripping in Christian blood with ravens flying around her. She snorts and dismisses them as fancy. Once she could afford to let her imagination wander, these days the constant threat of war and influx of terrified worshippers means she has to be more practical. More years pass. The battles grow fiercer, and Mab still doesn't come back. At first, Ambrosia's prayers are steadfast, calm. She has faith that Mab will come to her eventually. She does not. Her prayers grow more fervent. She begins to believe that perhaps she has driven Mab away – that her fear of the Morrigan had hurt the Queen of the Old Ways. Please. Come back. I need you. WE need you. She still does not. Followers begin to drift away from Mab's shrines. They say that she doesn't care anymore. Better to join the Christians and pay lip service to their god than be slaughtered by them in the name of a goddess that has all but vanished. When she was young, Ambrosia would have been angry with them. Now her hair is turning to grey and her hands are calloused from hard work and she has long ago realised that Mab's leaving had nothing to do with her. Likely, Mab had never given Ambrosia's fear a second thought, a fleeting moment in eternity for her, another scared follower. In her own way, Mab is as inscrutable as the Christian's god, and just as different from her followers. Ambrosia can no longer blame them for choosing life over faith. Life is short, after all. Instead she steels her spine, gathers the druids and priestesses that remain at the shrine and puts them to work helping the sick and injured that still come to them. She will bring people back to Mab in her own way – by helping others. As the years go on, the sting of abandonment fades to a dull ache. Ambrosia works hard. She still tends the shrine, she still says her prayers, she still heals and blesses people in Mab's name. In her heart, she knows that she may never see Mab again – or at least, if she does, it will never be as it was before. The world has changed too much, and so has she. But she still has faith that Mab does care, in some small way. When Vortigern appears on Britain's shores and cuts down Constant, Ambrosia knows instinctively that this is Mab's doing. Or the Morrigan's doing, at any rate – because the Mother, in her kindness and wisdom, and the Maiden in her love of her people, would have to know that unleashing a Saxon beast on the land will lead the land to ruin in the long term. And they would have been right – Ambrosia and her fellows no longer need to bother hiding from the Christians, for now they are all , Pagan and Christian alike, hiding from Vortigern. She knows that Mab would never have given her consent to this, surely she must have some plan to get rid of Vortigern as she finally succeeded in getting rid of Constant before him? The day Vortigern's men attack the shrine is when Ambrosia's faith finally breaks. She stands amongst the ruins of the shrine, and the bodies of her friends, and feels something inside her snap, faith and love turning to anger in an instant. She had done her best. They had all done their best. And Mab had abandoned them. Ambrosia does the same to her – throwing aside her triskelion, and forsaking the goddess she had vowed to serve above all others. And not, she thinks to herself, a moment too soon. The next time Ambrosia sees Mab is just over 9 months later. Had someone told her beforehand that her journey to Avalon is what would bring her face to face with her former Queen again, she would have laughed in their faces. But here they stand, Mab with her gnomish lackey in tow, and Ambrosia holding the child she had created in her arms. Fate, Ambrosia thinks tartly, has a terrible sense of humour. Mab looks as ageless as ever, but she has still changed. The kindness of the Mother, and the laughter of the Maiden, they are gone from her face. She is the Morrigan entirely now, and even when she stares at Merlin, even when she looks at Ambrosia, and her former priestess can see that she wants to draw on her other aspects, she cannot. It is as if part of her has died. Even through her anger, Ambrosia pities her, even with Elissa dying beside them and the memories of the massacred shrine, part of her wants to embrace Mab as though she was still young and Mab was still whole. But there is more at stake than the two of them now – a tiny child now held in Mab's arms, and Ambrosia knows too well that the part of Mab that had comforted her as a child, and that could have raised Merlin and shown him how she loved him was gone. She made a promise to Elissa. And so she holds Merlin in her arms, and this time it is her who sends Mab away. The last time Ambrosia meets Mab is almost 20 years later. She is an old, old woman, and her body is failing. She knows that she is dying, and all she hopes is that she sees Merlin one last time before she makes the journey to the Summer Land. Had Ambrosia known when she was younger that she would see more of Mab after leaving the Old Ways than in the 20 years beforehand, she would probably have left much sooner, she thinks with a smirk. Though, Mab is furious, and does a poor job at containing it – young Ambrosia would sooner have cut off her own foot than made Mab so angry, so perhaps not. As it is, Ambrosia-the-old-woman rather enjoys rattling Mab further. She feels that she has earned it, after a lifetime spent serving her in one way or another, and decades of disappointment. And what can Mab do, after all, but kill her a few hours early? Ambrosia remembers the first time she met the Morrigan. And after all these years she has not forgotten that fleeting thought and those awkward stumbling words, I can think of worse ways to die. Before Merlin had come into her life, Mab had been the very centre of her existence. In some ways, she still was – Merlin's mother, the one who had allowed Ambrosia to raise him, antagonistic now but still a force in her life. And perhaps she would still rather die at her hands, for she continues to wind Mab up – and when she refuses to send Merlin back to her, that is the final straw. Mab's scream sends air spinning around the hut. Ambrosia is struck by flying debris, but she cannot seem to feel it. She is not sure if it is the spell sucking away her energy, or simply her failing heart finally giving out. As she falls to the bench beside her, she hears Mab go quiet, and then come over and stare at her in puzzlement. Ambrosia fancies there is a flicker of concern there, too. She chuckles to herself. Well, Ambrosia, you got your wish in the end ... Hope you all enjoyed! Just … one and a half months behind now. Dammit! ","Summary":" OK, so this was attempt number 2 at the February Challenge prompt for the 20 th Anniversary Fanwork"},{"Movie":"Merlin","Title":"Cousin","Author":"CiderDrinker","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12828129","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Posted as my entry for the 20th Anniversary Merlin Fanwork challenge, prompt \"Family\". Posted here and to AO3. This takes place a few days before Mordred and Arthur first meet, in terms of canon timeline. Merlin was tired. It had been a long day. Guinevere was moping over the loss of Lancelot. Perhaps moping was the wrong word. She was sad, she was lonely, but she was also angry. She blamed Merlin – perhaps not entirely wrongly. He had been harsh on her – she was young, intelligent, fierce, and not the kind of person who could live a life devoted to an absent husband who she barely knew. Arthur's knights respected Guinevere, for the most part- she had been their queen and ruler for the last decade. But even they had their suspicions about the nature of the relationship between the queen and her now-absent champion. Lancelot's sudden disappearance didn't do much to dampen their suspicions, it looked too much like guilt. They blamed Merlin, too – and perhaps they weren't wrong either. Merlin had chosen Lancelot as Arthur's champion, after all. Perhaps some of them thought he was reaching too high for a pagan wizard, trying to seek power in Arthur's absence. Merlin wasn't given to praying – he had seen enough terrible things in his life to struggle to believe in any kind of benevolent unseen god, and the ones he had seen certainly weren't inclined to benevolence, or making Merlin's life in any way easier – but if he was, he would have prayed for Arthur's return. The country needed to remember it's king. Guinevere needed a husband in more than just name. And more than that, Merlin missed his friend. Pushing open the door of his small house on the outskirts of Camelot, Merlin realised almost immediately that someone had been there in his absence. The scuffs in the dirt of the floor, the books on the shelf that had been placed back carelessly and in the wrong order. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up, in the way that he associated with magic. \"Mab.\" He spoke through gritted teeth. There was a snort of laughter from the shadows in the corner of the room – a man's laughter. He waved a hand, bathing the room in sudden, brilliant light and illuminating the young man that stood there. \"No, not Mab. Just me, cousin.\" There was a sneer in the young man's voice. The address threw Merlin for a moment, for he was certain he had never seen this man before, and he knew nothing of any relatives on his birth mother's side. Then it hit him – his hair had grown out, and grown darker, but it was still curled and tinged with a hint of reddish brown, like his mother's. He didn't have magic himself, but he was surrounded by it, power draped around him like a fine cloak – Mab's magic. His \"aunt\"'s magic. \"Mordred.\" The man gave a slightly mocking bow. \"Oh, so the great and mighty king's wizard does recognise me after all. Such an honour.\" \"You've changed a great deal since the last time I saw you.\" Merlin stared at the young man – he knew that he would grow fast, but he had hoped that there would be more time before he was old enough to come to Camelot, time for Arthur to return, for the kingdom to be more stable. \"Yes,\" Mordred replied carelessly, \"In many ways. My aim is better now.\" His hand strayed to the knife at his belt. Merlin gestured sharply, and the knife flew out of Mordred's belt and across the room. Mordred watched it go and chuckled slightly, before turning back to Merlin and clapping slowly. \"Oh, very well done.\" His voice was mocking, Merlin wondered briefly if the boy ever took genuine pleasure in anything, \"I'm sure that sort of trick must come in very useful in a court full of Christians – I imagine many of them would prefer to see you dead.\" Merlin's arm was still raised, ready to defend himself with magic if need be. \"What is it you want, Mordred?\" Surely Mab had not gone to all this trouble to raise Arthur's son and speed his growth only to throw him into some futile attempt to kill her older creation. Mordred waved his hand, walking over to one of Merlin's chairs and sitting in it, \"Oh, I haven't come to kill you, if that's what you're wondering. Auntie Mab doesn't want you dead , cousin, though you have been such a terrible disappointment to her.\" He lounged back in the chair, putting his feet up on the small table. \"No, I just wanted to meet you. I thought it would be fun to catch up, get to know my predecessor. My only real family in Camelot, until father dearest returns.\" Merlin stared at him, one eyebrow raised. \"Really?\" he replied drily. Truth be told, he had only ever thought of Mordred in terms of his relationship to Arthur – the illegitimate son, the source of shame – it had never really occurred to him that Mordred was his family too, in a way. \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Mordred, but if you're hoping for family stories I will have to disappoint you. Mab and I have never been close. And since Morgan and Arthur conceived you, I'm not so sure that I would call us cousins, either.\" Mordred's mock-friendly expression dropped slightly – but only just. \"Come, come now Merlin. Auntie Mab created you. You owe your entire existence to her. She is your mother. And through her magic, she created me too, gave me more than that pair of fools could have alone. Think – she and I are the only family you have left.\" \"Mab is not my family. Mab destroyed my family.\" Merlin replied coldly. \"You are a fool,\" Mordred snapped, \"Auntie Mab gave you gifts that anyone with sense would kill for. She would have given you the throne if you'd had the stomach to reach out and take it, instead of crawling around for my father.\" Merlin fixed Mordred with a glare, \"I've known your father since childhood. He is a good man. A good king. I am proud to serve him.\" \"Arthur is a weakling,\" Mordred replied, just as coldly, \"He was weak when he slept with my mother. He was weak when he fled the country with his tail between his legs.\" Merlin stared at Mordred again. He wanted to see something, anything of Arthur in the man before him, of a son that his king could be proud of. But there was nothing – Mordred was handsome, as his father was, but it must have come from either Morgan's side or from Mab's magic, for hardly any of the features were the same. And his smile – that was entirely Mab's, that smirk. Though on Mordred it looked different, less natural, as though he had practised long and hard to match his auntie's smile. \"Arthur is on a quest, Mordred. You may not believe in anything bigger than yourself and Mab's ambitions, but he does. Doing what he believes is right is not fleeing.\" \"Oh, he was fleeing,\" Mordred took his feet from the table and leaned his arms on it instead, tilting himself towards Merlin, who was careful to stay out of arm's reach, \"He fled with the hounds of hell on his heels – that's what he believes, isn't it? That he committed sins when he lay with my mother – incest, lustfulness, adultery. And of course, he can't actually admit to then, because then that would have left his rule in jeopardy, and his illegitimate, incest-born, pagan son as his one and only heir. But he has to do something to stop his soul burning in the ever-after, doesn't he? So,\" he gestured widely, \"Off he runs on a grand quest, to drink from a cup and gain his god's pleasure. Never mind his kingdom. Never mind his queen. Never mind his son. We have all been left to get along without him.\" Merlin stared at Mordred, feeling a small pang of pity for the angry young man across from him. Little though Merlin liked to admit it, Mordred had a point, \"I'm sorry, Mordred. Perhaps Arthur did wrong you. Perhaps we both did, for leaving you at Tintagel.\" Mordred stared at Merlin as though he was quite stupid, \"Oh, dear, cousin – you think I regret my father's abandoning me?\" He snorted, \"He has nothing I want but his kingdom – and his blood is all I require for that, not his presence in my childhood. I had Auntie Mab – I didn't need your precious Arthur.\" \"Mab is poisonous, allowing her near you is perhaps the greatest wrong your mother has done.\" \"Well, Merlin, entertaining as it is to hear you berate my mother on her wrongs – you should have heard what she would say about you – I can assure you there is no need to trouble yourself on that question any longer. My mother is beyond earthly concerns now.\" Merlin blinked. \"Morgan is dead?\" \"Mmm, indeed.\" Mordred shrugged this information off as though it meant nothing to him. \"It's just me and Auntie now.\" His eyes lit up at the end of that sentence. Merlin sighed, \"If you had any sense, you would get away from her.\" \"If you had any sense,\" Mordred snapped, \"You would appreciate all that she has done for you. She made you, gave you power, would have given you more. But you were too weak to take it. Well... that doesn't matter now. Now, she has me – and I assure you that I am not too weak.\" \"You are dancing to Mab's tune,\" Merlin replied angrily, \"If you see anything other than unquestioning obedience as weakness, then I pity you.\" \"I don't want your pity,\" snarled Mordred, slamming his fists against the table. Merlin heard the sounds of wood splintering. Mordred sat back, rubbing his hand thoughtfully, pulling his expression back under control, \"And there is a great deal that I question. For example: after all you've done, why doesn't Auntie Mab want you dead? You are nothing but a nuisance to her plans. She has me now. So I came to see for myself – what is it about you that makes her want to keep you alive?\" Merlin almost choked on his own surprise. For the first time all evening, it felt as though Mordred was actually being genuine. He didn't want to know more about his father, or punish Merlin for keeping him away from Camelot. This wasn't about Arthur at all. \"That's what all this is about? Jealousy? Over Mab?\" Merlin didn't know whether to laugh or cry – laugh because it seemed ludicrous and cry because if nothing else, this proved that Mordred was completely Mab's creature. Mordred shrugged, \"I can't say that this visit has been terribly enlightening. If there's a use to keeping you alive, I certainly don't see it. Auntie's not given to sentimentality. But apparently, for you she's willing to make an exception.\" His fingers were digging into the table, leaving crescent shaped marks, \"You're her precious pet wizard, you were her first hope. You were hers , I'm just Arthur's.\" \"Well if it makes you feel any better, and keeps me from losing my table, then let me assure you: She's all yours,\" Merlin replied drily, \"For all the good it will do you. Mab brings harm to all that she touches, Mordred, and for the life of me I cannot tell whether it is always on purpose or not.\" Mordred took his hands away from the table, carefully, \"You speak as though I need your permission, cousin. As though this is something for you to give, not something for me to take.\" \"I thought you said you weren't going to kill me, Mordred.\" Merlin spoke evenly. He still pitied the boy, but that did not mean he wouldn't defend himself if the need arose. And from the burning dislike in Mordred's eyes, he was beginning to suspect that it would. \"I said that I didn't come here to kill you. And that Auntie Mab didn't want you dead. That's not quite the same thing. Oh, but don't worry cousin. You're safe for now.\" Mordred began to rise, \"I'm nothing if not thorough. First, you'll see your precious Arthur die. Then his loyal knights go up in flames.\" He brushed some splinters of wood off his fine clothes, \"And then,\" he glanced back at Merlin, his Mab-smile back in place, \" Then it's time to wipe the Christians off the shores of Britain. Perhaps I'll start with Avalon. Perhaps I'll start with... what was her name? Oh, that's right. Nimue. By the sounds of it, she should be quite easy to find. Or perhaps I'll just feed them all to dragons, and save myself the trouble.\" Merlin stood to face Mordred, his own eyes flaming now, hands twitching as though with the urge to strangle Mordred where he stood. \"And when I've done all of this, when I've proven myself as her champion, do you really think that Auntie Mab won't grant me anything I wish? And that's when I'll kill you.\" \"And what if she doesn't,\" Merlin challenged, \"What if she never quite comes around to the idea? What if you always stay second best?\" It was spiteful, perhaps, but Mordred's threat to his own loved ones had given him the urge to hurt back. Mordred shrugged, \"Well, then I suppose I'll be king,\" He bent swiftly and scooped his dagger up from the floor where Merlin had flung it earlier, twirling it around in his fingers, \"And she'll need me even if I do kill you.\" He tucked the knife into his belt, and made his way out of the hut, waving carelessly at Merlin as he did so, \"It's been a pleasure catching up, cousin. I'll be seeing you again soon.\" Merlin watched him go, hands shaking, and not sure for a moment whether it was Mordred or Mab that he pitied more.

Morgan le Fay wound around herself, cocooned herself, in the notion of one day reigning over a kingdom that had designated a traitor as its king. She let a spool of her spirit and tenacity unfurl around her being. The finer threads were of her lineage, and they were unbreakable. Isolated within the stone walls of Tintagel, Morgan grasped at any hand that presented itself, made some promise of release, whether its source be darkness or light. Neither ever bothered to adhere to her, nor her they. She dipped her fingers and toes into collected pools of both over the years, painting herself with them. Yet she remained unharmed. She existed, impatient but reassured. She had faith enough in herself to know she would find a way to alter the future. She, unlike others, would do whatever was required of her. Tasting of her brother's flesh there was in her heart no repentance nor regret; only happiness. Prior to the act she showed no hesitance, asked but one question and the answer suited her. In the role of a mother, she was modeled after a faerie. The shadows of her eyes and heart were dusted with glitter. Her clothes and hair faintly bore similarities to the goddess whose magic helped create her son. She waited for the throne sealed in the image of a queen. She had faith she would one day become to others what she already knew she was inside. ~o~ In moments of loneliness or reflection, Nimue sometimes wished she would be sent visions such as those described in the Bible. Not for glory - but to keep as a secret all her own. The holy whispers of a saint. The reassurance that her actions were right and God's will. A hand to hold through the night. A peace to know through doubt and fear. The saints might now deliver unto her messages from God, but she was as deaf to them as she was blind, led only by her faith. Inside her heart there glowed a lantern of red embers. From this fiery pulse roots spread throughout her body, through the tunnels of her veins. Inside her, inside everyone, God resided within such temples. The temples of his creations. Connected to her as he was to all His creations, God knew Nimue as no other. He understood the makings of her entire mind and being. Never would she allow her faith to waver. Never would she make him suffer such a betrayal. She would bind herself to the Lord. Unite her body and soul to the immortality of marriage to God. Become a sister in the absence of all other family in her life. Left alone, set in place in Avalon. ~o~ Alone at night, Merlin revisited the time he'd witnessed three faces beneath the water. The edifice of the Old Ways had been so lifelike, it had required no effort to imagine himself reaching into the pool and helping the Fae woman step into the world. The Maiden who awoke in him a previously unknown desire, the Warrior who had fought many battles, the Mother whose heart sang with praise. He pictured a mixture of three brought into the open, her dark hair braided with raven feathers; wildflowers, jeweled pins made in the shapes of stars. Her features wise, youthful, wet and glistening in the sun. He thought of the curve of her skull; her cheekbones, her eyes. Seeing how beautiful they appeared to him carved in stone how might they be in flesh? To see her walking among mortals. To hear her voice. To touch her skin. It would be effortless, then, to believe in her. ~o~ ","Summary":" ~o~ As a child she was required to drag her body out from under the ashes of loss.

Look here she comes now Bow down and stare in wonder Oh how we love you No flaws when you're pretending - Evanescence Morgan had been getting ready for bed she had succeeded in her task of seducing Arthur and was now certain his seed had taken root inside of her. She looked at her reflection in the mirror admiring herself even in a simple nightgown she was beautiful - thanks to magick. She sat at the vanity table lifting her golden hairbrush, she'd often watched her mother brushing her hair at nights before bed, she mimicked the action but the brush yanked on her new thick tangles. 'Is something wrong my dear?' Mab rasped from the darkness watching her, she'd appeared from nowhere and was clasping a silver goblet bejewelled with glinting purple crystals a soft smoke blowing from it. Morgan jumped letting out a soft yelp dropping her brush and snapping round, she'd gotten used to Frik appearing at random, Mab was a different story entirely, this was the first time she'd saw the faery Queen but she knew who she was instantly. 'Queen Mab?' Morgan asked though it was more of a statement. 'Fwik did not tell me to expect you.' Mab was far more beautiful than Morgan had ever pictured in her dizziest daydreams and her rasping voice dripped with power. Morgan felt jealous she picked up hairbrush and turned back to the mirror watching Mab in the reflection. 'Frik was supposed to give you this unfortunately I could not locate him.' Well it would be unfortunate for Frik when Mab got her hands on him. The Queen crossed the room sitting the goblet on Morgan's dressing table. 'What is it?' Morgan wrinkled her nose looking at the smoking goblet. Mab gestured towards the cup. 'It is to speed up your pregnancy and ensure you give us a son.' she encouraged. Morgan eyed the drink suspiciously and frowned at the word \"us\" then shook her head. 'Thank you but I am in no wush, to speed things up and Im suwe it is going to be a boy. Fwik says kings and queens should always have food tasters, incase an enemy is twying to poison them.' she went back to trying to tame her wild mane. Mab's lips twitched into a smirk. 'Did he now?' she whispered more to herself her eyes flashed dangerously. Having been watching Morgan for sometime she was aware of how stubborn the young woman was so some persuasion would be in order. 'May I?' Mab extended her hand as she watched Morgan fight with a particularly tangled knot of curls. Morgan seemed uncertain at first but she nodded giving the brush to Mab. Mab gathered the locks back from her neck her fingers slightly grazing her pale skin, very slowly she began to run the brush through her hair. Morgan seemed to go into a daze she felt so relaxed she felt like her body was on fire with pleasure, she'd not experienced this with Arthur or even Frik this was different better than sex. Mab watched her continuing to stroke the brush through her hair glittering magick fell from the Queen's fingers she then started entwining her hair into a braid. 'I hope you do not think of me as the enemy Morgan.' Mab rasped. Morgan watched Mab in the mirror she couldnt quite remember why she felt envious before what was the fun of envying Queen Mab when you could desire her. 'Couse I dont think that.' she muttered dreamily. The Queen smiled continuing to very slowly braid Morgan's hair. 'You know I only want what is best for the child growing inside of you I want to help him become great, and strong. I would never try to poison you.' she promised. Morgan listened Mab's words seemed to echo, the room now seemed to be eminateing a faint golden light like she'd fallen into some sort of paradise. Her eyes flicked to the smoking goblet at Mab's words she didnt know why she didnt want to drink from it before, all she knew was she didnt want Mab to be offended. Slowly she reached for the goblet Mab eyeing her hand and watched as she brought it to her lips drinking the potion to the last dregs. 'That's it my sweet very good.' she whispered against the shell of her ear her index finger tenderly stroking her cheek. 'Now you must sleep and let my magick work.' she took her wrist and Morgan stood almost like a puppet then in a total dream like state floated to her feather bed. Mab watched her and blew out the candles in the room with one breath. Morgan began screaming in agony as the potion started to work. ","Summary":" And please do something about your hair.

Honoria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12348829","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ~oOo~ After parting from Morgan, the men of the camp and the last offerings of rare spices, silks, and jewels, Frik proceeded to slowly filter past the glowing tents of the valley, his cape billowing out behind him. Mirth was behind his eyes. His golden hair alight. Lit by the flames of candles, the tents shone out as though great lanterns with their vibrant red, dark gray, and orange canvases. Their cores of fire were from a distance the same as a multitude of scattered hearths. Entering one of the shelters, Frik found an unclaimed bed in a corner and settled into it, feeling drowsy in the newfound warmth. The majority of his evening had been spent under the cool dark sky speaking with soldiers. Men who, hours earlier, had feared that this day might be their last. In their elation they had shared with Frik stories of their previous battles. In their tales they exhibited selflessness, bravery and honor; traits mostly unknown to the often cowardly gnome. Despite his worldliness, his inhuman abilities, their candor made him faintly yearn to follow in their footsteps. To in some way know what the men, for all their valor, could only barely articulate. Embers of their conversations continued to stir in him, floating as cinders and ash to his belly. Soon the morning would be here with Morgan ready to leave. Arthur, this night, would be a memory. With that agreeable thought, he arranged himself more comfortably in his bed. The swaying flames of torches left stains on his field of vision, green-blue shadows. Outside, the fading voices of wandering soldiers mixed with the soft murmurs of insects. He thought of Queen Mab, how she would be pleased that things seemed to be going her way for once. It was a comfort to know there would be no rational reason for Her Majesty to punish him upon his return to her Palace. There was a sudden shift with the wind as, with his thought, Queen Mab eased into full being inches from his reclined form. The gnome hurriedly rose as the flashes of accompanying light faded around his mistress. \"All is as planned,\" she announced. Queen Mab removed a goblet of water from a table, overturning it and pouring its contents into thin air. The liquid magically became solid. She took into her hand the disc-shaped mirror she'd created and passed it to Frik, who cupped it in both palms. \"As you can see, Arthur required no persuasion.\" Morgan and Arthur were shown to him, their bodies lit by the candlelight of their tent. He could hear Morgan's voice and see her face with clarity. She did not seem uncomfortable with the role she was being made to perform. The image faded, leaving him unsettled. \"She's very convincing, isn't she?\" Mab observed, as if again sensing his thoughts. She, on a whim, suddenly transported them both to Pendragon Castle's throne room. The area was vacant of life, and Mab began to sprint from the middle of the room to the King's throne in triumph. Frik joined her, not for the desire to do so but the necessity. He was distraught, and as their frantic dance began to slow, he took a seat on the edge of the throne platform. Mab stepped on his hand as she passed, but he remained in place, staring straight ahead in thought. Mab, obliviously lost in her joy, brought them back to Arthur's camp. \"Keep guard for tonight. Make certain they're not interrupted. Both of you should wait until just before dawn to leave. I'll be watching.\" Her eyelids fluttered as she turned her head to one side, drawing power from the stones affixed to her gown as she returned to The Land of Magic. In an instant lightning bleached the tent, highlighting the coal dust that fell to the ground with her departure. Frik knew Arthur's seduction had been their mission. It was an objective they couldn't fail. But deep down, in his heart of hearts, he wished he had never had a hand in helping make it happen. Jealously had awoken within him, erupted in the streams of his blood. He hadn't known Morgan for any great length but what time he had known her was so unlike any other he had experienced in his long lifetime. He couldn't name the feeling, but it was not one from which he wished to part. Nor did he want it to mean as little to Morgan as this night, her time with Arthur. Seeing her, he realized that now was a turning point in his life. Jealousy was not the only emotion awoken, though the others stirred he dare not name. ~oOo~ Before dawn the next morning, when Morgan emerged from the tent without Arthur in her company, Frik was quick to come to her side. \"Ah, Lady Marie, good morning. Do you wish to have the horses made ready for our departure?\" \"I believe it would be best to leave eawly. We have anothew long jowney ahead of us,\" Morgan said, keeping up her act for anyone who might be listening. \"I've aweady let the king know my sentiments.\" Frik leaned in and whispered conspiratorially, \"And, you know, I do believe you already have a certain glow about you.\" \"Yes, well,\" Morgan started, her tone cold as she lowered her eyes. She did not look forward to the pregnancy she'd have to endure, no matter how short it's duration. As a child she'd heard her mother's screams as she'd given birth to Arthur. The pain Lady Igraine had been made to suffer was never forgotten. A warning given to her in childhood as she played with dolls. Frik had distracted her then and so did he now. They walked in silence toward the area where their horses were tethered. When they arrived at the shaded enclosure, they found the horses already saddled and ready for their departure. After giving their farewells and excuses to the inquisitive members of the king's army, the pair was within minutes riding at a fair pace away from the encampment. Out in the open, they began to feel more at ease and spoke freely. \"I didn't think it would be so easy. Awthuw suspected nothing because I'm a woman.\" \"Yes, well, he is his father's son.\" Morgan gave a derisive scoff as she looked over the land. \"I'm to go back to Tintagel now, to wait?\" \"I'm afraid that's all we can do. Madame, however, will endeavor to hasten things along.\" That didn't seem to satisfy Morgan. She'd already wasted so much of her life. Now she had to wait several more years before she could rightfully take the throne. Frustrated, she took hold of the reins of her horse and motioned for it to run ahead, over the green fields. It helped her to ride precariously. Being with child, she soon wouldn't be able to live so dangerously. She couldn't let her emotions get the best of her. Morgan would wait; gain the needed patience. Queen Mab would help give her everything she desired. With that thought, she resolved to rise above her former self. When Frik caught up with her she turned to face him. \"Shall we wetuwn then?\" \"Madame will want a full report. I'm afraid I won't be able to stay.\" \"Not even a little while?\" \"Well, perhaps... but only for an hour or two.\" Once Frik determined they were a safe distance from the camp, he snapped his fingers and the pair vanished. ~oOo~ ","Summary":" ~oOo~ After parting from Morgan, the men of the camp and the last offerings of rare spices, silks, "},{"Movie":"Merlin","Title":"History Repeats","Author":"CiderDrinker","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12854383","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So, I initially started writing this as a response to the Fanwork Challenge, and gave up partway through as I came up with an idea that was more Merlin-based, and less MA-related (since, love Merlin though I do, MA is utter garbage). Then I tried to finish it for the next prompt (Women), but since quite a lot of the Lady's thoughts revolve around her son (and, to a lesser extent, Merlin), I started work on another one for that, too. BUT, since that one is now officially late, I'm posting this one anyway - my actual February response should be done soon. This is set between the main events of Merlin (so, after Mab's death but before he grows old and reunites with Nimue) and the start of Merlin's Apprentice. You don't really need to know much about MA for this story - just to give you the background: Merlin leaves Camelot after Arthur's death to rest, he falls asleep in a cave for 50 years. During this time, the Lady of the Lake (who is being driven to evil and to hate Camelot because they are poisoning her waters) conceives a child with him (either through raping him in his sleep, or magically stealing his sperm or some other nefarious means). He doesn't find out about this until years later, and at some point when the baby is young, she abandons him back to the mortal world. In the end, she ends up being killed by her son. There you go, you never need to watch it. You're welcome. He looks surprisingly mortal for a child of an elemental king, particularly since he has the blood of another flowing through his veins on his father's side. That is my first thought when I hold him. I ponder names at first – briefly I even consider naming him \"Merlin\" after his father, but I put that idea aside swiftly. I hold him and I watch him and I see his father in his face. I peer into the pools of water – a thousand mirrors all around me – and I see my sister in mine. A part mortal son, who will live and grow and die. Who will love me, love me as a mother, love me more than Merlin ever loved Mab. Or who will hate me, resent me, because how can I stop him? I used to understand mortal hearts, and now they are closed to me. I helped Merlin, helped him save the land and defeat Mab, and now the land reviles me as a devil and Merlin has left me to be forgotten. I look in another mirror, and for a moment Mab is looking back at me, staring with barely concealed disdain. Perhaps a fitting punishment for what you did to me I turn away. Mab is gone. I helped Merlin defeat her. This is no more than a shade of my own thoughts. I hold my son closer to my chest and walk quickly away from the pools. He starts to cry, and I rock him backwards and forwards, drying the tears on his face with a thought. I will think of a name for him later. – The water has begun to grow darker, murky blacks and greys drifting across the wide expanse of pools in my kingdom. Mab's face seems to flicker through all of them, staring at me, as though in accusation. \"Go away!\" I hiss, not sure anymore whether I am talking to this image of my sister, or the poison that Camelot is pouring into my lake, the dams they use to block my streams. Mab's mouth twitches slightly into a smirk. The mortals are flowing away from you sister. Aren't you going to accept it? My son reaches out, trails his fingers in the water, before pulling his hand back with a wail. The water has left murky marks across his fingers. I try to soothe him, rocking him in my arms. \"It's all right... she's gone now...\" And it is true – every pool around us is blank. Still murky and dark and poisonous, but not a reflection in sight. I hold my son up to see this, but he continues to wail, nothing will soothe him. \"Please... please stop crying little one...\" If anything he only gets louder. Wailing, the noise getting higher until my whole kingdom seems to echo with the sound of screams. \"Be quiet!\" Every pool in the room bursts upwards, as though suddenly turned to geysers, and stays suspended in mid-air, tiny droplets of poison hanging around us. It takes me a moment to recognise that the voice had been my own, so like my sister had it sounded. My son stares up at me, wide eyed, frightened, and I feel something like remorse. \"I am sorry...\" He cannot fear me , \"... I'm sorry...\" He cannot hate me... I hear her chuckle behind me, and I whirl around, horrified, for between the droplets of black and purple and murky green, Mab stands staring out of the darkness at me. The child starts crying again, and Mab's gaze flickers to him, thoughtfully. For a few moments, I am too astonished to do anything but watch her watching him. I blink several times to clear my eyes, expecting to see Mab vanish, but instead she is standing even closer to me. My son stops crying, and when I look down I see his eyes staring at my sister in fascination, and feel a sting of betrayal. Mab's eyes rise to meet mine, and she smirks slightly. My nephew seems to like me. Perhaps one day I will whisper some of his mother's sins in his ear. I turn and stalk away, trying to ignore the images suddenly playing out in the waters around me. Mab fading into nothing. A decades long war between mother and son. And a young man listening to the words of his aunt in a land underground. – The pattern continues for days. My son wails. Nothing I say or do can soothe him, not even the most dazzling enchantments left to me. But Mab is always there, flickering at the edges of my vision like a flame, and as soon as she steps into the child's line of sight, he is silent, watching her with instant fascination and awe. I clench my teeth, and ignore Mab's gaze, certain it will always be triumphant. For a while I console myself that this is the temporary fascination of mortal infancy, nothing that cannot be overcome later, when he is old enough to learn to love the lake and fear his dark, cold aunt. But then I look at his face, at Merlin's face, and I remember that his father never learned to love the Land of Magic, and he never learned to fear me either... Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not any more. The more I wait, the more I fear that I am cradling my own death in my arms. Perhaps this will be Mab's final victory? Perhaps that is why she is here, to see it play out? Am I here to watch you doom yourself, or am I just a fancy born out of your guilt? Do make your mind up, dear sister. – I place him in a basket, woven with fairy arts, and I carry him to the edge of my kingdom. I carry him further than that, my magic carrying him down the river until his journey ends at a small fishing hut. A man reaches down and lifts my son from his basket, staring at him in astonishment as though he is a miracle – and indeed he is, a perfect, beautiful child, born of magic when it shouldn't be possible. I watch, and fancy that if I were mortal there would be tears in my own eyes. When I turn back to my kingdom, Mab is there again, watching my son leave me, and for a moment I feel some kind of triumph, though part of me knows that this is fruitless, I am simply fighting with myself. \"He is out of your reach, Mab. Out of both of our reaches.\" Her eyes flicker back to my face without even moving her head. Standing there like a pillar of obsidian. You have lost him. \"I will watch over him. I will see him happy. One day, when the kingdoms are at peace... when you are gone...\" A throaty laugh. I will never be gone. I am part of you. \"I will protect him,\" I repeat fiercely. You will poison him. \"He is mine.\" He will be his father's son. \"He will never meet Merlin. Merlin will never know of him. He will not know either of us. He will not harm me.\" The look in Mab's eyes is almost pity. You poor fool.

He had to remind himself of this, not let the image leave his thoughts. \"Mordred was not you.\" She laughed, a ring to her voice, she was gaining life from him, even though he did not turn, he gave her something still and this angered him. \"I would not have you young and foolish.

Honoria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12850609","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ~oOo~ Morgan le Fay had for hours been sealed within the cell of her mind and body; a casing that from its core felt mutilated and torn beyond healing. She, a lithe form composed of bones, skin and thick, clotting blood, was extracting from her wounds and womb another living being such as herself. She wept against her wishes, and could feel and see the life-force that had once flowed through her veins now pooled around her lower body, coarsely sticking to her hips and thighs. As vapors of steam the midwife's words penetrated her mind but were ignored for the most part or soon lost. For how much longer, she wondered, would she continue. How much more could her body withstand before it finally succumbed to a death brought on by new life. She'd endured the pain of labor for hours, witnessing through a window the moon in its eclipse make way for a scarlet sun. In her bed of soiled sheets, her confidence was siphoned from her along with her blood, and she began to see a black crape sky of stars awaiting her. A coal map folded many times over, unfolded and pricked with pins. Behind it a lamp held by a figure great and unseen passed as if time, igniting constellations. Frik was beside Morgan, holding her hand, but it hardly seemed to matter. Pain was foremost on her mind. Torment and the desire for its end. The room was suddenly lit as though by a strike of lightning as Queen Mab came into being, materializing at a distance from Morgan's feet. Her majestic figure was hunched to closely view matters of interest; her sapphire cloak grasped tightly by glinting hands crossed at her waist. Her eyes narrowed as she looked to the distance, unseeingly. \"It's time,\" she uttered. In a matter of seconds the midwife, who was unaware of any supernatural attendance, announced that she had seen the child; that it was coming. Persevering, Morgan gathered her strength and will, fighting until she could hear the baby's cries as it left her body. With the child finally free, she collapsed back into the bed, breathing heavily. Her eyes closed, and she saw trails of blue and gold dusts amid the black expanse. She laughed breathlessly. \"It's a boy,\" the midwife announced, her tone betraying her preference for the sex to which the infant belonged. Morgan was acutely aware of the child's gender. She'd known it since he had initially been conceived in thought. A maple key cast into the soil of her mind when the visiting gnome had been a stranger to her. Yet, something in her rejoiced upon hearing the reality of the situation. Her child now lived outside of dreams. Sweeping downwards, his hair adhering to the perspiration on her face, Frik bent to kiss Morgan's forehead and cheek. As she raised out from under the cold, ice-like surface of her weakened self, she realized with a sudden wave of shock that she could no longer hear her son. She discovered as she moved why he had grown silent; Queen Mab had collected him into her arms and was cradling him so closely, and with such relevance, it was as though she herself had just given birth to him. From her eyes there radiated a warmth, and admiration Morgan was unused to seeing associated with the goddess, and she was for a moment stunned into silence. \"He's beautiful,\" Morgan heard Mab say in awe, her voice barely above a whisper. With one hand supporting the baby's head and another at his back, Queen Mab raised the boy to the air. \"This child's name is to be Mordred. He will reign as king and restore the Old Ways.\" The words were the same as an oath to the earth; the elements, the future. As though in their being said aloud the predictions would with certainty come to fruition. Mab's coal shadowed eyes were heavily lidded as she regarded the child, revealing that the mistress of magic had herself become enchanted. \"May I have him?\" Morgan asked, after some length. She extended her hands, reaching out for the swaddled, silent infant. \" My son.\" Mab inhaled sharply, the spell of suspension broken. With features returned to their normal cast, Mab slowly moved to Morgan's side. Her skirt and cloak rustled with her steps. Her heels clicked against the stone floor. Queen Mab reluctantly placed the newborn in his mother's arms, caressing his temple as she eased away. Morgan noticed Mab's gaze lower as she observed the child; a faint smile spread across her lips. \"Raise him well, Morgan le Fay. Do as you have sworn: Instill in him the wisdom of the Old Ways.\" She stepped back, folding her arms. \"I will be back soon, to visit Mordred.\" With another flash of light, the Queen was gone. In her wake, Morgan brought the baby close, embracing him. She looked to his sweet, tired face and found the beauty that had the same as possessed Mab. O The floorboards protested beneath Nimue's bare feet as she came nearer the exit of her room. Through the door, she could hear the merged voices of the brothers in prayer. Her open window allowed inside the sounds of newly woken birds, waves lapping against the shore of the island, insects and the autumn wind. Avalon Abbey filled Nimue with serenity and peace. A drowsy sense of being and fulfillment. In it she felt closer to God. In the absence of comfort provided by the man she loved, she was granted the love of another. A love that never faded. One that was giving and beautiful. Her love for God surpassed that of mortal endearment, that of the flesh and heart. Even while bearing such love, she at times felt wanting for what most took for granted. A face free of scars; a life lived with a husband. Nimue knew Merlin would marry her as she was, her face and body covered with cloth and ruin, and he would move her to the cabin in the forest where he'd been raised. Free from the eyes of strangers, he promised, free from their whispers, but she knew it was all a dream. He was always being taken from her. They would never be alone, not while Merlin had his protege to raise and an enemy in Queen Mab. For now, Nimue was content to dwell in the abbey, drifting through life. Each day spent in patterns of prayers, the tending of the garden and its herbs; speaking with the sisters and brothers she knew as family. She usually spent evenings alone, eating by herself; reading or viewing the world outside her window. The land in the distance of Avalon held little promise. News of the outside world was met with apprehension. Nimue longed to hear word regarding King Arthur and Camelot, as they were tied to Merlin. But at the same time, she feared the possible discovery of another obstruction set in their path. Sometimes a new soul in need of healing would arrive at the abbey, and she would watch the sisters as they mended the ill. She offered aid when it was needed, and often sat by the person's side in prayer. They could not ask her name, much less comprehend a story were she to tell one, but she brought wet rags to their temples. She held their hands and whispered to them hymns and prayers that God would hear if they did not. When they came to wake, Nimue would ask the sisters of their progress but not linger as before. She couldn't bear the judgement of those who did not know her. Unlike Nimue, the patients would leave the abbey after they were healed, and she would never see them again through any means other than memory. She found that her memory was now forced to serve her in conjuring the images of all of her loved ones. The war between Vortigern and Uther had taken her father's life, and in a sense it had taken Merlin's as well. They had all, in their way, taken with their descent ties to her being. But the person she held most responsible was another woman. The same woman who created the source of much of her happiness. O Queen Mab passed through the halls of Pendragon Castle. She was to the King's eyes a procession of shadows, though her presence was unmistakable. She crept through the darkness to him, a hand ghosting over his back, and he discovered that the air near him was frigid. A man of strength and determination, Vortigern could not help but feel his resolve weaken, his knees give with the thought of his surrender. As he turned to face Mab she faded, leaving him to question if he'd been dreaming. o Vortigern began to await Mab's return as evening descended, having imagined her slow progression of the moonlit hall throughout the day. He would move from one candlelit room to another, choosing to walk in darkness when it came time to enter his room. Weeks passed before she reappeared. O Mab would send herself to her palace in the Land of Magic after leaving Vortigern. The King's blue eyes were last to disappear from her vision as she faded from his home and into her own. The faerie queen in a warrior's armor displayed to the king a strength she did not feel the need to show others, just as she gave him the gift of her weakness shelled in metal cuirass. The armor she wore always beneath the skin was now a visible exoskeleton. Mab saw in Vortigern shards of the same broken mirror that made up a part of herself. Placed in his eye would she not appear? She did not believe she could say the same for herself, for out of her no speck of discarded glass would reveal to the world his face. She came to him to invite the thoughts that as drops of rain beaded the web connecting them. To perceive them culminating in him, and to take into her palm the solution of that anticipation; making it solid as a shard of quartz. She would then scryer the images that were performed in the theater of his mind and her own. The follies of mortals and elements. The commingling of flesh and dreams. O O Guinevere knew early on that her fate would be decided for her by others. As a young girl she, like all of her sex and nobility, could the same as foresee her future but not silence the wish for more than it held. Her father would arrange her marriage, and she would be made to comply with his wishes. Marry for advancement, for power. For the betterment of one's family. Be content with the life you are blessed with and the union you make as many have in their hearts a great desire for that which you dismiss. o When it came time to marry, Guinevere did not find herself in as desolate a situation as she had imagined. For Arthur was a kind and handsome man. His company and conversation enjoyable. Their life together was chiefly without worry; an amiable friendship that could at times feel as though it had blossomed into something more. She was content, for the most part, aside from an awareness of another side present within the King. Another door made open, through which Arthur was weighted with sadness and regret. In this room of shadow and torment Arthur existed as a shrouded being, begging God and his son for mercy. When he emerged, it was as his former self, though he remained fixated on redemption. From what heinous sin need he repent, she wondered. She would with subtlety ask him as such, though he never shared with Guinevere the travesties of his past. She wished that he would feel as though he could trust his wife as no other, save God. But she was, as in other matters, cast aside in favor of a man. Arthur's confidant and closest friend was his former tutor, the wizard Merlin. All matters of importance were discussed with him and the circle of Arthur's closest and most trusted friends; the Knights of the Round Table. As time progressed, she learned to live within herself; she could escape through such means. O The King knew her standing; that she would rather he stay in Camelot and abandon the seemingly impossible quest for the Holy Grail. As king, his land and people required his leadership: his authority and wisdom. She needed him. To proceed on his quest was in her eyes, not only a fool's errand, but rather arrogant of Arthur, despite his good intentions. But he would not listen to reason. When Merlin brought to Camelot the King's champion, Guinevere experienced a rush of exhilaration in seeing him, as if the dreams of her maidenhood hadn't been lost to her; in Lancelot they could reawaken. And they did. Everything in her awoke from the harsh and heavy stagnation through which she'd aimlessly been wading, and she was set on dry land. She recognized passion where before it had only been gestures, movements; all was fire to her now. Fire and whispers in the night. Meetings behind secret doors. They called to one another wordlessly, as if linked by unknown means. Guinevere never knew such unrestrained happiness. The days were balmy, and she was almost perpetually at peace. A shadow pursued her, though, casting all around him a cloud of darkness. As wind across a field, as ripples in water so did he move. The shadow attempted to spread his oblivion to the heights of which she'd risen, but he couldn't touch her. She wouldn't let him. As the sweep of his dark fingers reached for her, she swatted at their claws or disregarded them. What she had committed was a sin. She knew it. He needn't inform her. She'd committed it over and over again. But she had finally attained her happiness, after so many years of waiting. No one would take it from her.

I was only ever half human and when in the Land of Magick I needed the human world, yet I never really spoke of how much I needed the other world, her world. Staying a length of time in either place suffocated me not that I'd ever have let her know just how much I felt her within me. For a slip in time it was Mordred who made me feel remorse, made me feel envy. Perhaps I could have been closer to Queen Mab, perhaps our story could have had a very different ending. In my opinion words like perhaps and regret are of no use so it is best not to dwell upon them for they can not be changed that is known.

Would you like some more cereal sweetheart? Here you go\" An old woman said to her young son. She walked by his side and put some more cereal in his bowl. Suddenly her husband got in the kitchen with their other son who was screaming and kicking uncontrollably. \"He's really being a monster again today. Trudy goddamn it help me\" The man said furious. \"Oh, can't you be more careful?\" The woman said to her husband who had just brought her mould down. \"I'm doing the best I can. He's out of control\" \"Sit still. Stop it!\" She started to get really angry. \"Oh, why can't you be more like your brother?\" She told and that made the boy crazier. \"Be quiet. Shut up!\" She finally said. The boy scratched her hand causing it to bleed. Without second thought she slapped him in the face. PRESENT DAY \" There's a place in Tribeca for three thousand\" Paige pointed at a newspaper eating a French fry. Carly looked at her with a depressed expression. \"That's too expensive. The money I saved up won't cover two months rent . I'm gonna have to work every second I'm not in class until graduation. \"Carly, don't even think about not going\" \"I'm not\" Carly said determined . \"Good. Because you know how proud I am of you\" I said getting into their conversation and smiling at Carly. My name is Sabina. I'm Carly's best friend and I have known her since junior high. She knows me better than anyone else and I love her as a sister. We decided to follow Blake to that game because he begged us. It was also a good chance to have fun and relax a bit. That was going to be a very long weekend. And of course not in a good way. Our group kept secrets and disruptions and it was difficult for all of us to communicate. We were all so same but also so different. We had different lives and personalities and sometimes very intense reactions. Paige was probably pregnant from Blake and she didn't know how to tell him. Carly was going to move to New York and she expected from Wade to follow her. Nick was supposed to be the badass but he wasn't. I knew he only wanted to play it cool but in reality he had a great soul that he hide very well. Dalton was the sweet \"clown\" of the group who took our problems away with his jokes but he was not a moron. He was trying to hide his huge love for Carly who was tugged with Wade. Wade was confused and not ready to move. And I, myself, I was the only one who was single. No boyfriend, no love, no butterflies in my stomach. I was enjoying being a college girl and having fun with my crazy friends. \"Aha, it's only an internship\" Carly answered. \"At Instyle magazine\" Paige added. \"Or would you rather stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" I teased her. \"No Sabina, thanks\" \"Yeah, of course\" I said looking away. \"She is kind of weird\" Paige whispered to Carly, but I could hear what she was saying. \"No, not at all. She is fine\" I heard Carly saying but I didn't talk. \"How are you so sure?\" Paige insisted but I kept ignoring her. \"She has no boyfriend, no pregnancy and no moving\" Carly said and I noiselessly laughed at her smart comment. \"Whatever you say\" Paige finally answered with a small grin. I turned and I saw Wade coming. That man was so tall that I had to lift my head quit high to face his pretty eyes. \"Hey babe\" Wade said and kissed her cheek. \"Hi\" Carly simply said. \"Sorry, there were two rednecks in the bathroom. \"Really?\" Carly said surprised. \"There's no rednecks in New York\" Paige said teasing them. \"No. There's not. Wade answered a little annoyed . \"There are rednecks everywhere. Don't listen to her\" I smiled at him and he did the same. \"I'm gonna go see what Blake's doing. He seems to like that car more than me nowadays\" She said and left us behind. Now that we have a second… And I'm not trying to make this a big deal. You know I want to have a good time on our trip this weekend. But why on earth did your brother have to come with us?\" You said your parents weren't gonna post his bail anymore\" Wade started and I felt sorry that he thought like that about Nick. Nick was a great guy but he was misunderstood. \"They didn't. Blake did. He invited him\" Carly apologized.\"I guess he makes him feel more badass, I don't know\" \"Good. Blake invited your brother . Sabina came with us, Nick carried his little girlfriend, Stacy, with him and even Dalton brought Maribel with him\" Wade complained as he always did. \"Wade you become worse than Nick. We know them, we are in the same college. They seem very cool. Dalton happens to have a girlfriend and Stacy is able to control Nick. \"Yeah, maybe\" Wade finally said. \"I'm sorry Wade I thought you enjoyed our company\" I said to him a little pissed. \"No it's not like that, I'm sorry Sabina, I smiled at him and I left the table. \"Blake?\" Paige asked her boyfriend who was having little fun by listening to music and playing with his GPS. \"Blake\" She tried again but she received no answer. \"Fine\" She turned to leave. \"Baby come back here. You know it ain't like that. I was messing with the GPS and I saw a shortcut. I think it'll save us an hour. So we can spend more time\" Those two were extremely mushy sometimes. \"Oh my god Dalton why the hell did you have to bring that camera with you?\" I asked him boringly. \"Come on, relax, we'll have many great moments. I have to film them all. \"I want them all!\" I teased him and he punched my arm a bit. \"I'm serious!\" He said with a stubborn look on his cute face. \"Yeah sure\" \"Sabina don't be like that\" He begged me and I could not resist him. \"Alright\" I finally answer and I felt his hand on my arm. \"Come on, let's go have some fun\" He said and dragged me where Paige and Blake were. He turned his camera on and he approached them. \"How are you doing? Hello!\" He said laughing at them. \"Dalton put that camera down\" Blake ordered him. \"God\" Paige added. \"You guys are lame. I'm out of here. Come on Sabina. See you squabs\" He told me and I followed him. We sat up with Carly and Wade when we saw Nick coming out, Stacy following him. \"What's up crow man?\" He said to a beggar holding his beer in his hand. Stacy looked at him with a sad expression. He took a large gulp and he said to the miserable man to get a job. He finally sat with us and Wade tried tried to break the ice. \"So, what do you think, guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?\" I looked at Dalton and he did the same. Carly lowered her head and Nick answered him as if he was drunk. \"Yeah\" Dalton turned his camera on again. \"Dalton, please don't film me\" Carly said. \"What? I'm not filming now\" He lied. \"But the red light is on\" She said. \"Put the camera down. She doesn't like having people up in her face. She falls under pressure\" Nick said looking at her insistently. \"You got something to say to me, Nick?\" Carly asked angrily. \"No, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?\" \"Guys please\" I finally said and Nicked stopped it and kissed Stacy tenderly on her forehead then he took her in his arms still staring at Carly. \"You guys are… oh let's get out of here\" Dalton said nodding at me and he went to stand up. \"Where the hell is Maribel, Dalton? Shouldn't you have known?\" I asked grinning at him cutely. \"You are right. She should have already been there\" \"My god is she still in the bathroom or…\" I sighed worriedly. \"Don't worry I'll go check it\" Dalton said and he went to find her. After a while he and Maribel came out. I noticed that Maribel was quite pale. \"Maribel, are you okay?\" I asked her and nodded smiling at me. \"Ok let's go then\" Dalton said and we headed to our cars. Reviews are welcome[Chapter 2] It's been a long time since my last update. Anyway I finally decided to write…hope you like it =) =-) Chapter 2 \"Baby you a little pale, do you know?\" Dalton said to his short and runty girlfriend. \"Dalt, that's ok. I'm fine\" She said and she gave him a kiss to his cheek. \"So, how are we gonna do this?\" Wade asked noticing that we were too many to fit in only two cars. \"That's right but don't worry, as you can see I brought my car so we are going to be fine\" I answered. \"Ok. So let's see…Dalton, Maribel, Nick, Stacy you come with me\" I said but I was interrupted by Wade. \"That's not necessary…some of them can come with us\" Wade tried to be generous. \"No way dude, I will enter your car as an \"I\" and I will get out as an \"S\" \" Dalton laughed and I looked at him laughing, too. \"Sorry Wade but he is right! \" I laughed louder and it did the others to laugh too, except Wade who had a look like \"I feel like an asshole now\". After that we got in our cars and started our route. Blake was in front of Wade and me was the last one. I didn't even know where we were going, so that was the more appropriate to do. I saw from the mirror the two couples kissing and after an hour of driving and silence I sighed. \"Sabi, don't you feel alone right now? Want me to find you a boyfr…\" Dalton teased me. \"Shut up Dalton\" I said not letting him to finish his sentence. \"Don't be like that, Sabi I love you\" He tried again with a goofy and at the same time sad expression. \"I love you too boy, but if you keep talking me like that Mary will be mad\" \"He doesn't change\" I heard her saying a little bit annoyed. Maribel has been dating Dalton for about three months but, to be honest I don't get on well with her. It's not that she showed me anything but she was jealous of him sometimes while she didn't seem to like him a lot. \"Maribel gimme a kiss\" Dalton said but suddenly his girlfriend pushed him away and asked me to stop the car. \"Pull over. Please pull over, I need to get out!\" I goggled my eyes and stopped my vehicle. \"What the hell happened? Come on I was just kidding…\" Dalton cried and she burst out of the car and threw up. \"Oh god…\" I heard Nick burble. \"Dalt…Oh my…\" I thought for a moment. \"Is she pregnant?\" Stacy asked. \"No, no please do not say this, how could she?\" Dalton said and hurried to get out of the car. His stupid question made me burst. \"I have an idea asshole\" I said looking at him. \"Maribel please, are you okay? It' s not what I'm thinking, huh? I mean we are not dating for a long time…\" \"Dalton please, I'm not sure ok?\" She said a little pissed. I sighed loudly when I noticed that I had lost the others. \"Oh shit!\" I said desperately. \"We've lost them?\" Nick said lying his head on the back seat. \"I think we have\" \"We will find them. Just go on\" Dalton went to enter the car. \"No, she is not well. We have to go back!\" I shouted a bit. \"But Sabina they will be looking for us\" he retorted. \"Just shut up!\" Nick shouted. \"Nick! We have not time for this! Please!\" I retorted. \"Look. We are following them. If she keeps feeling sick we are going back ok?\" \"Alright but…\" Dalton started with a confused expression. \"Buy what? We have to go now otherwise we will lose the others\" I said and I started the engine not waiting for an answer. Dalton and his obviously pregnant girlfriend got in the car as I tried adjust my eyes in the dark to see where the others were. \"Ok we are fucked up now!\" I almost shouted when I realized I couldn't see the cars. \"Go on. Don't worry we will find them\" Nick whispered and I barely understood what he had said. \"Whatever you say\" I answered not really wanting to talk anymore. I was driving in silence for a few minutes when I suddenly crashed into a corpse of a deer that was lying in the middle of the road. \"Shit!\" I shouted with my eyes wide open. I could hear the girls' loud screams as the boys tried to see what had happened. \"Women and driving\" Nick cursed under his breath. \"Shut up asshole, don't you see what's in front of me!\" I said while I was trying to catch my breath. The boys took out of got out of the car and so did I. \"What the hell is this?\" Dalton asked not believing what he was seeing. Nick folded his arms an then scratched his head. \"Well, I guess it's a piece of shit. What I don't understand is why the others didn't fell on this\" \"You are damn right Nick\" I said thinking that it couldn't be in the middle of the road before and Blake hadn't collided with it first. \"Something is going on\" Dalton murmured. \"This is starting to freak me out\" Stacy said as she walked out of the car heading towards Nick and hugging him tightly. He happily approved her hug and touched her hair to ensure her that we would be fine. \"You know what , I think we should go back. I told you from the beginning that we have to go back. Maybe this is a sigh. \"Don't be silly babe, I'll drive for you \"Nick told me. \"No, no…\" I started but he had already tried the car. \"You've got to be fucking kidding me!\" He yelled as I approached my car to see what happened. \"What is it now?\" \"It's not starting\" \"Of course, maybe it stuck, try again\" \"Look there must be a problem\" \"How could be I didn't crashed it that hard\" \"You know it's not the newest car in the world\" Dalton laughed at Nick's comment as I looked at my dad's old-fashioned and overused car \"Don't laugh…what…what are you laughing at Mr. septic-Tank-Man!\" I said angrily. \"That was not kind\" He said with a fake angry expression on his pretty face but I could say that he did his best to keep himself of laughing harder. \"So, what are we gonna do?\" Maribel asked sitting at the back seat of my \"not so modern car\" as the others used to call it, and looking at the almost deserted area around her. \"I really don't know guys. I don't know where the fuck we are going so I cannot take that risk. I was following the others and now I've lost them. And last but not least, my car broke down\". \"Is there a gas station around this place? We should look around here a bit and maybe we will find a mechanic\" Nick suggested. \"Sorry guys I should have just let you go with Wade's car. His car is a mess but surely better than mine\" \"Don't be silly, there was no way to go with them\" Dalton said and approached me. He took my hand to encourage me. \"You were just generous\" \"I took you with me and now look what happened\". \"Sabina that's not your fault, but we have to find something to do\" Nick said and he was right. \"Yeah, Blake and the others must be looking for us\" Dalton added. \"What about walking?\" \"Dalt are you crazy? It's freezing and we don't even know where we are going\" I told him. \"Do you have a better idea?\" \"I…\" I started, when I heard my phone ringing. \"I have\" I showed them my cell phone. We were all so damn stupid that we didn't think to call them to come and get us. \" Hey, what's up? Where are you?\" I heard Carly's voice. She was slightly worried. \"Hey, honey, you are not going to believe what happened. I crashed with a dead deer and we are in the middle of the road waiting like idiots. I didn't even think to call ya\" I explained. \" Don't worry, we are coming to get you stay right there… oh, and we are going to camp out for tonight. It's getting late. We wake up early tomorrow. That's what Blake told us\" \"Alright… and Carly…sorry and thanks\" \" Ha-ha, no problem sweetie, bye\" She hung up and I was really relieved. \"Carly and Wade are coming to pick us up\" Nick sighed and Dalton did the same. Their faces were priceless. \"Guys, don't be like that, you see Wade is not so bad\" I said thinking that was very kind of Wade to return for us. \"What about your car sweetie?\" Dalton asked. \"Ah, you are damn right Dalt, my dad is going to kill me\" \"Look, what about going with them and then looking for someone to fix it?\" Dalton suggested. I could say he really cared about me. \"We are camping out tonight. Carly told me that we are leaving tomorrow for the game and there is no way I'm leaving my car for that long\" I protested. \"There must be a town near the campsite\" Nick added. \"We passed a sign with that wax museum, remember?\" \"Nick you are a genius!\" I said and I run to him giving him a kiss to his cheek. \"That was great dude!\" Dalton said and we waited impatiently for Carly and Wade to come. Everything was going to be fine…or was it? Review please :) :)[Chapter 3] I do not own anything except my own characters :) Chapter 3 We were waiting impatiently for about 30 minutes when we heard Wade's car approaching. I mouthed him a \"thank you\" and we got into his car. It was quite difficult to fit in it but there wasn't other way. \"Wade, thanks again\" I repeated. \"No problem\" he said and started the car, I was in the middle, Nick was on my left and Dalton was on my right, each of them holding their girlfriends. \"So, what actually happened?\" Carly asked. \"I had car trouble. I firstly hit a deer and then my car wasn't starting\" \"A deer you said?\" Wade asked surprised. \"Yeah, otherwise there was no way to crowd in that hole\" Nick taunted looking outside the window. \"Nick, please\" I said strictly. \"So…\" Carly pretended to ignore his comment \"your car broke down?\" What are you going to do now?\" \"I don't know. I might go to that town near the camp site to find someone to fix it\" \"But how do you know that there is a town near the camp site?\" \"Once again I don't know, we'll see, but there is no way I am leaving my car. Maybe someone has already stolen it\" \"Don't be silly. It doesn't start and you don't have any important things in it, do you?\" Nick asked me and I looked at him like I had seen a ghost when I realized I had forgotten my wallet. \"Oh god, that's not my day, I forgot my wallet. That was the only really important thing I had in it\" \"Don't worry maybe we could find someone immediately\" Dalton told me and I had nothing to do but wait. When we finally arrived at a quiet place to camp out we got out of the car and we saw Paige and Blake sitting on a chair kissing. Me, Dalton and Nick made a face and we helped Wade with his stuff. Actually me and Dalton went to help while Nick was lighting up a cigarette and opened a beer that Blake had just passed him. \"Yeah don't help us or nothing!\" Dalton yelled and I laughed. \"Come on let's help Wade\" I said sweetly and he obeyed smiling at me. \"Do you want to go into town tonight?\" he asked me. \"When?\" I asked. \"Now\" He simply answered \" I don't know, isn't it late?\" \"Well, maybe, but we have to hurry otherwise someone could strip your car tonight\" \"You are right\" I said and I went to leave but suddenly stopped and looked at him again realizing his offer. \"Dalton, are we going together?\" \"Of course, what do you want to leave you go alone to that place in the dark?\" \"Very nice of you but… you should stay here with Maribel, she is not well\" \"I'm going with you and that's final\" he said and left me before I could say no. I went after him and I sat with the girls. After a while I saw Dalton and Maribel talking and from the look on their faces I could say they were arguing. I somehow felt guilty for their fight. I returned to Carly and I pretended to join their conversation. After a while I saw Dalton coming to me \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes, I have nothing to take with me except my car keys anyway\" I said and I stood up. \"Guys where are you going you don't even know where this place is\" \"Carly, I have to go\" \"But it seems dangerous\" \"I know but just let me try it. If we won't find it we are coming back, ok?\" \"Fine, take this\" She handed me a flashlight and hugged me. \"Be careful\" Paige said. \"Are you sure you wanna go with septic man?\" Nick joked. \"Shut up dude!\" Dalton shouted and made Nick laugh. \"Dalt, come on it's getting late\" I said and we started walking into the woods. After a few minutes of silence I broke the ice. \"I saw you and Maribel arguing\" I told him coldly. \"We didn't arguing\" he lied. \"What else do you call it?\" \"I just told her I was going with you and she didn't have a problem…\" \"She did\" I interrupted him. He didn't talk for a moment when he opened his mouth again. \"Do you want my jacket? It's freezing and…\" \"Look, I don't know what you want but I know what I want and I don't want to be the third person\" I said nervously and I handed him the flashlight, walking faster and leaving him behind. I walked rapidly and I suddenly slipped into a pile of carcasses. I screamed and Dalton run after me. \"Sabina!\" he said shouted and he hurried to find me. \"Look out! There are dead animals out here. I'm stuck!\" I yelled frightened. \"Hold on I'm coming, I'm coming\" he said and he turned the light to where I was. He quickly climbed down the bloody mess and took me in his arms. \"Are you okay?\" He asked me looking me straight in the eyes \"Why do you have to be so damn stubborn?\" He quietly asked and I buried my head into his chest. I closed my eyes for a moment and after that I felt car lights blinding me. Dalton released me and I saw a man walking out of his car and throw a dead deer, adding a new member to the bloody mess. \"Hey! What is that?\" I asked and he looked at me with a strange look. He was not very tall, with blond dirty hair and yellow teeth. His clothing was dirty as hell and the sultry smell invaded our nostrils making us want to throw up. \"What are you two doing in here in the middle of the night?\" he asked and I looked at Dalton not knowing what to say. \"We, ah, we had car trouble and…\" I heard Dalton saying and I thought that the car was mine and I had put him in so much trouble. \"Well, I got some gas in the truck if…\" the man started. \"No. We need someone to fix it. We hit a deer like this\" \"Do you throw them everywhere?\" I asked him a little pissed, still holding Dalton's jacket. \"No miss, I don't know what you are talking about\" \"A deer in the middle of the road, I don't know, it's a bit strange isn't it?\" Dalton asked. \"Not in here. Many of us are hunters so it is usual. It's easier when you get used to it. \"I don't think I could ever get used to it\" I said. \"You can get used to anything if you are around it long enough. If they are fresh I just take them home. Why waste the meat? Others pay to eat it, right?\" \"Anyway, we need someone to fix our car\" Dalton repeated. Our car? What was he saying? If it wasn't for that creepy man I would really scold him badly. \"Well, where is your car?\" The man asked. \"A few miles away from the camp site, outside the forests\" I answered. \"Camp site?\" \"Yes, our friends are waiting for us\" \"Look, you have to arrange that with Bo, he owns the gas station. I don't know if he is still awake, though\" \"Is the town near?\" Dalton asked and eyed the man suspiciously. \"Yeah I could give you a ride\" \"Are you serious?\" I asked surprised but at the same time relieved that we had found someone to take us there. \"If you like\" He said and smiled to me. Dalton noticed that and he took of his jacket. He gave it to me and he covered me asking me to change my dirty blouse.\" Are you kidding me? You only wear a flannel, you will die from the cold\" \"Just wear it\" he insisted. When I was done I mouthed him an \"Ok\" and I followed him to the creepy man's truck. I sat in the middle and Dalton sat next to me holding my hand. I eyed him but I didn't talk. The man got into the driver seat and started the truck. \"Could you open the window please?\" I asked Dalton. \"Yeah\" he tried to open it but the handle was broken. \"Sorry about that. Truck's seen better days\" the man apologized. \"Do you mind rolling down your window, then?\" I said feeling dizzy from the smell. \"Not at all. How is it now?\" he asked kindly. \"It's not that bad\" I said slightly smiling. \"Well, do you usually go hunting at night?\" Dalton asked. \"No, I just had them on the back from my morning hunting and I decided to throw them at night\" \"Oh…\" it was all I said and I looked at my watch. It read 10:30. \"I know it's a bit late but I have to get my car done. I forgot my wallet in it and I don't want anyone to strip it. \"It's okay. You just have to find Bo\" \"You think he would follow us to her tonight?\" Dalton asked not believing that the man called Bo would follow us that late to repair my car. \"Look, it is his job. I don't think he will have any problem\" I nodded and I looked at the knife at his belt. \"Do you like knives?\" He asked me excited. \"No… not really\" I said and I leaned a little bit more on Dalton. \"Tools of the trade. You wanna see it?\" \"That's okay\" \"It's a bowie. It's a good knife. That'll cut through anything\" He said and he abruptly pinned it on the side of the truck which was in front of me. I jumped and Dalton did the same when he jerkily stopped the car at the same time. \"What's going on? You said the town was up here\" Dalton asked confused. \"Well, yeah, there is. It's just around that bend. I gotta flip my hubs into four-wheel. You mind giving me a hand?\" \"Are you sure about that? Where was the last time you were in here?\" I asked him and the look on his face changed. \"You don't believe me? I forgot this way in's washed out, that's all\" \"Alright, thanks but we'll walk the rest of the way. You've done enough\" Dalton tried to be kind. \"Now, why would you want to do that? The man insisted. \"Look, we wanna walk, okay? Just let us out now\" I slightly yelled and he finally gave in. \"Sure\" he said and he headed to Dalton's side taking his knife with him. That made me afraid and I pulled Dalton to my side. \"Well, get out, then\" he told us angrily \"Try and do something nice for someone…\" \"Look, it's not like that we appreciate it\" Dalton tried to seem grateful but the man seemed stricken. \"Yeah, I can tell\" \"Sorry\" I simply said to him and I looked at Dalton. \"Let's go\" He obeyed and we started walking. We had to pass a small river by stepping on some big rocks that were in it. We were a bit shaken from our previous experience but we didn't know what awaited us once we arrived. REVIEW PLEASE. REVIEWS ARE KEEPING ME WRITING :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 I don't own house of wax. I just love it. Your reviews are what I excpect. We kept walking but I was still feeling those man's eyes making a hole on my back. I looked at Dalton and he did the same. \"Is he still staring?\" I asked him and he looked concerned. \"Yeah. Just keep walking\" He whispered and he came closer to me. \"Are you kidding me, like I'm gonna stop\" I mumbled. \"Damn it, he made me feel like an asshole\" he complained and I slightly patted his back. \"Don't think about it anymore, he was kinda freak. Thank god he brought us up to the town. I thought he was going to kill us\" I told him and he turned to look at me. He took my hand and gave me aprotective look. \"I was not gonna let him hurt you my dear\" He said and I suddenly started to giggle. \"Oh really?\" I said in a low sing-song voice \"You can't even protect yourself Mr perfect. Oh…look how good you look in only those clothes…but your cheeks are red, you 're dying from the cold\" I taunted. \"You are hell sure I don't get cold when I'm next to you\" he said to me with a flirty look and that made me feel akward. I had to admit that I had lost that battle. \"You have something to tell me Dalton?\" I gave him a serious look and I excpected from him to grab this opportunity. But to my surprise he didn't seem willing to tell anything. \"No, I don't have something to tell you…\" he paused for a moment \" but I could still protect you babe, I'm serious\" The word babe made me shiver but I decided not to continue this conversation. \"What do we do now sweetcheeks?\" he finally asked me not wanting to continue this, too. \"I don't know, this place is freaking me out\" I said looking a bit around me \"Everybody is probably sleeping\" \"Well, I don't know. What about asking someone in the church?\" He suggested but I found it impossible that the church was open late at night. \"I don't think there is anyone there, Dalton. We have to find Bo\" I said as I examined the area. \"I agree but where does he live?\" he inquired. \"Look, why don't we go to that gas station?\" I told and thinking that the guy named Bo may be there. \"No, I think we will need that freakshow again to tell us where his house is\" He said scratching his head. \"But why don't we go to the shop instead\" I insisted. \"Sabi there's no way he is in there that late. Besides it's a small town. Probably old people leave here and I guess they don't need extra gas especially at night\" \"I think you are right. Let's go then\" I told him but when I turned my face I saw the creepy man standing behind me. \"You?\" I asked him being a little bit vulnerable around him. He fixed his shirt and smiled at me. \"You finally seem to need my help, don't you?\" He said and Dalton didn't seem to like his presence. I could tell from his eyes. He looked at me and then I looked at the filty man again \"Yeah, I quess\" I gave him a fake smile. \"Well Bo's house is the biggest in town. That near the wax museum\" He kindly said. He maybe really wanted to help us but his appearance did't let anyone to see his true intentions. \"Oh, thank you\" I said and headed to the house. Dalton gave him a hostile glance and he followed me. \"I don't trust this guy\" he said and I looked at him surprised. \"Why, he helped us without even knowing us. Don't be ungrateful\" \"Still, I don't trust him\" he insisted and his behavior made me mad. He was so stubborn sometimes. \"I wanna slap your face right now you know that?\" I said agrily and I slightly pushed him away from me. \"Wait\" He simply said and he tried to catch up with me \"Calm down. We don't have to fight for that idiot. Please\" We walked up the hill with a cold silence surrounding us. I didn't want to talk to him like that but I didn't know what drove me tell all those words to him. When we reached the house Dalton knocked the door. We waited for a few minutes but no one seemed to respond. \"Come on let's give up on this \" I muttered disappointed. Dalton started to walk with me when suddenly a man open the door. \"Hey\" He gently said and I turned to face a tall man standing at the door frame. His dark brown hair was slightly long and his blue eyes looked at us with curiosity. He wore no shirt and I felt like a pervert staring at him without knowing him. \"Hey man are you Bo the mechanic of this town?\" Dalton kindly asked him and he took me with him as he approached the door again. \"The only one. Why do you guys want to know?\" He asked and he folded his arms. \"I'm Dalton and this is my friend Sabina.I know it's not the appropriate time for this but her car broke down and it need to be done soon\" He explained. I let him tell Bo all the details because he knew more about cars and stuff like that. I decided not to talk this time. \"Soon, ha? What exactly is the problem?\" \"Look we don't know for sure but it needs fixing. It's in the middle of the road a few miles away from the campsite and it's not that knew if you know what I mean. And she has personal stuff left in there. You know her pa is going to kill her\" he joked and he looked at me. I bended my head a little bit and I shortly laughed. Then I looked at him still smiling and then I turned to Bo. \"Well, he is right so is there something you can do? I said giving him a small smile too. He did the same and I could say he was quite charming whe he was smiling. \"Something wil be done. Campsite youm said?\" \"Yes. We are not alone we have some friends waiting for us\" I responded. \"Ok I see. That's what we're going to do. Let me change my clothing and I reckon we will meet in about fifteen minutes. Do you agree?\" He was so nice to us despite of our suddent visit. \"Of course we will wait at the gas station. Thanks\" I gave him a last smile and I took Dalton hands leading him to where Bo's shop was. When we were there we decided to wait patiently for another fifteen minutes. \"Don't you have someone in your mind?\" I headr Dalton's voice after a fea minutes of silence. \"What? What are you talking about?\" I asked him calmly. That was preety strange for me actually. \"I mean we see you being all alone when we all of us are in a relationship and…\" \"Do you accusing me of not having a boyfriend?\" I interrupted his words. I felt pretty annoyed of his innuedos because I didn't really want to talk about stuff like that. \"I'm not accusing you for anything I'm just curious\" He looked at me in the eyes and for some reason I felt embarrased. \"Don't look at me like this. I don't want to talk about this subject and I surely don't want to discuss it with you\" I told him and he slowly came closer to me. I felt his hand touching my arm but I could not see it because my eyes were locked with his. \"Are you happy?\" he asked again and I did everything in my power to keep from tearing. \"Why are you asking all these things to me?\" \"I just want to know…\" \"Look\" I cutted him again \"I don't know what you want…but I'm fine. And even if there was someone im ny life, even if that person was the roadkil driver or a drug dealer it's non of your bussiness\" My last words were a little harsh but he didn't seem to quit. \"Non of my bussiness?\" he asked dissapointed but I could not say if he was sad or angry. \"Sabi, you are my friend. I just care about you and you know that\" He sounded so sincere and his voice was so sweet that I felt the urge to ruffle his curly hair and kiss him on his lips. But I decide not to budge, to let all the feelings I had for him reveal. \"Dalt, just care abou t yourself, about your life. You have a girlfriend who might…\" \"Yes I know but we don't know for sure and that does not stop me from having a heart for you. Halt this stupid joke. If you don't want to be around me anymore I will not bother you again. But I want you to know that… I love you…and I mean I really love you, not like a friend. I want to be with you. I don't know what I'm gonna do with Mary but I don't care. That's what I feel. And responsibilities don't change my true feelings\" I felt my heart beating too fast for my body which was almost shaking. \"Dalton I…\" I started but I saw Bo coming so I left my phrase incomplete and a Dalton awaiting something with so much passion. I didn't want to leave him dissapointed but I could also not reveal him that I loved him in front of a stranger. \"So didn't you wait much, did you?\" Bo asked and I shook my head no. \"I forgot to ask you about the fanbelt of your car, I mean I want to know the right size in case this is the problem\" \"I don't know… Dalton?\" I asked hoping that he knew the size. \"I think it's a 15 or 16 inch\" He said and I sighed relieved. \"Alright I am quickly going to the house to grab it you can come with me if you want it will take a minute\" \"I'm coming\" Dalton said but I hold his sleeve \"No\" I whispered in his ear. \"I'll be fine I'm gonna help him and we'll come to take you\" He said and they started their way home. I sat down in front of the door of the gus station and I thought about what he said. He was right. I was a stubborn,silly person and I wanted everything to be in my own way. I had not the courage to admit I loved him but I could tell him. I could not tell the others but I could tell him. I needed him to know that I cared about him too. I needed him to know that I did want him to be around me. The time went by but Dalton and Bo didn't seem to come. I closed my eyes for a moment and when I opened them I saw them coming. No. I saw him coming. I could see Bo but not Dalton. I felt my body sweat. I immediately thought that something had happened. I had a feeling that Dalton was in danger. I stood up and I walked towards him. \"Where is my friend?\" I asked him nervously. \"Where do you think he is?\" He asked with an insidious look. \"I'm sorry what did you say? I asked him again when I felt his hand slapping my face. I fell to the ground from his hard motion and I hit my head. I saw him coming over me and he looked at me with a malicious glance. That was the last thing I remembered. REVIEWS REVIEWS REVIEWS (ARE WELCOME. LONG CHAPTER FOR A LONG WAITING. GETTING INSPIRATION TO RIGHT IS NOT THAT EASY ;)[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 I woke up and I realized that I was strapped to s a chair overcome by a headache. The lights in the room weren't helping because they were too much for my heavy head. I looked at the sadistic but at the same time charming predator in front of me while he was giving me a lustful look. I didn't know what he wanted. His thirsty lips and rapid breath revealed that he wanted to rape me but his eyes reflected pain and asked for revenge. So that was it. I felt my body yell in pain but I decided to stay quiet. Besides, I had no choice. He was stronger than I was. He was a beast. I knew that he hid something. But what? Oh please what I was thinking? He was going to kill me and he had probably hurt Dalton. Dalton… my god. I wish I had at least told him that I loved him. I wish I hadn't let him go. \"You are beautiful\" He said stroking my temple. \"You are a handsome man, too\" I paused \"but behind this attractive face you hide ugliness, of the most loathsome\" \"Tell me something that I don't know miss\" He calmly answered. \"You are brutal and cruel. Tell me what is wrong with you, and also tell me where the fuck is my friend!\" I said still worrying for my life. \"Shut up or I'll cut your tongue\" he dangerously approached and he looked at me straight in the eye. \"Doesn't it bother you? Tell me what is wrong with you. Maybe I could help you\" I suggested hoping that he finally would untie me. \"Nobody can help me darling…it's too late\" \"Tell me where my friend is and please…untie me please!\" \"Everything on time. Be patient\" \"Don't hurt my friend. Why are you doing this?\" I insisted but he didn't seem to care. \"I'm gonna go check on your little friend\" he grabbed his cap and headed to the door. \"Bo…\" he shut the door and I was left alone in the cold room waiting for the worst to happen. I looked at the untidy, filthy room and I examined the walls. There were plenty of photos and I could distinguish one with two boys. The one was probably Bo, but the other… he had a strange face and he seemed… different. Very different. Was he Bo's relative or maybe a victim. I closed my eyes as I sunk into a deep sleep… I know it is extremely short but I don't know exactly where this story goes. Do you want a happy end and Dalton and Sabina together ? Do you prefer her with Bo instead? I want your opinion[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Dalton's POV I woke up feeling my head extremely heavy. I ached so much but I had to stay strong for my Sabina. I tried to stand up when I suddenly heard a noise. I didn't even know where I was so I looked around me seeing nothing but dark. I turn my head a little bit and I spotted a little light coming from a chink. I quietly opened the old door and it was almost impossible to avoid causing noise. I hoped that Bo, that bastard, couldn't hear me. I went out of the room walking in silence but I could hear him coming upstairs. I quickly returned to the room desperately looking for something to fend. He surely came to check on me. He had probably hurt Sabina. \"Where are you, where are you little bastard…\" Bo's creepy voice intruded into the room. \"I know you are in her…\" he didn't have enough time to finish his sentence cause I hit him to the head with a tool. It might be one of those doctors use but I didn't care at all. All I wanted was to find Sabina and get the hell out of that place. I grabbed another tool in order to protect myself in case he came back to me. I wish Sabina was fine. I left the terrifying house and I ran to the gas station. I suddenly heard her voice. \"Dalton!\" She sounded hopeless. \"Sabi!\" I shouted back. \"Dalton! I'm downstairs!\" I quickly went down the stairs and I broke the door of the secret basement my angel was trapped. \"Sabina…\" I ran to her and I rapidly untied the restrains. She hugged me as if she was thinking that she wouldn't see me again. So did I. I was so happy that I held her again. I shouldn't have left her. Never. \"I thought I wouldn't see you again\" She whispered to my ear, her voice piercing my whole body. \"I thought I wouldn't touch you again\" I said and she looked at me like she never did. That moment I understood that her words earlier were lies. She loved me as much as I did. \"Where is he?\" She asked me still hold my hands. \"I hit him. He is at home. Let's go Sabina. Let's ran back to the campsite\" \"We have to be careful. Maybe there is someone else. Someone who helps him. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose you\" She finally confessed. \"I don't want to lose you either. Come. Time to go\" I said and she followed me ready to abandon that hell. \" I don't think we should harry. There is that freak that brought as here, remember?\" \"You are right. He must be with him. Maybe we should look for a place to hide\" \"Right\" \"Come with me. I saw a pet store when we made it to the town\" I suggested. \"But it's probably locked\" \"I could break the door\" We headed to the store hoping that we would find a place to be safe for a while. BACK TO THE CAMPSITE \"Where have they been?\" Carly asked sitting on Wade's lap. \"Maybe they didn't find what they need\" Wade answered kissing her cheek. \"I worry about them. What if some jerk attacked them?\" She asked her pretty face giving her boyfriend a sense of fear. \"Would you like to go find them?\" Wade asked wanting to please his little girl. \"Yes, please…\" She answered as if she was waiting for that question. \"Ok, then. Let the guys know and come. We need to take my car. They will still have Blake's in case they need it\" \"Paige\" Carly shouted at her blonde friend who was busy looking at some cd's \" We will go find them\" \"Is something wrong?\" she asked a little bit worried. \"I don't know, but to be honest I've started to worry about them\" Carly said picking up her cellphone. \"So they didn't call you?\" \"No\" \"They might be coming\" Paige insisted. \"Paige, we will be back. We are gonna find them and head back to the camp. \"All right\" She finally gave in. \"Carly is something wrong with Dalton?\" Maribel asked. \"I don't think so Mary\" Carly smiled not wanting to worry her. She gave a last look to her brother who was stubbornly staring at her all that time. \"Why do you always have to make things more serious than they really are?\" he finally said approaching her. The smoke of his cigarette and his ironic face made her wanna punch him but she preferred to ignore him. \"Go back to your friends Nick\" She eventually said heading to the red car Wade had already started.

This st"},{"Movie":"Merlin","Title":"Life","Author":"Halewyn's Lady","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13037198","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The essence to Merlin's Apprentice: Merlin thinks he was very drunk once…. This is a record of that time, relocated to a bar, in present time. Let me misquote: \"Oh, they hurt. Memories of alcohol, they hurt. Well, nothing can be done about that now. The arrow of time points in one direction.\" Lady/Merlin ahead, dive in at own risk. / He recognized her at once. She had changed her hair, she had been changing much about herself recently. She was the very person he wanted to see most and the last person he wanted to see. With the obvious exception of his mother. He would pick dying over facing mother right now. He had dropped out of college. He would fail his studies. The woman sitting there was his benefactor, in a way. She had encouraged him to pursue his studies, his love, everything, life. She gave him fundings and lavish gifts. He needed her advice desperately, like air to keep from suffocating. Sometimes he imagined she lived through him. Her own life always sounded empty to him. He watched the black boots she wore, high-heeled, uncommon for her. She often went out the door forgetting to put shoes on. She wasn't even wearing those sparkly white fingerless gloves she was so fond of. How many pairs of those had she owned? Were they all worn down? She sat exactly where he used to sit. Beer at hand and study book in front of him. This bar drew people, interesting people, and it breathed out atmosphere and a poet's inspiration. Not that he was a poet, but he liked the taste of poetry. Nimue did too, before she dumped him. He was lazy and never around when she needed him. He understood. It was true. How would he break this to his aunt? Telling her was almost equal to telling his mother. They were best friends, in an incomprehensible near-hostile way. They resembled each other, called each other sister too. Now that her hair was black as well, the ghostlike presence of his mother grew all the stronger. No, these thick tresses shone and waved. Her hair wasn't like his mom's at all. She was not. Her voice was entirely different and her personality even more so. He could count on her understanding. His mother will be furious when she finds out he didn't finish his studies. She was paying for his boarding. She would skin him. He would be lucky to get away only missing his skin. \"Viviane, what brings you here?\" He should not have asked that. He could bite his tongue for this. She did not look as though she had come looking for him. She was only a woman having a drink. Her eyes on the Celtic swirls decorating the wall. He could almost hear her wish for a folk tune to play. Maybe later it would. The bar tender had a tickle taste in music. \"Merlin,\" He could have sworn her cheeks flushed. \"dear student boy.\" She looked almost scared, as if not he, but his mother had discovered her here. Was she here in the hopes of picking someone up? His mother would disapprove, but then, she disapproved of most things. \"Please call me Vivi, Viviane makes me feel old.\" \"Don't be silly. You are young.\" \"It is different for women. You'll learn.\" She paused wistfully. \"You cut your hair.\" She smiled, firmly holding her glass, droplets condense tricked down over her fingers. \"My student days are over.\" His voice of inevitable doom and death. Their family always was one for being dramatic. \"Tell me more.\" \"I would have called…\" It's been days, weeks, since he attended lessons. \"Sit down and tell me now. I won't judge.\" \"I know.\" She tilted her head. \"You are worried about your mother.\" \"Yes.\" \"She'll hate you for this.\" \"I know.\" He looked defeated. \"I am making a living, a future for myself. I am developing a freelance project. We call it Camelot.\" \"We?\" \"Myself and a group of friends. Arthur does most of the work, under my supervision. I am his mentor.\" \"How old is Arthur that you can be his mentor?\" A pause. \"He's not left high school yet, but he'll do great things, I know it. He is just what the world needs.\" His hand gestures were all over the place, indicating to her that he too probably already had something to drink before entering this lowly drinking cavern. She allowed herself a deep drink, downing her glass in one swoop, thinking she needed it. \"Are you for drinking?\" \"Excuse me?\" He reached to scratch the back of his neck, embarrassed. \"Err sorry, I meant can I buy you a drink? What would you like?\" \"That is very kind of you.\" \"I've only ever seen you drink water.\" \"Could have been vodka.\" \"It wasn't. I know you, Vivia... Vivi.\" Her empty glass had most certainly not contained anything close to water. So there were more sides to her than he knew of. That is what makes life interesting. \"This is my usual dwelling.\" It felt like him, a stretch of forest in a crowded world. \"Is it? I liked the sign outside, before you walk down the stairs..\" into the filth, into the cool cavernous space that is this bar. \"The sword.\" He knew her to be superstitious. She believed in signs. A sword must mean something specific to her. She let her private symbolism guide her. \"Yes. This place is called Excalibar. It's a pun… it's…\" \"silly.\" \"Yeah. There was supposedly this woman in a lake and she handed a man a sword, to make him king, I think.\" \"I know the story.\" \"I wish I were a better storyteller.\" He was still not sitting down. And he was beginning to explain to her the best known legend in the world out of sheer despair, but it all sounded too adorable for her to be annoyed. \"Am I making you uncomfortable?\" \"You couldn't.\" Hell, she could. He had never seen her like this before. He only ever saw her in soft colours, in the cold light of his family home, her pastel shaded make-up, light pink lips now a deep red. He involuntarily felt his knees weaken when she smiled. He gripped the chair, for his dear life, and sat down. \"I like your other style better. It is more… you.\" His hands fidgeting in his lap, like that nervous nerdie Frik. \"Oh.\" For a moment she looked as though she would take her napkin and wipe the red from her lips. She then, decidedly, did not. The smoky shadows of the bar enveloped her, they hid her face almost as well as her hair did. He reached out, brushed the hair away. He was fed up with women hiding, he got enough of that with Nimue. She shivered. He did not understand. \"Merlin, you shouldn't…\" Her voice hoarse, not as light and luminescent as he was used to. Its counseling streak was also gone. He had caught her here, what he had considered to be strange waters to her. Evidently he'd been wrong. He never was a good judge of people. \"Is Nimue… well?\" His girlfriend's confidence had never recovered from meeting his mother. Merlin had known she would not approve. Nimue took it personal. Viviane had borne witness to all her sister's complaints, irks and grievances about the girl. \"She is gone.\" \"I am sorry.\" Viviane placed her hand on his. It was peculiar in the sense that he had never noticed how often she shied away from physical contact until now when she did touch him. His entire family was not of the huggy kind. \"I… another drink.\" She agreed. He was on his seventh glass, - somehow the glasses hadn't gone up even. It was only her fifth. – when she kissed him. She did not become embarrassed. Had he expected her to? Girls often did. He was easily led when drunk. She almost enjoyed having this power over him. As sweat dripped slowly from the ceiling of the bar and the air inside had grown sharp drowning in muddled liquored breaths, she decided it was time to leave. He was hopeless when it came to directions. They did find his rooms, in the end. Long after she had taken off her shoes, which had become painful to her feet, and after that street where he stopped every few paces to kiss her as though his life depended on her alone. \"Aren't you too drunk?\" she whispered. \"No.\" he called. \"No!\" resting his head against a cool surface. \"I am too drunk, but not too drunk to adore you. Look at this lamppost, it's beautiful. And. So. Are. You.\" \"Hey lady!\" Another drunken voice. \"Is that guy bothering you?\" \"Mind your own business.\" she called back. His rooms were a second kind of cave. She put on the lights, clear white ones. She stripped to her underwear. He could barely get out of his clothes, she stopped helping him, they had taken enough off for him to be serviceable to her and at least he was enthusiastic, if not very mobile. She lay him on the bed. She freely enjoyed what happened there, taking her desires. When he woke, she had left. There was a blasting headache in her place and precious little recollection of the previous night. A week or two later, in which time he met up with his friends and continued building up Camelot, his memory was jolted into action. There was a text. \"Are you alone?\" \"Yes, cooped up in my student room.\" Where you left me… He only went home on weekends. He was staying here for as long as he could to avoid his mother's wrath. He had officially quit, she knew, and somehow his skin was still intact. \"Do not tell your mother.\" \"Wasn't planning to.\" She sounded secretive, as ever. But then one had to be when acquainted with his mother who was known for her temper. She smashed any objects to the floor. You didn't want her to repeat last year's fatal phone crash, which had occurred upon receiving a text she hadn't liked, not on her own phone. That \"swine Vortigern\" offering to pay her for a lap dance. Merlin still missed that phone. \"I am pregnant.\" \"Are you… keeping it?\" \"Yes. Do not tell your mother it is yours.\" It is mine? His head pounded all of a sudden. That is impossible. \"Will I have to… marry you?\" \"No, Merlin.\" Such a boy still. \"Will I see you again?\" / -Meet me at the lake.- Creating a child had been her purpose to going out in the first place. The much needed change to her existence. He did not need to know that. All she had needed was a sword.[Chapter 2] Oh yes, there is a sequel. I am calling it Life 2, Life's Apprentice, horrid title isn't it? I am submitting this for next month's challenge Lies. We will begin with a Merlin's Apprentice quote from Merlin himself: \"Still you have an advantage, you have me.\" cue hopeless smile. / As soon as Mab opened the door to her friend, she noticed. \"By all that is purple!\" She liked purple: clothes, prose, every single wall in the house. \"WHY?\" One word, the most exasperated sound. \"How can you be so stupid?\" The word stupid also took on a typical her-inflection. She let the pregnant lady in. Merlin hadn't expected her to. His mother didn't take change well. In most cases she would have closed the door and rescheduled for when it suited her better. Merlin was confined to the next room, his private 'chambers', a bedroom and study. Both lorded over by his mother. As everything in this house. They were of her design and clearly reflected her aspirations for him. He longed back for his student lodgings. Viviane had come to inform his mother. This was too soon for Merlin. He believed himself unfortunate to be stuck at home and have to hear this conversation. He imagined the soft curve to Viviane's stomach. Her pregnancy was not showing all that clearly yet. Merlin knew what that curve looked like in her flesh. It was beautiful. He heard his mother opening the cupboard. She was either coming to terms with the idea of her friend's pregnancy or opting to ignore it all together in the future. His mother selected extra packs of biscuits while she pondered her dilemma over. Merlin emerged to take a few for his own. Viviane was sitting down. The white gloves were back. Nervous, in her lap. She did not look up. By the care his mother took in displaying the biscuits, Merlin could tell Mab was trying to act compassionate towards her friend. He took a handful of chocolate covered biscuits and went back to his room. It was just two friends together now. \"Well,\" Mab breathed, placing her tea cup down \"sister\", a sneer. \"You hated it when I was expecting a child, so in all fairness I should serve you as you did me all those years ago by not talking with you for years...\" A self-satisfied smirk. \"Your situation was different from mine. \" \"I don't see how.\" \"You don't even like men. You convinced your then-girlfriend to bear a child for you.\" It was not even going to be the girlfriend's own child. The egg had been Mab's. Mab had called it magic. Her egg and the semen she picked from an anonymous donor, the father might as well not exist. Merlin cringed, he hated this story. Most of his fights with his mother centered around this topic, and most of his talks with Viviane too. Viviane had disapproved of the plan as soon as she heard. She doubted Mab told anyone else. It was not legal. Not illegal either, as Mab frequently pointed out. She did not know Mab had worked it. To get everyone at the hospitable so crazy to follow her madness. Of course by then Mab no longer kept her informed of the proceedings. Her sister was secretive by nature. Viviane could only assume there had been endless screenings, tests for Mab and her girlfriend to partake in to get their request approved medically, psychologically, ethically,… . She wondered if Mab ever tried herself to carry a child, implanted or otherwise. Logically if it had been possible for Mab to have a child herself her carrier-mother plan would have been denied. Viviane could only assume there was something wrong with her friend's womb. Viviane regretted she had left their friendship adrift back then and Mab had never truly forgiven her for her disapproval. \"And then you dumped her, as you had calculated all along.\" \"I fail to see my 'fault'.\" \"You ruined her.\" \"Oh yes why don't you blame me for the umptieth time, it's all you and Merlin ever do. \" And Merlin, his mother did not know how he worried about his conception, the self-hatred he carried. Viviane had to breathe, keep her criticism in. This was her best friend. A best friend who made friendship inhumanly difficult. She did not want to fall out with her friend all over again. Mab had had her child. Whoever got hurt, she had gotten exactly what she wanted. Viviane's heart sank. She was going down the same path. She prayed she would not mess up motherhood quite as badly as she believed her best friend to have done. Once Viviane said to her sister: 'You are the one who drove made your girlfriend mad.' She would not say so again. It just slipped out, quite intentionally, in anger, once. It had ended with Merlin crying in the basement and Viviane sitting by him for hours. No lights there, but for the faint glow of her white dress. To reconcile that Merlin with how she knew him was surprisingly easy. \"Who,\" Mab nudged her head in Viviane's direction with obvious discomfort. \"is the father? \"Just someone I met.\" \"With a penis, disgusting.\" She bit her biscuit. \"That really narrows it down. Married?\" \"I believe so. It was a one night thing.\" \"At least there is that. You don't want some the father meddling in this. \" Mab threw a pack of biscuits at Merlin. He had been dwelling in the room again, overstaying his welcome in his mother's opinion. \"Here, these are yours, now stay out.\" Typical. Lady started, \"Is… he…\" \"Majorly depressed about having lost the war that is higher education and moping about endlessly, yes, urrg I don't know what is up with that boy, there is always something. He never focuses on what he should. First in pink fluffy spheres over Niiiiimueeee, now over some sprite named Arthur, I mean honestly, has he inherited none of my taste? My words are but air to him, particularly when I talk about the future, life decisions, all that fun stuff. He shuts me out. He listens to you, heck, he'd follow you blindly… The boy idolizes you. You should talk to him.\" Merlin's mother shrugged when Vivi didn't answer. Viviane could entreat entry to his chambers later, he would let her in. Mab would tell her roughly what to say. He would hear her advice and express no questions to her integrity, no hesitations, he would trust Viviane instantly and always, as he always did. Her sister usually offered to help right away. She did not seem up to it now. She had problems of her own. \"It's early, you could still lose it.\" \"I am hoping I won't.\" \"Oh you have the ambition of a cuttlefish!\" Nonsensical comparisons were his mother's thing. It was best not to dwell on them. He imagined the look on Vivi's face had either gone very dark or very unexpressive. \"You are envious because I know what I want and you never do. Only now it occurs to you that hey, you wanted a child all along. Try to think big, for once in your life, …\" She cast a meaningful look. What did she want? \"…get the father to pay his share.\" \"Look, I doubt he remembers. \" His mother leeringly leaned forward, and corrected her in a sharp whisper. \"No, you don't want to tax him.\" \"It is MY child, not his. I'd prefer him not to know. If I could keep it a secret forever I would.\" \"So you did tell him?\" \"I texted him.\" \"Great gods, Vivi! You don't text something like that. \" \"It seemed the best way.\" The least intrusive way. She shouldn't have told him, she hadn't planned to and suddenly phone in her hand, there it had been: text and sent. She had had to tell him because he knew her, he would see her, he would notice and grow concerned. He would already have barged into this room if she hadn't. \"What did he say. Well?\" \"Nothing, really.\" They met up by the lake and in her flat. She had asked him to be there. They had kissed, talked, slept together. A couple of times. They had shared a bath. Merlin had attempted to broach the topic of her pregnancy on several occasions, she had turned away. Once had been during that bath, his arms resting on her abdomen as he held her. Solemnly he declared \"He is conceived.\" She plashed him with water. When she was drying herself off, he handed her a towel and dried her hair for her. \"See, you need me.\" \"I need you? How do I need you?\" She turned around, hesitantly, he held her in his arms again. \"You need me, to take care of this child. I would be a good father.\" She walked away, she did not speak or say 'no' or shake her head. She might as well have given him his death warrant. \"Thank you.\" she had said, softly, from the bedroom. There had been a dark ghost to her voice from then on whenever she spoke to him. He did not like hearing her tainted by this remorse-like echo. Mab tutted. \"Do you have to be so withdrawn and polite? You are too kind, it just isn't healthy.\" He kicked the wall to his rooms. He thought of that time, overpowered again, by the wish of running away, getting out. His most hopeful memory. That time when he fled down to the sparkly cellar and she had come to comfort him. He had never minded letting her see him when he felt him defeated. She always helped him. It was the time Viviane first mentioned his birthmother and her mental state. She had partly blamed Mab. Merlin had sworn revenge on his mother. He had said he would run away from home. He told her then of his escape plan. She had been included in his plan. Everyone he cared about had a place in his plot. How foolish those plans were. The unhappy child who wanted to run away. Vivi had stayed and sat with him. She hadn't objected or rationalized his plans. She listened to them all. Then she suggested something better, he should look for the woman who carried him all those years ago. Viviane helped him find his birthmother. In this moment in his room he sensed the same disillusion with the world as he had felt then. He realized he still intended to run away. 'I'll leave home', the mature expression for it. He wanted to do so now, run away in secret with her. \"Vivi, Vivi, wait!\" Merlin burst out of his room. \"I am going to visit my birthmother, can you give me a lift?\" She did not reply, she held the door open for him to exit first. He dashed past his mother hastily pressing a kiss to Mab's cheek. That was uncommon. He did not start babbling forth all his woes to Viviane at once. Another oddity. His mother had expected him to ask to talk with her alone in the solitude of his hut. She wondered if her sister had, if but slightly, lost her idol status. She had been knocked off her pedestal. By what? The only thing that had changed was the pregnancy. It seemed unlike Merlin to judge her for that. But then he could be, very, judgy. He walked silent, in an eager sort of pace. So her glow had not dimmed to him after all. He looked slightly off, how he leaned to Viviane and carefully kept his distance too, an awkward puppy to her heels. A hissing dread came upon Mab, followed directly by a resolute \"NO.\" / Vivi dropped him off at his mother's house. She was not going with him, she had groceries to do and would come back to pick him up. Before Merlin got out of the car he leaned over and kissed her. A distracted silent look came over her. It held we-will-talk-about-this-later-implications. It was a guilty look. He had seen that look only once before. Late at night in her flat, when she had been half asleep against him, right after she had told him that she cared for no one as deeply as him. Now she said slowly, soft and deliberate. \" You can't really… do that.\" She could not force herself to speak any faster, not with subjects that really matter to her. It was impossible for her. She needed to weigh words. If she was going to patiently explain her behaviour to him later, he did not want her to. He got out of the car and ran to his mother's house. Ambrosia answered the door. She was his mother's nurse. She had known him since he had found his birthmother. She had known his other mother and her sister that long too. Ambrosia was in many ways more a mother to him than either of his mothers. He thought Ambrosia would understand. Mab's ex was of a fragile heart and mind. She was often unavailable to him. This time too, Ambrosia informed him of the new medication that his birthmother had to get used to. It made her sleep for most of the day. It would be best not to disturb her. \"Ambrosia, I am in love!\" declared Merlin. \"I remember the last time you said that.\" She provided him with an insincere warning look. \"It is different from last time. I saw her at my bar and we talked and we went to the lake together and her thighs… have I told you about…\" \"No, you haven't and I don't need you to. I don't need to know about any lady's thighs. But I am very happy for you. Help me change the sheets.\" He enjoyed helping the full-time nurse out with household chores. \"And other news. Viviane's pregnant. She gave me a lift.\" She liked Viviane, Viviane had helped her out during breakdowns, of both his mothers. Ambrosia had once commented that Vivi had the patience an angel. Which to her knowledge was as useful a thing as it was harmful. Merlin looked at her for a while, not moving. \"Oh Merlin, her?\" He smiled, then his smile fell when she did react quite as he had hoped. \"Viviane has never committed to anything in her life. She is half out there living in another world. She can't keep a job and she can't keep an aquarium.\" They all knew Viviane was caught in an eternal struggle to keep her fish alive. She forgets to clean the aquarium. He had seen her calendar. The days she had to do that chore were marked in thick red marker visualizing the urgency of a battle to be fought. Then I'll take care of the fish, Merlin thought, viciously. I will clean her aquarium. He swore to it. \"My mother wasn't thrilled either. About the pregnancy, we haven't told her more.\" \"You'll want to keep that pain-in-the-back far away from it. Dear boy, I love Vivi dearly. I hold her in far higher regard than …\" the horror… it was coming… his mother… Mab again.\" I hate to agree with Mab but she'd make a neglectful parent.\" \"You think it is that bad?\" \"Well, yes.\" His eyes welled up. He sobbed suddenly. Ambrosia hugged him. \"It is not going to be a complete disaster. If you can keep mom at bay. It is just that… Vivi likes to be alone, prefers to be alone. I think. She want to be free to read her esoteric magazines or whatever it is she does, unashamed and in peace. She wants you to make something of your life, for yourself. She is a grown woman, she must take care of her own life and you must take care of yours. Of course she makes mistakes too, everyone does.\" \"I am not a mistake, that night wasn't a mistake.\" \"No, you aren't but you are precious. We all want what is best for you.\" \"I really like her… we were friends …\" \"It is not just about your feelings. Please reconsider, Merlin. Love is fleeting, it's okay. That is just how life is. Emotions are fluid.\" She looked at him, with her concerned wise eyes. \"Has she told you she loves you?\" \"Well no, not in so many words, but close to it. She is just being careful.\" \"Life's not made to be lived halfheartedly. If she quiets her feelings down there must be a reason. One that can't bode well for you.\" \"What if you are right? Then what?\" \"About what?\" \"If she can't raise a child?\" \"Have it up for adoption. \"I won't accept that.\" \"There is nothing you can do, not yet. I'll just say, I'd be surprise if she succeeds in keeping it until it is out of diapers. Don't look so glum. It is her child. Not yours. Remember that. It will help you through this.\" But it is mine. His mind kept repeating and he couldn't turn it off. When Viviane arrived, she remained standing next to her car. As if not to disturb her surroundings too much. She called from afar, offering a polite hallo to Ambrosia. A silver car and a matching dress, so they would not clash. She would neverever quite realise silvers and whites do stand out. Merlin got in car and Ambrosia waved him goodbye. Viviane's rueful eyes were shrouded in mist on the drive back. He tried to talk with her, but she had distanced herself. It felt as if she existed behind glass. He could not reach. Not until she reached out first, a few words, no words came, a hand then, when she had parked the car, one faintly gloved hand rested between them which he took and held with as much love as he could. She did not expand upon that hand, it drew away again, she retreated completely under the icy surface. His chance closed before his eyes. Her ice now solid as a mountain, it was no use pounding upon her walls. He got out of the car. Without a kiss. / The party to launch Camelot was there before he truly noticed. There had been no sign from Viviane in the days preceding it. Yet she was there. From the audience she looked at him, tender, proud and shining, exactly as before, when they hadn't been… lovers, enemies? When they had guided and admired each other. She was silent, as she had always been, his supportive semi-aunt. If she did not wish to meet again, he was fairly certain by now she did not, he would respect her wishes. If she did not want him in her life, not like that, he would respect her wishes too. If she was letting him go out to live his life, he would respect her wishes, and be hopelessly lost. When his project presentation was over he looked for her. Some fancy struck him that she would affectionately stoke his hair back when congratulating him. She only offered him words. Fairly standard ones. Standing beside him, not touching. She did not feel the inclination to. He glossed over the tranquil pastel colours she wore, her make-up a matching soft pastel with faint traces of glitter on her cheeks. This style of make-up often matched Mab's. It was a best friends thing. He did not offer her a kiss. She would not want one. There was nothing dubious between them. Apart from the child, between them, within her. She moved to walk away. Then his mother arrived, in the tumult of the after party. Fashionably late she crashed in as a lightning strike and handed him a small gift. She had a knack for destructive presents. He knew it couldn't possibly be something nice. He unwrapped the package anyway. A box of condoms. When he looked up, far too accustomed to his mother's antics to provide her with much of a reaction, she had already intercepted Viviane, gotten a hold of her, pulling her swiftly away. He could not get himself to say a word, to voice some warning, to take a step in their wake, Vivi looked in his direction, then cast her eyes down immediately as Mab spoke. \"How ingenious of you to combine this with the baby shower,\" he overheard his mother comment to her. \"you couldn't let such an opportunity go.\" He could not catch the rest. The sisters walked out of his view. He continued to linger in the company of friends. Out of nowhere his mother reappeared and planted herself firmly in front of him. \"I know you like her, \" she mockingly tilted her head. \" and she is my best friend, but whatever do you see in her? I mean… she is such a wet blanket. But then you like that don't you? Anyway, there is someone …\" She peered, plucked an unfortunate out of the crowd and put this person by her side. \"ah here is my date.\" She locked arms with Nimue. Nimue stood proud. She looked unscarred by past insecurities. Ironically healed, somehow, by his mother? From wounds brought on by Mab in the first place! \"You steal my friend, I steal yours.\" \"You were never a couple with Vivi.\" \"Says who? Sanctimonious Viv? Don't you know her by now?\" Merlin was going to be sick. She could not be serious. \"Always omitting, masking, painting facts as vaguely as possible. It is her to the T. She is transparent as water and never clear at all. Her psyche are the murkiest waters. Have you ever tried getting directions from her? It's like something out of a fairy story. 'Oh you failed to recognize what I described as a 'luminescent sun' for a tacky bright red fast-food billboard and missed your turn because of this unintentional misdirection? I feel sad for you.' Viviane.\" Best friends, how on earth were these women best friends? \"But yes, Merlin, before you even entered the picture …\" He was going to be sick. \"there was much loveliness going on….between us …\" He was going to be tremendously sick in a discreet place. A mere minute from now. As he gazed upon his mother's triumphant smile, Merlin's common sense kicked in. \"You lie.\" It sounded loud and clear within his mind. \"You're a liar.\" \"Well, it was gorgeous. Then Vivi had to go and believe she was straight all of a sudden. She is always trying so very hard to be dull, isn't she?\" \"You are still lying.\" \"Maybe, Merlin, maybe. It was worth a shot. The point is…\" \"Oh is there a point?\" \"You are my son and while she may not have been interested in me, loo and behold what happens when I have a son…\" \"We are nothing alike.\" Mab shrugged. She was allowed to make things up for her son's your wellbeing. \"I was doing you a favour.\" Satisfied as can be she continued \"Imagine how embarrassing would it be if we had dated.\" \"You scared the shit out of me.\" He spent the rest of his great evening hating his mother. He should have guessed he would. It is how most meaningful events played out for him. Mab, my mother, he saw her talking with other people, she asked in that tone of voice that could carry to the furthest reaches of the room \"You think I should kiss her?\". Nimue threw her head back, smiling, \"Do it, Mab.\" and Mab did. Perhaps he was still going to be sick. Merlin left his party early. It hardly felt like his party anymore. Mab threw him a most gleeful smile. She should get awards for her performance. He watched Arthur and his friends from a distance. Arthur and a girl with sloppy braids who he seemed intent on impressing. Best leave them here. While they were happy. He left the box of condoms behind for those in more celebrational spirits than him. He hadn't found Viviane. As he walked home he daydreamed, nightdreamed, about what it would be like to hold a baby, his baby. A small wet wriggly newborn. Perhaps he could call it Carb, or some other fish. More earnestly he thought, if a boy Jack, if a girl Jack. It was very unlikely he was going to have a say in the child's name. To hold a baby in his arms and spin it around careful as can be. / Mab handed him a mug in the morning containing his regular coffee. The word DAD was imprinted on the mug. She wanted him to know without a doubt that she knew. She couldn't and wouldn't wipe a teasing smile off her face. \"Very funny.\" \"Well if you want to be a humungous idiot you need to suffer the consequences. Oh, and Nimue stayed over. So you know and don't freak out when you see her.\" She playfully tapped the kitchen counter, determined to grate his nerves. She looked far too pleased. \"You never allowed her to stay over before.\" She pointedly stated, \"That was when she was with you. I trust me more than I trust you.\" She was leaning against the counter, drinking her first coffee, she sighed. \"It's good to be queen.\" She was looking forward to what lay in store for her today. He turned accusingly. \"You didn't like Nimue. You called her names.\" \"I didn't like her for you.\" She drawled as if he was being silly. \"Try to and treat her well.\" he grumbled. His mother wore that dark gaze he knew too well. \"All things change, Merlin. You shouldn't blame me.\" Mab winked and left, leaving him to his misery and coffee. / Camelot was a success, if not a lucrative one. Meeting up with Viviane was no success. For weeks she did not answer his calls. She had disappeared. Her silence was like poison to him. If his mother was behind this, he feared she would stay away forever. / \"Wake up, Merlin.\" His mother. \"She used you. That is all it was.\" Merlin groaned, pulled the pillow over his head. \"Leave me alone. Let me make my own life.\" Mistakes… I am only human. Mostly human and partly an experiment of 'magic' crafted by his mother. Gods, that voice in the distant kitchen, that was not Nimue again, it was, he knew. \"Get up. Get a grip. Stop fucking my sister and be happy.\" Yeah, that is what got him into this state. He stopped seeing her. He needed her. And she? She was being her composed mystical self. If she was sad she wouldn't tell him. She would go on as nature led her, have the child, take a shine to motherhood, or not. Report everything to his mother every month of the year. He would never have to see her again, only hear her voice trickle through the wall like a dream. He returned to Excalibar at least once a week to remember and forget, about school, and to get away from home. It was well worth the extra time to get there. He liked it there. It was his comfort. He hadn't met a single interesting person there since whatever-it-was happened. This evening promised to be no better. The fog machine was blowing a thick smoke around, mood lights were lit, there were too few people here to create the party atmosphere the bar was going for this night. It felt good to him, this quiet dark and the sense of something, not quite here yet. He watched the lights in the flood, a dim red-orange flaring up every few seconds, he knew not for how long. Come to think of it, the smoke smelled quite faul. It was too early and the mood of the bar would change again when more people were here, for now, he enjoyed this. He did not watched the people, there was no other like her. He saw her, his eyes followed her through the smoke, on to the battlefield, where she wore bright blue. She was not drinking, not even a glass of water in her hand. He imagined their child aiding him on his quest to have courage, to approach her, to see her and keep him cloaked from her sight. Just let me see her. He heard the call of his child in her. She sensed him too. He should retreat, retreat before she turned and he was paralyzed by her. The moment, that moment, she would see him slain. She was flanked by some barbarian to his eyes. An adult, not a student, someone with his life figured out. Someone drunk and willing by the look of it, though she did not look or act as though she was interested. She easily tore herself away from a dispassionate conversation. As she slowly approached towards him, a great glow as a brazier fired up behind her. It burned the mist. Never had time moved more slowly to him. She was not wearing the boots, she had on similar make-up as when they first met here… \"Why are you here?\" he asked her. She wanted to whisper 'Go home Merlin'. Viviane had cried and grown apathic. She had gone to this bar, where … \"I hoped to find you. I am not certain why I am here. I think I am either supposed to be here or I want to be here. I kept seeing you, walking by by the lake, when you weren't there. I thought I might as well go out and imagine seeing you here.\" \"I am tired of being enemies.\" He said. \"I was not aware that we were being enemies. I enjoy having you in my life. You are always most welcome.\" She had especially enjoyed him in her bed, but that could not go on. She would feel as if she was keeping him prisoner, for years and years. \"I didn't know if you would be here. It is far away from your home…\" \"You couldn't text?\" She could not get herself to text him or visit him at his mother's house. This had been her only way to reach him. She did not know how to explain this to him. \"I regret this is how we must end.\" \"It does not end, Viviane.\" For a moment he thought she would leave at that and walk away with the barbarian for the night, kill Merlin clean in that act. It would be a form of mercy. A soft, humane solution to being rid of him. He could see her be that practical about his execution. But the barbarian had been clearly dismissed. \"Don't let it end, if you don't want to.\" She thought of how she hadn't expected herself to love having him in her flat as much as she did. She thought of how she had wanted him to stay there for more than a couple of nights and of how she had told herself 'you can't keep a human being as a pet no matter how nice he looks relaxed and sprawled out asleep on your couch.' \"Do you want it to end?\" She shook her head. \"Then don't let it.\" \"Viviane,\" he said, taking her gently by the arm. If one moment they were enemies, they would become strangers next. He would not let that happen. \"I really, undrunkenly, do, love you.\" She did not understand. There was nothing she could do to help. What did he wish her to do? Her expression settled back on her 'You are troubled again.' look. \"I am not troubled. I know one thing that is certain in all my life. And this is it. You.\" She startled by this phrase. A cliché so silly. \"What do you want me to do? I will work from home, do household chores, let me do the disches with you and walks to the lake, just share some time with me, please, I do not have to live with you. Once an week I'll come over and I'll clean for you.\" A peaceful look lay over her, it was the her he knew so well. She raised a hand, touched his face. As if to check that he was of human flesh, to check if he was her ally in this war. He was so beautiful. This boy, too pure of heart for his own good. \"You should not settle for my polluted life.\" \"I've always known you are a mess. I know you try hard not to show it, but it is obvious. I am a mess too.\" He was always going back and forth between things and often getting nowhere with anything. That was what she was like, he was the same. As least the intentions were there, the ambitions and naïve wishes. \"You should love someone of your own age and spirit.\" \"Nimue?\" He laughed, could not help it. \"She is dating my mom. \"Look, I am 24, I am not a child. I know I can do this.\" \"If you want … buy me a drink and I'll advise on how to proceed.\" Matters of the heart are a tricky and volatile business. Merlin did not wish to leave room for miscommunication. He would not have Viviane's sparse usage of words and evasive nature work against her. Or his own for that matter. It had been no mistake, she thought, when she told him that night how much she cared for him. If those words had sealed her fate now, she would not regret it. \"Do you think it meant something that I chose you to be the father?\" \"It means something that you would rather do this with me than without me.\" \"'This' being the child?\" \"Yes, that is how you feel, isn't it?\" \"I avoid thinking about what I feel as much as I can. I have never liked thinking about my feelings.\" She turned away for a moment, turned again, gave him a demure kiss. \"I do want you with me in this moment and that might mean something.\" He felt swept away already. \"I want to run away from home. Again.\" \"You should. Would you like my help?\" \"I would like nothing more.\" \"It will look suspicious if you go with me now.\" \"I don't mind.\" \"I decide on the child, the name, how it is raised, everything is in my hands.\" \"It is your child. Just don't give it up for adoption just yet.\" \"It has to be born first, Merlin.\" She studied his face. \"You can stay until I know I can do this.\" \"Take care of a child? Agreed.\" \"I am not good at being a proper girlfriend.\" \"We don't have to attach a label to it, Vivi, unless you want to.\" He kept holding her pale, glitter-glistening hand. / Look at that, I wrote a fluff-ish romance. Pining Merlin is best Merlin? How tempted was I to put \"Viviane in the vicinity of her vehicle\"? Very. ","Summary":" The essence to Merlin's Apprentice: Merlin thinks he was very drunk once….

Dia tahu diri dikeluarga ini. Dia hanya anak angkat. Dia tidak pernah meminta. Dia juga tidak pernah menolak. Dia selalu mengalah. Tapi, untuk masalah satu ini.. bolehkan jika ia menolaknya? Dia ingin egois sekarang. Tidak. Jika dia menolaknya, maka kakaknya yang akan tersiksa nantinya. Lebih baik jika dia yang tersiksa. \"Jongin.. Mobil jemputanmu sudah datang.\" Itu suara kakak sulungnya. Jongin mengusap kasar wajahnya. \"Aku sedang berkemas.\" Ucapnya parau. Dia mulai berkemas, membawa barang seperlunya. Setelah selesai, dia turun membawa tas ransel yang cukup besar. Ada dua orang asing yang duduk bersama keluarganya. Saat menyadari kehadiran Kai, mereka berdiri. Kedua orang asing itu keluar terlebih dulu, memberi Kai kesempatan untuk berpamitan pada keluarganya. \"Baik-baiklah kau disana. Tuan besar tidak sejahat yang kau pikirkan.\" Ayahnya memberi petuah. \"Aku akan baik-baik saja, aku hanya akan dijadikan pembantu disana.\" Kakak sulungnya memukulnya keras, kakak keduanya mengikuti yang si sulung lakukan. \"Kami akan rindu memukulmu seperti ini.\" Ucap mereka bersama, lalu memeluk Jongin. \"Bertahanlah sebentar. Setelah kami melunasi hutang, kau akan terbebas dari sana.\" Ibunya menenangkan. Jongin hanya mengangguk lalu keluar, dia tidak ingin berada disini dalam waktu lama. Nanti dia malah menangis lagi. Jongin turun dari mobil. Dia sudah sampai di 'penjara'nya. Tempat ini bagaikan istana. Lapangannya luas, mungkin luasnya menyamai lapangan golf atau bahkan lebih. Jongin mengikuti dua orang yang menjemputnya tadi. Mereka sampai di tempat latihan menembak. Ada banyak orang disana, orang yang cukup menyeramkan bagi Jongin. Ada dua orang yang sedang latihan menembak. Satunya bertelinga caplang dan tampan, sesekali ia tertawa bahagia saat tembakannya tepat sasaran. Satu lagi, Jongin tidak bisa menjabarkan wajah orang itu. Orang itu memakai masker yang menutupi wajahnya, hanya matanya yang terlihat. Sorot matanya... Dingin. Orang itu meletakkan pistolnya. Mengambil minuman yang sudah disediakan, meminumnya sambil berjalan menuju Jongin. Si caplang hanya memperhatikan dari jauh. Jongin menunduk, takut dengan tatapan itu. Itu terlalu mengintimidasi dirinya. Sebuah tangan mengangkat dagunya, membuatnya mendongak. Matanya bertemu dengan mata itu, mata yang menurutnya dingin namun kosong. Orang itu mengamati wajah Jongin dalam diam. Seperti ada magnet diwajah Jongin yang membuatnya enggan berpaling. \"Tuan, dia anak dari Kim Junho.\" Orang itu hanya mengangguk kecil. Dia berjalan meninggalkan Kai. \"Tempatkan dia dikamarku.\" Jongin kembali mengikuti orang yang menjemputnya tadi. Ingin menunjukkan kamar Jongin katanya. Kamar Jongin ada dilantai dua, di sebelah kanan tangga. Jongin dibiarkan sendiri memasuki kamarnya. Jongin melongo dengan kamarnya, ini amat luas, bahkan ada dapur kecil lengkap dengan meja makan disini. Jongin terdiam. Bukankah ayah dan ibu bilang ia akan dijadikan tawanan selama mereka belum membayar hutang? Lalu, ini apa? Kenapa jadi tawanan semewah ini hidupnya? Sekarang hampir waktu makan malam. Tapi Jongin masih tertidur. Bukan tidur dikasur mewahnya, ia tertidur di pojok ruangan. Kasur dikamar ini terlalu besar menurutnya. Tubuhnya tergulung selimut. Sepertinya dia tidur sangat pulas, sampai tidak menyadari ada pria yang duduk bersila dihadapannya. Menatapnya dalam diam. Jongin menggeliat, meregangkan tubuhnya. Mengucek matanya lalu membuka matanya perlahan. Dia mengerjap menatap pria di depannya. Itu pria yang tadi, batinnya. \"Siapa namamu?\" \"Jongin.\" \"Umur?\" \"20 tahun.\" \"Baiklah, aku hanya menanyakan itu. Sekarang mandilah, semua menunggumu di ruang makan bawah.\" Pria itu berdiri, tangannya sudah memegang knop pintu. \"Oh iya, Jongin.. Namaku Chanyeol.\" Lalu pria tadi -Chanyeol- meninggalkan kamarnya. Jongin tidak acuh, dia segera membereskan selimut dan bantalnya lalu mandi. Jongin sampai di ruang makan. Ada tiga pria disana, termasuk Chanyeol. Rambut Jongin masih sedikit basah, dia hanya memakan kaos tanpa lengan dan celana jeans panjang. Berbeda sekali dengan tiga pria yang kini tengah menatapnya, mereka memakai jas yang rapi. Apakah Jongin salah kostum? \"Kau menghalangi jalan!\" Sebuah suara mengagetkan Jongin, Jongin segera menyingkir. Seorang pria muncuk dibelakang Jongin, bibirnya mencebik kesal, tangannya terlipat di dada. \"Duduklah Jongin.\" Sebuah suara yang bernada perintah terdengar dari sekarang pria yang duduk di ujung meja. Jongin menurut, duduk disamping pria itu. Pria disamping Jongin mulai mengambil makanan, tidak acuh dengan tatapan Chanyeol yang mengintimidasi. \"Jongin, apa kau sudah mengenal kami semua?\" Chanyeol bertanya. Jongin menggeleng, \"Aku tidak ingin tahu siapa kalian.\" \"Kau tidak ingin tahu untuk apa kau ada disini?\" Tanya pria jangkung disebelah Chanyeol. \"Sebagai pelayan, kan.\" Jawab Jongin santai. Dia mulai makan perlahan. \"Setelah makan malam datanglah ke ruanganku.\" Pria disamping Jongin meninggalkan meja makan. Jongin mengangguk pelan. \"Aku Yixing.\" Pria yang tadi mencebik kesal memperkenalkan diri. \"Dia Yifan.\" Ucap Yixing sambil menunjuk pria jangkung disamping Chanyeol. Aura disini jadi lebih baik saat pria tadi pergi. Jongin mudah akrab dengan tiga orang ini. Saat makan malam selesai, mereka bahkan bermain monopoli bersama. \"Tuan Jongin..\" Jongin menoleh. Menatap maid yang tadi memanggilnya \"Tuan\". Apa itu ejekan? Jongin itu tawanan disini! \" Tuan Muda menunggu anda diruang kerjanya.\" Ucap maid itu. Ah, Jongin lupa. Dia harus menemui pria tadi kan. \"Dimana ruang kerjanya?\" \"Tepat didepan kamarmu.\" Chanyeol yang menjawab. Jongin mengangguk berterima kasih, lalu pergi ke lantai atas. \"Yak! Apa si brengsek itu sudah mengklaim Jongin?\" Yifan berteriak tidak terima. Dia kan tertarik pada Jongin. Eh. \"Jonginku akan terluka jika bersama Tuan Muda.\" Yixing menunduk sedih. Chanyeol mengusap punggung Yixing, \"Jika hyung sudah pulang dari perjalanan bisnis, minta hyung untuk memisahkan Jongin darinya. Agar Jongin tidak terluka.\" Jongin mengetuk ruang kerja \"Tuan Muda\" tapi tidak ada jawaban. Dia memberanikan diri masuk, si Tuan Muda tertidur dikursinya. Wajahnya mendongak, mata dinginnya terpejam. Jongin mendekat, mengamati wajah si Tuan Muda dari dekat. \"Aku ingin jadi setampan ini.\" Jongin merajuk pada dirinya sendiri. Dia ingin wajah sempurna seperti Tuan Muda. \"Yak!\" Jongin kaget, sebuah tangan melingkar dipinggangnya. Itu tangan Tuan Muda, tangan itu menarik Jongin untuk duduk dipangkuannya. Tangan Tuan Muda yang satu lagi menarik kepala Jongin agar Jongin menempel di dadanya. Jongin diam. \"Apa yang ayahmu katakan padamu?\" Jongin mendongak. Matanya mengerjap. \"Aku bertanya padamu, Jongin.\" Pria itu mempertegas pertanyaannya. Jongin diam. Melepaskan pelukan orang itu pada pinggangnya, tapi ia tidak turun dari pangkuan si Tuan Muda. Jongin berbalik membelakangi pria itu. Tangannya menggapai album foto di meja kerja. Membukanya satu persatu. Itu berisi foto dirinya. Apa Tuan Muda ini menguntitnya? Si Tuan Muda terbangun, memeluk pinggang Jongin lagi dengan posesif. \"Kau tidak mau menjawabku?\" Tanyanya lagi. Jongin menggeleng. Entah kenapa mulutnya memilih membisu sekarang. Air mata Jongin menetes. Ia melihat foto dirinya dengan kedua orang tua kandungnya. Darimana pria itu mendapatkan foto ini? Bahkan, Jongin sama sekali tidak memiliki foto serupa. Si Tuan Muda masih betah memeluk Jongin. Bahkan, ia kini menyenderkan kepalanya pada punggung Jongin yang bergetar karena menangis. \"Itu hadiah sambutanku untukmu. Kau tahu Jongin, sangat sulit untuk mendapatkan foto itu.\" \"Terima kasih.. Tuan.\" Jongin memeluk album foto itu dengan eratnya. Mereka terdiam. Sibuk dengan pikiran masing-masing. \"Oh Sehun!\" Mereka mendongak ke arah teriakan itu. Seorang pria berdiri di depan pintu.[Chapter 2] \"Oh Sehun!\" Mereka mendongak ke arah teriakan itu. Seorang pria berdiri di depan pintu. . . . . . Jongin terkesiap mendengar teriakan itu. Bahkan tubuhnya sempat sedikit bergetar tadi. Sehun tidak peduli dengan teriakan itu. Dia bergeming dengan posisinya tadi. Tangannya mengelus tangan Jongin pelan, berusaha menenangkan Jonginnya. Hah? Jonginnya? Sejak kapan Jongin jadi milikmu Oh Sehun!? \"Lepas pelukanmu atau kuseret Jongin ke belakang!\" Mendengar ancaman itu, Sehun segera melepaskan pelukannya. \"Apa maumu Kim Joonmyeon?\" Sehun bertanya dengan nada dinginnya. Dia terlihat muak sekarang. Joonmyeon hanya diam dan menatap tajam. Memberikan kode pada Sehun untuk menyuruh Jongin pergi dari sini. \"Jongin, bisakah kau keluar dulu?\" Dia menggunakan nada yang sedikit lembut pada Jongin, berbeda sekali dengan nadanya saat bicara dengan Joonmyeon tadi. \"Eung... Bolehkah aku membawa ini, Tuan?\" Jongin menunjukkan foto dirinya dengan keluarganya. \"Bawa album foto itu denganmu.\" \"Terimakasih, Tuan Muda.\" Jongin segera membungkuk pada Sehun lalu keluar dari ruang kerjanya. Di depan pintu, ia juga membungkuk pada Joonmyeon. \"Ada apa hyung ?\" \"Harusnya aku yang bertanya seperti itu. Ada apa Sehun?\" \"Ada oksigen.\" \"Aku serius.\" \"Aku juga.\" Joonmyeon terdiam. Sehun sepertinya benar-benar serius dengan jawabannya. \"Oksigen?\" \"Iya, oksigen. Itu adalah gas yang membuatmu tetap hidup. Alasan hidup seseorang adalah karena dia menghirup oksigen.\" Sehun menjelaskan. \"Oksigenmu...\" \"Jongin.\" \"Jangan lakukan ini lagi Sehun.\" \"Lakukan apa?\" \"Menodai para tahanan hutang disini.\" Wajah Sehun mengeras mendengar ucapan Joonmyeon. \"Hentikan itu Sehun.\" \"Sudah aku bilang bukan aku yang melakukannya.\" Sehun mengelak, untuk kesekian kalinya. \"Lalu siapa? Katakan padaku siapa yang melakukan itu!\" Joonmyeon berteriak marah pada Sehun. Sehun selalu mengelak, tapi dia tidak pernah mengatakan siapa orang yang melimpahkan kesalahan ini padanya. \"Percayalah, bukan aku orangnya.\" \"Sehun, para tahanan itu ada dibelakang. Dan setiap ada kasus, kau selalu terbukti sedang tidur diranjang tahanan itu.\" \"Aku hanya tidur. Bukan aku yang melakukan seks dengan mereka.\" \"Kalau begitu katakan pada kami siapa yang melakukan seks dan membuat mereka sampai trauma seperti itu.\" Chanyeol datang ke ruangan Sehun. Dia hanya ingin menjadi penengah disini. Terakhir kali Joonmyeon memarahi Sehun, mereka berakhir dengan katana dan pistol ditangan masing-masing. \"Tanyakan saja pada mereka.\" \"Jika saja mereka menggunakan mulut mereka dengan benar..\" Joonmyeon tersenyum kesal mengingat para tahanan yang bungkam saat ditanya. \"Tuan Kim! Keluar atau aku akan kebelakang!\" Yixing berteriak didepan ruang kerja Sehun. Jongin disampingnya hanya diam menatapnya. \"Masalah ini belum selesai Oh Sehun.\" Joonmyeon keluar diikuti dengan Chanyeol dibelakangnya. Yixing segera menarik tangan Joonmyeon untuk pergi dari sana. Dia harus membuat Joonmyeon tenang agar besok tidak ada perang saudara dirumah ini. \"Kau belum tidur Jongin?\" Chanyeol bertanya pada Jongin yang memeluk album fotonya. \"Aku belum mengantuk, Tuan...?\" \"Jangan seformal itu, panggil saja aku Chanyeol. Aku tidak termasuk dalam Tuan disini.\" \"Baik, Chanyeol.\" Chanyeol gemas dengan tingkah Jongin. Dia maklum dengan Sehun sekarang. Tidak heran jika si dingin itu jatuh cinta pada Jongin. Lelaki tan ini sangat manis. \"Boleh aku minta tolong sesuatu?\" \"Tentu saja, aku akan melakukan apapun itu.\" \"Matilah.\" \"Ne?\" Chanyeol menahan tawanya melihat respon Jongin. Si tan itu terkejut dengan ucapan Chanyeol. \"Aku becanda. Masuklah dan tenangkan Sehun, bisa?\" \"Memangnya Tuan Muda kenapa?\" \"Masuk saja dulu. Aku pergi ya, sampai bertemu besok Jongin.\" \"Pai pai Chanyeollie..\" Senyum cerah Jongin hilang saat Chanyeol pergi. Dia teringat harus masuk dan menenangkan Sehun. Bohong jika Jongin tidak tahu apa yang terjadi. Dia mendengar semuanya dari kamar. \"Tuan Muda..\" Tidak ada jawaban dari dalam. Jongin mengetuk pintu dengan sedikit keras. \"Pergilah jika kau tidak punya urusan penting.\" Sehun mengusir Jongin, bahkan sebelum mempersilakan Jongin memasuki ruangannya. \"Tapi tadi Chanyeol memintaku untuk...\" \"Pergilah.\" Jongin menurut pada Sehun. Dia masuk ke kamar, dan kembali ke pojokan dengan selimut dan bantal. Mungkin dia berencana tidur dipojokan lagi. Sehun sebenarnya tahu apa tujuan Jongin tadi. Dia mendengar semuanya dari dalam. Sebenarnya maksud Chanyeol dan Jongin baik, hanya saja Sehun malu bertemu Jongin sekarang. Wajahnya benar-benar terlihat kacau dengan air mata dan kantung mata yang sedikit membengkak. Jongin terbangun dari tidurnya karena merasakan tubuhnya digendong tadi. Sebuah tangan melingkar di perutnya. \"Tuan Muda?\" \"Diam dan tidurlah.\" \"Aku tidak bisa tidur disini.\" Jongin mengeluh. Dia tidak bisa tidur di kasur empuk dan luas ini. Aneh? Tidak kok. \"Kenapa memangnya?\" \"Aku tidak terbiasa Tuan. Aku biasanya tidur di kasur lantai.\" \"Kalau begitu biasakan.\" Sehun tidak peduli dengan gumaman kesa Jongin. Dia ingin istirahat dan melindungi Jongin saat ini. \"Tuan Muda..\" Sehun diam, dia lelah sekarang. Bahkan mengucapkan sepatah katapun rasanya sangat susah. \"Tadi Yixing bercerita kepadaku. Katanya semua tahanan hutang dijadikan pelayan dan tidurnya dibelakang. Bahkan saat kemari pun mereka hanya dijemput dengan mobil biasa.\" Sehun bergumam pelan mendengar cerita Jongin. Dia suka mendengar suara Jongin. \"Tapi kenapa aku tidak seperti itu Tuan? Aku dijemput dengan mobil mewah. Bahkan aku tidur di kamar Tuan. Dan aku tidak dijadikan pelayan.\" \"Bahkan Tuan memiliki foto-fotoku. Kenapa aku merasa... diistimewakan?\" Tidak mendengar jawaban dari Sehun, Jongin berbalik. Dia menghadap Sehun sekarang. \"Kupikir kau tertidur Tuan.\" \"Tidak, aku hanya suka mendengarkan suaramu.\" \"Suka sih suka. Tapi jawab pertanyaanku.\" Jongin mengerucutkan bibirnya. \"Itu karena kau memang istimewa Jongin.\" \"Istimewa kenap..\" \"Sudah pukul 3 pagi Jongin, tidurlah. Kau pasti lelah.\" Jongin menuruti ucapan Sehun. Dia akan kembali tidur. \"Selamat malam Tuan.\" \"Tuan..\" Jongin menggeliat dalam tidurnya. Dia dibangunkan oleh seorang maid dirumah itu. \"Eum?\" \"Anda segeralah bersiap, sarapan sudah siap. Sebentar lagi semua akan ada dimeja makan.\" Jongin segera beranjak dari tidurnya. Dia berjalan sedikit sempoyongan menuju kamar mandi. Dia harus cepat-cepat sekarang. Selesai membersihkan diri, Jongin segera turun ke lantai bawah. Dia memakai celana kain hitam dan atasan kemeja polos berwarna baby blue. \"Pagi Jongin. Duduklah, kita makan setelah semua berkumpul.\" Jongin disambut oleh pria yang tidak dia kenal. Pria itu berwajah cantik dan senyum yang manis. \"Kau disini Baekhyun?\" Yixing datang dengan pakaian formalnya, sepertinya dia akan pergi setelah ini. \"Iya hyung. Kata Chanyeol aku harus menjaga milik Sehun hari ini.\" \"Memang Tuan Muda kemana?\" Yixing dan Baekhyun diam memandang Jongin. Apa kata Jongin tadi? Tuan Muda? Itu bukan fetish si dingin Oh Sehun kan? \"Kenapa kalian berdiri saja? Duduk dan makanlah.\" Mendengar suara Joonmyeon yang suram, mereka segera duduk dan memulai sarapan. Tidak ada yang membuka suara, bahkan si cerewet Yixing dan Baekhyun pun bungkam saat mood Joonmyeon jelek seperti ini. \"Lay, hari ini kau ikut aku. Lalu kau Baek, jaga rumah. Dan kau Jongin..\" \"N-ne?\" \"Tetaplah di kamarmu, kunci pintunya dan jangan membuka pintu kecuali pada Baekhyun. Mengerti?\" Jongin mengangguk patuh, \"Iya Tuan Kim.\" \"Tidak usah memanggil Tuan, kau bukan pelayan disini.\" \"Hah? Tapi...\" \"Tanyakan pada Sehun apa posisimu disini. Dia yang bertanggung jawab tentang kau sekarang.\" Jongin hanya terdiam. Jika bukan pelayan, lalu apa posisinya? Babu? \"Kenapa harus Sehun? Aku juga ingin bertanggung jawab atas Jongin. Jongin bukan milik Sehun.\" Sebuah suara dingin yang disertai protes membuat semua yang diruang makan menoleh. Joonmyeon menoleh ke arah Jongin. \"Jongin, kau lebih ingin diurus dia atau Sehun?\" Jongin terdiam mendengar pertanyaan Joonmyeon. Kenapa dia harus memilih sih. Jadikan saja dia pelayan, itu lebih baik. Tidak rumit seperti ini. \"Jongin...\" Joonmyeon menginterupsi lamunan Jongin. \"Aku memilih...\" TBC Kok jadi gaje gini ya:\"[Chapter 3] \"Jongin, kau lebih ingin diurus dia atau Sehun?\" Jongin terdiam mendengar pertanyaan Joonmyeon. Kenapa dia harus memilih sih. Jadikan saja dia pelayan, itu lebih baik. Tidak rumit seperti ini. \"Jongin...\" Joonmyeon menginterupsi lamunan Jongin. \"Aku memilih...\" . . . . . \"Siapapun yang kau pilih, aku akan tetap mengklaimmu menjadi milikku.\" Sehun datang dengan wajah dinginnya. Dia bertelanjang dada, dengan perban yang membalut dadanya serta lengan kiri atasnya. \"Mana bisa begitu Sehun!\" Yifan -pria tadi- memprotes Sehun. \"Ya sudah, bisa kan saja.\" Sehun duduk di samping Jongin dan mulai makan makanan Jongin. Sepertinya dia terlalu malas untuk mengambil makan sendiri. Sesekali tangannya menyuapi Jongin yang hanya tertunduk diam. Saat bibir Jongin belepotan makanan, Sehun mengelapnya dengan ibu jarinya lalu menjilat ibu jarinya sendiri. Mengundang pandangan geli setengah jijik para penikmat sarapan diruang makan. Dan juga, mengundang senyum malu dari Jongin sendiri. Yifan sudah sedari tadi meninggalkan ruang makan karena muak melihat pemandangan itu. \"Kau habis dari mana Hun?\" Baekhyun bertanya, penasaran dengan perban yang membalut Sehun. \"Latihan.\" Sehun hanya menjawab singkat dan kembali pada kegiatannya tadi. Ditambah sekarang Jongin ikut menyuapi Sehun. Hei! Kemana perginya Jongin si pemuda yang sangat benci karena dikirim ke rumah ini!? Kemana Jongin yang sebelumnya!? Joonmyeon dan Yixing sudah asik dengan kegiatan membicarakan bulan madu. Ya, mereka akan menikah sebentar lagi. Baekhyun merasa menjadi obat nyamuk diantar dua pasangan ini. Kemana sih perginya si caplang itu!? Baekhyun mengabaikan makanannya, dia meraih ponselnya dan mengirim pesan pada si caplang itu. Kau dimana? Yeollie Di belakang. Kenapa sayang? Kau rindu? Tidak, kata Dilan rindu itu berat. Yeollie Hehe. Lalu kenapa kau mencariku? Cepat ke ruang makan. SEKARANG! Melihat pesan Baekhyun itu, Chanyeol segera meletakkan senapan laras panjangnya. Dia berlari secepat yang ia bisa. Terlambat sedikit saja, Baekki nya mungkin akan tega memotong kelaminnya. Sampai di ruang makan, Chanyeol tidak menemukan kekasihnya. Yang dia lihat hanya Joonmyeon dan Yixing yang sedang makan sambil membahas anak. Matilah kau Chanyeol... Baekhyun mungkin akan benar-benar memotong kelaminmu. \"Jongin, bisa tolong aku memakai kemeja ini?\" \"Iya Tuan.\" Jongin segera bangkit dari tidur telungkupnya. Dia memasangkan kemeja Sehun dengan telaten. Maklum saja, tangan Sehun masih terasa sakit jika memakai baju sendiri. \"Jongin..\" \"Iya Tuan?\" Jongin memasangkan kancing kemeja Sehun dengan sedikit kesal. Kancingnya itu cukup banyak, ditambah juga susah memasukkannya. \"Kau tidak ingin bertanya sesuatu?\" Jongin mengangguk, \"Aku punya banyak pertanyaan Tuan.\" \"Kalau begitu, bertanyalah padaku.\" Kali ini Jongin menggeleng tegas, \"Tuan sedang tidak sehat. Lain kali saja aku bertanya.\" \"Kau bisa bertanya apapun padaku kapanpun itu Jongin.\" Jongin terdiam. Ia berpikir sejenak. Sebenarnya dia tidak ingin bertanya dulu mengingat kondisi Sehun yang sedang sakit. Tapi karena Sehun terlihat memaksa maka... \"Aku ini siapa Tuan?\" Sehun mengernyit dengan pertanyaan Jongin. \"Kau Jongin, Kim Jongin.\" \"Bukan itu maksudku Tuan. Maksudku aku dikirim kesini untuk jaminan hutang keluargaku. Dan katanya aku akan dijadikan pelayan.\" \"Iya, lalu?\" \"Lalu kenapa aku tidak diperlakukan sebagaimana para pelayan yang lain?\" \"Ada aturan disini.\" \"Aturan seperti apa Tuan?\" \"Ada lima orang yang berkuasa disini.\" \"Lima? Siapa saja?\" \"Yang pertama, Kim Joonmyeon.\" \"Orang yang memarahi Tuan kemarin?\" Sehun mengangguk membenarkan. Iya, yang memarahinya adalah si Joonmyeon sialan itu. \"Yang kedua, Wu Yifan.\" \"Oh, aku kenal Yifan gege .\" Jongin bersorak senang. Berbeda dengan Sehun yang sedikit muram. \"Yang ketiga, Kim Jongdae.\" \"Aku belum pernah melihatnya.\" \"Dia masih dirumah kekasihnya. Jika kau bertemu pria dengan wajah dingin tapi bibirnya tersenyum. Itulah Jongdae.\" Ya, Jongdae itu istimewa. Tapi Sehun menjulukinya psikopat. Karena bibir Jongdae selalu terlihat tersenyum apapun keadannya. Hanya Sehun yang berani memanggilnya psikopat. \"Yang keempat, Park Chanyeol.\" \"Chanyeollie hyung ?\" Wajah Sehun mengeras mendengarnya. Sejak kapan Jongin nya menjadi sangat dekat dengan si caplang itu!? \"Tapi katanya kemarin dia bukan Tuan disini.\" \"Chanyeol memang seperti itu, tapi dia itu pemilik saham terbesar setelah Joonmyen.\" Jongin mengangguk mengerti. \"Yang terakhir, aku.\" \"Oh, pantas saja kau dipanggil Tuan Muda.\" \"Iya, dan kau nyonya mudanya.\" Jongin berusaha menyembunyikan rona merah dipipinya. Sepertinya kedua orang ini jatuh cinta. \"Lalu apa aturan yang Tuan maksud?\" \"Jika ada tawanan yang masuk rumah ini, kami diperbolehkan mengklaimnya jika kami tertarik padanya. Itu ada setiap kontrak kami, termasuk kontrak kami dengan ayahmu.\" \"Lalu aku..?\" \"Aku sudah mengklaimmu. Bahkan saat sebelum kau menjadi tawanan.\" \"Kapan itu?\" Sehun tidak menjawab pertanyaan Jongin, dia hanya mencium pipi Jongin dan keluar dari kamarnya. Dia ada urusan di luar hari ini. \"Kau sudah pulang, Tuan?\" Jongin terbangun dari tidur siangnya karena sebuah lengan memeluknya. \"Tuan Muda?\" Jongin membalikkan dirinya karena orang yang memeluknya itu tidak menjawab. \"Apa yang kau lakukan disini Tuan!?\" Jongin segera mendorong pria itu dari sisinya. \"Kemarilah Jongin.\" \"Tidak mau.\" Jongin masih setia berdiri di pojok ruangan favoritnya. Dia tidak mau diapa-apakan oleh pria ini. \"Aku tidak akan melakukan apapun. Hanya memelukmu.\" \"Tidak.\" Jongin menolak dengan tegas. Dia teringat obrolan singkatnya dengan Baekhyun tadi. Baekhyun bilang dia harus mengunci pintu, dan hanya boleh membukanya untuk Sehun, Chanyeol, dan Baekhyun. Tapi dia tadi ketiduran dan lupa mengunci pintu. Kata Baekhyun juga, dia tidak boleh percaya dengan omongan orang selain omongan Baekhyun dan Sehun. Kenapa tidak harus mempercayai Chanyeol? Itu karena Chanyeol bisa saja berbohong untuk menenangkan orang. Dan Baekhyun membenci sikap Chanyeol yang itu. \"Aku bilang kemarilah.\" \"Aku bilang tidak mau.\" \"Kemari atau akan aku bunuh Tuan Muda mu itu!\" Mendengar itu, Jongin goyah. Dia tidak ingin Tuan Muda terluka sedikitpun. Dia berjalan pelan mendekati pria itu. Pria itu menarik pinggang Jongin. Memaksa Jongin untuk duduk dipangkuannya. \"Kenapa kau bisa secantik ini Jongin?\" Pria itu bertanya sambil mengelus pipi Jongin. Jongin sendiri sedang berusaha keras untuk menahan tangisnya. \"Kau tahu, aku akan merebutmu dari Sehun.\" Jongin menggeleng. \"Kau lebih memilih Sehun daripada aku!?\" Pria itu membentak Jongin. Perlahan, Jongin mengeluarkan air matanya. Dia sedang merasakan tekanan batin sekarang. Sret. Pria itu merobek kemeja panjang yang dipakai Jongin. Ya, Jongin hanya memakai kemeja karena tadi dia memang berencana tidur siang. Sehun hanya bisa tidur jika dia telanjang, tapi Sehun melarangnya. Setidaknya Jongin harus memakai kemeja yang menutupi setengah paha jenjangnya. Jongin telanjang sekarang. Pria itu menatap jongin penuh napsu. Jongin hanya menangis dibawah kungkungan orang itu. Menggigit bibirnya menahan isaknya. Pria itu mencium leher Jongin dengan beringas. Giginya sesekali menggigit leher Jongin kemudian menyesapnya. Jongin hanya mampu menahan desahan sebisanya. Dia tidak ingin mendesah, itu akan membuat pria diatasnya semakin semangat menodainya. Pria itu terus mengerjai tubuh Jongin. Sekarang, pria itu sedang mengerjai penis Jongin. Jongin tidak bisa menahan desahannya lagi saat dia akan mencapai orgasme pertamanya. Dia meremas rambut pria itu ketika mencapai orgasmenya. \"Stop it.. Eunghh.. Akhhh.. Ge...\" Punggung Jongin membusur saat mengeluarkan cairannya. Bohong jika dia bilang tidak menikmati blowjob dari pria itu. Dia menikmatinya. Tapi hatinya membencinya. \"Sudah mendapatkan orgasme mu sayang?\" Jongin hanya diam dan menatap sayu pria diatasnya. \"Giliranku untuk mendapat orgasme ku.\" Dengan cepat pria itu membalik tubuh Jongin untuk menungging. Dia lalu menggesekkan penisnya dilubang Jongin setelah menurunkan sedikit celana kainnya. \"Jangan... Ku mohon...\" Jongin memohon dengan sangat pada pria itu. Tapi pria itu mengabaikannya. \"Jauhkan penismu dari Jonginku brengsek!\" TBC Ini saya nulis apa sih, kok gaje:\" Balasan Review jongiebottom iya, dilanjut kalo banyak yg suka.

Ku mohon...\" Jongin memohon dengan sangat pada pria itu. Tapi pria itu mengabaikannya. \"Jauhkan penismu dari Jonginku brengsek!\" . . . . . Bruk! Sehun memukul pria itu dari atas Jongin sampai pria itu terjatuh ke lantai. Sesegera mungkin dia menyelimuti badan Jongin. Jongin memeluk Sehun erat, seakan Sehun hendak meninggalkannya. \"Tuan... hiks.. hiks..\" Jongin menangis dalam pelukan Sehun. \"Aku ada disini sayang.\" Sehun mengelus rambut Jongin, menenangkan kesayangannya. \"Sialan kau Oh.\" Pria itu bangun dari jatuhnya lalu membenarkan celananya. \"Pergilah sebelum Baekhyun kemari.\" Sehun menyuruh orang itu pergi, seakan ingin menyelamatkan orang itu dari amukan Baekhyun. Baekhyun tidak mempunyai kekuasaan apapun di rumah ini. Tapi sama seperti Chanyeol, dia adalah orang kepercayaan disini. Dan dia bebas mau memarahi siapapun, termasuk si Tuan Besar Joonmyeon. Dia sudah masuk dalam keluarga mafia ini. Pria itu segera pergi setelah memberikan flying kiss pada Jongin. \"Kau tidak apa-apa?\" \"Sakit Tuan..\" \"Bagian mana yang sakit hm?\" Sehun melepaskan pelukan Jongin karena pria tan itu tidak segera menjawab. Dilihatnya pipi pria itu sedikit memerah malu dan bibirnya digigit gugup. \"Lubangmu?\" Jongin mendongak kaget. Bagaimana bisa Sehun mengucapkan kalimat vulgar itu dengan santainya. Jongin menolehkan kepalanya kesamping untuk menghindari tatapan Sehun, ia lalu mengangguk pelan. \"Tunggulah disini, aku akan memanggilkan Baekhyun dulu.\" Jongin menarik kemeja Sehun saat pria itu beranjak dari tempat tidur. \"Jika dia kesini lagi bagaimana?\" \"Tidak akan, aku janji.\" Jongin menggeleng. Dia tidak bisa percaya pada janji Sehun itu. Sehun menutup telinga Jongin dengan telapak tangannya. Ia mendekap Jongin di dadanya. Lalu, \"BAEKHYUUNN!\" Sehun berteriak sekeras yang ia bisa. Well, hanya itu satu-satunya cara agar dia bisa memanggil Baekhyun tanpa beranjak dari tempat. Tidak lama setelah itu Baekhyun datang dengan penampilan yang bisa dibilang... seksi. Ya, Baekhyun hanya memakai kemeja kebesaran sama seperti yang dipakai Jongin tadi. Ditambah bando pita yang dipakainya. Bukankah dia terlihat seperti baby boy ? \"Oleskan obat ini pada lubangnya.\" Baekhyun melemparkan salep pada Sehun. \"Jongin, katakan pada Joonmyeon apa yang barusan kau alami. Aku benar-benar muak dengan pria tiang itu.\" \"Pria tiang? Chanyeol?\" Sehun bertanya dengan sok polosnya. \"Tentu saja bukan. Tapi pria tiang yang barusan memasuki lubang Jongin.\" \"Kenapa bukan kau atau Chanyeol saja yang melaporkannya pada Joonmyeon?\" \"Ini karena janji sialan yang sudah kami buat denganmu brengsek!\" Baekhyun menutup pintu dengan keras. Hanya satu alasan ini yang membuat Baekhyun membenci Sehun. Sehun dan Jongin terdiam di kamar itu. Tidak ada yang mengeluarkan sepatah katapun. Hanya hembusan nafas keduanya yang terdengar. \"Hiks..\" Isakan lirih terdengar dari Jongin, Sehun dengan sigap mengelus punggungnya untuk menenangkan pria tan. \"Tuan..\" \"Apa Jongin?\" \"Dimana Tuan Kim?\" \"Joonmyeon? Dia sedang menyiapkan undangan, dia akan pulang sebelum jam makan malam.\" \"Aku ingin bicara dengannya.\" \"Kenapa sayang? Kau bisa bicara denganku.\" Jongin menggeleng, tangisnya semakin keras. Sehun memeluk Jongin erat, dia tahu alasan Jongin ingin menemui Joonmyeon. Tapi dia tidak mau itu sampai terjadi, bisa mati si tiang nanti jika Joonmyeon tahu masalah ini. \"Maaf Jongin, tapi bisakah untuk masalah ini kau tutup mulut?\" Jongin mengangkat wajahnya, menatap Sehun sendu. Matanya berbicara, dia minta penjelasan Sehun sekarang. \"Dia orang yang berarti untukku.\" \"Orang sebrengsek dia?\" Sehun mengangguk, \"Dia menyelamatkan orang yang paling berharga untukku.\" \"Siapa?\" \"Orang yang sangat aku cintai, kekasihku.\" Jongin melepas pelukannya pada Sehun. Hatinya mencelos mendengar Sehun memiliki kekasih. Kau itu kenapa Jongin? Memangnya apa hakmu untuk cemburu? Kau itu siapanya Sehun? Sadar Jongin, kau hanya pelayan disini. Jangan berharap lebih walau Sehun berkata kau itu miliknya. Kau hanya sementara saja disini. Jongin menidurkan dirinya. Dirinya membelakangi Sehun. Dia seperti kekasih yang sedang merajuk. . . . PRISONER . . . Sehun berjalan tanpa suara ke dapur. Dia melihat Chanyeol dan Baekhyun yang sedang memasak bersama. Kapan kita akan seperti ini lagi sayang? Batinnya sendu, dia merindukan kekasihnya. Sangat. \"Mau kopi?\" \"Luhan? Kapan kau datang?\" \"Espresso atau cappucino?\" \"Bukannya kau ada di China dengan Tao?\" \"Cappuccino. Pakai krim atau tidak?\" \"Ada alasan khusus kau kemari?\" \"Ini kopimu.\" Luhan menyerahkan kopinya pada Sehun. Ia lalu pergi menuju kamar Sehun. \"Luhan jelaskan dulu padaku..\" Sehun merengek seperti anak kecil. Sifat Sehun yang ini hanya ditunjukkan pada Luhan dan kekasihnya. Tepat didepan pintu, Luhan berhenti. \"Pertama, aku sudah di Korea sejak 5 bulan lalu. Kedua, aku dan Tao kemari berdua. Ketiga, aku datang karena Baekhyun bilang kekasihmu pulang dan si gila itu menyetubuhinya.\" \"Dia pulang?\" Sehun tertawa miris mendengarnya. Luhan membuka pintu kamar sedikit. Jongin tertidur dengan wajah damainya. Hati Luhan menghangat melihatnya. Malaikat kebahagiaan keluarga ini sudah datang. \"Aku akan menetap lama di Korea.\" \"Percuma, dia tidak akan ingat.\" \"Aku akan menghubungi yang lain agar segera datang.\" \"Luhan..\" Lagi. Sehun merengek lagi pada Luhan. Luhan itu seperti ibu bagi Sehun. \"Siapa yang belum tahu? Pasti Jongdae, Minseok, dan Kyungsoo ya?\" \" Hyung .\" Luhan terdiam. Jika Sehun sudah memanggilnya hyung dengan nada datar, artinya Sehun sedang kesal padanya. \"Percuma. Dia tidak ingat semuanya.\" Sehun meninggalkan Luhan, menuju ruang kerjanya. Dia menangis, Luhan tahu itu. Ini pertama kalinya Luhan menangis selain dihadapan Nini nya. \"Sehunnie..\" Luhan beranjak dari pintu kamar, mengikuti Sehun ke ruang kerjanya. Dia menahan lengan Sehun dan memeluknya, erat sekali. Baru kali ini Sehun menunjukkan kesedihannya pada Luhan. Tidak, mungkin ini kali pertama Sehun menunjukkan kerapuhannya pada orang selain Nini nya. Nini, kekasih Sehun. Alasan Sehun bertahan sampai sekarang. \"Kita ingatkan dia perlahan, ya?\" Luhan bicara dengan lembut, menenangkan adik kesayangannya. \"Tidak bisa. Ini sudah 5 tahun, dan dia tidak ingat sama sekali.\" Tangis Sehun semakin keras. Dia menyesal melepaskan Nininya dulu. Andai saja dia sendiri yang merawatnya, setidaknya Nininya akan mengenalnya sedikit kan? \"Dia pasti akan ingat, aku yakin.\" Luhan menangkup wajah Sehun, diusapnya liquid bening yang mengalir di pipi adiknya. Setelah itu, dia memeluk Sehun erat. Dulu Nini selalu melakukan ini jika Sehun emosi atau menangis, dan itu berhasil. Brak! Luhan reflek melepaskan pelukannya. Dia dan Sehun menatap pintu ruang kerja yang terbuka, dan pintu kamar yang baru saja dibanting oleh seseorang. \"Sifat cemburunya masih sama.\" Luhan tidak bisa menyembunyikan tawanya, Nini masih sangat cemburuan ternyata. \"Tadi dia marah.\" Sehun mengingat lagi sikap Jongin tadi. \"Padamu?\" \"Iya.\" \"Kenapa?\" \"Aku bilang aku punya kekasih.\" Mereka saling lirik dan tertawa cukup keras. Entah kenapa, tapi semua yang dilakukan Jongin memang nampak lucu dimata mereka. \"Kau ingat tidak Hun?\" \"Apa?\" \"Saat kau bilang kau memiliki kekasih lain, kau mengatakannya tepat saat ulang tahunnya.\" \"Aku ingat, dia berkata akan melemparkan pisau ke wajahku.\" \"Dan dia melakukannya, dia membawa banyak pisau.\" \"Iya, tapi dimarahi ibunya karena tidak ada pisau untuk memasak.\" Mengingat masa lalu itu membuat tawa mereka semakin meledak. Memang Nini tidak segalak dulu, tapi sifat merajuknya masih sama. \"Jadi itu kekasih Tuan Muda.\" Jongin bergumam dibalik pintu kamar. Ya, dia sedang mengintip ruang kerja Sehun sekarang. Sehun berbeda sekali sekarang. Saat bersamanya, Sehun tidak pernah tertawa sekeras itu. \"Jongin, kau mengintip?\" Teriakan Sehun membuat Jongin kelabakan. Dia segera berjalan ke tempat tidurnya dan berpura-pura tidur. \"Minta Bibi Im menyiapkan kamar untuk kalian.\" \"Disebelah kamarmu boleh?\" \"Jangan. Itu milik Niniku.\" Begitulah Sehun, mengklaim lantai 2 sebagai dunianya dan Nininya. Yang boleh tidur dikamar lantai 2 hanya dia dan Nininya. Sehun pergi ke kamarnya meninggalkan Luhan. Luhan mengambil foto keluarga di dompetnya. Ada Luhan dan Jongin remaja di dalam foto keluarga itu. Serta ada ayah dan ibu yang memeluk mereka penuh sayang. \"Ibu, aku berjanji akan menyusulmu setelah mengembalikan semua pada tempatnya.\" . . . . . .

New story. :D Nick Jones is absolutely GORGEOUS. I'm still working on my HHE story, and I've got a THIC story I'm working on... Haha, busy busy. (:. Disclaimer: I always forget these, so incase I forget on one in the future: I DO NOT OWN HILLS HAVE EYES. NOT NOW NOT EVER. Kay, thanks. Tomorrow was the day of the game. The game Blake had been excited about since LAST years game. So here we were, going to his precious game, the Winter of our Senior year, headed to Baton Rouge. Carly, Paige and I were sitting at a table in a diner on the outskirts of our little town, eating fries and looking through newspapers, trying to find Carly an apartment in New York before we left. \"Here's one in Tribeca for 3000.\" Paige pointed out. Carly look discouraged. \"That's still too much! All the money I have saved up won't even cover two months rent. I'm gonna have to work every second I'm not in class.\" \"Well, don't even think about not going!\" I said threateningly as I got up to go find Nick and Dalton. I passed Wade on my way outside. He grabbed my arm and stopped me. \"Hey, look, I know Nick's your boyfriend, and I know he treats you great, but do you think you could have him back off, just a little? I came on this trip to have fun, not put up with his crap.\" I sighed. \"I know, Wade. I'll talk to him, and I'll try to get him to behave, but I'm not making any promises.\" Wade grinned. \"Thanks cuz.\" He walked away and sat with Carly and Paige. I continued outside to find my boys. My names Isabel. Isabel Amelia Chapman. Dalton Chapman's twin sister. Well, fraternal twin. He's tall and dark, with naturally dark hair. I'm short, and pale, with naturally blonde hair. We've been best friends since the womb. In third grade Carly and Nick Jones moved in down the street from our house, and we all started hanging out. Paige was Carly's old friend from her old elementary school, so when they ended up going to the same Junior high together in seventh grade, she was added to our group. Nick and I got together the summer before eighth grade. Paige met Blake at a party in ninth grade. I introduced Carly and Wade at one of our family reunions, that the Jones twins went with me to. They had been together ever since. Dalton. Well, he had plenty of girls. I couldn't even begin to tell you their names. My brother was a player. He was also keeping something from me. So was Nick. I could tell by the way they were acting. Dalton was a good kid. A nice guy - He got into a lot of trouble, but only ever \"class clown\" trouble. Nick was a completely different story. He was an amazing boyfriend and a good friend. He was just still so young in some aspects. Nothing was his fault and everyone else is just bugging for no reason. He had a problem with the law. Two weeks ago, he stole a car and crashed it. For no apparent reason. Vandalism, shoplifting, underage drinking, possession, his list was quite long. But I love him. When I walked up to Nick and Dalton, they cut off their conversation and both glanced at me guiltily. I stopped dead in my tracks. \"Secrets don't make friends!\" I yelled, half joking half serious. \"Seriously, what's up with you guys lately? Do you need me to leave you two lovebirds alone so you can finish gossipin?\" \"No, Isabel, you're fine.\" Dalton answered a question without a witty comeback? Wow. Nick reached out and grabbed my waist, pulling me into his standing body. I brushed my lips against his. \"Guys, okay, what's going on?\" I asked. \"Nothing, babe. Really. Just talking.\" Nick whispered, kissing my forehead. \"Come inside with us.\" I suggested. Nick shrugged and followed me in. Dalton came after. There was a homeless man sitting out front of the restaurant with a cup in his hand. Nick kicked the cup out of his hand, laughing. \"Get a job, crow man!\" \"NICK!\" I threw his arm off of my waist and reached into my pocket. I had a $1 and a $5 that I gave to the man. He smiled huge, \"Aye, thanksa mizzes!\" \"No problem! And sorry about my...boyfriend.\" I shot a glare at Nick, who shrugged. He and Dalton teased me about giving my money to a stranger, and for being such a softy. But I noticed a soft look in both of their eyes. We sat at the table with Wade and Carly, who smiled at us. Her smile earned drool from Dalton, a smile from me, and a f*ck off look from Nick. \"Hey guys, gonna be a pretty sweet game tomorrow, huh?\" Wade attempted a conversation. Dalton mimicked him as Nick laughed and rudely said, \"Yeaaah.\" \"Nick.\" I shot him a look. \"Cool it.\" He glared at me, then turned his childishly moody face towards Carly. \"Hey.\" I caught his face in my hands and turned it towards me. He wrapped his arms around my waist as I kissed his lips softly then leaned in to whisper in his ear. \"Please, please, PLEASE, behave this weekend. Okay? For me?\" I pulled back and looked into his eyes, pleadingly. He smirked. \"I'll try.\" I grinned and kissed him again. \"I love you Is.\" \"I love you, Nick.\" I looked up and caught Wades eyes, who mouthed thank you and smiled. \"Dalton, please dont film me.\" Carly said, annoyed. \"What? It's alright, I'm not filming now.\" \"The red light's on!\" Nick pushed the camera down and spoke up, \"C'mon man, put the camera down. You know she doesn't like having people up in her face. She folds under pressure.\" Carly glared at him, \"You got something to say to me, Nick?\" \"No, no, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?\" Carly just nodded innocently. Nick snorted and grabbed his beer. \"You guys are lame! I'm out of here. See ya.\" Dalton exclaimed, stealing a fry. There was pretty much an awkward silence until Carly spoke up. \"Izzy, do you need anything for the trip? I don't know when we're stopping next, so maybe we should go stock up?\" \"Yeah, I definitely could use some caffeine. I can't survive off of beer alone. Unlike you, babe.\" I turned to smirk at Nick. He winked and took a swig. The four of us went off into the gas station and stocked up on soda's, energy drinks, and junk food. After paying, we went to find Blake, Paige and Dalton, and found them grouped around our cars. Nobody wanted to ride with Blake and Paige. The two were the horniest teenagers anyone had ever seen, and we were all sure they'd end up doing something nobody wanted to see before the end. Instead, we all chose to cram in Wades tiny car. Nick sat behind Wade, I sat in the middle, and Dalton was behind Carly. We. Were. Squashed. About six hours into the trip, I sat up from where I was laying with my head in Nicks lap and my feet in Dalton's. Wade was turning up the radio as the deejay announced: \"Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year as Louisiana and Florida...\" \"Ugh.\" He sighed. \"It's gonna be packed tomorrow.\" \"Dude, speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man!\" Dalton moaned. Nick, of course, had to be a jerk. He obviously wasn't trying very hard. \"Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.\" I sighed and shot him a glare that I'm sure he didn't see. He had his head leaned up against the window, looking out into the black. Carly looked back, and glared. Dalton snorted. \"More like a 'shot wheels' car, isn't it Wade? Wait, what'd you do, go to the barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut, or what?\" he laughed some more. I punched his arm. \"Dalton, stop.\" I hissed. \"Shut up, Dalton.\" Nick said. He laughed sarcastically along with Dalton, then punched him when he got annoying. \"OW! Dude.\" He laughed some more. \"You hurt me.\" Up ahead were some flashing orange lights. Great. Blake had decided to try and take a shortcut, but so far it just seemed like we were going out to the middle of nowhere. I squinted my eyes and leaned my face into Nick's shoulder to avoid being blinded. He threw his arm around me and pulled me in close. I had been pretty distant with him the whole ride, really pissed off that he couldn't seem to stop himself from making smartass remarks about everything Wade said. \"What the hell is this?\" Wade wondered. \"Oh, man.\" Dalton groaned. \"This sucks!\" I complained. \"So much for his nice little short cut.\" Carly said. \"I hope he's not gonna get us lost.\" Wade said doubtfully. He pulled the car up so we were driving beside Blake. I wasn't paying to much attention until Dalton started yelling and laughing, and punched me lightly. \"Damn! Yo, Yo! Wake up, Wake up!\" He laughed. \"What?\" I said aggravated. I was so tired and just wanted to sleep. Traveling does that to me. \"Oh. My. God.\" Carly said as everyone in the car busted out laughed. All we could see was Paige's blonde head bobbing up and down and Blake's facial expressions, looking like she was giving the best performance of her life. Comments were flying around. \"Oh my God! What are they doing! Look at that! Caught on tape! Is she flossing herself with that thing?\" Nick leaned forward and punched the horn. Paige jumped up REAL fast and Blake looked over with a \"Yeaahh, You know!\" look. Paige held up her phone and Carly answered hers. \"She 'dropped her lip balm'.\" She laughed. \"Dropped her lip balm, yeah right!\" \"So what's up?\" Carly asked her. We could see Blake and Paige talking. Looking like they were arguing. \"Why don't we just camp out? We're close enough, right?\" Blake honked twice then took off ahead of us. \"Hey, Wax museum.\" Wade pointed out a sign that was hanging, looking like it wouldn't last very much longer. \"You like that kinda stuff, Wade?\" Nick asked. I could already tell he was gonna come out with some smartass jerkoff remark. \"Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes.\" \"Well, I guess if you like things pretending to be other things... Which you obviously do. Right, sis?\" \"Nick. Stop. Damn. Can't you just cool it? Seriously. That happens to be my cousin, my best friends boyfriend, and your sisters boyfriend. Just BACK. OFF.\" I lost it. He shrugged, rolled his eyes and turned back to look outside. I smirked apologetically at Carly, who just smiled understandingly and patted my leg. I just don't understand why he can't just leave him alone. Yeah, I understand his past. Yeah, I know why he does all the crap that he does with the law, but seriously? Wade's never done anything to him. Ugh. We were following Blake still, and he had turned off onto some dirt back roads and was getting way off the main road. When we crossed over a bridge I started to get slightly concerned. \"Where are we going?\" \"He's probably just looking for some privacy.\" Dalton mumbled. We finally found a clearing that was really nice for camping. We all enthusiastically piled out of the car. Nick grabbed my hand to pull me out of the car, and when he got me out, he leaned me back against it and brought his face down to mine. \"Look, I'm sorry, okay?\" I could tell he wasn't really sorry, not for treating Wade like that, and that he still didn't like Wade, but I knew he was sorry for pissing me off. It's the thought that counts, right? \"Whatever, Nick. I'd just really appreciate it if you'd 'TRY' a little harder.\" I rolled my eyes, knowing that wasn't going to happen. \"Wade's not a bad guy.\" It was his turn to roll his eyes. Then he leaned down and kissed me. God, I could never get over his lips. The way he kisses. The way he holds my face to his when he's looking at me. I just hated that I was pretty much the only one that got to see this side of him. He acted like such a badass with an \"I don't care, f*ck you very much\" attitude. We pulled ourselves off the car and walked to where the others were looking at the site. I went to stand with Paige. \"Paige, Isabel, come with me.\" Carly asked. I looked at Paige, knowing what this was about. We both rolled our eyes then followed her over to where she was standing on the other side of the truck. \"Well?\" she asked. \"I couldn't. There's no point in freaking him out right now.\" \"As opposed to when you find out you are pregnant?\" Carly pushed. \"Is, back me up.\" \"Carls, she's not sure, okay? What if she causes a big fight and a whole bunch of drama over NOTHING? Remember what happened when...\" \"I still think you should have a conversation with him, Paige. At least warn him.\" She insisted. \"He's been looking forward to this stupid game for months. I don't wanna ruin it by starting a fight.\" Paige argued. \"Paige, he's not gonna marry you. His parents won't let him.\" Carly argued back. \"Who said she wants to get married?\" I exclaimed. \"Besides, you know Paige. She's been late before.\" \"When I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay?\" Paige reasoned. Carly shook her head, happy with this. \"Let's go.\" \"There are ticks out here!\" Paige exclaimed as she, Carly and I went to sit on a blanket where we had the music and a cd player. We were going through the cd's when I heard Dalton say, \"Yeah, don't help us or nothing.\" I looked up to see Nick, sitting in a lawn chair, beer in one hand cigarette in the other. Of course. \"Oh yeah!\" Blake grabbed a football and he, Wade and Dalton began a little passing game. \"Pass it! Pass it! You don't wanna... Ohh too slow! too slow!\" Blake threw the ball and it flew over everyone's head. \"TOUCHDOOOW...\" Wade yelled until he saw where it had landed. He held out his hand, expecting Nick to bend down and pick up the ball at his feet to return it. When Nick just sat there, he started walking slowly over towards him and the ball. Right as Wade got up beside it, Nick jumped up and threw the ball as hard as he could at Blake, hitting him right in the chest. \"Uh oh.\" I whispered to Carly, knowing there was going to be trouble. \"Nice arm.\" I heard Wade say. \"I see why they gave you a scholarship.\" \"Yeah, it's a real, tragedy, aint it?\" Nick held up his arm, subtly flipping Wade off. Carly and I both jumped up and ran over between them as Wade replied, \"Yeah, it is.\" \"Nick. You promised. STOP.\" \"Wade. Help Dalton, okay?\" Carly pleaded. \"Please.\" He turned to walk off and Nick mumbled, \"Bye Wade.\" \"Asshole.\" Carly rounded on Nick. He reached out to pull me to him, but I backed away. She was pissed. He needed to hear whatever she was going to say. \"You can be a prick to me, that's fine. But he didn't do anything to you.\" \"So you admit that you did something.\" It wasn't a question. \"I admit, according to you, that I did something, sure.\" \"You dimed me out.\" \"I did not dime you out! When the sheriffs asked where you got the car, I said I didn't know. I didn't even know it was STOLEN. And you're blaming that on ME?\" \"You could have covered for me, huh?\" Carly laughed, then sighed. \"You get caught stealing, it's my fault. You're resisting arrest, and it's the cops fault.\" \"Hahaha, No, he took a swing at me, ya know?\" \"Get kicked off the football team, it's the coaches fault,\" Carly continued. \"Mom and Dad kick you out of the house, it's their fault. You can't even keep a job for two weeks, it's every managers fault.\" \"What can I say, I'm surrounded by idiots.\" He shrugged. \"So then why did you come? To piss me off?\" Nick laughed again. \"Don't you get it? You're the good twin.\" He poked her lightly. \"I'm the evil one.\" He growled as he threw his beer to the ground and turned to walk off, but Carly wasn't done yet. \"Grow up! You are so afraid to take things seriously.\" \"Oh, yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving good ole Gainsville?\" He put on a fake hillbilly accent. \"New York City. Well, I hear they got buildings at tall as the sky!\" That one hurt her. Wade not being able to make up his mind about whether or not he was going to New York with her was really bothering her. That shot was below the belt. And he knew it. \"Okay.\" She nodded as she stalked off. He grimaced, knowing he took it too far. He reached out for me, but once again I backed up. \"Nick.\" I shook my head. Then I followed Carly back to where she was sitting with Paige again. \"Carls, I'm sorry. That was unnecessary, and he knows it. And don't worry about Wade. He'll realize what he needs to do before you leave.\" I smiled and hugged her. She shook her head into my hug. \"I just can't take it anymore. He finds the ways to piss me off.\" \"I know, Car. But when you two are livin it up in NYC, it won't even matter. He just has a lot of maturing to do. I'm gonna go talk to him.\" I stood and walked over to where he was sitting, of course, drinking a beer. I sat in his lap, and he looked away. \"Nick, look at me. NICK.\" He turned his head to me. \"I just can't take it anymore. No one can. Wade doesn't deserve this. Carly doesn't deserve this. I dont deserve this. It's like you're trying to make me pick between my cousin and my boyfriend. Nick, I love you. I love you with all my being. But I can't take this anymore. You need to grow up. Give me any reason to believe you will, cause I swear I'm done here if you can't.\" He knit his eyebrows together. \"Isabel, no. You can't break up with me. Not over this. I.. don't know what it is... I can't seem to control myself. Afterwards, I sit and wonder, 'Why the hell did I just do that?' but then I end up doing the exact same thing the next time. Is. I love you. And I WILL NOT lose you over this.\" He basically growled the entire thing. I sighed. \"Whatever, Nick. I don't feel like arguing about this right now. So cool it, okay? Cause I swear to you... The next time... I understand something's you can't help. Some remarks just slip out. But really? Just cool it.\" I looked him dead in the eye, and he understood my seriousness. He brought my lips to his. He pulled away, but just enough to press our foreheads together. \"I won't lose you. I love you.\" I began to smile, then the breeze blew. With it, came a horrible smell. Like dead decaying bodies. \"Woah! What's that smell?\" Blake asked. \"That's bad!\" Carly complained. I buried my nose into Nicks shoulder, but still couldn't escape it. \"Dalton, d'you crap your pants again?\" Nick yelled, laughing. \"Huh? Nah, Idunno, maybe. I mean, I'm wearing my work clothes, so...\" He trailed off laughing as he pretended to smell every part of his body. Wade had gotten a flashlight and was shining it in the trees where the smell seemed to be coming from. \"Something's dead out there.\" He said. \"No, somethin's dead right HERE. And we need to drink it back to life! Bless me dawg.\" He held out his hand as Nick threw him a beer. Music, beer, and people laughing were everywhere. Everyone had gotten a little buzzed. Not enough to be drunk, just enough to have a little fun. Dalton was running around with his video camera, annoying people, of course. Everyone calmed down after about thirty minutes. Carly was playing with the fire, while Blake sat in a chair, with Paige leaned up against his legs. \"You guys gonna do it tonight?\" Dalton asked. \"Screw off.\" Paige replied. \"Come on, you know you want it.\" he laughed. Blake shook up his beer can and opened it onto Daltons camera. That caused him to freak out. \"What? Come on, man. You don't gotta spray it at me, dude.\" he complained. \"He keeps messing around!\" Blake said. Dalton went and stood by the fire, filming Carly. \"Dalton, what'd I say?\" \"All right, my bad, my bad. Sorry.\" He closed the camera and put it down. But Carly stood up and started going after it. \"What? No, it's off...\" \"You're killing me with this thing!\" She said as she took off after him. \"Give me that... Oh, and the tables turn!\" \"No, no, no. Come on. Don't...\" I laughed. I knew my brother. He filmed other people because he hated being filmed himself. \"Look how cute you look on camera, though! You look good.\" Carly cooed. \"I think we might have to do a little makeover.\" Paige said, holding a blanket up to him. \"What do you think? He looks like smurf.\" She laughed. Then her and Carly pushed him into the tent for his 'MakeOver.' Blake came and sat on the cooler beside where I was sitting in Nicks lap, my legs thrown across the arms of the chair, while he ran a lighter up and down a beer bottle. They had a little talk going on, but I wasn't really paying attention. I was too focused on how pretty the stars were. Then I heard Blake ask, \"So why'd you steal that car anyway? I mean, you didn't need to do that. Get that rush, huh?\" Nick was silent for a few seconds. \"Something like that.\" Suddenly, a lot of commotion came from over in the tent. \"You're coming out!\" Carly ordered, stepping out. \"I don't know...\" we faintly heard Dalton mumble. \"Yes! If you don't I will be so mad!\" Then he came flying out of the tent. \"Damn, Paige!\" \"look how good you look!\" Carly exclaimed. He was wearing a bright yellow collared-fleece pull over and Rhine-stone sparkled sunglasses with his work pants on bottom. Very classy. \"Heeey.\" He laughed. \"He looks light Elton John, but more gay.\" Blake laughed. He left to stand with the group. I laughed again, then leaned up against Nick. He might be an immature jerk at times, but he was so warm. and Strong. and he always smelt so good. I felt so safe in his arms. \"Elton John is gay?\" Dalton faked being surprised. Blake pulled Paige into his chair, kissing her. Carly went and sat in Wades lap, kissing him. Dalton grabbed his camera and began filming it, whispering things like, \"Oh yeah, that's hot. Gimme somma that action.\" Nick pulled me close and kissed my forehead. Of course, he would be tame at a time like this. The mood was in the air. There was something about being out here, on a night like that that made me want him. So bad. I returned the kiss on his lips. He smiled as he ran his tongue across my lips. I ran my tongue out to meet his, and our regular dominance battle ensued. Of course, he won, and was completely in control of the kiss. We broke off when I felt something begin to grow under my legs. He had been so careful ever since we had almost gotten pregnant. I understood where Paige might be scared of telling Blake. Nick hadn't taken it very well when I told him I might possibly be. He started freaking out and apologizing, and wouldn't even touch me for about two weeks. I sighed and leaned my head into his neck, knowing that was as far as I was getting at that moment. Dalton walked over to us, still filming. \"Don't even think about it, dude. I ain't kissin' you.\" Nick joked. \"C'mon, you know you want to, dude! Haha! Just kidding. Psyche! I wouldn't kiss your ass for shit!\" Dalton returned. I thought that was a very sincere way to put this, seeing as wading through shit was his living... That caused me to laugh even harder. Then two blinding lights pulled up. Dalton shut his camera and put up his hand to block the light. I stood up beside him. The truck just sat there. Staring at us. \"Yeah?\" Wade shouted. \"Hey, yo, man, you need something?\" Blake asked. \"What does he want?\" Carly asked, sounded as freaked out as I was feeling. \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade requested. \"Okay, this is getting kind of creepy.\" Paige stated. \"Hey, come on, man, get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.\" Blake urged. Wade and Carly stood up with Dalton and I. \"Can we help you?\" Wade asked. \"Maybe we're on his property?\" Carly suggested. \"No, we didn't even pass a gate.\" \"God, why doesn't he just go away?\" I complained. I'd never liked being watched like that. Not that I've ever had that particular situation happen... \"Hey, man, turn your lights off.\" Blake warned, him and Paige also standing up. \"Hello?\" Wade yelled. \"Turn your light's off or i'm whuppin someone's ass!\" Blake was starting to get angry. Wade held out his arm to stop him from going any farther. \"Woah, it's cool man.\" I looked down at Nick, knowing he wasn't just going to sit there and take this. I'd known him too long. He was going to do something drastic and stupid. He stood up and chucked his bottle at the truck, hitting the head light. Oh yeah. Drastic. Stupid. Do I know my boyfriend, or what? \"NICK!\" Carly screeched at him. He stood up and walked forward to the front of the group, throwing his hood off. He glared at the truck. Dalton popped out behind him and threw his hands in the air. \"Oh...Lord.\" I whispered. \"WHAT?\" I'm sure the creepy person in the creepy truck creepily staring at us was about to bust a gut. If I hadn't been so freaked out, I would have. Elton John acting all tough? HA. The truck finally reversed and drove away. Nick turned back and grabbed me into his side. I wrapped my arm around his waist and Blake and Dalton told him how great and hardcore he was. \"Don't encourage him!\" I told them. \"What the hell was that about?\" Carly asked, grabbing his arm. \"He's gone, ain't he?\" He pulled away and we went to sit down again. This time, we pulled our chairs and the cooler closer to the group, and the fire. Mmm. Sleeeep. I say that But I'll prolly end up writing at least some of the next chapter. Idunno.[Chapter 2] Thanks for the reviews C:. Make's me feel like I'm not just wasting my time. And A Certain reviewer asked for a twist; not following the movie to a tee. And I Promise one or two are definately coming! I didn't work them into this chapter,... But there are some coming! Disclaimer: I DO NOT OWN THE HOUSE OF WAX! I woke with a start later that night. Something was standing at the door of the tent Dalton Nick and I were sharing! I saw the red light of a video camera, so I figured it was Dalton, but when I looked at where he had been laying on to the left of me, I saw his sleeping body still there. So that meant... Who was outside? I gasped, and the figure quickly backed away. \"Nick! Dalton!\" I quickly shook them awake. \"Guys! Wake up! Now!\" They both sat up, and looked at me, slightly pissed off. \"What?\" they both grumbled. \"Guys, there's something outside! I saw it! Outside of our door. With Daltons video camera!\" \"You were sleeping.\" Nick mumbled. \"Go back to bed.\" \"No, Nick. I was wide awake.\" Dalton groaned and laid back down in his sleeping bag. \"You deal with her, man.\" He mumbled. I rolled my eyes, upset they wouldn't believe me. \"Nick, I wasn't sleeping.\" \"Is, it's late. You had a few beers before bed. We're fine. There's no one out there. Come here.\" He held out his arms for me, and I fell into them, laying back. He was asleep in seconds, but I was wide awake now. I laid there, his arms around me, feeling safe yet curious. I couldn't take it anymore. I got up carefully and unzipped the tent. Over in hers and Wades tent, Carly was just stepping out. \"Did you see it too?\" I whispered. \"No, but I heard something. What did you see?\" She asked nervously. \"A person. It had the body of a man, but hair long enough to be a girls. Standing outside of the door of our tent. Nick and Dalton don't believe me. They say I'm just sleeping.\" \"Wade told me it was probably just a serial killer or something and went back to sleep. I know I heard something.\" By now we were standing together beside the fire, looking around. I heard rustling by Wades car, and apparently she did too, cause her head whipped over there as fast as mine did. We slowly began walking over there. I walked around one way and she walked around the other. I didn't see anything, so I backed away. We looked at each other for a minute. \"Maybe I WAS just sleeping?\" I suggested, not really believing it. \"Yeah, maybe I just heard an animal.\" She said, and I could tell by the look on her face she didn't believe either of us. We both turned to go back to bed, but there was something there. She gasped and I screamed, loud. But it was just Wade. Commotion came from Blake and Paiges tent, as well as mine. \"What? Who's that? What happened?\" Was yelled as our friends piled out of their tents, still sleeping. \"IS! Chill!\" Wade mumbled. \"What're you guys doing?\" \"What's goin on?\" Blake asked. I took a second to get my breath. \"Sorry, guys. Carly and I both just heard and saw something, so we were out here looking around. But it was nothing. Everything's okay. We just didn't expect to see Wade standing there behind us. I guess I'm just a little freaked out. Sorry guys.\" Nick and Dalton walked over to were Carly and I were standing. Nick wrapped his arms around my waist from behind and Dalton stood in front. Paige and Blake went back to their tent. \"Wade, what were you doing you out here?\" Carly asked. \"Getting you back to bed. It's four in the morning.\" He grabbed her arm and pulled her back to the tent. She looked back and caught my eyes, and I could tell she was still just as worried as I was. \"Damn, Izzy. Are you okay?\" Dalton asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I guess I was probably just dreaming. It just seemed so real.\" \"You're shaking.\" Nick pointed out. \"Well, Nick. I just had the crap scared out of me. Plus it's freezing out here. Yeah, I'm shaking just a bit. I'll be okay, guys.\" I pulled my boys back to our tent. We climbed in and I climbed back in Nick's sleeping bag with him. The rest of the night was pretty uneventful, and somehow I fell asleep. \"GUYS! Wake up! It's 2:30!\" Blake was yelling. \"Let's go guys. Get up. Get up! Wade! Dalton, let's go! We're gonnna miss the damn game.\" I heard him running around, but couldn't get myself up quite yet. \"NICK!\" something hit our tent. \"Get UP!\" We all filed out of our tents as Blake, who had already thrown on clothes, was throwing stuff in the back of his truck. We grabbed some clothes out of our luggage that we had kept in the back of Wades car. After changing, Carly Paige and I went to the woods to relive ourselves. \"So, you and Wade talk some more?\" Paige asked. \"We're just in different places right now. He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying.\" \"Oh, my God, there's that smell again!\" I commented. \"I think it's coming from over there!\" Carly said as she began walking towards it. \"Oh, yeah, lets follow the nasty smell!\" Paige said sarcastically. \"I wanna see what it is!\" \"Why?\" Paige and I both groaned, looking at each other. \"Oh, come on.\" She laughed. We trekked through the woods, nearly killing ourselves on stuck out tree branches. \"I cannot believe you're making me do this.\" Paige complained. \"Come on, it'll be fine.\" \"I'm gonna throw up.\" Paige groaned. \"Only YOU.\" I spat at my crazy best friend. \"Oh, my God. I HATE you.\" Paige and I moaned at the same time. She turned around and laughed at us, but when she did, she fell. \"CARLY?\" We ran screaming to where she had disappeared. There was a huge cliff, and at the bottom she was stuck, hands in a pit of bloody decaying animals, legs thrown up the hill. \"Carls!\" Paige stood shocked as I started yelling for the guys. \"GUYS! HELP US! GUYS!\" Paige started yelling, along with Carly. \"GUYS, WE'RE IN HERE!\" Then I noticed that Carlys screams got more urgent. I started trying to make my way down to her, when the guys came bounding down the hill. Wade immediately slid down to here and pulled her out. Nick and Dalton slid down to me. Nick pulled me in, \"Yep, that smells about right. Are you okay?\" \"I'm not the one that was stuck head first in a roadkill pit, thanks. I'm fine.\" I smiled up at him, then returned my gaze to Carly. She was slowly making her way up the hill. \"Carl?...\" \"I'm fine... Just disgusted.\" Just then a truck pulled up. \"Hey is that the truck from last night?\" Blake asked. \"No, not unless he got his head light fixed...\" The truck backed into the pit and a short dirty man got out. He went to the back and begin pulling dead animals out and throwing them in the pit, acting like he didn't even see us. \"Hey!\" Wade called. \"Don't you see that?\" Carly pointed to a hand sticking out of the pit. Oh. Oh, Lord. \"What is that?\" The man looked up, looked at the hand and walked to it. Then he started to pull it up. Oh, LORD. Oh, God. Disgusting. \"No way.\" Wade whispered. \"What are you doing, man?\" Nick pulled me in closer, Dalton stepped in front of me, and Carly backed up to where we were. The man had a firm grasp on the hand, and was pulling. I shouldn't look. I shouldn't look. I SHOULDN'T look. But I couldn't look away. The hand popped off. \"Anyone need a hand?\" The guy laughed. It was plastic. What the crap. \"I'm just foolin. It's not real, you see?\" He knocked on it to show its fakeness. \"God.\" Carly sighed and walked over to where Blake and Paige were standing. \"I found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago.\" The guy continued. \"What are you guys doing here?\" \"We were all, uh, camping up through those trees.\" Wade told him, and I personally was glad he was taking charge and talking for the group. This guy freaked me out. Paige found Carly some water, and they began cleaning her off. My wonderfully tactful brother actually asked the blood and guts covered Carly if she had seen his camera anywhere. The looks on their faces were enough to make him back off. His camera was gone? That's strange. The... thing... I saw last night had a video camera... \"Hey, you dunno if there's a gas station around here, do you?\" Wade asked. \"Well, I got some gas in the truck if-\" \"I need a fan belt.\" \"What?\" Carly and I both asked. \"Just busted.\" He replied. \"Perfect.\" She muttered. I looked at Nick. \"Babe. Please. Please. Please. Swear to me you had nothing to do with this?\" \"Is, I swear. I didn't touch the damn fanbelt.\" He smiled. I believed him. I couldn't not believe that smile. \"Bo might have one. Runs a station in Ambrose.\" The dirty roadkill pit guy told us. \"Bout, fifteen miles up the road.\" \"Let's just get one in Baton Rouge.\" Blake suggested, anxious about missing the game. \"We'll put it on when we get back.\" \"Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car.\" Wade shot him down. \"What if that guy from last night comes and strips it?\" \"Well, whatever, man. You're gonna miss the game, then.\" \"Yeah,\" He looked at Carly. \"Well, that's not why I came.\" \"All right, look. I'll run you up to the station.\" I knew he couldn't just leave him here. Blake might love the game, but he's not a bad friend. \"But let's go now. Kickoff's in a couple of hours.\" \"Dude, You're already late. You still gotta find a scalper and snag tickets.\" Wade argued. \"Yall should just go now. I'll stay with my car... It's fine. Just pick me up a fan belt on the way back. Make sure it's a 15-inch.\" Blake shook his head, \"Okay.\" \"I'll give you a ride.\" The guy spoke up. \"You serious?\" \"If you like.\" The man shrugged. \"Well, yeah. Yeah.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, if it's cool.\" \"I'm going with you.\" Carly spoke up. \"Carly, no.\" Paige argued. \"Yes. It'll be fine.\" She walked by me and I grabbed her where there was no dirty on her. \"Carl, you sure? You want me to stay behind too? Are you sure you're okay?\" She smiled, \"I'm fine, Isabel. You go with Nick and them. Have fun. I'm fine.\" I kissed her on the cheek and let her go. \"All right, let's go.\" Blake turned and walked off, Paige in tow. \"Carly.\" I heard Nick call. \"What?\" He ripped off his tank top and handed it to her. \"Thank-Thank you.\" God, he was beautiful. His arms, his shoulders, his stomach. The tattoos that I had hated at the time. His muscles. His back. I couldn't believe that he was mine. I couldn't believe that he was anyones. A person like that deserves to be up in the Heavens, perched on the highest of thrones. He was perfect. I snapped back into my right mind and he stood off to the side to block Carly from the creepy man. I walked up and stood in front of her, while Dalton took the other side and Wade joined me in front of her. Judging by the laugh and smile on Creepers face, I'd say we didn't do a very good job of blocking her from view. \"Come on, baby. Let's get out of here.\" Wade said. \"Be careful, guys. I love you both.\" I was slightly nervous about letting them leave. I didn't want them going off with a creepy stranger in a creepy place. \"We love you, too. We'll call you guys later.\" They made their way down to the truck and got in. As it drove off, Dalton spoke up, \"You just gonna let em leave like that, man? With a guy who throws roadkill in a pit for a living?\" Nick laughed and pulled me to his side, \"You clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic-Tank-Man. What's the difference?\" He began pulling me up the hill. \"Well, I don't walk through it, that's one.\" Dalton pointed out. \"That's a difference, right?\" \"Haha, Yep.\" I stumbled on a rock, and Nick sighed. I was, still am, very clumsy. It will be my downfall someday. He turned around and pulled me onto his back. I could feel his muscles move and he walked and moved and laughed at Dalton trying to come up with more excuses. \"What I clean wasn't once a living, breathing being. Even if it did come from one.\" He spat. \"Ding ding ding! We have a winner! You are officially less creepy than the strange man that throws roadkill in a pit! I'm so proud to call you my brother.\" I laughed. We finally made it back to camp to see Blake running around, shoving everything in the back of the cars and Paige, sitting on a stump. I went by her. \"It doesn't feel right, ya know?\" I started. \"Leaving them? I know. It's driving me crazy. I'm worried sick about them.\" She sighed. \"I'm gonna talk to Blake. Tonight. After the game. I figured we'll probably end up camping out again, so then. I think I'd rather have people around when I tell him.\" She looked at the scar on my right wrist as she said this. \"Paige. You don't have to be afraid of Blake. I'm not trying to talk you out of telling him, I'm just saying... When Nick threw that broken bottle at me, he didn't know I was standing there. Or that I would try and catch it. It's not Nicks fault that I have this scar. And Blake would never do anything like that. Paige, don't be afraid of him. And even if, by some chance, he does decide that he wants to split... You've still got the rest of us. It's not like we're just going to abandon you. We love you, Paige.\" She smiled. \"I know you're right. I just... I'm so scared. Everything's going so good right now. Our three year is coming up and everything... I don't wanna ruin that by dropping the daddy news...\" \"GUYS. Are you purposely trying to make me miss this game?\" Blake complained. \"Get in the car! NOW!\" We sighed and stood up. I climbed in the back seat between my boys, as usual. Paige was in the passenger seat. It took us less time to get back to the main road that it had taken us to get out here last night. Blake was flying, so nervous about missing that game. I settled in for the hour and a half or so we had left until we got to the stadium. Three hours later, we were still 50 miles away from the stadium, on an overpass backed up for as far as i could see. Nick was leaning out the window, one hand on my thigh, and I was leaned back into Daltons arms. He had his head thrown back. This sucked. We had MAYBE moved a mile in the past 30 minutes. Seriously? I couldn't take this too much longer. \"Dude, it's over.\" Nick mumbled. \"It'll move!\" Blake was pissed, but still hopeful. Desperately clinging on to that last glimmer of hope of catching this game. \"It's not moving!\" Paige informed him. \"We'll make the second half!\" His grip on that glimmer was slipping. \"Okay, well I'm not sitting in this traffic.\" I told him. \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" \"We have to go back!\" \"Turn around!\" \"I'm not missing the best game of the year!\" His grip was almost gone. \"Turn. The car. Around. Okay?\" \"They're waiting for us already.\" Blake threw his head on the horn. \"Fine. We're turning around.\" He manuevered himself into the off ramp, which was surprisingly unblocked and turned us around. I sat back, but this time I leaned into Nicks arms. \"Great. Now we get to deal with the drama queen all night.\" I whispered. He laughed and kissed my forehead. Mmm. I couldn't help it. His lips just... they did something to me... even after five years, I still get those feelings in my stomach. I quickly kissed his lips, and he ran his tongue over mine. I pulled away, as hard as it was. There was a time and a place for everything. We leaned back and were sleeping in no time flat. We got back to the campsite in a surprisingly short time. Then again, there wasn't 500 miles of traffic backing us up. Nick and Dalton were peeing on a tree while Paige and I looked through cd's. Blake walked over to talk to them, then they turned back to us. \"Nick and Dalton are gonna go get em.\" \"Why? We can go.\" \"Oh, baby. Come on. I'm tired of driving.\" Blake whined. \"In other words, he wants to get some.\" I whispered to her, smirking. She giggled and stuck her tongue out at me. \"Okay.\" She yelled. I stood, prefering not to stick around and see what was going to go down. Trust me, every one of us had already seen and heard more than enough from these two. I went and stood by Nick. He started to hand him the keys, then jerked back. \"Why don't you let my man drive?\" He threw the keys to Dalton, who pointed and laughed at Nick. \"Ahah! You heard him. Move!\" Nick grabbed his jacket. \"Give me the damn keys.\" \"Okay, very slowly. Thank you.\" He held up his hands in defeat and handed over the keys. Nick climbed in the drivers seat and Dalton in the passengers seat. I opened the back door... and decided I didn't want to be back there by myself. I closed it, opened Daltons door, and climbed in his lap instead. I positioned myself where I was pointing towards Nick with my back against the door. \"Just like old times.\" Dalton laughed. I smiled at him, then Nick, who leaned over and brushed his lips against mine. We pulled out of the campsite and I began messing with the GPS. \"Just let me drive, b*tch! He gave me the keys!\" Dalton complained. Nick threw his arm over Daltons chest to stop him. \"Yeah, cause he thinks I'm the one who stole the car.\" He took his hand up to tap Daltons chin. \"And crashed it.\" \"...what?\" I looked back and forth between Nick and Dalton. \"Dalton? YOU stole the car?\" I looked at him for confirmation, and he shrugged in a \"Yeah,-sorry-we-lied-to-you-and-made-you-think-your-boyfriend-stole-the-car-but-he-was-really-just-covering-my-ass\" kind of way. My mouth fell open. \"Nick. Oh my God. I'm so sorry.\" I dropped my head into my hands. \"All those times we fought and I yelled and you just sat silent... I thought you were just being stubborn... Babe. I'm so sorry. I...\" He grabbed my hand comfortingly. \"Hey. Look, I chose to do it. I knew there was going to be Hell to pay.\" \"C'mon man, You know you didn't have to do it.\" \"Look, you're jackets clean. Mine's already got plenty of stains on it. One more ain't gonna hurt. You found this town yet, babe?\" \"They guy said Ambrosia?\" I asked. \"No, Is. Ambrosia is that thing Auntie Jen makes for Thanksgiving. Ambrose is the town.\" Dalton laughed. \"Right... Well... Ambrosia... Ambrose... Neither are on here.\" \"That's weird.\" Dalton mumbled. Nick's eyebrows knitted together. \"Then where the hell is this town?\" \"Idunno, he said about fifteen miles... Just keep driving straight I guess...\" He still had hold of my hand, and I wrapped my other hand around his. I leaned against Dalton. I felt so bad. I... yelled at him. So many times. When all this time he was just covering for my dumbass brother. \"Why the hell didn't yall tell me?\" I burst out. \"Is, we didn't tell ANYONE. You're the only person besides us that knows.\" Dalton tried to explain. \"I'm your SISTER, Dalton. Not even just your sister. Your TWIN. And You're GIRLFRIEND, Nick. All those fights... You couldn't just tell ME? Not that I expect special treatment just cause I'm your sister and your girlfriend, but i mean, come ON! It's not like I was going to run to the police and tell them anything!\" \"Is, we just thought it best that no one know. I'm sorry we lied to you. I love you.\" Nick smiled that smile at me. I could only faintly see it in the glow from the GPS. \"Yeah Izzy Cee,\" Dalton tried to butter me up by using my childhood nickname. \"I'm sorry too.\" He pulled me into as much of a hug as we could in our current position. \"Ugh. I love you guys too...\" I fell into silence and just stared out the window, not looking at anything in particular. After a few minutes of silence, Dalton spoke up, \"So, uhm, You think, uh, Carly and Wade are gonna stay together when she moves to New York? Cause she be lookin at me sometimes like...\" \"Dalton, it ain't happenin.\" Nick cut him off. \"What? What do you mean?\" \"And even if it was happenin,\" Nick continued, \"... It ain't happenin. Nothing personal.\" \"Why? You like me better than Wade, right?\" Nick shrugged, \"Wade's not so bad.\" He smiled and I squeezed his hand. Dalton thought for a second, \"Yeah, I like Wade too.\" He broke off again. Whether he was thinking of a comeback or he had just given up on the matter I couldn't tell. But I did get to wondering... Why was NICk good enough for Daltons sister, but DALTON not good enough for Nick's sister? I mean, seriously? Should I be offended that my boyfriend is saying that my brother isn't good enough for his sister? I just brushed it off. I'm always assuming the worst. He's probably just refering to the fact that he likes Wade and his sister being together... We finally arrived at the end of the trail where it was all washed out. Nick got out, so Dalton and I followed. \"Is this is?\" Dalton asked. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, should we drive through it, you think?\" Nick looked at him like he couldn't believe he'd even suggest that. \"Through ALL that?\" \"Idunno, I could do it.\" He didn't sound too sure of himself. Nick and I both laughed, but Nick handed him the keys and walked over to me, where he began zipping up his jacket. Dalton walked to the drivers side of the truck, then looked down at how low to the ground the truck was compared to all the mush that \"He could drive through.\" \"That's what I thought.\" Nick laughed as he grabbed my hand and pulled me forward. Dalton locked the car as he crossed the water with us. We walked into the town... and didn't see a single person. \"Yeah, cause this isn't creepy at all...\" I mumbled, not expecting anyone to hear me. Nick did, though, and he pulled me closer. We walked up to the gas station. \"Hello? Carly, Wade? Hello?\" Dalton yelled as he poked his head through the door. \"Man, there's music playing, but I don't think anyone's here.\" There was, infact, very loud music playing. Even if someone was here they probably wouldn't hear our yells over that noise. \"No one's here.\" Nick stated. He stuck our intertwined hands in his jacket pocket as he began walking down the road with me in tow. \"Where you going?\" Dalton asked. \"To that grocery store we passed. I'm thirsty.\" \"Well, what about your sister and Wade, man?\" Nick looked slightly annoyed. Man, you'd think he'd be more worried, seeing as it's HIS sister we can't find... \"Maybe they're at the store.\" I pulled back slightly, stopping, and I could tell Dalton was thinking the same thing I was. Nick stopped. \"What?\" \"Idunno, we came all this way. You don't think we should go look for them?\" Dalton said. \"Yeah, babe. Come on. We didn't see them on the way here, they're not at the campsite... They have to be around here somewhere. We've only looked on place...\" \"Check it. I'm gonna go this way,\" he jerked his head in the direction of the grocery store. \"You go that way,\" he jerked his head in the opposite direction. We don't find them, we meet back here, go back to the road. Cool?\" \"Okay.\" Dalton agreed. I, however, didn't move. Nick stopped once again and turned around, walking back to where Dalton and I were still standing. \"Babe? You comin?\" \"Idunno, Nick. I just don't like the thought of splitting up. This is a strange town. I mean, look around. Have you seen ANYONE? There's no one walking the streets, there's no movement in the houses, there's no cars driving... The only person we've even seen back here is that creepy roadkill guy... I don't think it's safe to split up.\" \"Isabel, I'll be fine.\" Dalton assured me. \"I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself. Besides, if there's no one here, there's nothing to worry about, right?\" He smiled, and I knew that I wasn't going to win this arguement. \"Ugh, fine. Whatever, just ignore what I say. But when something bad happens to you, don't you dare say I didn't warn you.\" He smiled and pulled me in for a big, brotherly hug and kissed the top of my forehead. \"I love you, sis.\" \"I love you too, bro.\" I smiled and let him go. I went to where Nick was standing. He pulled me in, \"Everything's gonna be fine, kay?\" He tried to comfort me. I squeezed his hand and agreed, \"Yeah,\" but I didn't believe it. I didn't feel right letting my twin brother walk away like that. I don't know how Nick did it this morning. I know, this has been PRETTY DANG BORING so far. But It's gonna get better next chapter :D. Promise promise. xxx. Remember: Reviews are love. They're what helps me know that I'm doing SOMETHING right :P.[Chapter 3] It's been a while. I've been tres tres busy. Sorry! Nick and I turned back and began walking to the grocery store. Okay, this whole \"deserted town\" thing was getting a little creepy. I mean, yeah I've heard of ghost towns, but... this was weird. We walked past a few stores, all dark and empty, and a fair bit of houses, mostly dark, and... well... empty. I thought I saw a curtain moving, but no. That couldn't be. There's nothing in this God-Forsaken town to move a curtain. When we finally got to the grocery store, it was locked. And empty. Big shock there. Nick banged on the door, \"Yo, Paying customer!\" He yelled. \"Hello? Any one there?\" \"Babe, there's no one here.\" I told him dully. \"Did you really expect there to be?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Let's just go look for Carly and Wade.\" I suggested. \"Yeah.\" He backed away from the door and grabbed my hand. \"Maybe they're back at the gas station now? I'm sure they'll have drinks there.\" I suggested. We made the short walk back there, and just as we walked up on it there was a man walking out, closing the door behind him. \"Hey!\" Nick called out. The man turned around. \"I'm looking for my sister. And her boyfriend.\" \"They were looking for a fan belt or something.\" I mentioned. \"I don't think I've seen em.\" The man said. He didn't give it much thought, and I doubted he even cared about the question. \"This is the only gas station in town, right?\" I asked. \"That's right.\" \"Then they were definitely here.\" Nick said, like he believed him about as much as i did. \"I just told you, I didn't see em.\" The man was getting aggravated. \"Does somebody else work here?\" Nick asked. \"No. I own the station. And I would've seen them.\" \"Well, we were just here a few minutes ago, and you didn't see us...\" Nick pointed out. \"You weren't even here.\" I added. \"Sorry. Can't help you.\" The guy said dismissively. There was some kind of muffled squealing noise. Like a whine or something. \"What was that?\" \"Nothing. That was just my dog.\" The man brushed it off. \"Actually, you know what, My brother was down here for a while. He could've helped your sister out. They could be up at the house.\" He pointed in the direction Dalton had gone. \"No, my friend went that way earlier.\" Nick told him. \"Really? Well, maybe he ran into my brother up there, then.\" He turned around to tie his shoe, and when he stood up, that squealing noise was happening again, only louder and more urgent. \"Wanna head up to the house?\" \"Yeah, whatever.\" Nick agreed. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pulled me into him. As we started walking, the man walked up on my other side. I didn't like that. He was acting to strange earlier. The man freaked me out. He was attractive, yes. Very attractive. Especially for an older guy. Not that he was old, his dark hair wasn't even beginning to turn grey yet. But he was definitely older than me. I walked closer to Nick, who pushed me in front of him, then grabbed me with his other arm and took me to his side. Apparently, he didn't like me walking beside that man either. \"So, what's your sister look like anyway?\" The man asked. Then, \"NICK! ISABEL! HELP ME!\" We heard Carly scream from back at the station. I gasped as Nick pushed me back, hard. The man took a swing at him with something in his right hand, but missed. Nick got in two punches as I was standing up. We ran to the station, with the creep right behind us. We ran in the door, and I shut and locked it just in time. The man took off towards the garage part, so Nick ran in there and jumped on the door, keeping it closed while the man tried to open it. I grabbed a screw driver and put it in the side, so that the door was basically locked. The man took off towards the door again, and Nick followed. I don't know what happened next, I was looking for my best friend. \"Carly?\" I called. \"In here!\" It was coming from down the stairs in the back. I walked down them, but the door at the bottom wasn't budging. \"NICK!\" She yelled. \"CARLY?\" \"PLEASE HELP ME! I'M DOWN HERE!\" \"Down the steps, Nick.\" I told him. He came to where I was, and kicked the door open. Mmm. I knew this wasn't the time, but man... \"Carls! I yelled, as I noticed Carly, bound to a chair, blood pouring everywhere and smeared all over her mouth. She definitely looked worse for wear. \"Thank God.\" She whispered. \"Jesus.\" I said as I walked over to her. \"It's okay. I'm here. I got you.\" Nick told her comfortingly. He began pulling off the tape so she could move again. \"Watch my finger. Watch my finger.\" \"Oh, my God.\" I thought I was going to throw up. That's where all of the blood was coming from. \"He did this too you?\" Nick asked. She looked pained as I ripped off the bottom of the tank top she was wearing and wrapped it around her finger, trying my best to bandage it. \"Where is he?\" She asked. I wanted to know the answer to that question myself. Nick just ignored her as he looked for something. \"Where is he?\" \"I locked him out.\" He finally answered. He came back with a knife thing and cut the tape off her legs. \"Where the hell's Wade?\" I asked her. \"I-I don't know. He went into the house. This place is a FREAK SHOW!\" I held her up by her arms and helped her stand up. She was steady, which surprised me. Judging by the mess, she had lost a lot of blood. I looked at Nick. I wasn't sure what was happening. I didn't know what to do. What to expect. He was looking back at me. The same unsureness I felt mirrored on his face. We heard what sounded like a truck motor start up and drive away above us. \"He's leaving.\" Nick pointed out. \"C'mon.\" he whispered, wrapping an arm around me and grabbing onto Carly's arm. We made our way up the stairs. Still no sign of creeper. \"All right, stay here.\" He told us when we got to the door between the garage and the store. He ran to the garage door and checked outside. Then he went rummaging through all the tools on the tables. He picked up a wrench. \"Yeah.\" He walked over to where Carly and I were still standing, huddled together in fear of what would happen next. \"Alright, cars by the road.\" \"Dalton's got the keys.\" I reminded him. \"Dalton.\" He said his name as though he had forgotten that his best friend was out there somewhere in this crazy town. \"We gotta call the cops.\" He ran over to a phone hanging on the wall, but it was dead. Carly and I followed him into the store. \"Shit. Is, where's your phone?\" \"I-left it at the campsite.\" I realized just how stupid that was. Nick walked over to Carly and put his hands on her shoulders, speaking to her as though he wasn't quite sure she was stable minded. \"Hey, where's your cellphone?\" \"It might be in the truck, up near the house.\" He turned to look out the window. \"What about Wade? I think he has him too! What if he turns him into wax?\" \"What do you mean, wax?\" Nick turned around. Judging by the look on his face, he was thinking the same thing I was. Maybe she WASN'T mentally stable. \"You don't get it. They're all wax. Everyone!\" She turned to me. \"You believe me, right Is?\" I put my hand on her shoulder, \"Of course, Carls. Now c'mon. Let's go get your phone.\" I lead her over to where Nick was standing. \"No, wait.\" She told us. She carefully lead us out the door and down the street. Nick and I looked at each other, still unsure of what to do. He grabbed my hand and I held on for dear life. \"There was a woman in here. She was alive. She pulled the curtain back.\" She told us as she stopped in front of a gate. Nick jumped the gate and I stepped through the door with Carly. Like normal, civilized humans. Nick and I both stepped up on a brick to see in the window. He was perfect height, but I could barely see anything besides a glow. Then, the curtain moved. Nick and I both gasped and pulled back. But the person on the other side of the window didn't seem to see us. She just pushed the curtain back. A few seconds later, she pulled it open again. \"The whole town is rigged.\" Carly whispered. \"That's impossible.\" \"You're saying that that's a real person...\" Nick pulled me closer. \"...underneath?\" \"Yes! At the church, they were all like that! At least 20 more.\" Carly exclaimed, glad we finally believed her. \"Listen, on the way up to his house earlier, Bo told us a story. about two kids. Their parents moved them out here. Trudy did all the wax stuff, and the husband was a doctor, but he had his license revoked. He told us how Trudy died from a cyst in her brain and the Doc shot his brains out. I think.. I think it's him. And his brother... must be Vincent from the art up at the house...\" Nick looked around. \"We have to... find weapons. Protection. Get Dalton, Get Wade, Get out.\" I agreed. If we're going to survive in this freaky town, we would need protection. He pulled my hand and I grabbed onto Carly. We crossed the street carefully, towards the part of town with the stores. We were walking across a dark yard, and I could see a costume store ahead. Maybe?... \"He said he had a brother, right?\" Nick asked. \"Vincent.\" \"Yeah, at the house of wax, he did all the sculptures.\" Carly told him. \"Maybe he's the one that does all the wax.\" I suggested. \"What if he's around here somewhere?\" Carly sounded nervous. \"Yeah.\" Nick replied. I rolled my eyes. He's acting all tough. I could tell he was scared to death. He started pulling me toward the road. \"Wait!\" Carly whispered. \"What are you doing? Nick, you gotta be careful!\" \"I am being careful.\" Jackpot. A costume store with weapons in the front window. Nick pulled the wrench in his hand back like he was going to throw it at the store window. Carly quickly ran up and grabbed his arm. \"No, no, no! It'll make to much noise! Why do you have to be so damn stubborn?\" She rolled her eyes. \"He will find us.\" Nick turned on her. \"Yeah, chances are he will anyways. At least with his he might not wanna find us.\" He chucked the wrench and the window shattered. He jumped up to a man dressed in military uniform with a crossbow in his hands. \"That's about right.\" I could see the disgust in his eyes as he looked at the innocent person trapped in wax forever. *BANG! The glass on the store's door shattered. \"Go, Is, Carls, run!\" Nick said as he jumped out to us, as another shot was fired. He grabbed me and pulled me towards the theater, which was the closest building to us. I looked for Carly, but all I saw was a small figure, running as fast as she could, down the street away from us. I couldn't believe she'd just leave us like that. Maybe she'll get out alive. \"Carl.\" I gasped as we ran into the theater. Nick shook his head, pained. \"Just forget her, Is. She ran away from this guy, she ran to safety. She'll be waiting for us. We gotta survive for her. Forget her. Keep yourself alive.\" We ran into the screening room. When we did, a movie started playing. I didn't pay attention which one. \"Isabel. I want you to sit, okay? Blend in. I won't let him get you.\" He sat me in a chair. \"Nick...\" \"I love you, Is.\" He ran to the other corner of the theater, into the shadows. I heard the door open as Bo walked in. I froze, hoping he wouldn't realize the extra figure. He walked down the isle to the front of the room. \"I know you're in here!\" He was counting the people on a row, when I saw his eyes narrow. He started to live his gun. \"NICK!\" Nick shot up from the corner and shot him in the arm with his arrow. I got up and we met at the door. I heard a gunshot, but it didn't hit either of us. \"Is, hide behind the ticket stand. Don't make a sound.\" He kissed my forehead as I ducked down. Bo came out seconds later, and smiled evilly when he saw Nick standing there, pointed his crossbow at his chest. Nick fired, and the arrow hit his mark. Bo fell back, unmoving. I came out and stood by Nick, who picked up Bo's gun. \"Empty shells. Check him for ammo.\" I lightly pushed against him, to make sure he wouldn't wake, then got down and looked in all of his pockets. \"There's nothing in his pockets.\" I stood up and looked at Nick. \"Nick, what if Carly...\" \"No, Izzy. She's going to be fine. Carly's a tough girl.\" He pulled me in, and kissed me. \"She'll be fine.\" I sighed. \"Give me this.\" I grabbed the gun and threw it behind the counter. \"Nick, let's get out of here.\" We walked out the door and ran across the road so we could walk in the shadows. \"Psst!\" Nick stopped dead in his tracks and turned to look at me. \"What?\" He asked. I shook my head. \"It wasn't me, Nick.\" Maybe it was Carly! I thought hopefully. \"Carly?\" I whispered. \"Hey!\" We heard a female whisper coming from the shadows of a fence. Nick quickly pulled me behind him. \"Who is it?\" He called. \"Don't freak out. We're the good guys.\" A male voice said reassuringly. We stepped towards the sound, and two girls and a guy stepped out of the shadow. They all looked worse for wear. \"Two days ago, we were on a family trip, going to Texas, when we saw a sign for the house of wax. We decided to stop and check it out. But we had to leave our car up at some washed out swamp road thing. There were eight of us originally.\" \"My husband, two daughters, my youngest son, and my nephew were all killed by those... men. We somehow escaped being turned into wax. And I swore to stay here and try and revenge my family's deaths. But I haven't been able to get to the...men... to kill them.\" The oldest woman, who I guessed was the mom, told us. \"I'm Sarah. This is my oldest son, Chad and my niece, Kate.\" Nick was looking at them like he didn't know wether or not to trust them. He still had me sheilded behind him. I decided to take charge, and stepped in front of him. \"We were on our way to a game in Baton Rouge. We decided to camp in a clearing, and some friends had to come here for a fanbelt. When they didn't come back, we came looking. We have two friends still at the camp site, my cousin and my brother are around here somewhere, and his sister just took off, running that way.\" I pointed to where she had went. \"I'm Isabel. This is Nick.\" so, yeah. lame ending, but here's where the twist starts :D. I'll try and get this next chapter out quicker. xxx.[Chapter 4] OKAY! Short chapter... But it's my first update in ages. Unfortunately, the computer I was writing this on crashed. Hopefully it'll be fixed in the next few days. Sorry for the wait!. \"My husband, two daughters, my youngest son, and my nephew were all killed by those... men. We somehow escaped being turned into wax. And I swore to stay here and try and revenge my family's deaths. But I haven't been able to get to the...men... to kill them.\" The oldest woman, who I guessed was the mom, told us. \"I'm Sarah. This is my oldest son, Chad and my niece, Kate.\" Nick was looking at them like he didn't know wether or not to trust them. He still had me sheilded behind him. I decided to take charge, and stepped in front of him. \"We were on our way to a game in Baton Rouge. We decided to camp in a clearing, and some friends had to come here for a fanbelt. When they didn't come back, we came looking. We have two friends still at the camp site, my cousin and my brother are around here somewhere, and his sister just took off, running that way.\" I pointed to where she had went. \"I'm Isabel. This is Nick.\" The mom, Sarah, and son, Chad, smiled their hellos, while Kate looked around nervously. \"We should get out of the open. Follow us.\" She whispered to Nick and I. The group took off, and I started to follow when Nick grabbed my arm. \"Isabel. Are you crazy?\" He sounded slightly pissed. \"Nick. They're people. Look at them! They've obviously been through a rough time! I get a good feeling about them! C'mon. Nick, I'm not just standing out here in the open. I think we should follow them!\" I looked to where the group had run off, and noticed they were still standing there, watching us. \"Just one second, please?\" The mom nodded. \"Nick...\" \"Isabel. We're in a strange town. Where some strange shit has been happening. The last guy we walked off with tried to kill us!\" \"And that guy is still out there! Nick... C'mon. Please.\" I begged. He sighed, and I could tell he was thinking. \"Alright,\" He spoke loud enough the group could hear him. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and lead me over to where the group was still standing. \"Everything okay?\" Sarah asked. \"Yeah, nothin' personal. Just don't know who to trust.\" Nick mumbled. Kate smiled understandingly. \"Well, c'mon.\" Chad whispered. We ran through the shadows, between the houses. We got to a backyard where the fence had a little board moved. Kate, Chad and Sarah crawled through. I looked at Nick, just to be sure. He nodded. \"I'll go first. If I say run, run. I'll catch up later.\" He kissed my forehead, then my nose, then my mouth. \"I love you, Is.\" \"I love you, Nick.\" He sighed, dropped to the ground, and crawled through the hole. I waited a few seconds. \"Nick?\" \"It's fine, Is. Come on through.\" I dropped and followed him through. When I got to the other side, I saw Sarah and Kate still standing in the backyard, and I assumed Chad was in the house, having gone through the open door. \"Chad's inside, checking out the house.\" Kate explained. I nodded and joined the three of them by the door. A couple minutes passed before Chad appeared in the doorway. \"All clear.\" He motioned us inside. We all quickly fell in the house into a kitchen, and he shut the door. Looking around, I couldnt see much of anything. There were no lights besides the moonlight coming from outside. We followed the three survivors out of the kitchen, down a hallway, and into a room that appeared to be a bedroom. \"We stay in here because there are no windows.\" Sarah explained, as she lit a few candles. \"We keep the rest of the house dark so that they don't know anything's up. We don't have much food left, but you're welcome to eat whatever you find. There are a few more bedrooms, that you guys are free to use, but we usually stay in one room. Much easier to keep watch that way.\" I hadn't realized how hungry I was up until she mentioned the food earlier. But I wouldn't feel right, taking their food... So I slid to the floor and Nick followed me, pulling me into his chest, kissing my head. \"I'm sure you guys are hungry. Don't be shy about it! Here!\" Kate reached into a bag and pulled out two plastic bags with sandwiches in them. \"Do you guys like peanut butter?\" We both nodded as she tossed the bags to us, then tossed us two water bottles. We gratefully ate and drank, the little sandwhich not exactly filling me up, but at least stopping the starving pains. \"So... Where were you guys from?\" I asked, hoping for a conversation to fill the dread. Sarah supplied. \"We're from Atlanta, Georgia. We were headed to San Antonio for my sisters wedding. Look's like we're going to miss it. What about you kids?\" \"Gainesville, Florida. The big game up in Baton Rouge? We were going to watch it. Then we woke up this morning, and my cousins cars fan belt had been cut. Nicks sister, Carly, our friend Paige, and myself were walking through the woods when Carly fell into a roadkill pit. While we were standing there, this man drove up and threw more animals onto the pit. That guy took Carly and Wade, my cousin, to the town to get a fan belt from Bo's gas station. Blake, who drove his truck, Paige, his girlfriend, Dalton, my brother, Nick and myself crammed into Blakes truck to head up to get tickets and Carly and Wade were supposed to meet us there. We ended up turning back because the traffic was so bad we never would have made it.\" I wasn't planning on telling our whole life story, but once I started, I couldn't stop. I kept going and going and going. I dont know when I started crying, but by the time I finished with \"And here we are...\" I was sobbing. I couldn't believe how unbelievably screwed we were. \"Isabel, we'll be okay.\" Nick reassured me. \"So, as far as you know, everyone's still alive?\" Chad asked. \"Yes. Blake and Paige are still at the campsite, so they might be okay. It's just Wade, Carly and Dalton I'm worried about...\" I told him. \"We were camping in a clearing, like you guys were. We all walked into town and stupidly split up. Kind of like you guys did... But we'll find your friends. We'll try our hardest.\" Kate promised. \"We've been making plans as to how to kill the animals that killed our family, but... if you two want in, then we'll have a higher chance of succeeding...\" Sarah hinted. \"We're in.\" Nick didn't even think about it. \"Great. We'll come up with better plans... but maybe we should do it tomorrow. I don't think Isabel is going to last much longer.\" It was true. I was about to pass out from exhaustion, and Nicks chest was just so comfortable. \"Like I said earlier, you can stay in here with us, or you can go to one of the other rooms. It's up to you guys.\" Nick looked down at me, and I shrugged. \"I think we'll take up one of those other rooms, thank you.\" Nick told the group. \"Thank you guys. For all of this.\" He stood up and just as I was about to crawl up, he lifted me into his arms. Chad got up to open the door. \"Thanks, man.\" \"It's no problem. And there's always someone awake in here, so whenever you wake up, just come on in.\" He told us. Nick walked into the hallway and went one door over. The bed in there was nice and warm as he laid me down. I kicked off my shoes and pulled off my clothes, sleeping only in my bra and underwear. He pulled the covers up around me, shut the door, pulled of his clothes and climbed into the bed with me. \"Nick...\" I was almost alseep and still slightly disoriented from the crying. \"What if...\" \"Everything will work out.\" Nick hushed me. \"I love you.\" He kissed my forehead as he pulled me into my spot in the crook of his arm. Safety. Then I was out. Yeah, once again, lame ending! sorry! But here's the twist you guys have been asking for. (: xxxx.[Chapter 5] Okay, here's another chapter :D. Another short one, unfortunately. And yeah, as I'm getting farther and farther into this, I'm getting farther away from the actual script of the movie... I know that this isn't actually how it happens in the movies... But I suppose why this is a FAN fic :P. So, I hope you like it. xxx. \"It's no problem. And there's always someone awake in here, so whenever you wake up, just come on in.\" He told us. Nick walked into the hallway and went one door over. The bed in there was nice and warm as he laid me down. I kicked off my shoes and pulled off my clothes, sleeping only in my bra and underwear. He pulled the covers up around me, shut the door, pulled of his clothes and climbed into the bed with me. \"Nick...\" I was almost asleep and still slightly disoriented from the crying. \"What if...\" \"Everything will work out.\" Nick hushed me. \"I love you.\" He kissed my forehead as he pulled me into my spot in the crook of his arm. Safety. Then I was out. When I woke up the next morning, like the night before, it seemed like it had been no time. I was unsure of what had woken me, seeing as I felt like I could have slept for hours. Then I realized that someone was staring at us. I shot up into a sitting position, gasping. Nick followed, \"What? Isabel?\" I relaxed a little when I realized it was just Sarah, but Kate hadn't seemed to caught on yet. He grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me to face him. \"Isabel?\" The worry was obvious in his voice. Awe. He's so adorable when he's worried. \"Sorry, Nick. I just... felt someone watching us. But it's just Sarah.\" I answered him, kissing his cheek. \"Go back to sleep.\" I went to get up out of the bed so I could talk with Sarah, and he followed. \"I'm up now.\" He replied. We quickly threw on our clothes from yesterday, while talking with Sarah. She told us she was just coming to check on us, to make sure nothing had happened during the night. How sweet of her. She really was a nice woman. The whole group were nice. It was such a shame that this had to happen to them. Nick and I followed her to the room where they had stayed during the night, and I was very excited to see that they had set aside plates of sandwiches and chips. I was starving. We quickly scarfed down the food while discussing plans with the others. During the day, the explored close by and rested. The night was their time. They had been attempting to get to the brothers ever since the first night they spent in this place after their family had been waxed. Obviously, they hadn't succeeded. \"I think the house would be our best bet.\" Chad chimed in. \"Distract them out of the house, two of us slip in there, when they come in, we give them what they deserve.\" The house... \"My cousin went in the house and never came out.\" I told them. \"Maybe he's still in there somewhere.\" I wasn't too hopeful, but it beat being pessimistic. \"We need to get to the museum. Dalton never came back from there. He might be hiding out...\" Nick added, sounding not hopeful, but desperate. \"And your sister ran off in the direction of the museum, from what you've told us.\" Kate chipped in. \"Nick, we've got to find them. Even if they're... wax... I can't leave, knowing that there's even the SMALLEST possibility that they could be alive.\" I turned to look at him, and he nodded, agreeing. The day passed pretty uneventful. By night fall, we had figured out that Sarah, Kate and Chad would get the brothers out of the house. Ring the doorbell and run. Try and kill whoever followed if possible. Nick and I, not wanting to be separated, would slip into the house and wait. At first, Chad was opposed to it being me who goes in the house with Nick, but Sarah and Kate seemed to understand. They had seen, in such a short time, how much the two of us depend on each other. Nick was just happy with the fact that he would be able to protect me as much as possible. I spent pretty much the entire day not talking. I was nervous, I was upset, I was sad, I was excited, and I was pissed off. Nobody deserved to have any of this shit happen to them. Why us? Why our friends? And why Sarah, Kate and Chad? They were just as nice as we were. Why are these brothers so vicious? What happened to mess them up THIS bad? We didn't see the brothers, or anybody, pass by the house all day. I wasn't quite sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Finally, it was dark enough for us to go out. Sarah came and got Kate, Nick and myself from where we had been sitting in one of the bedrooms. She pulled us into the living room, where Chad had been watching out the window for the past hour or so. \"Alright, guys. It's time. This is going to be dangerous... But I suppose we all expected that. Nick, Isabel, I've only known you guys one day now, but you're both lovely people. Let's go over the plan once more. Kate, the fastest, is going to run up and simply knock on the door, wait for it to open, then run off. When the brothers come out, she will run away, towards town, where I will be waiting to jump out and run with her, and maybe distract the brothers a little bit. When we get into town, Chad will use the crossbow and one arrow that Nick has brought to us. You two will slip in the house, find whatever weapon, and wait. We will run back to the house with whichever remains of the brothers, when we run in the house, be prepared.\" Sarah had thought hard over this. She seemed to have the same mix of emotions displaying in her eyes as I was feeling. Everyone nodded agreement with the plan. \"Let's go, kids.\" Nick grabbed his arm around my waist as we followed the family of three out of the kitchen into the back yard and out through the broken board in the fence. As he pulled me to my feet after crawling through the fence, he kissed my forehead and whispered, \"I love you, Isabel.\" I didn't let go of his hand as we followed the family behind the houses, through the shadows, where Chad hid behind a fence at the last house. The rest of us continued up to where we could see the house. There was one truck parked outside, and it was hanging halfway off of a little hill. We ran up and hid behind the truck. Sarah pointed to the side of the house and whispered, \"Side door. Good luck!\" Nick nodded. I whispered, \"You too.\" Nick and I ran to the side of the house and hid, waiting for the brothers to come out. We heard the BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG of Kate knocking on the door. My heart began racing. We were going in here with no protection! How stupid! I saw a baseball bat in the corner of the house, and quickly grabbed it. \"HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?\" Bo yelled as he shot off after Kate. Sarah quickly joined her in her run, and Bo was off. But that was only one brother. Where was the other one? Vincent? Still in the house, maybe? That would make this go a bit easier. Well, I guess this was our time. \"Ready?\" Nick questioned me. I nodded. \"Is, I hate taking you in here. Remember, if I tell you to run, run. Don't argue. And for Christ's sake, PLEASE, be careful?\" I nodded again. \"I swear, if we make it out of this, I'm going to marry you.\" He looked back at the door, hesitated, then pushed it open. Inside was a mess. There was boxes and random knick knacks and pictures everywhere. Lamps were lit all through out the house, so it wasn't too dark, but I couldn't see the other brother. \"Nick, only one brother came out. The other one might be in here still!\" He thought for a second. \"Is, I don't want to leave you alone, but I need you to stand by the door and look out, if you see anyone, come get me. I'm going to go through the rooms back here, see if he's hiding out.\" He kissed my forehead and left. I walked over to the window by the door, and looked out. I couldn't see Chad, Kate, Sarah, or either of the brothers. Looking for clues as to who these guys were, I began going through the drawers. The first one I opened had a bunch of pictures. In every picture, there were two boys, one with a normal face, and one wearing a mask, covering his entire face. It was always the same mask, pale, with a grim look, and you could only see one eye through the eye holes. Picture after picture, it was the same thing. Birthdays, Playing at the park, School, Christmas morning, Playing in the backyard... then... a baby picture. But, in this picture, the babies were joined. At the head. The front right half of one babies face was connected to the back of the other babies head. So... if they were separated... that explains the mask... Poor kid. Then there was movement. Another truck pulled up, and I could see something hanging out of the back. A man, who I was guessing was Vincent, got out and walked around back. Wait... That something... Oh, no... No! Paige... Blake... No... Nick! I had to get Nick. I quickly dropped the pictures back into the drawer, and ran back to where I had seen Nick go off. \"Nick?\" I whisper/yelled. \"Nick! He's here! Vincent! Nick?\" I felt hands grab me and pull me into a room to the left. \"Isabel. I found a...\" \"Nick!\" I cut him off. \"Vincents back, and he has Paige and Blake. In the back of his truck. They're... dead.\" He stopped looking around and looked directly into my eyes. The first two that we were absolutely positive were dead. Our friends... \"Is...\" \"What did you find?\" I cut him off again. \"A door. In the floor. I opened it up, and I couldn't see where it goes. I think we should go down there.\" \"Nick, we were supposed to stay here and kill the brothers! Vincent should be coming in any second now! We had a plan!\" \"Isabel, what if Dalton, Wade and Carly are down there? Maybe there's some weapons down there! We have nothing to kill these guys with, besides a baseball bat. I'm going down here. Are you coming or not?\" Like I said, a short chapter. That isn't exactly along the script.. But I'm liking it so far. (:. I hope you guys are too. :D leave me review love? :D. Next chapter will be out as soon as possible. xxx.[Chapter 6] Hey guys. I just wanna let you guys know, I'm hoping to finish this story, but I was literally mid-word when my inspiration just completely left me :/.

I had a few chapters written out for this, but I'm just not satisfied with them, so I won't post them :/. But hopefully it'll be soon :D. I'm sorry to the people that were reading this, forgive me?

I'm still working on my HHE story, and I've g"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Road trip to hell","Author":"WideAwake94","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8381149","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Enjoy ! \"Okay, here's one in Tribeca for three thousand.\" Paige pointed out to Carly who looked completely hopeless \"That's still way too much. All the money I saved up won't even cover two months rent. I'm going to have to work every minute I'm not in class until graduation.\" She answered putting down the newspaper and rubbing her temples. \"Don't you even dare to think about not going!\" I told her firmly \"I'm not.\" She answered. \"Good. Because you know how proud we are of you.\" Paige told her \"It's just an internship\" Carly said like it was a simple job \"Yeah at InStylemagazine!\" I exclaimed \"Or you could just stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" I asked her she made a disgusted face \"No, thanks.\" She answered \"Yeah, that's what I thought. Now pass me the French fries.\" She did and handed the paper to Paige. Wade appeared from somewhere and dropped in the sit next to Carly \"Hey, babe\" and gave her a kiss on the forehead and turned to smile at us \"Hey, Allison, Paige\" he greeted me which made me smile at him \"Holla\" I winked which made him and Carly laugh. \"Sorry, there were two drunken rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.\" Wade said turning to Carly. \"There are no rednecks in New York\" Paige said lifting her head from the paper, giving Wade a look. \"No there isn't\" Wade answered her looking uncomfortable which made Carly glared at her and the atmosphere got tense. Thankfully Paige broke it \"Well I'd better go see what Blake's doing. He seems to like that car more than me nowadays.\" She stated and started to head there. \"Well at that note I'm gonna go find my guy too\" just as I said that Nick got out from the diner with Dalton who was holding his camera of course behind Nick. There was a homeless man sitting on the ground and when he lifted his cup Nick kicked it. god his bad guy attitude lately was getting frustrating \"Or not\" I told them again turning back to Carly and Wade. Nick dropped at the sit the next to me and Dalton next to him \"Hey, babe\" and leaned in for a kiss \"Hey\" I answered against his lips. I returned eating my French fries \"So, what do you think guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?\" Wade asked them nervously \"Yeah\" Nick answered simply putting his arm around me then out of nowhere someone passed us holding fish and quickly gave me nausea Carly looked at me alarmed \"I'm gonna go to the bathroom\" I told them and got up quickly and headed there quickly. when I got there I threw up. After I did I rinsed my mouth with water and splashed some on my face I saw Carly behind me looking worried \"You know you're gonna have to tell him soon right? He'll notice it…\" she told me. \"I know I have too but I'm scared and with everything that happed I don't know how to tell him\" I answered her \"Allison, you're gonna start showing soon.\" She told me \"Can we not talk about it okay? I'll tell him just not now\" I finished. She nodded and hugged me. Thankfully Blake agreed that I'll ride with him and Paige so I headed to his car while Carly headed to Wade's. We drove for how long I don't know I lost track. Blake was driving and Paige was looking at her self in the mirror which didn't surprise me she reached for her lip balm but before she could apply it she dropped it near Blake's leg she tried to reach it but couldn't \"Shit, Allie can you see where is it?\" she asked \"Yeah, move over I'll grab it\" it fell near the paddle so I reached forward and bent down trying to reach it finally I grabbed it when suddenly I heard a car horn who made me jump I leaned back and saw Carly and Wade laughing and Dalton filming of course and Nick who looked like he could kill someone I hit Blake's arm annoyed when I saw him smirking at them Paige called Carly \"Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm and I couldn't reach it so Allison picked it up.\" She explained and they started talking \"It's getting late. What do you wanna do?\" Paige asked turning to look at Blake \"Keep going, we don't even have tickets.\" Blake answered her looking at the road at this point I stopped listening and leaned my head on the window trying to fall asleep. \"Allie wake up, were stopping to camp\" Paige woke me up I nodded and sat up. Blake parked the car and we got out \"Allie, Paige come help me set this up\" Carly told us and we started walking with her. when we reached in front of Wade's car we stopped \"Well?\" Carly asked Paige \"I couldn't, there's no point in freaking him out right now.\" She answered \"As opposed to when you find out you're pregnant?\" Carly said popping her eyes \"Guys, I'm not sure, okay?\" she answered defending herself \"He's been looking forward to this game for months, I don't wanna ruin it by starting a fight.\" She tried to explain \"Paige, he's not going to marry you his parents won't let him.\" I told her Paige only smiled shaking her head \"Who says I want to get married? Besides, I've been late before.\" \"When I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay?\" we nodded. \"Anyway, when are you going to tell Nick? You're going to start showing soon\" she asked looking at me so did Carly \"Soon okay I just don't know how\". After we settled everything the boys started playing football of course Nick didn't join he sat at his chair looking at them play. I was sitting with Paige and Carly chatting when we saw the ball fall next to Nick and Wade waiting for him to throw back the ball which of course didn't happen Wade sighed and went over to get the ball bit just as he reached Nick got up suddenly and threw the ball at Blake who stumbled a little I became nervous and Carly went over there trying to prevent a fight I saw Wade walking away and Nick and Carly talking and Carly for a few minutes when she turned around and walked back to me and Paige and sat back holding back tears \"He's an asshole I don't blame you for not telling him\". \"Hey, what did he say?\" I asked her concerned and putted a hand on hers \"It doesn't matter okay.\" And dropped the conversation which made me angry I got up and went over to Nick \"What did you say to your sister?\" I asked him he only rolled his eyes \"Doesn't matter\" he mumbled and Ignored me just as I was going to answer him the wind picked up and the most repulsive smell came with it which made my stomach turn and I ran to the bushes to puke. While I was puking my guts out I saw Carly walking over with a bottle of water, after I finished I rinsed my mouth and we walked back to the others. After we headed back I sat in Nick's lap and he putted his arm around me leaning his chin on my shoulder kissing my neck. \"You okay?\" he asked whispering in my ear. \"Mhm, better\" I answered and turned my head to him and kissed him. When I pulled away I saw Carly running to Dalton and taking the camera from him \"Oh, and the tables turn.\" She told him Focusing the camera on him laughing evilly. \"Look how cute you are on camera. I think we might have to do a little makeover.\" She said and I immediately jumped from Nick laps \"Makeover!\" I shouted clapping my hand's happily making everyone laugh. I pulled him to the tent and pushed him in and we dressed him on a yellow jacket and some Glittery sunglasses. \"You're coming out.\" Carly stepped outside first laughing with Dalton's camera in her hand. \"I don't know.\" Dalton said hesitant. \"If you don't, I will be so mad.\" At this point she was already outside waiting for him. Dalton shook his head no \"Oh, no you don't\" I said and pushed him outside and that made him stumble a little \"Look how good you look!\" Carly said beaming at him and laughing while filming him. Dalton stood in front of the boys and waved \"Hey\". \"He looks like Elton John, but more gay.\" Blake's said making us laugh. \"Elton John is gay?\" Dalton pretended to be shocked. I quickly ran over to Nick and sat in his lap giving him a kiss and we started to make out. Suddenly a bright light shone at us making us pull away and I saw a truck up the hill. \"Yeah?\" Wade shouted. \"Hey, yo, man, you need something?\" Blake shouted too straightening up. \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade asked but nothing happened the truck only stood there \"Babe I don't like this\" I whispered to Nick starting to get worried. Blake held his hands up and making a shooing motion, \"Hey, come on, man, get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.\" Still nothing happened. \"Can we help you?\" Wade asked standing up. \"Maybe we're on his property.\" Carly stated. \"No, we didn't pass a gate.\" Wade said shaking his head moving forward. \"Hey man, turn off your lights!\" Blake shouted getting angry. \"I'm serious man, turn your lights off, or I'm whopping someone's ass!\" But wade stopped him putting a hand on his chest. \"It's alright, it's cool, man.\" Suddenly Nick pushed me from his lap making me frown. He stood up and threw the beer bottle at the truck smashing the right front headlight. \"Nick!\" Carly screamed in disbelief. Nick ignored her as he made his way to the front of everyone, glaring at the truck. Dalton stood behind him and lifted his hands \"What?\". We stood there waiting for something to happen but nothing did the truck backed and drove away making me sigh in relief. \"My man Nick here's hardcore!\" Blake told him. I shook my head in disbelief and started to head to tent I shared with Nick as much I love Dalton the last thing I wanted was to wake up with him filming me. Just as I reached the tent a pair of wrapped around me making me gasp \"Only me\" I heard Nick. I turned around and hit his arm \"You asshole! You scared me\" and that only made him laugh \"Sorry Babe\" and leaned on to kiss me. \"You better\" I whispered against his lips \"Love you\" he said making me smile \"Love you too\". I took his hand we entered our tent Nick closed the tent's zipper. Just as he did I pulled him to me and started to kiss him hard. he returned the kiss, I tore off his coat and shirt leaving his shirtless my cloth coming off too. Soo what do you think? Review :)[Chapter 2] The next day Blake woke us up screaming for us to get up. When I did I saw that Nick was still asleep after a few minutes of annoying him he finally got up. After I got out from the tent I went with Carly and Paige to pee. \"So, you and Wade talk some more?\" Paige asked Carly after we finished our business. \"We're just in different places right now, He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying\" Carly answered. Then that disgusting smell came back \"Oh, my God, there's that smell again\" Paige said lifting her hand to cover her nose, I did the same. \"I think it's coming from over there\" Carly said starting to go to the direction the smell came from \"Yeah, let's just follow the smell\" I said sarcastically. \"What? I wanna see what it is\". Carly answered while walking \"Come on\". I rolled and started to follow. Paige eventfully followed too. The smell started to get worse as we walked \"Oh, my God I cannot believe you're making me do this.\" Paige complained \"I hate you\". \"I'm gonna throw up\" I added Carly only laughed at our compliments when suddenly she slipped and fell \"Carly!\" I shouted worried \"Carly!\" I shouted again after a few seconds she screamed back \"Allison! I'm stuck!\" and started to scream for help \"Go the the guys quickly!\" I told Paige and she ran to get them I slipped down a little to her \"Carly hey Paige went to get the guys okay they'll be here soon\". Just as I said that I heard them \"Guys! Get down here!\" I shouted Carly started freaking out Wade started slipping down the hill to her \"Baby I'm here\" he said trying to calm her down \"Wade! Where are you!\" she screamed finally he reached and grabbed her pulling her from the road kill. I jumped a little when someone grabbed my hand but I saw it was Nick and calmed down \"You okay hon?\" he asked \"Yeah\". After we calmed down a little we saw a truck driving towards the road kill \"Hey, is that the truck from last night?\" Blake asked us. \"Not unless he fixed his headlight\" Wade answered. The truck stopped and a man who looked like he needed a shower badly came from inside it and went to back of the truck and grabbed a dead deer from it throwing it to the pit. \"Hey!\" Wade called gabbing his attention as her turned to look at us. \"Don't you see that?\" Carly asked pointing a finger to the hand sticking out \"What is that?\". The men didn't answer only stepped down while throwing the deer from the back of the truck and went to where the hand was, when he reached he bent down to grab \"No way\". Wade said in disbelief. I grabbed Nick's hand starting to panic and in return he putted an arm around my waist pulling me to him. \"What are you doing, man?\" Wade asked him. The man only grabbed the hand and started pulling it and after a few pulls the hand popped out of the pile making him stumble back a little \"Anyone need a hand?\" he asked us starting to laugh. \"I'm just fooling. It's not real, see?\" he said and showed us the hand still tapping on it to prove it while smiling. \"God.\" Carly said rolling her eyes and went over to where Paige and Blake stood. \"I found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago,\" The man said. \"What are you guys doing here?\". I shrugged Nick hand over me and went to Carly and Paige \"Hey you OK?\" I asked Carly as I reached them. \"Yeah, just freaked out\" she answered. \"I got some water in here I think\" Paige told her and got out a water bottle and Carly started to clean her hands. Dalton approached us \"Hey you guys seen my camera by any chance?\" I looked at him annoyed \"Are you serious?\" I asked him \"No\" Carly answered. \"Damm\" he cursed. \"I need a fan belt\" we heard Wade say. \"What?\" Carly said and turned to look at him. \"Just busted\" he answered her. \"Of course. Perfect\" Carly said sarcastic continuing to wash her hands. \"Bo might have one, Runs a station in Ambrose.\" The man said looking at Wade. \"Where's that?\" wade asked him. \"Fifteen miles up the road.\" \"Let's just get one in Baton Rouge, well put it on and well get back\" Blake interfered. \"Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car\" Wade told him what is that guy from last night strips it or something?\". \"You're gonna miss the game, then.\" Blake told him. \"Yeah, that's not why I came\" Wade answered. \"I'll Wright then look, \"I'll run you up to the station let's go now Kickoff's in a couple of hours\". Wade only shook his head. \"You're already late. You gotta snag tickets. Y'all should go now. I'll stay with my car, it's fine. Just get me a fan belt on the way back, and make sure it's a 15 inch\" Wade said. Blake said \"Gotcha\" and shook his hand \"I'll give you a ride\" the man said from where he was standing. \"You serious?\" Wade asked in disbelief. \"If you like\" the man said shrugging. \"Well, yeah, yeah it's cool\". \"I'm going with you\" Carly said making me and Paige look at her in disbelief \"Carly, no\" but she didn't listen to me. \"I'll be fine\" she assured me and went to Wade \"Alright, let's go.\" Blake told us. \"Carly.\" Nick called to Carly \"What?\" she asked turning to look at him he only took off his shirt he extended his hand with the shirt and Carly realized he was offering her his shirt. The gesture made me smile and I followed after Blake and Paige but stopped to wait for Nick, after a few minutes they appeared when they reached me I smiled at Nick completely ignoring Dalton he smiled back and came towards me and kissed me \"Yeah it's not like I'm here or something\" Dalton told us sarcastically \"Go away\" I answered and kissed Nick he rolled his eyes and left \"Finally!\" I whispered and continued kissing him suddenly he grabbed my ass making me gasp in shock making him slip his tongue I putted my hands around his neck pulling him closer and we started to make out, the kiss started to become passionate and before we got there I polled away making him groan \"As much as I want too, were in the middle of the woods and the others are waiting for us\" he only rolled his eyes and smirked \"Quickie?\" I only laughed and pulled him with me walking back to camp. \"Dude, its over\" Nick said leaning his head on the window. \"It'll move!\" Blake argued from the front. \"It's not moving\" I told him \"look we'll make the second half\" Blake continued to argue. \"OK dude I'm not sitting throw this traffic\" Nick told him. \"Well what do you want me to do?\" Blake asked him \"Go back\" Nick said like it was the obvious thing in the world \"I'm not missing the beat game of the year!\". We only glared at him and started to argue with Blake about turning around finally he gave up and banged his head on the horn. Paige pulled out her phone to call Carly and tell her that we were heading back. I leaned my head on Nick's shoulder and he putted his arm around me \"I love you\" he whispered to me making me smile I turned my head and kissed him making Dalton groan.[Chapter 3] After we pulled back at camp Blake stetted the tent. Paige and I sat on the ground while the guys went to pee. \"Hey, Paige!\" Blake yelled over to us. \"Yeah?\" She asked, turning to him \"Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them\" he told us \"You can go with them if you want Allie\". \"Okay I'll go\" I answered. \"Why? We can go\" Paige asked him \"Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving\" Blake complained. Paige only shrugged \"You know that not the reason right\" I asked her laughing she only laughed joining me \"You gonna tell him?\" I asked her quietly \"I'll tell him if you tell Nick\" she replayed I considered it \"Fine Deal\" I told her and reached put my arm \"Deal\" and we shook arm. I got up and went over to Nick and Dalton who already got in the car I hopped in the back \"Have fun I know I wont\" I shouted at them winking, they only laughed and Nick started driving to where Carly described. I leaned my head on the window thinking about how I would tell him I was deep in though when I noticed Nick looking at me throw the side mirror worried apparently he saw that I was in deep thought I smiled to him trying to make him relaxed and I saw him relax a little and went back to looking at the road. When Nick stopped the car all we went outside and I saw a gap in the grind making it impossible to go threw it with a car. \"Is this it?\" Dalton asked, turning to Nick \"Yeah\". I went over to stand next to Nick. Well, should we drive through it, you think?\" Dalton asked. \"Through all that?\" Nick asked looking at him like he was crazy. Dalton scratched his chin \"I don't know. I could do it\". I only laughed \"Ha\" Nick said laughing and handed him the keys Dalton took them and looked at the car then at the gap. \"That's what I thought\" Nick said and grabbed my hand and started walking throw the gap \"Come on idiot\" I called Dalton and he started walking too. After we walked for a while we reached the town and spotted the gas station and went to it and we could hear music coming from inside it \"Hello?\" Dalton asked as he walked up to the door. Nick and I stood close by waiting. \"Carly? Wade? Hello?\" Dalton shouted into the shop but nobody answered which was weird \"Man, there's music playing, but I don't think anyone's here\" Dalton told us closing the door walking to us \"No one's here.\" Nick said, putting his hands in his pockets. \"But there's music maybe he can't hear us?\" I asked he just shook his head and grabbed my hand pulling me with him I started to follow confused \"Where you going?\" Dalton asked following. \"To that grocery store we passed. I'm thirsty.\" Nick replied, continuing to walk towards the grocery store with me. \"Well, what about your sister and Wade, man?\" Dalton asked, chewing on the tip of his thumb still following. \"Maybe they're at the store\" Nick shrugged and kept walking with me. We heard Dalton running to reach us \"What?\" Nick asked stopping and turned to look at him I did the same. \"I don't know, man. I mean we came all this way. You don't think we should just look for them?\" Dalton asked stopping to chewing his thumb and tucked his hands into his pockets waiting for an answer. \"Alright, check it. I'm gonna go this way, Allison will come with me alright?\" Nick told him pointing to the direction with his head \"You go that way. We don't find them, we meet back here, go back to the road cool?\" he told him pointing to the other direction. Dalton nodded \"Okay\". We started walking to the store when we reached there Nick went to open the door but it was locked \"Yo, paying customer.\" Nick yelled tapping at the glass door \"Hello?\". \"Babe I need to talk to you\" I was now or never \"Can It wait? The damm store is closed and Dalton is probably waiting knowing his scared ass\". Or maybe not \"Yeah it can\". He grabbed my hand and we walked back and saw a man walking out closing the door \"Hey\" Nick called out getting the man's attention I'm looking for my sister and her boyfriend they were looking for a fan belt or something\". The man only shook his head no \"I don't think I've seen them\" and walked over to the garage door. \"This is the only gas station in town, right?\" Nick asked. \"That's right\" the man answered pulling the door down closing it. \"Yeah, then they were definitely here\" Nick stated not believing him. \"I just told you, I didn't see them\" the man answered leaning against the door. \"Well, does someone else work here?\" I asked him. \"No, I own the station. And I would have seen them\" he answered coming towards me. \"Well, we were just here a few minutes ago and you didn't see us.\" Nick pointed out \"You weren't even here\". The man stopped in front of us \"Sorry, Can't help you\" he told us. Suddenly we heard something that sounded like a muffled voice \"What was that?\" I asked him suspicious. \"Nothing. That was just my dog\" he answered me smiling and turned his back to me \"Actually, you know what? My brother Vincent was down here for a while. He could've helped your sister out. They could be up at the house.\" He answered pointing toward a direction Nick and I turned to look at that direction and when we turned \"Yeah, my friend went that way earlier\" Nick told him. \"Really?\" he said tying his shoe \"Well, maybe he ran into my brother up there, then.\" And stood back up. \"Wanna head up to the house?\" he asked pointing to the direction of the house \"Yeah, whatever\" Nick said putting his arm around me and we started to walk with the man I strengthened my grip on Nick I didn't trust this guy there was something off about him \"So, what's you sister look like anyway?\" The man asked glancing over at Nick. \"Nick! Allison! Help me!\" I heard Carly I quickly freaked out and saw the man pulling a knife Nick pushed me towards the station as he punched the guy making him fall over I quickly ran to the shop Nick right behind me and closed the door the man banged at the door and Nick locked it and we saw the man looking to the direction of the garage running to that direction Nick ran over there quickly \"Carly! Where are you?\" I screamed \"Allie I'm down here!\" I started running from where her voice was coming \"Allison Please help me!\" I ran down a staircase I saw a door but it was locked \"Nick!\" I screamed \"Down here!\" after a few seconds he ran to me \"It's locked kick it\" he nodded and kicked the door open and we saw Carly tied to a chair \"Thank God\" she whispered when she saw us we both ran over to her \"Okay. I'm here. I've got you\" Nick told her and started to release her \"Watch my finger. Watch my finger\" Carly said wincing in pain and I saw her finger was missing and that it was bleeding \"Did he do this to you?\" I asked her shocked \"Where is he?\" Carly asked us while Nick grabbed a knife cutting her legs free \"I locked him out\" Nick answered. \"Wait, where's Wade at?\" I asked her Carly shook her head, \"I don't know. He went into the house. This place is a freak show!\" and got out from the chair. We heard a sound of the car starting \"He's leaving\" Nick stated after a few minutes we heard the car leaving. \"He's gone, let's go\" Nick said looking at both of us. We went upstairs but he stopped us and went to the garage after a few minutes he appeared with a wrench \"Alright, the car's by the road Damn it, Dalton's got the keys\". \"Dalton\" he said sounding worried. \"We gotta call the cops\" and ran over to the phone hanging on the wall. He picked it up but dropped it \"Shit! The phone's dead\" putting his hands on his head thinking. He stopped and stood in front of Carly putting his hands on both her shoulders and looked at her in the eyes \"Hey, where's your cell phone?\". \"It might be in the truck up near the house\" Carly answered glancing outside. Nick stopped and went over to the window \"What about Wade? I think he had him too What if he turns him to wax?\" Carly said I looked at her confused Nick also turned back to look at her \"What do you mean, wax?\" I asked her. \"You two don't get it. They're all wax, everyone\" we only looked at her in disbelief \"No, wait\" she froze and opened the door and we followed her confused we reached a house \"There was a woman in here she was alive she pulled back the curtain\" Carly said Nick jumped over the fence and walked up to the window looking threw it suddenly the curtain was pulled back revealing an elderly woman Nick jumped back from shock \"The whole town is rigged\" Carly said after she stepped on the board and looked in the window herself. \"That's impossible\" I said looking at the window and the curtain pulled back again revealing the elderly woman. \"You're saying that that's a real person underneath?\" Nick asked looking at the woman. \"Yes. At the church, they were all like that. At least 20 more\" Carly told us. I was already more then freaked out \"Can we just get the hell out of here?\" I asked scared Nick quickly went over to me calming me down \"Hey well go okay baby\" and grabbed my hand and we started to walk threw town while we were walking Carly told us about Vincent I wasn't really paying much attention. Suddenly Nick ran out from the alley \"Wait!\" I said but he already ran away and started to walk fast \"Nick, what are you doing?\" I asked \"You have to be careful.\" me and Carly following behind him. \"I am being careful\" he answered continuing to walk to the store and tried to open the door but it was locked he went back and lifting the wrench to hit the glass \"No, no, no, no, it'll make too much noise\" I told him grabbing his hand \"Why do you have to be so damn stubborn. He'll find us\". \"Yeah, chances are he will anyway\" Nick said and threw the wrench on the window smashing it. Nick climbed up and grabbed the weapon from the mannequin \"At least with this, he might not want to find us\". Suddenly a gun shot wad heard and the glass door smashed Nick jumped down \"Go Allison, Carly Run!\" and we started running.[Chapter 4] We ran into the cinema to hide and there was this old movie playing and we started to look for a place to hide. Me and Carly were sitting together holding hands, more like clutching each others hand. We saw that he came inside and we sat perfectly still suddenly he stopped and I glanced at him and saw him hitting one of the wax figures then he continued moving down and stopped in front of the screen and stopped to glance but when he reached us I saw him narrowing his eyes and realization reached his eyes recognizing us and lifted his gun ready to shoot I quickly ducked so did Carly \"Nick!\". And right on cue Nick appeared and shot him so we ran towards Nick just as he shot again and ran out from the hall stopping outside the door Carly and I hid behind the ticket counter while Nick waited ready with the bow and arrow and just as Bo stepped outside Nick shot him and he fell with the arrow sticking outside his chest. I stood up and ran over to Nick hugging him in relief he putted a hand on my waist and we slowly walked over to Bo. Nick let me go and dropped the bow picking up the gun checking for ammo \"Empty shells\" he said making them fall on the ground Carly started to walk over to Bo \"Check him for ammo\" Nick told her. She stropped and kicked him to make sure, he didn't move so she bent over and started to check his pockets \"There's nothing in his pockets\" she informs us as she turned to look at us. \"Give me this\" I told Nick and took the gun from him and went over to the other counter and putted it there turning back to them Carly was standing there and Nick was looking at the wax ticked seller \"Nick, let's get out of here\" I said grabbing back his attention and we went out of there. We were walking again \"Is there anybody left alive in this town?\" Nick asked. \"What about this Vincent guy?\" Carly asked too \"Who even knows if there is a Vincent we got to get outta of this place\" Nick answered. We came to a stop a few yard from their house and Nick turned to Carly \"You said you're cell phones in the truck right?\". \"Yeah\" she answered. \"Alright this is what we're gonna do\" Nick began and turned to look at me, now speaking to me \"I'm going to go to the truck, see if I can find Carly's phone and see if I can get help, You go back to the road with Carly Paige and Blake…\" I shook my head cutting him off \"No, no way Nick I'm not leaving you!\". \"Why do you have to be so damn\" he started lifting his voice and I lifted an eyebrow knowing what his was going to say \"stubborn?\" he finished. Nick sighed knowing he lost and glanced at the house than me \"Okay, We stick together and nothing's going to happen to us\" he told me. \"OK\" I answered and he leaned in and gave me a kiss and sighed again putting his forehead against mine \"Come on\" he breathed. We went over to where the car was \"It's under the front seat\" Carly whispered. The car was flipped over \"Nice parking job\" Nick said sarcastically. Carly climbed in the truck to search around for her phone after a few seconds she stood back up \"It's not in there\". And the three of us turned to look at the house \"Wade and Dalton\" Nick said. \"Wade went in there and never came out\" Carly said. \"Alright, We'll go in quick, one pass. If we can't find them, we get the hell out of here\" Nick told us and we nodded understanding. \"Let's try the back\" he finished. Before we stepped inside Carly grabbed a baseball bat. When we got inside Carly went for the phone and I stayed with Nick clutching his hand he whispered Dalton's name and I was glancing around \"Nick, Allison there's guns\" she whispered so we went over to where she was standing. Nick broke the glass and Carly grabbed the net but In vain \"It's bolted to the wall\" I said after looking at it. \"There's got to be a key around her somewhere\" I said and started to look around. When I opened a drawer filled with newspaper clippings I picked up an article with the title \"Siamese Twins Separated\" but putted it back down when I noticed pictures with two little boys, one with some form of a mask on his face I was looking at them and saw one picture were they were conjoined at the head when suddenly someone banged the door open making me jump and drop the photo and I dropped behind the couch and saw Nick and Carly standing at the kitchen and Nick motioned me to move somewhere else with his head and I nodded understanding and I crawled under the pool table the man was obviously Bo and he went to the kitchen and I saw him pull one of the arrows out from his hand screaming in pain I was looking at him when car lights shine through the window so I crawled over to the window and moved the curtain a little to see and when I did I wished I hadn't I saw Paige and Blake at the back of the truck dead and saw a man stepping outside of the truck I crawled backward and hid back under the pool table again and saw Bo walking over in my direction and he stopped in front of the window. \"God dammit\" I heard him curse and walk again and he went over to the door opening it \"Hey, you don't ever leave here without me. You know better than that. Don't be so stupid. What's the matter with you?\" Bo yelled and went back to the kitchen and another man walked inside the house with long black hair that reached his shoulder following Bo. He reached for the arrow \"Don't!\" Bo yelled at him but he did it again \"I said, don't! Get, Get you fucking freak\" he yelled again. And I saw the man lighting a candle. \"Hey, the town's looking real good. We almost finished what mama started. Those two are good. They'll fit perfectly\" I started to look around for Nick or Carly but I couldn't see them but I caught a few more words exchange that made my blood run cold \"Now there's three more, we still got a lot of work to do\". I saw Bo walking again and saw that he noticed the photo on the ground when he did I took my chance when he bent down to pick it to sprint quietly to the hall and moved up the stairs when suddenly someone grabbed me covering my hand making me scream in surprise but the hand muffled my scream \"Sh, she it's me\" I heard Nick's voice as he pulled me to a dark room he grabbed my hand and started to lead me and I saw him going down but stopped halfway when he noticed that I wasn't following \"I saw Paige and Blake's bodies. They're dead\" I managed to say to him. He walked back over to me pulling me to a hug \"We've got to get put of here common hon\" he whispered and pulled back and grabbed my hand and we went down I saw Carly there she obviously heard what I said seeing the tears in her eyes. We were walking when we passed this huge something making a loud noise \"I can't see anything\" Nick said as he stopped looking around at the end of the hallway with no lights on. \"There's gotta be a light here somewhere\" he said when he noticed all the switches and started to mess with them and finally a light turned on so we started to move again when we reached a boiler room that looked weird but I stopped when a saw a figure covered in wax \"Dalton\" Nick said making me tear my eyes from the figure and I realized that the figure was him and my heart dropped. Nick started to walk over to him \"Nick\" Carly said trying to make him stop. Nick came to a stop in front of Dalton and I moved a little to stand behind him next to Carly \"I'll get you out of there\" Nick whispered as he grabbed on to the device that was attached to Dalton's head and started to pull on it, but when he pulled to hard the head snapped right off. \"No, no, Nick!\" I couldn't help it I started to cry and ran over to Nick pulling him from Dalton \"Nick please\". I cried gabbing his jacket as he pulled me to a hug while I was crying and Carly joining our hug. When suddenly Nick pulled away and I saw that man again \"That's Vincent!\" I yelled. Nick ran forward and pushed over a table at Vincent and the table pushed Vincent against the wall, but he bounced back quickly before Nick could make his next move Vincent cut him in the back with one of the knifes and lunged at me I fell over and landed on the ground but before I hit the ground I must've fallen at something cuz the flames were more big and Carly swung the bat at him making him fall over while Nick got up again at started to struggle with him knocking him over and he ran to me \" Come on, Allie! Move it!\" he yelled and pulled me back up and we started running but Nick stopped pulling something making the pot to spill the wax inside it on the floor creating a wall of fire \"Nick, let's get out of here!\" I screamed and we continued to run. We ran upstairs with Nick leading the way and while I was running I saw two chairs with the name's Bo and Vincent on them but they were straps on Bo's chair we continued to run but Nick came to a sudden stop making me ran into him and Carly into me when I followed his gaze I wished I hadn't it was Wade \"No!, Oh, my God Wade\" Carly said from behind me but Nick grabbed my hand making me run again and I grabbed hers just as Nick kicked the door open we saw Bo \"You sick fuck!\" Nick yelled and charged at him but Bo was prepared and made Nick flip over Nick bounced back up and they started to fight just as he pushed Nick at the fake couch Carly hit him with the baseball bat but he punched Carly in the face knocking her out I screamed and jumped at his back and he started to spin and finally knocked me off his back \"You bitch!\" he screamed and came to hit me but Nick ran over and punched him and they started to fight again and there was fire it was melting the wax there was a hole and fire. Bo knocked Nick at the ground \"You're finished\" he said gabbing Nick from his jacked and I looked for anything to hit him with I saw him starting to choke Nick and I remembered the arrow at his chest \"Nick the arrow!\" I screamed and Nick pushed the arrow making Bo scream in pain and Nick gaining control and he started to punch Bo and I saw him pulling put a knife and before I could warn Nick he stabbed him in the leg making Nick scream in pain and Bo pushed Nick making him fall over and I spotted the bat and ran picking it up and hit Bo at the head with it he fell but I continued to hit him blinded by rage \"Allie, behind you!\" Nick screamed and I stopped mid swing and took a few steps back gasping when I saw Vincent I dropped the bat and crawled to Nick supporting him \"Come on, get up please I need you!\" I screamed trying to lift him up making him groan in pain \"Allie\" Nick said making me look at him he stared in my eyes \"Run\". \"No, I'm not leaving you!\" I said shaking my head \"Allie...\" he started again but I cut him off again \"No!, I'm not leaving my baby without his father!\" while looking sternly in his eyes and realization hit his eyes as he glanced at my stomach but before he could answer Vincent's scream grabbed our attention and we both tuned to look at him but he glared at me \"Run! Go Allie! Run!\" Nick screamed pushing me and I ran grabbing back the bat and knocking over the sigh and running up the stairs hearing Nick trying to grab Vincent's attention \"Hey Vincent, Hey!\" obviously it wasn't working cuz I heard him behind me \"I swear to god, if you hurt her!\". I reached the top flair when I turned to look behind me seeing that he was coming up the stairs and I quickly ran up another flight of stairs I reached a room with a bed and shot the door and saw a crib I putted the bat on the bed and grabbed the crib and pushed it against the door just as I did a knife came threw the door almost cutting me making me scream and fall back and I saw that he was cutting the door I managed to stand back up and grabbed the bat slipping over and I saw Vincent came through the door, tossing the crib out of the way \"No. Listen to me. Listen to me!\" I started and held up my hand \"I heard you talking, you don't need to do this you didn't have to listen to your brother I saw Bo's scars and the highchairs!\" but he ran at me and I ran over the bed screaming missing the knife \"You're not a freak! He was! You don't need to do this, please! You're a beautiful artist! Bo was lying to you! He used you! Do you really think that you're mother would have wanted you to do this?\" I finished and I guess that was a stupid thing to say \"Please, don't kill me!\" I screamed as he charged at me and ran out of the door not seeing Nick \"Motherfucker!\" Nick screamed and tackled Vincent They fell onto the bed and started to roll around fighting each other I was at the hall and saw Carly too I guess she woke up \"Allison!\" I heard Nick scream and I quickly got back up slipping a few times and ran on the room to help him with Carly behind me \"I'm here\". I came to a stop and saw the knife sticking put of Nick's leg and locked at him apologetically and pulled the knife from his leg making him scream just as I did Vincent turned to look at me and slashed the knife I screamed but Nick grabbed his hand stopping him before he got the chance \"Do it, Allison! Do it now!\" Nick screamed and I stabbed him at the stomach and pulled back leaving the knife inside him and Nick kicked him to the ground but it gave out crumbling. Before we could do something the ground gave from underneath us and we fell down. I managed to get up so did Carly at this point the wax was melted and it was hard to move I grabbed Nick and pulled him with Carly \"Guys, the wall\" Carly said \"Dig!\". We turned over to the wall and started digging finally creating a hole that you can get thru when we lifted our heads we saw that we dog right where the sigh was and we started to get closer to the ground so we waited to right time to jump and when we reached close enough we jumped out. After we regained our balance we stood up and watched as the wax museum burned. I felt Nick grab my hand and I turned to look at him seeing him looking at me and he pulled me to a hug which I responded. And I felt him put I hand on my belly \"How long?\" he whispered quietly. \"Three and a half month\" I answered looking at the ground avoiding his gaze. I felt his hand under my chin as he lifted my head making me look at him and when I did to my surprise he was smiling with a goofy smile that wormed my heard making me smile too \"I love you, I love both of you\" and leaned in giving me a kiss. We were sitting at the ambulance waiting while there were checking our injuries. \"Hey, that's my friend's camera\" Nick said noticing an officer with Dalton's camera. \"Sorry son, that's evidence\" another police man told him walking over to us \"You guys okay?\" he asked. Is he seriously asking us that when none of us answered \"Well, don't worry. We'll get you to the hospital\" he told us. \"How could no one have known about all this?\" Carly asked him \"Truth is, this town is hard as hell to get to. It's been abandoned 10 years, ever since the sugar mill shut down. Hell, it ain't even on the map anymore. We found all those cars in that old factory. Those Sinclair boys pulled people off the interstate for years. If it wasn't for all that smoke from the fire we wouldn't have even known\" he answered. Another officer came up to him and he walked away. Finally they shot the door and started to drive to the hospital and I was curled up to Nick with his hand wrapped around me suddenly Nick grabbed something from inside his jacket \"Maybe there's some good memories on this\" he said holding out the camera making chuckle \"You took it?\" I asked amused. \"Just felt wrong leaving it behind\" he said looking at me making me smile sadly \"You know?\". I nodded understandingly. \"You okay?\" I asked him and Carly she simply nodded \"We're okay\" Nick answered and kissed me making me sigh leaning me head against his shoulder. I lifted my head as we were outside of town and saw that creepy guy waving at me sitting at the back of his truck with the dog. The End.[Chapter 5] Hey it's me... :) I was thinking about writing a story based on the movie \"the last song\". tell if you want me to write it or any other story. :)[Chapter 6] Hey it's me again any way i started a new story called \"The girl with spark\" it's based on the Hunger Games and it's a Cato love story if your interested. :)[Chapter 7] \"Nick, Dinner's ready!\" I shouted towards the porch door that was opened while putting the plate on the table. After a minute Nick walked in \"Heard ya\" he said teasing me making me smile, And walked thru the door holding Lisa that was giggling like mad and kicking her tiny feet, she was only a few month's old and recently got her first tooth. \"Hey baby\" I said walking over kissing her cheeks and than Nick's lips, she looked a lot like Nick she had my eyes and her Aunt's beautiful hair. After we came Nick and I bought a little house for us and he got a job and Carly moved to New York, we didn't really blame her the memories were still fresh and it was hard knowing that Paige or Blake won't be there to see our little princess Lisa Carly Anderson, and Dalton won't be here to photograph memories with her. Even thought that Carly left we were very close we talked every day and send pictures of little Lisa to her while she send us pictures from N-Y. After Dinner we sat at the living room watching T.V Lisa was laying on top of me while Nick next to me with his hand wrapped around me while I snuggled to his side \"I love you\" Nick whispered kissing my temple making me blush. \"I love you too\" I replayed leaning over to kiss him. He pulls me to his side a little more leaning his head on top of mine kissing it making smile which was something I couldn't stop doing every time he kissed me.

Here's my small contribution. Thanks to C. H.

January Prompt: FAMILY oOo She knew it the first time she awoke to the crackling of magic pervading the air. She came from the silence of death. She came from the darkness of oblivion. And she wasn't alone. When she came into the mortal world, her sister was standing by her side. Crowned by the desperate cries of men, they walked among them as goddesses, shadows in the mist. And while her heart ached for the tortured souls they encountered on their way, her companion seemed to find that very same sight rather enthralling. Head slightly tilted to the side, cold eyes glistening with eagerness, burgundy lips curved in a dangerous grin, and the taste of human suffering bursting inside of her mouth. These fragile mortals... she didn't like their pain for its own sake, she understood it could feed her powers for a long time to come. As long as they were at each other's throats she would be needed, she would be worshipped. But evanescence was going to be their only fate, in the end; the silver-haired sister knew it all along. A throaty laugh erupted from her raven-haired twin's mouth when she heard the truth being spoken. She ran away. And so they went their separate ways. The lady with silver locks tumbling down her pale shoulders went to live to the bottom of the lake, her hair now floating around her head like a glowing halo. Its calm waters became her kingdom, their darkness a cherished reminder of her sister lost. Very few creatures came to call for her help from the shore, preferring to turn to Queen Mab, the lady of the night. But the day came when Mab started to weaken, her great powers slowly flowing out of her body as her followers considered kneeling before a new God. The day came when time actually meant something to her. She was getting close to the brink of oblivion with each passing hour and she knew it. Every mountain, every tree, every little rock on her path seemed to whisper the same threat: \"Soon you'll be forgotten.\" And she couldn't stand it. She grew restless, afraid, desperate even. And she remembered her sister. The Lady of the Lake felt her every step across the mainland, each one sent ripples through the blood inside her veins. When there were no more steps to take, Mab stood silently on the shore, watching the unmoving waters. No need to speak, a pair of sapphire eyes had already emerged to study her. With one swift, graceful jump, the celestial creature whom they belonged to was completely out of the water, floating above it. When she started to speak her small voice came in soft echoes as if it had remained on the bottom of the lake. \"Sister, it's been so long.\" Mab only raised an eyebrow at the veil of sadness in her twin's eyes. \"Not long enough, these mortal fools haven't spent nearly enough time following the old ways.\" Her raspy voice stated coldly. \"And now they think they can just forget us! But I won't let them.\" \"Oh Mab, they are so fickle these mortals... they know no constancy, no stillness. They don't know time can be of no importance, they have so little of it and so they think they have to rush everything, enjoy the many choices life provides before it's too late. You cannot change their nature.\" \"They need us!\" \"They need something to believe in and that's what we gave them, for a while. There are other Gods already being shaped inside of their minds, almost ready to take our place. We need men to exist, they don't necessarily need us.\" \"Then you won't help me bring them back to us?\" Mab seethed. \"I'm sorry, sister. All things change, we must accept that; we must accept our fate.\" \"I won't be drained of my powers, I won't be forgotten!\" \"Then this shall be your fight, Mab, not mine.\" The Lady of the Lake watched her sister walk away with such rage in her grey eyes and clenched fists she knew she was ready to topple empires to get what she wanted. Years went by until the day a man came to her shores, pleading for help. He wasn't any man. He was Mab's creation, a man who had no mortal father . She showed herself to him not to defy her sister, but because she was saddened by the way the lady of the night was playing with his life and the lives of others. He took her advice and left, more than once, and then he came no more. She was fading faster now, not really bothered by the idea of going down into the abyss never to come up again. But she knew her sister was afraid and she only prayed she would come in time. The mist rose and Mab returned with blood on her hands, the blood of many but only one among them truly mattered. She had grown to despise her firstborn after he had turned against her, she had wanted nothing but to tear Merlin apart. But Mordred... Mordred was her rightful son, he had made her so proud. His innate viciousness had made the task of raising him so much easier. And now he was dead, all hope lost for good. In her mind she was still on that battlefield, clutching his body, cradling him in her arms, the tears streaming down her face mingling with the warm blood pouring out of his mortal wound. A man had succeeded in getting under her skin, he had made her mourn his death. Never again. A ghostly-pale outstretched hand came to the surface, its long fingers beckoning, and the Lady of the Lake's echoed words filled the air. \"You went into battle wearing the crown men put above your head, rage and fierceness at your sides. You fought, you lost. Our time's up. Let us face oblivion together, let us go back home. Sweet sister of mine... come to die.\" Mab's bare feet moved of their own accord towards the lake, finding the calmness of its waters undeniably alluring now. The hem of her black dress brushed against the dry land for the last time before she surrendered into her sister's embrace.[Chapter 2] February Prompt: WOMEN oOo The sweet scent of decay haunts the woods she's roaming around. It's almost too sweet, sickening; her nostrils are filled with it. Dead leaves crumble to dust underneath her cold bare feet as she walks, the crunching sound they make is too much of an inadequate weapon to cut through the thick silence; nothing but a blunt sword she quickly discards. Where is it she's headed? She cannot remember, it seems. She just walks. And the trees on her path all look the same, their branches of ink intertwining high above her head in the clear night sky. She has never spent much time wandering into the woods, her father wouldn't allow that when she was younger. It's not ladylike, Nimue ; that's what he'd often say in response to her requests. A few simple words, words he was supposed to use with her, words she grew to hate. But not him, never him. She loved her father, he just worried about her, about her future. And maybe he was right. She almost died the first time she disobeyed him and went straying from the beaten path, both literally and figuratively speaking. But she met Merlin where death stood waiting with wide open arms and he saved her. Merlin... she loves the way he always talks about the woods he grew up into, the remarkable connection he feels with the forces of nature and every living thing. Now that's a gift. And what a curse... Beware the woods when all its dwellers go silent. The warning runs through her mind, spoken in the kind familiar voice of the man she loves. She turns around, looking for him in the shadows, only to find out she's alone. The realization sends shivers down her spine and she instinctively hugs herself. Cold hands meet just as cold naked shoulders, she lowers her gaze to see goosebumps all over her forearms. That's when she sees the white of her nightgown and realizes that's the only thing she's wearing. No wonder she's freezing. She runs her hands up and down her arms, in a desperate effort to keep herself warm. But her numb fingertips soon stop dead in their tracks; something glistening in the moonlight has caught her eye. Water. Nimue stands a few feet away, paralyzed by fear. Water's just another thing she has grown to dread after she got her scars, like mirrors. She doesn't want to see her reflection. All sorts of reflective surfaces have been banished from her room; she can barely stand when others look upon the stranger's face she carefully keeps wrapped up in a scarf, she dies a little everytime Merlin starts to peel it away from her marred skin. She feels so undeserving of his time, of his patience, of his love. A sudden caw from the trees pulls her from her thoughts, making her flinch. Her head whips to the side and she lays her fearful eyes on the branch occupied by the source of that very same eerie noise. There stands a most uncommon raven, staring at her. It has a striking beauty about itself, the way its dark shiny feathers catch the pale light of the moon, the way its tiny black orbs twinkle at every twitch of the head. Nimue's next breath gets caught in her throat as her eyes fall on the bird's claws. Unconsciously, she moves backwards, towards the pool. When she turns around again she sees something shift in the darkness at its bottom. A dim light is born out of the shadows swirling in the water, a light that gets brighter until Nimue can make out the three faces carved in the stone floor. She has never seen this place before but it looks familiar and now she knows why. Merlin has been here once, he told her the story. He described these very same stone faces, she can even name them. Titania the Maiden, the one facing left; her every feature speaks of innocence. Mab-Morrigan the Warrior, her empty eyes gazing straight into Nimue's; her painted face bears the marks of a fierceness transcending the mortal realm. Melusine the Mother, the third and last figure, facing right; the purest and most powerful form of love is known to pulse within her stone heart. All three of them are supposed to portray the different personalities of Mab, Queen of the Old Ways and Merlin's sworn enemy. Nimues wonders if each of them can be found in every mortal woman as well. Yes, she thinks so. But what am I? She thinks to herself, her eyes glistening in the silver light reflected by the water's surface. Am I a maiden? No more. Am I a warrior? I never was. Am I mother? I never will be. And what's a woman who cannot be a mother and a warrior forged to fight for her family? What can I offer Merlin? I am nothing. \"I can fix that, dear.\" Nimue's eyes widen as Mab's raspy voice suddenly invades her mind like poison fumes. \"I can give you what you want.\" The goddess' words sound hoarse, croaky, but they hold the power to bare Nimue's invisible wounds, spreading a sorceress' balm over them. Her caresses make Nimue's skin crawl, and yet she's unable to pull away and free herself. \"Can you picture it, Nimue? Making Merlin happy... getting your beauty back... bearing his child.\" This is almost too much. \"I can make it all happen. You know I can.\" Nimue squeezes her eyes shut, hands balled into white-knuckled fists at her sides; she tries to focus on keeping the demon woman out of her head, only to find confirmation of the fact that she's no match for her. Don't trust the Queen of Lies and Deceit. There's a catch. There's always a catch. Merlin's reassuring voice comes to her. \"There's no catch, Nimue. Merlin's my son, I only want what's best for him.\" Lies! Merlin's accusation booms through her mind. I know, my love. I won't fall for them. Nimue mentally reassures him. \"You just want to keep him for yourself.\" Nimue addresses the crow. \"You'll never let me have him.\" The raven's answer to that is a piercing cawing that forces her to bring her hands up to cover her ears. When the cries stop, at last, Nimue, now standing beside the pool, crouches down by the silvery surface. The knots keeping the scarf tightly in place around her head and neck have come undone, she can now see the piece of cloth dangling in the wind out of the corner of her eye. Her old self stares back at her from the water's surface. She can still feel the dull pain of her ugly scars pulsing underneath the skin but on the outside... they're gone. Just like that. Her flawless face is back. Nimue's fingertips fly to her face, eager to probe her own skin, but they stop painfully close to their wish becoming true. It's just an illusion , she tries to remind herself, just another one of Mab's well-crafted tricks. \"You see what my magic can do for you, Nimue.\" Each word is coated in hypnotic sweetness. Oh Mab, why are you being so cruel? Why do you hate me so? Nimue's fingertips sink into the smooth skin as she lets out the breath she was holding and allows her body to be taken over by the sobs. Merlin's warm eyes appear on the silvery surface. There's no more love for her in the ghastly irises she meets, only disappointment and disgust for her weakness. She cannot stand it. She looks away. \"No!\" She screams. \"My answer's no.\" She can't stop the tears from falling. Mab's eerie cackle fills the air around her and suddenly she knows the scars are back, even without the need to see them with her own eyes. \"You know where to find me when you'll change your mind, Nimue. I will wait for you in your dreams.\" And Nimue knows the missing words Mab didn't need to add: until you'll give in to me, at last. A promise. And a threat. Safe in her bed at Avalon, bathed in the golden warmth of morning light, Nimue wakes up with a soft fluttering of eyelashes. AN: Just wanted to say I'm falling in love with James Mallory's novelization of the miniseries, I know I'm very late to the party but better late than never, right? :D As always, sorry for my mistakes.[Chapter 3] AN: I wrote these few simple lines a while ago while listening to \"Sane\" by Fear of Men. I imagined these to be Ambrosia's last thoughts while she's in her hut with Mab (pretending for a moment that Merlin's out of the picture). March Prompt: FAITH oOo Pounding, racing, shuddering; There's life underneath this frail skin of mine. She craves my beating heart. Her fingertips seek out the heated flesh. Greedily, they seize every inch they can reach, running blindly after the pulse. Fresh bruises banish the paleness with their shades. I own you , a ghastly whisper against my neck. How can I call the darkness a liar when I'm wearing her marks? A frozen kiss lingering in the hollow of my throat. And the firmness gives in, failing to preserve the shape of my body. And her fingers sink in deep, molding me into a creature of her own design. Warm blood still runs under paper-thin skin, unaware of the curse it casts on me. A life that's poorly sheltered, cloaked in nothing but weakness. A heart that fancies itself safe in a cage of brittle bones keeps beating in my chest. But I know I am not safe. Are you going to run from me? She smiles against the dark. Then run, my darling. Run. She's with me wherever I go. I fed off lies that I took right from her open hands, one by one. She taught me to be afraid, to fear the Gods that play with our lives. She taught me to believe and now I do. I believe. I believe she will destroy me in the end.

Everything was fine, until he heard the front door slam open. It was none other than Georgette. However, Oliver noticed that things were off. Aside from being drenched from the rain, she wasn't one bit pompus and more depressed. She also had a black eye. \"So...is everything alright Georgette?\" Oliver asked, a bit concerned. \"If it wasn't obvious, THINGS WERE AN ABSOULUTE DISASTER!\" she screamed, heavily gushing tears and plopping down in front of him. Oliver tried to comfort her by rubbing up against her. \"Just tell me what happened. You'll feel better if you let it off your chest.\" \"You wouldn't understand.\" she sobbed. \"C'mon.\" After a brief silence, she relented. \"Alright, but don't blame me if you get mad enough to kick something.\" Oliver looked confused for a second, before resuming focus. \"I was going to go on a date with Tito, and at first, everything seemed fine. I strutted up to his home and went to his doghouse to ask him and... let's just say that Tito made fun of me fo-\" She was interrupted by a shatter, coming from an angered Oliver kicking a glass off a table. \"Whoops, I lost it there. Anyways, he made fun of you!?\" \"Yes! As soon as he saw my style, he instantly started making fun of me and said I wasn't worthy of him. Then, he whapped me across the face...and then it started raining!\" she whined. \"Wha-what style did you use?\" Oliver asked. \"One moment please.\" She went upstairs to dry up and then do herself up like she was before coming home. ===A FEW MINUTES LATER=== \"Well, Oliver. What do you think?\" She appeared in front of the kitten with her fluff bundled up like a cloud and two magenta bows in it. She was wincing, unsure of what he has to say.

Georgette didn't respond, choosing to snuggle him tighter. \"Hey, Earth to Georgette!\" he hollered, waving a paw in front of her face. \"You know, you really are a sweetheart.\" she told him with all her heart. \"It's folks like you who need to be on this planet more often.\" Oliver couldn't help but shed happy tears at this. \"Thank you so much! Likewise to you!\" She then allowed him to climb onto her back. As soon as he got on there, he starts kneading her fur with his claws, causing her to react each time, until he lies down and falls asleep.

The hustle and bustle of the city seemed muted and distant. The noise that was New York City reached his ears slowly – they twitched once or twice but otherwise he didn't react. He could barely feel the heat of the sun warming his dirty fur. He kept his eyes shut because the light was too bright for him. Or maybe he'd been sleeping. It was hard to remember now. He was tired. Exhausted in too many ways to count and truth be told, he simply didn't care much about anything anymore. He wasn't sure how long ago it'd been since he'd hit the streets but supposed in the end that it didn't really matter. Even if he'd had any type of street smarts to make it on his own, he didn't really want to. He couldn't bring himself to care. Everything was gone. His happy, peaceful life had been shot to pieces so, so quickly and it was never coming back. She was never coming back. It hurt to breathe. To think, even. It was easier not to try…. He could hear the sound of rats scampering along the walls of the alley he'd tucked himself into however long ago. It felt like a lifetime. Time wasn't a concept he followed anymore but he knew that they'd been venturing closer to him recently – they were cautious, naturally. He wasn't dead yet. But their hunger was getting the better of them. They were nothing if not persistent. He'd never liked rats – had been more then happy to kill the few that came into the house so long ago. They didn't belong there and they paid for it with their lives. It was almost funny how the roles had changed now…. He smelled the disgusting, mangy rodent in front of him before he heard it but couldn't quite muster up the energy to open his eyes. Instead, he instinctively let his ears fall back and hissed weakly, a low growl in the back of his throat. The rat backed away quickly. It didn't go very far though. It waited patiently. And a few minutes later, it was back – this time with others – and he felt the weight of them on his body seconds before he felt several sharp, stabbing pains across his body. A weak mewl escaped him and he shifted weakly, a pathetic attempt to toss them off. He felt their tiny claws latch onto his fur and felt their teeth rip into him again... and again…. His whines of pain went unnoticed and he breathed laboriously, feeling weak and sick and so, so tired. He barely registered when the rats froze on top of him, the chittering of their teeth stopping as they recognized a new threat that certainly wasn't him. If he had strength to react, the deep, angry growl that suddenly reverberated through the alley would have raised his hackles high. Instead, he was merely grateful that the biting pain had stopped for a moment. \" Ours! Ours! Ours!\" The rats squeaked angrily, even as they began to beat a hasty retreat, climbing over crates and trash as whatever had frightened them approached quickly. He felt a brush of air pass by him, heard one rat squeak loudly in pain, and listened as something shook it – hard – before just as quickly dropping it to the floor. The scent of fresh blood filled the air. \"Anyone else?\" A low, angry voice asked. The sound of tiny feet scampering quickly to find safety was the only response. \"Didn't think so.\" He sensed the newcomers attention quickly focus on him and tensed weakly as it approached him slowly. He waited for teeth to tear into him again and was faintly surprised when nothing of the sort happened. Instead, he felt a nudge as something gently prodded his side. \"Kid?\" Another nudge and this time he mewled weakly in response, just wanting it all to stop . \"Oliver?\" The voice asked quietly. There was fear in that one word. \"Answer me, kid. Get up!\" The voice barked at him, nudging him harder this time, demanding his attention. Oliver . It took him several moments to recognize that that was his name and another to realize what that meant. He felt a pang of something in his heart and suddenly it became important to answer that voice. He shifted slightly in response, trying to find the strength to open his eyes. \"That's it, come on.\" He was prodded again by a wet nose. \"You can do it, kid.\" \"D…dodger?\" He whispered, blinkering blearily upwards and seeing nothing but a somewhat familiar dark shape standing protectively above him, blocking everything else. \"The one and only.\" Dodger responded quickly, relief in his voice. How long had it been since they'd seen each other? A few years? It felt forever ago… on Jenny's birthday. \"…huh…\" He felt his eyes start to slip shut again, a strange but welcome peace coming over him at the thought that he wasn't completely alone anymore. They opened just as fast as Dodger prodded his side again, harder this time. \"Don't do that, kid. Stay awake!\" He snapped, sounding agitated. \"…tired…\" \" Tough .\" Dodger practically snarled. \"I'm not just gonna watch you lay down and die – you can sleep when I say you can, you got it?\" Dying was so much easier though. He wanted it – longed for it – anything to escape the empty, pitiful, lonely void that had become his life. Jenny was gone and once again, in a cruel twist of fate, he was a stray and no one wanted him. Except… maybe that wasn't true. \"Did you hear me?\" Dodger demanded. He blinked slowly and looked up at his old friend again, breathing heavily. He wondered briefly where Dodger had even come from. \"…y-yeah… I, I heard you….\" \"Good.\" Dodger responded shortly, glancing up at the sky and at the dingy alley around them. \"Can you walk?\" It took him a minute to register the question and then for the first time in what felt like a long time, he gave moving his best shot. Pain flared up all over his body and with unwelcome clarity, he realized how sore and achy he really was. His limbs trembled as he tried to get them underneath him. The effort exhausted him and he laid back down, panting and tired. \"Can't.\" He said regretfully, meaning it because this was Dodger and he never liked disappointing him. His eyes slipped closed again without his permission. Dodger didn't respond but a minute later, his warm, comforting weight pressed against him a moment later as he laid down. Dodger's long, warm tongue began running the length of his exhausted body, the pressure soothing and gentle. The sensation of slowly being cleaned was a luxury he hadn't expected to experience ever again. He had taken great pride in his appearance before his life had been turned upside down and afterwards, he hadn't cared that much. His fur was matted and dirty and he was probably more brown then orange nowadays. He might even have fleas. Jenny's mom would have been horrified, he thought to himself. Dodger was fixing it though. Calmly, patiently, kindly cleaning him up and erasing the evidence of the reality of the last couple of months and it felt so, so good. It took him a few minutes of comforting bliss to realize he was purring, a rusty, gravelly purr that he hadn't used in a long time. He squinted, pulling back into Dodger's side slightly when his tongue started licking his face. Dog breath was disgusting, hot and smelly, and however much he liked Dodger, his wasn't the exception. He wanted him to stay though, so he said nothing and continued to purr low in his throat. It was much easier then talking. Dodger seemed to understand. He didn't realize that he had fallen asleep until he was being woken up again sometime later. His eyes blinked open and it was darker then it had been earlier. It took them a few seconds to adjust and when they did, he saw that he was still in the alley. \"Hey, kid?\" Dodger spoke quietly, his voice low and comforting. He felt himself purr quietly in response. \"I'm going to get you out of here, alright?\" Dodger continued, shifting slightly. \"Not that I don't like the accommodations but uh… New York has got better ones and I'd rather not spend the night in the rain.\" Rain wasn't fun and if it rained, he'd get all wet and dirty again. It reminded him vaguely of when he'd been a kitten and he'd almost drowned in a thunderstorm. No, he really didn't like rain. \"I… can't walk.\" He said softly, regretfully, turning his head to look up at Dodger. \"It hurts.\" Dodger had always been confident – proud and untouchable. But even smart as he was, he was still kind and had taken Oliver under his wing and protected him. They'd become family – brothers – all those years ago. The feeling was still there. Dodger still looked good – he even still had his red bandana, a little more tattered with age, but still the same one. He seemed more worn out though - sad and worried and a little thinner then before. \"I know.\" He said simply. \"You're bigger then you used to be but you obviously haven't been eating much so I think I can still carry you. I got a place only a few blocks from here.\" Oliver paused, trying to remember where they were but coming up with nothing. He'd wandered for a long time, without direction or meaning. \"F-fagan's?\" Dodger looked away for a moment. \"No – he's gone. So are the others.\" \"…oh.\" He wished he could say more – offer some kind of comfort but he simply didn't have the energy. That his old gang could be gone had never occurred to him – he assumed that they'd simply always be there. A constant, somehow. Untouchable. Like Jenny had been until she wasn't. The realization that Dodger had experienced loss as well, hurt. A lot. He wished he had known… maybe he could have been there to help. That's what friends were supposed to do. He wondered when it happened and how and what his friend had done when no one was left and Oliver should have known somehow – because Dodger had known about him, right? He was here now, had found him and Oliver hadn't done the same and His thoughts were interrupted when Dodger stood up. He felt the cool air where Dodger's body had kept him warm and shivered at the chill that came over him. \"Hey - don't worry about it, alright?\" Dodger said softly, gentle understanding in his eyes as he lowered his head and licked his face again. \"You just worry about you, right now. That's what important.\" He said, moving around to stand over him. \"Let's get you out of here.\" Dodger's teeth gripped the scruff of his neck firmly, lifting him gently, and then they off, leaving the dingy alley behind them. He was still tired – they both were, it seemed. But they weren't alone, anymore. He didn't know what Dodger had been up to the past few years, didn't know how he'd come to find him or what was going to happen in the future… but they had decided to be family years ago. And family stuck together. They looked out for each other. Helped each other. Dodger had saved him before. Maybe they could save each other now. Maybe they'd be okay. \"Deep affliction has only made them stronger; it ought, I think, for it should refine our nature.\" -Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist A/N angsty, right? at least it had a bit of a hopeful ending though! the boys will be okay if they have each other. please leave a review! they make me happy! :) DragonflyonBreak ","Summary":" A/N i was on youtube. watching clips of Oliver and Company because it's not on Netflix (rude) and t"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Georgette The Moocher","Author":"MysteriousMose","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12824515","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Georgette walked with her head high, her legs trotting with perfect form as she strolled through Central Park. The Poodle flashed her pearly teeth in a smile as she passed by a Doberman she recognized from one of her competitions. It grew wider as she saw him blush. The purebred shot him a coquettish wink and watched him swoon before he was yanked along by his human. Georgette tittered to herself as she strode on ahead. Another admirer to add to her collection and shower her with the adoration she loved. She'd have to get his name some time. The Poodle hummed to herself as she sauntered along the little winding path, Winston trudging along behind her with a loose grip on her designer leash. It was, she decided, a beautiful day for a stroll. And judging by the number of humans and dogs who'd shown up at the park today, she wasn't alone in her verdict. The show dog watched as they clambered all over the cleanly cut turf, chasing one another or retrieving sticks or balls. Georgette rolled her eyes at the scene. The game of fetch had never appealed to her. If humans wanted the stick so badly they shouldn't have thrown it away in the first place. \"Alright, Georgette…Let's rest for a moment, shall we?\" The Poodle looked over her shoulder as her caretaker slowed down and approached a comfortable looking bench on the side of the path. She complied and followed him, letting out a sigh. Though he was shirking his duty and neglecting her of the exercise she needed to maintain her perfect figure, Georgette supposed she could forgive him. Winston was only human after all; he was entitled to a bit of rest now and then. It was hard work looking after a purebred, especially since he had Jenny and Oliver to mind on top of that. Georgette settled down with graceful poise beside the bench as Winston reclined and let out a sigh of relief. The Poodle busied herself with thinking of what she would do upon returning home. There was the usual coat touch up, a light manicure, perhaps a short bath to rinse the dirt from her paws. If there was any time left after that, she might indulge Jenny a bit and spend a few minutes with Oliver. The girl had been pushing the two to 'play' together. Georgette sniffed at the thought. She would do no such thing. But she supposed it wouldn't hurt to let the cat speak to her. He was a sweet kid, though she would never admit it. \"Georgette? Georgette, is that you, darling?\" The Poodle looked over to see a tall Afghan hound trotting towards her, her pale blonde coat sweeping beneath her. Beside her came a Cocker Spaniel with a shining golden coat. Georgette smiled and stood up as they approached. \"Giselle! Yvonne! How wonderful to see you,\" the Poodle let out a chuckle, \"Is there another show in town no one told me about?\" The Afghan gave a little grin. \"I'm afraid not, darling,\" she said through her teeth, \"Though I must say you look ready for one.\" \"Oh, stop it,\" Georgette giggled, \"You know this is how I always look.\" \"And a very nice look it is,\" added the Spaniel, \"You should really teach us your grooming techniques.\" \"I'm afraid they're strictly Poodle only,\" replied Georgette as she caressed the neatly trimmed fur on her chest, \"Besides, you two do a wonderful job with your own coats. Sometimes I'd love to have long, silky fur like that.\" She really didn't, but Georgette thought it would be good taste to humor them. \"So, what have you two been up to lately?\" \"Oh, nothing much,\" answered Yvonne, \"The Mister and Missus are putting on another costume party next Friday and you know what that means.\" \"You'll be reprising your role as Lady Macbark?\" Georgette guessed with a grin. \"Exactly,\" sighed Yvonne, \"It's not that I mind the costume, I just really think I make a better Miranda.\" \"I'm sure you'll do well no matter who you go as,\" Georgette said as she turned to Giselle, \"And what about you?\" \"Well,\" said Giselle as she tossed her long fur over her shoulder, \"My humans are buying a summer home in Connecticut. I believe it's a beach house, from what they've been talking about.\" Georgette smiled and nodded sympathetically. \"Ah, so you'll be spending more time with your housekeeper? What was his name again?\" \"Jervis,\" said Giselle, \"And that won't exactly be the case. I'll be staying with them.\" Georgette paused and looked genuinely surprised. \"Oh,\" murmured the Poodle, as she donned a plastered-on smile, \"How wonderful.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" Giselle went on, \"It will be so nice to get away from all the noise and congestion of the city.\" She gave Georgette a syrupy smirk, \"And the best part is that the beach is private.\" \"I see,\" sang the Poodle as her eyes narrowed just a tiny bit, \"It sounds delightful.\" Georgette's smile hid the increasingly bitter taste in her mouth and soul. She couldn't possibly be jealous. The Foxworths' had two beach homes, so clearly they were better than Giselle's humans. But what irked her was that they had never taken her to one. They'd taken Jenny on vacation before. Sometimes she even went with them on their little trips to other countries. The only time they took their Champion Show Dog anywhere was when it was for a competition. \"Georgette, is something wrong?\" The Poodle blinked and looked over to Yvonne, smiling warmly. \"Oh, nothing at all,\" she said, \"I'm just a little tired. I have jetlag.\" Both Giselle and Yvonne raised their eyebrows. \"Jetlag?\" echoed Giselle. Georgette nodded smugly and tipped her muzzle in the air. \"Of course,\" said she said, \"I just returned from Italy last night. My humans had important business to take care of at an embassy. But it wrapped up quickly, so we spent the next few days touring the Canals of Venice.\" The Poodle couldn't help but smile at the way her friends' jaws dropped open. She could even see a little glimmer of envy in Giselle's eyes. \"Hey! Georgette! Heya Baby!\" Georgette froze in place, her eyes going wide, mouth open in a mortified gasp. She knew all too well just who that shrill voice belonged to. She slowly turned to see a little rat-like shape scurrying toward her from across the clearing. To her horror both Giselle and Yvonne had turned their heads at the source of the noise, and gazed at the peculiar little creature with bemusement. The Poodle would have given anything to be anywhere else at that moment. She bared her teeth in a wide-eyed grimace as Tito rushed between Giselle and Yvonne, stopping right in front of her and giving her a grin. The little red tuft of hair on his head was askew, his coat was darkened with dirt, and his legs were grass stained. \"Hey baby, it's great to see ya again!\" he cried as he jumped up and stole a kiss, leaving a noticeable nose-print on the side of Georgette's muzzle. \"Georgette…do you know this…fellow?\" The Poodle looked up to see that the confusion on Giselle's face had turned into amusement. The Afghan shot her a sly little smirk. \"I certainly do not!\" Georgette answered hotly, her face reddening under the sardonic leers of her fellow show dogs. \"'Course ya do, my little croissant,\" Tito laughed, \"Don'tcha remember the good times we had? The kidnapping? The rescue? I saved your life and taught you to dance!\" \"Wait a moment,\" said Yvonne as her eyes widened in thought, \"You mean that all actually happened?\" The Spaniel looked at the despairing Georgette, \"I'd heard stories that you'd joined a pack of feral mongrels to save your human, but I'd assumed they were merely slander.\" \"They are!\" barked the Poodle, \"That's all they are!\" \"C'mon baby, don't be modest,\" said Tito as he jumped about, \"You dove right in with us.\" He boxed his forelegs in the air, \"We kicked gangster butt all night! We couldn't have done it without you!\" \"We did not!\" snarled Georgette, \"It never happened! I've never seen you before in my life, and—\" \"Hey guys, I found him!\" Georgette's jaw dropped as she looked up and saw a Terrier mutt with a red handkerchief tied around his neck. The newcomer flashed a smile and strolled over to her. \"Well, if it ain't Six Times National Champion,\" he chuckled, \"Been a while. How's the kid?\" His eyes lit up as they wandered over to Giselle and Yvonne. He smirked and took a step toward them. \"And uh, who're your friends?\" Georgette was at a loss for words. Unfortunately, Giselle still had plenty. \"Oh, forgive us,\" the Afghan said with a smile that reeked of insincerity, \"I am Giselle, and this is Yvonne.\" \"It's a pleasure to meet you,\" added Yvonne. \"Well hey, the pleasure's all mine,\" Dodger said with a flick of his ears, \"I take it you're both show dogs like Champ over here?\" Georgette watched in horror as the Terrier flirted with the pair, even as the rest of his gang showed up. \"Hey Georgie, honey,\" called a Saluki mix as she drew near, \"How's it been?\" She was flanked by a towering Great Dane and a heavyset Bulldog. \"Good afternoon, Ms. Georgette,\" Francis said with a nod. \"Hi!\" cried Einstein as he galloped over to Dodger and smiled at the two purebreds. Georgette clenched her teeth together and felt her fur bristle on end. She looked at Winston, hoping he was rested up so that they could continue on and leave the mess behind. To her dismay the old man had dozed off, his face resting skyward as he softly snored. The Poodle felt sick to her stomach. This was the end of her, she was sure of it. From the mocking glances Giselle and Yvonne shot her she was certain they were going to tell everyone about her unfortunate acquaintances. She'd be disgraced, exiled, a social leper that was no better than the street mongrels she associated with. It was more than she could bear. \"So uh, baby, want me to come over tonight and show ya a little more dancin'?\" Georgette looked down at the Chihuahua. Her eyes began to glower, her lips lifting to reveal a venomous sneer of perfect white teeth. \"Uh…baby?\" \"You little bug-eyed creep!\" snarled the poodle, \"You've ruined me!\" Tito leaped back from her jaws, staring at her in bewilderment. \"What are ya talkin'-\" \"Why couldn't you just stay away?\" snapped the show dog, \"I don't know what I was thinking when I thought I—\" she paused and retched in repulsion, \" Liked you! Showing up was bad enough, but you brought all of your little sub-canine, garbage eating, parasite-ridden street trash friends along with you and destroy a reputation I've worked years to maintain in a matter of seconds!\" She sucked in huge angry breaths through her flaring nostrils, staring down at the shivering little dog with a gimlet-eyed glare. \"B-but baby-\" \"Don't speak to me!\" she spat, \"Don't ever speak to me again!\" She looked up to see all of Dodger's crew staring at her in shock. \"That goes for all of you!\" Georgette turned around and clamped her jaws on the designer leash attached to her collar, giving it a sharp yank. She had been intending to free herself from Winston's grip, which she did. But she hadn't intended the leash to whip back quite so fast, cracking her in the side of the head and sending her stumbling to her side. She fought back humiliated tears as she heard Giselle and Yvonne chortling behind her, rose to her paws, and ran off. \"Lousy mutts,\" grumbled Georgette as she stormed through the gates, leaving the park and entering the city, \"Unwashed halfwits. Think they can just waltz up to me any old time they want? Ugh, the nerve of some dogs! If they can even be called that.\" The poodle glanced right and left, and the seething rage that had dominated her thoughts subsided a little. She'd been intent on going home and wallowing in self pity, but now that she came to the gates…she wasn't sure which way the Foxworth home was. The Poodle glanced up at the ironwork over her head. Was this even the right gate? Georgette nervously chewed her lip and looked out over the sprawl of city before her. The constant barrage of traffic honked and rumbled angrily, leaving a constant cloud of foul-smelling fumes that irritated her nose. The Poodle sneered in disgust, certain that the smog would stain her fur if she remained there much longer. The show dog murmured to herself as she waited for an opening to appear in the river of painted metal and black rubber. She'd seen Dodger and his gang cross the streets a few times, and if those mutts could do it, then a champion purebred certainly could. At last, the opportunity came. Georgette drew a deep breath, regretted it, coughed, and then made a mad dash for the other side of the street. Almost immediately a taxi's horn was shrieking into her ears. The Poodle let out a startled yelp and froze as her brain was assaulted by sounds and sights she'd never experienced before. More horns blared, brakes screeched, tires squealed, headlights blazed into her eyes and the pavement trembled beneath her. A car rushed past and almost took off the tip of her nose. Another nearly got her tail. Georgette stumbled blindly among the congestion she'd caused, panic coursing through every inch of her being. All the while the humans hurled insults from their vehicles. \"Worthless mutt!\" \"Stupid dog!\" \"Move it, you brainless cur!\" \"Outta the way, bonebag!\" Georgette let out a terrified howl and awkwardly scrambled wherever she could find room. Her nose drowned in a storm of gaseous smoke exhaled by rusting mufflers, her ears lost in a swarm of angrily droning engines, and her eyes blanched by the shine of a million headlights. It seemed that no matter which way she turned she was always staring down the scowling grill of a car. The Poodle screamed and fled, zigzagging, turning sharp angles around station wagons and dashing beneath trailers until she crashed headlong into a brick wall. Georgette lay curled up on the sidewalk in a daze, her eyes stretched wide open, her whole body shaking. She remained there for quite some time, too terrified to even think of moving. It was only when she felt the first raindrop splash against her temple a thought even went through her head. \"…It's raining…\" she muttered. The show dog slowly blinked and looked upwards. The city's spires were set against a darkening sky that was growing cloudier by the minute. Georgette gulped as another raindrop landed on her nose, the icy droplet sending a shiver from her muzzle to her tail. She rose unsteadily to her paws and looked around. The street was filled with a steady stream of traffic still sorting itself out from her escapade. Her fur stood on end at the thought of traversing the roadway again. The Poodle turned her attention to her side of the street. Tall dark buildings stood uninvitingly to her right and before her stretched a trash-strewn sidewalk that stretched on forever. A frown stung her face as she found she didn't see anything familiar about it. \"Alright,\" she murmured under her breath, \"No problem. I just need to keep looking until I do find something familiar.\" She put on an insincere smile and began strolling down the gritty sidewalk. She felt a few more drops of rain land on her shoulder and run down her foreleg. The show dog gulped, quickening her pace a little. Grim-faced humans passed her by without giving her a second glance. Several them were popping open their umbrellas as the rain began to fall harder. Others adjusted their hats and rolled up their jacket collars. Neither of these struck Georgette as a good thing. A sudden thunderclap drew an impressive jump from the purebred. The storm began the moment her paws touched down on the pavement, opening up in a torrential cloudburst that descended on the city like an invading horde. Georgette felt as if someone had dumped a bucket of ice water on her as it hit, yelping in misery as she was soaked from head to toe. \"Winston!\" she sputtered by reflex, \"Winston! Help!\" A whole new level of horror suddenly struck the Poodle. Winston wasn't coming. Winston didn't even know where she was. She'd known this at the time she'd stormed off, but she'd intended to be back home by now. But things hadn't quite gone as she'd hoped, and she was neither at home, or in the park, where Winston would be looking for her. That is, if he was even searching for her out in this weather. A chill ran up her spine, and it wasn't caused by the rain. Georgette crouched back against the granite blocks of a department store, a whimper building up in the back of her throat. She looked up again at the humans as they strode past her, their hurried steps splashing cold water on her paws. Her eyes shimmered pleadingly as the rain pelted her brow. The show dog whimpered softly as another crack of thunder shook the city and echoed through the alleyways. Yet not a single human would acknowledge her. Why were they ignoring her? She'd won more awards than any dog she knew. She'd been on magazine covers. Her humans were one of the richest families in New York. Surely there had to be someone who recognized her among all these people. \"Excuse me,\" the Poodle called out to no one in particular, \"Excuse me! I am Georgette, resident of the Foxworth House and Six Time National Champion. You may have seen me in TIME magazine, where I was named Top Dog of the Year. I really need to get home, and would appreciate it if someone could-\" \"Shaddup!\" Georgette yelped as a great black boot collided with her ribs, sending her sprawling out onto the concrete. She gulped as its owner thudded past and nearly stepped on her muzzle. The purebred slowly sat up again, tenderly rubbing her paw where she'd been struck as she glared after the lumbering brute who'd dared to assault her. Clearly he couldn't recognize champion material when he saw it. Didn't he see how perfectly she was groomed? Her grace and poise? Her glittering collar? Her designer leash? The Poodle absent-mindedly grasped at her collar as she thought, giving it a quick dusting to dry it off. As she brushed the gold-plated piece she happened to notice something that made her heart stop for a moment. Her eyes went wide, her mouth opened in a distraught wail as her ears drooped limply. Something was terribly wrong with her designer leash. It wasn't there. Georgette moaned piteously. Her humans had spent good money on the leash. Of course they would forgive her for losing it and undoubtedly replace it, but the fact that she was now without a leash that befitted her perfection was an utter travesty. The purebred looked out in the street with gloomy eyes. She must have lost it in her mad dash through traffic. She sobbed again, wishing she were home, wishing that she had her leash, and wishing that her reputation wasn't so totally destroyed. \"Rough day?\" Georgette looked up, hopeful a human had spotted her. She saw nothing but the uninterested faces of pedestrians looking to get out of the rain. \"Down here.\" Now that she heard it again, Georgette wasn't so sure the voice was human. It was a deep, guttural sound; a rich drawl with a raspy edge. The Poodle looked down as instructed. All she saw was a rusty grate off the edge of the sidewalk. Two rushing streams of rainwater lay on either side of it, disappearing into the darkness below in a chorus of splashes and gurgles. Her lips pursed in disgust. Clearly it was a drain to some cesspool beneath the road. One that was probably filled with all sorts of disgusting garbage and the diseased vermin that fed on it. \"You're not a rat, are you?\" she muttered, \"I don't associate with rats.\" \"Far from it,\" the voice chuckled, \"Probably further from it than you are.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" the Poodle growled indignantly, daring to take a step closer to the grate. She squinted at the shadows to see if she could spot the voice's owner. Georgette's sneer lessened some as she saw two large, widely set eyes stared up at her. They seemed to glow a pale red in the shade of the drain. \"Don't mean anythin',\" the voice replied, \"'Cept my heritage don't skirt into the rodent family.\" Georgette could hear a grin in the creature's words, and wasn't sure if she liked it. \"Who are you?\" \"Someone who understands your situation,\" answered the voice, \"A lost pet. Or in my case, unwanted. Wasn't easy gettin' over the shock, but I managed well enough. I'm sure ya will too, eventually. Seen plenty of other lost dogs make it out here.\" \"Excuse me,\" Georgette sniffed, \"But I am neither lost nor unwanted. I am simply waiting to be found and returned home.\" She scowled as the voice chuckled again. \"Darlin'\" it drawled, \"Now, I don't claim to know all humans, but from what I lived and seen, you'll be waitin' a long time. You ever wonder why they put up rewards for lost pets? 'Cause most folks won't do anythin' otherwise.\" \"Oh, I assure you money is no issue,\" Georgette retorted with a smile, \"My humans are some of the most affluent in the city. I'm sure they'll offer a very generous reward for me.\" \"For your sake I'm hopin' so,\" said the voice, \"So, ya plan on stayin' wet all night?\" \"If you're offering me shelter I'm afraid I'll have to decline,\" said the Poodle, her voice heavy with disdain as she imagined just what kind of filth lay beneath the streets. \"Fair enough,\" replied the voice, \"But just so you don't die before they find you, I'd recommend ya find some place safe to stay. Rain ain't all ya need to worry about when darkness falls.\" Georgette lifted her gaze from the grate and looked around. There were a great many alleyways on this street that could have been hiding things that only came out at night. Nasty, hungry, vicious things that she had no desire to encounter in the dark. \"Ahem…You wouldn't happen to know of anywhere else I might be able to stay?\" \"Well,\" the voice mused, \"If old Smokey's place is still standin' there's a chance ya got a place for the night.\" \"Smokey?\" the show dog murmured. \"Old cat that used to run the block. Had a gang that patrolled the alleys, used to scare the hell out of the dogs. He lived in a warehouse at the end of the block 'til it caught fire and got burnt out. Wiped out most of the gang, dogs picked off the rest, so it should be empty now if it's still there.\" \"I see,\" Georgette grumbled, \"Are you sure that my only chance to survive the night is in a charred deathtrap on the brink of collapse that may or may not even exist anymore?\" \"Seems that way,\" gurgled the voice as its owner splashed in the waters below, \"Can't think of anywhere else nearby, 'less you wanna hide out in a cardboard box.\" Georgette uttered a piqued sigh and drummed her manicured nails on the wet sidewalk. The last time she'd entered a warehouse she'd almost been killed by a psychotic mobster and his rabid guard dogs, and had broken a nail in the process. The one recommended by the sewer-dweller didn't sound any safer. Even if it was empty, a half-burnt derelict probably wasn't structurally sound. There could be dangers everywhere; rusty nails, broken glass, splinters, mold, not to mention it was likely to be just as dirty as the streets. On the other paw...she'd heard stories of what night on the streets was like. There'd be deranged robbers and murderers skulking around every corner with switchblades in hand; waiting to sink their claws in anything that walked in their path. And if you somehow escaped them, packs of feral dogs that had descended into savagery would come after you with jaws ready to rend flesh and shatter bone. The purebred turned several shades paler as she thought about these things; a queasy bout of fear churning in her stomach. She looked down at the red eyes and murmured quietly. \"Which way to the warehouse?\" The rain showed no sign of letting up as Georgette miserably made her way down the sidewalk. She wasn't sure how long it'd been since she'd turned tail and fled the park, but the sky was getting darker and darker behind the clouds. The show dog felt the sickly little glob of fear in her stomach ooze insidiously. She was running out of time. Sooner or later the night would be here, and along with it the dangers she was increasingly afraid of. She sighed gloomily and shook the water from the neatly trimmed fur on her head. Regret began to pick at the back of her mind and knocked loose a sliver of her ego. If she hadn't run off, she wouldn't be stranded on the streets in the middle of the thunderstorm with only a burnt ruin to look forward to. The Poodles' eyes widened a bit as a realization made another blow to her pride. Dodger and his gang weren't out there suffering with her. They were probably safe and sound back at Fagin's barge. Georgette stumbled a little over the soaked poms on her forelegs. Even refuge aboard a stinking, drafty, unheated barge appealed to her now. And what made it worse was that they could find it all on their own, without almost dying in traffic and without help from mysterious sewer creatures. Why was everything so difficult for her? The show dog growled and kicked at a puddle. Her ego suddenly struck back at the double assault with a vengeance. It wasn't her fault she ran away. If they hadn't shown up to embarrass her, this would never have happened. She'd have finished her walk and gone to her safe, comfortable home. But there was no way they could have known. They were street mutts. They didn't know how hard it was to stay at the top; to be perfect every day, to have rivals trying to topple you left and right for the pettiest of reasons. It was a hard and miserable life. She deserved to be pampered and adored for her efforts. With indignant fury fueling her thoughts, Georgette marched on a little faster, determined to reach the warehouse and get out of the wretched rain. And once morning came she'd be back on the search for someone who recognized her so she'd be returned to the Foxworths. She wasn't quite so sure how she was going to deal with her reputation being destroyed, but she was sure there was something that could be done about it. If anything she had to at least get back at Giselle and Yvonne. They didn't know it, but they'd made a mistake crossing her. She was an unrivaled gossip and a master of rumor mongering, and a brilliant actress as well. The Poodle smiled wickedly. Those two would pay dearly for what they'd done. A horrible bellow suddenly yanked Georgette out of her scheming. Her ears whipped about her face as she whirled around to see a beastly shape barreling out of the alleyway behind her. A snarling mouth of black gum and broken yellow teeth barked at her from a face covered in scars and mangy brown fur. The dog's single bloodshot eye blazed with primal ire as it zeroed in on the Poodle. Georgette stood rooted to the sidewalk, eyes wide with shock as the beast raised its hackles, its body rigid and low to the ground as it stared at her with its crazed eye. It gave a low growl and flashed its ruinous teeth from its torn and ragged jowls. \"H…Hello,\" the Poodle muttered stiffly, her eyes never once blinking as they remained locked on the dog, \"Can I help you?\" The dog growled again, exhaling rotten steam into the chilled air as it licked its chops with a pasty red tongue. Georgette's heart began to race, ticking away the seconds as fear knotted her stomach in a French braid. \"You ain't from here,\" the dog hacked in a voice coarse with cruelty and exhaust fumes, \"Too pretty…\" Georgette blinked in surprise. This dog might have been smarter then he looked. \"N-no, I'm afraid I'm not,\" she gulped, \"I'm just passing through.\" The dog's single eye narrowed, killing Georgette's blossoming smile before it could come to fruition. \"Outsiders ain't allowed on my turf!\" he snarled. The Poodle found her legs again and took an unsteady step back. \"I said I'm just passing through!\" she cried. The dog snorted and snapped his jaws, the smack of teeth and bone and gum sending a jolt through the show dog's core. \"No excuse,\" he rumbled, \"Ya got two choices, girlie. We tear ya apart and eat your fluffy, prissy guts, or…\" He suddenly gave her a smile, which Georgette thought was arguably more hideous than his snarl, \"Ya join us.\" The Poodle stood absolutely still, the only movement coming from her mouth as it dropped open in disbelief. \"…Join you?\" \"Yeah, for dinner!\" the dog howled up at the stormy sky with mangled laughter. He looked back at the now trembling show dog and snorted, \"I don't let sissy house pets in my gang, they ain't nothin' but freeloaders.\" He grinned at her through the rain, \"'Sides, who'd take me seriously if I had a knock-kneed toothpick like you run with the pack? You're more fluff than dog!\" Drool began to seep out of his jowls as he loped toward the Poodle on sandpaper-skinned paws. \"Only good thing 'bout you human-lovers is how tender ya are.\" Georgette was already rocketing down the sidewalk before she knew she was screaming. Her paws hit the concrete in a barrage of wet smacks, splashing the pant legs of humans as her slender form scrambled past them. Her eyes doubled in size as she glanced back to see the brute was now shadowed by two more hollering mongrels, each one as monstrous as he was. The Poodle bawled in terror as lightning flashed overhead. Her heart thundered against her ribs, pumping blood that felt frozen in her veins. Her face was drawn in a wild-eyed grimace, teeth clenched so tightly she thought they would shatter at any moment. The feral horde's barking was growing closer. Another streak of lightning suddenly arced across the sky. For the briefest moment Georgette could see an enormous brick building just a little further down the block, the windows shattered, with great discolored blotches snaking over the bricks where fire had seared and weakened them. The Poodle felt a glimmer of hope somewhere in her horrorstruck body. She forced her tired legs to pump even faster even as she searched the warehouse for an entryway, whining in apprehension as she scanned the sagging walls for a door, a low window, a- Her eyes lit up as they locked on a small hole just below a window; its crumbling edges stained with soot. Georgette's grimace became a smile as she darted beneath the window sill and dove through the aperture, her vision melting into darkness the second she dove into the building. She panted as she slid to a stop over what felt like dirt and coarse concrete. Her lungs were burning, her legs felt as limp as noodles, and she was certain her coat was an utter disaster. But so long as she wasn't torn to bits by rabid street dogs, she could learn to be fine with it. In the very next moment Georgette pressed herself flat against the wall, rigid as a statue, eyes locked on the hole that acted as her doorway. Her heart continued to pound like mad as she heard leathery paws scraping the sidewalk. The entryway suddenly darkened as the three dogs crowded around it, their scarred noses sucking in the musty air. The show dog held her breath as she saw the hunger in their jaundiced eyes, coupled with terrifying determination. But their ferocious snarls suddenly began to fade, lips closing over their life-ending teeth. Georgette thought she saw something creep over their faces; something that could almost be taken for fear. But it was gone in a fleeting moment, and shortly afterward the dogs vanished into the rain-drenched streets. The Poodle let out an exhausted gasp, sliding down onto the floor as the tension went out of her muscles. She dragged herself further inside and looked out over the warehouse with a tired smile. She was certain she was going to be appalled by everything it had to offer, but she could only take so much anguish at a time. She reached out with a paw and tried to find a patch of concrete that wasn't totally filthy and sat down. Somewhere she could hear rain pouring in from a leak, or maybe several leaks in the roof. Shapes slowly began to appear as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. The floor was littered with piles of ash and jagged, flaking metal. Here and there were pieces of crates that survived as charred planks half-buried beneath the ashes. Warped and deflated bottles were strewn in clusters, the now opaque glass crisscrossed with spider-web fractures. A pungent smell hung over everything, and it wormed its way into Georgette's nose and drew a disgusted sneer from the purebred's face. It wasn't just a single scent, more like a variety that melded into an overbearing odor. The smoky smell of burnt pine was obvious, mixed with tart fried wires, powdery charred mortar, and sour smoldered tarp. Time had fermented all of these, and thrown in new scents of mold and must. Georgette sat and scowled in the dark. The problem of the utter hideousness of the warehouse could be solved by closing her eyes. But the nauseating odor would remain. Even worse, it could get in her coat, and she'd be stuck with it until she could get another bath. The show dog let out a grumble and tried to sweep a clean little circle for her to lie down upon. It was likely she was already covered in filth just from walking the streets, but she'd rather not get any dirtier. \"Well, well, well, what have we here?\" Georgette jumped with a start at the sound of a voice as smooth as fire, her ears wildly flopping about her face as she looked for its source. Her heart skipped a beat as she found it. A tall, bony shadow stood in the entryway. Its pale green eyes twinkled maliciously as it flashed a crescent of jagged teeth. Crooked, twisted whiskers twitched in amusement as the shadow loped toward her, its wiry muscles flexing beneath ashy gray fur. A long, snaking tail swayed in time to the clack of its hooked claws on the concrete. The monstrous cat strode up to her and ran its paw through the fur on its head. Georgette swallowed a lump in her throat and began to back away. \"I, ah, am terribly sorry,\" she murmured sheepishly, \"I was told there'd be no one here.\" The cat laughed and circled the Poodle, his grin stretched from ear to ragged ear. \"Can see how most people think that,\" the cat chortled, \"This place ain't as lively as it used to be. But we're still here.\" Georgette felt the uneasiness returned to her stomach as the gangly feline spun lightly on its paws, kicking up ash and grime in a playful manner. \"Did you say, 'We'?\" she said, forcing a polite smile that didn't match the nervousness in her eyes. \"Sure did,\" said the cat as he rocked his shoulders from side to side, \"A cat like me doesn't need this whole place to himself.\" He raised a fore-paw and examined his claws, \"That's not to say you ain't welcome. It's been a long time since we had any guests.\" Georgette's false smile widened as fear iced its way down her spine. \"That's quite alright,\" she replied anxiously, \"Thanks for the invitation, but I only stopped for a short break. I'll be going now.\" The Poodle tried to take a few cautious steps around the cat. He simply continued to grin at her, green eyes flashing like emeralds in his head each time her gaze met his. A crash echoed throughout the warehouse, like someone toppling a trash heap the size of a small mountain. Georgette froze where she stood as a vast round shape came bounding out of the dark, booming each time it bounced against the ground. She stared in disbelief as a huge base drum rolled right over the entryway, dust flying off of its rusted lugs as it settled into place. The Poodle took a step back, jaw dropping as she turned to the cat. He greeted her with a wicked smile, swaying in time with his tail as it flicked impishly from side to side. He looked out over the warehouse at things Georgette couldn't see and howled out into the dark, his voice ringing as clear as a bell. \" Hi de hi de ho!\" The heavy air was suddenly alive with sound. Georgette heard rustling that seemed to come from everywhere. The whole building seemed to shake and rattle on its foundation. Cobwebs and nails fell from the ceiling; bricks fell from loose mortar and tumbled out onto the ground. A shriek barreled out of Georgette's mouth as she saw a skeletal claw burst out of the layers of ashes that coated the floor. It was followed by the bones of a fore-leg, then a cracked shoulder blade, and then a battered skull. It uttered a rasping wail as it tore itself free, its vertebrae crackling as it looked right at the show dog with eyes it didn't have. More followed. Dozens of charred, blackened feline skeletons of every shape and size pulled themselves from the ashes; heaved from beneath piles of garbage, clambered from cracks in the walls and floors. Their joints creaked and clattered as they rose to their claws and stumbled toward the mortified Poodle. Their jawbones stretched open, the browned teeth scraping against one another as soot and ash tumbled from their empty eye sockets. All of them called out in a ghastly chorus of dust-dry voices. \" Hi de hi de ho!\" Georgette slowly moved backwards, her legs shaking fiercely every time they lifted a paw from the ground. The Poodle's chest rose and fell like a bellows as it sucked in huge gulps of the sour air. Her gaping eyes swiveled in her head as they tried to take in the sight of the fleshless horde. The rattling and clacking of ancient bones filled her ears, growing louder as they inched closer. Grimy fangs were gnashed, soot-stained claws flexed apprehensively; seared tails were lashed like whips. Georgette bawled as she was cornered, her back flattening against an icy brick wall. The gray cat appeared, strolling nonchalantly between the shambling skeletons. He looked almost twice as big as before, the air dancing and wavering around his fur as though he were searing hot. His corpse-gray coat looked almost white against the blackened bricks as he grinned at the squirming Poodle. \"What do ya say we entertain our guest?\" he said, his green eyes simmering like two pools of poison. Georgette's claws dug into the concrete as the macabre mob erupted into a chorus of manic cheers. She whimpered as they scrambled like spiders around the warehouse, dragging junk from the corners and yanking refuse from the ash piles. The Poodle howled as a ghastly racket poured into her ears. A pair of femurs drew a wavering rhythm from a set of derelict drums. Burnt and dented trumpets wailed raunchily along with other battered brass; twisted trombones blared while sagging saxophones screeched. Withered clarinets shrieked and hollered as someone raked their claws across the wilted strings of a charred bass. Some maniac pounded a sleazy melody from the cracked keys of an off-tune piano. The enormous cat began to dance in the middle of the floor, swaying from side to side as he took exaggerated steps with his willowy limbs. He slid back and forth on the dusty floor while his tail lashed in time to the music, legs crossing one another as he leaped and spun about. He grinned devilishly at the terrified Georgette, his neck craning forward so that his face was a mere inch from her nose. The Poodle shrank back against the wall as she felt his searing breath blow through her primped and perfect coat, reeking of smoke and stale cigars. She went pale as she looked into his eyes. The pupils swirled like blobs of ink until they resembled a pair of skulls—dog skulls. Georgette felt her heart drop into her stomach as the cat continued his dance, his body twisting and turning at unnatural angles, spine contorting and stretching fluidly as his legs grew longer and shorter with every step. His razor-toothed maw opened wide as his voice swirled out on ashy breath into the warehouse, as potent as gunpowder. \" Folks, now here's the story of Georgette the Moocher, She was a high-class purebred poocher, She was the Foxworth's pride and joy, But Georgette's little heart was fickle and coy!\" The monstrous cat swiveled around on its paws and hollered out to the skeletal band. Every verse he wailed was echoed by their faltering screeches. \" Hi de hi de hi!\" (Hi de hi de hi!) \" Ho de ho de ho!\" (Ho de ho de ho!) \"He DEE he DEE!\" (He DEE he DEE!) \" Hi de hi de ho!\" (Hi de hi de ho!) The brass howled as the smoldering feline whirled back to Georgette. \" She strut around just to make a livin', Her beauty won her cups and ribbons, She was the talk all over town, She knew just how to throw her weight around!\" \" Knew just how to throw her weight around!\" screeched two skeletons as they appeared on either side of Georgette. The Poodle shrieked and threw herself from the wall, scrambling and slipping over the ashy floor as she darted past the giant cat. She yelped sharply as something caught hold of her tail, tripping over her spindly legs and landing with a painful thud. Her claws grabbed madly at the ground as she was dragged backwards. She gritted her teeth as she looked over her shoulder to see the cat's viperous tail wrapped around her own, yanking her fiercely as he sang with his minions. \" Hi de hi de hi de hi!\" (Hi de hi de hi de hi!) \" Ho de ho de ho de ho!\" (Ho de ho de ho de ho!) Five of the ghouls knelt down in front of Georgette as she squirmed helplessly. Five more trotted over with a collection of rusted axes and hatchets, raising them over the kneeler's necks. The cat's eyes went ablaze with wicked mirth as he fired out the next verse. \" Oh de oh de dee dat de DEY!\" (Oh de oh de dee dat de DEY!) The Poodle squealed in disgust and horror as the executioners brought down their weapons with a thunderous smack, sending the skulls tumbling over the show dog to land at the giant cat's paws. The feline threw his head back and howled. \" Hi de hi de ho!\" \" Hi de hi de ho!\" echoed the skulls. Georgette screamed as she was pulled clear from the floor, flying backwards into a pile of half-burnt rags. Her eyes watered from dust and terror as she tried to get to her paws, clearing just in time to see the cat striding toward her. \" She lived a life of class and riches, Got all her wants and whims and wishes, She had a bowl made of gold and steel, A platinum bone and a royal seal!\" The rags around Georgette suddenly sprang to life. Enormous rats squeaked in terror as they burst out of the mildewed cloth, scampering off into the dark corners of the warehouse uttering horrified squeaks. The cat twirled and pranced around the Poodle as she flailed and tore herself free of the rotting cloth, gibbering as she tore across the warehouse only to be confronted by a wall of slack-jawed skeletons reaching for her. She fell on her haunches as she slid to a stop, just barely avoiding their claws. She whirled around to see the cat grinning sardonically as he shrieked with the chorus in tow. \" Oh skip dat dip dad diddy doo!\" (Oh skip dat dip dad diddy doo!) \" Skibby dip de dedopdodoh!\" (Skibby dip de dedopdodoh!) \" Oh dat dat dat daddy o!\" (Oh dat dat dat daddy o!) \" Hi de hi de ho!\" (Hi de hi de ho!) Georgette moaned in despair as she dashed forward, the sound of skeletal paws clacking on the floor only inches behind her. The demonic cat smirked as she neared him, his corkscrewed whiskers twitching as his tail shot out in her path and wrapped around her paw. She howled and thrashed, yanking and twisting in a futile attempt to free herself. \" Suitors would beg for her paw in marriage, Each one she met she'd always disparage, She had their hearts, and they had her pity, She was the cruelest dog in all New York City!\" The cat began to pull her closer, his grin widening to an impossible degree. Georgette whimpered and wailed as she was dragged toward the ghostly feline, trembling as she heard the clattering bones of the skeletons encircling her, closing in and clacking their jaws in ragged laughter. The cat jeered another chorus as he seemed to tower higher and higher over the show dog. \" Oh ho de ho de ho!\" (Oh ho de ho de ho!) \" Hiiii de hi de hi!\" (Hiiii de hi de hi!) \" WHOOOAAAAAAA~!\" The beast suddenly lunged forward and howled in the Poodle's face, his eyes rolling wildly in their sockets as Georgette felt dozens of claws clamp onto her coat. The purebred uttered a bloodcurdling scream. \" AAAAAAAAAUUGHHH!\" The cat simply gave her a sinister wink and crooned softly. \" Hi de hi de ho~\" \" Hi de hi de ho!\" replied the horde as lifted Georgette from the ground, hauling her on her back like she was a coffin. The Poodle kicked and squirmed, fighting with everything she had left, but it was no use. She hollered and pleaded, but her cries fell on deaf ears. The ghouls began a solemn march toward the middle of the room as the song came to a close, the giant cat finishing in a final yowl. \" Poor girl, Poor girl, Poor~ girl~!\" Georgette paused in her mad attempts to free herself from the skeletons as she saw where they were heading. There was a long, deep, crooked crack in the pavement. It was wide enough for a human to pass through, and a large human at that. A terrible realization shook through the Poodle as the undead felines approached it, piercing her to her very core. She redoubled her efforts to free herself, swinging her paws at skulls and howling at the top of her lungs. The skeletons stumbled as she thrashed her body from side to side, but their needle-sharp claws remained locked tight in her fur. The gash seemed to yawn wider before her tearful eyes; a deep, black pit that stretched into a jagged mouth. There was a sudden thrum from across the warehouse. The skeletons paused, their vertebrae creaking as their skulls faced the base drum that covered the entryway. It shook and rattled again before flying forward; tipping onto the concrete with a hollow thump that stirred up a cloud of dust. Georgette stared as it settled; giving her a glimpse of five shapes rushing in through the hole and clustering together. The corners of her mouth dared to twitch into something of a smile as she recognized them. Einstein stood protectively over his friends, his gentleness turned into fierceness. The broad-shouldered Francis, normally civil and eloquent, bared his teeth in a savage snarl. Rita's eyes gleamed dangerously as she crouched low to the ground, ready to leap at any given moment. Dodger stood beside her, muzzle drawn into a toothy sneer. And standing between Rita and Dodger was Tito, his jaws clamped tight around the end of a pink leash. \"Hey Gatos!\" bellowed the Chihuahua as he narrowed his eyes, \"Get away from my woman!\" \"Alonzo!\" cried Georgette as she began struggling with renewed energy. Her ghoulish captors suddenly lurched to life again, rattling as they charged at the newcomers in a frenzy of teeth and claws. The Poodle found herself being dragged away by the ones that carried her, watching in horror as the horde crashed against Dodger's pack like a wave breaking over a rock. Bones flew everywhere as the dogs erupted into battle, their barking rising over the cats' yowls and snarls. Georgette squirmed and shook herself as the racket grew louder, the mere chance that she might be rescued giving her strength she'd thought she'd already spent. Einstein kicked in great big arcs, sending two down at a time. Francis chomped on skulls and legs and tore them from their owners, spitting them out with what looked like revulsion. Rita dashed and dipped with a dancer's grace, her silky fur trailing behind her as she snapped her jaws and plucked her opponents to bits. Dodger clamped his teeth around ribs and legs, shaking the creatures wildly back and forth. The Poodle looked around for Tito. She heard the Chihuahua yipping wildly, catching glimpses of him amid the horde cracking her leash like a whip; skulls flying from crooked necks with every ireful lash. Georgette watched with a growing sense of shame and guilt as the dogs fought against the charred felines. After how she'd treated them; after all the horrible things she'd said right to their faces, they'd shown up ready to fight for her. Even Tito, who she'd been the cruelest to, was taking on creatures almost twice his size to save her. The Poodle couldn't honestly say she'd do the same were she in their position, and knowing that tore her up more than anything she'd been through in the past few hours. \"Hey baby, I'm comin'!\" Four skeletons in front of Georgette suddenly had their legs knocked out from beneath by a pink leash, clattering the floor in a mess of tibias and toe bones. A grinning Chihuahua nimbly pounced from skull to skull toward the Poodle. \"Alonzo!\" she cried, her heart leaping in her chest as she yanked once more at the claws that held her, \"Alonzo, I'm so sorry!\" \"It's alright!\" replied Tito as he ducked beneath a charging ghoul's legs and tripped it. \"No, it's not!\" sobbed the Poodle as she felt one of her forelegs free. With a viciousness that surprised even her, she turned and punched one of her captor's skulls across the room, \"I've behaved terribly.\" She felt another creature grab for her free limb and instead wrenched the offender's foreleg from its socket, using it to swat and club at the skeletons. \"\"It'll be fine,\" answered Tito, the leash clenched tightly in his smile as he caught hold of an attacker's tail with the other end and yanked the creature into two, \"It's all gonna be fine!\" \"Ya think so?\" Both dogs felt a shudder run through their spines as they heard an oily voice pour out of a mouth lined with too many teeth. Georgette cringed as she looked over to see the monstrous cat weaving its way through the chaos of the warehouse. Smoke and cinders trailed from his body as his fur stood on end like tongues of flame; spitting sparks with every breath and leaving paw prints burnt into the floor behind him. The fierce confidence in Tito's eyes wavered as the cat bore down at him with his crooked smile. Georgette shrieked as four searing claws soared through the darkness and lashed out at Tito. The Chihuahua gritted his teeth as he ducked, gulping as he saw some of the red fur on his head fall to the floor. In a moment he was darting backwards, missing another swipe of the terrible hooked claws. \"Alonzo!\" choked Georgette as her captors broke out into raspy cheering and hooting. The Poodle grimaced as Tito growled and circled the feline, suddenly cracking the leash at the creature's paws. The cat snorted and nimbly stepped to the side, catching it between the floor and his forepaw. He oozed laughter as he watched Tito throw himself backwards again and again to try and free it. The Chihuahua snarled and snorted with the courage of a dog five times his size before he dropped the leash and leapt at the cat, his small jaws latching onto the feline's elbow. His opponent yowled in annoyance as the dog thrashed from side to side, tearing wildly at something that wasn't quite fur or flesh. Ice touched Georgette's heart as she saw the cat strike Tito with a sweeping kick from his hind leg, knocking the Chihuahua to the floor. In a split second a smoldering paw was slammed down on the canine's chest. Tito let out a wheezing gasp, coughing and spitting ash from his gums. He froze, eyes going wide as he saw the cat's other foreleg rise high up into the air, claws extended and ready to tear. \"NO!\" Before she knew what was happening, Georgette was racing forwards. The skeletons that still clung to her were clattering to bits as she bolted toward the cat, her teary eyes glowing with determination. She saw his hideous face turn toward her, mouth opening in a shower of sparks and cinders as it let out a hiss. The undeterred Poodle screamed as she rammed into his shoulder. Dust and ash flew everywhere as if she'd struck one of her powder puffs, but still she did not stop. It was only when the cat's weight suddenly vanished she came to a halt, looking down just in time to see a pair of blazing green eyes vanishing below into the cavernous pit. For a moment the Poodle simply stared down at the darkness, shocked at what she had done. Georgette howled as she felt the ground suddenly give way beneath her, a chunk of concrete groaning as it fell away from her paws and tumbled downwards, landing somewhere at the bottom with a brittle crunch. She felt weightless for a brief second just before she began to follow suite, but something suddenly dug into her tail. The purebred yelped, her long legs scrambling for a moment before she was pulled upward. Concrete slide beneath her body as she was dragged away from the edge of the pit, and coarse and filthy as it was, she was glad it was there. She glanced over her shoulder, eyes softening at what she saw. Tito had clamped his jaws around her tail. Dodger, likewise, had grabbed Tito's tail, and the chain continued onwards with Francis, Rita, and Einstein. Once she was pulled to safety they all let go, slouching tiredly as they looked out over the thousands of bones that littered the warehouse floor. Each one lay still now, no more alive than anything else that lay abandoned in the dust. A fatigue had set in over everyone, and for a moment they all quietly panted in the silence of the dead darkness while gazing at one another. \"…Alonzo,\" Georgette breathed at last as she stared down at the exhausted Chihuahua, \"You saved me.\" She looked up at the rest of the pack and spoke with a meek quiver in her voice, \"You all saved me.\" Her soft, guilty features were met with a wide grin from Tito. \"'Course we did,\" he said, \"You're family, baby.\" He placed his diminutive paw on Georgette's own, \"Nothin' will ever change that.\" Georgette's misty eyes glanced down at the ground. She vainly fought against the emotions that suddenly took hold of her, wanting to retain some form of dignity. She began to shiver, her sniffling growing louder and more drawn out as her eyes became wellsprings. \"I…I'm so sorry for what I said to you all!\" sobbed the Poodle as she wiped at her eyes, makeup smudging and staining her paws, \"I truly am! I don't deserve friends like you…\" She felt another paw place itself on her shoulder and looked over at the warm, weary face of Rita. \"Aw honey, that's not true,\" the Saluki mix said softly, \"You just got a little angry.\" The long-haired dog smiled, \"I've called these knuckleheads worse when they get on my bad side. Just ask Dodger.\" Georgette turned her teary gaze to Dodger. The Terrier mutt shrugged, a familiar cocky grin returning to his muzzle. \"She ain't lyin', Champ,\" he laughed, \"For such a pretty lady she sure does have an ugly mouth.\" Rita sighed and rolled her eyes. \"See what I mean?\" Georgette sniffed, eyes surrounded by mascara melted by sorrow. \"So…none of you are mad at me?\" she murmured. \"I'm not,\" Einstein shook his head, his loose jowls drawn into a placid smile. \"It would be accurate to say we'd prefer you didn't speak to us like that,\" Francis added as he dusted cobwebs from his shoulder, \"But like Einstein, I harbor no ill feelings toward you.\" Georgette felt the icy sting of shame gradually lessen and looked down at the Chihuahua still holding her paw. He smiled up at her, lifting her forepaw and giving it a kiss. \"No need to ask me, baby,\" he said with a wink, \"You know I can't stay mad at you.\" Georgette smiled, shedding a fresh tear as she suddenly took him up in her forelegs and hugged him tight against her chest. \"Marvelous,\" the Poodle said before giving Tito's cheek a smooch, \"I never want to make you mad at me again.\" Tito grinned, dazed and giddy from the kiss. Rita and Francis watched the exchange warm smiles. Dodger held his mouth shut and choked on laughter, earning him a reproachful glanre from Rita. Einstein, however, was not watching any of them. His attention was fixed on the thick cloud of smoke rising out of the crevice. \"Hey guys…\" Everyone glanced to the Great Dane, and then followed his rigid gaze to the swirling, billowing mass of smoke that whispered its way up in a twisted column towards the ceiling. They winced as two bursts of blinding green exploded like ancient camera bulbs from within the pillar, raging out of control like twin oil fires. The smoke took shape around them, building wispy ears and a wavering face, an unsteady head that left bits of itself behind as it turned to focus on the floor with its lighthouse eyes. An immense mouth stretched opened and howled like a roaring blaze. \" HI DE HI DE HO!\" At once the floor became clouded with ash as bones began to roll over its charcoal dunes, bouncing back to their siblings. Skulls chattered noisily on their sides as spines slithered and centipede-crawled with odd-numbered ribs. Half-made limbs stood up and hopped back into sockets while claws and toes popped together like magnets. \"I recommend we vacate the premises immediately,\" suggested Francis. The words were hardly out of his mouth before he and the other canines were scrambling to the hole in the wall, Tito still clinging to Georgette's neck as she raced over scuttling ribcages and tooth-gnashing skulls. Rita yelped as unfinished clawed limbs sprang up and made grabs for her silken fur. One by one the dogs flew through the aperture, the lifeless, dusty air pumping out of their lungs and being replaced with the freezing moisture of thunderstorm dampness. Six soggy shapes dragged themselves through the sidewalks of a waterlogged street, heads bowed and panting with exhaustion. Though every few seconds they glanced behind them for rattling, dismembered skeletons crawling after them through murky puddles, it seemed nothing had pursued them out of the warehouse. The more they distanced themselves from that infernal tomb of the vengeful dead, the more the terror left their bodies, taking their energy along with it. \"There was something…\" Georgette paused and shook rain droplets from her lashes, \"Something I wanted to ask you all back there.\" Dodger looked over his shoulder at the Poodle. \"What was it, Champ?\" \"How on earth did you manage to find me?\" Dodger flashed a grin and chuckled sagely. \"Well that was a very interesin' story, actually,\" said the Terrier Mix as he strutted along with high spirits, \"We owe a lot to the big guy here. He's got a good nose on him, and we woulda got ya sooner if the storm hadn't washed out your trail.\" Georgette looked to Einstein, who smiled with sheepish humility, \"Your perfume smells like roses,\" the Great Dane murmured. Georgette blinked, slowly beginning to smile. \"It does,\" she said, \"Or, well, it did earlier today.\" \"Yeah, so as luck would have it,\" continued Dodger, \"When we lost your scent, Tito saw your leash lyin' in the road.\" \"I figured he did,\" Georgette said, looking over at the Chihuahua who proudly marched beside her, \"I've been meaning to thank you for finding it.\" \"It was nothin', honey,\" Tito grinned as he splashed through a puddle, \"There's no car on the road that can run me down.\" \"So anyways,\" cut in Dodger, \"We got to the other side of the road, and who do we meet but Al. So we ask him if he seen ya, and he says he sent ya down to that haunted dump we found ya in.\" Georgette paused, raising a brow. \"Al? You mean that… thing in the drain?\" \"Yeah, Al,\" Dodger confirmed casually, \"Poor guy got flushed down there years ago. So we followed his directions to the warehouse, but got in a bit of trouble with a dog gang on the way there.\" Georgette felt a chill in her bones as a memory of ragged teeth and scarred jowls flashed before her eyes. \"That one-eyed creep and his thugs almost killed me!\" she gulped, \"How did you get past him?\" \"That would be my doing,\" said Francis, his broad mouth spreading into a smile, \"I used my theatrical expertise to convince the brutes we members of a much larger, fiercer gang, that would be moving into the area, and with some encouragement from Rita and Einstein, they fled the block.\" \"And after that, we found the warehouse, busted in, beat up some skeletons, and rescued you,\" Dodger finished, \"And, might I add, got you home.\" Georgette blinked in surprise as she saw a familiar wrought iron fence, recognition firing in her brain and turning to delight. The Poodle donned a joyful smile as she looked beyond the mist-speckled ironwork to the enormous house that it encircled. She could hardly keep herself from bolting to the door and barking until Winston answered. But instead she quietly turned around, smiling at every one of the dogs who she now appreciated more than ever. \"I want to thank all of you again,\" she said, \"For everything you've done for me.\" She smiled sheepishly, \"And, if you have the time, maybe you could stop by tomorrow? Oliver would like to see you all, and I'm sure you could tell the story better than I can.\" \"Hey, Absotively posilutely,\" Dodger grinned, \"We all miss the little guy too.\" Georgette nodded before glancing down at Tito. \"Alonzo,\" she said, \"Do you think you could give me some more dancing lessons?\" The Chihuahua's eyes lit up with excitement. \"Sure thing,\" he yipped, his tail wagging wildly, \"Maybe we could start with a Meringue?\" Georgette beamed warmly as she regarded him. \"That sounds perfect.\" She leaned down and planted a kiss on his muzzle.

He was having a nightmare again. A nightmare involving his father's death when Ryan was only a little puppy. It still haunts him even to this day after moving in with the Company a few weeks ago. He heard a train whistle, blowing loudly and deeply like a lonely wolf howling in the night sky. He then heard an explosion. A loud explosion, followed by a horrific scream of pain and agony. It sounded like his father's voice, which soon faded into nothing as everything around him faded into darkness. A terrifying face of his dead father soon popped up infront of him and was coming closer to him with burnt fur, dead eyes and blood surrounding him! \"AHHHH!\" Ryan yelped, instantly waking up from his spot. His ears dropped within seconds, frightened as heck and his legs shaking in fear and fright. He let out a little quiet moan and looked around, seeing the Company and Fagin still asleep in the barge even after he let out a scream. All but one. \"Ryan?\" came a female voice. Ryan jumped and looked down to his left. His sweetheart Rita had been woken up by his scream of fright and began to flutter her eyes sleepfully, looking worried for her boyfriend. He began to take deep breaths, with tears forming in his eyes, about to cry. By then, Rita had every right to be worried. \"What's the matter hun?\" she whispered softly. Even after started dating, the red haired Saluki couldn't help but notice her boyfriend having nightmares here and there, much more than she had after the Sykes' death. This was concerning to her and the rest of the gang, especially Dodger who had to comfort the dog whenever they were out and when she wasn't able to help comfort him. The Dalmatian instantly buried his face right up against his girlfriend's body and began to cry. He tried his best not to cry out loud or even let out his unique howl that sounded more like a train whistle than a dog howl. Tears rolled down from his face onto Rita's body before they landed on the floor. The past couple of nights had been rough with him, mostly thanks to the nightmares of his father's death and almost being put down. He wished these nightmares would go away soon, but by the looks of it, it was only getting worst. Rita reached a paw to Ryan's back and began to pat him softly, shushing him quietly as she comforted the poor autistic dog. \"There there honey\" she whispered. \"You've been having that nightmare again, haven't you?\" Ryan simply nodded, sniffling loudly, doing his best to fight back the tears. But he was only failing to do so. \"I-It was terrible Rita\" he sniffled. \"Having a nightmare of your own father's death. It's something you can't fall asleep peacefully. It will come and haunt you... like... like...\" He was starting to have a hard time trying to catch his breath, surprisingly still not waking either Dodger, Einstein or the whole gang up from his sniffling and crying. \"Shhhhh…. take a deep breath Ry, take a deep breath\" hushed Rita as she stroked her spotted sweetheart's back. Taking deep breaths, Ryan tried to calm himself down. He quivered and sniffled even further as he took deep breaths. Breathing in through his nose, exhaling through his mouth. Breathing in through his nose, exhaling through his mouth. He did this several times, slowly regaining control and feeling calm. \"Okay\" he said calmly. \"Good\" sighed Rita with a bit of relief. \"Now hun, I understand losing your father has been really rough with you and me and the guys felt very sorry for you.\" Ryan shook his head in sadness and depression. \"You never knew my father Rita. None of you did. My father was the best father you'd ever want. Tell me bed time stories before bed, most of them being adventures he had while being a railroad dog, piggyback rides like my mom did, lots of love and comfort, so many things a father would do to his loving pup.\" More tears could be seen coming out of the poor dog's eyes as he was about to cry once more. Rita knew this wasn't working, so she thought of something she'd never revealed to any of the members of the gang. \"I never had a long lasting puppyhood like you did\" she admitted with a frown. This revelation made Ryan's eyes wide with shock. He thought Rita was actually bluffing. \"You're bluffing. You're bluffing sweetheart. Surely a sweet girl like you had a wonderful childhood before...\" he trailed off when he felt Rita's paw pressed up against his lips. Rita blushed a little at the compliment, smiling slightly before she frowned once more. \"I didn't\" she said and sighed, looking away from her boyfriend. \"I never had a puppyhood with my parents.\" There was a long silence, minus the snores coming from Fagin and the others. They both had no idea that Dodger was secretly listening, opening one eye very slightly. Rita sighed again before she began. \"When I was your age, I lived in an apartment somewhere near Central Park. I was in a family of 4, with me being the youngest of the bunch. My mom was a more proper Saluki, while my dad was... ironically, a street dog like us. I had my mother's side in terms of appearance and looks, while I have the tail of my father's. Me and my mother never got along, mostly because of me wanting to be like my dad when I was older, and even my sisters thought I was crazy. Probably because mom brain washed them.\" Both Ryan and Rita giggled quietly, until the Saluki went on frowning. \"As for my dad, he and I were close. As close as you and your father were. He would often tell me how to survive the streets if I did follow his footsteps, what to do when out alone and how to pretty be who I am today. It was nice. He'd even take me out to see some of the sights at night too, much to my mom's disapproval of staying up late while the rest of my sisters are asleep whenever we come home late in the evening. Mom and dad often argued, making things a bit rough for me and my sisters. The final straw came when I nearly gotten myself killed when dad took me out to watch the subway trains go by at Grand Central Terminal. I slipped and fell onto the tracks and there was a train coming. Dad managed to get me out of the way in time, but it did cost him half of his tail in the process. My mom was very upset and she demanded a divorce, leaving me to pick who I'd go with.\" Ryan was now feeling very sorry for his girlfriend. Never once had he'd heard of Rita's puppyhood or her past. Not even from Dodger or Francis, or even Einstein. This was very shocking news to hear from her. \"I went with my dad and him and I searched for a new home. We found one, a small little box just near the spot where Oliver met Dodger a while back. It didn't last forever as I hoped. One rainy night, a group of rough dogs came by and started surrounding our home, leaving my father to defend me. He told me, 'If I don't make it Little R, just remember this. You were daddy's favorite girl'. He soon began to fight the other dogs in a desperate attempt to protect me. But... in the end... he didn't make it.\" By that point, Rita was starting to cry herself. Tears began to form in her eyes and they began to roll down her face and onto the floor. If you asked the whole Company, they would swear that they never had seen Rita cry at all. Only time she did was when she felt sorry for yelling at her boyfriend and she almost cried when she thought Oliver died after the big chase from the Sykes. But, she bravely continued on. Sniffling sadly, but bravely continued her story. \"The dogs killed my father. He laid there, right in front of my eyes, and I was too scared and too upset to even move. If it hadn't been for Fagin scaring the dogs away... I... I wouldn't be here talking to you.\" This time it was Rita's turn to lay her head into her boyfriend's body. Ryan was beyond speechless. He now understood that Rita's puppyhood wasn't a pretty one as his. It would explain why she hardly talked about her parents whenever he talked about his, when he was tough enough to do so of course. He didn't say anything as he felt Rita cry against his body. He simply just began to rub the crying Saluki's back, hushing her softly and doing his best to comfort her. \"Oh Rita. I wish I knew sooner\" he said. Rita sniffled some more, before she took some deep breaths. For a street smart girl, she sure can cry, but Ryan had already seen her cry before. \"I didn't tell most of the gang about it, but since you were feeling depressed about your father's death again, I thought it'd be best to share the pain too.\" \"Awww but Rita, you're crying like I was\" frowned the Dalmatian. Rita nodded, \"I know. But at least we're sharing the pain together, right?\" The spotted dog didn't know if he should be touched or flattered, but he knew that his sweetheart was right. They both knew how it feels to lose someone you loved deeply. So both of them began to hug each other deeply, with Rita slowly calming herself down. Her tail wagged slowly before it curled around her boyfriend's own tail, forming a little heart together. \"You know\" Ryan whispered softly. \"My dad once told me something. He told me, 'In the darkness, you'll never be alone. There's always someone who'll shine light on you'. He told me that whenever I was scared of the dark, and I guess I've been having nightmares of him just so he can make sure I remember him.\" Rita smiled lovingly, \"Well I don't think he'd want you waking up in the middle of the night over nightmares of his death. You should think about happier stuff. Like Einstein and Dodger being your best friends, the fun times you had with your mother and father, or even me.\" The kind words made Ryan smile and then nodded, agreeing with his sweetheart. \"You're right. I should think about the happier stuff than the scarier stuff.\" The smile on her boyfriend's muzzle made Rita smile back. She was happy to see that the autistic mutt was feeling better and gave him a goodnight kiss on the lips. \"I think we should get back to sleep then honey.\" \"I can't agree with you more, Chica Rita\" winked Ryan. \"Goodnight sweetheart. I love you.\" \"Goodnight my love. I love you too.\" Ryan closed his eyes softly, only to open one eye and looked at his true love. \"Rita, thank you.\" Rita giggled quietly, \"You're welcome, Ryee Poo.\" She soon began to doze off into a deep slumber, snoring quietly as her tail was still attached to her boyfriend's. Ryan soon fell asleep too, snoring quietly too. He began to dream about the fun times he had with his family. From chasing frisbees in the park to listening to his father's bedtime stories. He even dreamed of the fun he was having with the gang, from Dodger teaching him how to car surf to Einstein providing him warmth from his body when he was feeling cold one night. But the one thing he dreamed of, was Rita. He dreamed of the wonderful dates they were having together and all the love she was giving him, better than his ex girlfriend Tiffany. As for Rita, she dreamed of her father and all the fun times she had with him before he died. From listening to his tips and tricks, to catching sticks with him in the park and even sleeping with him on some nights. But she could remember one part of her dream that she'll never forget. She saw Shaun, looking at her but not giving her a nightmare. He was smiling at her and seeing him made her smile too. He told her how proud he was for helping his son and promised to tell her father she said \"hello\" to him before he vanished, letting her dream about her father some more. But there was one thing she couldn't believe she heard that night. Did she actually hear a deep male voice saying, \"I'm proud of you, Little R\" in the middle of her slumber? Note: Thought I was dead? Well no I'm not really. I've been busy with other things, such as DeviantArt, Trainz: A New Era and real life. But after getting this story idea, I thought I'd post it on here and show you all that I'm not done with Ryan and Company stories. They may not be posted a lot like they use to, but hey, at least they're still around right? But anyways, I hope you enjoy the story. Feel free to review the story if you wish.

Runaway Rita Fanfic by Brockster550 Once upon a time, a saluki was seen lurking through the streets of New York City. Her name was Rita (her name was engraved on a worn-out pink collar around her neck) and she was a runaway. Supposedly, she was too much trouble at her previous residence, which she ran away from three weeks ago. (Rita's memory) Rita was taking a nap on her dog bed when she heard two of her owners (a man and his 8 year old daughter) talking, in another room. Rita lifted her head and perked her ears up to hear the discussion better, but realized that this was a discussion she didn't want to hear. \"Vicky, we need to get rid of Rita,\" said the man. \"She's a real nuisance.\" \"No she isn't, daddy,\" cried the girl named Vicky. \"What m-makes you think otherwise?\" \"She just is,\" said Vicky's father. \"Tomorrow, we're taking her to the pound.\" \"No, daddy!\" pleaded Vicky. \"No ifs, ands or buts, Vicky,\" said her father firmly. \"We're getting rid of Rita and that's final.\" Rita couldn't believe what all she heard. Then Vicky came in and sat down next to her dog, with tears in her eyes. \"Sorry, girl,\" Vicky replied tearfully while petting Rita, then giving her a hug. \"We have to give you away. Dad won't say why.\" Later that night (at midnight), Rita decided to run away, believing that she was a burden. She knew Vicky's father wasn't fond of her. After walking out through her custom-made doggie door, Rita looked up at the window that was Vicky's room. \"Goodbye Vicky,\" Rita said, with tears welling up. \"We-e had so-ome great ti-imes together! I'll ne-ev-er forge-et you!\" With her decision finalized, Rita turned around and ran off into the night. It took her a little over a week before she reached New York City. She spent at least the next two weeks scavenging for food, but it wasn't filling enough. This resulted in Rita becoming a little too skinny. (End of memory) Rita snapped back to reality and continued searching for food. This was becoming harder and harder and by the time she reached the boat docks, she collapsed. She was too weak from lack of food, but then a man came strolling by. \"Oh my,\" the man replied, with concern in his voice when he saw the saluki nearing starvation. \"You look all hungry, why don't come with me.\" The man picked Rita up and carried her over to his destination. With her eyes barely open, Rita saw the man was taking her to a boat. It turned out that this was the man's home, and he set Rita on a table to look over her. \"You poor girl,\" said the man. \"What's a dog like you doing all the out here?\" Rita also caught a brief glimpse of three more dogs resting nearby. \"So your name is Rita,\" said the man, looking at the collar. \"Where are your owners? Until they ever find you, I'll look after you. I need to buy some more dog food.\" After petting Rita, the man left his home. The three dogs got up to look over Rita. She saw that the dogs were made up of a mongrel, a great dane and a bulldog. \"Hello there,\" said the mongrel. \"I'm Dodger.\" \"I'm Francis.\" said the bulldog. \"I'm Einstein.\" said the great dane. \"The man who brought you here our owner, Fagin.\" \"Nice to meet you all,\" said Rita, in barely above a whisper. \"My name is Rita…\" \"I got some food!\" exclaimed another voice. \"Way to go, Tito,\" said Dodger. \"We have a guest here, in starvation it seems like.\" Rita saw that Tito was a chihuahua, and brought what looked like salmon or something. Tito gave Rita some of the salmon he brought back with him. \"Some of the fishies were jumping outta the water,\" said Tito. \"Our guest should have the first bite.\" \"Thank you very much.\" said Rita. She could only eat a little bit, since she barely had any food since running away. Tito left the barge again to see if he could catch some more fish. \"So Rita, why were you on the brink of starvation?\" asked Dodger. She told the other dogs (after Tito came back with more salmon) what happened three weeks ago. How she was close to being sent to a pound because the man wasn't fond of her, despite Vicky's protests. Dodger, Einstein, Francis and Tito were wide eyed in shock. \"How awful,\" said Dodger. \"Some man wanting to get rid of you because he didn't like you.\" \"I do feel sorry for the girl,\" said Einstein. \"She's probably all distraught now.\" \"Yeah, she and I enjoyed each other's company,\" Rita whispered. \"Running away wasn't easy, but I felt it would've made it easier if Vicky's father didn't have to go to all that trouble of taking me to a pound when I could just leave on my own.\" It took a month or so for Rita to get back to where she was prior to running away. She was accepted into the gang when they saw that she had some good sneaking skills, which became useful when getting food. Fagin waited a while longer to see if Rita's original owners would ever come looking for her. With no luck or hope of it ever happening, Fagin decided to keep Rita. \"Welcome to the gang, Rita,\" said Fagin, petting her. \"We can use all the help we can.\" Rita was happy to see someone else take her under their wing. But she never forgot those precious moments with Vicky (and never will), and that's something that she'll treasure forever. Maybe it was for the best that she left, but Rita knew that she'll still be there for Vicky in some way, even if she wasn't there physically. \"Good luck Vicky.\" Rita whispered as she fell asleep that night. The End! Author's note 2: It would be unlikely for Fagin to have stolen Dodger, Rita, Einstein, Francis and Tito. Fagin is normally seen as something like a petty criminal and stealing pets is at least a misdemeanor and a felony at worst. So Fagin more than likely found the dogs as strays and decided to take them under his wing. Why Vicky's father wasn't fond of Rita, I'm going to leave that up to you.

While many dogs would steer clear of the 'Underground', specifically being the metros and tunnels of the famed city, there were the vicious gutsy ones that controlled them and often resided within them. These types of dog-formed gangs were dangerous, hateful, and most of all, the true ugly face of New York City's nightlife. Butch, an Italian Shepherd, had lived here all of his life and absolutely loved it. Nothing better than working for what you've earned, he often told himself. His favorite red bandana had been a quick scheme he devised over a human family down in Brooklyn. Feigning being a stray looking for a home and getting a sweet accessory with it proved all that he needed to get out of there. Never lost it since, and never hated it. He's earned it. However, the city wasn't friendly to pampered dogs who had no collar around their neck, like he had tried to impersonate once, and welcomed the roughneck solo artists looking to make their greatest piece on the local vendor. Butch licked his lips, still tasting the salted pretzel he snagged a few short hours ago. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to stop his lingering hunger for the night. The coming-of-age sire smirked as the three other metro roaming dogs in front of him laughed as they told their greatest heists and recent exploits. \"Then- I grabbed his boot an' dat was dat! All I hatta' do was book it 'round tha corner, 'n it was history!\" The white terrier laughed, grime and dirt ruining his never seen before perfectly white fur. \"Tells us more, Richie! Tells us more!\" The shaggy dog to his left cackled, sounding like a hyena. The slim golden retriever to his right chuckled, eye crinkling. His left eye had been sown shut violently, and judging by the botched job and his lack of wanting to explain his puppyhood, it must've been without consent. Richie chuckled, using a paw to wipe at the tile they were all sitting on, next to the rails. \"Butch ova' here hasn't said a word all night. Ain't that right, Butchie?\" Butch grunted, showcasing a glossy row of sharp teeth and fangs at them. \"Nothin' ta note.\" \"You note nothin', man! Come on, ya gotta have somethin' that's interestin'.\" The shaggy dog reasoned. It was the same ritual with these two. Richie tells a good story, and then gets Quartz to start yapping at him about some imaginary story he never had. Screws watches from the side, never prodding or poking, but never stopping it. It was a cycle as old as time, and Butch couldn't change it. Quartz continued his yapping. \"Pretty please? You gotta have somethin', Butch!\" On any other day, he would've angrily snorted and gotten Quartz to shut his trap. Today wasn't like those days, rather. Like a water droplet hitting your nose on a sunny day, this was a rare occurrence and an exception to the norm. Butch smacked his lips, the ghostly taste of the pretzel still in the back of his throat. \"Alright, if it shuts ya up for a few weeks.\" The shaggy dog immediately stopped his yapping, sitting and looking Butch dead in the eye while Richie leaned in, invested almost immediately. Screws turned his head all the way over to Butch. \"Boutta few days ago, I found a vendor. Louie, he called hisself. Sells hot dogs 'n sausages in Manhattan, around Greenwich,\" Butch started. Quartz' tongue flopped out in eagerness, and Richie cocked his ear noticeably, urging him to go on. \"Gave 'im tha NYC Special. Looped through tha legs, takin' tha sausages 'n I booked it outta there. Too fat ta chase me.\" He smiled as he saw the building suspense for the three spectators drop instantly in disappointment. \"Man, you really don't got nothin', do's ya?\" Quartz dejectedly said. \"Story sucked, bro.\" Richie grunted, looking bemused. \"At least try ta make it interestin'.\" Screws blinked, his left eye twitching underneath the sown lid. \"I thought you actually had somethin',\" he said in a small grunt. \"Everyone's a critic,\" Butch closed, getting up to stretch. \"Gotta start lookin' fa dinner,\" he yawned. Finishing his nightly stretch, he started his way for the moldy staircase a minute's jog away. \"Have fun widdat,\" Richie called out after him, before quickly shutting Butch out to continue his over-the-top stories to a gullible Quartz and a careless Screws. The jog was a good wake up pill for the shepherd, who had felt sleepy after his small rest with his friends. It allowed him to clear his mind and get his blood pumping, something he always needed before doing anything, really. Before he knew it, the staircase was in his sights, guarded by two teenager dobermans. \"Butch,\" The pair growled out to the passing dog. The two were designated by the Sweepers, their gang, to guard this metro entrance. \"Stay safe, you two's.\" Butch nodded towards them. \"Bein' Trident's lapdog once a day keeps tha starvin' away, heh boys?\" \"Keep your mouth shut, Butch.\" The left one growled out viciously, not at all phasing Butch. Offering nothing but a smile in return, he jogged right by them, bounding into the bustling nightlife of New York City. Butch never would have guessed this routine decision would be a start of his life changing rapidly. Butch always ignored puppies. No if's, and's or but's about it. He'd even take their poorly scavenged food and tell them to try harder. He doesn't know if any had died because of his heartless thievery. He considered himself a tough reminder to the new kids that the world ain't fair, and there were many more like him awaiting them to stupidly walk in his turf. He hit the sidewalks of an unnamed street, not bothered at all by a single leaf, black as the night thanks to no light, swinging by him. It was as typical as ever, until he heard the shuffling of garbage to his left, into an alleyway he had no business looking at. He definitely didn't have any business with looking at what was in the alleyway, as that was suicide in most cases, and he definitely didn't have a sudden metaphorical spike hit his heart. Butch had denied healthy pups their taken goods, but never one that was so.. sick. Weak looking. The poor pup must've ate the wrong type of garbage. Especially in a dumpster. The off-white terrier puppy had a few brown spots on him, alongside a scruffy snout and a brown-topped head. He couldn't tell if it was from the fur color or the garbage he had been swimming in for the few past hours. The pup moaned in discomfort, whimpering as a few strange sneezes escaped his snout. Butch knew what he had to do. \"Mama..\" The kid muttered, tearing at Butch's regularly stone-cold heart strings. However, he wasn't that suddenly afflicted with the case of puppy sympathy syndrome. Butch responded with a gruffness to his voice. \"I ain't cha mudda, kid.\" Butch had a very great way with words. The puppy gave no answer, only burying his snout deeper into the bundle of dirty newspapers he pathetically attempted to move around to make a bed. Butch snorted, head cocking as he hopped up on the dumpster to sniff the kid. He definitely had a weird stench coming off him. Whatever the kid ate was not supposed to be eaten. He huffed as he gingerly moved his mouth over the back of the kid's neck. Clumsily, he lightly pressed his sharp teeth into the nape, slowly scraping the puppy up. The kid moaned in slightly discomfort, but once he was secured semi-comfortably in his grasp, he hopped down from the dumpster and headed off towards his den. He had no idea how to help the puppy, but he was going to at least try. Everyone in the city deserves a fair opportunity to be swallowed up by it. \"Quiet down, kid. We don't want company.\" Butch's voice muffled, but his intent clear all the same; Butch would make sure this kid had at least a chance. His paws scrapped against the sidewalk as he hopped over chained fences behind alleyways, surfed taxis down intersections and finally moved a discarded cardboard box from hiding a hole in the wall of a red, square building. The distant honking of cars and bright lights became muffled as he crawled through the small space, the puppy still in his grasp. A light at the end of the black crawl space greeted Butch, invigorating him to quicken his crawl. They reached the exit, finally popping into a small, dug out room. A bunch of dirty, old quilts and blankets stashed neatly in the corner greeted him. In the center, a single candle that was about half melted dimly lit the small room. He plopped the puppy down onto his bed of dirty quilts and blankets. He then crawled towards the entry of the crawl space and awkwardly dragged the cardboard box back over it, letting a small corner exposed to let the chilly air ventilate their room. Crawling back, he made his way over to the sick puppy, who was whimpering. \"Alright kid, whaddya want?\" Butch sat, staring down at the puppy. \"Food...\" He croaked in response, then sneezing. \"Food, food, food.\" Butch muttered. He stood up, pacing towards the crawl space. \"Stay 'dere, we don't need cha attractin' nobody.\" \"Okay,\" the puppy whimpered. Butch's natural scowl softened briefly, eyes blinking before he disappeared into the crawl space. The kid had to have a chance. Butch would make sure. 1989 Spring Where'd You Learn That, Big Brother? It had been another bustling day in New York City. Dodger had his fun snagging sausages off Old Louie, then stealing some flashy sunglasses off of another vendor a street down, dipping through the boroughs of New York and then swinging by Times Square on his way to meet Oliver at the Foxworth Residence. Car surfing in the street, hopping off on the sidewalk, and then brushing his way through the row of bushes covering the side of the residence, he hopped up on the open window's sill. With relative ease of pushing the window further up with his snout, he slid in and landed on the kitchen floor. Dodger gave a smug grin to no one in particular, looking back up at the window. Grabbing his sunglasses, he placed them on top his head as he strutted into the main staircase, making his way with a rhythm upstairs as a clueless Winston walked by below. Oliver had been enjoying his catnap, only to bustle to sudden consciousness when he saw Dodger slide into Jenny's room. \"Dodger!\" Oliver mewled happily, stretching before jumping down from the plush pillow on the window sill to meet his surrogate big brother. \"Hold tha applause, I know, I know. I'm too good at this whole 'gettin' in' thing,\" Dodger announced. Oliver rolled his eyes but nonetheless rubbed his head against Dodger's leg. \"It's been too long!\" Oliver meowed. \"I missed ya too, kid. Now relax before ya ruin my summer coat.\" Oliver stopped his greeting, kicking his head up at Dodger. \"How'd you get in?\" Dodger cocked his head towards the door way, smiling deviously. \"Tha kitchen's got a nice window. Never noticed it?\" Oliver smirked, shaking his head. He backed away from Dodger, standing a bit taller since he had grown, clearly trying to flash it off to Dodger. He caught the drift, but kept it nonchalant as he pretended to clean his sunglasses. \"Anythin' different with you, kid?\" Oliver stood up even taller, smiling proudly at him. Dodger kept his game going. \"You.. learned how ta sit taller,\" he intentionally poorly guessed. \"No, you silly! I got taller! Bigger!\" Oliver said, frowning. \"Wouldn't have noticed,\" Dodger said. \"Quit lying! Anyways, what brings you here, Dodger?\" Oliver questioned, settling back down on the window sill pillow. Dodger puffed his chest, strutting over to the wall, looking up at Oliver. \"Just stoppin' by ta see tha only cat I can tolerate.\" He gave a goofy grin at the smiling tomcat. Oliver blinked, smile fading slowly before he shook his head. He had been curious, after all. \"Say, Dodger. Speaking of learning.. where did you learn how to be a street dog? Or where to sing? Or where to play the piano?\" \"Learned how ta be a street dog from an old friend, and tha piano singin' from an even older friend.\" Dodger replied wistfully. This got a strange scrunched look on Oliver's face as Dodger replied. \"That's it? Who are these 'old friends'?\" \"That,\" Dodger adjusted his red bandana. \"Is a story for anotha' day, Ollie.\" Oliver readjusted himself, yawning. \"I got all the time in the world right now, Dodge. At least tell me about one of them!\" Dodger smiled, albeit a melancholic one. \"Alright.. alright, ya got me. I'll tell ya. First one was Butch. I'll get into dat in a few. Ya got any water around here? It's gonna be a long story, kiddo.\" ","Summary":" \"How'd ya manage ta do that, kid?\" \"I.. I don't know.\" \"You know what?

But yet, there was a feeling inside him. Someone he missed. His friends, Frances, Tito, Einstein and lovely Rita. But there was one dog; Dodger. The first ever dog to take him in. Ever since he met him, he felt like an older brother to him. Oliver felt bad because he wanted to tell him in the flesh that he was like one to him. Both dogs charged at each other. Oliver woke up in the middle of the night and felt he needed some air. He had a very lovely dream. He dreamed that Dodger had come to spend the night and he licked Oliver with affection and he treated Dodger to a relaxing belly rub as any dog would love. He dropped from his bed, walked to the cat flap, jumped through it and outside the porch. He inhaled the cool night air when his eyes fell upon a silhouette across the street with red eyes. Oliver wondered if that was Dodger. He followed the dog when he started to walk away. He pursued him through the dark streets, the street lamps buzzing and the wind singing in the night. Oliver followed the dog down to a familiar dock; Oliver knew at once for this to be the very place when he was endangered to that menacing Sikes man and his evil dogs who almost drowned him. The dog revealed himself as an evil-looking German shepherd glaring at him. \"Salutations, feast!\" Oliver watched in fright as it ascended but something else took him down. \"Don't you think cats are too furry to eat, dude?\" questioned a familiar voice. \"Dodger?\" \"The one and only,\" said the dig turning to him and winking. \"A dog your size?\" laughed the German shepherd. \"I'll take you down any day!\" \"Only one way to find out,\" said Dodger. The dog took Dodger to the ground, but he slickly rolled away from the bite that awaited him and he took the dog down the floor and pushed him into the dog. \"Wet nose means a healthy dog,\" smiled Dodger. The dog pounced at Dodger, taking him to the ground. Again, Dodger dodged only to get bitten savagely on the leg. But Dodger pounced straight onto him and bit his nose and scratched his side and the cowardly mutt ran for his life. As soon as the dog was out of sight, Dodger panted. Oliver ran up to him, concerned. \"You okay, kid?\" said Dodger looking very tired. \"I'm fine,\" responded Oliver, \"But you're hurt.\" \"Don't worry about me,\" said Dodger siting down. \"Just a scratch.\" \"I think I know a scratch when I see one,\" said Oliver shortly. \"You'd better come home with me.\" Normally, Oliver would enjoy a piggyback ride but now didn't seem the right time for it, seeing how badly Dodger was limping. Dodger climbed into Oliver's bed and rested comfortably as Oliver climbed in himself snuggling into Dodger's belly fur. It had been a long time since he had felt the warmth from Dodger. \"Thank you for saving me, Dodger,\" said Oliver, preening against his fur. \"My treat, pal,\" said Dodger. \"What were you doing out there anyway?\" \"I thought the dog was you,\" explained the kitten. \"You see, I missed you very much and I wanted to see you again.\" \"You missed me?\" questioned Dodger, a little flabbergasted. \"Because,\" said Oliver, \"I thought this for a while, but you're like my big brother, Dodger, even though you're a dog. But I do try to be one as well.\" And he attempted a few barks with only a few squeaks like a mouse Dodger couldn't help but smile at the inspiration he was for the kitten. \"Got the good makings of one, kid,\" smiled Dodger noogieng him. \"Only a dog with nine lives, who ever thought that?\" \"I know what will make you feel better,\" said Oliver. He nudged Dodger onto his back, clambered on top of him and began to rub his belly. \"Aw, no, kid! I'm too big for belly – belly ru – ru -\" He did not fancy the idea of having his belly rubbed, but immediately found that he rather liked it. He closed his eyes, relaxing and enjoying the massage the little kitten was giving him. Oliver on the other hand enjoyed the feel of his warm fur and laughed at the idea how it tickled Dodger and massaged him well. Soon, they feel asleep in each other's warm embrace, Oliver on Dodger's chest. Dodger had a dream that was strolling New York with the kid at his legs, teaching him all the tricks a dog, or in this case, cat needed to know. It felt good teaching things to a little brother figure. The next morning, Jenny came down to find the two friends asleep together. \"Georgette would love a new friend,\" she through to herself.

The bright light slowly graced over each occupant; the large, aging Great Dane, Einstein, asleep in his barrel, the beautiful brown Selki, Rita, in her open chest, and the small Chihuahua, Tito, and the Bulldog, Francis, asleep on the man's lap as he snored quietly. Then there was the intertube filled with ragged pillows and a blanket. This was where the terrier mutt, Dodger, slept. Oliver, the little orange kitten the mutt had befriended, slept there too curled up against Dodger's side. After the gang had rescued Oliver from the 'torture' of house life, the kitten had realized how much he actually loved the group of dogs. And it was more than the girl, Jenny. So he decided to stay. Yes, the houseboat was run down and most would call it a dump but, in the wise words of Dodger, when you got your pals, you got all you need. Fagin ended up paying off Sykes with Oliver's collar; the tag being pure gold satisfied the gangster and they were finally out from under the monster of a man when he 'disappeared' via the Maranzano/Bonanno mafia family. His vicious Dobermans, Rosco and Desoto, seemingly still living in the man's ship building. \"Dodger? Hey, Dodge, wake up.\" The terrier cracked one eye to see Oliver pushing his paws against his face. \"What is it, kid?\" he yawned. \"Come on, you said you'd show me the ropes today.\" The kitten jumped around on the pillows, clearly excited. Dodger looked around the houseboat. \"No one else is up, kid. It's too early.\" he replied, stretching out. \"But you said we would start at dawn.\" Oliver pouted. Dodger sighed. \"Yeah, yeah, okay.\" He smiled and rolled his shoulders cracking the bones. Oliver cringed; he hated that sound. Chuckling at the kitten's reaction, the terrier mutt shook himself fully awake and walked across the wooden floorboards to the stairs. \"You comin', kid?\" With a smile, Oliver ran after him only to have Dodger takeoff up the stairs and across the deck. \"Hey, no fair!\" \"What'd I tell ya, kid? Fairs are for tourists.\" The two ran up the trail of planks and onto the bay's main dock. Once on the dock, Dodger turned, expecting to see the orange kitten behind him, but saw nothing. Oliver was fast, he shouldn't have been more than a couple steps behind him. He waited for a moment before walking back to the edge and looking down. Nothing. Worry flooded the mutt's face; where was Oliver? Suddenly, something jumped onto Dodger's back causing him to panic, jumping back onto the dock. Then he heard it; the kid's laugh. Dodger stopped in his tracks and, with a smirk, rolled his eyes. \"What the heck are ya doin', kid?\" He turned his head to see the kitten giggling as he hung onto Dodger's signature red bandana. \"Just a little,\" Oliver cleared his throat and leaned his face closer with a smirk. \"Street savoire faire.\" Dodger rolled his eyes; he should never have taught the kid that. \"Alright, you scared me, now get off.\" The kitten did as he was told and started bouncing around in excitement. \"So, where do we go first? Park? Bowery? Maiden Lane?\" \"You're lucky I don't call the whole thing off for your little stunt.\" Dodger warned with a smile as the two made their way towards the buildings and, beyond them, the bright New York City. \"Hey, it was just some fun.\" Oliver defended. The mutt reached over and ruffled the kitten's fur playfully. \"First is some food,\" Oliver heard his stomach growl. \"Are we gonna get some of Ol' Louie's hot dogs?\" He asked, his eyes on the already bustling city. Dodger chuckled. \"Good suggestion, kid. Think you're ready to be chased again?\" \"If it means getting some of those franks, sure.\" The two didn't have to look long before the smell of sausages whiffed past their noses making their mouths water. Dodger pushed Oliver back gently with a paw as the, rather gross-looking, man pushed his cart by, humming his Italian opera. \"Okay, so it's Rita's turn to grab food for tonight. AKA, one sausage each.\" Dodge looked at Oliver and saw the, obviously, over-acting sad expression complete with the big, pleading eyes. Rolling his eyes shut, the mutt sighed. \"Fine, two each.\" He couldn't say no to the kid. He doubted anyone could if he pulled that face on them. Oliver perked up and smiled. \"Okay, Dodge, same as last time?\" The dog winked. \"You got it, kid.\" Once Louie stopped his cart, Dodger started barking and chased his little partner up to the man. Taking care of distracting Louie, Oliver ran across the man's face and shoulders, screeching until jumping off and following Dodger across the tops of cars. The mutt kept a close eye on the kitten till they reached the other side of the road. \"Nice job, kitty.\" He complimented, the two taking a rest on an abandoned couch in an alleyway. Still panting from the adrenalin rush, Oliver smiled at the compliment. \"Why am I the one who has to distract him? He smells awful.\" He scrunched his nose, enunciating the displeasure. Dodger chuckled, already tearing into one of the franks. \"Ya think I don't know? Before you came along, I had to do both jobs.\" \"Exactly! You know how bad it is! So why make me deal with it?\" Oliver argued, starting in on his food. \"Heh, fine, how does takin' turns sound?\" Dodger held out a paw for a five. Knowing the mutt's tricks, Oliver rolled his eyes at himself but went to five him. \"Deal.\" Surprisingly, the kitten's paw landed on the dog's bigger one. Dodge smirked at the kid's surprise. \"What? Ya gotta honor a deal.\" Oliver smiled and the two finished off their franks before taking to the streets again. Going down to the Park, they came across a gathering of people watching a street performer. Dodger turned to the orange kitten and smiled. \"Ready to be a 'cat burglar'?\" he joked with a smirk. \" \"Ha-ha.\" He rolled his eyes. Oliver hurried to a woman near the outskirts of the group who had placed her purse next to her. Taking a peek inside, the kitten noticed an upscale rosary, and even a pocket watch. Smiling, he backed away, taking care not to be seen and nodded to Dodger. The mutt sauntered up to the woman and started to rub against her, drawing her attention to pet him. The woman smiled and crouched down next to the dog, petting him. \"Aw, you're cute, boy.\" He sat on his hind legs and licked her cheek making her laugh. Taking the opportunity, the swift kitten swiped both the rosary and the pocket watch and hurried into a nearby tree. Sitting on a branch, Oliver held his head up, making sure Dodger saw he had gotten some items. Seeing the kid in the tree, the terrier gave the woman one last lick then took off down the street, Oliver leaping from tree to tree following until they were about a block away. \"Come on, kid, let's see whatcha got.\" Oliver worked his way down the tree and held up his catch proudly. \"Wow, nice job.\" Dodger was rather impressed; an expensive rosary and a good looking pocket watch. Setting the items in the grass Oliver's eyes lit up. \"Really?\" \"Absitively posolutely. Looks like you were born for this, kitty.\" Dodger nudged the orange cat playfully. \"Come on, let's get this back to Fagin.\" He grabbed the watch, waiting till Oliver grabbed the rosary before they ran off back to the docks. The mutt and kitten strolled down the dock and down the pathway to the houseboat. But two pairs of yellow eyes watched them. \"Why not take them now?\" \"Shut up; we need to keep their routine. Make sure the others ain't with 'em. Then we strike. Hehe.\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1: Showing Him the Ropes The sun's rays slipped through the cracks in the roof of the house"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Slander Songs","Author":"Bloodlustful","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904844","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Greetings, guys! I haven't written an Oliver And Company fanfic in some time, and that hugely tight schedule I've got? Well, I'm able to find a tiny hole here or there, and I've found one just now! Anyway, in this story, Georgette, having nothing else to do thanks to how Oliver is sleeping, Jenny is at school and the latter's parents have gone for an important meeting, decides that, despite how she never thought she'd see the day she'd do so, she'll experiment to see what it'd be like if she were to visit the gang of five who live in Fagin's barge with their owner, namely the aforementioned Fagin(who's had a long morning and is asleep at the time). After all, Oliver does it whenever he can, what with liking them, especially Dodger and Rita, and all, so she might as well just try it out once, though mostly because she'll otherwise be bored to tears. Of course, knowing Georgette, you can probably tell how it'll go, and as a way to try and settle matters that doesn't involve physical violence(despite how the gang dogs would love to do it, but ganging up on Georgette, and while Fagin's sleeping from a busy morning, no less, just wouldn't be right), Rita suggests that she and the poodle will both sing a song of their own choice and take turns, intent on using said songs to disrespect each other, and whoever hits the hardest with her disrespect is the winner, and which one wins will also determine what it all results in, of course. So you'll read of it all in this story, in which there are distortions of the song \"All Star\" by Smash Mouth and \"The Infection\" by Disturbed. NOTE WELL: This story takes place two weeks after the events of \"Oliver And Company\". I do not own any of the characters, as they all belong to the film mentioned above and as such to Disney, and I do not own \"All Star\" or \"The Infection\", since they belong to Smash Mouth and Disturbed, respectively(the latter is an excellent band, I should add, if you're into hardcore, dark rock kind of music, so to anyone and everyone who is, I recommend their songs). Slander Songs One day, when Jenny was at school, Winston was out with Jenny's parents for going to an important meeting of sorts(long story)and Oliver was sleeping like a log, Georgette's being the only one awake and active in the Foxworth mansion made her wonder what the hell she wanted to do, since she'd been doing her usual self-admiration, showing off and sashaying about well before any of these things were the case. Suddenly, she had an idea that she was shocked would cross her mind even for a second, but she couldn't help but wonder…Oliver had recurring visits to Fagin along with quintet of dogs, enjoying them all, but especially Dodger and Rita. Though she knew that she was well above them in every way(or at least she believed it, anyway), she was alarmed that she now realized that she wanted to see what it would be like if she paid a visit to them like Oliver did times aplenty. \"Just one, however.\" Georgette thought to herself. \"I can't believe I'm even considering this, but it's only to experiment how things would go down if it were me visiting that lot instead of Oliver. A one time only thing, and only because I've nothing else to do that I can think of at this moment.\" So, making sure that Oliver was as sound asleep as he looked(and he was, which meant that, chances are, he would be dead asleep like this until Jenny returned home, buying the poodle plenty of time to do her experimentation, return home herself and get cleaned up before he woke up, in addition to, of course, making sure she collected as little filth as possible for obvious reasons, plus Winston and Jenny's parents would be home a half hour or so after Jenny was, which she'd found out earlier), she made her way out of the mansion by going out onto that balcony and backed up as far as she could so that her running towards and leaping at a tree she saw would prove successful in getting her there. \"WHOA!\" Georgette exclaimed in her mind. \"Dammit, I should have considered what would, or in this case could, have happened to my perfect state if I did this, even doing all I could to avoid what dirt I collected during all of this, from this tree or otherwise! I was lucky, but now I have to be even more cautious and bit by bit kind of slow if I am going to maintain what I almost lost here and might lose just a little bit of while I do this, though I'll now more than ever minimize the chances of that as much as I can!\" So, after mentioning those intentions, she did just that, making sure that her perfectness would not be the least bit dirtied except for what tiny amount of that was inevitable by how she climbed down the tree, and once she was on the ground, she, after a little while, was able to recall which directions Oliver took whenever he was going to visit his past pals. \"Ah, splendid! Now to get going, because the sooner I'm done ending what I can't help but wonder and thus want to try out, the better.\" she thought to herself before taking off to where Fagin and his dogs lived, deciding she would stop when she was still on the sidewalks near their barge and wait until one or more of Fagin's dogs came out and saw her there. \"But they'd better not stall.\" Georgette thought to herself. \"I can only wait so fucking long until I say 'The hell with this crap' and go back home to clean up whatever I need to get cleaned off of myself.\" Luckily, one of them, specifically Rita, was coming out to look about the part of the city near their barge, feeling like some fresh air and lots of space, and she saw Georgette as she was coming out, prompting her eyes to fly open widely before she said: \"GEORGETTE! What a massive-ass surprise! Whatever the hell brings you here? Shouldn't you be busy looking in mirrors galore and bragging about how perfect you think you are?\" \"Har, har.\" Georgette replied, before saying: \"I'm actually just here to find out what it would be like if I visiting you and your gang along with your master instead of Oliver. There was nothing else to do back in the mansion, so I decided to suck it up and try to see what would happen for a one time only type thing. Want to bring the others out, or should it just be some girls only shit?\" \"Oh, I'll bring the others the fuck out. They wouldn't want to miss something like THIS. Wait'll they see you here instead of Oliver. Can you imagine their reaction?\" Rita said half sarcastically, half seriously. \"Yes, and I'd like to get it over with, thank you very much.\" Georgette told Rita, who then nodded and went to get the others, who at first didn't believe her, with Dodger saying: \"GEORGETTE?! SHE'S HERE WITHOUT OLIVER OR ANYONE ELSE?!\" \"YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO BE KIDDING US!\" Einstein let out, right before Francis said: \"ISN'T SHE ONE OF THOSE RICH GIRLS WHO DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER THINKING ABOUT THE LIKES OF US UNLESS SHE'S TOLD ABOUT IT BY OLIVER?! Finally, Tito, who was the most shocked of them all, let loose: \"UH-OH! I'M MOST LIKELY IN THE MOST TROUBLE OF ALL OF US JUST NOW, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED! TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE!\" \"No, it's true. I'm not kidding.\" Rita told them. \"Let's go out and see her. I don't think she plans to do this again anytime soon…actually, make that more than anytime ever. She came this far. If she can do that despite her obsession with perfection, we sure as hell can go out and greet her.\" \"All right, Rita. You've got a point there.\" Dodger said, looking to the other three and saying: \"Come on, guys. Let's get this over with, or, if we're lucky, enjoy it while we can.\" Everyone came out, and Dodger said: \"Hi there, Georgette. Fancy meeting you here.\" \"Likewise, Dodger.\" Georgette told him, and added in: \"Ah, and a certain someone's trying to hide from me behind big dope and fat boy, I see.\" She noticed how Tito was blatantly trying to keep concealed, but failing to do so despite being as small as he was, and he cracked a nervous smile, saying: \"H...H…Hi, Georgette. Long time no see.\" \"True, and I haven't forgotten how you ran the fuck out on me, just in case you were wondering.\" Georgette informed him before adding: \"You know, I've got to say, guys, I can see why Oliver, even being a kitten, can visit you so easily. After all, it's easy street for him…literally as much as metaphorically, the latter being in my beautiful mansion, of course. That said, it should be no surprise at all that I'm of that status, and, quite frankly, didn't even bother entertaining the thought of doing what I currently am for half a fucking second until I saw nothing else to do. You guys really do have it a lot harder than me, with or without your, I'll admit, adeptness concerning the streets of this city and such. I almost pity you all. ALMOST.\" She subsequently snickered, and Rita then remarked: \"You know, Georgette, I wouldn't be so fucking quick as to tell us how the hell you're on easy street in a literal sense, especially since we can get to the Foxworth mansion just as easily as Oliver, and, it apparently turns out, you, can get here. Metaphorically, yes, which I'll admit is more than can be said for the lot of us, but in case you've forgotten about our final showdown with Sykes, you might have helped out, but you really were a coward.\" \"A COWARD?!\" Georgette exclaimed, in absolute shock at what Rita had just, well, had the audacity to call her. \"Seeing as how you were paralyzed with shock and fear for so long during the time in which Sykes got his along with his two Doberman douchebags, I'd have to say…yeah. That's exactly what the hell you are.\" Rita nodded. \"Granted, the other ones of us were in a state of fright, too, but yours lasted longer than ours did.\" \"To the point where you were still immobile thanks to shock and fear even when Oliver turned out to be alive despite how it seemed he'd been killed and we all rejoiced.\" Dodger put in. \"Oh, and by the way…\" Francis put in. \"…I didn't appreciate your comments about my weight, Georgette.\" Furthermore, Einstein said: \"Or your calling me a dope.\" \"Okay, so it's what we should expect from you.\" Rita said. \"But we still don't like it, and I have a feeling you're trying to cover up the ignominious memory of that stilled, petrified state you were in before and your upset over Tito here running from you with such snooty talk.\" \"What nonsense!\" Georgette insisted. \"I'm not trying to cover up anything at all, least of all either one of the things you speak of. By the way, why hasn't Fagin come out here? Isn't he usually present whenever you guys are, here or otherwise?\" \"Yeah, but he's asleep right now. He's had a busy morning, you see.\" Dodger informed her. \"I'm guessing that, given how you're out here all by yourself and what you told us about being here before, Oliver's fast asleep and Jenny's at school right now.\" \"Along with Winston and Jenny's parents being out for an important meeting, yes.\" Georgette confirmed. \"Anyway, so far my experimentation as to how I'd like it if I went to see you instead of vice versa like Oliver does when it isn't the aforementioned vice versa? Why, it's making it clear to me that I'm only too smart not to and that it baffles me how he could possibly see anything in it. Wouldn't it be simpler for him to just stick to letting you guys come to see us like you do time after time? I know that's what I'd keep doing, especially given the way this is going. How I've managed not to burst out laughing all this time, I honestly have no idea.\" \"Funny you should say that…\" Tito said, suddenly mustering up the courage to speak to the poodle. \"…because we actually have no clue how we've been able to refrain from beating the living shit out of you during this, either.\" Georgette's eyes opened widely, and she looked to Tito, who then said: \"See, with the way we have to get everything for ourselves while you have everything handed to you, and with how you've got that 'my way or the highway' attitude despite how, on real highways, you're helpless and impotent, while we know them like the backs of our paws, it's amazing that you're not our punching bag all of a sudden.\" \"Wait a second!\" Rita shouted. \"Before you go at it with Georgette here, Tito, let's take the following things into consideration…despite how I'd like to dish out some punishment to Georgette myself like the rest of you would, let's take into account how it would make well more than enough noise to wake up Fagin, who'd have an even bigger problem than we would if he saw us ganging up on the prized poodle of the Foxworth family, which is saying something. Plus, let's face it, Georgette…do you really want to go through all that pain and then have to try and explain horrible injuries to Oliver when you get back home, plus inconvenience your owners due to needing a vet from said injuries?\" Realizing Rita had a point, along with Georgette, the other dogs nodded and then the poodle told Rita: \"I suppose I should thank you, all things considered, Rita. But let's face it…there is, although I'll admit I take the bulk of the blame for it, going to be some kind of clash here, and we've got to think of an alternative to what you guys wanted to do to me, though it's worth pointing out that, if you ganged up on me, I WOULD fight back, regardless of how well I could or couldn't do so.\" \"Maybe said alternative can be a song related contest.\" Rita suggested. The other dogs, Georgette or otherwise, looked at her with confusion, and she explained: \"Before Oliver was found by Jenny, I was teaching him street related matters along with my pals here.\" She motioned her nose towards the other four members of the gang she was Dodger's second-in-command of to emphasize and continued: \"I sang him a song that should be called 'Streets Of Gold' while we did so.\" \"Really? You did?\" Georgette asked, amazed, and Rita nodded, while Dodger added: \"Believe me, she's not lying. We simply did our part while Oliver did his, as well, but she accompanied her part with that song, which, by the way, was excellent, dear.\" \"Thank you, love.\" Dodger was told by his girlfriend before she turned to Georgette and asked: \"Tell me, Georgette…did you, by any chance, have a song of your own, at any point?\" \"As a matter of fact, I did.\" Georgette answered, subsequently explaining to Rita: \"I called it 'Perfect Isn't Easy', referring to how I constantly do all I can to maintain what is required of me, given my sort of lifestyle, all while I did my routine of every morning, of course. As you might have guessed, I'm a solo act with it who sings it whenever doing said routine. It all comes with being the sort of prizewinning show dog I am.\" \"I see.\" Rita told her. \"Well, I'm glad to hear it, because, see, despite how we'll obviously make noise in so doing, Fagin sleeping as heavily as he is ensures that it won't wake him up should we have the sort of thing I'm thinking up for settling matters, and it'll most likely buy you enough time to get back home afterwards so that you can make it as if you were never gone for this little experiment of yours, which, by the way, would have been blown if it were a real experiment like some human scientists perform.\" \"I suppose you are right.\" Georgette said to her. \"But what is it you're thinking up for said matter settling, anyway, Rita?\" \"Simple.\" Rita answered. \"You've been very disrespectful to us, indeed, and this spurs me to make it so that you and I sing a song apiece, one at a time, that disrespects the other, the idea being that whoever does the better job with disrespecting her opponent either earns the right to keep being bitchy and gloat about how she proved herself superior to us even when she descends from on high to interact with us, if you win, or puts the one who's been behaving less than politely in her place while also showing her own kind of superiority and teaching the one who's been so condescending a lesson, should I win. What's ironic is, I've got my vices along with the other four here and am somewhat bitchy myself, plus a thief, just like they are while you aren't, but you're still above me in vices and bitchiness nonetheless. So let's see if you're above me in disrespect song talent, as well.\" \"You know, that sounds awesome! Great job thinking up that idea, Rita!\" Dodger said, and after Rita said: \"Thanks, Dodgie!\" Tito put in: \"Si, I agree! The best solution possible, in fact!\" \"No argument here!\" put in Francis, and Einstein added: \"I can't see any downside to this at all!\" \"You're on!\" Georgette said to Rita, also having agreed to the insult song contest as how the problem would be solved, as signified by these words. \"I go first, though.\" \"Why not?\" Rita said. \"After all, what better way to burst your overinflated bubble of an ego than to outdo you after you seem to have proven to be the best?\" \"You're gonna gag on that remark, Rita.\" Georgette told her, \"especially since, as you said seconds ago, you're no fucking saint yourself.\" and she looked to Dodger, Francis, Einstein and Tito, and asked: \"Everyone ready like Rita here is?\" They nodded, and Georgette said: \"Okay, then! It's time to be a perfect champion singer now as the next thing that makes me the best there's ever been!\" Georgette, after grinning nastily at Rita with much malice in her eyes, started singing away with the following tune to what she sang as she referenced her lifestyle being much easier and safer than Rita's, as well as how she was the one who was the Six Time National Champion and didn't need to steal to live. \"I'm the most perfect dog in all of New York City and don't need larceny to be fed! The truth really hurts, especially for Rita and her friends who must just now be seeing much red! No one can beat me! I just keep right on coming! Rita is nothing and I am quite something! She is dirt poor while I'm stinking rich! I'm perfect, too! You can't deny it! Don't try to compare her to me! She constantly explores filthy streets! She and her friends live and feel low! All while the praise I get does glow! I'm truly an all-star! So much talent and fame! The Six Time National Champion I am named! My medal's always gold, while Rita's got one filthy coat! A cool poodle! I am one! Which is well-known! The one who takes the top spot is me alone! Rita is only a bottom feeder, always stealing what she's wanting and/or needing! The things she'd gone through I have never been! It's in the lake, not the dock water, I can swim! I'd hate to have it as bad as her! Perfect isn't easy, but she'll be it never! I'm truly an all-star! So much talent and fame! The Six Time National Champion I am named! My medal's always gold, while Rita's got one filthy coat! OH, YES, YES, I AM SO GREAT! OH, YES, YES, I AM SO GREAT! OH, YES, YES, I AM SO GREAT! OH, YES, YES, YES, YES, I AM SO GREAT! I'm truly an all-star! So much talent and fame! The Six Time National Champion I am named! My medal's always gold! I've no filthy coat! Rita never asks for what she wants, she just gets a hold of it and then swiftly runs away! Oh, yes, yes, she is a bitch, even if I'm more of one myself! But her kind of game I'd never play! No one can beat me! I just keep right on coming! Rita is nothing and I am quite something! She is dirt poor while I'm stinking rich! I'm perfect, too! You can't deny it! Don't try to compare her to me! She constantly explores filthy streets! She and her friends live and feel low! LOW! All while the praise I get does glow! GLOW! I'm truly an all-star! So much talent and fame! The Six Time National Champion I am named! My medal's always gold, while Rita's got one filthy coat! My medal's always gold, while Rita's got one filthy coat! \"Whoa, that sure as hell was quite something there, Georgette!\" Dodger exclaimed, and Tito said: \"Si! I'll admit that, despite obviously liking Rita better for obvious reasons, this sort of singing talent and creativity makes it so that I almost want to get back with you despite the bath incident and how loudly and blatantly you derided me and my amigos during this visit. ALMOST.\" \"Well, it sure doesn't surprise me that any of the things these guys just said are so,\" said Georgette to Rita, \"and I especially like the part where your boy toy here…\" She motioned her nose towards Dodger for emphasis, and continued: \"…said that it was quite something, and of course where the little guy…\" Pointing her nose at Tito, also to emphasize, she kept talking: \"…gave my, as he put it, singing talent and creativity such commendation and applause. And all I now have to say about it myself is…\" She looked right in Rita's direction and said to the saluki: \"Beat THAT, Rita.\" \"You'll be shocked when I do,\" Rita told Georgette, throwing the poodle's trash talk back in her face with some of her own, \"and this would be the case even if you WEREN'T such a coward in the face of danger!\" \"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" the other dogs went in unison, and Georgette gaped at what Rita had just said to her, how she dared to call her a coward again, right before Rita grinned venomously at the literal rich bitch and also had a lot of malevolence in her eyes(it was comparable to the amount of malice Georgette had shown in her eyes to her before, in fact). And this was where Rita kicked her song off, with the lyrics and tune being a little bit scarier(okay, a lot scarier)than which ones of those Georgette had used. \"Despite being vain and cocky, Georgette would be helpless if she were, by late evening, outside of the big mansion she resides in! On Fifth Avenue alone at night and not in her home, she couldn't possibly hide from those who'd want to end her life! All while too scared to even try to escape what street dogs would cause and laugh at her demise! By herself she'd not survive on the road! She would die! One or more alley dogs would eat her alive! Without our help, she'd die! Georgette is a pathetic bitch, terrified easily and her incredibly damn vexing pride is something that angers the likes of us who all must fully know the mean streets we often call home! When on her own in the dark, something will real soon stop her heart! After all, she fears even the slight, remote kind of threats, and the worst threats would cause and laugh at her demise! Without aid, she'd not survive here! Indeed, she would die! Likely by vicious street dogs eaten alive! Alone downtown, she'd die! She is such a sissy! Street life she couldn't survive! Unlike us, she would die! On them, we can all easily stay alive, but Georgette would just die! She would be badly flatlined in no time! Very horribly die! Become a poodle pie! Meet her end on these streets of yours and mine! Downtown demise! This fucking wuss would die! Weakling Georgette would die!\" \"WOW!\" exclaimed the other dogs in unison while Georgette was so aghast that she was unable to move, both because of how much more intense Rita's choice of disrespect song was and because of how there was an excellent chance that her saluki competitor had come out triumphant, along with how the song had scared her so(which was part of why said excellent chance of Rita winning existed just now). And sure enough, Dodger said to his gal pal: \"Damn, Rita, I have GOT to tell you…Georgette might have really been awesome, but you've just gone well beyond phenomenal in the strongest sense of that set of words! You…you win, and I'd be saying this and glad about it even if you weren't my girlfriend!\" \"Oh, yeah, no question about that, amigo!\" Tito told Dodger, and after saying: \"Way to go, Rita!\" he looked to Georgette and said: \"Now, then, I do believe you said something about your having an easier lifestyle putting you above the lot of us, me, Rita, Dodger or otherwise?\" \"I…I…\" Georgette began, but then she decided that, if she was to maintain any of what she'd now lost a great deal of(her dignity, pride and perfection status, that is), she would at least take the loss with the aforementioned dignity, telling Rita: \"Well, I admit that you did a lot better than I thought you would, Rita, although this doesn't change the fact that my lifestyle is better. Still, after today, it's pretty clear that maybe I should just stick to dog shows, winning what sort of contests I perform in and such. At least as far as competition goes, anyway. I'm amazed that I'm able to stay so calm when I'm this embarrassed.\" \"Well, you're showing some good strength of character in taking your loss with dignity and managing said calmness, so that's something to be praised for. Still, you wouldn't want Oliver to know about this, so I would advise you to, should you see one or more of us again, not do things like laugh about how we live or gloat about how there are, I admit, a lot of things that you can afford that we can't.\" Rita informed her. Georgette nodded sheepishly before Rita added on: \"Because otherwise, I tell him all about this, and how it signifies that us hard working, scraping to get buy barge residing dogs are far stronger than you when push comes to shove, especially as far as courage is concerned, given your having everything handed to you on a silver platter all the time and unused to what happens outside of your house, which is part of why you're easy to scare, and he'll lose the battle every time he sees you and thus has to try not to laugh, which he'll always do but never succeed in. After all, he's never given it any thought, but if he does, that and how he remembers he did surprisingly well when he had to be part of our sort of thing, and better than you did, it'll only add to his inability not to laugh every time he looks in your direction despite how he doesn't want to make fun of you and is as sweet, kind, innocent and pure as he is.\" \"All right, all right. I get the picture.\" Georgette said. \"Maybe, if I'm feeling nice enough and my owners will allow it, you guys can visit my mansion and play with Oliver sometime or other. No promises, though. Anyway, I'm going back home before Jenny gets back from school and/or Oliver wakes up. I don't want any of them to get worried about me, and this would be so even if I hadn't grown to like Oliver well enough over the past week or so, especially given how he has been wanting to be friends with me from the beginning I had to tolerate him being my housemate forward.\" The others nodded and Georgette took off, doing what she could to block out how much she hated having lost to Rita and indeed tripped at the finish line, though how upset she was about it was lessened by how, while Rita's disrespectful lyrics certainly made her mad, she'd also, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, pissed Rita off with her insulting lyrics. When Georgette got home, she was glad to see that Jenny hadn't returned from school yet and Oliver was still asleep, so she just cleaned herself up and made sure to do so in a way so that, once she was finished, she was certain as hell that there'd be no hints that she'd taken the trip she did, on her body or otherwise, subsequently going into her room and laying down on the bed next to the sleeping Oliver. After that, she looked up to the ceiling while knowing that, despite how she dreaded even the thought, there would be a time in which Einstein, Francis, Tito, Dodger and, of course, Rita would be visiting the place, possibly(though only possibly)after finding a better life and home than the one they currently lived and resided in, respectively(not to mention that, very obviously and predictably, she regretted trying her little experiment in the first place, given what results it produced, and was glad that she'd never make that mistake again, only seeing the other dogs, with or without Fagin, in the same kind of instances that had been the case before from now on). \"Note to self…\" she said in her mind. \"Try and escalate the amount of courage you've got so that you won't be frightened by what goes on in the streets and might be able to try a few of the street dog gang's tricks so that they no longer have that way of looking down on you, an ironic fact, since you've looked down on them for so long about so much. And furthermore, do NOT give any signs of the embarrassment you currently feel to anyone. Ever. Especially Oliver. He's been good to you and you've come around to him, at least to some extent, anyway. Don't derail that, or destroy your self-esteem in the process, by telling him something that will make it impossible for him not to laugh and therefore enrage you to the point where you hate him more than ever, which, ironically, will be your own damn fault. Ah! Sounds like Jenny's returned and looks like Oliver's waking up just now! So focus on something else unless you want to lose what you have left, Georgette.\" As Oliver yawned and woke up and Jenny came into the house and, since her parents were still out in that meeting, simply did what she had to do and went up to see her pets after she did so, the poodle knew that neither would see anything different about her, so it would be easy to block what had happened a matter of minutes ago out of her mind, and thus, things wouldn't get any worse as long as she did things accordingly, which she would, since she might have been arrogant and she might have been cowardly, but she was not stupid. THE END Did you guys like it? I hope it was as entertaining for you as I intended. Quite the mood swing, too, with the songs chosen, the order they were done in and how Rita's punished Georgette for the less than respectful way that she acted during that visit in such a dark, scary and intense way, huh? Ratings and reviews, please! ","Summary":" Greetings, guys! I haven't written an Oliver And Company fanfic in some time, and that hugely tight"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"You and Me","Author":"Emperor Andross","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12548329","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The house was silent. New York was never silent, a constant parade of colour, a cacophony of sound, that was the city which never sleeps. And yet, somehow, the city today seemed quiet. Muted. As if it was holding its breath. Oliver stood up briefly and stretched, before walking over the kitchen counter to stare out the window, seeing the same quiet ally as ever and resignedly pattering back to his bed on top of the fridge and once again curling himself into a ball. There had been noise in the morning. The normal sounds of the city swinging into full production, taxis loudly complaining to each other in their familiar but indecipherable honking, planes rumbling by every few minutes and cars passing in the street. All the sounds that a native to New York hardly noticed. Oliver had been far more interested in his breakfast: some cold chicken from the previous night, and then Jenny had been wishing him goodbye as she left for university. Just as had happened every day for the past year since Jenny had moved out of her home on Fifth Avenue and bought this apartment for them. But then, not much later, things had changed. Noises which Oliver had never heard before in his thirteen years of life. A great 'boom' louder than any car backfiring he had ever heard. It had shaken the building, scaring him away from the rattling bay window which looked out onto the street in front. A little while later, a second boom, had chased him out of the living room for good — into the familiar comfort of the warm kitchen, with his bed and the familiar comforting sense of Jenny. He had not been brave enough to venture back. Initially there had been a frenzy of activity outside which had outweighed even the normal post-peak period as he heard cars racing up and down the street and sirens off in the distance. Then a noise which sounded like an earthquake. Or perhaps a large train going by. Either way it had been quiet since then. There had been clouds of dust at once point, but that had long since settled, leaving Oliver alone in the kitchen, waiting. The person he most wanted to see was Jenny, but she was not due home for hours yet. Instead, he had hoped that Toby would stop by and tell him exactly what had been happening in the city all morning. Toby was Oliver's favourite of Dodger's sons, and certainly the most reliable. While Charley and Nancy were friendly enough, they were frequently away, and Noah brought along an air of visiting only under extreme sufferance. Toby on the other hand, looked up to 'Uncle Oliver', and frequently dropped around to keep him up to date on the word on the street while he would, in turn, recount the interesting stories of Jenny's television. Still, while the lack of Toby did not necessarily mean anything was amiss, it certainly did not allay his fears any. Suddenly, breaking the silence, Oliver raised his head at the sound of the front door unlatching. Springing to his feet, he again stretched out his middle aged body and leapt down to the counter top and then to the floor, skittering into the entrance hall. Never mind that it was hours too early, Jenny was home. \"Mraow?\" enquired Oliver, wondering just what was happening out there. Jenny was very rarely home early, certainly not without seeming to be a little sick in the morning. \"Oh, Oliver.\" cried Jenny, latching the door before sweeping him up into a hug and clutching him desperately to her chest. She was tense and smelled of smoke and dust, the normal scents of her clothes partially masked by the new acrid smells. Oliver set aside his own worries for the moment, and purred, curling up into her; knowing that it always made her feel better. \"Oh, kitty.\" she sighed, stroking behind his neck, \"It's so awful.\" \"Meow?\" asked Oliver again, looking up into her face. Jenny slowly walked into the living room in a daze and absently turned on the lights before sitting down in the soft armchair, clutching her cat to her as tightly as she dared. Oliver, meaning to find out exactly what was happening, reminded her of his question with a slight bump of his nose to her chin. \"I can't believe it, Oliver.\" Tears began to glisten in her eyes now, slowly dripping down her cheeks, \"Oh, poor mister Fagin. Poor all of them.\" Oliver did not know what to say. One did not need to be Einstein, er, or perhaps Francis—may they both rest in peace—to know what had happened. Oliver would miss the old deadbeat. He had taken a shine to Jenny, and though it had taken him ten years to do it, he had cleaned up his act and gone into a legitimate career of investment banking. And through it all, he had been good old 'Uncle Fagin', there for her, when her parents could not be due to their work commitments. Why, only a few years ago, he had been the one to look after Oliver when Jenny went off to college. Not that her parents would not have, of course — but they were both still frequently away, and old Winston was not as young as he once was. Oliver raised his head and rubbed it against Jenny's face, making her giggle slightly despite her sadness. \"Oh, Oliver. Thank you.\" she said, \"you do always know how to make me feel better, don't you?\" She sighed. \"At least Dad wasn't there. I guess there are some advantages to always travelling for work, huh, puss?\" Her lip trembled again. \"I should ring him.\" she said, \"I mean I'm sure that Mom has already, but he's probably still worried...\" despite her words, she made no effort to get up, instead lowering her head and nuzzling Oliver's ginger fur. \"Oh, kitty, everything is so different now. I was so scared today, I didn't know what was happening... I still don't! Why is this happening?\" The young woman's shoulders began to shake as her words were muffled by Oliver's fur. \"...together, that's you,\" She sang softly, \"forever with me,\" Oliver flicked his ears back; recognition of years past playing on the piano as a little girl showed him the first genuine kindness of his life. Just as that same girl had hugged him during the terror of thunderstorms and trips to the vet, he snuggled with her, lending her his comfort as spots of moisture began to land on the fur on the back of his neck. \"...we'll always be good company, you and me, yes together we'll be.\" AN: I just discovered Oliver and Company, and was charmed especially by the relationship of Oliver and Jenny. I wrote this in about an hour, so I'm not sure how good it is really, but I thought I should post it before it got relegated to some distant corner of my hard drive. In case it's not already obvious, this is Jenny of around about 20 (I'm assuming that she was no older than 7-8 in Oliver and Company since she can't read) returning home after being in Manhattan during the 11th Sep 2001 terrorist attacks.

New York was never silent, a constant parade of colour, a cacophony of sound,"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Killer on the Road","Author":"DeanFan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052458","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Don't own House of Wax Author's Note: I sat in silence riding in the passenger seat of my older brother Wade's car. Music was playing softly as I looked out the scenery. We were on our way to meet up with Wade's girlfriend Carly and her friends. You want to know why the reason why me and my brother aren't speaking at the moment? He found out that I have been secretly dating Carly's brother Nick. Wade found out when he found Nick in my room when our parents were out of town. Of course they a huge fight and since then they've hated each other more. That was a month ago but Nick and I started dating one month prior to the incident. Now as a peace offering for Wade I'm riding with him to a game. Wade broke the silence first. \"How long do you expect to hide this from everyone,\" Wade asked not taking his eyes off the road. \"What do you care? You hate Carly's friends anyways,\" I said looking at him. \"I don't even know what Nick and I are. It just happened between us.\" Wade snorted. \"Like I'm supposed to believe that,\" He said. \"Remember when I first met Nick I hated him as much as you did or still do,\" I said. \"I think Nick was more surprised than any of us,\" I said with a smile. \"Because the guy has feelings,\" Wade said protective of me. \"All Nick does is gets into trouble and blames everyone else for his mistakes. What if he does that to you and it goes too far?\" I looked at Wade in shock. \"Nick has never hit me,\" I said folding my arms. \"Besides you of all people know I would not stay with a guy that was abusive.\" \"I know. I'm just worried about you. I don't want anything bad to happen to you,\" He said. \"The only thing bad I think is going to happen on this trip is if we hit too many curvy roads I'll get car sick or you and Nick might kill each other.' 'Just promise me one thing.\" \"What?\" I asked as he pulled into a parking lot where everyone was. \"You are not sleeping in the same tent as Nick.\" I laughed. \"Your sharing a tent with his little sister. How do you think he feels?\" \"Nothing,\" He said turning the ignition off and getting out. I got out of the car and followed. One thing I wasn't sure was how we were all supposed to fit in Wade's 'man car'. \"There's my boyfriend,\" Carly said with a smile as we walked up to the table. \"Hey babe,\" Wade said giving her a kiss. I rolled my eyes and looked away. I was scanning the area to see if Nick was here. The only reason why Nick came was because of me. I just wasn't looking forward to Dalton's camera in my face the whole time. Carly's friend Paige spoke. \"Emma, I'm surprised you came.' \"Why,\" I asked looking at her. \"Well I know you get car sick,\" She said. \"I think I'll get sick from the trip anyways,\" I said making Carly laugh. I smiled a little. \"At least someone thinks I'm funny.' \"We better figure out the riding arrangement,\" Paige said getting down to business. \"Well I figured that me, Emma, and Dalton could ride with Wade,\" Carly said. Paige made a face. \"What about, Nick?\" Everyone else had the same look on their face. I didn't blame them. Nick could make your life miserable if he wanted to. \"We flip,\" Wade suggested. I stood up. \"While you guys decided I'm going to grab some snacks for the road. Does anyone want anything,\" I asked. \"We already got our stuff,\" Paige said. I rolled my eyes. \"Wade?\" \"Surprise me,\" He said. I walked off inside the store. \"Surprise me,\" I muttered as I walked down the junk isle. When I walked in I noticed a homeless guy sitting by the door. Whatever I have left I'll give him some. I grabbed some chips, soda, and candy before going to pay for it. After I paid for my purchase I walked outside in time to see my idiot boyfriend being mean to the homeless guy. I gave Nick a dirty look behind his back and gave the homeless guy a $10.00 bill and a bag of chips. Nick and Dalton was sitting where Paige was. I decided to sit next to Wade. As usual Dalton had the damn camera pointed at me. \"Dalton, I told you before if your camera breaks while filming me it's not my fault,\" I glared into the lenses. Dalton looked scared and turned it off and Carly laughed. \"So did you guys figure out the riding arrangements,\" I asked. \"I just know Blake isn't going to want me riding in his truck if I get car sickness.\" Carly smiled. \"Dalton is going to ride with Blake and Paige,\" She explained. I smiled sweetly. \"Good. That means they get to deal with Dalton's camera.\" \"Hey,\" Dalton said in offense. Nick glared at Wade who glared back. \"If you two are going to fight I'll ride in the back of Blake's truck.\" \"I didn't say anything,\" Nick said glaring at me now. Wade looked at Nick with hate at the way Nick was looking at me. \"Guys can't we at least be civil during the trip,\" Carly asked annoyed. \"Says the one talking,\" Nick said looking at her. She flipped the paper that she was holding over angry. \"You got something to say to me?\" \"No, I think you said enough,\" Nick said. I stood up as did Dalton. \"I'm going to go beg Blake to ride with him,\" I said storming off. I wasn't in the mood to listen to them bicker and neither was Wade. I spotted Blake's truck and walked over to the driver's side. \"Blake, can I please ride with you,\" I begged him. Blake chuckled. \"Carly and Nick getting into it,\" He asked. \"Yes. I don't want to hear them bicker the whole way.\" \"Okay. You can ride with me but if you throw up in my truck your cleaning it up,\" He said. \"I promise,\" I said. \"So this means Dalton your riding with Wade after all,\" Blake said happy about the camera not being there. Wade didn't look happy being stuck with Nick and Dalton. \"Thanks man,\" Wade said walking back over to where Carly was. \"Should we get going,\" Paige asked. \"LETS MOVE!\" Blake yelled. A/N: This is my first House of Wax story so please be gentle. Reviews please![Chapter 2] We were on the road for an hour now and I was bored out of my mind. I sat in the back seat of Blake's truck reading a book or trying to but gave up when I couldn't see the words from being dark out so I tossed the book aside. Paige looked at the review mirror on the right side and smiled. \"They haven't killed each other yet,\" She said. \"I find that hard to believe,\" Blake said keeping his eyes on the road. \"Emma, can I ask you something,\" Paige asked. \"It depends,\" I said. \"Do you think Wade's going to move to New York to be with Carly?\" I sighed. I didn't want to talk about my brother's business. \"I don't know, Paige. It's not my place to talk about it.\" \"He'd be a damn fool not to follow,\" Blake said. I heard something drop on the floor. \"Damn it,\" Paige muttered looking down. \"What,\" I asked. \"I dropped my lip balm. Can you help me find it?\" \"I don't want her moving in my truck. She might throw up,\" Blake said worried about his truck more than me. How sweet was he? \"Babe,\" She whined. \"Fine,\" He said. Paige bent down and I just pretended to look. I didn't care about something stupid as that especially since I knew they only put up with me because their friend was dating my brother. But as stupid as I was I glanced down on the floorboard and saw it by Blake's foot. \"It's by Blake's foot,\" I said. \"Blake, move your foot,\" Paige complained. Blake moved his foot a little and Paige bent down. I tried not to laugh from what it looked like from the back seat. Apparently I wasn't the only one that noticed. I heard Wade's horn honking and everyone yelling in surprise and shock. I looked at Wade's car and saw Nick sitting behind Wade. Then Paige's phone rang. \"I dropped my lip balm,\" Paige said holding it up to show them. \"Babe, do we keep driving or find a place to crash for the night,\" She asked Blake. \"I found a short cut,\" Blake answered. \"Just have them follow us.\" Paige told them on the phone and hung up. \"I can't believe they thought I was giving you a blow job,\" Paige said irritated. \"Well it didn't help that Blake was making happy faces,\" I said with a smirk as he drove into a clearing. The truck pulled to a stop and I hurried up and jumped out to stretch my long legs which were cramped from riding in the back seat. \"Are you going to help us unload,\" Blake asked me. \"I'm stretching for a minute,\" I told him. Blake didn't care of course since I was taller than him by a couple of inches. I was 5'10 where as Wade was 6' something. I walked to the back of the truck and started unloading stuff. No shocker there. Nick was just sitting on his ass watching everyone while drinking. I could feel his eyes on me as I was helping Wade set up a tent. After we got his and Carly's up we went to help the others. About an hour later everything was set up and I was sitting next to Carly drinking water watching the guys throw a football around; except Nick of course. \"Have you talked to Wade,\" Paige asked Carly. \"We're just in different places right now,\" She said. I spoke up breaking my rule about talking about my brother's business. \"He loves you Carly,\" I said. \"I guess he's afraid that with you taking the internship things might change.\" She smiled. \"I love, Wade. I'm not doing anything wrong.\" \"I know your not. He's just not good with changes,\" I said. All of a sudden we heard Wade and Nick arguing. I rolled my eyes where Carly looked frustrated. \"It never stops,\" She said. We both stood up and ran over to them. I tried pulling Nick back as Carly was with Wade. \"I can't believe your standing up for him,\" Wade accused me in front of everyone. \"Wade,\" I hissed at him. \"You know what? I don't care anymore,\" Wade said angry. \"You want to waste your life with a punk like him. Go ahead!\" he yelled at me storming off. Everyone looked at me and Nick. I don't know if it was shock or surprise but I couldn't look at them. I ran where the trees were at embarrassed and crying. Maybe Wade was right. I wasn't sure why I was with Nick anymore. I jumped up when I felt a hand on my shoulder and saw that it was Dalton. What surprised me was he didn't have his camera on at the moment. Also I hated the look on his face; Sympathetic look that I've never seen Dalton use before. I realized I must have looked awful for him to be looking at me like that. I wiped the tears off my face with the back of my hand. \"Are you okay,\" Dalton asked. I scoffed. \"Did Nick send you to do his dirty work?\" \"Nah besides I'd be use to it. I clean up shit for a living remember?\" I laughed. \"True. That means you don't have any trouble putting up with Nick then.\" Dalton frowned. \"This is weird.\" I nodded in agreement. \"It is.\" He was referring to us being alone because that never happens. \"Thanks for being a good friend, Dalton.\" He had a goofy look on his face now. \"I just might die happy.\" I shook my head in amusement and saw Nick now next to me. \"I'm sorry,\" Nick said. \"I'll leave you two alone,\" Dalton said going back to the camp site. \"Sorry doesn't cut it anymore, Nick. Why are we together because clearly your not happy,\" I snapped. \"Well if your idiot brother hadn't ratted us out in front of everyone-\" He started yelling angry. \"Real nice, Nick,\" I yelled. \"All you do is blame everyone else for your problems. Grow up! Everyone on this trip has tried to be civil with you and you don't even care! So screw it! I'm done Nick. I'm not doing this anymore,\" I said trying to walk back to the camp site but he grabbed my arm hard. \"I don't want to lose you. You're the only good thing in my life,\" He said softly letting my arm go. \"You don't act like it,\" I said going back to the camp site. Unknown to us they heard are yelling match at the camp but when we walked up they were acting like they didn't know a thing. But I did notice that Dalton was dressed like Elton John. Did that happen when Nick and I were fighting? \"Looking good, Dalton,\" I said making them laugh. All of a sudden a truck pulled into the clearing by the trees with bright headlights pointed at us. \"What the hell,\" Blake said angry covering his eyes from the light. \"Maybe we're on his property,\" Carly suggested. \"We didn't even pass the gate,\" Wade explained. \"Could you turn off your lights,\" He yelled. The truck just stayed their. \"This is creepy,\" Paige stated the obvious. All of a sudden Nick picked up a beer bottle and hurled it at the truck breaking a headlight. \"Nick,\" Carly yelled shocked. Nick just stood their facing the truck before it backed up with its one headlight. \"What,\" Dalton yelled trying to be bad. The truck disappeared. \"What the hell was that,\" Carly asked grapping Nick's arm. \"It's gone isn't it,\" Nick demanded before returning to his chair. I walked up to Carly. \"Don't take it personal.\" \"I'm not. I just wish he'd find someone else to blame for all his problems,\" She said walking to where Wade was. I really wished I would have stayed home. OOOOOOOO I don't remembered exactly what time we all fell to sleep, or I was trying to at least but found it difficult with the hard ground beneath my back as I lay next to Wade on his right side as Carly slept on his left. Apparently she couldn't sleep either because I felt her shake Wade awake. \"Wade,\" She whispered. \"I heard something!\" I heard Wade groan and when he put his arms above his head his right elbow hit my shoulder. \"Son of a-\" I started but didn't finish as I held my elbow in pain. \"Sorry,\" Carly said apologetic. \"It's okay,\" I groaned. \"Wade, was always a hard sleeper. Isn't this weird I'm sharing a tent with you two?\" Carly sighed. \"Nick was being an ass as usual. You didn't have a choice. Though I am surprised that you two are together,\" She commented. \"I don't think we are anymore,\" I said softly. \"I kind of figured after that yelling match,\" She said smiling. I groaned. \"Great.\" \"Your better off without Nick. Trust me. All he does is bring misery everywhere he goes.\" \"You don't have to tell me twice,\" I said. We heard a twig snapping. Carly and I sat up. \"I told you I heard something,\" She whispered. \"It's probably Dalton filming us,\" I said. \"If it makes you fell any better I'll go out and see,\" I said unzipping the tent. \"I'm going with you since Wade won't help,\" She said following me. Outside the tent I stood up with Carly beside me. We walked towards where the cars were looking around. \"Now I wish it was Dalton filming us,\" She said making cover my mouth from laughing. \"It's probably an animal,\" I suggested. We turned to go back to the tent and nearly screamed as we faced Wade. \"What are you doing,\" He asked us. \"Now the hero comes,\" I said sarcastically. \"We heard something,\" Carly said. \"There's no one here. Let's get back to bed,\" He said. For some reason I felt like someone was watching us as we went back to the tent. OOOOOOOOOO \"Nick!\" I heard Blake yell waking me up. \"GET UP!\" \"OKAY!\" I yelled back cranky from the lack of sleep. Carly and Wade got out of the tent first and I followed looking at my watch. There was no way we were going to make the game. \"Blake,\" I yelled. \"We're not going to make it.\" \"We're making it,\" He yelled back already throwing stuff into the back of his truck. \"Let's go change,\" Carly said grabbing my arm. I smirked as Paige followed us. \"I bet Dalton wished he was filming us now.\" We stopped when we reached the woods. I changed into a pair of black shorts and a light blue tank top, as Carly changed into regular jeans and a yellow sleeve shirt when an awful smell from last night blew by from the breeze. \"Yuck,\" I said putting a hand to my nose as did Paige. \"It's coming from there,\" Carly said pointing and following it. \"Let's follow the smell,\" Paige said sarcastically making me and Carly laugh. \"Carly does Wade know this side of you,\" I asked when I did Carly slid down a slope falling. \"CARLY!\" we yelled. \"I'M STUCK! She yelled trying not to cry. \"WADE!\" All of a sudden the guys were running down to her. Paige and I followed carefully so we wouldn't slip and stopped when we saw Wade picking Carly up out of dead carcass. \"That smells about right,\" Nick said gagging. Bile rose in my mouth. \"You okay,\" Wade asked her. \"Yeah,\" Carly said panting. \"Have you guys seen my camera,\" Dalton asked us. \"Seriously,\" Paige said disgusted. \"Man,\" Dalton moaned. Nick came up beside me. \"You okay?\" \"I'm not the one that fell,\" I said bitter. He sighed. \"How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?\" \"Not here Nick,\" I whispered. \"Then when?\" I didn't answer as a truck pulled up. \"Is that the truck from last night,\" Carly asked. \"Not unless it fixed its headlight,\" Wade answered. We all watched as a homely looking guy got out of the truck and unloaded a dead deer in the bile. \"Don't you see that,\" Carly asked him. The guy looked at her then at where she was pointing. Please don't tell me that's a dead hand. \"What are you doing,\" Nick asked freaked. The guy yanked on the hand and it came off. It was a fake! \"I'm just messing with you,\" The guy said smiling. \"Perfect,\" Paige said annoyed. \"Do you know where the nearest town is,\" Wade asked him. \"Why,\" Carly asked. \"The fan belt broke,\" Wade muttered. \"Of course it did,\" She said. \"I can give you a ride to town. Bo owns the local garage,\" The man said. \"I'm not going,\" Wade said. \"What if someone strips my car?\" \"You have to get the fan belt,\" I said. \"I'll stay with the car.\" \"No,\" Nick said. \"Your not staying with his car by yourself.\" \"He's right,\" Wade said. \"What choice to you have,\" Carly said. \"I'll go with you to town to get it.\" \"Carly no,\" Paige said worried. \"I'll be fine,\" She promised. \"Emma your coming with us. I promised mom and dad I'd look out after you,\" Wade said. I smiled. \"No offense, Wade but this would be the time to spend with Carly by your self.\" \"Your not staying by yourself,\" Wade argued. \"Wade, I'm 18. I can take care of myself,\" I argued. \"I'll stay with you,\" Nick said which caused everyone to look at him. \"I know I've been an ass on this trip but Wade needs to get his car fixed. I'll stay.\" \"Don't burn my car down when I'm gone,\" Wade told him tossing Emma the keys. \"Alright it's settled. Let's go\" Carly pleaded. Carly and Wade went to the guys truck while everyone else walked back to the site. \"You didn't have to do that,\" I told Nick who was walking next to me. \"I meant what I said. I'm not going to lose you.\" \"I can't believe my camera's gone,\" Dalton said upset as we made it back to Blake's truck. Blake opened the ice chess and pulled got out some water bottles for us. \"Do you want me to leave it here,\" He asked. \"It's fine. Go try to make the game,\" I said. \"Be careful,\" Paige said getting in the truck followed by Blake and Dalton. We watched them drive off. \"At least we finally get to be by ourselves,\" Nick grinned. I rolled my eyes at him. \"I'm still pissed at you.\" \"I know,\" He said wrapping his arm around me and pulled me close. \"That's what makes making up fun.\" I smiled. \"That line isn't going to work with me.\" \"I think it is,\" He said kissing me. \"Maybe a little,\" I said kissing him back. A/N: Not much this chapter I know. Next chapter the horror will begin. Thanks to all the reviews![Chapter 3] Thanks for the reviews! I sat against Wade's car waiting for this dreadful trip to be over. Luckily I had my ipod so I had music playing. \"Do you think someone's screwing with us,\" I asked him. \"Why would you say that,\" He said looking at me like I was nuts. \"Well there's the fact that you broke that trucks headlight last night and then there was the fan belt that looked like it was cut in half from Wade's car and now Dalton's camera is missing,\" I said in a rush. \"What you think it's the guy from last night's truck doing this? Come on! Nothing's happened to Blake or the rest of us.\" I sighed. \"I forgot. You never take things seriously.\" \"I take us seriously\" He said pulling me up on my feet to face him. \"Could have fooled me,\" I drawled. \"I know I'm an ass okay? That's just the way it's meant to be. Carly's the good twin and I'm the evil one,\" He said taking a drink of his beer. \"You expect me to by that crap? No one forced you to do that stuff!\" \"Because I'm the evil twin,\" He repeated. \"I didn't come on this trip to fight!\" \"You think I did?\" \"So let's stop fighting then for two seconds!\" He yelled kissing me. The kiss lasted for a good three minutes before my cell phone rang. \"Don't answer it.\" \"It could be Wade or Carly,\" I said looking at the phone. \"Carly,\" I said. \"You want to talk to her?\" Nick glared at me. I smiled and answered. \"Hey, Carly,\" I said. \"Did you guys make it to that town?\" \" Yeah but the owner of the gas station is in a funeral at the moment,\" She said on the phone. \"Can't you just leave money for it and leave? It's almost going to be dark.\" \" We're waiting ten more minutes. If not then we're going to leave.' \"Be careful,\" I said having a bad feeling all of a sudden. I felt like someone was watching me other than Nick. \" We will,\" Carly said hanging up. \"Well,\" Nick said waiting for me to answer. \"They made it to the town,\" I said and lowered my voice. \"I think someone's watching us.\" Nick looked at me in surprise. \"Why would you think that?' \"I'm not thinking. I just know.\" All of a sudden we saw Blake's truck pulling in next to us. \"That's who it was,\" Nick said laughing. I rolled my eyes. Something doesn't feel right. \"What happened to the game,\" Nick asked Blake. \"Traffic,\" Blake said angry. \"Made us miss the game.\" \"Have you heard from Carly,\" Paige asked me. \"Their fine,\" I said. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah,\" I said lying then suddenly felt my bladder full. \"I'll be back.\" \"Where are you going,\" Nick asked me. \"Nature calls,\" I said walking to where the trees were. I made sure the group couldn't see me as I went but I was still able to see them. I sighed in relief as the pressure from my bladder released. Is that something a guy would do? I asked myself horrified at the thought. Great, now I'm talking to myself in my head. I was so wrapped up in my own thoughts I didn't even see someone come up behind me and knock me out. OOOOOOOO \"What the hell is taking her so long,\" Nick said looking out to where Emma went. \"Maybe she needed a breather,\" Paige said with a smirk. Nick gave her a irritated look. \"She was upset before.\" \"Probably because you caused it,\" Blake said laughing. \"Come on. She probably just needed some time to herself. You know how chicks can be.' \"Chicks,\" Paige said looking at him. \"Girls,\" Blake corrected himself. \"I don't like this,\" Nick said. \"EMMA!\" He yelled worried. Paige looked at him. \"Somethings not right. She would have answered.\" \"I'm going to look for her,\" Nick said walking towards the area. \"I'll go with you,\" Blake said. \"Babe, no,\" Paige said scared. \"Nothing's going to happen to me,\" Blake said kissing her. \"We'll be back.\" \"So now I'm going to be stuck with Dalton. That's just great,\" She fumed. \"At least he can't film you,\" Blake laughed running to catch up with Nick. OOOOOOOOOO I woke up and felt a hand touching my cheek. \"Nick,\" I said groggy opening my eyes all the way. I gasped in shock and fear. I was strapped down to a table. \"Your boyfriend can't help you,\" A man's voice said to my right. I managed to turn my head and saw a man in his 30's or early 40's with dark hair. I swallowed hard. \"You were the one watching us.\" He patted my cheek and I cringed. \"You should have trusted your gut,\" He said laughing. \"Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you. I think I want you to be my wife.\" Oh God. Where was Nick? Is he okay? A tear slid down my cheek. I knew I should have stayed home. \"Why are you doing this,\" I asked completely scared. It felt like I was having a panic attack. \"Because I can,\" He said with a shrug holding a needle. God. Tell me he's not going to stick that in me? I started to have trouble breathing. It felt like my lungs were being squeezed crushing the air out. The guy must have heard me gasping for air because he turned around fast. \"Your not dying on me,\" He said looking angry. I couldn't speak now. I felt something sting my arm and I passed out. OOOOOOOOOOO Nick was going out of his mind. He couldn't find Emma anywhere. It wasn't like her to just take off and not say anything. \"We should call the cops,\" Nick said as they walked back to the camp site. \"Did you find her,\" Paige asked worried. \"No,\" He said angry. \"It's like she vanished.\" \"Maybe she needed time to herself after all the fighting,\" Dalton suggested. Nick glared at him. \"She would have at least said where she was going. I'm calling the cops.\" Just as he was about to dial his phone rang. \" Nick,\" Carly said on the phone. \"I need help. They have Wade,\" She said crying. \"What are you talking about? Who has Wade?\" \" The owner of the gas station,\" She said. \"This place is a freak show. I saw the owner carry Emma inside where Wade is.\" \"Carly, where are you?\" \" I'm hiding behind a fence.\" \"Stay calm. I'm on my way,\" Nick said hanging up. \"We're going to that town. Carly said the owner of the local gas station has Wade and Emma.\" \"I'm going with you,\" Blake said angry. \"Babe, no,\" Paige protested. \"You two call the cops. Dalton and I are going,\" Nick told him. Blake tossed Dalton the keys to the truck. \"Be careful.\" Nick and Dalton walked over to Blake's truck. \"Give me the keys,\" Nick said holding out his hand. \"Blake said I could drive,\" Dalton said not giving the keys up. Nick grabbed his hand with the keys. \"That's because he doesn't know that it was you that wrecked that car,\" He said in a low voice. \"Alright,\" Dalton said giving up the keys and getting in the truck. \"Do you really think something happened to Emma and Wade,\" He asked as Nick started driving. Nick kept his eyes on the road. \"I hope not. I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.\" \"What about, Wade?\" \"Wade's not so bad,\" Nick admitted. \"Are you saying that because he's Emma's brother?\" Nick looked at him real quick. \"No. I can't complain. He treats my sister good, way better than I treat his.\" Dalton stared at him in shock. \"I've never seen this side of you before, Nick.\" Nick groaned. \"Shut up.\" OOOOOOOOOO Wade struggled against the ropes. He should have listened to Carly and knew not to go in the House of Wax. Now because of his stupid decision Carly might be dead. \"You might as well stop struggling because your not getting out of here alive,\" Bo said with a grin watching him from the doorway. \"Where's Carly?\" Bo made a face. \"Bitch got away. Don't worry. I'll find her. Just like I found your pretty sister,\" Bo said with a smirk holding a photo of Emma who was strapped down on a table obviously unconscious. Wade glared at Bo. \"You hurt my sister I swear to God I'll kill you!\" Bo mocked him. \"I don't know how you can since your tied up. I'm not going to kill your sister. I plan on keeping her alive as my wife.\" Wade scoffed. \"You've got to be kidding me.\" Bo punched him across the face. \"Why would I joke about that? You should thank your lucky stars that your still alive at the moment. Just wait until Vincent comes down. When he does, you'll wish I killed you,\" Bo sneered walking out the room angry and slamming the door behind him. \"Damn it,\" Wade said to himself. \"How am I going to get out of this one?\" OOOOOOOO A/N: So am I doing okay so far? Is it a little different from the movie? Reviews please![Chapter 4] I woke up and felt someone on me, touching me where I didn't want to be touched. I never even let Nick touch me like that. I cried out in pain. \"GET OFF ME!\" I yelled earning a hard slap to my face causing me to cry harder. \"I didn't want to hurt you but your not behaving yourself,\" The familiar voice said angry. I finally forced myself to look at man on me and saw that it was the one that kidnapped me. He stroked the side of my face his breath hot on mine. \"You are one pretty little thing.\" I tried to turn my head so I couldn't see his face but he forced me to look at him. \"Please don't do this,\" I begged. How low can I get to be begging? \"I love it when they beg,\" I felt more tears fall. How many innocent girls did he take? \"I especially love it when their virgins.\" I screamed. OOOOOOOOOO Wade struggled harder as he heard his little sister's cries. \"Come on!\" He grunted his face turning red. Finally the ropes broke. OOOOOOOOOO Nick parked Blake's truck and got out. \"This is it,\" Dalton asked looking at the stream. \"Rest is on foot,\" Nick said setting the truck alarm and walked towards the town. OOOOOOOOOOO I struggle against the man on top of me even though I knew it wouldn't help. Men were stronger. They were always stronger. I was pathetic. I didn't even know the name of the man rapping me. I started to prepare myself for the worse when I felt the man thrown off of me. \"Emma,\" I heard Wade's voice and felt the straps off of her. I threw my arms around him and cried. \"I thought I was never going to see you again.\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" Wade said pulling me close to him. \"Did you kill him,\" I asked looking at the man's form on the ground. \"I only knocked Bo out,\" He said dragging me through some place that I wasn't familiar with. Bo. That was his name. \"Where's Carly,\" I asked once we were outside. I noticed it was dark out.. \"I don't know,\" He said panting from running. I looked up and the place read House of Wax. All of a sudden I started shaking badly and I knew I was having a breakdown. I fell to my knees and felt Wade hugged me. \"Hey. It's okay,\" He said trying to comfort me but we both knew it wasn't working. I looked up at him and screamed when I saw Bo behind him and hit him. Wade fell down with a grunt. \"Where do you think your going,\" Bo asked angry advancing on me. \"Hey!\" Bo turned around getting punched in the face by Wade. I saw Bo's shotgun on the ground and ran to it. I picked it up and pointed it at him. \"Stop!\" I yelled. Bo stopped and smiled at her. \"You ain't going to shoot me.\" \"Try me,\" I threatened. Wade walked over to me. \"Put the shotgun down.\" I shook my head. \"He's going to keep coming after us! Don't you get that?\" \"Don't let him make you a murderer,\" Wade pleaded. Bo was smirking at me now. I felt my finger pull the trigger but nothing happened. \"What-\" I said confused still pulling the trigger. \"Do you think I'm stupid enough to have a loaded gun just lying around,\" Bo said laughing. He charged at me and I swung the shotgun against his stomach making him grunt in pain. I tried to hit him again but he caught the gun. I struggled trying to keep hold of my only weapon against him. He yanked the shotgun away from me with such force I fell flat on my butt. Wade punched him which only distracted him long enough for me to get back on my feet. I tried to look around for another weapon to use but there was nothing. Bo knocked Wade on his back and Wade fell with a grunt. I bent down to help him but froze when I saw the shot gun pointed close to Wade's face. \"Once I pull this trigger, you'll be dead,\" Bo snarled. OOOOOOOOOO Nick and Dalton walked in the town called Ambrose in search of their friends. \"Is it me or does this town look empty,\" Dalton said looking around. \"There's got to be someone in this town,\" Nick said walking towards the gas station. \"It's creepy,\" Dalton said. \"Too quiet for you,\" Nick said with a smirk. \"When a killer might have our friends, yes.\" They both turned around when they heard running footsteps. \"Carly,\" Nick said never thought he'd be happy to see his sister. \"Nick, we have to get out of here! This place is a freak show!\" She said scared. \"Where's Emma and Wade?\" \"I don't know! Probably up at the house. This whole town is rigged!\" \"What do you mean rigged,\" Dalton asked worried. \"Everyone here is made of wax!\" Nick frowned. \"How can that even be possible?\" \"I don't know but it is,\" She said wincing as she hit her finger. Nick noticed it was bloody. \"Did he do that to you,\" He said angry. All three jumped in shock as they heard Emma scream.[Chapter 5] I screamed and threw myself over Wade when I heard a gunshot. I felt something go through me and felt unbearable pain. I lost my balance and fell on top of Wade. I heard Wade yell in agony. OOOOOOOO \"Emma!\" Nick yelled. Carly put a hand over his mouth. \"What are you doing,\" She whispered. \"He's going to find us.\" Nick removed her hand and looked down at her. \"He's already got, Emma. I can't lose her Carly.\" Nick turned to Dalton and tossed him the keys. \"Get Carly out of here.' \"Nick, I'm not leaving you,\" Carly protested. \"I'm sorry, Nick but chances are Emma is already dead along with Wade,\" She said her voice breaking. Then they heard Wade yell in agony. \"YOU BASTARD!\" \"I'm going Carly,\" Nick said. \"They wouldn't give up on us. We're not giving up on them.\" He took off running to where Wade was yelling. OOOOOOOOOOO Wade tried to hold Emma but Bo forced her off of him. She looked pale from blood loss. \"I'm going to kill you,\" Wade said with venom. Bo casually checked for a pulse on Emma and smirked when he found on. \"Relax. She's alive,\" He said like nothing. \"I wouldn't do anything to harm my future wife.\" \"Wade,\" Nick yelled running at them. Wade looked surprised to see Nick who started attacking Bo causing him to drop Emma on the ground. She landed with a thud and groaned. \"Emma,\" Wade said crawling to his sister. He brushed hair out of her face as she tried to open her eyes. \"Wade, it hurts,\" She cried. \"I know,\" He said his face in pain for his sister. \"I promise your going to be fine.\" She lowered her eyes. \"Don't make promises you can't keep.\" \"I'm keeping this promise.\" They heard another gun shot. Wade looked and saw Bo dead on the ground. \"He's dead, Emma. He can't hurt you again,\" Wade said trying to keep his voice calm. Nick bent down and picked her up in his arms. He saw the gunshot wound on her shoulder. \"You got to hang on, Emma,\" Nick pleaded and looked at Wade. \"I need something to stop the bleeding.\" Wade ripped off his jacket and tore it into strips. \"This might hurt,\" Nick told her as he took the strips and wrapped it around her still holding her. \"Let's get her to a hospital.\" A/N: Short chapter I know. Next one will be longer.[Chapter 6] I woke up groggy in a hospital bed. I could tell by the itchy thin blanket and how cold it was. I didn't even want to think about the smell. \"Your awake,\" Wade said in a chair next to my bed. I turned and saw how beat up and worried he looked. His hair was greasy as if he hadn't taken a shower in days. Well technically he hasn't. \"What happened,\" I asked my throat scratchy. Wade must of noticed because he poured some water into a plastic cup and handed it to me which I took greedily. \"You don't remember,\" He asked with a frown. I narrowed my eyes. \"I remember. What happened to Bo?\" Wade looked angry. \"We thought he was dead but by the time cops showed up his body was gone.\" My eyes went wide in fear. \"He can still come after us then!\" \"Emma, you've got to calm down. I got a guard at your door. I called mom and dad and they're on a flight here.\" I groaned. \"Was dad mad?\" \"When isn't he mad?\" Wade joked. I heard foot steps in the room. Thinking it was Nick I turned to see who it was but it was Bo! \"Wade!\" I screamed but it was too late. Bo had already killed him. \"Now where were we,\" Bo said with a evil grin advancing on me. I screamed again and again. OOOOOOOOOOOO Emma was thrashing so hard and screaming, that Nick lost his balance and dropped her on the ground close to the camp site. \"Shit,\" He said worried. \"What's wrong with her?\" \"Nightmare probably,\" Wade said bending down. \"Post traumatic stress,\" He said guessing. He grabbed her shoulders. \"Emma you got to wake up!\" He yelled shaking her. OOOOOOOOO I kept screaming. Right when Bo grabbed me I heard Wade's voice begging me to wake up. \"I'll find you either way,\" Bo snarled. Before knew it my eyes popped open and I found myself staring at Wade who was alive. \"That must have been some nightmare,\" Nick joked trying to lighten the mood. \"I saw him kill you,\" I said looking at Wade. \"Are you sure he's dead?\" Wade and Nick looked at each other wondering how I knew that. \"I shot him three times,\" Nick said. \"How do you know about?\" I tried standing up but I couldn't push myself up because of my shoulder so Nick helped me up. \"It was like I was there but I wasn't,\" I said. \"He's gotten inside you,\" Carly spoke softly. I looked at her. She had been so quiet I forgot she was with us. \"We got to keep moving,\" Wade said. \"We're almost at the campsite.\" We all started walking. \"How can you even walk,\" Nick asked me. \"Your face is white as a ghost.\" \"I guess it's the fear making me move.\" A few minutes later we made it to the campsite. \"Paige!\" Carly yelled running to the tents. \"Why aren't they answering,\" I asked Nick scared. Carly opened a tent and screamed in horror. Wade ran to her. \"Oh, god.\" Wade gagged turning away. I started to panic. \"He's here.\" \"How can that be? I killed him,\" Nick practically yelled. \"Vincent,\" Carly said wiping tears from her eyes. \"Who's Vincent,\" Nick asked confused. \"Bo's brother,\" Wade said. \"Bo was going to have Vincent kill me before I got away.\" \"What if he helped, Bo,\" I asked scarred because I had watched a lot of horror movies to know that the killer never died or at least not right away. Carly swallowed. \"They're coming for us. They won't stop until we're all dead.\" I looked around and frowned. \"Where did Dalton go?\"[Chapter 7] \"Dalton!\" Nick yelled. \"Vincent must have gotten him when we weren't looking,\" Carly said scared for Dalton. I looked at Nick and I knew what he was thinking. \"No,\" I said. \"Dalton's probably dead. If we go back we're asking to die.\" \"Well, I'm not leaving you girls by yourself. Dalton has the keys to the truck to get out.\" I looked at Carly who looked the same way as I did and nodded. \"We're going together then,\" I said. \"Your not going,\" Wade practically yelled. \"Bo almost killed you!\" \"He almost killed me because I got in the way of him killing you. You heard Bo. He wants to make me his wife. If I can get close to him maybe I can distract him long enough for you guys to look for Dalton.\" \"It's a stupid plan,\" Wade argued. \"We don't even have weapons. Any sane person would run away.\" \"I can get a weapon once inside the house,\" I said. \"I'm not going to let Bo stay inside my head. I want him out.\" \"Aren't you scared,\" Carly asked. I scoffed. \"Dalton's our friend.\" Nick grabbed my hand in his and kissed it. He looked at Wade. \"It's four against two. We have a better shot.\" \"This is different. The whole damn town is made of wax!\" Wade yelled. Carly walked closer to Wade. \"We've got to stick together.\" Wade sighed. \"I'm so going to regret this.\" I smirked. \"I regretted coming from the beginning.\" OOOOOOOOO We walked back to Ambrose. Once we walked in town we all separated. Wade,Carly and Nick were looking for Dalton while I made my way up to the house. I was so scared as I walked up the steps. I had a piece of shard glass in my pants pocket. My only weapon until I got inside. As I reached the steps I started to slow my pace realizing just how bad this plan was. I couldn't mess it up. Especially when we didn't know what happened to Dalton. I opened the door to the house and slowly walked in closing the door quietly as I could. I heard Bo talking angry from the kitchen and obviously in pain. Good. He deserves it. I glanced to the side stifled a gasp when I saw Dalton's camera sitting on a pool table. I squeezed my eyes shut to keep from crying. Wade was right. Dalton's dead if they have his camera. \"Like what you see,\" Bo said in an angry voice making me jump in surprise. I turned and faced him. \"Where's Dalton,\" I asked. Bo walked closer to me. \"Right now he's my brother's art project.\" I cringed silently praying for Dalton for what he might be going through. \"I knew I liked you for a reason,\" He said advancing on me. \"Any other sane girl would have run for the hills but not you.\" I spat in his face and he slapped me hard causing me to cry out in pain from the sudden movement of my injured shoulder. He roughly grabbed my face forcing me to look at him. \"I knew using that idiot as bait would bring you back.\" All of a sudden he forced his lips on mine and I tried to pull away but he held me close. \"Ooh, I love it when your scared,\" He said his hot breath close to my face. I smirked up at him. \"I love it when you get your ass kicked.\" With that I kicked him hard between his legs causing him to double over in pain. I ran fast into the kitchen and grabbed a sharp knife. I ran down to the basement already out of breath. I thought I heard Nick's voice and followed where it went. I stopped when I saw Nick, Carly and Wade standing next to what used to be Dalton. \"Nick,\" I said in a strained voice. He turned and looked at me. The look on his face broke my heart. \"We've got to get out of here,\" Wade said. Carly looked at me. \"Did you take care of Bo?\" I shook my head. \"I barely had enough time to distract him for the knife,\" I said holding it up. \"Let's torch this place,\" Nick said angry. \"What about the innocent people trapped inside of wax,\" I asked. \"Then we'll put them out of their misery,\" Wade said. Nick looked surprised at Wade. \"EMMA!\" Bo yelled down the hall. \"WHEN I FIND YOU, YOUR GOING TO WISH I KILLED YOU!\" I didn't see what Nick turned over but the floor caught on fire. Carly snatched up a scalpel and held it tight in her hand. This was it.[Chapter 8] Sadly this is the last chapter. Thanks to everyone that reviewed and supported the story. I stood next to Nick as Carly stood next to Wade with a scalpel in her hand. Nick had managed to dump the wax which started a fire creating a barrier between us and Bo. \"No one has ever left this town alive,\" Bo said evilly. The fire made his face look more evil than it was. I looked him in the face. \"There's a first time for everything.\" With that I threw the knife at him and landed in his chest. He screamed in rage as we all ran out of the building. It didn't take long before the whole building was up in flames courteous of it being made out of wax. \"It's finally over,\" Carly said leaning against Wade who had his arm wrapped around her. \"No more innocent people have to suffer,\" Wade said. I just continued to stare at the burning building as sirens sounded off in the distance. Nick nudged me in my good shoulder. \"You okay?\" I smiled at him. \"No more road trips.\" He pulled me into a hug. \"Deal.\" After we had talked to the authorities we made our way back to the camp site. We had packed our belongings except for a couple of sleeping bags and had fallen asleep quickly. I didn't know how long it had been when we had fallen asleep but a sound woke me. Before I could sit up a bloody dirty hand covered my mouth so I couldn't scream. \"Told you no one made it out of Ambrose alive,\" Bo snarled.

Dodger: That about does it, thank you for listening and good night! The audiences said nothing, most of them were very bored, one cough and the other booed at them. Tramp: Well that could have gone better. Dodger: Oh no, they \"loved\" our gig. Thomas: What makes you say that? Dodger: They gave us a fruit. He hold up an apple, which looked a little bruised. Tramp: Better the wall than our face, I guess. Thomas: What happen? We used to have so much fun and we at least had some fans. Dodger: Beats me. I mean I can handle a disappointing crowd, but it seems like no one wants to deal with us anymore. Everytime I get a phone call it's always a call for an end of a deal. They all sighed. Dodger: Man this sucks! I feel like I'm letting you and my family down! When we first started this, we were at least having fun and staying alive, now it's just like nobody cares anymore. I almost can't provide for my wife and child. Tramp: What about that other job you having right now selling records and tapes? Dodger: It's alright, but it's just as bad as our gig. The only decent amount money I got was selling that turnstyle and record to Tito. Thomas: How much? Dodger: About $1,500. At least he attract a good amount of crowd. Here. Dodger had some of the money that Tito gave him. Tramp: Nah, man. You keep it, it's your money. Dodger: But you guys deserve some, too. It's not right that I get have some and leave you with nothing. Thomas: It's alright Dodger. We're not homeless, we got our families helping us out too. Beside you need it more than us, so keep it. Dodger: It still doesn't feel right. I mean you guys are like my second family and I can't even pay you as much anymore. Tramp: We'll be fine, having you is enough payment for us. Dodger: Thanks. You're the best. Thomas: Well, I think it's time we head home. Our wives and kids will probably want to hear about our day. See ya. Dodger: Take care. Tramp: Oh and Dodger. Don't ever lose hope. You never know, we get lucky and have another hit someday, and if not, at least we still have each other. As Dodger was making his way to his apartment, he saw a light brown Chihuahua with red hair. ?: Hey, Dodger my man! Thank you so much for selling me that DJ set and those records, they really helped me out big time! Dodger: Thanks, Tito. At least I have one satisfying person for the night. Tito: Hey you got any other records you not using much? Dodger: I'm not sure. I'll get back to you on that. See ya. ?: Dad! A little orange kitten with red and blue shirt came running into his dad's arms. Dodger: Hey kid! How's my favorite son? Oliver: I'm great. Look I made this for you in art class. It was picture of Oliver and his dad with the band, with Oliver as the singer. Dodger: Wow, that's actually nice. Like what you did to my face. Did Mom help you with it? ?: Nope, he did it by himself. A brown slender Saluki was standing by the hall with some papers in her hand. Dodger laid a kiss on her hand. ?: Just the hand? He chuckled and give her another one on the lips. Dodger: What am I going to do you with you, Rita? Rita: Oliver wanted to make you smiled and he thought about your band, and made it for you. Dodger: Thanks, kid. You really did a good job. Oliver and Dodger went in for a hug. Dodger: I'm just sorry I can't provide much for you or Rita. Oliver: It's okay, dad. I'm just happy to have you. Hey, tomorrow's Saturday, can we go to the park, tomorrow? Dodger: With your favorite bike? They hugged again. Dodger: Well anything you like for supper tonight? Oliver: Hmm… Surprise me. Dodger: Alright, is it alright if I talk to your mother real quick? Oliver: Sure. Oliver went to his room, while Dodger just look at the picture and smiled. Rita: Another rough night? Dodger: Ding, ding, ding, you're right! And here you win a bruised apple from me! Rita: Well, I guess I put on my desk Monday. Dodger just chuckled, and sighed. Dodger: You know everyday when I have a terrible day, I always look forward on coming home to you and the kid. I swear if you or the kid were never born I probably would have end up looking worse than before. Rita just planned a kiss on Dodger's cheek. Rita: Don't worry, dear. I'm sure you'll get your big chance someday. Dodger: I know, but it just sucks. I mean I've got you and the kid and with the way things are going I can't help out that much in terms of money. I can't buy you nice flowers as much or take you out to a fancy dinner! You deserve something for helping me out so much! Rita: Honey, you know I don't need anything fancy to prove you love me. You working hard enough to help me and Oliver out is all I need to prove you love us. I still have my ring that you've work so hard to get for our wedding and remember the necklace I wanted that you gave for me for my birthday. Dodger: Yeah, 24-hours of playing and working so hard at a music store, it was tiring, but that was a promise I made to myself, because I love you and it was worth it, I still remember all the tight squeeze you gave me and the squeal when I gave it to you. Rita (Blushing): Well, it was just so surprising. I didn't actually think you get for me. But while I love the necklace, I still love you more than any necklace, and every time I wear it, I'm thinking about you. Dodger: That's how I feel about this microphone. You also had to work hard at a fast food place non-stop to get this for me. Rita: Eh, don't remind me. I had to keep telling myself I'm doing this for you to stay in that hell. But it was worth to see you smiling for so long. You hadn't smile like that until you surprised Oliver with a bike you gave him for Christmas. Dodger: 'We' gave him, because we both had to work hard to come up with the money, but you're right I was smiling non-stop, because he was happy, and I was so proud of myself, and you of course. *sigh* But now I feel like crap. Rita gently gave him a backrub. Rita: I know. But Dodge. Don't forget we're in this together. We'll get through, somehow. Dodger gave a small smile. Dodger: Thanks dear. You're always the best. They sheared another kiss. Dodger: You know, I still have the money Tito gave me for the DJ set and records. I know it's not your most favorite place, but would like to join Oliver and I for a family lunch at that Burger joint by the park, and catch up with our friend George? Rita: Hmm… sure. It would nice to spend time with each other. Uh… Dodger: Let me guess, Pizza for dinner, again? Rita: Yes. Pepporine! Dodger: I know you by now! Rita just chuckled and sighed. She also hoped things will be alright.[Chapter 2] *ding-dong* *ding-dong* Dodger: Alright, alright. Cool it down! Standing by the front was a poodle with baby blue hair and a bow, thin type. While Dodger was not good friends with her he admits he sometimes has a soft side for her. Dodger: Well, this is a surprise, I guess you finally learn that you want to be the \"losers\" too. Georgette: Har, har. Listen, as much as it pains me to ask. I need help. May I come in? Dodger: Wow, even more surprises. Must be my birthday. Georgette: Whatever, I'm just wasting your time it seems. Dodger: Now wait minute, I didn't say you can go. You're still technically a friend of ours, even if you don't agree. Come on in, and I'll see what I can do for you. Georgette let herself in. Georgette: Just make it quick. I don't want too many people knowing that I came in here. Dodger: Still self centered as always. Georgette: And you're still a smart-ass, so what's your point? Dodger: Touche. So what I can help you with? Georgette: I'll cut right to the chase, next week it's the wedding anniversary between me and Tito, and Tito explained to me that he's going to try to find a place to reserved just for us and a few of our friends. I want to find a song to sing to him to explain how much he means to me. I thought you might have the kind of song he might like. Dodger: Well, what type are you looking for? Georgette: Well, I know he usually like the upbeat type of music. I usually like it for parties, but I like more of a romantic smooth type of music, especially for this occasion. Dodger: Then I know a good band that has both. He went out to the back for about 3 minutes and came back with two records. Dodger: I have two records of a popular band the Beatles. They have great melodies and lyrics. They do both upbeat and smooth music. Perfect for anyone that you love. Georgette: I remember the Beatles, they were one of first bands I've listened too as a kid. My father would sing to me one of their songs to cheer me up. Dodger: Yeah, they were also an inspiration for me. Georgette notice Dodger getting a little misty eye after talking about the Beatles. Georgette: So, how's the band doing? Dodger: Not so hot. Still gets a bad rep around here and everywhere else. At least you still have a job with the talent show. When's the next one, anyway? Georgette: Actually, there's not going to be one this year. After a big commission last year they've decided that they're going hang low for now. So now I'm out of a job. Dodger: So, you looking for another job or something? Georgette: I'm trying. Believe or not, before I went as a contestant on a talent show, I was also thinking about being a news reporter. Feeling that the world needed to see a beautiful poodle. Dodger was trying his best not to snicker. Georgette: I've multiple networking station, but no one wants anything to with me, thinking I had something to do with the commission of the talent show. Dodger: That's stupid! Georgette: Hmmph. Would you have said the same thing if you never met me? Dodger: … Georgette: No worries. I guess I'll just have to hang low myself and find some odd jobs. How much are these by the way? Dodger: Well if you buy both it's $60, if you buy one of the two it'll be $30, but I'll make a deal with you, I'll let you buy both for $30 and try them out, if you don't like them then I'll give you your money back, if you like them then you can pay me the other 30 after the party. Georgette made the purchase and handed Dodger three $10 bills. Dodger: Oh, and Georgette! She stopped and turned her head. Dodger: Don't tell anyone this, but I hope you make it into the news world. It's not fair that you're considered part of the blame. Georgette: Well… Don't tell anyone this, but I hope you and your band makes it to the top, because between you and me, you're the only decent band that's out there right now. Later Dodger took Oliver to the park on his bike as promise, Rita follow them as well. It wasn't much, but neither of them complained, as long as they have each other. They took a walk from the park and later went to Big Edda's Burger Joint for some lunch. Dodger: Hey Bob! A white human with a worker uniform turned around and smiled. Bob: Hey, Dodger. How's our regular customer doing? Dodger: Eh, hanging in there to say the least. Um… Dodger pointed Bob to a person staring at the grill. Bob: Ugh, not again. Hey George. George? GEORGE! George: AH! Bob: Were you daydreaming again? George: Uh no, I was just admiring how shining and clean this grill is. Bob: Come on George, were a little busy here. Why don't take our friends order, while I prepare the food. George turned and notice Dodger, Rita, and Oliver. George: Hey, Dodger! How's life going? Oliver: Crappy. Rita: Oliver! Dodger: Were you letting your imagination run with you again? George: No. Dodger: … George: Yes. Dodger: I remember you were so bad with that in high school, that it still amazes me that you were able to graduate. George: I know, I just can't help it! You know, whenever I see something, I immediately get an idea running through to me. You must feel that way too when it comes to your music. Dodger: Can't argue there. Rita: But your imagination is costing you and Bob job after job after job. Bob: Thank you! Rita: You need to find some type of job that'll let you use as much of your imagination as you can. George: That's what Teri says too. But don't you worry, one day they'll be sorry. One morning someone will wake up and realized that they've made a mistake of firing me, because I got that imagination. So what can I get for you guys? Dodger: Just some decaf coffee will be fine. Rita: Uh… I'll take a burger, with some onions and lettuce, and a medium Pepsi. Oliver: I'll take a plain cheese burger, with some fries, and a medium Root Beer. George: Alright. All of that will cost you, $19.50. Dodger pulled out a $20, and got $.50 of change. Unfortunately, George left the fries too long in the frier which resulted in him and Bob getting fired, again. Luckily Dodger, Oliver, and Rita still got their food. Later when the family returned home, they found Tramp, with his wife, Lady, a brown cocker spaniel; and Thomas with his wife, Duchess, a white grown cat. Dodger: What are you guys doing here? Tramp: Well it's been awhile since we've hanged out, and we were a little worried about you. Thomas: We thought to come over and just talk and have some fun, and our wives wanted to see you, too. You're not busy, are you? Dodger: Nah. Come on in. It would nice to just sit and hang out like old times. The gang was at the living room and Rita offered each of them some tea or coffee. Tramp: So how was your day? Dodger: Well I can't complain. I had a good time with the kid and my wife. Just some fresh air is all I needed. We saw George and he got fired, again. Thomas: Imagination? Dodger: Yep. Tramp: Hphm. He really needs to find a job where his imagination would help instead of hurting him. Rita: Thank you! Dodger: What about you Duchess, still working on the dresses for your customers? Duchess: Oh, yes. I have our little artist Toulouse and Berlioz helping us with the design, you should see them, they're really good. Thomas: We even have a few her friends helping her sewing the dresses and she wants to make a costume for us at our next concert. Dodger: Well that's nice, but lets face it, I don't think there's going to be a next concert. Duchess: Oh, but I love your music. It was your band, that I met Thomas. Remember that song, you sang when I first entered the cafe? Thomas: How can I forget, \"Such a Groovy Guy.\" I even remember the kids laughing at the song after was done, and you just giggled, that caught my attention, but I didn't you go for a guy like me. Dodger: What about you Lady? How've you been holding up. Lady: Not so good. My boss just file bankruptcy again for his T.V. station and now all I can do is just wait and see what's going to happen, but it's probably going to be more bad news. Dodger: I'm sorry to hear that. Lady: It's alright. If something happens then I'll do what your wife is doing and just start teaching little kids. Rita: Think you can handle some screaming and crying from these students, it's not always so easy. Lady: I have four kids we have right now and one of them is a troublemaker. I think I could handle it. *Ding-Dong* Rita: I'll get it. She walked up to the front door to spot Georgette. Rita: Hey, Georgette. Georgette: Hello, Rita. Still looks like you could use a few make overs. Rita just rolled her eyes. Georgette: Oh well, everyone has their own way of dressing up I guess. Anyway, is your husband here? Rita: He's at the living room with his pals. Georgette: Oh. Well I don't stay too long, my husband his working at a party playing his music and I wanted to thank your husband by inviting you, him, and the kid to our wedding anniversary, it starts Friday at 7:00. Here you go. Rita: Oh, thanks. Are you sure you wouldn't want to come in for a little bit? We just go to my room and talk for bit. Georgette: You don't mind? Rita: Nah. It's been awhile since we've had a girl chat. Come on in. Oliver: Hi, Auntie Georgette. Georgette: Hello Oliver. Dodger: Hey Georgette. You remember the band, right? Georgette: Of course. Still looks like they could use some freshen up, but I've seen worst. Tramp: Everyone's a critic. Georgette: Oh, I love this women's fur and her ears. They match really well if your fur. Lady: Oh thank you. I'm Lady. I'm Tramp's wife. Georgette: Please to meet you. You must tell me who does your grooming. I like to get nice on myself someday. Lady: I actually do it myself. If you interested I can do it for you too whenever you're free. Georgette: Thank you, I would love that. OH la-la, I love this dress as well. It just screams beautiful. Duchess: You're too kind. My name's Duchess, I'm Thomas's wife. Georgette: Duchess. I've heard of you. You run that famous dressing store in New York, and I hear you have one in Paris, right? Duchess: It's true. Paris was my hometown, but my kids and I moved to New York to run the store and that's where I met my husband. Georgette: I've always wanted to try on one of your dresses, but I don't have enough money to even buy one. Duchess: Oh, well come down by my store sometime and we can come up with a dress at the right price and you can have it anyway you want. Rita: I was about to take Georgette to my room for a little girl talk, any of you ladies want to join? The husbands chuckled. Dodger: Go ahead, you ladies could use some alone time. How about we have a little cook out today. I'll fire up the grill and see if we have any burgers or hot dogs. Duchess: Oh, that's sounds nice. While the ladies went to Rita's room to talk, Dodger and the boys went outside and start cooking.[Chapter 3] Hey guys just a quick announcement I want to tell you guys a few things. One: I have a YouTube channel, two of them, the main one is the one where I mostly do reviews, movie reviews, T.V show reviews, and Thomas and Friends season reviews. The second one is mostly a gaming channel where I just do let's play of pretty much any sort of game whether they're new or old games. And from both of them I have a and so far not much is happening. I've done my best to promote my as much as possible, and I figured why not also share it on fanfiction as well. And I have good news if you want to go to my and donate a few dollars then you can get one or two things. If you donate let's say between $1-10, then you'll get, if I can find a way somehow, to read the next chapter or a chapter of a new fanfiction story, I think I know a why in which I can do that, but I'll figure that out first, if you guys know how I can do that let me know. Now if you more than $10 not only will you be able to see all of the new chapters and stories, but you'll also help me edited some of them and giving me your feedback. Yes you can help me out reviewing my work and edit any mistakes, which I'm sure they'll be a lot because I'm fast and it's a bit tough for me to read every single page and finding all the simple grammar mistakes.

Nothing too big, nothing too small. Just an averaged sized boat constructed of wood that lay silent in the night with a clothesline strung up outside and open windows to allow the air to blow in. It lay just as quiet inside where in different spots of the huge main room of the boat lay five canines in their beds made up of blankets and found scraps. In one corner lay one of the sleeping canines with a cheap alarm clock sitting right next to him which read the time: 4:29 AM. The digit on the alarm switched to 4:30 AM. It began to buzz as Dodger Herbie Tobacco slapped it off in time so it wouldn't awake the others. Dodger sat up, rubbing his eyes and stretching, realizing that his new day was about to begin. Dodger was an almost all white if he did not have the brown on his back and head Jack Russell Terrier with quite a unique personality. Dodger then glanced around the boat, making sure that his clock hadn't awaken the others, but they all continued to rest in their calm and quiet slumbers. He pulled himself up out of bed, throwing his camouflage uniform on for work that day and walked over to a sink in the far corner of the room, twisting the nozzle as he splashed cool water onto his face. He threw his wallet into his gym bag, slinging it over his shoulder as he grabbed his keys from a nearby table as he walked outside, taking in the cool November air. Dodger knew he only had a matter of time to arrive at the subway station so he could ride out of the city to get to work. He would often see his good friend Officer Argento in the subway station, mostly because Officer Argento worked the nightshift so Dodger would often catch him on his way back to his apartment. While most of the city went to work in one of New York's high rises, Dodger's place of employment was Fort Dix, an Army base over in New Jersey. Dodger attended Stuyvesant High School until he graduated his senior year. He had lived in an orphanage as a young pup, but as a child he often detested his time there due to the terrible conditions he and the other children were kept under and the sour attitude of the woman who ran the orphanage. Dodger has a very vague memory of his parents, the clearest memory he had of them and one of his siblings being from when he was four years old. He could remember his parents having a very depressed attitude when they realized that they just weren't capable of taking care of him anymore. So, one day Dodger had to pack up all his items and he remembered being dropped off at The New York City Residential Home for Children, and from then on he had to accept it as home. Dodger wouldn't consider his days at the orphanage as truly terrible though. It was there that he met another dog named Tito, whom he became great friends with, both due to their common interest in guns and wrestling. At the age of sixteen, Dodger decided that he just simply couldn't take the abuse of the orphanage anymore. So one night, when Dodger was positive that everybody was dead asleep, he convinced Tito to pack his bags and climb out one of the windows with him. It was on the street that Dodger and Tito were discovered by Fagin, and he took them in. Since they were young at the time, Fagin let them not worry about work or money, but as the two grew older, that began to hit Dodger as a priority. At the time, Fagin two other dogs. They were Francis and Einstein, both older than Dodger and Tito. At the time, they all lived in an abandoned and beat up wooden boat, and Fagin had the long term goal of one day, when they had the money, saying goodbye to the boat and buying an apartment over in Brooklyn. Fagin eventually told them that they could continue to live with him, as long as they supplied money to keep their home up and going. Tito went straight into the workforce and eventually collected enough money to buy a small building right across the street from which Dodger and the rest of his, \"gang,\" lived. Dodger attended Borough of Manhattan Community College for about a year, but suddenly felt that college just wasn't for him at the time. It wasn't until one day when Dodger was riding on the subway back home from the college that he found himself sitting next to an officer in the United States Army in his uniform. Dodger always had the military in the back of his mind incase his other plans didn't work out, and realized that if had an interest in pursuing it, now was the chance to ask questions about it. He tapped the officer on the shoulder and asked him about his experience with the Army. The officer, Howard was his name and was the rank of Major, answered all of Dodger's questions. Dodger asked him questions such as why he decided that he wanted to pursue a career in the military, and Major Howard told him that his father was a full-bird Colonel in the Army and that he, along with his father, served in Vietnam as a young Second Lieutenant at the end of the war as his father was over there as a Lieutenant Colonel before being promoted to full bird when returning back home, and he chose to follow in his father's footsteps. He told Dodger many of the benefits that an individual will get from serving in the military and the cool opportunities you will get to experience. Dodger asked what kind of cool opportunities there were, and Major Howard talked about getting the chance to go to Ranger School and getting to be in the 82nd Airborne Division. Major Howard told Dodger that he could tell by the way he was asking questions that he seemed to have an interest. He informed him that he was not a recruiter, but he had any interest in enlisting, he knew where to go. He handed him a brochure, and Dodger thought about the benefits and the opportunities he could get when serving in the military. Plus, Dodger had to face that he and the rest of the gang were poor. Their boat wasn't big at all and they had to pray for just the small amounts of money that Fagin would bring in every week just to put a little bit of food on their table. Their phone had been shut off many times because they couldn't afford to pay the bills. Their most primary thing to get money for was food for dinner at nights. So, the next day after his classes were finished, Dodger stopped by the recruiting office. The walls were lined with Uncle Sam, \"I want you for US Army,\" posters as well as pictures lined up on the walls of the recruiters there deployed in different parts of the world. The recruiter wore his green dress uniform with the rank of Staff Sergeant ironed onto the sides of both his sleeves. The recruiter sat down behind his desk and talked to Dodger and explained to him about the ASVAB and how whatever score you get on it will determine what your specific job in the military based on your score. Dodger looked at the uniform that the recruiter was wearing and spotted how he had a light blue shoulder cord around one of his shoulders. \"That blue cord around your shoulder,\" Dodger said. \"What's that for?\" \"Oh, that's because I served in the infantry,\" the recruiter responded. \"I've heard about the infantry before,\" said Dodger. \"This might sound like a dumb question, but what is it exactly?\" \"The infantry is all fighting on foot. If you do decide that you want to do infantry, you will get the chance to wear a cord on your uniform like me here.\" \"I bet you shoot a lot in the infantry, don't you?\" Dodger asked. The recruiter smiled and responded, \"Oh yeah.\" After that, Dodger enlisted, and the infantry was where he found himself. Weeks later, Dodger left for basic training at Fort Benning, and after basic training was over he got the chance to travel down to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for airborne training, and next thing he knew he was in the 82nd airborne division. He went to Ranger School a year later and the minute he turned twenty-one, he applied to go to training so he could be a member of Special Ops. Dodger didn't know how he did it, but when he went through special ops training he kept himself mentally strong and pushed through the hardships when a lot of other soldiers quit, and soon he was a special operations soldier. Since he survived the hard training, he was able to keep on living where he was without having to move states to attend the other bases in other states because a lot of special operations soldiers were based out of Fort Dix. It turned out that Major Howard whom he met on the subway that one day became his commanding officer since he was both an infantry and a special ops soldier. Soon, Dodger found himself going to Fort Dix every day for work. Dodger's gang was originally not so pleased with that fact that Dodger just blankly enlisted, but soon they seemed pretty proud of him when they saw him in his uniform for the first time at his graduation from basic training. Dodger walked down the steps leading into the New York City subway station. Even though it was very early in the morning, there always seemed to be people there waiting for a train. Dodger looked and sure enough, he spotted Officer Argento. \"Hey bud,\" said Dodger. \"Hey man.\" \"How was the nightshift?\" \"Eh, it was alright. Nothing too exciting. Some of the boys though did a drug bust last night. You won't believe this, but one of the users busted actually told one of my guys that some of the drugs that he had had come all the way down from Panama.\" \"People really risk going from Panama just to make sure that some drugs get sold up here?\" \"It makes a lot of money.\" Dodger nodded and then heard the sound of one of the subway trains approaching. Half a minute later, the train moved in, the loud squeak sound of the train echoing throughout the small station. The doors opened as Dodger stepped inside. Dodger smiled, waving to Argento as the doors closed and the subway drove off. Everyday always began with physical training, which was always pretty easy to Dodger since he exercised a lot and took care of himself. Afterwards Dodger's platoon would shower. Afterwards, they report to the mess hall for breakfast, or what the military refers to as, \"chow.\" Dodger and every other soldier in First Platoon wore their Battle Dress Uniforms or what they refer to as BDUs. This uniform was the dark brown, green and black camouflage uniform. Dodger got his tray and stepped up to the serving line as a cook behind the glass scooped up some pancakes, eggs and bacon and put it on his tray. Dodger grabbed some little packages of butter and filled his empty cup up with orange juice and sat down at a table in the mess hall with some buddies of his. Dodger cut a piece of a pancake and picked it up with a fork and began to chew on it. A private in Duke's platoon sat across from him and said, \"I wonder if we are going to keep on doing house clearing today.\" Sergeant Smith, sitting next to Dodger, responded, \"That and also airfield takedowns.\" Dodger and some of the other soldiers around him groaned because practicing to take down an airfield was something they trained for every day. \"Oh, won't you pansies stop complaining,\" Sergeant Smith said. \"Don't you guys see what this means? This constant training, they might have something planned for us soon.\" Dodger noticed that some of the soldiers around him started giving Sergeant Smith a curious, wide-eyes stare as if expecting him to suddenly tell them something exciting that he might have been told. \"I mean, I don't know about anything like that, I really don't. I am just basing this off of former deployments of mine where we were required to train for specific missions without being told why, and then we deploy and we finally get to learn about what we have been training for for so long and actually do it.\" \"Yeah,\" the private said. \"But why do they pick specifically an airfield for our training?\" \"Didn't I just say that I have no clue?\" Sergeant Smith barked. Sergeant Smith was a soldier described as being, \"tough as nails.\" He suffered from an abusive stepfather as a child and decided when he wanted to enlist when he was in high school. He claims that he hoped he would get the chance to protect people from terrible things like what he experienced as a child. But every soldier in Alpha Company, First Platoon knew that if you were going to be friends with Sergeant Smith, you could not have a soft and sensitive personality because he had a tough attitude, but every soldier knew that underneath it all he cared for everybody he served alongside with. Jumping out of a plane. Something people pay tons of money for, this was in these soldiers' paychecks. Everyone knew their part of their training exercise. Dodger's duty was to seize the mock air-traffic control tower down below. Dodger had done this so many times though, he could do it in his sleep. Dodger looked to his left at his teammate Corporal Johnston. Dodger took a deep breath to calm himself down, this being something he always had to do before a training jump. Today they were doing a static-line jump, a jump where you are attached to a steel cord above your head and when you jump out of the plane the cord you are attached to pulls your parachute out. Dodger and everybody else in the platoon also had a reserve chute on their stomach, but the military being how squared away it is, Dodger hadn't witnessed any accidents in any of his jumps. Major Howard stood at the front of the plane and then stood up and told everybody to hook up. Everybody obeyed and stood up, attaching their cords to the cable hanging above their heads. A jumpmaster stood next to the open door they would all jump out of. Before they could jump, Major Howard did a quick safety check and made sure everybody was strapped in right and then did an equipment check to make sure that everybody had everything they needed for the jump. There was a little panel at the front on the wall with a round red and green light with the red bright right now signifying not to jump. Everybody had to help with the safety check with pertained every soldier tapping the soldier in front of them and yelling their number and yelling that they were okay. This began at the end of the plane and continued up to the front. There were twenty men in Dodger's platoon and he was right in the middle. The check began and in a few seconds the soldier behind Dodger tapped his shoulder, yelling, \"Eleven okay!\" Dodger tapped the soldier in front of him, yelling, \"Ten okay!\" This eventually made its way up to the front and Major Howard was the first to jump out, followed by another soldier immediately. Dodger and the soldiers behind him had to run up to the front since the soldiers were rapidly leaping out, one right after another. Dodger was then up and he leaped out as the static line opened his parachute. He then looked down at the airfield 1,500 feet below him as he slowly descended towards it. After the training assault, Colonel Miller, as he always did, told the platoon what he saw when observing them with the training exercise. Dodger seemed pretty impressed with what the Colonel had to say about their performance. The Colonel told them that there were a few things here and there that he felt they should try to improve on, but other than that every day they seemed to be looking better and better. The platoon lowered the flag, and the day was over. Everybody got their things and began heading for their cars. Dodger saw Major Howard walking towards his car with his keys in his hand, so he ran up and caught up with him. \"Excuse me sir,\" Dodger said. Major Howard looked over at Dodger as he opened his car door. \"This morning at chow I was talking to Smith about all these things some old airfield training exercises and how we keep doing them repeatedly. Do you secretly think they are planning something for us?\" \"Well, I only know as much as Smith and everybody else knows,\" Major Howard responded. \"If I had to guess I would say maybe, but still, I haven't been told anything. I'll catch you tomorrow Tobacco,\" he said as he got in and started the car. \"Actually Dodger, where you headed to?\" \"Subway station,\" Dodger responded. \"Eh, get in. I'll take you there,\" Major Howard responded. Here Dodger was again, sitting on the subway just as he had done that morning. Dodger noticed that his days went by a lot quicker since he joined the service. Dodger put his gym bag around himself, stepped out of the train, and then walked up the steps leading up from the underground station. Dodger glanced around at lower Manhattan surrounding him. The two huge towers of the World Trade Center stood just right across the street from him, and to the right of him the following year a new fifty-six story hotel named, \"The Millennium Hilton,\" would be built. A sign stood out there showing a model picture of the structure and said, \" Coming in 1990 .\" And the Woolworth Building, the first skyscraper in New York City that was at the time the tallest not only in the city but the world as well until the construction of the Empire State Building in the 1930s stood close to him as well. Dodger stopped by a small Chinese restaurant on a corner, remembering that he was supposed to buy everybody in the gang dinner tonight. \"Thank you,\" he said as he opened his wallet, tossing a few dollars down on the glass counter. \"You have a nice night,\" he said as he walked out, carrying two full plastic bags with him. Dodger whistled a tune to himself as he walked down the sidewalk. For this time of the day, Dodger thought that the city sounded pretty quiet, but then heard a sound that sounded like it was coming a few feet away from him. Dodger couldn't make out what exactly the sound was at the moment. He glanced to his right to notice an alley next to where he parked. He heard the sound again. He believed it to be a whimper. Knowing he wasn't making the smartest decision in the world, he began walking down it. As he walked down the quiet alley the sound he heard seemed to grow louder each time he took a step. Another quiet sound emerged, this time the sound sounded like somebody was moving around. Dodger slowly approached a small, abandoned building up ahead with a large dumpster behind it and peered around it. A little boy sat up with his back against the building, eating soup out of a can with a spoon. The boy was dirty and smelled, wearing ragged, dirty clothes, obviously homeless. Dodger could see that the boy's teeth were yellow and his fingernails were dirty and unkempt. He had a winter hat on top of his head, filled with holes. \"Little boy,\" Dodger calmly said. The boy looked up at him, obviously nervous. \"Woah kid, it's alright,\" Dodger automatically responded. \"Who are you?\" the homeless boy asked. \"I can ask the same for you,\" Dodger responded. \"But since you asked, everybody's got a name, and mine happens to be Dodger. What about you?\" \"Me?\" the boy asked shyly. \"Yeah,\" Dodger responded. \"Timmy,\" the little boy quietly said. \"Timmy huh,\" said Dodger. \"What?!\" Timmy said defensively. \"Oh nothing, I like that name. I'm just curious where your parents are at Timmy.\" \"My parents?\" Timmy asked. \"You sure do ask a lot of questions kid,\" said Dodger. \"But yeah, your parents. Momma, papa, madre, padre, mom, dad, maman, papa…\" \"Madre and padre?\" Timmy asked. \"Mom and dad in Spanish.\" \"What about maman and papa?\" \"French. Well, whatever you call your parents, where they at kid?\" Timmy looked down at the ground with a saddened expression on his face. \"I don't have a mom and dad.\" \"Oh…\" Dodger said, feeling awkward and not knowing what to say next. \"Well, how long have you been living out here for?\" \"A couple of weeks,\" Timmy responded. \"A couple of weeks?!\" Dodger snapped. \"Yeah,\" Timmy said quietly. Dodger stood quietly, letting that soak into his brain for a minute. They both sat in silence for a few minutes until Timmy looked at the uniform Dodger was wearing and asked, \"Are you in the Army or something?\" \"Yep, 82nd Airborne,\" Dodger responded. Dodger figured Timmy probably wanted to begin asking him questions about the military now, but that wasn't what he could focus on. He knew he couldn't leave an orphaned boy on the streets of New York City like this, especially in an alleyway. We're poor though , Dodger thought. I'm the one with the best paycheck and I still have a hard time paying the bills. Dodger knew that he couldn't just leave Timmy out here alone any longer. \"Are Army guys nice?\" Timmy asked. \"Eh… the guys like me are. Some guys don't have a problem with it, some do. But, that's everywhere you go in life.\" Dodger paused. \"Here,\" he said while motioning with his paw for Timmy to follow him. \"So, this is where you live?\" Timmy asked as he and Dodger walked down a staircase into the main room on the boat where everybody had been sleeping that morning. \"Yep,\" Dodger said. \"We're all like one big happy family. We're a group. There's a girl who lives here with me named Rita. She and I have known each other since grade school, and I met Tito who lives across the street while living in an orphanage. The three of us were good friends in high school. We used to climb up on the roof and school together, go to movies, pull pranks.\" \"How did you guys get on the roof of your school?\" Timmy asked. \"There was a ladder. It wasn't that hard,\" Dodger responded. \"Hey wait,\" Timmy said nervously. \"Your friends… they're nice right?\" Dodger smiled. \"Oh yeah. Definitely,\" he said. And they walked down into the main room, the smell of cigar smoke hit the two like a bullet. Fagin, Einstein and Francis all sat at the kitchen table, lit cigars hanging from their mouths with beers at their sides as Rita and Tito stood talking. They all looked over at him, all happy to see Dodger but then the same level of confusion filled all of their faces when they noticed Timmy with him. \"Timmy, I'd like you to meet everybody,\" Dodger said. Dodger's friends were: Francis, a very light brown bulldog who spoke with a British accent. Francis was somebody who always preferred to be called by his real name and despised nicknames. He had a burning love for theatre and art. Dodger had caught him in the past mimicking lines from lines and TV shows he was watching. Tito, a very, very small Chihuahua with a very hyper personality. He always had a green bandana tied around his head and his left ear had a chunk missing, but nobody really wanted to know the explanation behind it. Einstein, a very far from intelligent dog, this being funny how this was even his name. He is a very kind and friendly character. He had light gray fur and was a big breed, actually being the biggest member in the group. Rita, the only female in the group. She was a brown saluki and wore blue eye shadow around her eyes. Dodger met her while they had been in elementary school and she had joined the gang later on in life. She had dark brown hair with two long side bangs. And Fagin, the only human in the group. Fagin had been described in the past as a, \"petty criminal.\" He wasn't a bad guy at heart, and he loved the gang beyond limits. Fagin would often maybe even have to commit small crimes to help get money to support the gang. He at times would be so desperate for money, he could be seen taking worthless junk to pawnshops in hopes of trading some of it for cash. \"Well,\" Dodger said, getting everybody's attention. \"Look who I found. This is Timmy, he's an orphan I found living in the street. When I found him, I thought, \"Well, he needs a family to live with, and we're just like a family, so why not ?\" Timmy slowly waved to them all and shyly said, \"Hi.\" \"Hi,\" everybody said, slowly retuning waves. Dodger put his hand on Timmy's shoulder. \"Yep Timmy, I'd like you to meet everyone.\" Duke pointed to everyone. \"Yeah Timmy, this is Tito, Einstein, Francis, Rita and Fagin.\" Timmy smiled. \"How long can I stay with you guys for?\" he asked. \"Hey kid, as long as you need to. Don't worry about that. Alright?\" \"Alright,\" Timmy responded. Hours passed. Fagin showed Timmy around the house and they allowed him to shower for the first time in a long time and provided him some clean clothes. They even mad a bed for him in the corner of the boat close to Dodger's bed. The clock that lay next to Dodger's bed read 9:45 PM. Timmy had crawled into his bed while everybody else left for their houses. Rita went over to go tuck Timmy into bed and hopefully comfort him, knowing that this was probably weird for him since he was spending the night in an unfamiliar place. Rita sat down next to him and began to run her hand through his hair. He smiled up at her. \"I sure am glad Dodger found me.\" Rita smiled and said, \"I am glad that he found you too.\" Rita kissed him on the forehead and stood up to walk away when he said, \"Wait, will you say a bedtime prayer with me please?\" She turned around and responded, \"Sure.\" She walked back over to him and sat down next to him. \"Do you believe in God?\" he asked. \"Always have,\" she responded. \"My aunt Jessica used to say bed-time prayers with me all the time when I lived with her.\" This sounded pretty shocking which made Rita automatically want to ask, \" Well, why don't you anymore?\" But, instead she said, \"Really?\" \"Oh yes Ms. Rita. Every night she would come upstairs and put her hand on my head and pray with me. My uncle Jason never did though. I pray for him a lot. My aunt Jessica would tell me that he was addicted to beer. I would lay in bed at night and listen to him scream at my aunt Jessica downstairs, and would sometimes even hear smashing from down in the kitchen.\" Oh my gosh, Rita thought. \"Where were your mommy and daddy when all of this was happening?\" \"I never met my daddy. He was in the Army just like Dodger is, and he would be gone a lot. My aunt Jessica told me one day that he apparently packed up his bags, told my mommy when she was pregnant with me that he never wanted to see her again, and then left. Didn't even bother to say goodbye.\" \"What about your mom?\" Rita asked, nervous over what he would say. \"I don't know where she went. She apparently gave birth to me and then apparently gave me to my aunt Jessica and then took off. No one has seen her since.\" Timmy looked and saw Dodger walking up the staircase holding a cigar and a lighter. \"Where is Dodger going?\" he asked Rita. \"Oh, just up to the dock for a few minutes for what he calls his, 'alone time,'\" Rita responded. After hearing that, Timmy got back to his story. \"Yeah, eventually I ran away from my aunt Jessica's apartment. She one day fell on the floor complaining that her head hurt and told me to call 911. Hospital people came and took her to the hospital. She had to go live in one of those special homes after the incident, so I was stuck living with my uncle Jason. He called me stupid one night and then hit me. He then drank a lot of beer and fell asleep on the couch. So I went and simply ran out the door and never went back. Sometimes at night I even have nightmares of him finding me in the city.\" \"Well, you have nothing to fear here and just remember that we all care about you,\" Rita said. He smiled. \"Here,\" she said. \"Let's pray.\" She took his hand in her paw as they both bowed their heads and closed their eyes. \"Do you want to go?\" Timmy asked. \"Sure,\" Rita said. \"Dear God, as little Timmy here goes to sleep tonight I pray that you will stand guard over him and protect him and keep him safe. God thank you for bringing him to us and God I pray for blessings for him in the future. We love you Father, amen.\" He sat up and wrapped his arms around her. \"Good night Ms. Rita,\" he said. She hugged him back. \"Goodnight Timmy,\" she said. She kissed him again on the forehead, smiled and said, \"Goodnight.\" Dodger sat in his fold out chair on the roof, holding the burning cigar in his hand as he exhaled smoke out of his mouth as he gazed at the Twin Towers towering over lower Manhattan and all the smaller buildings surrounding them. Rita climbed out of the rooftop access hatch and walked over, sitting down in a chair next to him. \"Dodger, we need to talk,\" she said. \"But Rita,\" he said as he put the cigar back in his mouth and then pulled it out and blew out smoke. \"It's happy hour.\" Dodger then leaned back against a wooden pole as Rita snatched it away from him and threw it. Dodger saw it splash in the river. He sat straight up. \"Hey!\" he said. \"The heck was that for?\" \"Listen Dodger, you will not believe what Timmy just told me!\" \"Was it really that important that you felt the need to interrupt me in the middle of happy…\" \"Yes Dodger, and don't start with that again. Timmy, I… It sounds like he was abused by an alcoholic.\" \"What?!\" Dodger said. \"What makes you think that?\" \"Well, he asked me to say a bedtime prayer with him and then tells me about his aunt Jessica and how she used to pray with him every night before bed but his uncle who he described as being, 'addicted to beer,' never would and how he could hear crashing coming from downstairs. His aunt Jessica ended up having a stroke resulting in her going away and him having to live with his abusive uncle and he ended up hitting him, so he ran away from there. He even said that he has nightmares of this crazed uncle finding him here in the city.\" \"Oh geez,\" Dodger blurted as he then walked over to the end of the dock and sat down, legs dangling off the side as he looked down at the water below him. Rita walked over and sat next to him. \"Can I be honest with you about something Dodger?\" she asked. Dodger nodded, not saying a word. \"I just worry about how we will be able to take care of him. I mean, look at us. We are barely able to take care of ourselves, much less a child. Do we even have what it takes to raise a little boy, to make him into a good man?\" Dodger continued to stare down at the sidewalk below him. \"I don't know Rita, I really don't.\" He then looked up at her. \"I mean… I practically raised myself, and I guess I turned out alright.\" Dodger paused and took a breath. \"Yeah well,\" he said. \"You never know. Maybe we will find some rich family who might adopt Timmy.\" \"I can care less about them being rich,\" Rita said. \"If we can find Timmy a family, I want them to be good, Christian people.\" \"Yeah, you're right,\" Dodger said as he looked back down at the ground below. They both sat in silence for a minute. Dodger then broke the silence. \"Do you ever think past now?\" he asked. Rita looked over at him. \"You know, like who you'll fall in love with, becoming a parent, other things you might do in this world? I mean, I joined the military because of that feeling. I would often just lay there at night, thinking and thinking of my future, and I was disappointed in what I was able to imagine myself doing. Just walking around the city, unemployed, doing whatever I could just to make a few dollars, hoping and praying that Fagin would return with money so we could eat. I… I just felt so useless…\" Dodger then shot his head to the left and looked at Rita, and then, something happened. He stared into her eyes, and not like any normal making eye contact with somebody, this was different. He stared deep into her eyes, and she stared deep into his. Then, this love for each other that they didn't think they had that strongly for each other this way just seemed to grow. The whole group loved each other as a family, but this love was intense. At the perfect moment, they both leaned towards each other and gently pressed their lips together. Dodger wrapped his arms around her and held her as they kissed. They both realized something during this private moment: they loved each other. And this wasn't any type of crush, this was pure love. After a few seconds, their lips moved away. Dodger stared at her in the moonlight for a minute, thinking she was the most beautiful thing in the world. He knew that he purely loved her. She stared at him, thinking he was the most handsome guy she ever laid her eyes on, and she knew that she loved him. They sat there speechless, trying to realize the fact that they had just kissed each other. \"Ummm…\" Dodger began. \"You know it is pretty late, and I have to be at the base pretty early in the morning.\" \"Yeah, I understand,\" Rita responded. \"Well um… I guess I will see you tomorrow,\" said Dodger. \"I'll see you tomorrow as well,\" Rita responded. They both then silently, without a word, climbed back down into the boat together, leaving the dock quiet and empty as it had originally been.[Chapter 2] While everyone in the gang lay sleeping in their beds at the boat, Dodger was over at Fort Dix running with his platoon. Early morning PT. It stunk having to get to the base so early for it, but it helped Dodger wake up. Dodger was wearing the Army PT uniform: tennis shoes, black shorts, a grey T-shirt with the words, \"Army,\" imprinted across the center. Since it was November, they all wore a grey slick jacket over it with a lime green PT belt across their waist. After this, everybody would get showered up, eat chow, and get ready to begin their day as a soldier in the United States Army. Everybody ran in formation with Major Howard running alongside the column formation, singing the cadences. \"Momma momma don't you cry,\" he sang. \"Momma momma don't you cry,\" the platoon repeated. \"Your little boy's jumping from the sky.\" \"Your little boy's jumping form the sky.\" Major Howard suddenly stopped the formation, ordered a left face, and then put them at ease. \"Alright, what was that?!\" Major Howard hollered. The platoon looked around, wondering what he was talking about. \"Look gentlemen, I know its morning time, but still, you all sound terrible. Come on men, this is Alpha Company! You are all paratroopers! We're spec ops, we make the enemy scream by even the sight of us. I want Bravo and Charlie company to listen to us and feel intimidated from how we sound. Can we do that?!\" \"Hooah!\" the platoon yelled. \"Alright then, let's try this again. Right… face.\" The whole platoon did a right face. Major Howard ordered them to begin running. \"Left, left, left right left,\" he said, making sure their feet were hitting the ground at the correct command. \"C130 rolling down the strip!\" Major Howard sang. \"C130 ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP,\" the platoon practically yelled, sounding off louder than Major Howard. Up the road, two soldiers from Bravo Company were walking into base and heard the company. They both looked and saw the platoon running. \"Is that Alpha?\" one of them asked. \"Yep,\" the other responded. \"I know all those guys are in the Airborne.\" \"Yeah, well they will see what we are made of later today,\" he said. Dodger stepped out of the shower, dripping wet as he grabbed his towel and dried himself off. He walked over to his locker and turned in his code into the padlock. \"Man, all this training we're doing,\" Sergeant First Class Dustin Shane said. \"This could mean we get a mission soon.\" \"I wouldn't put too much hope into it,\" Master Sergeant Corn said. \"We're just doing what we always train for.\" \"Actually, I could disagree with that,\" the First Sergeant said. \"Before we got deployed, they made me and my guys train and train for certain things and we had no clue what we were training for.\" \"Well, I know that the Command Sergeant Major has deployed countless times. He can tell us,\" Dustine said. \"I mean, he was in Vietnam for crying out loud.\" The First Sergeant shrugged. \"I was in Vietnam. You saying that I couldn't tell you anything about deployment?\" \"No… I take it back…\" The First Sergeant laughed. \"I'm just screwing with you.\" He took his sweaty army t-shirt off. \"Don't take it so seriously,\" he said as he threw it as Dustine. Dustine accidently caught it and quickly threw it back. \"Really First Sergeant? I just got out of the shower!\" \"Ah, suck it up. You're about to get dirty again anyways…\" Heslin suddenly walked in, dressed in his battle dress uniform and yelled, \"Everybody listen up!\" All the joking and laughing stopped. \"Major Howard wants us in formation in ten minutes.\" He stepped out as everybody went back along their way. Dodger giggled to himself, finding it difficult to take Heslin seriously. The platoon stood in formation, everybody dressed in their battle dress uniforms. The Command Sergeant Major stood at the front of the formation, and once he saw Major Howard approaching called the company to attention. Major Howard walked up, smiling and said, \"at ease.\" \"Alright,\" he announced. \"I have some good news. Today we will not be doing an airport takeover. Instead, the Colonel had something else in store. As we all know, I love to win, and I know you all love to win. I think you all are a very good platoon, if not the best every platoon to ever exist in the United States Army. So today, the Colonel wants us to go up against Bravo Company. \"We will use our average weapons, except for what we have almost all seen, the weapons will have an orange tip, and we will all be wearing vests. If you are shot, your vest will make a sound. And trust me when I say this, I do not want to hear any vest sounds today. Any questions?\" \"Excuse me sir,\" Private Jack yelled. \"Is it true that the Colonel is thinking about promoting you?\" \"Yes, I have been told that but they haven't given me any confirmation on it yet,\" Major Howard responded. \"If we do well like I know we will do today, you maggots might be calling me Lieutenant Howard soon.\" \"Dang, how many times did you have to sleep with the Colonel to get that?\" Corporal Jones said. The platoon burst out laughing. \"Alright, very funny,\" Major Howard said. \"But seriously ladies, this is going to be just like what we train for every day. We practice actually taking over a hostile target so much, now it is time to practice engaging against live enemies.\" Dodger put his Kevlar helmet on his head and tightened the chinstrap. He then threw his great big bullet-proof vest on with censors inside so when he was shot the vest would sound. He had his M-16 rifle with the orange tip at the end of the barrel slung over his shoulder. \"You know, when my daughter brings her first boyfriend home,\" Johnston said, picking up his rifle and slinging it across him. \"I know what I'm showing up at the door with.\" Dodger laughed. \"You just keep telling yourself that,\" he said. \"What about you Dodger?\" Johnston asked. \"I know you're young now, but age does come quickly. You ever want to have a daughter? Or a son?\" \"I mean, it is something I have always certainly thought about,\" Dodger responded. \"But I just don't think I am ready for that yet. I feel like there are things about myself I need to fix first before I raise a child.\" \"I can respect that,\" Johnston repeated. Dodger and Johnston then walked outside to discuss the plan for the training exercise with Major Howard. Major Howard laid a map across a table. \"So, Bravo Company is going to come marching up this road.\" Major Howard then circled the dirt road in the map with a pencil. \"They want to take the top of this hill, but we're not going to let them. We are going to execute a deliberate, organized and planned ambush.\" \"What kind of ambush were you thinking sir?\" the First Sergeant asked. \"Well, this is going to be the first time I would have ever used this type of method, but I was thinking of a triangle type.\" He pointed his pencil to the road Bravo Company would come marching up. On each side of the road were wooded areas and then ahead the road had a sharp right turn and in front of the sharp turn was another wooded area. \"Where is Sergeant Stewart at?\" Major Howard asked. \"Right here sir.\" \"Stewart, you're a good shot.\" Major Howard circled the area of the woods to the left of the trail. \"I am going to position you here.\" \"Hooah sir,\" Sergeant Stewart responded. Sergeant Stewart was indeed a good shooter. His father was a Marine sniper while deployed in Vietnam. As a teenager, Stewart was always asked by friends to go shooting with them at their houses or to go hunting with them. But Stewart's father, knowing their lack of firearms safety and skill, never permitted him to do so. He often told Stewart that if he was going to learn to shoot, then he would be taught the responsible way. Because of his father's training, Stewart became a safe and responsible shooter, and even entered marksmanship competitions, blowing people's minds over his amazing ability. \"Corporal Lucan,\" Major Howard said. \"Here sir,\" Lucan responded. Major Howard drew a circle to the right of the road. \"Lucan, I want you to take this position here.\" \"Hooah sir,\" said Lucan. \"Now the rest of us are going to be spread out in this area,\" Howard said as he circled the wooded area right in front of where the road curves. \"For Stewart and Lucan, I will communicate with you both over radio. You both are going to be the snipers for this training exercise. Over the radio, I will watch out for the upcoming platoon, and I will tell you both when to fire.\" \"Hooah,\" they both said. \"Alright then,\" Major Howard announced. \"Let's move.\" Dodger carried his rifle while walking through the quiet woods. The only sound was the pretty sound of the birds chirping and singing, then the boring and interrupting sound of the boots on the soldiers' feet crunching the ground below them. Dodger looked to his left to see the First Sergeant walking beside him. \"Was Vietnam like this at all?\" Dodger asked. \"Eh, it was different wooded terrain, only here we don't have boobytraps that you might step on.\" Dodger stopped and looked at the medium sized hill standing before them. \"This is the mountain Major Howard was talking about?\" he asked. \"Looks like it,\" the First Sergeant said as he began to march up it. Dodger then began his hike up the hill. The hill couldn't have been more than seventy feet. Dodger was almost to the top when he noticed Major Howard standing up there. Major Howard held binoculars up to his eyes, observing the ground below them. Dodger was able to see a great aerial view of the road below them and he could see the wooded areas in the side almost perfectly. Private Noch wore a radio on his back. Major Howard grabbed the microphone and spoke into it. \"Private Stewart, are you in position?\" Major Howard asked. \"Yes sir,\" Dodger heard him respond. The road with the wooded areas on each side looked to be at least two hundred feet away. \"Can you give some sort of signal that way I can see you?\" Major Howard asked. \"Here, I'll wave.\" Major Howard looked. \"Okay, I see you.\" Two hours passed. The rest of the platoon had spread out all over the hill. Dodger must have dozed off because he found himself going into a dream state when he felt the First Sergeant shake him awake. \"Dodger wake up.\" \"Huh?\" he moaned as he opened his eyes. \"They're coming.\" Dodger looked closely on the road and sure enough, Bravo Company came marching along down it. Dodger thought it was pretty cool how the weapon worked. The weapon was loaded with dummy roads with gunpowder that would still explode and the weapon did still have recoil, only instead of a bullet flying out of the barrel a laser shot out. Dodger picked the rifle up, aiming it at the formation. He closed one eye, staring straight through the sight system, and switched the safety off with his thumb. The company looked to be marching on formation down the road, but were mostly spread out a bit. Many soldiers every few seconds would raise their rifles and scan the perimeter while walking. A captain stood at the front of the platoon, looking around the area for anything suspicious. \"Stewart,\" Major Howard whispered into the radio. \"I want you to take out the captain.\" \"Hooah,\" Steward responded. \"Lucan, I want you to take out the platoon leader. After that, fire at the closest soldier.\" \"Hooah,\" Lucan responded. Duke felt his heartrate soar, adrenaline pumping through his veins as he knew at any second he would have to pull the trigger. Finally, Major Howard ordered, \"fire.\" At the exact same time, the two snipers fired. At Fort Dix, you were ordered to raise up your right hand if you were shot and then proceed to walk off the battlefield. Dodger watched as the captain's face below suddenly switched from bored to shocked as his vest began to sound. The same happened to the platoon leader. Suddenly, the platoon below quickly spread out, taking cover behind trees or anything else they could find. The rest of Dodger's platoon proceeded to begin firing. Dodger picked off a squad leader below. One soldier below got flat down on the ground, firing up at the hill. Dodger took a deep breath, calmed himself down, and fired. Sure enough, the soldier's vest sounded as he got up and walked off the battlefield. Gunfire was sounding from all around Dodger. Eventually, some of the soldiers in Bravo company realized where their incoming shots had been fired from as they began firing towards the top of the hill. Master Sergeant Corn, probably not even twenty feet from Dodger, vest began to sound. He held up his right arm and walked down the field. Dodger looked and noticed that some soldiers must have changed positions without being caught and were beginning to move up the hill. \"I'm going down, cover me!\" Dodger yelled to the First Sergeant. Dodger aimed his rifle down the hill and began to run down it. He ran right by Dustine. \"They're coming up. I'm going to stop them,\" Dodger said. Dustine nodded as he got up, following Dodger. They both got behind two of the biggest trees they could spot. Dodger glanced and noticed Dustine was behind a tree that appeared to be about ten feet away from him. Seconds later, soldiers from Bravo company came storming towards them. Dodger switched his rifle back to semi-automatic, dropping the magazine as he grabbed a new one, slapping it into the rifle as he hit the slide release. Dodger glanced over at Dustine who then gave him thumbs up. Dodger and Dustine then came out from behind the trees, unloading as many rounds as they could into the opposing team. Three soldiers from Bravo stood about twenty feet away from them. Dodger shot one of them twice and would have taken out another, but Dustine had already shot Dodger's next target. The soldiers gave Dodger and Dustine dreaded looks as they then proceeded to walk off the field. Major Howard was impressed with how the ambush had gone. \"We would have probably taken all those maggots out hadn't a few of them retreated,\" Major Howard told the platoon. \"I'm impressed though. A platoon going against a company and we win. Hell, I don't know why I don't go out now and buy a beer for each of you grunts.\" Major Howard glanced down at his watch. \"Alright, we have about ten minutes until I dismiss you all. Before we all go home, I just have a few last words. Pretty good day, hooah?\" \"HOOAH!\" the platoon screamed. Major Howard laughed. \"Now that, that is what I like to hear. So listen.\" He cleared his throat. \"Listen guys, I hear what is going around. I know that you guys are excited, thinking we might get a deployment soon because of all this advanced training, but just know that I don't know any more than you all do. They might have something planned for us, they might not. But anyways guys, it's Friday. Go home, chill out, and try to not think too much about all this. Hooah?\" \"Hooah!\" the platoon responded. \"Hello gang,\" Dodger called as he stepped into the boat. \"Hey Dodger,\" they all called out. Dodger walked down the stairs into the main area of the boat. \"So Dodger,\" Timmy asked. \"How was your day in the Army?\" \"Oh, fantastic kid. You should have seen. So, my team went up against another team in a pretend shootout.\" Dodger, knowing he meant platoon up against company, knew that Timmy wouldn't understand the military terms used, so he just used team to keep it simple for Timmy to understand. \"Oh hey Dodger, Fagin might get a job soon,\" Timmy said. Those words grabbed Dodger's attention. \"Really?\" he asked in an excited tone. \"Well, he applied and the boss said he would like to interview him,\" Rita said. \"Really? As what?\" Dodger asked. \"A window washer,\" said Rita. \"Oh man, whoooo,\" Dodger said. \"I could never do that job, no way. Don't like heights.\" \"Dodger,\" Tito said. \"You have jumped out of planes over a hundred times and yet you say you don't like heights?\" \"Hey, farther away from the ground I am, the cooler I feel. That way it makes it harder to see the ground.\" Rita laughed. \"What?!\" Dodger asked, smiling. \"That's just funny,\" she said. \"That's like someone who goes deep sea fishing being afraid to go fish in a small pond.\" \"Don't laugh at me,\" Dodger responded. \"Every time I go to the top of the Empire State building and I look down, I feel like I am about to explode. Oh, speaking of the Empire State Building, have you guys eaten dinner yet?\" \"No, why?\" Timmy asked. \"Because right underneath the Empire State building is this really good pizza place I would love to take you guys to.\" \"But Dodger,\" Rita said. \"What about the money?\" \"Ah, don't worry about money,\" Dodger said as he pulled a hundred-dollar bill from his wallet. \"It's all on me,\" he said. \"Where did you get that?\" Rita asked. \"The Army pays well. Cashed in a little of my paycheck today before getting home. You all up for it?\" Everybody looked around, nodding in agreement and smiling. Everybody suddenly sprang up and ran up the stairs while Dodger and Rita remained at the bottom. Once everybody had left the boat, Dodger and Rita followed behind them up the stairs. \"Here we are,\" Dodger said, licking his lips. \"Little Italy Pizza.\" Dodger held the glass door open as they all walked inside. Rita was the last to follow the gang. She paused, looking over at Dodger and smiling as she walked in, followed by Dodger. \"Wow,\" Dodger said as he glanced around the small restaurant. \"What?\" she asked. \"I just would have thought that it would have been busier.\" Dodger shrugged. \"Apparently I was wrong.\" The gang waited in the small line to pick out what slices of pizza they wanted as Dodger grabbed and reserved a table for them. Tito walked up, laughing as he set down a plate with two slices of pepperoni and cheese pizza and an empty cup for a drink he would grab from a soda machine in the store. \"Look at this man!\" he said. Dodger laughed. After Tito sat down, Dodger got up, grabbing pizza slices for himself and filled his cup with Coco-Cola from the machine. He sat down next to Fagin and sat across from Rita and Tito. Timmy sat down next to Dodger, thanking him at least one thousand times. Dodger figured that with Timmy being homeless not even a week ago, he had probably been starving. The gang seemed to enjoy it for the time being. It hadn't necessarily been the food that made it exciting, but the experience of going out and getting to spend money on things, something the gang never got to do. Everybody sure did thank Dodger for that. \"Oh, don't worry too much about it. Hey, you guys ever want to do this every night, or even go places, buy stuff, I'll hook us up,\" he said. \"Hey Dodger, maybe you should be careful about how you spend your money,\" Tito said. \"Nah, are you kidding? The Army pays,\" said Dodger. \"Plus, Fagin getting this job, maybe we can abandon our boat and go live in an apartment right in the middle of the city.\" \"Dodger,\" said Rita. \"I hate to break it to you, but you do know that some of those apartments in the city are very expensive.\" \"Yeah, so what?\" Dodger responded in a cocky tone. \"So what?!\" Rita said. \"Dodger, we're not made of money! Even with your salary and Fagin's salary, that being if he even gets the job, those two combined wouldn't be enough to equal the cost of some apartments in the middle of the city.\" \"Rita, don't worry your pretty little head over something that the working dog here has under control.\" Rita growled at him. \"What?\" Dodger asked. \"Alright Dodger, you are starting to press all of our buttons,\" said Tito. \"Why?\" Dodger asked in a confused tone. \"Dodger, you are getting a really fun night and starting to spoil it,\" Rita said. \"Man,\" Dodger said. \"You know I have witnessed emotional people in my life, but so far you all are the worst…\" \"THAT'S IT!\" Francis said. \"Dodger, me and you, outside. NOW!\" \"But Francis…\" Dodger said. \"NOW DODGER!\" Francis demanded. Dodger got up from his seat and followed Francis outside. \"So, what do you want to talk to me about…?\" \"Shut up!\" Francis barked. \"Dodger…\" He began to breath heavily but paused and began taking deep breaths to help calm him down. \"Dodger, do you have a filter?\" he asked. \"Well, yeah of course. Sometimes when I feel mad I take a few deep breaths to prevent bad things from coming out of my mouth…\" \"Not that! I cannot believe what I just heard you say to Rita!\" Francis barked. \"What, the pretty little head thing? I mean, I would take that as a compliment if anything,\" Dodger responded. \"How?!\" Francis asked. \"Pretty little head, it could be a way of letting her know she is pretty.\" \"No Dodger, what you said pretty much means telling a girl to butt out,\" Francis said. Dodger took a deep breath, letting that absorb through his brain. \"Okay, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"Say that to her,\" Francis responded. \"That was the first thing bugging me in there. Number two, your cockiness.\" \"What are you talking about? I'm not cocky,\" Dodger said. \"Dodger, if you could have only heard your voice and tone in there. Dodger, I want you to answer this honestly. Okay?\" \"Okay,\" Dodger said. \"Do you feel that ever since you joined the military that you have basically solved all of our problems?\" Francis asked. Dodger sighed. \"Yeah,\" he whimpered. \"Are you simply just proud of yourself for that?\" Dodger looked down at the ground and mumbled, \"yes.\" \"Are you trying to get everybody in the gang to feel proud of you?\" Francis asked. Dodger stared, wondering how he should answer that. Eventually, he looked back up at Francis and responded, \"yes.\" \"Well then,\" Francis said. \"Let's go tell everybody.\" They turned around and walked back into the pizzeria. They walked back to the table as Francis announced, \"Dodger has something he has to tell all of you.\" Dodger sat back down in his chair. He took a deep breath. \"Everybody,\" he began. \"You know that I love and care about you all and I would like to apologize for my actions a few moments ago.\" Dodger took a sip of his drink. \"I know that we have never really had much money, so when I found myself making money and being able to support all of us, I suddenly felt very proud of myself. It made me happy to see you all react happily when I was able to bring food to the table easily, and soon I felt so proud of myself that I found myself wanting you all to be proud of me as well. With my cockiness, I think it was simply that I felt at the top, I felt like nothing could bring me down and I wanted it to stay that way. Little do I know what could happen tomorrow, and I might lose my job. So, I am sorry for my behavior and it would mean a lot to me if you all could please forgive me.\" Dodger glanced over at Rita. \"And Rita, I would like to apologize for my comment towards you. I realize just how inappropriate it was and I really hope that in your heart you will find forgiveness towards me.\" Rita stared at him for a moment and then mumbled, \"I do Dodger. I love you.\" \"I love you too man,\" Tito whimpered. Francis tapped Dodger's shoulder and said, \"we all love you man.\" \"None of us are perfect man,\" Tito said. Dodger felt blessed to have a group like that who cared about him to that extent and would always be willing to forgive him. He smirked. \"Thanks guys,\" he said. They all took the subway back home. Dodger sat back, leaning his head against the glass window behind him as the train sped down the tunnel towards lower Manhattan. The train slowed as they all gathered out and walked up the small staircase leading up to the street above. Dodger stepped up onto the sidewalk, looking at the construction site for the Millennium Hilton as the towers of the World Trade Center stood right across the street. They began walking down the sidewalk as they made their way back down to the docks. They arrived back minutes later. Everybody began getting ready for bed. Rita walked over to tuck Timmy into bed as he did the previous night and saw Dodger heading back up the wooden stairs to the dock, holding a cigar and a lighter. She tucked Timmy in and prayed with him, and waiting a couple of minutes to make sure he was asleep, she followed up to the docks after him. Dodger sat at the end of the dock and blew smoke out of his mouth. Dodger heard her get up on the dock as he glanced behind him. \"Quick year, huh?\" Dodger asked. \"I mean, it is going to be December in a couple of days. It feels like it was just yesterday when we took little Oliver in, and that was over a year ago.\" He flipped a cigar lighter out with the 101st Airborne Division Screaming Eagles' logo imprinted on the side as he pulled the cigar out of his mouth, dangling it over the flame to relight it. \"Hey Dodge, this cockiness of yours, you need to cut it out! Trust me, this wasn't the first time I have seen you act like that.\" Dodger pressed his cigar against the wood below him. As much as he loved smoking it, and the flavor changing since he just relit it, he remembered that Rita didn't enjoy being around him when he smoked, so he was doing it out of respect for her. \"Alright Rita, I need to talk to you about something.\" \"Alright,\" she said. \"Can you sit down?\" he asked. Since he asked nicely, she did. \"Rita, please don't be mad anymore about what happened tonight. But, that's not what I was going to talk to you about.\" Rita didn't look angry and was giving Dodger her full attention. \"It's okay, I'm listening,\" she said. \"You'll see how this will tie in with what happened tonight. You see, there has been a lot of talk at work about us maybe getting a deployment soon, but I can't promise because we may, we may not. Not even the officers know. Thing is that, I am kind of excited but a little nervous because I have never been deployed before, so of course I worry about the thought of if I am killed in action, so I wanted you all to be proud of the little things I did for this group in case of the event that happens.\" Dodger raised the cigar to his mouth again, holding it to his lips before blowing out smoke. \"Well, what about the cockiness?\" she asked. Dodger blew smoke from his mouth. \"I don't know,\" he said, shrugging. \"I guess I just got so used to the thought that you guys should have already been proud of me for bringing money home that I just let that simply take control of my character.\" \"Dodger,\" Rita said. \"We were happy that you went out and got in the military and were able to bring money home so we could get food and survive, yes. Thing is that even if you didn't, we wouldn't have cared about you any less. We care and are proud of you because you are you Dodger. You are a unique individual and we all love and cherish you.\" She giggled. \"You know, the first time I ever saw you in your dress blue uniform. Man honey, you would have never believed how proud I was of you at that moment.\" \"Wow,\" Dodger said. \"Thanks.\" She smiled. \"But Rita,\" he said. \"Just know that if I ever get deployed and if in the worst circumstance I do get killed, I've got life insurance. You guys will keep getting money…\" \"Dodger,\" Rita interrupted. \"You are one of a kind. Money will never replace you.\" He smiled. \"Thank you Rita,\" he said. \"And if I do die, promise me the gang will keep going.\" \"It wouldn't be the same without you though,\" she said. Dodger smirked as he and Rita walked up, hugging each other. He stood there, hugging her for who knows how long. He looked out at the city behind them, the lights on in the windows of every building, the sound of the honking of cars capable of being heard from where he stood. \"Come on, let's head back inside. It's chilly out here,\" Dodger said. \"COME ON LET'S GO!\" Major Howard screamed. Dodger glanced down at the ground, finding himself dressed in his battle dress uniform with his Kevlar vest over his chest, black boots on, helmet on his head with his M16 rifle cradled in his arms. He looked straight ahead at the Brooklyn Bridge leading into the city, the skyline of lower Manhattan standing behind it. Dodger glanced up. The sky was blood red as thick, black smoke arose from areas withinin the city. \"LOOK OUT!\" one of the men in his company screamed. Dodger quickly squatted down as a missle soured above him, making a large whistle sound as it struck the top of the Woolworth Building that stood infront of the World Trade Center towers, the top ablazing into red flame. \"SHIT!\" a soldier screamed as the top suddenly toppled down, causing the rest of the building to tip over sideways, leaving a large cloud of dust to float about. Major Howard squatted down, raising his rifle as he fired rounds off at the bridge. He turned, glaring at Dodger. \"Start shooting Tobacco! They're coming across the bridge!\" A radioman ran up, squatting down beside Major Howard as he picked up the radio end, screaming into it that they needed air support immediately to bomb the bridge to prevent further enemy fighters from making their way across. Dodger looked about, noticing Rita, Francis, Tito, Einstein and Fagin standing there, watching him. \"Get out of here!\" Dodger screamed as the ground suddenly exploded feet in frontz away from them, showering dirt and grass across the area. \"This is not safe! Get out of here!\" Dodger screamed. He felt the ground vibrate as he looked out into the city and noticed the mushroom cloud of what had obviously originated from a nuclear weapon appear. Dodger screamed as the blast then tore through the rest of the city, causing all the buildings to collapse as it suddenly hit where they all stood. Dodger gasped as he opened his eyes, jolting upright. He looked around the dark boat, finding himself soaked in his own sweat. Everybody lay silent in their beds, sound asleep. He wiped the sweat off his face. He knew he had experienced a night terror. This hadn't been the first time that had happened, especially with all the talk of a possible employment coming up any of these days. He lay down on his side, lying there for what felt like hours. He glanced over at his alarm clock, discovering it had only been 2:19 AM. Dodger knew he couldn't possibly go back to sleep now after that experience. He stood up, heart pounding as he walked over to where Rita slept, rouletting in his brain whether he would do it, or if he should just turn himself around and go back to his bed. \"Rita,\" he whispered, gently shaking her. She moaned as she opened her eyes and looked up at him. \"Is it alright if I sleep here? I can't sleep,\" he said. She yawned. \"Yeah sure, crawl in,\" she muttered. Dodger smiled as he walked over, lifting the blanket up as he crawled in next to her. He closed his eyes, feeling his mind at ease now from the dream as he slowly drifted off into sleep. Rita glanced at him, smiled and then rested her head back down and went to sleep.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Tito walked out of bed as he walked over to Francis as he sat watching television as he always seemed to do. Tito walked over, sitting down beside him. \"Hey Francis,\" Tito muttered, exhausted as he proceeded to yawn. \"Hey Tito,\" Francis responded. \"Hey, um… Is Dodger alright?\" Tito asked. \"He has seemed pretty frustrated lately.\" \"Yeah,\" Einstein responded. \"He and Rita have just seemed to have been arguing a good bit lately.\" Rita walked out. Tito and Francis both turned, noticing her there. \"Morning,\" they both muttered. \"Morning,\" he responded. She walked over, getting a cup of coffee and sat down. \"Hey is Dodger alright?\" Tito asked. She shrugged. \"I don't know, he has just been such a jerk lately. I think that he has just been fighting this cocky attitude he has been having, and I think it has just turned him into something else.\" She took a breath. \"He told me two weeks ago that he would stop being this way. I didn't put my full hope into it though, knowing the way he is. But, I did have some hope for him, but you wouldn't believe what he is doing now.\" \"What?\" Einstein asked. \"He is acting like he is at the top and has even started acting like everybody is below him. He even said some bad things about each of us.\" \"What did he say about me?\" Tito asked. \"I'm not so sure it is my place to say,\" Rita said. \"Oh come on, you can trust me,\" he responded. \"Alright, he said he thought you were too rambunctious.\" Tito frowned. \"What about me?\" Francis asked. \"He said you were too sidetracked and sensitive because of your reaction if people call you Frankie or Frank.\" \"What about Fagin?\" Tito asked. \"Hopeless.\" \"Einstein?\" \"Clueless.\" \"Well, what about you?\" Tito asked. Rita sighed. \"Okay, well we're all family here,\" she quietly muttered. \"On this night a couple of weeks ago, Dodger and I were sitting on the dock together and we happened to kiss…\" She paused, waiting for a major reaction from them, but they all sat quietly, taking the news pretty well. \"Well, he told me that he only kissed me because he found me attractive and that's it.\" \"Geez,\" Tito said. \"When he walks in here, I'll beat him up Rita,\" Tito said. \"Beat him to a bloody pulp.\" \"No, Tito don't. When he comes home tonight, we'll confront him and tell him what is going to happen if he keeps doing this.\" \"Do you think he still cares about all of us?\" Francis asked. \"Of course he does. I think he is so tough about bringing money home because he cares about us.\" \"Well, when Dodger gets here, we will sit him down, and we will address this whole situation personally,\" said Francis. Dodger walked down the steps into the main area of the boat and noticed the gang had been sitting there waiting for him. \"Dodger, please sit down,\" Rita said. \"What's going on here?\" he asked. \"We heard about all the things you have been saying Ddoger,\" Tito barked. \"Like what?\" Dodger asked. \"Like that you kissed Rita only because you thought she was pretty, that I am reinbunctous, Fagin is hopeless, Francis is sidetracked and sensitive and Einstein is clueless!\" Tito yelled. \"Can I talk?\" Dodger asked. \"NO!\" They all yelled. \"Do you even like us Dodger?\" Einstein asked. \"Because if you don't you'd better just admit it now!\" \"Yes!\" Dodger gasped. \"Yes, I love all you guys, you all know that. You all are what I live for.\" \"Then why would you say all those things?\" asked Tito. Dodger leaned back against a wall, closing his eyes as he took in a deep breath. \"Because, I was mad at myself…\" \"Oh, okay,\" Tito sarcastically said. \"He was mad at himself so we all deserve to be insulted.\" \"STOP. Please just listen to me. I was mad at myself for being so cocky, and Rita when you were telling me the way I was acting, I secretly realized that you were right and I knew that I had problems and I didn't want to feel alone. So, I made it sound like everybody in the group had problems. Now I realize that nobody is perfect, so of course everybody has some issues. 'Tito, do I feel that you might be a little reunbunctous sometimes, not to hurt your feelings but yes. Francis, can you be very sensitive at times and get sidetracked easily? Yes. Fagin, can I sometimes think you might be a little hopless at trying to take care of the group? Yes. 'But hey, look at me. I am not saying any of this as an insult towards anybody. I just think that I was so angry and foolish that I kept on concentrating on everybody else's ups and downs instead of my own.\" \"Like all those tall tales you used to make up about yourself?\" Tito asked. \"Exactly!\" Dodger said. \"Just like with me and my tall tales. Not to mention my cockiness. Dang, now I feel bad because I am realizing all the mistakes I have made, I don't know who I thought I was to insult you all on your errors. I'm sorry gang, I shouldn't have been picking on the only ones in the world who really, truly care about me.\" The gang sat in silence for a moment, none of them knowing what to say next. Rita eventually broke the silence. \"Dodger,\" she said. \"This is something that we have all discussed as a group and have agreed on.\" \"What?\" Dodger asked, afraid of what it might be. \"Just to clear things up, Fagin got the job,\" Francis said. \"Really?\" Dodger shouted excitedly. \"Wow, this is great. Now we will be making two times the money and…\" \"That's what we were going to get to, you didn't let me finish,\" Rita said. \"Dodger, we're…\" She closed her eyes to take a deep breath, unable to bring the words to her lips. \"It's okay, I've got it,\" Francis said. \"Dodger, if you keep acting like this, we will exclude you from the gang.\" \"What?!\" Dodger screamed. \"Dodger, we all love you, but if you continue to act this way, we feel that we have no other choice,\" Rita said. \"But… we're family,\" Dodger said. \"We didn't say you wouldn't be a part of our family,\" Einstein said. \"Dodger, before you joined the military, we all had to rely on eachother for one of us one day to be specifically picked to get the food. It is still a little like that now,\" Rita said. \"Only here's how everything goes. 'We collect any food, you don't get any. It belongs to us. Any food Fagin gets, goes towards us.\" \"Dodger, be fortunate you even got into the military,\" Fagin said. \"I haven't told anyone but I went into the same recruiting office as you last week to try to enlist in the Army, and I didn't pass the medical exam.\" \"Dodger, not trying to scare you man, but you don't know if you will be in the Army much longer. What if you get sent somewhere and get shot? Then you will be out of the military and back to your old self,\" Tito said. Dodger sat back in shock. \"Well, is there anything I can do to stop this?\" he asked. \"Yeah, quit the attitude,\" Francis said. Dodger looked around at all their facial expressions. He knew they were serious. \"Well I…\" he stuttered. \"I'm…I'm…\" He suddenly turned around and ran up the steps. Hours passed. Everybody did their casual routine as they got ready for bed without saying a single word, Dodger on everybody's minds. Rita had looked outside and discovered it had been dark for a while. \"Where do you think Dodger is?\" Rita asked. \"Probably sitting out on the docks where he is every night,\" Francis responded. Rita sighed. \"I'm going to go talk to him,\" she said. \"No,\" Francis responded. \"I've got it.\" \"You sure?\" Rita asked. \"Positive,\" he said. Francis walked out onto the docks, the freezing winter New York City wind striking him like a bullet. He spotted Dodger sitting at the end of the dock, feet hanging over the side as he sat, looking down into the water. \"Dodger,\" he called out. \"Come on bud, it's cold out here.\" Dodger didn't respond as he just continued to sit silently. \"Hey, you don't have a cigar with you,\" Francis called out as he walked over to him. Dodger continued to ignore him as he sat in silence. \"Okay look!\" Francis said angrily. \"Just because you're mad doesn't mean you have to be a….\" \"I told you I am not mad at you,\" Dodger suddenly muttered, looking slightly over his shoulder. They sat in silence for a moment. \"I'm mad at myself,\" Dodger muttered, taking a deep breath to calm himself from anger. Dodger cursed. \"I mean, you all are all I've got and I treat you all so terribly,\" he said as he put his paws up to his forehead. He sat for a moment and put his paws back down. \"My exclusion. I deserve it. Every bit of it.\" Francis knew that he couldn't argue with that. Francis stared at Dodger for a moment, and excluding what had occurred earlier, he hated seeing his friend like that. \"Well, I am going to go back in the boat. It would make me feel a lot better if you came with me.\" Dodger sat, contemplating the idea in his mind before he stood up and walked over to Francis. \"Come on,\" Francis said, wrapping his arm around Dodger. \"It's too cold out here.\" Three days passed. Dodger treated everybody how they should have been treated, not to be a suck up, but to show that he truly felt sorry for his actions. He would go to work as always, and when he came home, regardless if his day had been outstanding or terrible, he came home in a fabulous mood and was always happy to see everybody. He even spent his money on take out restaurant food just to surprise everyone. Everyone had certainly noticed his change in behavior and talked about it. Francis thought that Dodger's sudden change in behavior was just Dodger's way to try and get everybody to like him again, but other members knew how much he cared about them and knew that he was doing it all out of the bottom of his heart. Until the third night. This was the night that would change everybody's life forever. It started out as any ordinary day. Dodger would get up early for work, the gang would wake up about an hour or two later, and everybody would go about their day. Timmy everyday would stand outside, staring over at the New York skyline, begging if someday they could go visit some of New York's biggest tourist attractions. He begged to go visit the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center, Rockefeller Centre, and the Statue of Liberty. Rita promised Timmy that they would get him to those places one day, they just didn't know when. Dodger returned home later that day, and same as he had done for the past three days, had food with him for the gang that night. He had a pizza box that had imprinted on it, \"Best in New York,\" as all the pizza places in New York said. Dodger lay deep asleep in the middle of the quiet, silent night. A noise suddenly erupted, disturbing his sleep. He shook it off and convinced himself that he was dreaming as he closed his eyes and tried to go back asleep, but the sound continued. He realized that the sound was real and not his imagination. He opened his eyes again and saw that the phone in the corner of the room was ringing, something they didn't have happen much. He then slowly got out of bed and answered it. \"Hello?\" he said in a tired tone. \"Is that you Dodger?\" the voice on the other end asked. \"Yes,\" Dodger responded. \"It's Major Howard,\" the voice on the other end said. \"Oh, hey sir how you doing?\" Dodger asked as he rubbed his eyes. \"Alright. Dodger, we need you here at the base right now, uniform on and everything, and hurry.\" Howard hung up, not even giving Dodger the chance to ask what was going on. Dodger ran over to a small wardrobe where he kept his uniforms. He threw on his battle dress uniform and then put his black combat boots on. Everybody was awake now and was watching him. \"Dodger,\" Rita said. \"What are you doing?\" \"They just called me to the base. I…I…\" he stuttered. \"I might be getting deployed.\" That got everybody's attention. \"Do you know for sure?\" Tito asked. \"They didn't say anything specifically where I might be going. My commanding officer called and just told me to get down to the base and quickly.\" Dodger threw his Kevlar vest on and snapped it. He snapped his gun belt on across his waist and then put on his helmet. Everybody there had seen Dodger dressed this way for training exercises, but they never imagined they would watch him get dressed for war. Dodger stood there trying to calm himself down. \"I… I need to get to the subway station.\" He grabbed his green military bag containing all his personal supplies he would need in the case of a deployment. \"I don't think I can go alone. Will you all come with me?\" \"Of course we will,\" responded Rita. Everybody got up out of their beds to go with Dodger, not because they felt like they were being forced to, but because they all cared about Dodger. \"It is pretty cold out there. You all need to bring coats,\" Dodger said. He let everybody put coats on and then they left the boat and got up on the dock. Dodger paused for a second and looked at his boat home. Could this be the last time I see my home? he asked himself. He then continued on. Rita looked over at him as they walked. \"Dodge,\" she said. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah,\" he responded. \"I think so.\" \"My train shouldn't be here but a couple more minutes,\" Dodger said. The gang sat on two different benches. \"Should we pray?\" Timmy asked. \"Yeah, let's pray,\" Rita said. \"Okay, everybody get in a circle,\" Dodger said. Dodger, Rita, Timmy, and Francis sat on a bench together and Einstein, and Tito came over and squatted around their bench, making their line of three as round as they could. \"Who wants to pray?\" Timmy asked. \"I will,\" Rita said. They all bowed their heads and closed their eyes. \"Dear God,\" she prayed. \"As Dodger leaves tonight we all pray that you will please watch over him and protect him. Since we cant go with him wherever he is going, we know that You will be with him and please protect him every step of the way. Please keep him safe from our country's enemies and please, please bring him back home to us Father. Amen.\" \"Amen,\" they all said as they stood up. \"Hey Rita,\" Dodger said. \"Can I please talk to you privately?\" \"Yeah, of course,\" she said. Dodger took his helmet off and walked with Rita behind the stairs leading into the underground station so they could talk in private. Dodger glanced at a watch on his wrist. \"Subway will be here in five minutes,\" Dodger said. \"That's all we've got. Rita, I…\" He stuttered, trying to find his words. \"I…I have… I have been beating myself up over the past few days because of all the things I had said to you guys, and I keep feeling like you guys won't forgive me, and I am nervous about this deployment because of the thought of if I don't come back. I feel like you guys might hate me, but I fell that the only reason I really want to return home alive is so I can renew myself…\" Rita pulled Dodger over to her and pressed her lips against his. \"Dodger,\" she said. \"We have all forgiven you. The biggest question is whether you can forgive yourself.\" \"You know that I care about every one of you,\" Dodger said. \"I know you do, and we all care about you too,\" Rita replied. \"We were worried if anything, about you and we really did not want to see this behavior take control of you.\" \"Rita, when I come back, there will be an entirely different me. I won't brag and make myself look like I am above you all anymore. I will make my whole life revoke around you all. All the places Timmy wants to go, I'll take us there.\" Dodger looked back down at his watch. He had one-minute left. He could even hear the subway approaching in the distance. \"Rita, I don't think I can go,\" he said. \"Dodger, do what you feel in your heart is right. Go defend the country. Go defend us.\" Dodger kissed Rita again. \"Go do what you know is right,\" she said. The subway pulled into the station. They walked back around where Dodger put his helmet on and picked up his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. \"Wait,\" Rita said. \"Fagin, get a picture of me and Dodger before he leaves.\" She got next to Dodger and they bolt smiled for the picture, even though they were both faking it since they both weren't very happy. \"Everybody get in,\" Rita said. They all then piled in as Fagin took the picture. The subway doors opened. Dodger turned around to step in but then stopped. He turned around and said, \"I love you all.\" \"We love you too,\" they all responded. Dodger then stepped into the train as the doors closed behind him. He watched them all through the window. He picked up his right paw and waved. They all waved back as the train started to slowly move forward. Dodger set his bag down and sat down in a seat, putting his head in his paws. And just like that, he was gone. Everyone in Dodger's company was dressed for war. The whole company had their vests and helmets on with rucksacks full. Dodger looked around and would ask any random soldier if they knew what was going on, but they would all give him the same answer, \"We're being deployed.\" Major Howard was nowhere to be seen, probably discussing with the Colonel the situation at hand. A siren on a telephone police suddenly came to life and everybody was ordered to report to the barracks. Everybody then began making their way to the barracks areas. There was absolutely no communication with the outside world. The phones were shut off and the company was locked in the barrack areas. The Army was trying to make sure that absolutely no word got to the outside world. If somebody told anyone, even their own wife, word can suddenly spread like wildfire all over the place, and nobody wanted to take the chance of some of the country's enemies finding anything out. Major Howard eventually entered the barracks area. \"What is going on sir?\" the First Sergeant asked. \"Manuel Noriega, president of Panama, has been committing drug crimes for a while now. He has had loads of cocaine smuggled into our country for a while, so we have been ordered to deploy to Panama and stop him. Tonight, we will fly down to Fort Bragg, North Carolina to unite with some other 82nd soldiers, and from there we will hit Panama. Before we leave, everyone will go to the arsenal and get your rifle. We will quickly load our magazines, get our gear in check, and then we will be on our way. Hooah?\" \"Hooah,\" Alpha Company responded. \"Then let's get to it,\" Major Howard said. The company lined up outside the supply room so they could quickly go in, get their rifle and ammunition, and then let the next person go. Dodger stepped in as a young private asked Dodger which number his rifle was. \"Forty-seven,\" Dodger said. The private picked up rifle 47, which was an M16, and handed it to Dodger. Dodger grabbed the number of boxes of ammunition he needed to load his magazines and then got out. The company also grabbed maps, first-aid kits, grenades, magazines, everything they would need when they arrived in Panama. Hours passed. Alpha Company was just waiting around now for the green light to flu out. Dodger even dozed off in one of the room's corners and suddenly awoke and glanced at his watch. 2:18, it said pm the small screen. Dodger closed his eyes to drift off again but was suddenly shaken by the First Sergeant. \"It's time to go,\" the First Sergeant said. Dodger stood up, grabbed his rucksack sitting next to him, and followed the First Sergeant out. A line awaited outside the huge C-130. The back was opened and the soldiers walked up the incline to enter the aircraft. Dodger soon got on board. Seats had been set up for the troops and Dodger got to have a window seat. Howard stepped onto the plane and performed a rollcall and everyone would reply with, \"Here sir,\" after their name had been called. Major Howard told the pilots everyone was present and they could leave. The back of the plane closed and the planed moved onto the runway. Dodger couldn't stop staring out the window. Soon the plane turned and the speed of the aircraft increased enormously and soon slowly lifted off the ground. The plane flew straight and then turned and Dodger could see New York City far below him. He looked out at the Empire State Building, Central Park, and as they flew over lower Manhattan Dodger could see the towers of the World Trade Center towering over all of New York and the Statue of Liberty. Even though most of the city lay asleep, the huge infrastructures always seemed to be lighten up. But, below him in Lower Manhattan, was his family. Dodger looked down, looking for his boat in the docks but it was impossible to see because of 1). The darkness and 2). How small it was compared to how high up he was. Dodger took one good last look at the city, wondering if he could ever see it again. Dodger closed his eyes and sent up a quick prayer that the Lord would bring him back home. After his prayer, Dodger realized that if there was any time to sleep that it would be now because who knew how much sleep he would be able to get in the next few days. He snapped his helmet off, placed his head against the wall, and slowly closed his eyes. They would be to North Carolina soon to meet up with other soldiers from the 82nd, and from there: Panama.

Nothing too big, nothin"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Keep Holding On (House of Wax)","Author":"MysteryGirrl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536492","Passage":"[Chapter 1] **Disclaimer: I do not own House of Wax or it's characters. All rights go to the creators, writers, producer,or whoever rightfully owns it. I'm only going to put it on here this one time because I know I'll forget to do it o the other chapters. So, just remember :) I only own my OC and some twist I add to it. I will be changing some lines, but for the most part it will be just like the movie(with one extra person). Remember it is a fanfiction and it is the first fanfic I have tried to do. Plus, I'm not the best writer out there, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. I chose this movie because honestly I like it. There are people out there that don't but that's them. Also, this story I do have completed so updates will not take long. Well I guess that's it, just remember to let me know what you think! :) ** Chapter One ❉ 1974 ❉ A lady around her early thirties walks towards the the pan on the stove with boiling wax in it. Before reaching for the spoon in the pan she flickers the cigarette in her hand. She then proceeds to stir the wax a little before lifting it off the stove and turning around to the kitchen table. There she place the hot pan on top of a holder and once again flickers her cigarette before she grabs a ceramic piece which resembles a face. She then holds the piece with one hand, while with the other she gets some of the liquid wax and pours into the piece. She carefully begins to move the wax around the face looking ceramic piece. In front of her Is the ladies young son sitting on a high chair eating some cereal and also has some around him. The young boy then sets his spoon down. \"You are being such a good boy. Would you like some more cereal, sweetheart? Here you go.\" She says to him as she puts down the ceramic face and walks to him. She grabs the cereal box and pours more cereal into the young boys bowl then adds milk. Just as she was finished with the milk a man walks through the door carrying a squirming and kicking boy who is screaming. \"He's really being a monster again today.\" The man says as he carries the boy over to another high chair that has restrains on it.\" Trudy, god damn it, help me!\" Due the young boys kicks the ceramic face falls down and breaks leaving a wax face on the floor. The lady-Trudy- makes her way over to the man and boy. \"Ugh! Can't you be more careful?\" she asks. \"I'm doing the best I can. He's out of control.\" The man, who happens to be her husband, replies. \"Sit still. Stop it!\" Trudy says to the young boy who is still squirming and kicking. she then tells her husband,\"Please hold him.\" Together they begin to strap him. \"Stop kicking!\" The man straps his feet with leather looking restrains and then puts tape over them. \"Why can't you be more like your brother?\" Trudy asks the screaming boy. The husband then continues to tie down the boys hands.\" Be quite! Shut up!\" Trudy says with anger in her voice. Dried blood was clearly visible on the high chair were the restraint straps were at. Once the straps were on and taped the boy continued to thrash around causing the straps to cut into his wrist and draw blood out. On the other high chair sat the other young boy from earlier eating his cereal peacefully as if nothing were happening. As Trudy was finishing off the straps the boy scratches her in the hand. She then retaliates by slapping him across the face. ❉ Present Day ❉ \"There's a place in Tribeca for three-thousand.\" Paige pointed to the newspaper she was holding. \"That's too expensive. The money I saved up won't cover two months' rent.\" Carly said with a helpless look on her face. \"I'm gonna have to work every second I'm not in class until graduation. I stop from eating the french fry that was currently in my hand and look at Carly. \"Carly, don't even think about not going. This is what you've wanted.\" I say while pointing the fry in my hand at her. Paige nods her head in agreement with me.\" I'm not.\" She replies with some determination in her voice. \"Good. Because you know how proud of you we are.\" Paige tells her, pointing her between me and her. \" It's just an internship.\" She looks at us like its no big deal.\" Uhm hello! It's an internship at I nStyle magazine! I'm honestly jealous of you.\" I say not believing she's not excited about it. \" You know I've always wanted to visit New York and you moving there will give me the perfect excuse to visit.\" I add. Carly just laugh a little along with Paige. I've known Carly since sophomore year in high school. I was the new girl in school,she became my best friend and later introduced me to the rest of the gang. Which included Paige, Nick, Dalton, and Blake. Wade came into the picture not long ago maybe about 2 years ago you could say. Any ways she has always known it was my dream to go to New York. Now at 22 I'm really hoping to visit soon. \"Or would you rather stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" Paige asked her.\" No, thanks.\" She replies. \" Yeah, that's what I thought.\" I continued to eat some more fries as Paige kept looking at the paper and Carly sat there thinking. \"Hey, babe.\" I look up to see Wade make his way over and sits down next to Carly giving her a kiss on the cheek.\" Hi.\" He looked up at me and Paige and gave us a small smile which I returned. He then turned back to his girlfriend,\"Sorry, there these two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.\" \"Really?\" Carly asks him. \" There's no rednecks in New York.\" I point out.\" No. There's not.\" He said looking a little uncomfortable, which then earned me a look from Carly. I just shrugged my shoulders at her and continued with my fries. The table fell into an awkward silence.\" I'm gonna go see what Blake is doing.\" Paige announced getting up from the table. I looked at her and nodded I knew she just wanted to get away from the awkwardness.\"He seems to like that car more than me nowadays.\" With that she made her way towards Blake. \"Well, I'm out.\" I got up and made my way inside the building. Before I even reached the entrance I see Nick and Dalton picking on a homeless guy.\"What's up, Crow man?' Dalton asks him while also recording. I stand there shaking my head and roll my then decides to kick guy cup.\"Get a job.\" I faintly hear Wade mutter something about 'nice'. \"NIck!\" I make my way over to them and look at the man with a sad smile and hand him a 10.\"I'm sorry…..What the hell was that. Don't be such an ass, you don't know what he's been through.\" I tell the guy and then look at Nick and Dalton towards the end. Nick then grabs me around the waist with one arm and pulls me against him adding his other arm, which holds his beer, around me. He nuzzles his face against my neck and mutter a ' sorry' . All three of us make our way back to the table again with Nicks arm around my waist. I sit in between Dalton who is on my left and Nick who is on my right sitting sideways. He pulls me closer to him and holds me there. \"so, what do you think, guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?\" Wade asked trying to make conversation.\" Yeah.\" Nick mumbled not really caring taking another drink of his beer. I just rolled my eyes,\" Hopefully is good or it's going to suck if we had to travel all this way for a crappy game.\" I said taking some of the tension out of the atmosphere. I honestly don't know why Nick acts like that towards Wade. Poor guy hasn't done anything to him. But then again, it's Nick we're talking about. He only shows real emotions and isn't a shell around me , Dalton, and Carly. Well things between Carly and him are a little complicated at the moment so they're not in good terms. \" Dalton, don't film me.\" Carly said trying not to get filmed by Dalton's camera.\"What? I'm not doing anything.\" Dalton responded acting innocent. \" The red lights on, idiot.\" I told him and laughed a little. He ignored me and continued. Suddenly Nick leans over me and pushes Dalton's camera down.\"Put the camera down. She doesn't like people up in her face. She folds under pressure.\" Oh boy here we go again. I grabbed Nick's beer from his hand, took a drink and waited for it to begin. \"You got something to say to me, Nick?\" Carly asked. \"No, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?\" Dalton then stood up,\"You guys are lame. I'm out of here. See you.\" I stood up as well and grabbed Nick by the hand so that he could follow me.\" Yeah, we should go too, Nick. Come ya in a bit.\" Me and Nick passed by Dalton who was filming Paige and Blake making out and headed to a secluded area that far way. Nick leaned against a rail that was there and held me around the waist while I had my arms around his neck.\" When are you guys going to start getting along again?\" I asked him. He sighed and looked at me in the eyes,\" You know it's still going to take sometime.\" \"Well knowing you I don't doubt it,\" I smiled at him before getting serious again,\" But can you tone it down a little, please. She's my best friend and you're my boyfriend, I don't like it when you guys get into it.\"He leaned in and gave me a small kiss.\" I'll see what I can do.\" I just shook my head and smiled at him. We ended up making out until we heard Blake calling for us saying it was time to go. ** In my profile there is a section where I will have updates about my stories, so check it out to know when the next update will be. **[Chapter 2] Chapter Two ' Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year….' the announcer on the car radio said. We were currently driving down the road. Paige and Blake were both in the car ahead of us which happened to belong to Blake. ' ...as Louisiana and Florida….' Wade reached out to the button on the radio to turn it up. \"It's gonna be packed tomorrow.\" \"Speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man.\" Dalton complained and moved around trying to get comfortable. I had to agree with him on that. Me, Nick, and Dalton were all sitting in the back seat of Wade small-ass car. Though, I was a little more comfortable than Nick or Dalton since I was in between both of them leaning slightly against Nick's side. \"Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault….\" Aw! look at him sicking up for Wade. He is trying.\"...his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.\" Nope I take it back. Dalton decided to keep on messing with Wade some more, while I on the other hand was just trying to get some sleep.\"It's more like a 'shot wheels' car, isn't it? What did you do, go to a barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut?\" I honestly had to snicker on the last bit about Wade's hair, Nick also found it a little amusing due to his small chuckle. \"Shut up, Dalton.\" I said to him and gave him a little punch on his side, but I couldn't get the smile off my face. \"Dude. You hurt me.\" He said back teasingly. I looked up at Carly and gave her a small smile, which she returned before facing forward. I then, turned to Nick and gave him a small peck on the lips. I leaned against him once again. We were both bored out of our minds so we kind of zoned everyone out. That was until Wade spoke up again. \"What the hell is this.\" he said confused as he was looking at Blake's car up ahead that had taken a detour due to the road being blocked. \"Oh man.\" Dalton said from beside me.\" This sucks.\" Carly, then added. \"So much for Blake's nice little shortcut.\" I muttered. \" I hope he doesn't get us lost or I'll be pissed.\" I felt Nick's arm around me tightened a little as he still had his head against the window. A few moments passed before Wade decided to investigate where we were going. He then sped up a little, until he was next to Blake's truck. I just kept looking forward trying to close my eyes, when out of nowhere, Dalton began to yell something out and shook me and Nick to get our attention. \"Damn, yo, yo, wake up. Nick, Vanessa, wake up!\" He shouted. I decided to see what had him so worked up, so I straightened up and looked towards the direction he was looking- which was Blake's truck- and couldn't believe what I was seeing. \"Oh my god.\" I said while trying to hold my laugh. Paige's head was bobbing up and down in the area where Blake's lap was. It was completely obvious what was happening. Plus, the look on Blake's face gave it away too. \"Look at her, look at her!\" Carly exclaimed. At this point we were all looking at the two in the truck beside us. I turned to look at Nick and saw the amusement in his eyes. When I looked back Dalton had taken his camera out and was recording the scene before us. \"You're caught on tape!\" The other three tried to grab their attention, but failed. \"What are they doing?\" Carly asked. \"Is she flossing herself with that thing?!\" Nick then leaned over Wade and honked the horn causing Paige to stop her ' flossing' and look up quickly. She looked a little surprised and embarrassed while Blake on the other hand looked pleased and didn't really care. Nick sits back and takes me with him. I snuggle close to him and give him a kiss. Suddenly Carly's phone goes off. \"She's calling me….\" she says and then answers\"You are so busted!\" Carly laughs. She stays quiet for a while before turning to us,\" She dropped her lip balm.\" Carly tells us with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. I roll my eyes and scoff. Carly then changes the subject, \" So, what's up?\" She asks Paige. I decided to tune them out and looked up at Nick who looked down at me. \"I love you.\" I say to him with a smile. He smiles back and kisses me,\" I love you too, Nessa.\" I honestly couldn't think of how me and Nick were together. When we first meet and from there on, we never talked much. It wasn't that we didn't get along, it was just we never really got to talking and knowing each other. Eventually, it all changed and some how we became good friends and feelings were developed which lead to now. Now, we've been dating for three years almost four next month. I came back to reality when Carly announced we were camping out for the night and leaving early in the morning the next day. I didn't really care to be honest. We kept driving when Wade pointed out a sign that said 'Trudy's House of Wax'. \" Hey, wax museum.\" \"You like that kind of stuff, Wade?\" Nick asked Wade being an ass again. \" Nick.\" I muttered to him in a warning tone. \"Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes.\" Wade replied. \"I guess if you like things pretending to be other things. Which you obviously do. Right, sis?\" Nick said. \"Nick, stop. Don't start, please.\" I pleaded. He just responded with a shrug and leaned against the window again. I turned to Carly and mouthed a ' sorry' , she just nodded her head with a sad smile. We then continued our drive to try and find a place to camp out. Little did I know that our decision to do so, would change our lives forever. ** Sorry for the shortness this is more of a filler. Reviews are really appreciated! :)**[Chapter 3] Chapter Three ❉ Part One ❉ We continued to drive for a few more minutes before Blake decided to stop. We drove over a little bridge and stopped both cars. The place we chose was a bit secluded from the actual road. perhaps Blake chose it for privacy. We all got out of the cars and stretched our bodies. \"Your car sucks dude.\" Nick complained. I was stretching next to Nick and saw Carly give him a look. Dalton just made some weird noise and headed off to help the guys unpack. Nick, in the other hand, just walked to the front of Wade's car. \"Paige, Nessa come with me.\" I headed over towards them leaving Nick behind. As I was passing by Wade a patted him on the shoulder and said, \"You seriously need to get a bigger car.\" I didn't even wait for his reply and continued to make my way to the other girls. Carly grabbed a fold out chair-as did I- and Paige just had her purse. We walked to the front of Blake's truck to talk in private. \"Well?\" Carly asked expectedly. \"I couldn't. There's no point in freaking him out right now.\" Paige replied. \"As opposed to when you find out you are pregnant?\" \"She has a point Paige. It's safer to do it now and not way he has time to wrap his mind around it, if you really are.\" I tried to reason with her. \"Guys, I'm not sure, okay? He's been looking forward to this game for months.\" Paige said,\" I don't wanna ruin it by starting a fight.\" I was opening the bag that held the chair when Carly's next words caught my attention. \"Paige, he's not going to marry you.\" Okay that was harsh. \" What Carly, means is that we all know how his parents won't approve.\" I gave Carly a look. \"Who says I want to get married. Besides, I've been late before.\" That was true the first time it happened she was freaking out.\"When I know for sure I'll talk to him, okay?\" I guess that was fair enough and it was her decision not ours. All us girl then decided to sit down and just talk while the guys finished getting the things out of the cars. Well, all of them except, Nick. He had decided to go sit down by himself. He was by the cooler with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other. \"Yeah, don't help us or nothing.\" Dalton said to Nick. Nick just continued with his cigarette and beer. I just shook my head and turned to the girls. Once the guys were done getting everything done, Blake took out a football. They began to play a little game. It seemed like they were having a good time. \"Pass it! Pass it!\" Blake and Wade then, began to throw it back and forth while Dalton tried to intercept it.\"You don't wanna...too slow, too slow!\" Blake threw the football at Wade who missed it and it went over him. He was about to say touchdown when he saw it landed by Nick's feet. Wade out stretched his arm for Nick to pass the ball back. Nick just sat there and didn't move. I knew something was going to happen so I looked at Carly and we both stood up. Wade walked over after seeing that Nick, wasn't going to do anything. Right before Wade reached for the ball, Nick threw his cigarette away and grabbed the ball throwing it at Blake with force. \"Nice arm. I see why they gave you a scholarship.\" Wade said to Nick who bend down to grab his beer.\"Yeah, it's a real tragedy, ain't it?\" \"Yeah, it is.\" Wade said walking a little towards Nick. Me and Carly then decided to go to them before it got serious. I went up to Nick and grabbed his free hand trying to pull him back towards the chair.\" Come on, Nick. Let's go sit.\" He ignored me and just looked at Carly and Wade.\" Wade. Help Dalton, okay?\" She said to him. Wade then walked away. \"Bye Wade.\" Nick told him. You could faintly hear Wade call Nick an 'asshole'. Carly then turned to us and looked at Nick. I knew what was coming-another argument- and I did not want to get between them. That's why whenever they had their moments like these I just stood back. I sat down on Nick's chair, but not before grabbing the beer bottle out of his it began. \"You know what? You can be a prick to me, that's fine. But he didn't do anything to you.\" \"So you admit that you did something.\" I drank some of the beer and looked out to nothing in specific in the distance. \"I admit, according to you, I did something, sure.\" \"You dimed me out.\" \"I did not dime you out. When the sheriffs came and asked where you got the car, I said I didn't know.\" Carly tried to reason with him. This right here was the main reason Carly and Nick drifted off. A couple months ago Nick was arrested due to a stolen car. He's been upset ever since, and because Carly didn't help him out and say the car was his.\" I didn't even know it was stolen. You're blaming that on me?\" \"You could have covered for me, huh? Vanessa did.\" When I hear my name, I look up. Truth is I didn't really cover for him. When the sheriff came over to Carly's, I was there with her. In all reality I was too shocked thinking that Nick had stolen a car, cause I knew it wasn't his, and could possibly be sent to jail for it. Therefore, I didn't even speak a word. Nick took that as me covering up for him. \"You get caught stealing, it's my fault. You resist arrest, it's the cops fault.\" Carly began to list things off. \"He took a swing at me.\" \"Get kicked off the football team, it's the coach's fault. Mom and dad kick you out of the house, it's there fault. Can't keep a job for more than two weeks, it's every manager's fault.\" Okay damn, she's on a roll. I began to start feeling bad for Nick. She was listing all the bad things that have happened to him in the past year. I know he doesn't show it to others, but all that has been stressing him out.\"I'm surrounded by idiots.\" Nick said shaking his head a little. \"Hey!\" I say. Nick just turns to me and gives me a wink with a smile before turning back to Carly. \"So why did you come? To piss me off?\" Carly asked as soon as he returned his attention to her. \"Don't you get it? You're the good twin. I'm the evil one.\" Was Nick's 'great' reply. He turned around and was about to start walking towards me, but Carly's voice made him stop. \"Grow up. You are so afraid to take things seriously. I honestly don't know how your relationship with Vanessa has lasted this long.\" What the hell was that suppose to mean, and why am I being dragged into this? \"Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving good old Gainseville.\" At this point you could clearly see Carly getting upset. Nick then went to mock Wade with an accent, \"New York City. Well, I hear they got buildings as tall as the sky.\" He completely ignored Carly's mention of our relationship. \"Okay.\" You could see her eyes begin to tear up and she walked away. I felt bad for her she was my best friend. Nick turned to me and grabbed my hand helping me stand. Then, he sat on the chair pulling me on to his lap. \"I think you might have taking it a little too far this time bringing in them whole Wade situation.\" I said to him quietly while placing my head on his shoulder. \"I know…\" He sighed and hugged me to him more. \"But you won't apologize, huh?\" I looked up at him. He looked down at me and shook his head, chuckling a little. \" Carly's right. Why have I put up with you for this long?\" I asked teasingly. \"Because you love me too much not to.\" He bend down to give me a small kiss. \"True.\" I said before grabbing him around the neck and kissing him. The wind blew and brought this awful smell along with it. I pulled apart from Nick when I heard the other stop playing and asking what that smell was. Nick then decided to tease Dalton, \"Dalton, did you crap your pants again.\" I laughed and looked at Dalton who was smelling himself. \"No. I don't know. Maybe. I mean, I'm wearing my work clothes, so…\" That made me laugh more. Wade then decided to go take a look. He grabbed a flashlight and walk a little towards the trees flashing them. Carly stood up from her place next to Paige and followed him. \"Ugh! It's horrible.\" Carly said while swatting her hand in front of her, as if to try and get rid of the smell. \"Something's dead out there.\" Wade said . \"I agree with him.\" I said, but it came out muffled since I had my face hidden in Nick's neck while he had his on my hair. \"No, something's dead right here.\" Blake told him. \"We need to drink it back to life. Bless me, dog.\" He told Nick the last part. Nick moved me a little and opened the cooler grabbing a beer, then tossing it to Blake who caught it with one hand. ** There you guys go! Please, please review and let me know what you think, bye :) **[Chapter 4] Chapter Four ❉ Part Two ❉ An hour or so and a few beers later we were all a little tipsy. Some how between all that I convinced Nick to move to where the others where. So here we are now; Carly was moving the fire a bit, Paige and Blake where off to the side, Dalton was filming everyone with his camera, Nick and I were in our own little world just making out. We were brought back to reality when Blake sprayed Dalton's camera with beer. \"Come on, man\" He cleaned his camera and then proceeded to film Carly. \"Hey, pretty Carly.\" It was pretty obvious that Dalton had a thing for Carly. Every one but Carly herself could see it. Dalton in the other hand knew Carly didn't see him in a romantic way or probably ever will. I had once asked her what she thought of him. At first, she thought I was trying to get at him and went on to give me a whole lecture on how I was with Nick and that Dalton was his best friend. It took me a while to convince her that it was nothing like that. She finally told me she only saw him as a friend and that's all. I shook my head before asking Nick, \"When do you think he's going to give up?\" \"I don't know, but it's Dalton we're talking about. He can be pretty persistent when he wants to be.\" He replies and takes a drink of his beer. \"Hopefully it's soon. He needs a girlfriend.\" I say looking at Dalton filming Carly some more. Nick just laughs. Carly then stands and takes the camera from Dalton. \"Give me that….oh, and the tables turn.\" Carly then begins to film him while he's telling her not to. She films him until he walks into one of the tents. I laugh a little before standing and heading over there. I grab Paige's hand pulling her along. \" Look how cute you look on camera, though. You look good.\" Carly says. I push him down until he is sitting. \"I think we might have to do make over.\" Paige says as she holds a shirt up to him. \"Oh hell yeah.\" I say and grab a pair of Paige's sunglasses. \" What do you think?\" Paige asks about the blue shirt she held up. \" He looks like a smurf.\" We ended up dressing him up on a Yellow thin jacket, took his cap off, and placed the the sunglasses on his face. \"Look at that. You look fabulous!\" I said laughing along with the girls. Dalton just groaned which made me laugh more. \"Your coming out.\" Carly told him holding the camera and heading outside the tent. \"I don't know.\" \"If you don't, I will be so mad.\" I knew he wouldn't go out so I looked over at Paige and signaled her to help me out. Together we managed to push Dalton out of the tent so the guys could see him. \"He looks like Elton John, but more gay.\" Blake said from his spot next to Nick. I made my way over to Nick and sat on his lap with my arms around his neck. \"Hey.\" I say to him and give him a little kiss. \"Hey you.\" \"Elton John is gay?\" Dalton asks playing along. I pull Nick's hood back a little and then give him a full on kiss on the lips. He grabs me by the hips and pulls me to him. We forget about the other and continue to make out. I move a little so that I'm straddling his lap. I bring my hand to his chest and begin to rub up and down, as he puts his inside my shirt were my waist is not once breaking the kiss. \"Oh yeah! That what talking about. Give me some more of that.\" I pull my face away from Nick and look at Dalton who is behind me filming Nick and I. Nick just continues to kiss my neck while I flip Dalton off and tell him to get lost. Out of nowhere a bright light is flashing in our faces. I look to where it's coming from and could barely tell it's a truck's headlights. I put my hand in front of my face trying to block the bright light. Nick turn's a little to see what's going on then he looks away again. \"Who the freaking hell is that?\" I ask no one in particular. Nick bends down to grab his open beer, while still holding on to me. We are all the same positions as before for a while when Wade yelled, \"Yeah?\" Blake then followed Wade's actions. \"Hey, yo, man, you need something?\" None got any sort of response from the person in the truck. \"What does he want?\" Asked Carly. No one answered. This was honestly freaking me out. \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade tried again. \"Hey, come on, man, get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.\" Blake said waving his hand a little. I turned my upper body a little to see Carly getting of Wade's lap and him standing up. He walked a little until he was in front of the group. \"Can we help you?\" \"Maybe we're in his property.\" Carly tried to reason with the rest of us. \"No, we didn't pass a gate.\" Wade told her. \"You don't need to pass a gate to be in someone's property.\" I said. \"Hey, man, turn your lights off.\" Blake said standing up as well followed by Paige. I heard the other still trying to get the person in the truck to turn his lights off, as I looked at Nick who was clearly getting annoyed. If I was correct, it'll only be a matter of seconds before he does something. When Blake threatened to beat 'someone's ass' - in this case the driver - and get ignored and stopped by Wade, Nick lightly pushed me off him and then, threw his beer bottle at one of the headlights. \"Nick!\" Carly exclaimed from her spot next to Wade. Nick ignored her and made his way to the front of the group, while pulling his hood off, and stood there staring at the truck. Carly looked at me with a look that said, 'do-something- about -him' and nodded her head towards Nick. I just shrugged and shook my head with a 'sorry' look, because at the end when Nick got annoyed he was going to do something about it and there was no changing his mind. After a quiet minute or so, the truck backed away and drove off. \"My man, Nick, here is hardcore.\" Both Blake and Dalton were like praising him or something. Nick turned to walk back to where I was still standing. \"Don't encourage him.\" Carly scold the guys. Nick grabbed me around the waist and sat me on his lap. Everyone went back to how it was before creepy-truck-person showed up. Out of nowhere I started cracking up, which earned weird looks from the group. \" Why are you laughing?\" Nick asked. \"Cause...Dalton looked….soo tough...in that outfit.\" I said in between laughs. Everyone turned to Dalton, who still wore the outfit and glasses, before laughing along with me. The next morning I woke up to Blake screaming at us to wake up. \"Nick, Vanessa, Dalton, let's go. Wake up! We're gonna miss the game!\" I groaned and buried my face into the crook of Nick's neck. Then Blake decided to throw something at our tent. At this point I couldn't go back to sleep. I got up and kicked Dalton out of the tent he shared with Nick and I. When he left I quickly changed into a pair of dark denim skinny jeans and a white tank top along with my dark brown combat boots. I decided to leave my hair down. When I finished i decided to go with the girls into the trees to do our business and let the guys pick up everything. \"So, you and Wade talk some more?\" Paige asked Carly who was lifting her jeans back up. \"We're just in different places right now. He hasn't given me a guilt trip about going, so I can't give him one for staying.\" \" As long as you guys talk about it before it's time for you to leave.\" I told her and placed my arm around her shoulder giving her a reassuring squeeze. She just smiled at me. Then the wind blew and the nasty smell from last night came back. \"Oh, my god, there's that smell again.\" Paige said. We all covered our noses and looked around a little. \"I think it's coming from over there.\" Carly said and began heading in that direction. \"Carly! What the hell? Don't follow it.\" I told her. \"What? I want to see what it is.\" She then grabbed my hand and pulled me along with her. I turn to Paige who was following us and rolled my eyes. \"Come on.\" She said. \"I can't believe you're making us do this. Only you.\" Paige continued to complain while I was just trying to avoid throwing up. The smell got stronger the more we got nearer. \"Oh my god, I hate you.\" Carly still holding my hand turn to Paige and chuckled. Before we Knew it, Carly and I were both rolling/sliding down a small hill. I could hear Paige call out for us. Some how in the middle of us falling, Carly's hand slipped from mine. I managed to twist my body around-where I was facing down- and stopped myself. Carly in the other hand had no such luck. She landed head first in a pile of dead animals. Her hands were stuck up to the elbows in the dead pit. \"Carly! Vanessa! Are you okay?!\" Paige asked. \" Paige! Vanessa! I'm stuck!\" Carly and Paige both began to call for the guys. I stood up and went to try and help Carly out. I grabbed her by her ankles and tried to pull her up. \"Try to push yourself up Carly.\" I told her. \"I can't.\" Then the guys came asking for us. I saw wade come and tell Carly he had her. Once I saw that he did I let go. I felt arms go around me and help me up. I turned to see Nick's concerned face. \"Are you okay? What happened?\" He looked me up and down. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just some scratches. She had it worst.\" I said. \"What happened?' He asked once again. \" We slipped, it's all.\" Then a truck drove up to the dead pit. \"Hey is that the truck from last night?\" Blake asked. \"Not unless he fixed his head light.\" Wade answered. Hugged Nick's side and he put his arm around me in a protective way as we all continued to look at the truck. Then this creepy-nasty looking dude came out-not noticing us- and went to the back of his truck to pull out a dead deer and throwing it into the pit. Dalton then turned to me ignoring the dude; \"Hey, have you seen my camera?\" I looked at him and shook my head. He kid the ground disappointed. We then turned back to the guy. \"Hey.\" Wade called out. \"Don't you see that? What is that?\" Carly asked pointing at what looked like a human hand sticking out of the pile of dead animals. The guy turned to where she was pointing and walked towards it and reached for it. \"What is he doing?\" I whispered. I guess Wade was thinking the same thing because he asked the guy the same question. The guy the pulled the hand out and asked, \"Anyone need a hand?\" I gave him a 'what-is-wrong-with-you' look. \"I'm just fooling. It's not real see.\"He tapped the fake hand to prove his point. Carly walked away and headed to where Paige was as the guy went on about how he found the hand. Nick, Dalton and I walked closer to the girls. When we got near them Nick and I stopped as Dalton went to go ask about his camera. I buried my face in Nick's chest trying to not smell the dead animals. Wade continued to talk to the creepy guy and Carly washed her hands clean. \"Hey, you don't know if there's a gas station around here, do you?\" Wade asked. \"Well, I got some gas in the truck if….\" \"I need a fan belt.\" \"What?\" Carly asked him. I took my head away from Nick's chest and looked at Wade. \"Just busted.\" Carly scoffed and said, \"Of course. Perfect.\" \"How does a fan belt just bust on a parked car. Wasn't that thing new?\" Wade looks at me, shrugs and nods his head. \"Bo might have one. Runs a station in Ambrose.\" Creepy-guy said. \"Where that at?\" \"Fifteen miles up the road.\" Then Wade and Blake started talking about getting one in another town but Wade didn't want to leave his car alone afraid that the guy from last night might come back and strip it. \"I'll give you a ride.\" Creepy-guy offers. \"Are you serious?\" \"If you like.\" \"Well, yeah. yeah.\" Carly then told Wade that she will be going with him. Both me and Paige tried to convince her not to but she only said she'll be alright. \"Carly.\"Nick said. \"What?\" Nick took his shirt off handing it to her. Blake and Paige headed back to the camp leaving the rest of us there. I looked at Nick checking him out and whispered to him, \"That's a nice view.\" He smirked pulling me to him and gave me a kiss. When we pulled away we saw the guy checking out Carly as she changed shirts so we stood in front of her blocking the view. When she was done Wade grabbed her hand and headed to the truck, then they drove away. For some reason I just had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. \"Man, you just gonna leave like that. With a man who throws roadkill in a pit for a living?\" Dalton asked Nick. \"Dalton. You clean shit for a living. You shouldn't be talking.\" I said giggling. \" Yeah, Mr. Septic-Tank-Man.\" Nick added. \"What's the difference?\" Nick turned around to head up to the camp and I jumped on his back giving him a kiss on the neck. \"Well, I don't walk through it, that's one. That's a difference right?\" I just laughed at him and we continued our walk leaving the roadkill behind. ** A/N: Please, please review! **[Chapter 5] Chapter Five After getting back to the camp, and me changing into a new shirt, we headed off to the football game. We were currently sitting in traffic just waiting for it to move. Blake and Paige were both in the front seats,while Nick, Dalton, and I were in the back. This damn traffic was seriously taking forever! We were all bored out of our minds, at this point I just want to go back and forget about the stupid game. Nick had his head halfway out the window resting it on his hand. I knew he was probably the most bored out of all of us. \"Dude, it's over.\" He told Blake. \"It'll move.\" He said back. We all knew that by the time the stupid traffic moved the game will be long over. \"It's not moving.\" Paige told her boyfriend. He looked at her then said with a determined voice, \"We'll make the second half.\" At this point I was getting really irritated. \"Look Blake, the freaking traffic is not moving and I doubt it will anytime soon.\" I said raising my voice a little and sat back down in between Dalton and Nick. \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" We all began to tell him we needed to turn the car around and go back. He was the only one now that actually wanted to go to the game. \"Blake, turn the car around,okay? It's over. Besides, Carly and Wade are waiting for us.\" I said in a more calm voice. He sighed and muttered a \"whatever'. About half way back Paige called Carly to let her know we were coming back and not going to the game after all. \"Hey, it's me we're heading back…\" Paige said through the phone. \"...Traffic. Did you get the fan belt?\" I grabbed Nick's hand and started playing with his fingers, not bothering with Paige's conversation with Carly. When we were half way back to where we camped before I decided to take a small nap. \"Wake me up when we get there?\" I asked Nick. \"Sure.\" He replied and gave me a kiss on my forehead. ***HW*** \"Nessa….Nessa….Vanessa, wake up we're here. Come on, baby. Wake up.\" I groaned and looked around to see we were not at the same spot from last night. I turned to look at Nick who was standing by the open door waiting for me. I got off the truck and asked, \"Where are we?\" \"We decided to camp here, where it's not close to the roadkill.\" I just shook my head in understanding. I let go of his hand and walked to where Paige was while he went to pee. \"This one is pretty good. What do you think?\" I asked Paige, showing her the CD in my hand. We were next to the stereo sitting down trying to find something good to listen to. \"Yeah, it is. Here let me put it on.\" I handed her the disc and she put it on. Through the corner of my eye I saw Blake, Nick, and Dalton making their way towards the truck. \"Hey, Paige.\" We both gave our full attention to Blake. \"Yeah?\" \"Nick, Dalton, and Vanessa are gonna go get them.\" \"Why? We can go.\" \"Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving.\" He 'whined'. I started laughing because I knew what Blake really wanted. Sex. Paige looked at me with a confused look and I just shook my head at her. \"Okay.\" she replied \"Try talking to him. Okay?\" she nodded her head. \"I'll try.\" I stood up and made my way to the truck. As I passed Blake, I pointed a finger at him and said teasingly, \"Play nice.\" He just laughed and made his way to Paige. I reached the guys just as Dalton was giving Nick the truck keys. I saw that he was rubbing his chest. I guess Nick must have done something to get the keys from him. We walked to the truck and Dalton gave me a look asking me If I wanted to ride up front with Nick. I just shook my head, maybe I could get some more sleep before we get to Wade and Carly. For some strange reason I've been feeling a lot more tired lately. Oh well. I got in the back seat behind Dalton, then Nick started the truck and we were off. We had been driving for a good 20 minutes and the sun had gone down by now. I had my head against the window just watching the trees blur by. \"Just let me drive, b****. He gave me the keys.\" I got tired of the trees and decided to listen in on their conversation. When Dalton called the 'B' word, Nick put his hand on Dalton's chest and looked at him. \"Yeah, because he thinks I'm the one who stole the car and crashed it.\" After hearing this I sat up straight not believing what I just heard. \"Wait, what?\" I asked looking at Nick. He turned to me briefly and sighed, but didn't answer. \"You didn't steal that car? Dalton, it was you?\" I asked and smacked Dalton on the back of the head at the end. \" Yeah it was me.\" he said, rubbing where i hit him. \"Nick, why didn't you tell me? I thought we told each other everything. I would have understand….you know it.\" \"Well, what's done is done. No big deal.\" He said. \"Nick! You went to jail. What do you mean it's no big deal?! God, Nick. What about Carly? Your relationship with your sister, and a lot more with your parents, is shit because of that. Now you're going to tell me it's NO big deal?\" I raised my voice getting mad. \"You're the one that is making a big deal out of this, Vanessa!\" His hold on the steering wheel was more harder that his knuckles were turning white. \"Now let it go!\" \"Fine, whatever.\" I replied angry and sat back against the seat looking out the window once again. A couple seconds passed before Dalton spoke up, \"You didn't have to cover for me, dude.\" Probably feeling bad about mine and Nick's fight. \"Your jacket's clean, alright? Mine's already got plenty of stains.\" I knew he was looking at me through the rearview mirror, but I ignored him. \" One more's not gonna make a difference.\" Dalton just nodded his head. \"Where the hell is this place? Town's not even in the GPS.\" \"That's weird.\" The rest of the drive I remained silent. The guys talked a little, but I just ignored them. All I know that it was something about how Dalton wanted to know if Nick thought Carly and Wade would stay together. We stopped when we reached a washed out road. \"Is this it?\" Dalton asked looking at the road. \"Yeah.\" Nick replied. \"Well, should we drive through it, you think?\" I knew there was no way you could drive through that thing. So, I opened the door and got off. The town must be close, we did drive for a long time. I heard both Nick and Dalton get off too. Nick stood next to me still talking to Dalton. Who thought he could drive through it, until he got an unsure look when Nick tossed him the keys. \"That's what I thought.\" All three of us walked around the bend and saw the town, with a sign off to the side that said 'Welcome to Ambrose'. We continued to walk a little more, when we finally saw the station. Loud rock music was coming from inside. We began to call out, but got no response. I walked up to the door and took a look inside, but it was empty. \"Carly? Wade? Hello?\" \"Man, there's music playing, but I don't think anyone's here.\" Well thank for noting the obvious, Dalton. \"No one's here.\" Nick said and began to walk away. \"Where you going?\" Dalton asked. We followed after him. Dalton was a little ahead of me, though. \"To the grocery store we passed. I'm thirsty.\" He just kept walking and we followed. \"Well, what about your sister and Wade, man?\" You could clearly hear the worry in his voice. I know how he's feeling, 'cause that's how I'm starting to feel too. Nick on the other hand… \"Maybe they're at the store.\" We just stared at him. \"What?\" \"I don't know. We came all this way.\" Dalton said biting on his thumb. \"Don't you think we should look for them? Or is it not a big deal?\" That was the first time I talked since our fight. He just sighed and looked at Dalton. \"Check it. I'm gonna go this way. Go that way, we don't find them meet here, go back to the road. Cool?\" Dalton agreed. Nick then turned to me. \" You gonna come with me?\" I would have but to be honest, I just wanted to clear my head and get rid of the remaining anger. \" No. I think I'll just go with Dalton.\" He looked at me for a while. I guess he knew I was still a little upset. \"Okay. Just be careful.\" I nodded, \"You too.\" With that I turned around and followed Dalton. **I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS CHAPTER, WELL THE BEGINNING AT LEAST. ANYWHO, WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO DALTON NEXT (IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE), BUT NOW VANESSA IS GOING WITH HIM…... ? LASLTY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU GUYS FAVORING, FOLLOWING , AND READING! **[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Dalton and I continued to walk up the road. I was still thinking about the argument Nick and I had. I wasn't mad anymore, I just a little upset with the fact that he didn't say the truth. Yeah, I know it was to cover up for Dalton, and that was nice of him, but couldn't he just avoid all the crap going on between him and Carly if he just told her. Now that I think about, he's right. I can do anything about the fact that he already went to jail for it, but I could convince him to at least talk things out with Carly. When we get back, I'll tell him. \"Look Nessa, I'm really sorry about what I caused back there with you and Nick. I didn't mean too.\" I was brought out of my thoughts by Dalton's apology. \"It's okay, Dalton. It was more the fact that he didn't say anything. It wasn't your fault.\" I put my arm around him giving him a squeeze to reassure him, before pulling away. \"Plus, if he would have said something, then maybe Carly and his parents would stop giving him crap about it. They would have understood that he did it for you.\" \"Yeah, but I'm still sorry.\" I just nodded giving him a smile. We walked a little more before Dalton stopped. I saw that he was looking at the house of wax, but then kept glancing up the road. \"Maybe, they're at the wax place. Wade the mention it on our way to the camp.\" He agreed with me with a 'yeah' and we made our way to the House of Wax. We climbed up the steps and could see the door slightly opened.\" See, the door's opened. They probably are in there, come on.\" I said as I pushed open the door some more and walked in with Dalton right behind me. Dalton began to call out so I decided to join in. \"Hello?\" \"Carly? Wade? Hello?\" We walked around still calling out for them. \"This place is creepy.\" I told Dalton. The wax figures were all full of dust and they just plain looked scary. Seems like no one has been here for quite some time. \"It's a weird place.\" He said touching one of the wax people. \"Come on, let's go over here.\" I followed behind him a little still looking around. He entered some as I stopped to look at some little wax ballerina on the wax counter. \"Wade! What the hell are you doing bro? Man, come on everyone's waiting for you at the campsite.\" Upon hearing this I made my way to where Dalton and Wade where. I entered the room and saw Wade sitting in front of a piano just staring ahead. \"Wade, no time to play. Come on, we got to go. Where's Carly?\" I said. Me and Dalton both looked at each other when he didn't respond or say anything back. Dalton then got closer to him calling his name again. He poked Wade's cheek, but when he did the area he poked sunk in and looked mushy a in a way. He immediately removed his hand away from Wade's face. \"What the hell?\" I whispered when I saw what happened. \"Hold tight, man. Hold tight. I'm gonna get you out of this.\" Dalton said to Wade who seemed to be moaning from pain. Dalton began to peel Wade's face revealing his flesh. \" Oh my god, Dalton! Stop!\" I said when I saw a tear come out from Wade's face. I looked at Wade and saw him move his eyes from side to side. I was confused as to what he was doing. Then out of nowhere a knife comes down slicing Wade's cheek off. Both Dalton and I jump back and I scream at what just happend. We look up to see a man with long hair standing there with a knife in one hand. It looked like he had some sort of mask on. Dalton grabbed my hand and we began to run away from the man. \"Come on, Nessa!\" We ran into the dining room and I let go of Dalton hand to throw the chairs, to try and slow down the guy. Dalton saw what I was doing and began to throw other things as well. Dalton ran into the kitchen with me following behind him and the man following behind be, kicking the things out of the way. Before I made it inside the kitchen where Dalton was, I tripped and landed hard on the floor. I turned around to see the guy coming towards me. Where the hell was Dalton?! I was too scared to even move so I just laid there propped up on my hands. The guy got closer and closer, the closer he got the more he lifted up his knife. I began to breath heavy, then he stood right in front of me. He brought his knife up some more and then brought it down at at me. I screamed and put my hands to cover myself as the knife got closer…... ●○●◊●○● Meanwhile… ●○●◊●○● Nick stood in front of the grocery store trying to get someone to open the locked door. After once again trying to open the door he gave up. He turned around to go look for his sister and her boyfriend, when he saw a man step out of the gas station. He made his way towards him as the man was closing the door. \"Hey.\" The man turned to see who called and stared at Nick. \"I'm looking for my sister and her boyfriend. They were looking for a fan belt or something.\" Nick said as he walked a little closer to the man. Little did he know that his sister was just below him tied up to a chair and it was all the work of the man he was currently talking to. \"I don't think I've seen them.\" The man replied before walking away. \"This is the only gas station in town, right?\" Nick asked, as he took a glance around and then returned his gaze at the man. \"That's right.\" He said as he pulled down the garage door and leaned on it. \"Yeah, then they were definitely here.\" Nick walked around the gas pumps and stood facing the man but with distance between them. \"I just told you, I didn't see them.\" The said getting irritated and walked closer to Nick. \"Does someone else work here?\" Nick was not going to give up until he figured out where his sister was. \"No, I own the station. And I would've seen them.\" Carly who had was down below, managed to get on of her hands free, though it was still taped to the chair's handle bar. She reached up as much as she could could and stuck her finger out of the water drain, hoping to get Nick's attention since her lips were glued together and she couldn't speak. \"Well, I was here a few minutes ago, and you didn't see me. You weren't even here.\" The man was now standing in front of Nick, who had his hands in his jacket's pockets. \"Sorry. Can't help you.\" Then Carly let out a muffled scream getting Nick's attention. \"What was that?\" \"Nothing. That was just my dog.\" The man backed away and saw Carly's finger and knelt down beside it pretending to tie his shoe. \"Actually, you know what? My brother Vincent was down here for a while. He could've helped your sister. He could be up at the house.\" He said. Nick looked back at the direction the man was pointing , then looked back. \"No, my girlfriend and friend went up there earlier.\" \"Really? Well, maybe they ran into my brother up there, then.\" He took out some type of tool and cut the tip of Carly's finger of. This caused Carly to cry silently in pain while cradling her hand to her chest. \"Want to head up to the house.\" The man asked as he stood up putting the finger and tool into his pocket. \"Yeah, whatever.\" they began to walkway from the station. Little did Nick know that the man took out a metal filer from his back pocket. Meanwhile, Carly heard them walking away and began pulling on her lips to try and separate them and call out to Nick. \"So, what your sister look like anyway?\" Before Nick had a chance to reply, Carly began calling his name with desperation. Nick turned around quickly at the sound of his sister, but was meet with the man trying to cut him with the filer. Nick managed to dodge the attack and take a swing at the man, then he took a couple more before running towards the station's door. He got there just in time and closed the door right as the man got there and locked it. The man then ran towards the garage. Nick saw the direction he was going and ran to close the garage door as well. He got to right when the man was lifting it open. Nick then ran to it and jumped a little to be able to close it. Both men were struggling to either open the door or keep it closed. Nick then-with a little struggle -managed to get a hold of a screw driver and use it to lock the garage door. The man then ran again to where the front door was. Nick did the same but from the inside. When he got there, the man was gone. He looked around a little to try and see where he had gone, but couldn't find him. \"Nick!\" Hearing his sisters call out for him again, he went in search of her. \"Carly!\" \"I'm down stairs!\" Nick went down the steps to were a wooden door was locked. He kicked the door in and couldn't believe what he saw. Carly was there tied up to a chair all bloodied up and looked like she was drained from energy. \"Thank God.\" she whispered quietly. \"Jesus.\" Nick said as he approached his sister. \"Okay, I'm here. I got you.\" He tried to comfort her as he worked on getting her out. \"Watch my finger. Watch my finger.\" Carly told him when he was unstrapping her injured hand. \"Oh my God. He did this to you?\" He asked not believing someone would do such a thing. They managed to get her free and she covered her injured finger with some of her shirt. Nick began looking around the room, when Carly asked him where 'he' was. Getting no answer she asked again, \"Where is he?\" \"I locked him out. Where the hell is Wade?\" \"I don't know. He went into the house. This place is a freak show.\" Suddenly the sound of an engine starting caught their attention. Knowing that the man from earlier was gone they made their way upstairs again, cautiously. Nick told Carly to stay where she was as he went to go look for something to use as a weapon. When he found something he returned back to his sister. \"All right. Car's by the road. Damnit, Dalton's got the keys.\" After saying that realization hit Nick. \"Dalton…...Shit Vanessa's with him.\" Nick said as he ran a hand over his head when he realized that now his best friend and girlfriend could be in danger. \" We gotta call the cops.\" Nick made his way to the phone, but the phone wasn't working. \"Shit. Hey, where's your cell phone?\" He asked his sister. \"It might be in the truck up near the house. What about Wade? I think he has him too…..What if he turns him into wax?\" Nick turned to face his sister from where he was standing near the window. \"What do you mean, wax?\" \"You don't get it. They're all wax, everyone.\" said with desperation on her voice, trying to get her brother to understand her. \"No, wait.\" With that, they made their way out of the station… ** A/N: Here's another chapter, hope you lie it. Review! ** Zahra(Guest): Thank you so much for being the first to review and about Vanessa dying or not, we'll just have to wait and see.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven Nick followed Carly out of the station and down the street, after she remembered something. Carly was still cradling her injured hand as they walked up to a house with a nice little wooden fence around it. Nick just followed his sister, wondering what she was talking about. Though, in the back of his mind he couldn't stop thinking about Dalton and Vanessa. Vanessa the most. He was really hoping that they were alright and nothing bad happened to any of them. \"There was a woman in was alive. She pulled the curtain back.\" Carly told Nick as she walked up to the house and opened the fence. Nick on the other hand, decided to just jump over it. He stepped on a brick and took a look around before looking through the window. He wasn't able to see much, all he could see was the tv on, but nothing more. He let out a little scream and jumped back from surprise when an old looking woman with rollers on her hair pulled back the curtain. Carly then stepped forward and took a look at the woman. She looked at her carefully and realized that she was also wax. \"The whole town is rigged.\" \"That's impossible.\"Nick said just as the wax lady opened the curtain, once again. \"You're saying that's a real person…..underneath?\" You could hear the fear in Nick's voice as he asked. The more he thought about it, the more real everything became. \"At the church, they were all like that. At least 20 more.\" Carly said. Nick just kept staring at the window and the wax lady in it with fear. He turned to his sister and didn't know what to say. He was worried for his best friend, but he was scared for Vanessa, his girlfriend of almost four years. Thinking about her made him freak out a little. \"Shit, Carly. We need to find them. If this shit is true, I need to find her. I can't lose her, she's the only good thing that's happened to me!\" Carly could clearly see the effect all this was having on her brother. Yes, he was strong and knew how to handle situations, but knowing that the person he loves could be dead, was just eating at him. Carly now knew how important her best friend was to her brother. Nick paced back and forth running his hands over his face and hair a few times. He was trying to come up with some sort of plan that will help, and hopefully get his girlfriend back to him safely. \"Nick, we'll find them. Don't lose hope.\" Carly tried to comfort her twin. \"Yeah. I just hope that when we do find them….it won't be in wax form.\" ●○●◌●○● Vanessa's POV ●○●◌●○● Just before the knife came completely down on me, the man washed tackled to the ground by Dalton. Dalton and the man both began to roll on the ground, each wanting the upper hand. I quickly stood up and began calling Dalton, \"Dalton!\" He was now on top of the man struggling to keep him pinned down. \"Nessa! Go now! Get out of here!\" He screamed at me. I just stood there not sure what to do. I didn't want to leave him. \"No, Dalton. I'm not leaving! \"Just go! Hurry, I can't hold on much longer! Go!\" I looked at him with tears running down my face. He gave me a look, over his shoulder, telling me to listen to him and not argue. I stood there a few more seconds before nodding my head. I gave him one last look and then ran. I found my way out of the museum and ran down the street, still crying over my friend. I ran as fast as I could trying to reach the gas station were Nick said we would all meet up. I needed to get to him so that we could help Dalton. I was only a few blocks away when my breathing became harder. I stopped for a quick second before continuing. But when I stopped, I heard some noise coming from a nearby alley. I was freaking out at this point. What was going on in this town? I didn't want to go anywhere near the dark alley. Then I heard him…...Nick! \"He said he had a brother, right?\" I heard Nick ask someone. I made my way into the alley following his voice. \"Yeah.\" \"Vincent.\" \" At the house of wax, he did all the sculptures. He' gotta be the one that does the wax.\" Carly! He found Carly. Oh thank God. I picked up my pace, passing some old rusty cars. I turned a corner and there they were. Nick was looking around a corner at something while Carly stood behind him. I stepped out of the corner and ran to them. \"Nick!\" I yelled with my voice coming out a little hoarse. As soon as they heard me, they both turned. Nick looked relieved and ran to me. I met him halfway and jumped into his arms, crying once again. He hugged me tightly to him, which I did as well like he could just be ripped away from me. \"Oh God, Oh God. You're okay. You're okay, I got you.\" He mumbled into my hair. \"Where's Dalton?\" He asked looking down at me. \"He told me to run. He's up at the museum.\" I said. He looked at me then looked back at Carly who was standing looking at us quietly. His gaze then landed on some sort of store that sold hunting things. I let go of Nick and ran to my best friend. We hugged each other tightly. She quickly began telling me what happened to her and Wade, then what happened to her and Nick at the station with the Bo guy. I decided to not say anything about Wade, I didn't want her to go through that right now. We stopped talking when Nick spoke, \"We gotta do something.\" \"What if he's around here somewhere?\" Nick then began to make his way to the hunting store holding some tool in his hand, with me and Carly following behind. \"Nick, what are you doing? You gotta be careful.\" I said to him. \"I am being careful.\" Was all he said and continued towards the store. We made it to the store right before Nick through whatever was in his hand at the glass window. Thankfully, Carly managed to stop him before he succeed with his action. \"No, no , no. It'll make too much noise.\" I said to him. \"Why do you have to be so damn stubborn. He will find us.\" Carly added. \"Yeah, chances are he will anyway. At least with this, he might not wanna find us.\" Nick said before throwing what was on his hand at the window. The glass shattered into hundreds of pieces. Both Carly and I covered ourselves from the flying glass. Nick then made his way to the display and grabbed the crossbow from the wax figure holding it. \"That's about right.\" He said inspecting it. Out of nowhere a gunshot was heard and the glass door next to us was shattered. Nick jumped down grabbing my hand and telling us to run. \"Go, Carly, Nessa! Run!\" He pulled me with him and all three of us ran to the nearest building we found, which was cinema, with the Bo guy after us. ** A/N: Another Chapter! And Yay Vanessa didn't die! Any who, hope you liked it. Also, would you guys like a double update today?** ZahraAhmedxx: Hope you liked the chapter and thank you for loving it :)[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight We all ran into the cinema as the Bo guy kept firing at us. As we entered the cinema I almost tripped, but luckily Nick was there to catch me. He put his free arm around my waist pulling me along. Carly opened two double doors and we followed behind her into one of the showing rooms that was completely dark. We went in some more and stopped in the middle of the aisle when the lights turned on and an old black and white movie, with a singing lady, began to play. I held on to Nick's hand as all three of us looked around the room. There were wax people seated randomly as if they were watching the movie. This place just kept getting creepier and creepier. I didn't even know what to think of this town anymore. I never expected any of this to happen. This town looked a little abandon, but I never thought it was full of dead people covered in wax. I guess not everything it what it looks like. We heard Bo coming so Nick told us to blend in and hide. Carly and I went to go sit at some seats next to the wax people, while Nick went off to another direction to hide as well. The door to the showing room opened and I knew it was Bo. He was quiet and I could only assume he was looking for us. \"I know you're in here.\" He said proving my suspicion. Through the corner of my eye I could barely tell he was counting the wax people. I began to get scared. I grabbed onto Carly's hand, who was sitting next to me, and she gave me a reassuring squeeze. He passed by us walking to the front of the room, pointing his gone randomly along the way. He got to the front of the room and looked up at all the seats carefully. He then looked to where Carly and I were sitting. When he squinted his eyes, I knew he found us and we were screwed. He pointed the gun at as and I squeezed Carly\"s hand tighter as she gasped a little. \"Nick!\" Both of us yelled and ducked down just as Bo fired his gun and shot the wax person that was right behind Carly. Nick then shot the crossbow at Bo hitting him on the arm making him fall to the ground. I stood up getting ready to run and grabbed Carly, who looked back to see the wax person that was behind her. When we got to the top of the aisle Nick was there waiting for us. He once again grabbed my hand and pulled me with him, just as Bo fired, again. We made it back to the main area of the cinema. \"Go hide behind the counter. I got this.\" He ordered both Carly and I. We did what he said and I went behind the counter and ducked down, as Carly went behind the booth for the tickets. I peeked out a little to see what was happening when the showing room door opened. Bo walked out with his gun and gave a little creepy smirk when he saw Nick. Nick had the crossbow up and aiming at him. He shot it and it hit Bo in his upper left scapula. With that he was down. I stood up and walked around the counter to stand by Nick, Carly followed. Nick had the crossbow ready to swing it if necessary. I was behind him holding on to his jacket as we slowly creeped closer to Bo. Nick bend down to drop the crossbow and grab the gun. He checked it but there was nothing. \"Empty shells. Check him for amo.\" He said to Carly, who slowly went to an unconscious Bo. she bend down and began to search him, but not before giving him a couple of kicks to make sure. Nick grabbed me around the waist and pulled me towards him and I hugged his waist too as we looked at Carly. \"There's nothing in his pockets.\" She stood up and grabbed the gun from Nick and threw it over the counter. \"Give me this.\" \"Nick let's get out of here.\" Carly told him. Nick was just staring at the wax guy in the ticket booth. \"Babe, come on. We gotta get out of here.\" I said, taking a hold of his hand and leading him out of the cinema. We began to walk around town trying to figure out what to do next. \"Is there anyone left alive in this town?\" He asked as we made our way to where some old rusted cars and junk were at. \"What about this Vincent guy?\" Carly asked. \"Who knows if there even is a Vincent guy. We gotta get out of this place.\" Nick said as he walked ahead of us and ran his hand over his head. \"Look, what about Wade and Dalton? We can't just leave them behind.\" Shit! I completely forgot about them. What kind of person am I? I hope Dalton's alright. Maybe he got away and is waiting for us at the road by the truck like we all planned earlier...Yeah, that's it. He's waiting for us and he's completely fine. But then there's Wade, I can't tell Carly. At least not now. We stopped next to some old-rusted thing and looked at the house that Bo lived in. \"You said your cell phone's in the truck?\" Nick asked Carly as he put his arm above my head on the thing me and Carly were both leaning on. \"Yeah.\" she answered. \"Alright, this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go up to the truck and get your phone, and see if I can get help.\" He then looked between both of us. \"You two go back to the road. Paige and Blake…\" \"What?! No way, Nick! I'm not leaving you.\" I said to him. He's freaking crazy if he thinks I would do such a thing. \"I'm not leaving either, Nick. I completely agree with, Nessa.\" Carly backed me up. \"Why do guys have to be so…\"He said, getting frustrated. \"...damn stubborn.\" He took a while just looking between Carly and I again before he spoke again, \"Okay. We stick together, nothings gonna happen to us.\" Carly quickly agreed and left both me and Nick. I stared at him for a moment before quietly asking, \"Promise me nothing's gonna happen to us, Nick.\" He grabbed me and hugged me tightly and I returned the gesture. \"I promise, Nessa. Nothing will happen to any of you. I'll die before it does. Even then, I'll try my best to protect you.\" I looked up at him and gave him a kiss. We broke away when Carly told us to hurry up. We walked up the road carefully looking around at our surroundings. We made it to the truck that was half off the hill thing. \"It's under the front seat.\" \"Nice parking job.\" Nick said, trying to lighten up the mood. I smiled a little. Carly opened the drivers door and began searching for her phone. I stood next to Nick and looked around to see if anyone was coming. After a bit Carly stood up and said it wasn't in the truck. We stood quietly for a while before we all looked at the house. \"Wade and Dalton.\" Nick said looking at the house. Wait, maybe Nick had a point. Maybe, Dalton went into the house instead of going back to the truck. \"Wade went in there and never came out.\" Carly said. \"Alright. We'll go in quick, one pass. We can't find them, we have to get the hell out of here.\" Nick told Carly. Carly just nodded her head and replied with a 'yeah'. Nick then turned to me, \"Okay, babe? Just a quick pass.\" \"Yeah. Okay, let's do it.\" I said grabbing his hand, because to be completely honest, just thinking about going in there is scaring the shit out of me. \"Let's try the back.\" Nick said. We then began to make our way to the back of the house that crazy-psychotic-wax obsessing Bo lived in. **A/N:So next chapter will most likely be the last chapter of this movie fanfiction :( BUT , there will be an epilogue, therefore, I will be making it a double update.**[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine We silently and carefully made our way to the back door. Nick was in the front leading the way, while Carly was in the middle and I was at the very end. We reached the house and ducked as we passed a window. \"Stay close?\" Nick whispered. Yeah, like I'm really planning on going somewhere without them. We all stopped in front of the back door. I stepped closer to Nick as Carly went of to a corner to grab something. When she turned I saw that she was holding a wooden baseball bat. Both Nick and I looked at her questionably, which she just shrugged off. Must be for protection, smart. Nick, then took a deep breath and carefully opened the door. He stepped in and signaled us to wait, while he looked inside. After that, he popped his head back out and nodded for us to follow him. It was dark inside, just visible enough to see what was at arms length. Carly stepped in after me and took a quick look before reaching out for the house phone. She picked it up and held it against her ear, after a couple of seconds she put it back down. There must be out of service or something. I followed Nick who walked more into the house. We walked into what looked to be the living room. There was light in here which made it a lot easier to see. I looked around the house as Nick went towards the stairs. I saw a pool table in the area which I assumed was meant for the dining table, but I could be completely wrong. \"Dalton? Wade?\" I heard Nick whisper yell. I turn to see him looking up the staircase. I go stand next to him and look up, too. Then we hear Carly calling us. \"Nick, Vanessa, there's guns.\" We followed her voice to where she was and saw her standing in front of glass-cage thing with guns in it. We walk up to her and Nick quickly makes his way to the guns. At first he tries to pull it open, but it was locked. He grabs the bat from Carly and decided to use that to get it open instead. \"No! Wait…..here wrap it with this. It'll make less noise.\" I stop him and then hand him a green cloth. He wraps the end of the bat with the cloth and then his the glass, successfully breaking it. I move forward trying to get it open, but I can't. Carly goes to check it out from a different angle only to say it was bolted to the wall. This was just great! The only weapons that will guarantee us protection are freaking bolted to the wall and are caged in. We need to find something to open it with. \"Look, there has to be a key somewhere around here. We should look for it, or for something that will help us open it.\" I say to them \"Yeah, you're right.\" Nick says We all split up and look around the room. I look in drawers and under things, but can't find anything at all. I turn to see if there others found anything. I see Carly standing by an open drawer with a picture in one hand, while holding the bat in the other. Nick is also looking around and it looks like he's having the same luck as us. Suddenly, we hear a door slam open. Shit, Bo! I don't even know where to run and I'm just standing there like a complete idiot, when Nick grabs my hand and pulls me into the kitchen. We hide behind the refrigerator as Nick puts me behind him and listen to what going on. I take a look from behind Nick to see Carly huddled up in a corner hugging the bat to her chest. Nick nods his head to the side signaling her something. He pushes be back with an arm over my stomach to make sure I stay back, as we here Bo getting closer. He sounds like he's in some serious pain. Serves him good for the shit he's put us through. I see another room off to the side and signal Nick to it. He nods his head and pulls me into the other room just as Bo was getting closer to the kitchen. We make our way to where there is another set of stairs that don't actually lead up to the second floor. We go up them and look around. We step into the room when we here what seem to be a car and a door slam close. \"Go in there. I'll be back I need to get Carly.\" Nick says motioning to the dark room. \"Okay.\" I give him a quick kiss before he leaves. I turn to the badly lit dark room and let my vision adjust. Once it has adjusted, I could see that it looks like some operating room. I walk some more until I see light coming from a door on the ground. I bend down and open it just enough to see that there's some underground passage. We could use this to maybe get out of here. Right? I turn my head to see Carly and Nick come into the room. I point to the door and Nick smiles and nods at me. He come closer and opens it completely. He's half way down when Carly says something horrible, \"I saw Paige and Blake's bodies…..they're dead.\" I stood there shocked from hearing that. Oh my God! Paige could have been pregnant! What is wrong with these people? \"We've got to go. Now\" Nick says and makes his way down. I look at Carly and put a hand on her shoulder before heading down myself. I held on to Nick's hand as I took in my surroundings. The walls were plaques of wood and the ground was just dirt, with some lights above illuminating our way. There were spiderweb's everywhere and dust. There was also this really loud noise, that we, for some reason, were following. The closer we got, the louder it grew. Then, I finally saw that it it was a generator that was making the noise. As we passed right by it we all covered our ears from the loud noise. Right after passing the generator, there was no light at all. It was complete darkness. \"Damn. I can't see anything.\" Nick said. \"There's gotta be a light here somewhere.\" He then let go of my hand and headed to where there were different switches. He began to randomly mess with them trying to get one to work and turn the lights on. \"Come on, let's try those over there.\" I told Carly pointing at some other switches on the opposite wall. \"Yeah, okay.\" We were switching randomly until one of us got the right one. The lights came on and we continued to walk. We walked until we saw some room up a head. The room seemed to be covered in melting wax. What is up with these people and wax?! \"What is this place?\" I asked no one in particular, yet Carly answered. \"I don't know.\" Nick walked up to a table in the middle of the room. I saw him pick something up, so walked over to see what it was. When I got there, I saw that it was Dalton's red cap. \"Dalton.\" I was still looking at the cap in Nick's hand when I saw him walk away. I looked up to see him walking to a figure sitting down completely covered in wax. Looking closely at it I knew who it was….Dalton. I was completely shocked. I thought he had gotten away safely. I looked to see Nick trying to get Dalton free, Carly stood a few feet from them. I stayed in the same spot from before. Then suddenly, Dalton's head came off. Carly and Nick hugged each other in a comforting way. Maybe, if I wouldn't have left, he would still be alive. This is all my fault, I should have tried to help him and not run. God! Why do I have to be such a bad person?! I need to tell Carly about Wade. I just to need too. \"Carly?\" I quietly whispered with tears in my eyes as I looked at her. She slowly looked up from Nick's chest.\" Yeah?\" \" I-I well…..Wade...Gosh I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.\" I said stuttering and letting the tears fall. Both Nick and her looked at me questionably before it dawned on them what I was trying to say. \"How?\" She managed to croak out. \"W-when Dalton a-and I were at the museum. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but I just didn't know how a-and I couldn't find it in me to make y-you hurt.\" Carly just cried even more into Nick's chest. I couldn't bare looking at my best friend hurt so much, so I turned my head so that I wouldn't see it. We all turned to the way we came, when we heard some one coming. As the person got closer I could see it was the guy that attacked Dalton and I at the museum. \"That's vincent!\" Carly yell. I felt someone grab my arm. I looked to see it was Nick, who let go of Carly and came to, to pull me behind him with Carly. The guy pulled out two knives and came at us. Nick pushed one of the tables at him and then went for the attack. The managed to cut Nick on the back. Me and Carly then both went at him next, but he pushed us down. Nick once again began to struggle with the Vincent guy. I heard a noise and saw that some pot had catched fire. After Nick knocked Vincent to the ground he came to us. \"Come on, babe. Carly, let's go. Move it. Move it.\" He helped me up. Carly and I kept running as Nick poured the wax that was on the pot, on to the ground. \"Nick! Let's get out of here, hurry!\" I yelled to him. We went up some stairs with walls that had wax faces on them. We ended up at the wax house. We continued to run down the dining room, when we saw Wade. \"No. Oh my god, Wade.\" Carly said. Nick pulled her out of the room Wade was in. Nick suddenly stopped causing me to bump into Carly who was right behind him. There in front of us stood Bo. \"You sick fuck!\" Nick yelled before tackling him to the ground. Bo ended up flipping Nick over him, he Nick landed on his back. They continued to fight as Carly and I stood behind. Carly was holding the bat up ready to use, which she did. Bo through Nick into a coffee table breaking it. Carly ran up to Bo with the bat in her hands and attacked Bo. Bo then punched Carly in the face sending her back. \"Carly!\" I ran up to her to see that she was passed out. I looked up to see Nick get back up and start fighting Bo, again. I then looked around and saw the ground to melt. Great the house is made out of wax too! I began to tend on Carly trying to wake her up. \"Carly, come on. Wake up. Wake up.\" I turned when I heard Nick scream in pain and saw him on the ground with a knife stabbed into his leg. \"Nick!\" I grabbed the bat, that was now on the floor, and ran to Bo. I got there and gave by best swing hitting him right on the face. I kept doing it and doing it until a hand stopped me. Carly took the bat from me making me stop. I looked down to see Bo covered in blood and dead. I just killed someone… \"Carly, Vanessa, behind you!\" We turned to see vincent coming. We ran to where Nick was sitting on the ground holding his injured leg. \"Nick, babe. Come on, get up please.\" I begged trying to help him up along with Carly. We stopped when Vincent let out some weird scream and began to make his way to us. \"Run! Go, Carly, Vanessa, run!\" \"This way.\" Carly said heading up the staircase. I followed behind her hearing Nick trying to get Vincent's attention. I looked back at a struggling Nick and Vincent who was coming up the stairs after us. \"Hey, Vincent. Hey!...I swear to god if you hurt any of them…...Vincent!\" Carly and I both continued to make our way up the staircase. We got to the top of the stairs and we stopped. We looked to see Vincent getting closer to us. I pushed Carly forward and up another set of stairs that led to the third floor. We headed to a door that was right in front of us and pushed it open. The inside seem to be the master bedroom, with a window off to the side and a wax bed at the center of the room. I continued to look around and saw a crib with two babies in it. One of the babies was connected to the others head. Carly was leaning on the now closed door and looked at me scared. I just stared back. \"We need to get that crib and push it up against the door….Come on, help me.\" She said pointing at the crib. \"Yeah, hurry. He's coming.\" We went to one side of the crib and began pushing. Due to the fact that the house was slowly, but surely, melting, it was a lot more difficult to push it. At last, we managed to get it against the door. Just when we did, Vincent cut straight through the door and down between the wax babies separating them. I picked up Carly from the ground, since she got startled from Vincent that she fell. She then grabbed the bat from the bed, where she threw it at when we pushed the crib, and held it up. Vincent had half his body through the door now. We were trapped with nowhere to go. I was us and him now. He threw the crib to the side of the room and looked at us with his wax face melting from the heat. My heart was hammering so fast, I literally thought it would burst out of my chest. I was slightly standing behind Carly, when out of nowhere she started talking to him. \"No. Listen to me. Listen to me….\" She held her hand up trying to get him to stop. \"What are you doing, Carly? He's not here to talk. He's here to kill.\" I said to her. She just completely ignored me and continued. \"I heard you talking. You don't need to do this. You didn't need to listen to your brother. I saw Bo's scars. And the high chairs.\" What the hell is she talking about. Vincent ignored her and came at us. Carly jumped over the bed screaming 'No' and I was right behind her. As I was in the middle of the bed, I felt pain shoot through my left back shoulder blade. I screamed from the pain and tripped making me fall of the bed landing on my hands and knees next to Carly. Good thing too since Vincent had taken another swipe that would have really done some damage. \"Vanessa!\" Carly yelled and came over to help me stand. Vincent was still on the other side of the bed looking at us. Carly had the bat in one hand and held my arm with the other. I was trying to hold and put pressure on the cut, but it was a little hard to reach. It really hurt too. Carly continued her talk with Vincent, \"You're not a freak! He was!...You didn't need to do this. Please…..You're an artist. Bo was lying to you….\" Where's Nick? I hope he's okay, this place is burning/melting down! I came back when Carly pleaded with him not to kill us. She grabbed my hand and ran out the room screaming. Vincent was coming after us, but Nick tackled him to the bed. \"Motherfucker!\" He yelled Carly and I hit the wall on our way out. She recovered and stood there watching Nick and Vincent fight on the bed. I on the other hand, slid down the wall because of the pain. Gosh! I so freaking weak! \"Carly! Vanessa!\" Nick yelled for us. Carly made her way into the room, but not before slipping first. \"I'm here.\" She said. I heard Nick scream in pain. No! Nick! I slowly stood up and went back into the room. When I got there I saw Carly with the knife, that was in Nick's leg, in her hands. Now I knew why he screamed. Both Carly and I screamed when Vincent tried to attack her. Luckily, Nick was able to stop him. \"Carly, do it! Do it now!\" Nick ordered Carly then stabbed Vincent. She screamed at she kept pushing the knife in deeper. I stood there looking at the scene before me, shocked and relieved a little. Shocked, because now Carly and I had both killed someone. Relieved, because now they couldn't hurt anyone else. \"Vanessa? Babe, move.\" I did what he said and moved to stand closer to Carly. Nick then Kicked Vincent of himself making him land right where I stood seconds before. When Vincent hit the floor it collapsed under him. We soon followed, with Carly and I screaming on our way down. Good thing we landed on the second floor and not the first, which was burning and half of it was melted away. I stood up and went over to Nick to help him up. \"Come on, babe. Get up. We gotta get out of here!...Carly help!\" We both helped Nick stand and we all started to back up as the floor melted. Nick grabbed me around the waist and pulled me close as we hit the wall behind us. We were trapped! First, we have to deal with some psycho killer. Now, a melting house. Great! Note the sarcasm. \"How do we get out of here?!\" Nick asked We continued to back away. Carly then turned to the wall and told us dig. Nick let go of me and all three of us began to dig into the wax wall. \"Dig!\" \"Faster! Faster!\" We made a decent size whole and climbed into it. First it was Carly then me and Nick last. We stopped when we saw how high off the ground we were. And we were also in-between 'W' and the 'X', since we knocked down the 'A'. \"We need to wait until we get closer to the ground before we get out.\" I said When we were closer to the ground, we crawled out. We got as far away from the house and stood back to see it burn down. Nick then put his arm around me, but I flinched and hissed from the pain. \"Are you hurt? What happened?\" He asked concern and looked at my injury. \"Vincent managed to get her when we were up in the room.\" Carly informed him. After convincing Nick that I was fine and that he shouldn't worry about me when he was in worse shape, we walked away. The sun had come up a while ago and now the entire town was surrounded by cops and firemen. Carly, Nick, and I were sitting in the back of an ambulance getting our injuries checked out. Carly was getting her finger wrapped up and I was getting my cut covered up with the EMT guy telling me I needed stitches. We were all going to go to the hospital after all this. When the guy finished with me, I stood up and sat next to Nick who put his arm around my waist. I leaned my head against his shoulder and looked around at all the people coming in and out of the buildings. \"Hey, that's my friends camera!... Hey, that's my friends camera!\" Nick yelled at the sheriffs who was walking away with Dalton's camera. \"Sorry, son. That's evidence.\" Another sheriffs said approaching us. \"Are you guys okay?\" We didn't answer, we just gave him the 'Are-you-serious-right-now?' look. \"Well, don't worry we'll get you to the hospital.\" \"How can no one have known about all of this?\" Carly asked. \"Truth is, this town is hard as hell to get to. It's been abandon ten years, ever since the sugar mill shut down. Hell, it ain't even on the map anymore….\" He continued to talk about the rest of their discoveries and how, if it weren't for the smoke they would have never known. I just leaned into Nick more and put my head on his chest, drowning out the rest of their conversation. We spent a little more time there, in which Nick had gone somewhere during that time, before we left. The ambulance was now heading out of crazy town and taking us to the hospital. Nick was between Carly and I and had his arms around us. Nick pulled his arm from around Carly and took something out of his jacket. He pulled out Dalton's camera. \"You took it?\" Carly asked her twin. \"Just felt wrong leaving it behind.\" He mumbled \"Maybe there's some good memories in it.\" I added. They looked at me and smiled. \"You guys okay?\" Carly then asked. Nick, once again, hugged us to him saying, \"We're okay.\" With that we drove away. Away from the town that completely changed our lives. It took things and the people we cared about from us. But it also brought us together and made us stronger. We might never be able to forget what happened this weekend, but what I do know is that, we just have to Keep Holding On. **A/N: Next chapter is the epilogue!**[Chapter 10] ❉ Epilogue ❉ It's been two months since the events of that tragic weekend happened. Carly, Nick and I became the big talk of many news channels. They called us 'The Lucky Three of Ambrose',...wish I could say the same about our friends, though. It eventually died down and we didn't have to worry about the media. Those events brought us all close, more than we could have ever imagined. Nick and Carly's relationship was once again how it was before, no more fighting or ignoring each other. Now, they share this bond that no one could break, well, I guess all three of us do. Nick and his parents began to talk again, it may not be great, but it's still something. As for me, well I'm good. Still going through life, enjoying every second of it. Because if I learned something from this experience, it was that we may never know when tragedy might hit. Nick and I are still together. We recently bought a house in Northern-Florida because we needed more space and our little apartment wouldn't do. A week after the events, I found out I was pregnant, about a month along. I guess Paige might not have been the only one. I still get sad thinking about her. What if she really was pregnant? Anyways, I didn't really know I was, due to the facts that I didn't really start getting the symptoms until 2 weeks later. Nick was happy when I told him the news. He also began crying, when I asked why he was crying, he just hugged me and told me that he couldn't think of what he would have done if he had lost me, especially now that I was pregnant. We both cried that day. A couple of days after the incident, we held the funerals for Wade, Dalton, Paige, and Blake. It was hard seeing their families so heart broken and crying. None the less, it was a very beautiful ceremony in memory of our friends. I just wish we would have all gone out of it alive and not have to go through that. After that, Carly eventually ended taking the internship offer and moved to New York. I'm really glad she took the offer, it has helped her take her mind of things, which is really good. She stays in contact with us as much as she could, or we just go visit. You're probably wondering what we ended up doing with Dalton's camera, huh? Well, we haven't done anything with it. Nick keeps it safely hidden. We haven't found the courage to look at it. It's still too soon to look at any of the videos of the day we lost our friends. Plus, Nick feels that our little messing around and what not that Dalton recorded, might not be the only thing in the camera. That makes it a lot more difficult to consider looking at. Maybe one day we will see it, but until that day comes, it will be kept as it is. Now what is left to do, is keep moving on with our lives and keep the good memories of our friends with us. Because through those memories, is how we move on and live. Not just for us, but for them as well. THE END ✵✵A/N: I just want to say…... THANK YOU!

Time to go.\" Then he felt a wet nose on his forehead. The orange cat yawned and blinked. His vision was a bit blurry for a second but once his eyes adjusted to the light, he could see the scruffy face of the dog that had tricked him into stealing food not too long ago… But he did save him from that Doberman last night. And that was probably the reason he slept snuggled up to the mutt. \"Wha…\" the kitten said, still sleepy. \"Mornin' kiddo! Quit grillin' at me and hurry up, we gotta go.\" The dog said while stretching. \"Where?\" the kid asked. \"The city, kid. We got a lot of work to do.\" replied the mutt as he was heading for the stairs. \"Dodger?\" asked the cat. \"What?\" Dodger looked back at him, brow raised. \"I'm hungry.\" Right on cue the kitten's stomach let out a small growl. The dog felt a pang of guilt because he never really gave the kid his share. Come to think of it, he actually never got to eat his own. \"Aight, wait a sec.\" A moment later he dropped a hot dog in the small cat's paws. \"Eat up, catto, 'cause it's the last one.\" prompted the canine. The kitten devoured the sausage like a starving predator. He did look like a tiger cub because of his tiger like coloration. Dodger thought the same as he watched the kitten eat and smiled to himself, shaking his head. The feline noticed that. \"Whuth?\" he managed, his words barely comprehensible because of his stuffed mouth. \"Anybody ever told ya ya look like a tiger cub, kid?\" Dodger asked. \"Wusth ah thigah? the kitten tried once again to speak with a full mouth. \"Ya don't know what a tiger is?\" the dog was surpised. \"Wehl.\" the orange cat gulped \"No, I don't. What is it?\" Dodger was about to answer but then another voice joined in on their conversation. \"It's a type of wild cat at least fifty times your size.\" answered Rita. \"Also, we have to hurry, Fagin is waiting on us.\" she added, looking at Dodger. \"Yeah, right. Come on kid, let's show ya how we live… or die, if we don't find the cash.\" said Dodger with a smile, contrasting his last statement. Even though Fagin's scooter was small and barely functional all the dogs – and cat – fit surprisingly well. The amount of smoke that thing produced, coupled with the loud choking sound and the animals stuffed in the makeshift basket at the back, was quite the sight. Certainly something you'd remember. The cat was holding onto Dodger's paw for dear life. \"Relax, kid! You ain't gonna fall, I got ya.\" said the canine. To be honest, Dodger was growing fond of the cat. He reminded him of himself. He reminded him of himself a lot, actually. Maybe that's why he let the kid sleep snuggled up to him. But the dog would never admit it. \"Okay, Dodge\" replied the kitten, trying his best to look like Fagin's driving didn't bother him. \"Hey, ya callin' me Dodge already? Be careful kid, I might start callin' ya-\" and it just dawned on him that he didn't know the cat's name. \"Heh, you know, actually I need ya name first.\" The cat looked troubled. \"Um… I don't… have a name.\" he replied ashamed, as though it was his fault. Dodger's expression changed from confused to sad. But then he got an idea. \"Well… what about-\" \"Alright, gang, this is the big one! We have three days to do or die.\" Fagin interrupted them, while tooting the scooter's horn. „Dodger, you keep an eye on the little kid…\" And he was planning on doing just that. The kitten had endured too much and was still way too young to understand but he seemed to be coping with it pretty well. He had a smile on his face. \"…I just want you to keep one thing in mind-\", Fagin was bad at driving but he was considerably worse at stopping. He almost crashed into an alleyway. \"Dead men do not buy dog food! So big smiles and get out there and fetch!\" with the man's command all of the dogs leapt out of the basket and he drove away in smoke. \"Alright, if Mr. Sykes don't see some cold hard cash soon we are Doberman chow. Come on!\" Dodger said to the gang. He made sure the kid was still with them of course. He was going to come up with a name for the little cat. He just needed to take care of this first.[Chapter 2] \"Hello? What have we here?\", Dodger had noticed a Cadillac limo passing by him and the gang. \"All right! A chauffeur shuffle!\", exclaimed Tito eagerly. \"Listen up! Einstein, gimmie a fender bender at two lights\", Dodger instructed and the dopey Great Dane nodded. \"Tito, you're in charge of electronics.\", this made the Chihuahua shake with excitement. \"Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis…\" \"I know. My public awaits.\", and last but not least, the Bulldog answered dramatically not missing a beat. \"Hey, but what about me? What do I do?\", asked the kitten ready to help any way he can. Dodger almost forgot about him. He mentally slapped himself. \"You help Tito.\", the dog added finally. \"All right! Come on, gato, eh, Uncle Tito will show you how it's done.\", Tito put a paw around the cat's little shoulder. \"Ready? Go!\", commanded Dodger and everybody split. He and Rita mingled with some people on the street and waited. \"You feel alright about letting Tito watch over the kid?\", Rita asked. \"Yeah, I ain't worried.\", he lied, obviously. The dog was in fact very worried, given that Tito was about the same size as the cat which meant that if something were to go wrong, the Chihuahua would most likely have no chance of helping the kitten. \"Really? 'Cause you sure do look worried to me.\", Rita replied smugly. Dodger was mildly caught off guard. \"If ya say so.\" He tried to act indifferent while observing Einstein to make sure he's doing thing he told him to. \"The kid seems to have a crush on you.\" This made Dodger's eyes pop out. He looked both horrified and embarrassed. \"No! Not like that, you dumb dog! The kinda crush kids have on someone they see as a role model.\", she corrected herself, or rather clarified her former comment \"You're like a superhero to him. It's kinda cute.\" Dodger didn't know what to say. This made him feel great and terrible at the same time. \"Heh, what can I say, I'm one of kind.\", he said, trying to sound cocky but Rita knew him too well. Just as he finished his sentence, Einstein charged at the limo and hit it good. Both Rita and Dodger winced. \"Do you think he'll be all right?\", Rita was first to ask. \"Yeah, yeah. I'm sure he'll be fine. He's a large boy.\", he didn't necessarily sound convincing. \"Look at Frankie!\", said Rita amused. \"Yeah, he's really milkin' it, isn't he…\", Dodger laughed. \"Dodge, can I ask you something?\" \"Sure.\" Uh-Oh. ' Dodge' , meant the topic was sensitive and the time wasn't right. \"Are you trying to help the kid because he's like you?\" Dodger looked troubled. \"I-\", the mutt began but was interrupted by a growl. Out of nowhere the car started and both dogs thought that was their que but something flew out of the right window and the crowd noticed them. \"Let's get outta here!\", called Dodger. The gang hid in a corner full of cardboard boxes and other junk. \"Where's the kid?\", Rita asked Dodger worried. \" Cough-cough He musta been in the car, man!\", the toasted Chihuahua answered. Okay, now Dodger was very worried. \"You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito! \" , he put an extra emphasis on his name to let him know how pissed he was. \" Cough, well, it's hard to watch anything when you're getting barbequed, man!\", Tito had a point there. \"What are we gonna do, Dodge?\", Rita asked her friend. He jumped out of a box and said \"Tito, come with me! The rest of you, go back to Fagin.\", and then ran off with Tito. \"You really screwed up this time.\", Dodger told him while they were chasing the limo. \"Give me a break, man, it wasn't my fault, man!\", Tito defended himself. \"It clearly was, though! I can't trust you with anything!\", Dodger raised his tone. \"Dodger, man, calm down, I'm sorry.\", and then Dodger realized he was actually yelling at his friend. Probably because he was running and gasping but that wasn't the case. \"There!\", he pointed at the limo that parked near a large house. Dodger tried to go in but the door closed right in his face. \"Crap!\", he exclaimed. \"Man, check it out! How many people live here?\", Tito was clearly impressed with the size of the house but that was a given since he was, well, tiny. \"Let's get back to the gang, we need help!\" And with that the two dogs ran back to Fagin.[Chapter 3] The plan to save the kid went off without a hitch. The gang managed to sneak into the house. There they found a female poodle that was a bit full of herself – and Tito totally fell for her – but at least she led them to the kitten. So they put him in a bag and brought him home. When they arrived on the ship and were sure it was safe, they let the kid out. \"Hey, wait. What's going on, you guys?\", asked the kitten upon being released from the bag. He was probably quite scared. \"Just the rescue of the century!\", Tito chimed in, \"Shoulda seen how Frankie handled that butler.\" \"I was rather good, wasn't I?\", Francied tooted his own horn. \"And how about Tito and Miss Six-time National champion?\", said Dodger mocking the poodle. \"Hey, hey, but, wait. I don't understand you guys.\", the small feline was clearly distressed and confused. \"Hey, you okay kid?\", Rita asked him because she noticed it. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\", at that moment Tito grabbed him and planted a huge kiss on his forehead. \"Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito\" But the kid backed off. \"I was happy there! What did you guys take me away?\" You could cut the tension in the room with a knife. Dodger was taken aback by the comment. \"We recued you, kitty. We… We brought you home.\" Einstein was the first to break the silence, clearly confused. \"But, well, I have another home now. And someone who loves me.\", the cat replied. \" Someone who loves you ?\", thought Dodger. \"What do you mean, kid? You're in the gang .\", he got up and approached the orange kitten. \"But, but…\", and the kid didn't know what to say. \"The gang means family .\", the dog was getting emotional because his voice clearly cracked when he uttered the last word. \"We risked a lot to get you outta there.\", he added. \"Look, I'm sorry… But all I ever wanted was… was like.\", the kitten was on the verge of crying. You wanted to have it all, didn't you? \"What, what, this place is not good enough for you anymore? Don't wanna mix with the riffraff?\", asked Dodger. Although these were rhetorical questions. He was just making a point. \"No, no! I like you. I mean, I like… I like every… every one of you, but… There was a little girl… I just wanna go back.\", he finished letting a single tear drop. \"We never shoulda took him, Dodger.\", Rita whispered in his ear. I never shoulda brought him here in the first place… \"Dodger, please.\", the kitten sniffled. Alright then! \"You wanna leave? Fine ! There's the door.\", the dog was getting a bit unstable which was not like him at all. \"But he just got here.\", Einstein tried to reason with the mutt. \"Go on! No one's stoppin' ya.\", Dodger said, letting know that he didn't care. But why was he getting so worked up over it then? \"Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up.\", Tito tried to calm him down. \" You lighten up!\", he spit in the Chihuahua's face. \"If he doesn't like it, let up him go.\", and with that he sat in Fagin's chair with his back turned to all of them. He couldn't let them see he started crying. The small cat was looking at him the whole time until he slowly turned around and started climbing the steps. But at that moment Fagin came back.[Chapter 4] Fagin saw that the cat was trying to climb the stairs and gently picked him up. He was mumbling again because he obviously had no idea how to find so much money. He was surely done for… As the man was stroking the kitten to try and calm down he felt something on his neck. \"What's this?\", Fagin asked as he was looking at it. It was a tag with a name and address – OLIVER 1125 5 th Avenue \"So that's where you've been.\", the man said surprised, \"Looks like you're doing alright for yourself, Oliver .\" Oliver? They even named him? Dodger had wanted to name the kid. He even had a nice name picked for him. But it didn't matter anymore. He was done with… Oliver. \"Your owner probably spends more money on catnip than we do on food in a month.\", Fagin had a point, \"He's probably worried sick about ya. All alone in that big house, with only his money to comfort him. Only his millions and millions of dollars and-\" That's when the man had an idea. \"He-he-he. That's it! We're saved!\", Fagin said as he leapt out of the chair and started running around the place not paying attention that he almost stepped on his dogs. \"What a plan, yes! P-paper! Paper!\", he grabbed a random piece of paper from the bin and a green crayon as he pulled out a broken ironing board and used it as a desk. \"Dear Mr. rich-. Nah!\", Fagin scratched that, \"Mr. very rich, ha-ha-ha.\" As he was writing this later he was sliding down because the ironing board broke down completely. He thought that keeping Oliver hostage and asking for ransom money could save him. Once Fagin was done with that he took Dodger and Oliver with him to meet with Sykes. He probably brought the dog for protection even though he was too small to defend his master against those huge Dobermans. The strange thing is the man put Oliver in his pocket. He would've suffocated if it weren't for the holes in the coat. The kitten tried to talk to Dodger while they were walking towards the shark and begged the dog to help him but he acted indifferent. „Relax, Oliver . He's just gonna talk to Sykes.\", the dog's tone was dripping with sarcasm and sardonic overtones. The kid wasn't stupid. He picked up on it and that made him sad. \"Dodge, why do you hate me?\", Oliver clearly had no idea what he did wrong. He just wanted to be happy. His question made Dodger think. He didn't hate the kid - he was jealous and hurt. \"I don't hate ya. You made yourself crystal clear. Ya don't want to be around us, 'cause ya prefer the company of shallow rich kids who begged mommy and daddy to buy them a kitty just 'cause they really want one!\", the dog said that low and emotionless on the outside but on the inside he felt like growling. \"Jenny's not like that!\", Oliver tried to defend his friend, \"She helped me, fed me and treated me well. She's got nobody. Her parents are never home. I'm all she's got. Ow!\" Fagin patted his pocket to make sure the cat wasn't trying to escape. \"And what about the Champ, kid? She's got that b-\", Dodger almost let it slip, \"That poodle. She just likes to collect animals like all the other rich kids. That's how it starts, she's treating you well now but once she's tired of you, she'll get another pet.\" \"How do you know that? Because Fagin has five dogs?\", Oliver countered the mutt's statement looking at the man. \"That's different. He's poor, kid. He appreciates the little things in life like family . Not like that girl Penny's parents.\", Dodger corrected. \"Her name is Jenny and you don't know her or her parents. They're just very busy.\", Oliver was getting pretty defensive. \"Jenny, Penny, same dif. Rich kid names. Her parents don't care for her, they've got money, that's all they care about. She's probably gonna grow up to be the same only more depressed.\", Dodger concluded. \"You're very mean!\", Oliver didn't like Dodger's attitude. \"You're very naïve!\", the mutt countered. \"Why are you doing this? Do you know what I've been through?\", Oliver asked a bit emotional. \"I was left alone on the street. Every single one of my siblings was picked by someone but I wasn't. I spent the night hiding from a pack of hungry dogs. Then you found me and… and tricked me into stealing food that you stole from me. I hated you for it but… you were nice to me… And now you're mean again! You're not being fair.\", Oliver wasn't angry. He was just hurt by Dodger's words. \"Listen, kid. You're not the only one who's had rough times. Don't be a prima donna.\", The dog replied. \"What do you know?\", the cat was fed up with Dodger. \"A lot more than you. I've had the experience.\", the dog said. \"I'm starting to doubt it. The only experience you have is being a jerk.\" \"Watch the tone, cat! I said I don't eat cats but I haven't had anything in two days so I'm willing to reconsider\", Dodger warned him. \"I believe you…\" The canine sighed. \"Look, kid. Let's just agree that we're very different. You're not like me. I thought that maybe ya had it in ya, but now I see that you're just a cat. Ya like the comfort of the warm bed by the fire - I like the discomfort of my freedom. Ya weren't picked by a human. I wasn't let in the box.\" Oliver was actually listening to the dog through the pocket. \"But now we need money to pay this shark or else we'll be sleeping with the sharks. You'll be with your Jenny soon and you'll never have to see me again, don't worry.\" And with that, Dodger said no more. Probably because the three of them reached their destination. ","Summary":" \"Hey, kid.\" he heard a familiar voice say. \"Kid, wake up. Time to go.\" Then he felt a wet nose "},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Children of the Empire City","Author":"AlleyHound","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13095187","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A light snowfall heralded a new winter's afternoon in New York City. Fagin sat on the cold ground in an alley behind a convenience store, surrounded by dogs. His appearance -as always- was scruffy, but he now wore a uniform polo shirt for his recently acquired job. It paid a pittance, and the hours were few, but it meant he wouldn't go hungry. On his lunch break, he took the time to check in with his canine pals. The pressure off, Dodger led the gang with boundless energy, enjoying the most comfortable winter season he'd yet known. Though a part of him missed being able to be at his human friend's side at any time of the day, he knew the change had done wonders for Fagin's health and state of mind. Dodger made sure the dogs were no burden, keeping themselves fed and bringing home anything useful they found in the trash. Fagin plucked out a piece of ham from his sandwich and offered it to Einstein before pulling him into a clumsy hug. \"Stay warm, old buddy. Look after him, okay, Dodger?\" Dodger gave a single sharp bark and moved out with a confident swagger, looking back to signal the others to follow, his gaze lingering over Einstein. The Dane was not the young dog he'd once been; his old joints were stiff in the winter air and he was increasingly senile. The whole gang accommodated their senior citizens needs, but it was Dodger whom he'd known the longest, and Dodger who he'd look to. It was a responsibility the mutt took seriously, his carefree persona giving way to protective brother figure. \"Dodge!\" called Rita, trotting after him with graceful strides. \"You don't mind if I borrow Einy? And Tito, too.\" Tito pulled a face, suspicious. \"Sure,\" said Dodger, \"you up to somethin'?\" \"I want to get some clothes together to take to Willow and the kid, build up their den a bit,\" she replied. Willow was her sister, who lived not far from the barge with a young puppy who she'd taken as her own. Rita doted on the little one and was thrilled to be there as a devoted and caring aunt. Einstein beamed. \"I want to help! Can I go and see her with you?\" \"So, what? You takin' me to be kid's chew toy?\" Tito yapped, bouncing stiff-legged up to Rita. \"What you take me for? No, nothin' like that,\" she said. \"Eeeyaaaah!\" Tito screamed as he flew up through the air and straight back down again. With a bump, he landed on Rita's head. \"Yeah, you deserved that, crazy woman!\" Rita shook herself off and looked up to rows of washing that had been hung up to dry in the rare sunshine. \"Just grab onto something, Tito. Come on, please! For your niece.\" \"Hey, she ain't no niece of mine, she's your problem!\" Tito darted behind a heavy dumpster. Einstein reared up with his forepaws against the brick wall, his towering head leaning across to nip at a pair of thick stockings. He was just happy to help and had no qualms about Rita's extended family. \"But we don't want the puppy to get cold.\" Tito huffed, and Rita, unable to reach in to pull him out, reverted to her original plan of just getting the job done herself. She took a run-up, and pushing off the lid of the dumpster, propelled herself upwards. Her narrow but strong jaws closed around a woollen jumper, which lurched momentarily as the force of her body pulled the line downwards before coming away and dropping to the ground. \"Come on, Tito!\" Einstein said, the stockings now wrapped around his head. \"It's fun- really!\" Rita stuck her head in the gap to try Tito once more. \"No one can get the ones up high, but you. There's a blanket up there. I'd appreciate it… you know she's only little, the weather's gonna be tough on her.\" Tito turned around, his expression still somewhat grumpy. He didn't much like Willow, but he wouldn't wish ill on the pup. \"All right, woman, but you owe me big!\" He crawled out and braced himself. \"Got it,\" said Rita with a wag of her tail. She looked up to the blanket hanging high above them. \"You see it? That one.\" \"Hey, I can get that- no problem!\" Tito said, perking up. Not being forced into being used as a canine missile any longer, the challenge looked fun as Einstein had said. Rita picked the Chihuahua up by the scruff of the neck and hunkered down low before swinging him upwards and letting go. The tiny dog let out a shout, but this time his teeth connected with the tartan blanket and he hung on tight. The blanket lurched and bounced, but Tito's weight was not enough to pull it loose. Below, Rita and Einstein jumped around, barking encouragement. Tito tugged wildly, sending the washing line swinging all over the place. After a brief struggle, it came down, taking with it a blue onesie that had been pegged beside it. Appearing from the bundle, he howled in triumph. Rita grinned. \"See, that wasn't so bad, was it?\" She knew from experience that Tito would be difficult for the sake of being difficult, but when push came to shove he'd always lend a paw. \"That should do it; we should get outta here before we attract too much attention.\" Einstein stood patiently as Rita loaded up their haul onto his back and shoulders. He was tall enough that even the big blanket wouldn't be dragged across the cold, damp ground as they moved through the city. \"Just let me know if you need a little help with that, okay?\" she said. \"All right,\" the Dane replied cheerfully. As always, he was just happy to help. \"All right? Let's go.\" Not far from Fagin's barge, a gloomy abandoned warehouse had become a meeting place for street dogs from far and wide. A small few, including Rita's sister, Willow, had made the foreboding building their home. Willow was not a sociable sort and had a prickly demeanour with anyone outside of her inner circle, which was made predominantly up of her old friend, Flash, and her allies from a former gang. Now that she had her young pup, Jellybean, in tow, she felt obliged to make more of an effort, for the kid's sake. Jellybean was as outgoing as her adoptive mother wasn't, and Willow really didn't have much choice in the matter. Her relationship with Rita had been rocky; a roller coaster of deeply hurt feelings, shared trials, and ultimate acceptance and loyalty. The sisters were closer than they had been since they were tiny pups, but to the rest of the gang, Willow remained stand-offish. The evening cold was well and truly setting in when Rita led Einstein and Tito to the warehouse, which was now buzzing with dogs. In no time at all, Tito had moved smoothly into the gathering and began chatting up a pair of giggling Maltese girls. A little overwhelmed by the crowd, Einstein took Rita's tail in his mouth, ensuring he wouldn't become separated and confused. Rita's face lit up as her eyes fell on a wriggling white-furred figure that tumbled around the paws of the adults. Willow's adopted daughter, Jellybean was all paws and wrinkles, and there was no doubt that she was the small beginning of what would be a large, powerful dog. Her deeply lined face was split with a wide grin, one that broadened as her eyes met with her aunt's. \"Auntie Rita!\" the puppy howled, leading to Willow appearing out from the shadows. \"Hiya, honey, it's good to see you,\" Rita said, dropping her forepaws to invite the pup to her. It wouldn't have been needed- Jellybean was almost immediately rubbing her face lovingly against Rita's chest and snapping at her fluffy ears. With the puppy now head-butting a greeting to Einstein, Willow sat by Rita's side, eyeing the bundle of clothes that had fallen to the floor. \"You didn't have to bring us anything.\" \"I know how you feel about stealing,\" Rita said. \"I just saw that blanket and thought it would fit you two perfect. It's not charity, it's just a gift.\" Willow felt only genuine affection, without the tint of pity that she'd stubbornly been looking for. \"Well, thanks… I guess.\" She cocked her head. \"Lover-boy not with you?\" \"It's almost like Dodger's grown on you,\" said Rita with a knowing smile. \"No, I think he was gonna drop by the kid. I love him, he loves me, but I know I can't compete with that kitty.\" \"Well, at least you're under no illusions,\" Willow laughed. She'd had her ups and downs with Dodger but had come to look at him with the bemused affection of a reluctant in-law. Jellybean flopped down at Rita's paws and looked up at her, a silly grin still plastered over her face. \"I went out under the bridge today, went in the water,\" she said. \"Mom freaked 'cause it was so cold. But it's just water, right? A kid's gotta go explorin'.\" \"You,\" said Willow, \"need to do what you're told, little lady. Givin' Flash the slip like that, you know better than that. No way you're dyin' of the shivers on our watch.\" Rita pawed the pup's shoulder. \"Do what your mama says, all right? I'll take you out to have a splash around sometime, but you gotta wait 'til the season changes.\" \"Or I could come with you guys?\" Jellybean asked. \"I know you all go out in the busy parts, ridin' out on cars an' all that. I could do that too.\" Willow was quick to jump in. \"No way. No way in the world. I know I told you what happens when you get too close to humans.\" \"But nothin's ever happened to any of them-\" Caught uncomfortably between the pup and her overprotective mother, Rita tried to diffuse things in spite of her own views. \"Hon, your mama knows what's best for you, okay?\" \"But I wanna hang out with you. You're always busy swipin' off humans, but she won't let me do that.\" \"I'm sorry, J.B.,\" said Rita. \"You know, there's stuff I can show you round these parts. Einy would like that an' all. We can just take some time to take it easy an' have some fun. Okay with you, Wills?\" Willow shrugged. \"If you think you can handle this monkey, be my guest.\" \"She's no trouble. I know I haven't been around enough- you know how it is in winter.\" Rita glanced over to Einstein, who'd been pulled into a game of tug with the stockings, Jellybean growling as she hauled back. \"He's finding everythin' a little hard these days. It takes a lot of food to keep him goin'- we can't afford to let him get sick, not at his age.\" \"I get it,\" said Willow. \"You've got nothin' to explain. Let's just get comfortable back there and catch up properly, all right?\" Willow's den was upstairs, and right at the back of the echoey hideout. Away from the hubbub, they could relax, play and talk. Jellybean delightedly arranged her bed with the gifts Rita and Einstein had brought her. An hour or more rolled by, and the pup's sparkle gradually dulled, her need to sleep creeping up on her. Dodger came through the chewed hole in the door, Francis at his heels. \"Hiya ladies… Einstein,\" he said. Immediately, Jellybean's bleary eyes shot open. \"Hey, Uncle Dodger!\" She clumsily crawled forward on her belly, too tired to get up but eager to say hello. \"Hello, Dodger,\" said Willow wryly. \"I hope you know I only just got her to settle down.\" \"Chill out, Wills, we'll be outta your fur soon enough.\" Francis politely wagged his corkscrew tail, though he was apprehensive of Willow. He knew her to be bad-tempered, and unlikely to appreciate having her pup woken. \"Salutations, Willow! We apologise heartily for our intrusion- we arrive upon your door to reconvene with our comrades.\" Willow shrugged, irritated. \"Whatever, buddy, just don't take too long.\" Jellybean was now playing tug with Dodger's bandanna, still half-asleep but perking up by the second. \"All right. Well, we got food back at the barge, but probably not enough for all of us.\" Dodger watched Einstein's expression change rapidly from excitement to grave concern. He wrestled Jellybean off his necktie and looked to Rita, a glint in his eye. \"Thought you might want to come out with me, and we'd get a bite on our own.\" Before Rita could speak, Einstein had to get reassurance. \"So, I got food at home, right?\" he asked, earnestly. She gave a laugh. \"Go ahead, I'm up for a night out. Did you guys catch Tito?\" \"He was a little busy- looked like uh... what's her name?\" said Dodger, \"I'm sure I saw her round here before, but she ain't a regular. Anyhow, whoever she is, he'd made in impression.\" Francis shook his head in exaggerated exasperation. \"The night is young, and I fear we will see him little. I do not resent the peace and quiet, but one wonders how I will keep Einstein off Tito's share of dinner.\" Eager to fill their bellies, Einstein and Francis retreated from Willow's den, and Dodger patiently waited for Rita to settle her niece back in bed. Rita lovingly nibbled Jellybean's neck as she lay back down in the folds of her cosy new blanket. \"You get some sleep, all right, madam? And I will see you soon.\" She gave the pup a gentle kiss, and then nuzzled Willow goodbye. As she followed Dodger away, she couldn't stop herself from looking back at little Jellybean, who was flat out on her belly, and now had Willow settling down beside her. They were the picture of contentment, and it was a sight that lifted her. Out in the city under a moon shrouded with cloud, Dodger and Rita walked side by side, their senses wide awake as the challenge of scoring a meal took them into the hustle and bustle. The two were close friends. Trusted comrades since their puppyhoods, they'd grown into themselves together, and formed the backbone of Fagin's gang of dogs. The past year, and the effect young Oliver had on the stubbornly hard Dodger, had seen a change in their relationship, transforming their bond into a mateship- one of lovers. Both revelled in a life that was footloose and free of chains, and their union was relaxed and easy, with respect for the need for freedom on both sides. When push came to shove, however, they loved one another fiercely, and in moments like this, alone together in the concrete jungle, they were set alight. The air was cold, and getting colder, which pushed the pair to focus in and seize something hot to warm their bellies. A skilled and experienced team, it was not long before they were chowing down on jerk chicken in the gardens surrounding City Hall. There was enough cover that any human presence was of no significance in their minds, just background noise in their world. An amorous smile on her face, Rita slowly leaned forward and licked the last spots of sauce from Dodger's muzzle. The touch of her whiskers invited a kiss, and he let the yearning take him. The pair sank beneath the cover of brittle winter leaves and settled in for a while. Coming slowly down from the high her mate had left her in, Rita nuzzled her face in against Dodger's shoulder, appreciating him with each breath he took. Warm from their intimate embrace, she felt close to him, enough to delve into an area they'd skimmed around for so long. \"Baby,\" murmured, her voice gaining strength, \"do you ever think about what it might be like if we made a bigger family together. Like… with pups. Yours and mine.\" \"I know you have,\" Dodger replied, deflecting. He edged even closer to Rita. Of course, he'd thought about it, but that didn't mean he was sure what his feelings were. \"I see you with J.B., you just look happy, in a different way to anything I've known in you before.\" He paused, feeling her slight tension. She'd been holding onto this for a while, he knew it, and he wanted nothing more than to be with her on this. But he couldn't commit… not yet… there were just too many doubts. Dodger's life was one built on freedom, and fatherhood would be a tie that would either make him or break him. Was he the footloose rogue he portrayed to the world, or the responsible leader pups would need him to be? Could he be both? \"I have thought about it,\" he said finally, \"A lot, actually. You'd be a good mom.\" \"You'd be a good dad.\" Dodger blanched. There was the kicker; he wasn't so sure about that. \"Dodge, you would,\" Rita urged, feeling her partner's doubts. \"I understand that it might scare you, but you're so much more than you give yourself credit for. If you don't believe me, ask Oliver.\" Turning over so he could look Rita in the face, Dodger appreciated her faith in him. \"I can't lie, a big part of me wants to have that with you. It could be the best thing that ever happened to us, but…\" \"But it's huge. I get it.\" Dodger sighed, wishing he could just say it, just give her confirmation that he wanted to take that step. \"Yeah, it's huge. An' you know what my own mom was like; she felt nothin' for me. What if I'm like that? No kid deserves to have that put on 'em.\" \"If you ask me, that says it all. You're not your mother, and you never have been. Don't worry about it anyhow- I'm not putting pressure on you at all. If it's not what you want, I'm already happy with my life.\" For a little while, Dodger said nothing, lost in thought. If he was honest with himself, really honest, he did want to be a father. He'd felt it deep within from that first night Oliver curled up beside him. \"I wouldn't a' even thought about it, but since the kid…\" he said, \"I guess he changed somethin' in me.\" Rita yawned. \"I don't think so. You've always thought yourself a lot harder than you really are,\" she said. \"Am I meant to thank you for that?\" Rita just shook herself. \"We should get back, that wind's cold.\" She got to her feet and shook herself once more. The chill was worse for leaving Dodger's side, but the sooner she faced the cold night, the sooner she'd be tucked up in bed. They walked home, close enough that their sides brushed together, neither saying a lot. Rita was quietly content. The conversation had been a long time coming, but it had been easy. The seed had been planted now, and what would be, would be. The stairs creaked under Dodger's paws as he led the way down into the barge. \"You're missing a good one, you two!\" called Fagin, looking up from a storybook. Francis and Einstein were listening in at his feet, and Tito sat atop his shoulder. Rita strolled by and greeted her human friend with a lick to the hand, wishing him a goodnight. She preferred to wind down in the comfort of her bed but could not retire without giving Fagin a bit of love first. She arranged her blankets and settled down, still riding a high from her evening with Dodger. While Fagin continued to read aloud, she zoned in and out, contemplating their last conversation before heading home. Parenthood, for the first time, felt like a plausible future for her… for them. Determined not to give it too much thought, not wanting to get ahead of herself, she focused back on Fagin and the story until Dodger walked by her. \"It's cold tonight,\" she said. \"Sleep with me?\" Dodger gave his tail a single wag and looked at her with a tired smile. \"Absotively, babe. What am I here for?\" It took just a few moments for them to arrange themselves; Dodger often shared Rita's bed when the cooler weather hit, and he knew how to tuck into the draped bed just so, letting his mate spoon his wire-furred form. Dodger closed his eyes, like Rita, only half-listening as Fagin's voice lulled their companions to sleep. \"Hey, Rit… 'bout your question earlier. I'm thinkin'… just, maybe.\"[Chapter 2] Tentative questionings and optimistic hopes for the future soon became something real, with Rita quietly coming into season as winter neared its end. Dodger and Rita sloped off together frequently, feeling close in their shared excitement. This in itself was not unusual, but Tito, Francis and Einstein watched the pair for any signs that they might be trying for a litter. Like all the times before, they denied it, but those knowing gazes shared were enough to raise suspicions. As the window closed, the nervous waiting began. It didn't take long for the whole gang to notice a subtle change to Rita's scent, a tell-tale sign that something had changed. Neither Dodger nor Rita said a thing, not wanting to get anyone's hopes up. Not knowing for certain was agonising, and after over a week of waiting for signs, Rita took herself to the old warehouse where her sister lived… along with several experienced mothers who would be able to give her the answer she'd been waiting for. At first sight of her elder sister, Willow trotted over with her young Jellybean in tow. Coming to contact with as many roaming street dogs as she did, who came to the warehouse for a safe place to whelp, Willow took no time at all to assess the situation. \"Woah!\" she exclaimed, stopping in her tracks as she came close, \"Dodger's been a busy boy, hasn't he?\" Rita wagged her tail slowly, heartened by how obvious the change in her must have been. She could only hope that Willow was as good at reading these signals as she thought she was. \"We've both been pretty busy,\" she said, a smile coming to her face. \"Now we're just waiting to see if it's paid off.\" \"If you're not growing some pups in there I'll eat my own tail. I'm going to be an aunt!\" Willow raised her head and gave an excited yip. \"I'll get a second opinion before you get too excited- don't want to get Bean's hopes up.\" JB looked on with great curiosity. She wasn't entirely sure what was going on, but it sure seemed exciting. If her mother was going to be an aunt, did that mean that Rita was to have pups of her own? JB was now desperate to find out exactly what was going on. \"Why are my hopes up?\" she demanded. \"What's going on, Mom? What's up, Auntie Rita?\" Willow just gave the pup a gentle cuff with her paw. \"We're going inside, that's what's happening,\" she said. \"Auntie Rita needs to speak to Athena for a minute.\" Athena was the oldest of the dogs that frequented the warehouse, with life experience that made her a wise leader and mentor. A prized breeder once upon a time, in the life she built for herself on the streets she gave her guidance and wisdom to the many struggling mothers-to-be who'd come to the warehouse for shelter. What she didn't know about the ins and outs of bringing pups into the world wasn't worth knowing. It was she who would give Rita a careful inspection and give the confirmation the hopeful mother had craved. \"Congratulations,\" said the old dog, her one good eye sparkling. This was news she delighted in giving. \"you're definitely with pup! It's only just the beginning, but you have pups coming.\" Rita carried her litter well, enabling her to continue to work the streets as though nothing had changed. It was only on the sixth week that she began to feel encumbered by the lives growing inside her. Still, she kept up- perhaps not with Dodger, but at least keeping the pace set by Tito, Francis and Einstein. Her belly swelled, and the visual signal drew attention from a doting Fagin, who was giddy with anticipation, and Rita's niece, Jellybean. At any given opportunity, the pup would rest her head on her aunt's middle, and fuss over her in an almost over-bearing manner. Content as she was in her condition, Rita was tolerant of the attention, even at the end of long and tiring days. Coming up to six months of age, JB was as tall as both Rita and Willow, and much heavier; her large paws made it clear that she hadn't finished growing either. The warehouse she called home had quietened with the coming of spring, but she was no longer the lone pup among the regulars. A month-old litter of four had caused her great interest, and only heightened her wild enthusiasm for her unborn cousins. The warehouse pups were cute and all, but Rita's would be family. JB's focus on the infants was rather a relief to Willow, who'd been dreading her social butterfly daughter's upcoming adolescence. If JB was more interested in helping with her baby cousins than chasing boys, she'd take it. As she did each evening, JB kept a look out, roaming the route she new Rita and the rest of Dodger's gang would take home. Her tail wagged slowly as she picked up the scent. Dodger strolled into sight first, a string of hot dogs around his neck. \"Hiya, kid!\" he said jauntily. \"Come to check on mom and co.?\" \"They're still not here?\" JB asked, impatient. 'Any day now' was tantalising, and the pups just weren't coming quick enough for her. \"I told ya. When they're here, you'll hear about it. I'll send an envoy, stat. All right?\" Rita approached. \"Trust me, J, you're not the only one on tenterhooks. I think this'll be my last day out. I've been pushin' it, but better I'm not out in the middle of the city when things start happenin'. I wish they'd just show up to schedule, but we've probably still got a wait.\" JB nuzzled her aunt's face and then her belly. \"I wish they were here now ,\" she said wistfully. \"Do you have enough food? I caught a rat before, but I left some in case you wanted it.\" Dodger pulled a face. \"Rat guts ain't food, J, this is food. You're livin' in the city with the richest pickin's around, and you're mama's got ya livin' off rodents. That's just sad, man.\" As JB pulled a face, Rita responded more appreciatively. \"I'm set, but thank you. Tango's weaning her babies right now, isn't she? Something extra for them to nibble on wouldn't go amiss I'd bet.\" \"Do you want to come and see them? Get some more tips? Mom will be happy to see you too.\" \"Hon,\" said Rita, \"I really just want to rest my paws in my own bed, right now. It's hard work hauling these extra passengers around. You can tell your mama I said hi, though.\" Somewhat dejected, JB took the rejection with grace nonetheless. \"Okay, if you're sure. And I don't eat rat guts, by the way- just the meaty bits.\" With the arrival of the rest of the gang, Dodger was no longer paying attention, but she had to get the last word. Rita wagged her tail and started off towards home once more. The others were happily talking amongst themselves, so she could take the opportunity to connect with her niece- for what she suspected would be the last time before the pups were born. \"Walk with me.\" JB waited until she was out of earshot of the rest of the gang before she spoke. \"You should come and stay with us. I can help you build a den- I'll find food too.\" \"Sweetie, you know I've got to be home to have the puppies. They're gonna be part of the gang, from the start,\" Rita said, blindsided. \"Fagin would be heartbroken if I took that from him.\" JB whined. \"But I'll love them just as much. Please; you don't understand! I want to help- I've been learning from Tango. If you're holed up in your stupid boat, I'll never see them. Mom won't let me go there 'cause of your human.\" To that, Rita did not know how to respond. It would be a hard-faced lie to say that it didn't hurt that Willow's hatred of humans would prevent her from welcoming the puppies to the world, but she wouldn't put that resentment onto the innocent JB. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, after a thoughtful pause. \"I want you to be in their lives; you are going to be an amazing big cousin. I'll do what I can to keep you involved, I promise. But they need to be home.\" \"It's not fair. I don't think I could come if Mom doesn't want me to. She wouldn't just be mad… she'd be crazy scared.\" Rita gave the pup a lick to the ear. \"I know. It's not her fault either; this is going to be hard for her too. We'll think of something, okay? Just trust me on this.\" In all honesty, she wasn't sure how to balance the needs of her unborn pups and her extended family, but she was determined to try. Just as Dodger needed Oliver to be a part of this development in their lives, Rita needed her sister and niece. With JB having trundled off towards her own home, the gang's witterings were a distraction from such awkward practicalities for the time being. Francis slowed, allowing Rita to catch up. He looked over her with slight concern. \"You are troubled?\" he asked. \"Tired,\" she said, shaking her head. \"And wondering how I'm gonna handle Bean and Willow. I hate that it's gonna be weeks before they'll see the pups after they're born. I just can't see a way around it.\" \"They are old enough to make their own decisions. You can only ensure the safety of your children; any perceived exclusion in Willow's part is of her own making.\" \"Yeah, but it's not the kid's fault.\" Francis frowned. \"Alas, the woes of the parent are inherited by the child. Soon enough, such challenges will be yours also. As I said, your focus must be with your brood. No one shall question your need to put them first- even if it means some must look on from afar.\" \"Maybe,\" said Rita thoughtfully. \"I guess I'll be too busy to worry too much for a while. You know, I think it's gonna be soon. If they're not here tomorrow, it'll be the day after. I've got no appetite at all, an' I've just been feelin' weird.\" Tito trotted over, his gait springy with poorly contained excitement. \"All right! Finally!\" As they came upon the barge, Dodger waited for Rita to catch up with him and gave her belly a gentle nudge. \"I already decided I'm stayin' home tomorrow. You guys don't mind bringin' back the goods without me?\" That Fagin at least had a couple of days of work each week was a great relief; Dodger and Rita were without a doubt the best providers of the gang and having their focus elsewhere for the foreseeable future would be putting a lot of pressure on Francis and Tito. Einstein, of course, would help, but he tired easily, and his senility often made him more of a hindrance. Dodger had confidence in his gang and hoped he'd be able to take the time he wanted to be with his litter in those early weeks. Fagin's little bit of income had other effects too. The barge was rather tidier than it had been when Oliver had stumbled into it all those months ago; the holes in the roof having been patched up with the help of a charitable Winston, the broken old television replaced, and a fold-out couch had replaced Fagin's barely comfortable recliner. Out of two wooden pallets, the he'd had built a covered whelping box; a den in which Rita could raise her puppies in the early days. A series of sheets draped over the top and down the sides gave the box a cosy feel, and the inner floor had been lined with newspapers, cushions and torn blankets. Rita had been acquainting herself with the space in the past few days, and it now felt like home. It was larger than the bed she was accustomed to, with room for Dodger to more easily lie beside her if he chose- usually they slept apart, but he'd taken pleasure in feeling a closer connection with her and the unborn pups. Dodger was determined to be an involved parent from the beginning, and that meant being a part of the space that would initially make up the puppies' entire world. Rita entered her den and, having rearranged the bedding a little, settled in for the evening. It was early, and the rest of the gang was still boisterous, but she was tired. Her body's aches and pains were taking their toll, and she was well and truly ready for this part of her motherhood experience to be over. She couldn't bring herself to do more than nibble at scraps… she just wanted to sleep, but still she was fidgety. Rita didn't know a lot about these things, but her instincts told her that the birth was imminent, and it made it difficult to relax. By the time Dodger lay down himself, Rita had long been asleep- tossing a little, but she didn't wake when he settled beside her. He was last to bed down, as usual. His eyelids drooped as he listened to the snores of Einstein and Francis. Dodger knew, as Rita did, that it would not be long before they shared the whelping box with the brood. It had crept upon him, and apprehension had set in. He'd felt the pups move, and fatherhood was now real to him. It was uncomfortable to be powerless, and he knew that there was little he could do to help Rita through the birth. What came after that would be even more daunting; a new kind of family, one that needed him to step up in a way he never had before. He rested his next to his mate's swollen middle, feeling a flicker of movement within, and fell asleep. It wasn't even an hour after Fagin bundled Einstein, Francis and Tito into his scooter the next morning that Rita felt the time come. She'd been restless since the early hours of the morning, arranging and re-arranging her whelping den. Painful twinges during the night had woken her several times, but suddenly it was far more than just discomfort. Rita panted hard, her claws gripping the wood floor through the cover of newspaper. She'd never felt anything like this, and it was frightening. Life on the streets made her hard; signs of weakness were seldom given, but even she found it hard not to cry out from the pain of it. She steeled herself; all she wanted was to see and tend to her puppies, and the wait was almost over. Looking straight ahead into Dodger's eyes, she strained, blocking out the searing pain in her lower abdomen and focusing on what she knew was coming. There was great pressure beneath her tail, and she saw Dodger's eyes widen. She turned her head and fell into a near trance, instinct taking her through the next seconds as she helped her firstborn take his first breath. The infant's squeak pierced her giddy haze, and she could hear Dodger beside her, spluttering with unashamed joy. \"We've got a little boy, Dodgie,\" Rita breathed, the continued pains she was feeling seemingly fading as she found herself engulfed in a wave of love for the tiny baby puppy. The pup was a dark red-ish brown, a prominent mask across his eyes. It was clear that he was strong and healthy; he'd crawled forward to nurse with little hesitation, drawn to his mother's side as if by a powerful magnet. Dodger grinned, \"Congratulations, you're a momma. He looks like a little bandit,\" he said, noting the dark fur on his face. \"Kinda fitting.\" Finding herself needing to start pushing again, Rita clenched her claws into the blanket she lay on. She closed her eyes in concentration, groaning loudly as her body strained. Once the worst was over for the time being, she looked back to the perfect, still wet baby by her side. \"I like that,\" she said breathlessly, \"Baby Bandit.\" A short while later, another healthy boy puppy was born, followed just a few minutes later by a little girl. Both had white fur with patches of colour- just like Dodger. \"Looks like I'm definitely the father, hey Rita?\" Dodger said with a smirk. He'd never had any doubt, but it was a unique thrill to already see little bits of him in the children he shared with his closest friend. Rita couldn't take her eyes off the tiny puppies that squirmed beside her and she licked them again and again long after they were clean. A warmth bubbled up inside her at every squeak they made, and she knew that there was nothing she would not do to protect them. It was hard to believe that she was looking at her very own children… hers and Dodger's. After a while, the pains started over again and Rita readied herself to bring her remaining pups into the world. Surely, she thought, there would not be many more- she hadn't been that big. She whined softly as she began pushing once again. \"You can do this Rita, you're almost there.\" Dodger whispered to her. He was full of admiration for his mate and was completely entranced by the three pups who lay between them. Finally, two more pups- a girl and a boy- joined their siblings. They were small, quite a bit smaller than the first three, but they were healthy, and squealed as their father licked them clean. Rita looked down to her side where her five newborns snuggled into her soft fur, drawn to the warmth and security of her body. All five of them had latched on, feeding, sealing the mother-child bond. It was an odd feeling, but Rita liked it, the sensation only further triggering the maternal instincts that were already near overwhelming her. She wondered how she would ever be able to tear her eyes away from those beautiful puppies, suddenly her life had been taken over and they were her everything. With tears in her eyes she licked her little ones all over again. Neither she nor Dodger had ever seen a newborn puppy before, and they were filled with wonder as they watched them. A sense of relief washed over Rita as she knew that the pups had made it safely into the world. She was a mother, and in Dodger's company she couldn't be more content. The broadest of smiles on her face, she looked up at her old friend and loved him. She didn't know the words to express her gratitude for his faith in her and himself, for his friendship, but as their eyes met she knew he understood. \"Check it out Dodger, I gotcha something to eat!\" Tito threw down a pitiful looking bit of partly eaten bread as he trotted across the barge floor. \"Our most sincere apologies, there is little to show for our day's expenditure.\" Francis said miserably. \"I got this though!\" Einstein proudly brandished an extremely scruffy teddy bear with a leg missing. The team piled into the barge, finally having finished work for the day and ready for some down time. Strange scents filled the space, leading to suspicions to be raised. Dodger emerged from the whelping box, a grin plastered across his face, causing a few questioning looks. \"That bear might be useful Einy; we've got something to show you as well.\" He could barely contain his excitement; he knew full well how much the puppies meant to the whole gang. \"You might have to wait, Rita's sleeping right now.\" \"Wha-? They're here?\" Tito shouted, jumping up expectantly, and soon he, Francis and Einstein were dancing for joy, and howling with mirth. \"Oh, Dodger, please can we see the babies- please?\" Einstein pleaded, almost falling over himself in anticipation. \"You'll see 'em soon enough, just keep it down, right?\" Dodger said, though he imagined it would be a pointless exercise to try and get everyone to kerb their enthusiasm. \"Mama Rita needs her rest.\" \"It's okay, I'm awake.\" Rita called, sticking her head out of the whelping box's curtains. \"You guys want to meet the new members of the family?\" She pulled open the curtain to share her tiny pups with the rest of the gang, who looked on with eyes wide. Everyone was unusually quiet as they watched the puppies sleeping, stunned by the sheer happiness that the precious new life had brought. \"So, what you got? Boys or girls?\" Tito piped up. \"Three boys, two girls,\" Rita said, \"The two big ones are boys, and the littlest one on the end there,\" she pointed the pups out with her muzzle. \"They don't have names or anything yet- except for the big brown guy. We've called him 'Bandit'.\" As they all oohed and aahed over the tiny pups, Fagin arrived home with dinner for his canine family. He was surprised to discover twice as many dogs as when he left in the morning. Rita proudly shared her puppies with him, allowing her master to hold her little ones. She had no doubt that Fagin would love her precious babies almost as much as she did, and his delight was obvious as he gently cradled the littlest, most fragile puppy in his hands. \"Nice job guys.\" Fagin laughed as he scratched Rita and Dodger's heads. \"The more the merrier, right?\"[Chapter 3] Dodger bounced upon the pavement, his usual cool façade dropped as he barked an announcement of his arrival outside the Foxworth house. There was no doubt in Oliver's mind what all the excitement was about, and he ran to the cat flap as fast as his legs could carry him. \"So,\" the cat said, his face bright, \"I guess you're here to tell me you're a dad now?\" \"Somethin' like that,\" said Dodger, who looked to Oliver as happy as he could possibly be. \"Five pups, all doin' well. Two are kinda small, but they seem all right.\" \"Oh, you guys must be so happy! How's Rita?\" \"She's good. Tired, but, yeah, pretty happy. Einy's stayin' home with her and the kids right now. I've gotta keep on top of things, but at least she's got some company.\" The arrangement, for Dodger to continue to lead the gang while old Einstein stayed behind, was not entirely to the mutt's liking. He dreaded the pups missing out on a connection with him from these early days- while he was happy for Einstein to have a bit more involvement, he needed to know that they'd see him as their father and no one else. They couldn't see or hear yet, so time away shouldn't be impactful, but it played upon Dodger's mind. Having experienced parental neglect as an infant, he wanted to make sure his sons and daughters never saw him that way. \"Can I see them?\" Oliver asked. Dodger gave himself a shake, flicking away his worries. \"Sure, but we've got some work to do first.\" Back at the barge, Rita quietly tended to her litter. She marvelled at their every squeak. In no time at all, she'd gotten into the swing of ensuring their needs were met, and she was confident and comfortable in this new role. The smallest puppy, the youngest boy, was quieter than the others, and seemed to find feeding hard work. Attentive as she was, Rita kept a close eye on the little one especially, but she really had little idea of how normal, healthy infant pups behaved. Einstein lay beside the whelping box, his large head resting on the edge. With each movement of the wriggling puppies, his heavy tail would thud against the floorboards in a contented wag. He loved those puppies so much that it filled up his whole being. \"Do they make you think of Dodger when he was a baby pup?\" asked Rita, seeing Einstein's gaze linger on the white boy- who looked most like his father. \"Yeah… it's good memories. Even Dodger's brother; he made us happy when he was here.\" \"Dodger's-?\" Rita did a double take. She knew that Dodger had two siblings, but he'd never even laid eyes on them. \"They were… they were born still, weren't they?\" The old dog shook his head. \"One was always dead- the girl, but there was another boy. He wasn't big and wriggly like Dodger. He died after a few days.\" Rita felt her stomach drop. Her Little Boy was different to the others too. Was he more vulnerable than she'd realised? Einstein was lost in thought, himself. \"I think that was when Dodger's mom went different,\" he said. \"She didn't want to be a mom at all, but when the small one died she stopped being the mom. She had finished with Dodger. But I loved them both.\" Quietly watching her pups sleep, Rita's heart ached for her mate. She hadn't known about the brother's death and the apparent effect on the mother, and she suspected that Dodger hadn't either. For the first time in her life, she felt sympathy for the mother who'd abandoned the young Dodger. She couldn't excuse the betrayal of a trusting son, but it was all too easy to imagine being utterly destroyed by the death of a pup. Just then, a call from up above announced the arrival of Dodger with his feline brother by his side. \"Anybody home?\" Oliver called. Rita looked up, rather relieved to be pulled away from her own thoughts. \"Come on down, kid!\" Oliver had never seen dogs so young and had little idea of what to expect. The puppies that lay beside Rita looked like fat furry sausages, with stubbly little legs, eyes tightly shut, and ears so small they were barely there. He looked up his friends and saw the prides in their faces. \"They're amazing! I can't believe how small they are.\" Dodger placed down a basket, which had a string of hot dogs inside. \"Ollie found this in his basement, not been touched in years. We thought it might be useful. And, of course, lunch is on me.\" \"Dodger said your sister wouldn't be able to come here to see the puppies. So maybe you can take them to her in this?\" Rita gave a wag of her tail. \"I appreciate that. Might see how they're going for a few more days, but that could be problem solved. You've met JB, haven't you, kid? She was almost as excited as we were.\" Oliver was given the largest of the pups, the spotted white boy, to hold in his paws. The puppy squirmed a little, but soon settled. For a long while, the small family relaxed together, sharing the hot dogs Dodger had brought back, and enjoying the opportunity to catch up. How long Oliver stayed for, Rita was not sure, for before long the magnitude of the past day and night had caught up with her and she'd drifted into a deep and contented sleep. The puppies grew fat and healthy, all except the one, the small male who had been born last. If he'd grown at all, it was so little that no one could see it. Fears for his health now plagued Rita's mind; her initial worries growing exponentially as it became increasingly clear that her Little Boy was fading. She barely left her whelping den, while Dodger tried in vain to convince her that it was in her head- he was just a baby, and he'd come around in his own good time. He didn't understand. Dodger was in his own bubble of happiness and in full show-off mode, proudly sharing his puppies with the rest of the gang and Oliver. Recalling Einstein's words… the death of Dodger's runt brother, and feeling the pup's growing inability to feed for more than a few seconds, Rita couldn't be reassured. She tended to the puppy lovingly, keeping the others away in a desperate attempt to help him to nurse, her efforts bringing about no obvious improvement. Dodger nipped at Rita's ear in light-hearted affection. \"You'll get cabin fever, babe. You even seen the sky today? Come on, let me take over for a while- go stretch your legs.\" Rita kept her eyes on her youngest, sure that his breathing appeared shallower than usual. Still, Dodger couldn't see it. \"Rit! You gotta snap outta this! I get that you're bein' protective, but this is too much!\" \"Will you get off my back if I go for a walk?\" she growled, immediately feeling guilty for taking her anxieties out on her partner. He might be naïve, but at least Dodger cared. She got to her feet and shook herself off. \"Just keep a close eye on Little Boy, all right? Somethin's up with him…\" \"He's small, that's all it is. Things will look better once you've been out in the fresh air,\" said Dodger, letting Rita's abrasive response roll off his back. \"I've got your baby.\" Dodger watched Rita reluctantly leave and made himself comfortable in the den. The strong smell of the puppies gave the place a feel of home, and the little ones immediately crawled to his side as he lay down beside them. Dodger now truly felt his new role as a father and was pleased to find himself taking it in his stride. Today, Einstein was riding around with Fagin in the trike, and for the time being, it was just the two parents together with their brood while the gang kept everything else afloat. As far as the new father was concerned, everything was easy. He could see that Little Boy was slower than the others and far, far smaller, but through his contented haze, it didn't truly register. Diligently, Dodger washed each puppy, going down the line. He smiled to himself as his older daughter squirmed happily to the loving touch. The others were sleeping soundly, having only just fed. And then Dodger came to the last puppy, the smallest. To his absolute horror, the pup was completely still. For a moment, his own breath caught in his throat. His son, his Little Boy, appeared lifeless, and Dodger could not push through the cold wave of panic to respond. Was it long minutes later, or just seconds, he couldn't tell, but the stricken father managed to pull through the haze of shock and terror to gather the pup close and begin to lick his little body. He could feel nothing there, just an empty ball of fur. Even as tears pricked his eyes, Dodger could not truly take it all in, and he kept on licking up and down the puppy's body. \"Come on, Little Boy, c'mon kid,\" he murmured between licks, his voice trembling. Time stood still, and he was unaware of the world around him as desperation grew. He couldn't believe it was happening, but there before him his tiny son lay prone. A moment away from breaking down, Dodger felt the smallest of movements from the form beneath his tongue… a shallow breath. He gasped with relief, his head thrown back, but then resumed his frantic licking, stirring Little Boy further. \"Dodge!\" Rita's voice drifted from the top of the stairs. \"Everyone okay?\" Dodger couldn't answer, his throat pained from emotion. Little Boy was breathing now, slow and shallow, but the shock of coming so close to losing his son was more than he could handle. Rita came down, her face a picture of concern as she felt the atmosphere in the barge. She strode over to the den. \"Dodge, what's happened?\" \"Little… Little Boy.\" Dodger's voice trembled. He didn't know the last time he'd let anyone see him like this, and he was painfully aware that Rita's own fear would re-double as she picked up on his. \"He was… we just about lost him.\" Her eyes wide with horror, Rita scrambled into the den and pulled her youngest son close. She tenderly looked him over, unable to speak. \"I managed to bring him back, baby, but I really thought… I thought he was already gone.\" Rita wept. \"He's breathing so weak,\" she whispered. \"I shouldn'ta' left. I knew he wasn't doin' so good. Oh, Dodge, I'm so sorry.\" Dodger nuzzled up to Rita and the pup, finding himself struggling to get his own breath back after the ordeal. \"You got nothin' to be sorry for, ya hear me? Nothin'.\" He took in the feel of her, of her and their small son, and the sensation grounded him. It was as if he'd woken from a nightmare, and they brought more comfort than he could say. He licked her muzzle. \"Rita, I want him to have a name.\" Rita closed her eyes as she focused on her pup's gently rising and falling chest. She guessed what Dodger was trying to say. If their Little Boy was to slip away, he deserved at least to be given the gift of a name, a reflection of their love for him. \"He's gonna make it,\" she said, quietly defiant. \"I know. That's why I wanna call him Chance. 'Cause he's got another one, an' he's gonna hang onto it like the fighter he is.\" The puppy gave a weak whine, and immediately Rita took the cue to place him at her side to feed. She blocked his clamouring siblings with her hind leg, allowing him to find his place to nurse without intrusion. He felt even weaker than he had before. \"Chance.\" It felt like it belonged to him. Rita leaned over her shoulder and rested her head down beside her feebly nursing pup. She couldn't leave him again, not for anything. Perhaps she was fooling herself that this tiny scrap of a pup might be able to cling to life, but he'd already fought that battle once and come through. Where there was a chance remaining, she'd believe in her Little Boy. The parents gave out a frantic call for help from Fagin the moment he trudged in the door, tugging at his sleeves and whining, pushing the sickly puppy into his hands. Looking Chance over, Fagin could tell that the pup had gotten weaker. His gaze lifted to meet Rita's eyes. \"What's wrong, girl? You think he's sick.\" Rita gave a deep and mournful whine, hoping to get the message across. Fagin was near-enough dog himself, and she trusted he'd understand that they needed his help. With a nod, and carefully cradling little Chance, Fagin stood up. He groaned and sighed, mulling over what to do. Somewhere in the barge's mess, he'd stashed an old milk bottle, one he'd used to assist Dodger's largely disinterested mother in feeding him those years ago. He could do the same here, but there was only so much he could do without taking the pup to see a vet. Whether the little money he'd scraped together from his new job would cover that sort of help, he didn't know- certainly he'd be left without a penny left for food. Seeing the worry in his canine friends' faces, he knew he'd somehow manage it. \"Okay, guys, I'll do what I can.\" Fagin held the tiny puppy close to his chest. \"You'll have to trust me on this, though. I need to take him to the vet for help.\" He held out his hand to Dodger. \"Can I take him?\" Dodger kept Fagin's gaze and placed his paw firmly in his gloved hand. He was scared, much more than he'd care to say, but he trusted his friend. Fagin had relied on him so many times, but now Dodger's future was quite literally in his hands. It was late when Fagin returned, little Chance wrapped snugly in a blanket and cradled in his arms. Rita leapt up, Dodger a short way behind her, and the rest of the gang looked on with faces lined with worry. Fagin knelt down and reached out to the parents, who nuzzled in to touch their son. \"He's gonna need a bit of help, but I won't let you guys down. I promise I'll get him through.\" Rita touched her nose to Chance's, feeling utter relief to have contact with him after those torturous hours apart. He'd stopped breathing once- how could she have known if he'd survive the trip to the vet? She closed her eyes, blinking back tears. She appreciated Fagin's staunch support, she appreciated it more than she could say. It would take far more than that, though, to get her baby out of the woods. The nights were long. Twice in the week that came, Chance again came close to slipping away, and Rita was afraid to let him out of her sight for a minute. She barely talked to anyone, totally focused on making sure the puppies were feeding properly, and that Chance kept on fighting. For the first two nights, she didn't sleep a wink, but finally exhaustion got the better of her. Fagin had scooped her into his lap and bottle-fed Chance as she slept. He'd struggle, yawning through work the next day, but he was determined not to let his dogs down. A dark shadow had fallen upon the euphoric bubble that Dodger had lived in, clouding everything. He believed in Fagin, he believed in Rita, and he believed in Chance, but he was a leader, a father, and he had to step up too. Dodger tore himself away from Rita and the pups, working the gang harder than ever before to make sure everyone was well fed while Fagin's meagre income went into covering medicine and formula for Chance. It was torture. Images of a lifeless puppy flashed through his mind and the cold feeling in the pit of his stomach would return in an instant. It was only through sheer determination that he managed to banish the waking nightmares and focus on the task at hand. Dodger returned to the barge, carrying with him a torn half of a pizza. The rest of the gang had already returned home; Francis and Tito having accompanied an exhausted old Einstein who'd needed to rest. He dropped the pizza on the floor and quietly exchanged a glance with his companions. \"'Atta boy, Dodger,\" called Fagin from the floor beside the den, a tired smile on his face. Rita lay passed out in his lap, four of the five puppies snuggled in close. As always, Dodger's eyes searched for Chance. He found him resting on Fagin's arm, squeaking as he rooted the bottle. Dodger's ears pricked. This was change, this was his boy moving forward. Whatever medicine the vet had given was working wonders, but it was clear that the rallying of the whole gang around Chance had made all the difference. The pup was smaller than the others still, but he'd grown. Fagin chuckled. \"He's doing okay! Can you hear him? A load of attitude, right there.\" Dodger stretched out and lay beside his human friend, his head resting against Rita's. He gave her a tender lick. She'd been the mother he knew she'd be… so different to his own childhood experiences. He looked up at the wriggling puppy in Fagin's arms, a Chance he'd never seen before- strong and full of spunk. He knew for sure now, the kid was going to survive. JB was falling over herself; jumping, panting, whining… as Rita came into view, holding on to a basket that had to be filled with puppies, the older pup simply couldn't contain herself. She gave a sharp bark of excitement- she'd waited far too long for this moment. Dodger led the way forward, his self-confident grin showing his pride in his family, which had now come through the danger period and were going strong. He coolly cuffed JB's side, quietly amused by her enthusiasm. This meeting should have happened many days earlier, but no one had been expecting a fight for the life of one of the pups. Rita, tired but beaming, placed down the basket and allowed her near hysterical niece to look in. \"Here they are, J, your cousins.\" Trotting forward, Willow looked over her older sister with an expression of concern. \"You look wrecked!\" she gasped. Rita laughed darkly. \"Will, you have no idea. But the kids are all doing great now, that's all that matters.\" The sun was out and the ground warm, so Dodger took the puppies out from the basket one by one, letting them sprawl onto their fat bellies. The big girl had almost completely opened her eyes by now and she blinked in stunned amazement at the bright new world around her. The two large boys snuggled together- brown-furred Bandit ignoring his spotted brother's trying to crawl right on top of him. The little girl with fur the colour of toffee propelled herself forward, making a bee-line back to her mother, whom she knew to be the safest, softest place to be. Chance rolled onto his back, kicking his stubby legs into the air. He squeaked as he made eye contact with his mother, talking to her. Smitten, JB lowered her face into the pile of puppies and smothered them with licks, causing a cascade of disgruntled squeaks to ring out. \"Bean! Don't suffocate them!\" Willow gasped. JB sat back, a little sheepish, and gazed at the puppies adoringly. \"I love them,\" she said wholeheartedly. \"You say that now,\" said Dodger, \"give 'em a week or so and they'll be chewin' up your ears.\" JB couldn't imagine the puppies could do anything to turn her against them. What was a bit of ear-chewing between friends? With Dodger keeping watch, Rita could stretch out and relax, Willow by her side and the warm sun on her back. She'd been waiting for this quiet moment for months now, and it felt wonderful. One by one, she introduced the pups to her sister and niece. \"This little guy is Bandit,\" she said, carefully nudging the big brown puppy. \"He basically lives to sleep… guess it's a tough life being a baby.\" Next to Bandit, the spotted boy was trying to catch eye contact with JB and sticking out his tiny pink tongue. \"That little monster doesn't really have a name yet, but we've been calling him 'Rascal'. We're pretty sure he's gonna be the life of the party- he's only just opened his eyes and he's already tryin' to work his audience. Basically, a tiny Dodger.\" The spotted pup squealed as JB stuck out her tongue back. \"Just what we need,\" said Willow, jokingly- or at least, partly jokingly. \"another Dodger.\" She looked tenderly at the small female pup, who had nestled herself against Rita's chest. \"This little one is all you.\" \"She's a little angel… for now at least. I'm not expecting it to last forever! We've called her 'Dash', 'cause whenever she's going somewhere, she's going there fast.\" JB grinned at baby Dash, who was oblivious to all attention. Rita nibbled at the belly of the other white puppy, whose face screwed up in delight. \"Our other little lady is Lily, here,\" she said, proudly. \"Girl's just totally switched on- you can see her just watchin' everything around her.\" \"She's gonna be trouble,\" Dodger added, looking absolutely thrilled with the prospect of having a naughty kid to contend with. The smallest of all the puppies crawled up between JB's huge paws. \"And this is the sick one?\" she asked. Those words churned Rita's stomach. \"Not anymore,\" said she said. \"But, yes, that's our man Chance. Source of too many sleepless nights.\" She looked down at her small son, who was no longer frail and vulnerable, but a little pup clearly filled from paw to toe with courage. For so many days she'd barely let him out of her sight, and he now couldn't bear to be parted from her. Even now, exploring these new smells, new surroundings, new faces, he was constantly aware of where she was. As far as Rita was concerned, Chance being something of a mama's boy was barely a worry. She'd help him find his feet in the big wide world- after all, he'd fought hard to be a part of it. As she watched JB happily bounce baby Chance on her forepaws, she added, \"He's had about enough of being sick. He's gonna be just fine.\"[Chapter 4] Lily's stubby legs reached upwards, and she dragged herself onto the stair. Panting a little, she looked up to the door, which was slightly ajar… and freedom. She was five weeks old, and by her reckoning, it was high time she explored beyond the world beyond the barge. Her ears pricked as she heard the creaking of paws on the wooden floor. She froze, trying to avoid giving herself up. As a shadow fell over her, she knew the jig was up. \"Mornin', Lil,\" said Dodger, his voice hushed. \"Goin' somewhere?\" The pup scowled. \"You know… out. To explore.\" \"All on your own?\" Lily remained tense, defiant, knowing that her father was about the take her back down into the boat. \"What am I s'posed to do?\" she asked. \"We're not allowed to go out there and play.\" Dodger couldn't argue with that logic. Truth be told, he was itching to get his pups out of the barge and let them spread their wings. He and Rita had decided to wait another week until taking the kids further- after all, they were surrounded by water, and puppy clumsiness could easily lead to accidents. He sighed. Remembering feeling the exact same way when he was a kid, he didn't have the heart to take Lily back to bed. Dodger picked her up by her scruff and carried her the rest of the way out onto the deck. Set down, Lily looked up at her father suspiciously. \"Am I in trouble?\" \"Nah! What do you take me for?\" replied Dodger, nonchalant. \"I get ya. I figured we could work a deal. I'll take you out now, but no more solo exploration- fair? Thing is, you could fall in the water, an' we'd never know. Make sense?\" Lily nodded slowly, not quite sure whether she was admitting defeat or if she'd just won the jackpot. A broad grin coming to her face, her tail began to wag. \"Dad, you're the best!\" \"See, that's what I've been tellin' ya! Come on, kid.\" When the sun appeared over the horizon, Dodger quietly watched the day's colours return to the city, his small daughter slumped sound asleep across his paws. An adventurer she might be, but Lily was still a toddler and even she could only take so much. He'd shown her around a little bit, but mostly he'd let her run free, taking in a world that to her was brand new. He could feel her sense of wonder, and he knew he'd been right to give her those moments. It was thrilling to see her coming into herself- barely could he believe that just a few weeks ago she was a helpless furry bundle. Now, fatherhood really had begun, and Dodger was learning more about the puppies' emerging personalities with each passing day- seeing snippets of himself and Rita reflected in each of them. The sound of voices downstairs caused the pup to stir. \"Sounds like the others are awake,\" said Dodger, as Lily stretched out. Waking herself quickly, Lily was up on her feet and heading back down into the boat, her father at her heels. The barge was starting to come alive with activity. Rascal and Chance were already engaged in a snarling tussle over an old rag, egged on by their 'uncle' Tito. Francis watched lazily from the flat on the floor, not quite ready to concede defeat and welcome the new day. Einstein, as always, was most interested in giving Fagin his slobbery morning greeting, which was received with hugs and guffaws. Usually one to enjoy a lie-in, Rita did not have the option these days, with her rowdy brood rising with the sun. She was up and about, Bandit, lying at rest, eyes half-closed, on her neck and shoulders, not quite as awake as his siblings. \"I was wondering where you two had got to!\" Rita said, catching sight of her wayward little daughter. She'd assumed Dodger was keeping the pup safe but wasn't entirely pleased to have woken up that morning to find Lily gone. Dodger looked at her somewhat guiltily. In hindsight, he should have woken Rita to let her know that Lily would be under his eye. \"Yeah, sorry- should a' given you a heads up. I thought it would be better that any late-night adventures were supervised. We've agreed, no more sneaking out.\" He looked down to Lily, who had trotted over to nuzzle her mother's chest -probably, he thought, putting on her best 'cute' act to lessen whatever trouble she might be in. \"Right, Lil?\" Her eyes wide and her face the picture of innocence, Lily looked up to Rita's frowning face. \"I promise.\" Rita shook her head. \"What am I going to do with you, child?\" She lovingly nuzzled Lily's cheek and planted a soft kiss. Sliding down from his perch atop his mother, Bandit gave Lily a playful headbutt of a nuzzle and turned to greet Dodger with a wagging tail. \"H'llo Daddy,\" he said jovially. \"Hiya, kid.\" Dodger pulled the pup close with his paw, drawing him into a hug. Tito trotted over, his steps springy as always. \"What's the plan today, chief? Is it Uncle Tito time?\" \"I dunno, man,\" Dodger said, shaking his head. \"I reckon I'm gonna need you out today.\" \"Aw, man!\" Francis gave a tired smile. \"Perhaps, Tito, you could appreciate the gift of serenity.\" He impatiently kicked away Rascal, who'd been batting at his corkscrew tail. \"Peace and quiet is difficult to come by these days.\" Rita caught her exuberant son's eye. \"Cool it down just a little, okay?\" As Rascal took the hint and ran off to pin Chance, she looked back to Dodger. \"So just me staying home today?\" \"Yeah… I figured we take Einy with us this morning, an' then I should be able to take him back home early. Give me a bit more time with the rugrats an' still get stuff done.\" Einstein wagged his tail in sweeping motions, and Rita smiled too. \"That sounds good,\" she said, fluttering her eyelashes a little at Dodger's direction. \"I feel like I haven't seen enough of you.\" \"I'm sure I can find time later… take a break from daddy duty.\" \"You better,\" said Rita, giving him an affectionate nudge. In what seemed like no time at all, Fagin had gathered up his dogs and headed out into the summer morning. Of course, Lily and Chance had put up a valiant attempt to join the crew, but Rita had easily curtailed them. She settled in Fagin's couch- which was beginning to show the wear of five little sets of puppy teeth- and watched her children play. While the others tumbled together, shrieking and pulling at ears and tails, Dash held back, glancing up towards her mother for silent reassurance. \"You're okay, honey,\" Rita soothed. Her little girl was a timid soul, lacking the brimming confidence of her siblings. Chance broke away from the scuffle, initiating one-on-one play with his gentle sister. Dash screwed up her face in a laugh as his teeth tickled her belly. The two were still the smallest of the bunch, but Chance was no longer frail. His brown, patched coat was thick and shiny, and his eyes bright. It had been a fight for him to survive those early days, a fight for him to catch up with his brothers and sisters, and a fight for him now to be seen as something more than a runt. What he lacked in size, he made up for in attitude; his sparkling personality and clownish sense of humour meant he was so often the centre attention- there was no doubt that he was Dodger's son. Chance had always been close to Dash… she was non-threatening, shy. In those days when he'd been attached to Rita at the hip, she'd often been close at hand, timid as she was. Dash looked much like their mother, but she had a distinct scruffiness about her that Rita never had. Her coat was a hodge-podge; wiry, silky and wispy, and she peered at the world through her fluffy fringe of dark red-brown fur. More or less, she was Chance's back-up support. When play got too heavy, she'd always be there for a cuddle. In the thick of the action, Lily needed no such reassurance. From the very beginning, she'd been the most precocious, the one to lead every charge, the one to face everything new. Bandit and Rascal were bigger than her, but she could hold her own no problem. Full of herself, she ducked and dived, leaving an ungainly Bandit to stumble onto his belly. Lily was slight, her expression distinctly impish and her coat a silky collage of brown and white. She held herself was complete self-assuredness, mirroring what she saw in her father. Since she'd first managed to crawl out of the whelping box, Lily would take any opportunity for independence, but she hero-worshipped Dodger. Entranced in his marvellous tall tales, her imagination could run wild… dreaming of a world filled with danger and adventure. Lily's outmanoeuvring spurred Rascal on, his frustration growing. He had boundless energy, too much for him to harness. Tripping over his own paws, he scrambled to get a grip on his sister, finally sinking his needle-like teeth into her tail. \"Gotcha!\" Rascal cried. Lily pawed at his chest as she tried to get back on her feet. \"Get off, Razz!\" He just snorted with laughter, thoroughly enjoying the rough play. Along with Bandit, he was the largest of the puppies, even at this tender age beginning to look gangly. In a physical scrap, he knew to use his size to his advantage. Rascal's fur had grown long and scruffy, giving him a wild appearance that matched his rambunctious personality. His coat, like Lily's, was a patchwork set against white, but far rougher to touch. Before Rascal could subdue his sister, he was knocked sideways as Bandit re-entered the fray. The eldest pup, he moved in a loose, carefree manner- even in the midst of a playful scrap. Bandit turned a happy somersault over his shoulder as he rolled over his brother and bounced around the action with his tongue hanging out. His brown coat was short and soft, the dark mask across his face that had earned him has name had faded somewhat but still remained. Once more, he tripped over his own paws and landed in a heap. \"Take it easy, Ban!\" Rita called gently. The kid was clumsy, that was for sure. She hoped he'd develop a bit more control of his flopping limbs as he grew into himself. Bandit waddled over to the couch and looked up at her with a goofy grin. \"I'm okay, Mom.\" Seemingly out of nowhere a drop of rain came through a hole in the roof, landing on little Bandit's nose. Confused, he looked around. \"What was that?\" \"What was what?\" \"I felt something wet.\" Bandit looked upwards and another droplet fell onto his face, then another. \"Mom, what is it?\" Rita looked upwards, seeing the hole in the roof. \" Oh , Ban, that's just a bit of rain. It's where water comes from.\" Intrigued, Dash toddled to Bandit's side and looked up through the hole, feeling droplets on her face. \"It's nice,\" she said, a smile coming to her face. \"Come on!\" cried Lily, and she made a beeline for the stairs. If there was something new around, it was her job to investigate it. Rita was quick on her feet, easily moving ahead of the puppies. \"Wait a moment! You can go on deck, but not without me.\" She supervised the kids as they trundled up the stairs one by one- with Lily excitedly taking the lead. Up in the fresh air, the sun was still shining through a thin layer of clouds. The summer drizzle had left a rainbow across the sky. Entranced, Dash lay on her back and looked up into the sky, taking it all in. Around her, the others danced and played in the shower, tongues out to catch droplets of rain. The sky darkened and the rain grew heavier. Rita shook herself, but it achieved little. \"Okay, we'd better head back in. You get cold and wet, you'll be shivering all day.\" Bandit and Dash trotted obediently downstairs, happy to take shelter from what was quickly becoming a downpour. Lily dragged her feet, reluctant to be confined in the barge, however unpleasant the weather. \"Lil…\" Rita urged, sensing that her headstrong daughter was on the verge of rebellion. On this occasion though, Lily was obliging. Slipping and sliding on the wet decking, Rascal and Chance were squealing with laughter. With Lily down below, Rita could focus on herding the two boisterous boys- well aware that their shenanigans were wandering dangerously close to the edge of the boat and skidding all over the place. Hastily grabbing Rascal by the scruff, she knew that Chance would follow along behind. A fidgeting Rascal held in her jaws, Rita came downstairs to find Bandit had already crashed out on the floor, and Dash was turning circles in preparation for sleep. She let Rascal down and settled him with just a look. He was a zealous bundle of energy, but, for now at least, he responded well to the boundaries she set. Rita wasn't about to take it for granted, and enjoyed the ease of creating peace and calm while it lasted. Ready for an afternoon nap, she nudged the Rascal, Chance and Lily towards the den. Dash yawned widely. \"Come on, baby girl, let's settle you down somewhere comfortable,\" Rita crooned, seeing the pup's little head nodding with the threat of succumbing to sleep. With Dash dragging her feet wearily, Rita gathered Bandit up in her jaws and settled down with the brood in the den. Her own eyelids drooped as she watched one pup, then the next, drop off to a peaceful sleep. Rita woke some hours later to the sound of heavy pawsteps on the stairs. She got to her feet quickly but carefully, not wanting to wake the puppies. As Einstein and Dodger came into the room, she greeted them with a broad smile and a waving tail. \"Hey, guys,\" she said, cheerfully. \"Einy, you don't mind keeping an eye on the kids for us?\" Einstein beamed, but Dodger was a bit taken aback. This was his time to spend with his puppies, and he was loathe to lose out on that. He knew that Rita had been wanting to get him alone- easier said than done when there was work to do and puppies to play with. Sensing Dodger's hesitation, Rita nuzzled up to him flirtatiously. \"Don't worry, Dodgie-baby, I won't keep you from them too long. We've just got some things to talk out.\" As she came out into the fresh air, Rita couldn't keep herself from breaking into a bounding run, feeling the breeze against her fur. She danced around happily, looking to Dodger to join her. He smirked. \"Someone's stir-crazy, huh?\" She dropped onto her front and swayed from side to side. \"You have no idea. We've all gotta get out of there. They're so ready.\" Dodger lurched forward and snapped playfully at her ear. \"Come on, let's find somewhere we can talk.\" An energetic jaunt through the streets brought the pair to a narrow alley, where they would not be disturbed. Rita pulled Dodger close by his bandanna and licked his neck. He leaned into her and kissed her side. \"So,\" said Dodger, his voice a low whisper, \"we gotta change some things.\" \"Baby, I think we've gotta trust Fagin with this. He doesn't really want you working the streets all day- he wants you to be with your kids. We want you.\" She nuzzled up, gazing tenderly into his eyes. \"It's not like I've not been around,\" Dodger started, somewhat defensively. \"but Fagin saved Chance, we owe it to him to make sure he's okay.\" Rita smiled, a little too understanding. \"Fagin's got his job now, he doesn't need us how he used to. Dodge, I know you feel like you've got to prove you can look after everyone , but no one has ever doubted you. Take the load off a little- you know I'm perfectly capable of leading the gang if you take some time to be a stay at home dad.\" Dodger returned Rita's gaze with a thoughtful frown. \"I never doubted you being capable. I just never want to be a burden on Fagin… it's always been us lookin' after him, not the other way around.\" \"Hon, these things work both ways. He loves us, you idiot.\" He responded with a light nip to her muzzle. \"You're right… we gotta change things. If we're gonna get the kids outta the barge, we'll need more of us around in the day.

I only own Harlow. No matter how much i wish i owned nick... This is my first story so if you could tell me if it sucks or not that would be greatly appreciated. Chapter one: \"Okay, look here's one in Tribeca for three thousand.\" Paige pointed out to a hopeless looking Carly. \"That's still way too much. All the money I saved up won't even be enough to cover two months' rent. I'm going to have to work every minute I'm not in class until graduation.\" Carly put down the paper and rubbed her temples. \"Carly! Don't you dare think about not going!\" Paige said while looking at Carly. \"I'm not.\" She said \"Good. Because you know how proud we are of you.\" Paige said while kicking Harlow in the leg to nod along. Up until then she had been busy eating her French fries and texting her little brother. \"It's just an internship,\" Paige stopped her before she could finish, \"At Instyle magazine!\" Harlow nodded, \"Or you could just stay at the Waffle House as a waitress forever?\" Seeing the disgusted look at Carly's face Harls smirked knowing she'd proven her point. Scrunching her nose up at the thought, \"No, thanks.\" \"Yeah that's what I thought. Now hand me the paper beside you.\" Harls said pointing to the paper under Carly's elbow. The girls were so busy looking at the paper that they didn't notice Wade sit down next to Carly. \"Hey, babe.\" Dropping a kiss on Carly's forehead before smiling at Harls and Paige. \"Hi.\" \"Sorry, there were two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.\" Wade said turning to face Carly. \"There are no rednecks in New York.\" Paige said while looking back up from the paper to give Wade a look. \"No there isn't.\" Wade answered looking uncomfortable which made Carly glare at her as the atmosphere got extremely tense. Thankfully Paige broke it. \"Well, I'm going to go see what Blake's doing,\" as she got up fixing her shirt she took note of the car he was in, \"he seems to like that car more than me nowadays.\" With Paige gone, it was just the three of us sitting there in awkward silence. \"On that note I'm going to go find my guys.\" Smiling down at the two she set off to see what Nick and Dalton were up to. She stopped at the door to see him picking on a poor homeless man with Dalton right beside him with his video camera. \"Babe, leave him alone! \"Harls yelled walking over to Nick trying to pull him away. But Nick being the dick he is had to go and kick the cup out of his hands. Glaring at him she got 50 dollars out of her bag, giving it to the man, \"I'm sorry about him.\" Walking back towards the table with Nick and Dalton following she ignored him. As they set down Nick grabbed her waist pulling her close. \"I'm sorry.\" Nick whispered in her ear. \"No, you're not.\" Harls said but she still let him hold her close. Before he could say anything back Wade interrupted. \"So, what do you think guys? Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow huh?\" he nervously said trying to break some of the tension. \"Yeah,\" Nick mumbled. Harls elbowed him in the ribs trying to keep him from saying anything further. \"Dalton please don't film me.\" Carly covered her face in attempt to get Dalton to turn his camera off. Acting like nothing was going on Dalton spoke, \"What,\" laughing, \"I'm not filming now.\" \"The red light is on dumbass.\" Harls said, while kicking him under the table hoping he would just turn the damn thing off. \"Put the camera down,\" Nick said while pushing the camera down towards the table, \"She doesn't like having people in her face, she folds under pressure.\" Great here we go again. \"You got something to say to me?\" Carly yelled while her eyes turned into tiny little slits as she looked over at Nick. Matching Carly's actions Nick replied, \"No, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you?\" And that was Harlow's queue to get Nick away from here. Rolling her eyes, Harlow got up from the table taking Nick's hand in hers, \"Come on babe.\" Seeing Dalton with the camera sill in his hands just pissed Nick off even more, \"Dalton put down the fucking camera. God!\" When Nick and Harlow were out of ear shot Harlow pushed Nick up against a car, \"Why must you be such a prick?\" \"Because the guys a douche!\" Nick grabbed Harlow's hips to pull her closer, running his fingers against the exposed skin between her shirt and jeans. \"Can you please, please try to keep the peace?\" Seeing the expressionless look on Nick's face she knew it wasn't going to happen. \"Fine at least just during the car ride?\" Harlow asked while placing her hands on his chest and looking pleadingly into his eyes. \"We'll see.\" Knowing that was the best she was going to get, she smiled at him while leaning up to place her lips on his. \"Thank you.\" She said pulling back to hug him. \"… Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year…\" \"Man, it's going to be packed tomorrow.\" Speaking of things being packed only made Harlow's legs hurt even more. She was currently stuck in between Nick and Dalton in the very small backseat of Wade's car. Nick trying to the ride comfortable as possible put his arm around Harlow pulling her closer to him, giving more room for the guys in the back. \"Speaking of packed, my legs are killing me back here, man.\" Dalton complained groaning for what felt like the thousandth time since they got in the car. \"Don't worry man, it's not Wade's fault his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.\" While Harls thought that was kind of funny, she didn't want to hear the siblings go at it again, so instead of laughing, \"Nick shut the fuck up!\" She yelled while sending her elbow into his ribs. Rubbing his chest he looked down at Harls and shrugged. Laughing at Nicks comment Dalton went along to add his two sense, \"Psh Hot Wheels car? It's more like a shot wheels car isn't it Wade? What did you do, go to the barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut?\" While Carly turned around to glare at him Harlow kicked him. \"Shut up dude.\" Nick said while pulling Harls closer to him. \"So much for a nice little shortcut.\" Seeing the car turn toward a new direction, everyone's patients were getting a little thin. \"Oh, my god.\" \"Look at her. Look at her!\" \"You're caught on tape.\" Hearing the murmurs start up in the car, Harls turned to look at the car next to them only to fine Paige going to town on Blake. \"Look at his face!\" Getting annoyed with the talking Nick reached up and hit the horn, not even two seconds letter Paige called Carly. \"You are so busted!\" Carly said laughing into the phone. \"Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm.\" Paige said from the car holding up her lip balm to prove her innocence. \"She says she dropped her lip balm.\" Carly said relaying the message to the others in the car with her. \"Yeah, right.\" Harlow said rolling her dark blue eyes at the blonde. In a desperate need to change the subject Carly asked, \"So, what's up?\" Rolling the phone away from her mouth Paige looked over to Blake, \"It's getting late, what you want to do?\" Rolling his head to look at Paige, \"Keep going, we don't even have tickets.\" He said like it like that's the only option they had. Harlow leaned closer into Nick, not really caring about the conversation going on. \"Why don't we just camp out? We're close enough, right?\" Harlow looked over into Blake's car, hoping they would just come to a decision, she got her wish when he shook his head yes and soon they were pulling on to another dirt road. \"Hey, wax museum.\" Wade pointed out the sign as they drove by. Nick never the one to give up the opportunity to make fun of Wade chirped in, \"You like that kind of stuff Wade?\" Harlow looked up at Nick with a warning in her eyes. Shrugging Wade looked in the rearview mirror at Nick, \"Yeah I don't know. Sometimes.\" Feeling Nick's sharp intake of breath, Harls took it as her queue to cut in, \"I think a wax museum would be kind of cool. To see all the shit made out of wax, it'd take a lot of skill to make the stuff.\" Harls noticed the thankful look in Wade's eyes. Before another argument could break out, they pulled into a vacant lot and parked the car. Not waiting any longer the three were pushing on the seats to get out of the tiny little car, \"Your car sucks, dude.\" Harlow started to get out of the car, but was slowed down by Dalton who was taking forever to get out. \"Come on Dalton!\" Harls yelled pushing Dalton's back to get him to move faster. \"Paige, Harls, come with me.\" Carly said pushing the two in the direction of the woods. When Carly thought they were out of ear shot of Blake she asked Paige, \"Well?\" \"I couldn't.\" she said shaking her head, \"There's no point in freaking him out right now.\" \"As opposed to when you find out you're pregnant?\" Carly said looking over at Paige. \"I'm not sure, okay?\" Paige defended looking over at Blake through the trees. Sighing Paige looked from Blake back to the girls in front of her, \"He's been looking forward to this game for months, and I don't want to ruin it by starting a fight.\" Carly rolled her eyes at the blonde, \"Paige, he's not going to marry you.\" Hearing how harsh that sounded she quickly added, \"His parents won't let him.\" \"Who says she wants to get married?\" Harlow said, the first comments she had made through the conversation. \"Right, besides I've been late before.\" Paige said while giving Harls a thankful smile and Carly a hopeful look, hoping she'd just drop it. But seeing the look on Carly's face she knew no such thing would happen. Releasing a deep breath she spoke, \"When I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay?\" seeing Carly nod and Harls shrug she nodded too. \"Are we done here? Let's get out of the woods.\" Harls said already walking back to the guys. Paige and Carly went to sit on a blanket watching the boys unload everything. While Harls walked over to Nick wrapping her arms around his waist from behind. Feeling warm arms around his waist, Nick turned and wrapped his arms around her. \"Mm, what's up babe?\" Nick whispered in her ear. \"You said you were going to be nice in the car.\" Pulling Harls back so he could look in her eyes he said, \"No I said I wouldn't promise you anything.\" \"Well from now on I want you to promise to stop being such a prick to Wade please.\" \"Fine.\" Nick whispered bringing his head down closer to her lips, \"If it means that much to you, I'll try.\" \"Thank you baby.\" She said moving her lips to his. \"Yeah, don't help us or nothing.\" Dalton yelled looking at Nick who had just pulled away from Harlow. Nick looked up at Dalton and yelled back, \"Good, I wasn't planning on it!' Deciding to 'take a load off' Nick walked over and grabbed a chair, placing it next to the cooler with all the beers and soda in it. Taking the cap off one beer bottle he kicked his feet up to relax and watch all the other guys unpack everything. While Nick did that, Harlow walked to the car to get her phone out of her bag. \"Pass it! Pass it!\" Wade through his hands up for Blake to throw him the ball. Harls looked up to see Blake had gotten the football out to pass the time. She looked over too see Nick still sitting over by himself, so she decided to go keep him company. Nick looked down when he felt someone sit by his legs and smiled at his girlfriend. Harls feeling something hit her leg looked down to see the football laying there. \"Hey, Harls, a little help?\" Laughing she bent down to pick up the ball. She places her fingers in the white stitch and threw it to Blake. When she looked at the guys they were staring at her in shock. \"Where'd you learn to throw like that?\" Blake asked. Laughing she replied, \"I've got younger brothers and a boyfriend.\" As the guys got back into the game Nick got up to stand by Harls. \"That was awesome babe.\" Before she could replie a horrible smell came from the woods. Harls turned to Nick and put her nose against his sweatshirt, while Nick put his against her hair. \"Oh, my god. What's that smell?\" Carly asked. Nick turned his head to look at Dalton, \"Dalton, did you crap your pants again?\" Stuttering Dalton looked around, \"No. I don't know. Maybe,\" He started smelling his work clothes, \"I mean i'm wearing my work clothes, so…\" \"Something's dead out there.\" Wade said looking at the woods. Blake shook his head and walked over toward the group, \"No, something's dead right here. And we need to drink it back to life!\" He turned to Nick and held out his hand, \"Bless me, dog!\" Nick threw a beer his way. Harlow couldn't believe it. All the girls had dressed Dalton up. \"You're coming out.\" Carly said laughing as she stepped out of the tent, with Dalton's camera in her hand. \"I don't know.\" Dalton mumbled backing away from the entrance of the tent, \"If you don't I will be so mad.\" Shaking his head no, Dalton went to turn around to take everything off. \"Oh, no you don't.\" Harls said giving Dalton a push outside before he could completely turn around. \"Look how good you look!\" Carly exclaimed aiming the camera at Dalton. Dalton cowered back a little looking at the guys nervously waving, \"Hey.\" \"He looks like Elton John, but more gay.\" Blake's comment made Dalton's eyes go wide. \"Elton John is gay?!\" Harls busted out laughing, shaking her head. \"Only you D.\" Harls feeling a little bored with messing with Dalton she started to walk toward the cooler by Nick to get a coke. However before she could make it he pulled her down to sit on his lap. Forgetting about wanting a coke she smiled down at him cuddling closer to him to steal his warmth. She turned her head to look at the rest of the group seeing that Dalton had got his camera back and was now filming the other two couples making out. When Dalton was done with the other two couples he turned his attention on her and Nick. \"Don't even think about it. I ain't kissing you, dude.\" Nick joked at the look on Dalton's face. \"Come on, you know you want to, dude.\" Dalton joked back. Harls was just about to join in with the joking when a sudden bright light caught the groups' attention. Blake being Blake was the first one to say something, \"Hey, yo, man, you need something?\" \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade asked putting his hand in front of his face to block the light from his eyes. Playing with her lip rings Harls cuddled closer to Nick, whispering \"Umm I don't know about you guys, but I think this is what normally happens in the beginning of every horror movie.\" Blake held up his hands making a shooing motion, \"Hey, come on, man get out of here. Nothing to see here. Let's go.\" \"Can we help you?\" Wade asked getting up out of his chair. \"Maybe we're on his property?\" Carly whispered from behind Wade. Wade just shook his head, \"No, we didn't pass a gate.\" Harls looking at Wade like he was an idiot whispered back, \"We don't have to pass a gate to be on private property dumbass.\" Blake who had been looking at Harlow turned back to the truck, \"Hey man, turn off your lights!\" \"Hello!\" Wade yelled. Blake started walking forward, but Wade stopped him, \"It's alright, it's cool, man.\" Harlow who had been sitting on Nicks lap thinking about how big of idiots the guys were being was shocked when Nick all of a sudden stood up, putting her behind him, while he picked up the nearest beer bottle throwing it toward the truck, smashing the front headlight. \"Nick!\" Carly yelled looking at Nick as he made his way to the front of everyone, glaring at the truck. \"What?!\" Dalton yelled from behind Nick, feeling braver now that Nick was in front of him. The group was waiting for the person in the truck to do something, but instead they just drove away. Watching the truck drive away Harls busted out laughing, everyone turned to her, \"What? You have to admit him jumping out screaming, WHAT! Dressed like that is fucking hilarious.\" Nick laughing turned to go sit back sown with his girl but was stopped by Dalton, \"That was great, man!\" Blake walked over towards Nick slapping him on the back, \"My man Nick here's hardcore!\" Rolling her eyes at Blake, Carly went to go sit back down, \"Don't encourage him.\" Nick rolled his eyes at what his sister said and went to go sit back down himself. Rolling her eyes at the siblings, Harls sat back down on Nicks lap snuggling close to him to get warm again. \"Babe, have you ever seen any horror movies? Don't you know never to piss off the creepy dude?\" Nick laughed pulling her closer to him kissing her shoulder. \"Don't worry baby, I wouldn't let anything happen to you.\" Smiling she turned her head to give him a kiss before snuggling even closer to him being engulfed in her favorite scent as she drifted to sleep. A little while later Nick looked down to see Harls asleep. Getting up he took her to their tent they were sharing with Dalton, he changed her into a pair of his sweatpants and a t-shirt before changing himself and laying down by her. A few hours later Harls woke up cuddled to Nick, trying to remember what had woken her up, she heard a noise. Glancing down at a sleeping Nick she nudged him trying to wake him up. Getting no response she looked over at Dalton finding him sleeping peacefully. Deciding to up and look for herself, she pushed the covers off and unwound Nick's arms. Stepping outside the tent, she walked over towards the fire pit. Not seeing anything she was just about to turn around when, \"Harlow.\" Jumping she spun around to see Carly standing there. \"What are you doing out here?\" Harlow asked walking over towards Carly. \"I thought I heard something,\" she looked around the dark area before turning back to her dark haired friend in front of her, \"You?\" \"I thought I heard something too.\" \"What are you girls doing out here?\" Both girls jumped turning towards the deep voice behind them. Turning around to see it was Wade that had spoken, both girls released a breath they didn't realize they had been holding, \"We thought we heard something and none of you guys would wake up. What are you doing?\" Wade reached out to grab Carly, \"Getting you back to bed,\" looking at Harls he said, \"You should go back to your tent. There's nothing out here.\" \"Yes, dad\" Harls joked making her way back to her tent. Reaching out to grab the tent flap, she stopped when she thought she saw a shadow in the woods. Shaking her head, \"You have watched way to many horror movies.\" She whispered to herself while crawling carefully back into the tent and snuggling back up to Nick.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own House of wax. I only own Harlow... Chapter 2: The next morning Harls woke to the panicked yelling of Blake. \"Damn it! Hey, it's 2:30! Get up!\" Harls decided to try to ignore him and go back to sleep, but he just wouldn't shut up. \"Let's go, guys! Get up!\" Groaning Harlow rolled over realizing her going back to sleep wasn't going to happen. \"Wade, Dalton, let's go! We're going to miss the game.\" Harls groaning put her pillow over her head hoping to block out his voice. \"Damn it Nick! Get up!\" Harls feeling her pillow being pulled off looked over to see Nick rubbing the sleep out of his eyes looking at her. \"Hmm good morning.\" Nick said. Smiling at him she whispered. \"I could do without the screaming but morning. Laughing he watched her get up and grab a pair of white skinny jeans, a dark blue tank top, and one of his sweatshirts. Pulling off Nick's sweatpants she was just getting ready to step in her jeans when something hit the tent. \"Nick! Get the fuck up!\" Blake yelled once again. Finally putting on the jeans she turned to Nick, \"Come on babe. If you don't get up now he's just going to keep yelling.\" Seeing him sit up, Harls left the tent while pulling her tank top down the rest of the way. \"Harls.\" She heard Wade say. Turning around to face him she noticed he wasn't looking at her face, following his gaze she realized he was looking at her now covered sides. \"Yeah?\" \"You have both their names tattooed on your sides?!\" He asked looking at her like she was crazy. Laughing Harls replied, \"Yeah there my best friends. Even before me and Nick started going out he was my best friend. I like having their names on me, there always close then.\" Feeling hands snake around her waist she turned to see Nick smiling at her, \"And we that you think we're special enough to be there.\" He said while looking at Dalton who nodded he agreed. Smiling up at them Harls replied, \"Love you guys!\" \"We love you too!\" They replied while Nick leaned down to peck her on the lips. Harls, looking around noticed Paige and Carly walking towards the woods and decided to follow. Untangling herself from Nick, \"I'll be back.\" She yelled already walking towards them. \"So, you and Wade talk some more?\" Paige asked after everyone was situated. \"We're just in different places right now,\" Carly said looking from Paige to Harlow, \"He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying.\" Before either girl could comment that horrible smell from the night before came back. \"Oh, my god, there's that smell again.\" Harls looked over at Carly. \"I think it's coming from over there\" Carly said turning around to follow where she thought the smell was coming from. Looking at her like she was crazy Paige replied, \"Yeah, let's just follow the smell.\" \"What?\" Carly shrugged, \"I wanna see what it is.\" \"Why, it's disgusting.\" Paige said following closely behind followed by Harls who had been mumbling under her breath about stupid girls. \"Come on.\" \"I seriously think I'm going to throw up.\" Paige gagged while Harls covered her nose. \"Oh, my god,\" Paige said as the smell got worse, \"I hate you!\" Laughing Carly turned around to look at the two girls behind, but before she could say anything she fell down a hill. \"Shit!\" Harls yelled running forward to see if Carly was alright. \"Carly!\" Paige yelled while trying to look through the trees for her friend. \"Harlow! Paige!\" \"Are you okay?!\" Paige yelled. While Paige yelled for the boys, Harls jumped down to try and get Carly out. \"Guys, help us! Blake! Nick! Wade! Dalton!\" \"I'm stuck!\" \"Hold on Carly! We're going to get you out of there.\" Harls said while pulling on Carly's legs. \"Wade! Please help me!\" With each word Carly was getting more panicked. Seeing the guys tearing through the trees to get to them, Harlow yelled at them, \"Guys! Get down here I can't get her by myself.\" Wade ran past the other guys and slid down the hill by Harlow to help get Carly out. Paige walked over to Blake and cuddled up to him as if it was her who fell down the hill and landed in a bunch of dead shit. Harlow who had just stood back up took a few minutes to realize Nick had come up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. \"You alright, baby?\" He whispered in her ear. Smiling she leaned more into him before answering, \"Well, I'm not the one who fell face first in a pile of dead shit. So I'm actually pretty good at the moment.\" Noticing a truck pull up to the pile, they all turned to see what it was doing. \"Hey, is that the truck from last night?\" Blake asked stepping forward. \"Not unless he fixed his headlights.\" Harls said while trying to hide her smile and pinching Nick gently on the arm. Nick looking down and noticing her trying to hide her smile squeezed her sides gently before pulling her closer to him. The truck stopped and a dirty looking man stepped out. He went to the back of his truck and began throwing dead animals into the pile, acting as if he didn't see the group of seven watching him on the other side of the pile. \"Hey!\" Wade called out to get the attention of the man. \"Don't you see that?!\" Carly asked pointing to a hand sticking out of the middle of the pile. The man looked toward where Carly pointed and started making his way to it. \"Uh, I think I'm going to puke.\" Harlow said while switching positions with Nick so she could bury her face in his back so she didn't have to watch the man. \"No way,\" Wade said getting a little freaked out. \"What are you doing, man?\" Reaching where the hand was, he stopped and looked at it. He bent over and grabbed the hand, when he had a firm grasp on it he started to pull. After a couple more pulls the hand came out of the pile. \"Anyone need a hand?\" He asked holding up the hand for everyone in the group to see. \"I'm just playing. It's not real, see?\" He said while knocking on the hand to prove it was fake. \"You've got to be kidding me.\" Harls whispered while moving to stand beside Nick and Dalton. \"God.\" Carly said, rolling her eyes walking over to where Paige and Blake stood. Harls watched until Carly turned her head and nodded that she was okay. \"I found it on the road a few weeks ago.\" The man explained before asking, \"What are you guys doing here?\" While Wade filled the man in, Harls made her way over to Carly and Paige. Digging through Paige's purse Harls found a bottle of water to wash Carly off with. \"Hey, is there a gas station around here?\" Wade asked. \"I got some gas in the truck if…\" The man said pointing towards his truck, but before he could continue Wade interrupted. \"I need a fan belt.\" \"What?\" Carly asked looking at Wade. \"Just busted.\" He shrugged looking to Carly then back to the man. Rolling her eyes at the situation she went back to washing the crap off herself, \"Of course, perfect.\" \"Bo might have one, runs a station up in Ambrose.\" The man said looking up at the group. \"Where's that?\" \"Fifteen miles up the road.\" \"Let's just get one in Baton Rouge.\" Blake said cutting in wanting to get the game as soon as possible. \"Man, there's no way in hell I'm leaving my car,\" Wade shot back at Blake looking at him like he was a complete dumbass. \"What if that guy from last night comes and strips it or something?!\" \"Well, whatever man, you're going to miss the game, then.\" Blake said while rolling his eyes \"Yeah,\" He said looking over at Carly. \"Well, that's not why I came.\" \"Alright, look.\" Blake said just wanting to get the damn fan belt and get to the game. \"I'll run you up to the station. Kickoffs not for a couple hours.\" Shaking his head Wade began to argue, \"You're already late. You still gotta find a scalper and snag tickets. You guys should just go now. I'll stay with my car, it's fine. Just go and get me a fan belt on the way back, and make sure it's a 15in.\" \"Gotcha.\" Blake said while nodding. \"I'll give you a ride.\" The man spoke up looking at Wade. \"You serious?\" Wade asked in disbelief. Shrugging, the man nodded, \"If you like.\" \"Yeah? Awesome.\" He nodded making his way down the hill. \"I'm going with you.\" Carly said and began making her way down the hill towards Wade. \"Carly! No.\" Paige said. \"Yes. It'll be fine.\" She said shrugging her off. \"Alright, let's go.\" Blake said pulling Paige up the hill and back towards camp. \"Carly.\" Nick said walking towards his sister. \"What?\" She asked looking up at Nick. Instead of answering Nick took his shirt off and handed it to her to take. Harlow who had been standing by Dalton couldn't help but stare. DAMN! Her man was hot. \"Thank you.\" Carly said turning around to change her shirt but, before she did she noticed how Harlow was staring at her brother. \"Harls… Harlow!\" \"Yum.\" Harlow said before snapping her head up to look at Carly. \"Uh, opps?\" Laughing Carly went back to changing her shirt and Harls decided to look around. Seeing the man watch Carly Harls went to stand in front of her pulling Dalton along as Nick and Wade did the same. \"Come on, baby. Let's get out of here.\" Wade said grabbing Carly's hand once she was changing her shirt. Harlow turned walking back up the hill followed by Nick and Dalton. \"Man, you're just going to let them leave like that?\" Dalton asked turning around to watch the truck drive off. \"With a guy who throws road kill in a pit for a living.\" Laughing Harls shook her head, \"Dude, you clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic-Tank man. What's the difference?\" \"Well, I don't walk through it, that's one.\" Laughing the three best friends walked back towards the camp.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own House of Wax. I only own Harlow. Chapter 3: \"Dude, it's over.\" Nick said trying not to move around a lot due to his sleeping girlfriends head being in his lap. \"It'll move!\" Blake yelled from the front seat getting annoyed with everybody in the car minus the sleeping Harlow. \"Yeah? Well, it's not moving.\" Paige stated the obvious while looking at the long ass line of nonmoving cars. \"We'll make the second half.\" Blake retorted, honking the horn hoping it'd make the traffic disappear, but no such luck. \"Babe, I'm not sitting in this.\" Paige said turning from the window to look at Blake. \"What do you want me do? Blake asked desperately. \"Ugh, why don't you just turn the fucking car around?!\" Harls asked grouchily haven been woken up by all the damn yelling for the second time that day. \"I'm not missing the game the game!\" He yelled looking at everyone pleadingly hoping they'd just shut the hell up and not make him miss the game; however he knew he wasn't going to win. After all it was four against one. \"Turn. The. Car. Around.\" Nick said moving his face so it was in Blake's face. \"Come on, there probably already waiting for us.\" Paige said trying to help get him to turn the car around. \"FINE!\" Blake yelled finally getting tired of everyone. While Blake turned the car around and started heading back Harls turned her head to Paige, \"You should probably call Carly and let her know were on our way back.\" \"Why can't you do it?\" Paige asked while getting her phone out knowing no matter what it'd be her calling Carly, but still wondering why Harls didn't want to do it. \"Honestly, being rudely woken up by all your yelling hasn't made my mood the best.\" \"Okay.\" Paige replied dialing Carly's number knowing Harlow made a very good point. After knowing her for a while Paige knew Harls took her sleep very serious and being woke up twice in one day by yelling would make her a little pissy, at least until she got her coca cola in her system. \"Hey it's me, were heading back.\" Harls leaned against Nick listening to Paige and Carly's conversation to keep her mind off of how bad she wanted out of the damn truck. (Carly's side is italicized) Really, why what happened? \"Traffic. Did you guys get the fan belt thingy?\" Harls couldn't help but snort at that, she may not be a car genius but at least she knew what a damn fan belt was. No there was no one at the gas station. I don't even know where we're going right now. \"Okay, so where do you want us to pick you up?\" Just head up the road we got off at the campsite, the roads washed out at the end, so call when you get there. \"Okay, we're going to camp out again at the same place, but away from the pet cemetery.\" Cool see you then. Paige hung up as they pulled up to the campsite and filled the guys in on the plans. As Nick and Dalton went to go pee and Blake started to unload the shit, Harls and Paige started looking through some CDs. \"So, I think I'm going to talk to Blake tonight.\" Paige said knowing she could talk to Harls about this without the snippy little comments or being judged. \"Good luck dude.\" Harls said still looking at the Cds only half listening. Pausing when what Paige said finally made it to her brain she looked up at her, seeing her look so nervous she was quick to reassure her, \"You'll be fine.\" \"Hey, Paige.\" Blake called walking up. \"Yeah?\" \"Nick and Dalton are going to pick them up.\" Blake said. \"Why? We can go.\" Paige said. \"Babyyy, come on. I'm tired of driving.\" He complained. \"Alright.\" Paige sighed. While Blake walked to the guys Harls got up to follow before turning back to Paige, \"No matter what happens just know I'll be here for you.\" \"Thanks.\" Paige said looking close to tears. Harls smiled before turning back to start walking to her guys, pausing again she turned to Paige with a smirk on her face, \"Ohh yeah don't do anything I wouldn't do.\" Harlow winked before laughing and walking away. \"What wouldn't you do?\" Paige teased before Harls could get too far away. Laughing Harls walked to the guys catching Blake tossing Dalton the keys, \"Why don't you let my man here drive.\" \"Holy shit! Dalton's a man?! When did this happen and where was I?\" Harlow teased making Dalton stick his tongue out at her. Laughing she watched Blake walk away. Turning back just in time to see Nick grab Daltons nipple and twist, \"Give me the damn keys.\" \"Okay, very slow. Thank you.\" Dalton whimpered, dropping the keys in Nick's hand. Nick walked over to the driver side while Harls and Dalton turned to each other smiling, \"Shot gun! Shot gun!\" They yelled. Laughing Dalton picked Harls up and put her in the backseat, before getting in the passenger seat himself. \"Jerk.\" Harls said teasing him all the while smiling. Once they started driving Dalton got on the GPS trying to find the town. \"Just let me drive dick. He gave me the keys.\" Dalton complained ten minutes later. \"Yeah, because he thinks I'm the one who stole the car.\" Nick said while focusing on the road. \"And then crashed it.\" Harls finished. \"Whatever. Man you didn't have to cover for me.\" \"Your jackets clean, alright? Mines got plenty of stains on it,\" Nick said looking in the rearview mirror finding Harls giving him a comforting look. Smiling slightly, \"One mores not going to make a difference.\" He finished. A few moments later Dalton looked back down at the GPS. \"Hey the dude said Ambrose, right?\" Dalton asked. \"Yeah.\" Harls said \"Well the towns not on the damn GPS.\" Dalton stated, handing it to Nick. \"That's weird. Where the hell is this place?\" \"The guy said it was 15 miles up the road and Carly said there's a washed out road, so look for that.\" Harls said. After a few moments of silence, Dalton of course being the one to break it, \"SO… You think Carly and Wade are going to stay together when she moves to New York, because she be looking at me sometimes like…\" \"Dalton, it ain't happening.\" Nick said sincerely. \"And even if it were to happen?\" Harls busted out laughing at Daltons hopeful face. \"It ain't happening, nothing personal dude.\" Nick finished. \"Why? You like me better than Wade, right?\" Dalton questioned. Nick took a minute to think before answering, \"Wade's not so bad.\" \"Yeah? I like Wade too.\" Dalton added. Harls looked between the two shaking her head, \"You two are idiots!\" After about another five minutes they pulled up to the washed out road. \"Is this it?\" Dalton questioned while getting out of the truck. \"Yeah.\" Nick answered. \"Well, should we drive through it?\" Dalton asked looking from the road to the truck and back. \"Through all that?\" \"It was just a suggestion, damn. I'm pretty sure I could do it.\" Dalton said before once again looking at the road and truck, shaking his head. \"That's what I thought.\" Nick said while grabbing Harls hand and walking towards the town with Dalton following close behind after locking the truck. First of all I want to thank you guys sooooooo freakin much! You have no idea how much it means to me that you took the time to read and review my story! So thanks guys :) Leona: Thanks :) I always kind of felt bad for Vincent. I mean it wasn't his fault he had a physco as a brother... stargirl334: lol thanks :) and don't worry i'm thinking i'm going to mix it up a bit in the chapters coming up..[Chapter 5] Discliamier: I don't own house of wax. I only own Harlow. Chapter 4: \"Walking through Ambrose Harls couldn't help but think it looked like a ghost town, sure lights were on but it didn't look like anyone was around. \"Hello?\" Dalton called as the trio made their way to the gas station. \"Carly! Wade! Anyone?!\" Dalton yelled louder than before, while looking through the windows to see if anyone was there. \"Man, there's music playing but I don't think anyone's here.\" \"Who the fuck, just leaves music blasting through there speakers?\" Harls asked. Seeing no one there Nick grabbed Harls hand and started walking the opposite direction. \"Where are you going?\" Dalton asked. \"To that grocery store we passed, I'm thirsty.\" \"Dude, what about Carly and Wade?\" Dalton asked. \"Maybe they're at the store.\" Nick replied giving a little shrug. \"What?\" He asked realizing Dalton wasn't following; Harls was honestly okay going to check the store. \"I don't know, man. We came all this way. Shouldn't we go look for them?\" Dalton exclaimed. Nick sighed, \"Okay, check it. Harls and I will go this way, you go that way. If we don't find them, meet back here, and we'll go back to the road.\" He said looking from Dalton to Harls, \"Cool?\" \"Okay.\" Dalton said turning to walk in the opposite direction of Harls and Nick. \"Hey Dalton, you better be careful! If I have to come save your ass, I will never let you live it down.\" Harls called out. Dalton gave her the one finger salute smiling before turning and continuing to walk. Harls snuggled closer into Nick as they walked towards the store, it was kind of chilly out. As they got to the store they tried to open the doors only to find them locked. \"Hello?!\" Nick said, \"Yo, paying customer.\" Harls seeing no one was going to come, turned her head to look around the town. \"Babe,\" Harls said while hitting Nick on the arm, \"There's a guy at the gas station.\" Harls pointed at him when Nick turned around. Seeing the man Harls was pointing at he grabbed her hand and started making his way the short distance to the gas station where the man was standing. \"Hey,\" Nick called out getting the attention of the guy, \"I'm looking for my sister and her boyfriend.\" \"They were looking for a fan belt.\" Harls added. Shaking his head, the man walked more towards them, \"I don't think I've seen them.\" Harls couldn't help but feel like she had met this man before. Watching him look from Nick to her before going back to look at Nick only to pause and shoot his head back towards hers, his eyes looking like they were going to pop out of his head. She couldn't help but think it'd proved her feeling all the more true. \"This is the only gas station in town right?\" Nick asked not believing anything this guy said. \"That's right.\" The man agreed. \"Then they were definitely here.\" Getting aggravated the man stepped forward, \"I just told you, I didn't see them.\" \"Does someone else work here?\" Harls cut in before they could start throwing punches. \"No, I own the station, and I would have seen them.\" \"We were just here a few minutes ago, and you didn't see us.\" Harls pointed out, \"You weren't even here.\" \"Sorry. Can't help you.\" Harls only half paying attention to the man didn't miss the noise that sounded like muffled screaming, turning to look at Nick she could see he didn't miss it either. \"What was that?\" \"Nothing, just my dog.\" The man said shrugging. \"Actually, you know what? My brother Vincent was down here for a while. He could have helped your sister and her boyfriend out. They could be up at the house.\" The man said pointing in the direction Dalton had headed. As Nick turned to see what the man was pointing at, Harls couldn't help but think that name was familiar and the face that name went to had been important to her. \"No, our friend went that way earlier.\" \"Really?\" He asked looking down at his shoe to see it was untied, after a slight pause the man bent down to tie it. \"Maybe he ran into ou… MY brother up there then.\" Harls couldn't help but notice he almost said our instead of my. Especially when he through her a hopeful look. Hopeful she caught it or didn't catch it she didn't know. \"Want to head up to the house?\" No not really Harls thought but didn't stop Nick from grabbing her hand and getting ready to follow, \"Yeah, whatever.\" \"So, what's your sister look like anyway?\" The man asked looking at Nick. \"NICK! HARLS! Help me guys!\" Sooooo sorry it took me forever to update and that this chapters so short.. So long story short me and my little brother got in a fight and i fucked my wrist up.. I thought you know its just bruised or something and it'll stop hurting in a couple of days, yeah well it still fuckin hurts... Leona: Thank you for reviewing it really means a lot :) antoniabirdwell: Thanks :) and it'll be a bit of both.. gardengnome: Thanks :)[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: i don't own house of wax.. but I do own the amazing Harlow ;p Chapter 5: \"Nick! Harls! Help me!\" All three turned around at the sound of Carly's screaming. Seeing Bo's fist come flying at her out of the corner of her eye Harls ducked, while pushing Nick a little to get him out of the firing range. Moving faster than ever Harls was already running into the station without having fully straightened up. Stopping at the door she waited for Nick to get his ass inside before slamming and locking the door. Both taking off in different directions, Nick making sure the creepier couldn't get in and Harls to go find Carly. \"Carly, where the fuck are you?\" Harls yelled running into the hallway that led to stairs. \"Harls! I'm down here!\" Harls ran down the stairs skipping two at a time only stopping when she reached the door. Reaching out to turn the knob knowing it was locked already but hoping Bo was dumb enough to leave it unlocked. No such luck, and as hard as she through her body at it, it just wouldn't budge. \"Fuck! Nick! She's down here and I don't weigh enough to break the door!\" As Nick came running down the stairs Harls moved over so he could open the door. \"Carly!\" Harls exclaimed running through the door to see her taped to the chair and blood all over. \"It's okay, we've got you.\" Nick said walking over with Harls to start in untaping her so she could get out of the chair. \"Watch my finger! Watch my finger!\" Carly yelped wincing in pain. \"Fuck!\" Harls yelled looking at her finger, noticing the tip had been cut off. \"Did he do this to you?\" Nick asked gently grabbing her hand to wrap a piece of Harls shirt that she had just ripped off on it. \"Where is he?\" When neither Nick nor Harls answered to busy looking around the room she asked again, \"Where is he?!\" \"I locked him out.\" Harls replied handing Nick a blade to cut Carly's legs free since he was closer. \"Where's Wade at?\" Harls asked a question in return, having not seen him anywhere. Looking at Harls, Carly shook her head, \"I don't know. He went into the house. This place is a freak show.\" She said while getting out of the chair. \"Shit, we need to find Dalton and get out of here.\" Harls said trying not to panic while all the worst scenarios of what could be happening to Dalton were going through her head. She hoped he was ok. The sound of a turning on made the three freeze. Waiting until they could only faintly hear the truck, they each let out a breath they didn't realize they had been holding. \"Okay, wait here.\" Harls and Carly stopped at the top of the stairs while Nick ran ahead. He ran over to the garage door looking left then right. Not seeing anything he went to walk back to his girl and his sister, he stopped however seeing all the tools. He grabbed one of the wrenches before continuing. \"Alright listen, the trucks by the road...\" Seeing Harls start to shake her head back and forth he stopped and raised his eyebrow. \"I'm not leaving him! And you two can't get in, he has the keys.\" \"Shit! Dalton.\" Nick said looking around trying to think of something. \"We got to call the cops.\" He ran over to the phone on the wall only to find it dead. \"Babe, where's your phone?\" He asked Harls already patting her down to find it, finding it in her back pocket he saw there was no signal. \"Shit! Carly where's yours?\" He asked looking over at his sister. \"I dropped it in the truck, it might still be there.\" \"What about Wade? He has him. What if he turns him to wax?!\" Harls who had been looking out the window with Nick shot her head to look at Carly, so did Nick. \"What the fuck do you mean wax?!\" Harls asked, well more like yelled at Carly. \"You don't get it. There all wax everyone.\" Seeing the disbelieving looks the two were sending her she suddenly remembered the women she had seen earlier while walking through town. \"No wait.\" Carly said while walking to the door looking around to make sure no one was there before walking out the door and down the street. Harls grabbed Nicks hand and started following. \"There was a woman in here. She was alive, she pulled back the curtain.\" Nick and Harls hopped over the fence walking over towards the window. Finding a brick to stand on they jumped up to look through the window, Harls could see the lights on but as far as she could see there was no one in there. Nick and Harls weren't prepared for what happened next, as their faces were up to the glass the curtain pulled back to reveal an old women looking out the window. Harls jumped and with a yelp started falling off the brick. She hadn't noticed that Nick had jumped off the brick until he caught her before her ass met the ground. \"Fuck, thank you.\" \"You okay?\" Nick asked not letting go of her. Harls nodded turning her head to look at Carly. \"The whole town is rigged.\" Carly said walking over to look inside the window herself. \"You're saying that's a real person underneath?\" Harls asked. \"Yes, at the church they were all like that.\" \"Shit, okay come on.\" Nick said grabbing Harls hand before walking down the street. After a few minutes Harls stopped walking, pulling on Nicks hand to stop him as well. Nick stopped walking and turned to look at her. \"What babe?\" \"I've got to go get Dalton.\" Harls said looking at Nicks face. \"NO!\" Both Nick and Carly yelled. Not turning her face away from Nicks Harls spoke, \"Yes, babe there turning people into wax sculptures and I can't let him become one.\" \"Okay, we'll go with you!\" Nick said panicking at the thought of his girlfriend not being by his side with a psycho on the loose. \"No, you two need to go get Carly's phone.\" \"NO! We're going with you!\" Nick said pleadingly. \"Babe, no I'll get him and we'll meet at the house.\" \"NO!\" Seeing her face Nick knew no matter what he wouldn't win, \"Why do you have to be so damn stubborn?!\" \"I learned from the best baby.\" \"Fine, but you better come back!\" Nick said looking close to tears. \"We will.\" Harls said going to give Carly a hug. \"Be careful!\" Carly whispered to Harls while crying. \"I will.\" Harls went to Nick hugging him while giving him a kiss, \"I love you.\" \"I love you to, you better meet us at that house!\" Nick replied kissing her before reluctantly letting her go. Harls looked at them before turning and heading down the street. She was going to get her best friend and they were both going to make it. Soooooooo sorry it took me forever to upload... Okay so i kind of don't like this chapter, i think it kind of sucks to be honest... But anyway thank you guys so much for the get wells and everything :) my wrist is finally feeling better, it probably would have felt better sooner but i couldn't wrap it... haha i guess thats what i get for getting a tattoo on the hand thats fucked up...[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I don't own anything but Harlow... Chapter 6: Harls paused for a minute trying to think of where Dalton would go first to look for Wade and Carly. Remembering back to the conversation that the five of them had in Wade's car, Harls took off at a dead run to the wax museum. Slowing down once she neared the front door, Harls creeped as quietly as she could into the house. There was no way in hell she was willing to risk Dalton's or her life. Making her way through the house Harls was sure to stick close to the walls and listen for any little noise that might lead to where Dalton was. Hearing noise Harls started to follow it, coming to a stairway she could just make out what sounded like Dalton yelling at someone to wait. Running down the stairs as quickly and quetily as she could Harls saw a man with a mask standing over Dalton with two knives, this must of been bo's brother. Running over towards Dalton Harls pushed the man before he could raise the knives to hit Dalton. \"Move your ass, lets go!\" Harls yelled at Dalton while grabbing Daltons arm and running them both back towards the stairs. If she had paused for just a second she would have noticed that the man didn't make a move towards them, he was to busy staring at her like he just saw a ghost. As they made it to the front door Dalton couldn't help but start to cry a little. His life had just flashed before his eyes, he thought there was no hope that, he was really going to die. He should have known that while what Harls said before had been a joke, she still meant it. She had come to save his ass and he had never felt so blessed to have her as one of his best friends, that she would literally risk her life just to save his ass. Running up the hill to where Bo had said his house was earlier Harls pulled Dalton to the side of a buiding and brought him into a huge hug. \"Fuck D, that was so close! Are you ok?!\" Harls asked. \"Dude, I love you!\" Dalton said while hugging her ten times harder then she was hugging him. \"Shit, ok come on we have to go meet Nick and Carly at the house.\" Harls said while trying to sneakily wipe tears off her face. \"I found Wade.\" Dalton said as they started making there way up the street. \"Let me guess, he was covered in wax when you found him huh?\" Harls asked. \"How'd you know that?\" Dalton replied. \"Carly said that everyone in this fucking town were wax except for the fucking freaks who are covering everyone with the wax.\" Harls said looking at Dalton. Before Dalton could replie Harlow was grabbed from behind, instead of screaming like most people would in this sitiation Harls started elbowing the person holding her for all she was worth. \"BABE! Stop its me, its ok.\" Nick said turning her around. Throwing her arms around his neck, Harls buried her face into his chest breathing into the comforting smell that was Nick. \"Dalton you ok?\" Nick asked looking over at Dalton, not wanting to let go of Harls just yet. \"Yeah, our best friends the shit!\" Dalton replied. \"Ok, lets go guys were almost there, and freak number two was chasing us earlier.\" Carly said getting out of the hug she was giving Dalton and going to give Harls a quick hug. The four of them made there way to the house, seeing the truck Harls couldn't help but make a sarcastic comment, \"Uhh nice parking job.\" Chuckling a little at his girlfriends comment, Nick looked over at his sister, \"Do you see your phone?\" \"No, its not in here.\" Carly said. \"Shit!\" Nick exclaimed, \"Lets go check the house.\" As they walked towards the house Carly pointed out the baseball bats, grabbing one they made there way inside. *The tattoo is a star between my thumb and pointer finger.* Okay i know its taken me forever to update and i'm 1000% sorry for that. These past three weeks have been legit shit. ssooo i'm trying to get back into the swing of things but my little brother lost the computer charger (go figure) and its dead as fuck.

And sorry its short and it kind of sucks but i just had to get something up... 3 you guys, -Chels[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I don't own anything but Harlow... Chapter 7: Walking inside Nick and Dalton made sure Harls and Carly were behind them, incase any crazy people jumped out at them. Looking around and not seeing anyone they let the girls go look around. \"Look guys theres guns!\" Carly exclaimed pointing at the cabinet that held an assortments of guns. \"Its bolted down or some shit, look for a key there has to be one around here somewhere.\" Harls said after looking at what Carly had been pointing at. \"Look at these.\" Carly said going through one of the drawer that was filled with old news paper clippings. \" Siamese twins separated at birth.\" \"Freak accident causes mother/father to give up there little girl.\" Looking through the pictures Harls found one with the twins and a little girl, but before she could get a good look at the little girl in the picture she heard the sound of a truck pulling up. \"Shit! Hes back.\" Harls said as she and Carly dropped the pictures they had been looking at back into the drawer and took off to find a place to hide. Hiding under the pool table they looked around to see if they could find Nick and Dalton. Not seeing them Harls decided to worry about that later and to watch Bo. After almost throwing up having just watched him pull the arrow out and all the blood spew out of the hole. She noticed him looking at something, following his eyes she could have hit herself. How the hell could they have forgot to close the fucking drawer. Watching him as he walked closer to her and Carly's' hiding spot, she grabbed Carly's arm and started to move out from under the pool table and towards the hallway. Damn and was she glad she did that, no sooner had they hit the hallway was he looking at where they had just been. As the girls walked silently through the hall, Harls pushed Carly behind her incase anything jumped out at them, and boy was she glad she did that right as the girls turned the corner Harls was grapped sending her elbow back into whoever the hell had grabbed her Harls tried not to make a sound incase Bo heard them. Getting free Harls turned around to punch the person who had grabbed her seeing that it was Nick with Dalton right beside him she decided to hold off on knocking him out, \"Babe you have to stop fucking grabbing me!\" Harls whisper yelled to Nick. \"Sorry baby, come on guys theres a way out over here.\" Nick said grabbing Harlow's hand and leading her to the trapdoor with Dalton and Carly following them. Sorry guys its taking forever and i'm so damn sorry... sorry its short to! Lifes been a little crazy at the moment :( Love you guys though! and thanks for sticking with me![Chapter 9] Disclaimer: Don't own except Harlow, i own her :) Chapter 8: After climbing down the trap door ladder Harls started to walk down the dark hallway. Feeling two different hands grab onto me one of her arms each, Harls looked from the hands to the faces the hands belonged to, she saw that it was Nick and Dalton that had grabbed her arms. \"What?!\" Harls whisper yelled to Nick and Dalton. \"Stay behind us.\" Nick replied while him and Dalton pulled her behind them so she was by Carly. \"Fine, whatever.\" She said as they started walking down the dark creepy hallway. Reaching the end of the hallway there was an extremely dark room \"Look around, there has to be a light switch somewhere.\" Nick said. Looking around Nick saw a wall full of switches, turning each one he finally found the one to turn the light on. \"Shit! Blake!\" Harls yelled seeing him in a chair/contraption thingy covered in wax. \"Shit don't worry dude, we're going to get you out of there.\" Nick said after he turned to see what his girl had been yelling about. \"Dalton, come help.\" Nick said while grabbing onto the side metal contraption on Blake's head, waiting for Dalton to grab the other half. ' snap' \"No. Nick, No!\" Carly cried turning to bury her head in Nick's chest. Harls who had turned her head in the direction couldn't help but whimper as she saw Paige's body lying on what looked like a medical examining table. Nick turned to see what had his girl whimpering and couldn't help the 'fuck' that left his mouth. Harls turned her head back so it was facing the rest of the group, before she could however she caught sight of Vincent coming down the hallway=y. Fuck thought Harlow, \"Nick! Dalton! He's coming!\" I'm so fucking sorry guys! Things keeping messing up my uploads and shit... i\"m trying![Chapter 10] I'm sooooo fucking sorry.. craps been crazy lately I'll try to upload as soon as possible... thanks for sticking with it and all the new follows and everything... it means a lot to me :)[Chapter 11] Disclaimer: I don't own house of wax.. I only own Harlow... Turning to see what his girlfriend was pointing at Nick had just enough time to brace himself before Vincent attacked him. \"Shit!\" Nick grunted as he pushed the table into Vincent. \"Fuck!\" Harls yelled as she pushed Carly into Dalton and ran at Vincent to get him off Nick. Vincent who had left Harls alone was shocked when his back got a full load of her. Not wanting to hurt her, he gently grabbed her and pulled her so she was facing him. As he was going to push her away, Harls who had momentarily been shocked with a flashback of a younger boy giving her three year old self a piggy back ride around there living room, looked up at him, \"Vinny?\" Before Vincent could reply he found himself pushed to the ground. Looking up through the fire he found the girl who he realized the moment he had seen her was his sister be dragged away by the two guys and the girl. Pissed off he got up and grabbed the mattress from the corner of the room to walk through the fire with. Harls who had been in a freaked the fuck out haze snapped out of it when she was suddenly punched in the face. \"What the fuck?!\" Harls exclaimed as she looked up into the eyes of Bo. \"I should have killed you when I had the chance, but don't worry I won't make the same mistake twice.\" Bo said as he went to hit her again. Harls who had been prepared this time blocked it and hit him in the face. Despite the fight she put up, he was a man that outweighed her by a good 90 pounds and he quickly had her on the ground choking her. Fighting off the black spots Harls looked for anyway to get him off, seeing part of the arrow still in his shoulder Harls grabbed it, so busy focusing on the arrow Harls barely saw the bloody knife before Bo stabbed it in her leg. \"Ahhhhhh! Fuck!\" Harls yelled. As Bo was about to continue to choke Harls to death he was suddenly hit in the head with a bat. Looking up through tear filled eyes Harls had never in her life been so happy to see Carly then she was at that moment. \"Thanks.\" Harls choked out in a raspy voice. Nodding her head Carly raised the bat to keep hitting Bo, when it was suddenly taken out of her hands. Turning around to see who had taken it she started to scream seeing Vincent with the bat in his hands. Bo who looked over to see what the bitch was screaming about started laughing, \"now what are you going to do?\" thinking Vincent was on his side, so it came as a complete shock to all those in the room when Vincent lowered the bat onto Bo's head. Vincent didn't feel sorry for what he had done, he was protecting his little sister, the same little sister he had failed to protect from Bo when they were younger. Thanks to everyone who followed/faved or commented.. I really appreciate it! I'm sorry it's taken forever to update and that it's so short.. i'm hoping to update again as soon as possible.. :)[Chapter 12] Disclamier: I don't own House of Wax. I only own Harlow... Turning back to check on his baby sister, Vincent was tackled by a now standing Nick and Dalton. Throwing them off him he stood up grabbing his knife from the ground he went to finish the last three sumbass people standing in his way of finally getting his sister back. Harls having heard Carly scream out Nicks name, turned around just in time to see Vincent about to swing his blade at her boyfriends head. \"No Vinny! Please!\" Harls yelled as loud as she could, which wasn't very loud as her throat hurt like a bitch. Stopping mid-swing Vincent looked back at his sister who was still on the ground, holding her throat with that annoying bitch standing behind her. \"Please don't Vinny their important to me.\" Stopping his knife altogether he walked over to his sister, this time without being stopped. Nick who was shocked that Vincent actually stopped just becuase Harls asked him to quickly made his way over to where Harls was being helped off the ground by Vincent and then quickly being pulled into a hug by said man. \"Baby, you ok?\" Nick asked limping over and cautiously taking her from Vincent and pulling her into him being careful of both their legs. \"Fuck my life about sums up how i'm feeling. What about you?\" Harls replied while snuggiling closer to him. \"Same.\" \"Uhh guys?! We need to get the fuck out of here!\" Dalton said while pointing out to the fact that the museum was on fire. I'm soooooo sorry its taken me forever! Honestly lifes crazy thats all I can say... Thanks to everyone who followed/faved it means a lot to me! ","Summary":" I don't own House of Wax. I only own Harlow. Coming soon this is just to get to kind of know the Oc"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Siege on the Leashless","Author":"AlleyHound","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12695737","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue A sleek and powerful shepherd lay on the rug by the heater, listening, distressed, to the sobs of his master. The shepherd strained to hear the words as his man cried into the telephone, and realised what he'd feared was true; the master had been pushed out of the job that had been his life for as long as Ace had known him. Ace was a good dog, he knew and understood his master, his loves and his passions, his fears and his passions. He also knew the moment it had all gone wrong. It was a bite, a violent attack from a leashless dog, one of the vermin the master had made it his life's work to see eradicated. That hand was useless now; Ace had felt it when the master tried to fondle his ears as he always had, and he saw it as the poor master fumbled with the simplest of tasks. That a dog could inflict such misery on a human was beyond his comprehension; the dog-human bond was what made a dog, a dog. A creature that would use its teeth and claws, the gifts they were given with which to protect their masters, to wound a human, could only be evil. Ace had finally understood why the master had spent these years taking leashless dogs off the streets. But the master had it all taken from him by those vermin… now who would protect the world that humans and dogs had built side by side? Without the master to control them, how would the spread of evil, the unnatural separation of dogs from their rightful place, be halted? Ace realised that it was now down to him to do what the master could not… to protect everything he loved from the leashless dogs that crawled the city streets. Ace remembered his last encounter with one of the leashless; it was brief, but so soon after his master's wounding, its significance magnified. He and the master had been walking side by side one evening, pounding the streets near their Bronx home, when a screech of tyres and the blasting of a horn had them both turn their heads. Two leashless dogs, one large, burly and brown, and one small, white and wiry, had run in front of an oncoming car, which had swerved, narrowly avoiding a collision with a child on the sidewalk. Before Ace could so much as threaten the filthy street dogs, they were gone, melting into the alleys with such ease that they might have been cats. The master had grumbled, as he always did, and they walked on. It was clear then that it wasn't just the master's old hunting grounds of Upper Manhattan that was infested by these barely-dogs, but their very own neighbourhood. The danger was growing, and Ace knew that he had to stop it. The master had lost everything, and with every day he smelt more of the drink and smiled even less. Those vermin had ruined him. Ace had to avenge his broken master.[Chapter 2] Rita lifted her faded muzzle up from her forepaws, disturbed by the sound of, what she hoped was, Fagin coming in the front door. He was a working man now; spending his days giving service to customers in Mrs Foxworth's now-thriving boutique pet shop. There was no longer a reason that old fear in the back of Rita's mind that she and the gang might go hungry, and Fagin's job was as such that his canine companions joining him was, if anything, encouraged. All the while they all had the freedom to be the street dogs they'd always been at heart- even if they did retire to this shabby little house at the end of the day. Now ten years old and a grandmother, Rita was appreciative of the comforts this lifestyle offered her. Old age had crept up on her quickly, taking her by surprise. The fur on her face had lightened with age, the dark mask over her eyes no longer visible. After a small health scare some months ago, Rita had been given an operation to prevent her from becoming a mother again, and the change in her body had led to her silky coat growing ever fluffier. She supposed that being part-Afghan played some role in her distinct hairiness. A new, old Rita physically perhaps, but she was the same streetwise tough-talker she'd always been, and retained a position of great respect within the gang. \"I'm home, boys!\" Fagin called gaily as he pushed the creaking door open. Immediately, barking rang out from down the hall and up the stairs. A small cat, Evie, hastily darted up onto the back of the chair Rita was sitting on, wanting to be well out the way of the canine onslaught. Rita was quickly dancing around her master's feet, jumping to lick his face as he laughed heartily. It was only a few seconds, however, before she had to share his attention- Dodger and Tito, both also beginning to show their age, Oliver, and Luna- a granddaughter of Dodger and Rita, were soon all over Fagin like a rash. It didn't matter that it had only been a few hours for some of them since they'd last seen him; their old human friend arriving home always warranted a bit of excitement. Fagin waded his way through the bundle of dogs and sank into his chair with a happy sigh. These days had been kind to him; with a roof over his head, a job, and minimal rent to pay, there was rarely a thing to fret about. And he had his beloved animals around him, including his devoted Dodger. The terrier mutt jumped onto the other chair and stretched out, content. He wasn't the young trouble-maker he'd once been, having matured into a father figure to both his own offspring and theirs. Being looked up to meant a lot to him, and it was endlessly satisfying for Dodger to see the younger generations taking after himself- and Rita- in so many ways. On the old rug in the centre of the room, Luna and Tito were engaged in one of their frequent friendly tussles. Tito was no young dog now, but still had near boundless energy and a sharp mind- and tongue. He lived something of a double life, spending days at a time with his glamorous lover, Georgette in her 5th Avenue home. At heart, though, he was completely in with the gang, and there was nothing he'd rather do than spar with the youngest member of the tribe. Luna, at two years old, was now a feisty and switched-on young adult. She was a nature child, and would retreat to the city's many parks during the day, while most of her family felt more at home within the concrete jungle. Proud and independent, she kept herself fed by catching rats and squirrels; she couldn't bring herself to be a burden on Fagin, so was as self-reliant as she possibly could be. By far the youngest of the household, she'd grown up doted on by all, and she had no qualms about being openly affectionate, especially towards her grand-parents. Like Tito, she found happiness in the simple joys of rough-and-tumble, and could play for hours. Her energetic approach to life left little opportunity for the 'oldies' to slow down too much, and they'd have it no other way. With the initial home time rush over, the she-cat, Evie padded over to rub herself around Fagin's legs. Oliver joined her, and nuzzled her face. The two cats were part-time residents, spending a good chunk of their time at their other home, with Jenny. It was a school week, so spending a few nights away would not be a huge problem. It had taken a while for Oliver to adjust to this routine, ever fearful that he was somehow letting Jenny down, but she was growing up- now a young teenager, and no longer seemed so reliant on his company. He knew how very lucky he was to have not one but two loving homes; of course, there had been a time in his distant youth that he'd feared being unwanted forever. As Fagin switched on the television, everyone settled down- even Tito and Luna slowed the pace until they were both sprawled out on the carpet. Out in the yard, the last member of the household, Willow, would be settling down as well. She never went in the house, nor would she approach Fagin, but she'd nonetheless become a fixture in recent months, following the death of her usual companion, Flash. Everyone had long since given up on convincing her that her fears were irrational, but as they sheltered together, away from the cold October winds and with no shortage of good company, the others did wonder if Willow really grasped what she was missing out on. This is the life, thought Dodger, kicking back. He yawned and stretched out, brushing up close to Rita. As far as he was concerned, they had it all pretty much made. Not far from the tired little house, Dodger and Rita's daughter, Dash, was also welcoming home the rest of her gang for the evening. In a secluded alley backed onto a vast caryard, she'd set up a home with two of her closest friends, Jellybean and Klaus. A lot had changed since those early days, and the gang's numbers had swelled; born a little after Luna were Jellybean's two sons, Cocoa and Jaffa- both now strapping young males; then, a young hound by the name of Sunshine had found in Dash a trusted friend, then mate; and then there were the pups. Devoted to one another as they were, Dash and Sunny had always known puppies were in their future, and they were now parents to three six-month-old youngsters- and with another litter on the way. That the alley was getting busy was an understatement, but the band of dogs lived a harmonious life with few cares and even fewer quarrels amongst themselves. In Dash's eyes, this was everything she'd dreamed of, and she couldn't wait for the imminent arrival of her second litter, who would be welcomed whole-heartedly by a loving family. The Rottweiler, Klaus, trundled into the alley, holding in his jaws a piece of fried chicken. He dropped the food at Dash's paws. \"For you… and the passengers.\" He smiled, his eyes twinkling. \"I sought maybe they vould be here now, but maybe tomorrow. They must know we are vaiting.\" \"Thanks, Klausie. It's gotta be soon; I've been feeling little pains all day, but still no pups. Ella keeps making and remaking my nest for me; she's a sweetie, almost more excited than I am.\" The aforementioned Ella scrambled through the hole in the caryard fence to greet her 'uncle' Klaus. \"Hello! They're still not coming. I had their bed all perfect too; until crazy Daisy went and trashed it.\" Klaus wagged his stubby little tail. \"But, Ella, I sink you like to keep vorking on it. I am sure you can make it even better than perfect. No puppies will be more comfortable.\" He looked back to Dash. \"Daisy and Jack are with Sunny, no?\" \"Yeah,\" Dash nodded. \"Or at least they were when I saw them last. Chances are, Jack's run off with Cocoa and that terrier- but they won't have gone far.\" She picked up the piece of chicken and settled herself atop the broken down yellow beetle that was the alley's centrepiece. Jellybean, draped over the bonnet, huffed. \"Those boys better not be too late. I'd actually be relieved if Jack's tagging along with Cocoa and Lucky; then at least one of the three would have some sense.\" Her son, Cocoa, was a protective mother's nightmare; eager to show his strength and impress the rougher dogs of the city. He was as gregarious as Jellybean, which was no surprise, but his need to play the tough guy had gotten him into hot water on more than one occasion. The scruffy young terrier, Lucky, was no better, serving to egg on his much larger, stronger friend. Young Jack looked up to and admired Cocoa, who'd been excited to act as a teacher to the boy pup since he first started to crawl around. Jack always took life seriously, and his tendency to think things through before barging into a situation made him, in Jellybean's mind, a good influence on his much older- but not wiser- friends. Dash snapped a yawn, her back aching. \"You're not wrong.\" Jellybean's other son, Jaffa, was next to come around the corner. He had a bread roll as an offering to the pregnant leader. \"Sorry, not sure how fresh it is, but it's all I could find.\" \"Thanks, Jaffa,\" Dash said, smiling warmly. \"It's very much appreciated. I feel like a useless wreck right now.\" \"But you're doing the most important job! Keeping those puppies safe until they're ready.\" Jaffa wagged his tail. Like most of the gang, he was now on tenterhooks, knowing that the arrival could happen at any time. He was smaller than Cocoa, and softer in temperament. With a knack for silliness, he had a way with puppies, and couldn't wait to meet his new 'cousins'. Spotting Ella behind the car, he jumped into a play bow. \"Ellsy-bellsy, wanna give home reno a break and have some real fun?\" Ella ran forward and tumbled onto his lowered back, laughing through her growls. They snapped and pawed, enjoying a bit of frivolity. Dash yawned again, even wider this time. \"I wish I had that much energy.\" She sighed. \"I've been restless all day; it feels like something more should have happened, but it's all happening so slow.\" \"I still say, tomorrow,\" Klaus wuffed, plonking himself down on the ground near his friends. \"They'll be here before you know it,\" said Jellybean. \"Rest up while you still can!\" Before long, the rest of the gang was home, with Sunny at the very front of the queue to check on Dash's well-being. Her early pains had progressed, and to the immense excitement of everyone, labour had started. Almost tripping over his paws in anticipation, Sunshine led his mate to the whelping den. The old man who owned the caryard had long been appreciative of the security given by the small band of dogs, and had erected a second fence into his property, effectively giving the dogs a safe and contained space that they might retreat to should a threat come their way. It was this space that Ella had been spending the day dressing up with cushions, blankets and newspaper, making it a cosy space for the arrival to take place. \"Okay, Dash, keep breathing,\" Sunny panted, though he knew his advice was too obvious to be of any real use. \"Do you want me to stay in here with you?\" He'd been present for much of the first labour, but didn't want to make assumptions; what mattered was that Dash was comfortable. Dash collapsed into the blankets and whined in pain. \"Stay… please.\" This was as hard as she'd remembered it, and she knew this was just the beginning. A strong contraction going through her, she dug into the bedding and looked into Sunny's softly reassuring gaze. \"Lie with me?\" Placing himself close to Dash, Sunny allowed himself to be her rock. If she needed to lash out with the pain of it all, he'd be going through it with her. With Daisy, Ella and Jack being kept occupied and reassured on the other side of the fence, he put all his energy into being everything Dash needed of him. \" Hello? Hello, is anyone awake?\" Rita looked up from her slumber and blearily exchanged a brief look of confusion with Dodger. Half-asleep, she couldn't quite place the voice. \"Sunny?\" Dodger asked, sleepily. That was strange… beyond strange. Why would Sunny be showing up here in the middle of the night? Luna blinked awake. \"Is someone here?\" Pulling himself to his feet, Dodger tried to wake up. He wasn't imagining it; Sunny was there. \"Watcha doin' here, man?\" he called down the stairs. His eyes rested on the dog beside Sunny, his daughter, Dash, sprawled on the floor and panting heavily. \"Dash! What's the matter? What happened?\" Dash whined. \"They won't come. I've been pushing since sundown, but they won't come.\" \"Something's not right,\" Sunny said, his voice cracking with emotion. \"It shouldn't be like this.\" Dodger swallowed, taking in the weight of what was happening and feeling a wave of fear for his Dash. \"I'll get Fagin, just wait there.\" As a wide-eyed and frightened Rita rushed to her daughter's side, Dash began to weep. From deep in her bones she knew that her puppies were in serious trouble, and she couldn't hold back her tears any longer. The three youngsters ran forward out of the shadows to comfort their mother. \"Grandma Rita, is Mom gonna be all right?\" Daisy asked, hushed. Rita, calmly as she could, gave the child a reassuring lick. \"We're getting help,\" was all she could say. She pressed her thin body close to Dash, and felt the struggling bitch weakly press back. \"I'm here, Dashie; I'm here.\" Sleepy and confused, Fagin nonetheless was quick to act at the sight of Dash; a dog who'd been a close companion of his for the early years of her life, clearly in great distress. Gently he bundled her into a blanket and carried her in his arms to his scooter, having made a panicked flip through the phone book to find an emergency vet that could see her at this time in the morning. Sunny could only look on, shell-shocked, barely able to move and act. He tried to follow after Fagin, to go with Dash, but they were gone before he could begin to wrap his head around it all. Sunny wasn't the only one overwhelmed by all that was suddenly going on. Having been so abruptly woken, the gang was in a state of dazed confusion. No longer able to be by Dash's side, Rita went to the three pups, who all had expressions of abject fear on their faces… for all they knew, they might never see their mother again. Luna yawned widely, coming into the room and taken aback by the sight of so many dogs milling around. \"What's going on, pops?\" she asked Dodger, who'd been trying to reassure Sunny. \"Dash is havin' problems gettin' her puppies out. Fagin's takin' her to the vet; we've just gotta wait and hope everythin's all right.\" Dodger looked over Dash's three elder pups; he had to stifle his own fears for their sake. The look in his daughter's eyes, a look of terror and suffering, had shaken him to the core. Dash was a healthy young dog; she'd be okay… wouldn't she? The doubt must have begun to show, as Luna too looked as though she might burst into tears. Feeling himself begin to shake, Dodger gave Sunny a kind nudge. \"Don't worry, man. You know she's a lot tougher than she looks.\" \"I know,\" Sunny said, with a weak attempt at a smile. \"I've gotta trust she can do this.\" He lowered his head, apologetic for the drama he'd brought on the family at such an unsociable hour. \"You don't mind if we all stick round here while we wait? Jelly's out the back with her boys- Klaus too. They'd want to know any news as soon as possible.\" Daisy, Ella and Jack all looked to Dodger, but a shaky Luna spoke first. \"Just try and make yourselves comfortable… you can't have much sleep last night,\" she said, kindly. \"We'll wake you if Fagin comes back with news.\" Rita nodded firmly. It would no doubt be stressful for the dog-phobic Evie- who remained hidden upstairs with her beloved Oliver- but this was an emergency, and emergencies called for them all to stick together. \"Yeah, man,\" Tito piped up. \"You're not goin' anywhere! Uncle Tito will take care of you, all right?\" Soon, the three youngsters were piled up on the sofa, surrounded by the soothing and protective presence of their grandmother and cousin, while Tito rushed up the stairs to inform the cats of the situation. Sunny failed to suppress a whine as he looked at his kids. He blamed himself. They hadn't needed another litter; they'd been happy enough. Those pups were now suffering, Dash was now suffering, because he'd wanted too much. Before going outside to update the rest of the family on the situation, he rushed over to give the pups each a gentle kiss and a nuzzle. \"C'mon, Sunny,\" said Dodger gently. \"Get yourself comfortable. You wanna be there for your kids, we'll handle the rest.\" He wasn't sure how the next few hours would play out, and could only take care of the family that were there in that moment. Each passing minute would go by ever slower, but wait and hope was all there was to do. Together, though, their thoughts were all with Dash and the unborn puppies.[Chapter 3] Indistinct voices crept in through fog in Dash's head, and she could not so much as determine whether they were human or canine. It was as though her whole being had been encased in a ball of cotton wool, muffling all sound, sight, scent… even her thoughts. Her eyes barely open, Dash couldn't make out where she was; there was a purple blanket under her for warmth so, she managed to deduce after lying confused for several long minutes, she could not be anywhere too bad. Slowly, the voices became clearer, and just as the memory of what had happened began to came back to her, a nudge to her side brought Dash back to reality with a jolt. She remembered! Her vision blurred and movements clumsy, she heaved her weary head up to look down at her pups for the first time. But there was just the one. No, Dash thought, no, there were more than that; I felt them. It was more than last time. Her mouth dry, she licked her lips and looked away. It was just a trick of her senses; something that the vet had given her stopped her from seeing what was really there, what had to be there. Now that she'd turned away, Dash found herself afraid to look back, even as she felt a pup- the puppy she could not bring herself to believe was the only one, rooting hungrily at her side. Her senses were sharpening; she could make out the dogs on the other side of the vet hospital, and distinguish the voices of the different voices. What would she see when she looked back down at her puppy- her puppies ? A cold, hollow feeling threatened to take her over, a dread that swept through entire body. A squeak came from Dash's side. Her maternal instincts triggered, she couldn't stop herself from looking down to her crying puppy. She gave a horrified gasp and a dry sob as she realised it was true. Only one puppy. \"I'm sorry, darling,\" came the voice of one of the nurses, whose shadow fell over Dash's cage, \"the others didn't make it. But you've got quite a fighter there, girl; she's going to be a strong one.\" Dash felt tears welling in her eyes. Her babies. She'd felt them, known them, carried them; how could they be gone just like that? She rearranged herself slightly to make it easier for the surviving puppy to feed, and saw on her belly a large shaved patch and an ugly scar. Dash shuddered. The mark was one she'd carry with her; a souvenir of the death of her puppies. While she let the survivor feed, she couldn't bear to look down any longer and had to turn away. She lay her head down in her forepaws; the feel of a nursing pup bringing only a deep sadness rather than the overwhelming joy she'd been anticipating. Trying to ignore the sensation, Dash let her heavy eyelids close. Perhaps she'd wake up to find this was just a terrible dream. A piercing squeal roused Dash from her sleep. Taken by surprise, she lifted her head quickly, and again saw the lone pup against her side. In just a moment, the grief all came flooding back. The puppy squealed again, and Dash moved her muzzle forward to comfort the baby. Poor little thing, all alone. Amidst the heartbreak, a warmth surged through Dash's body, taking her by surprise. How could she look at this child and feel nothing but sadness? This was her baby, the one who would fight through, and Dash would be beside her all the way. \"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry,\" Dash whispered, \"if I could have saved them…\" Her voice caught in her throat. She didn't suppose it mattered; the pup was too young to hear anyway. \"But I'm here. I'm here, and you've got a daddy and a brother and sisters and they can't wait to meet you.\" Tenderly, Dash licked her little daughter and knew that such a precious child was worth whatever heartache had to be endured in bringing her to the world. The pup was indeed big and strong; bigger than any of Dash's first litter had been. She had brown fur, a little darker than her mother's, and white paws like her father, Sunny. For a moment, the thought of Sunny almost had Dash in tears all over again- he would surely be devastated to have lost most of his litter, but she was determined not to let grief get in the way of loving her little survivor. This was the puppy's first day, and it couldn't be remembered just with sadness. The puppy gave a satisfied exhale, and collapsed onto her face against her mother's belly. Dash smiled affectionately; her baby daughter truly was a beautiful little thing. \"Come on, little one, come here,\" Dash murmured, and she gently picked the puppy up in her mouth, and placed her against the long hair on her chest. \"See, that's better. Nice and warm.\" Dash curled her legs up against her belly so that the terrible scar was hidden. She couldn't stand to look at it; it stood for sorrow and loss. She'd never forget the little ones who didn't make it, nor truly lose that hollow feeling inside- how could she?- but for now, Dash knew where her energies needed to be, and that was in supporting her beautiful, soft, perfect baby daughter. The puppy closed her eyes, and tummy full, soon fell asleep in her mother's loving embrace. Dash felt a bittersweet tear roll down her check as she listened to the contented sleep-snuffling of her baby. It felt as though her heart had been broken into a million pieces, but still, in this puppy she had hope. Dash and the baby puppy were met with a sea of concerned eyes and licking tongues as Fagin helped them through his front door. Once again forced to face the reality of her loss, Dash immediately felt tears forming, though her sweet Sunshine was quick to kiss them away. \"Oh, Dashie, I'm sorry,\" he whimpered. \"Is the baby all right?\" With a trembling smile, Dash nuzzled him back. \"Our little survivor's strong as they come. She's perfect.\" She looked up into Fagin's hand, where the slumbering babe lay and felt another strong rush of love. Ella's eyes were wide with anxiety for her mother. \"I made you another nest, Mom,\" she said. \"Under the stairs, so it's nice and cosy.\" Appreciative, Dash gingerly followed her daughter to the hidey-hole beneath the stairs, keeping one eye up at Fagin's hands, where the puppy was safely held. She lay down, nudging the bedding into a comfortable position. She looked up at Ella. \"It's perfect, beauty.\" Fagin gently held out the puppy to Dash, who took her to her side. \"There's a good girl,\" he murmured. \"I know it's been rough, but we'll take care of you now.\" Sunny scooted in behind Dash, allowing her to snuggle close for comfort, and the three elder pups soon joined them. Rita watched from the side, her heart aching at the sight of her daughter dealing with such loss. She approached slowly, and reached over to nuzzle Dash's face. \"I'm gonna be okay, you know,\" Dash said weakly. \"I know,\" said Rita. \"You're strong as they come. I'm here if you need anything though- anything at all.\" Dodger nodded. \"Absitively, Mini. We're here for ya.\" Dash lay down her head, her squirming baby right beside her. \"Thanks; thanks so much.\" Rita walked away, leaving the new family to rest and reaffirm their bonds. She herself was shaken and stunned by the dramatic birth, and with Dash and the survivor doing well, she could finally breathe and take it all in. In the past hours, the house had been a stressful place to be, with Jellybean and her sons pacing restlessly out the back door and barking ferociously every time they caught sight of Fagin. All the while, there had always been at least one of Dash and Sunny's older pups in fretful tears, and poor Sunny had needed all the help he could get to keep everyone calm. Upstairs, the dog-phobic Evie would be cowering away from all the activity, no doubt with Oliver steadfastly trying to reassure her that she was safe. It left Rita feeling torn, unable to take care of everyone all at once. Confident that- for now at least- Dash would be just fine, she turned her attention to the dogs in the backyard, who'd not yet seen the new addition to the family. Outside the back door, the relentless pacing had left a long and muddy gouge in the already patchy lawn, and still Jellybean kept walking back and forth. At the sight of Rita, her ears pricked. \"Is Dash okay?\" Jellybean urged, beginning to shake as she stopped her incessant pacing. \"The… the baby?\" \"She's fine. Exhausted, and it's going to be a lot to deal with, but she's strong. The baby's a little girl; healthy and perfect.\" Jellybean exhaled loudly and collapsed into the dirt. Immediately, her adoptive mother, Willow, rushed in to comfort her. If any of the dogs had an inkling of what Dash might be feeling, it was Jellybean, who'd lost almost all of her own newborn puppies two years before. Such memories could not easily be held back at a time of fear and distress. Klaus stood up, his eyes wide. He had no qualms about going in the house, but felt his support had been of greater need with Jellybean's clan. Now though, Dash needed to know that he was there for her. \"Is she well enough to see visitor? I vould like to see her, and puppy. She has been so brave, I vant to tell her sat.\" \"I think she's trying to get some sleep,\" Rita said gently, appreciating Klaus' love and care for his dear friend. \"But you're welcome to hang around close by; I think even that will mean a lot.\" \" Danke , Mutter Rita.\" Jellybean lowered her head and gazed into the house. She had to be there for Dash- she owed her that much. But the strong smell of human held her back. How could she trust herself to hold back her fear enough to keep from lashing out towards the human? That would help no one, least of all the tired and grieving Dash. Still, Jellybean could not shake the feeling that she was letting her old friend down… the same friend who was the very reason her Cocoa and Jaffa were alive today. She stifled a whine. Jaffa had calmed visibly with the assurance that Dash and the new puppy were safe and well. He cocked his head enquiringly. \"So, what happens next? Are they well enough to come home?\" \"I don't think so, Jaff,\" Rita said, shaking her head. \"They had to cut a hole in her to get the puppy out; she's going to be so sore. I've been knocked out at the vet myself, and I can tell you, it really drains you. It took days for me to recover- and I didn't have to deal with the emotional trauma of losing puppies.\" \"Poor Dash,\" said Jaffa quietly. He'd always thought of Dash as an aunt; it was hard not to when she had been so pivotal in getting him through his early days, and it hurt to think of her suffering. His instincts and mistrust of Fagin told him that the sooner they all got home, the better, but he had faith in his elders to do what was right. Cocoa frowned. \"How long will we be waiting here, then?\" he asked. \"I get that she needs to rest, but we can't take care of her properly while she's in there, and none of us are gonna want to hang out in your yard indefinitely.\" Jellybean nodded. \"I want to be able to help her, Rita. I don't know how to do that at the moment.\" Rita nuzzled her niece's broad face. \"I know, Bean. But right now, I don't think any of us can really do anything except make sure she's got enough food. She's going to need to keep warm after the operation, so it's best she stays inside for now. She keeps getting the shivers as it is.\" Jellybean and Cocoa didn't look placated, but Rita didn't know what else she had to offer. \"I think we've just got to wait until the initial shock is over, then have a talk all together to work things out. Dash isn't in a fit state to decide anything at the moment. You guys are welcome to camp out here, but if you go back to the alley, you know we'll get to you right away if anything changes.\" \"Okay,\" Jellybean said with a sigh. \"I'll be sticking around here; I don't want Dash ever thinking I'd walk away from her.\" Her two boys nodded, though Cocoa still looked unsure. \"Votever she needs,\" said Klaus, he too nodding his head. \"She vould do same for us.\" The following days were not an easy ride. Cooped up, unable to tear herself away from her mother and the baby for fear of anything going wrong again, Daisy was bouncing off the walls and loudly taking out her frustrations on just about everyone. Sunny, equally anxious, was also fidgety, and felt helpless to do anything to calm his daughter while he himself felt on the edge of a meltdown. The new baby puppy remained strong and healthy, but Sunny didn't dare relax. In his eyes, Dash needed him to be ever-alert, so she could rest and recover from the birth. Whenever the infant, who had now been given a name- Phoebe- was not feeding, she was more often than not nestled between a doting Ella's forepaws. Dash was happy to let Ella puppysit, albeit under her own watchful eye. She tried her best to be attentive, but she was still very sleepy and weepy, all of which increased her feeling that she was letting little Phoebe down. Of all the family, Jack was the most together. He busied himself in collecting food, and keeping the rest of the gang updated on the situation. Jack wanted dearly to be able to keep the rambunctious and over-emotional Daisy out of their mother's way, but could not see a way of doing so without creating further drama. He sported an almost permanent worried expression, as he tried to remain strong for the rest of his family. Out in the yard, tensions were, if anything, even higher. The dogs left during the day, but always came back to an environment where none bar Klaus felt remotely secure. Jellybean was hugely grateful that at least she had her mother around to offer a shoulder, but she couldn't help but worry about Dash. The boys would go berserk barking at any point Fagin came into view, and the result was that everyone's nerves were frayed. That barking had also led to the cat, Evie, retreating back to the Foxworths' place for the foreseeable- though no doubt Daisy's attempts to chase her had not helped put her at ease either. It was clear that something had to give, and a meeting was called. As the gathering got underway, Sunny took over the job of keeping Phoebe safe and warm, allowing Dash- the leader of their clan and the one around whom recent drama had revolved- to work on the solution. The dogs, along with Oliver, gathered in a circle in the backyard, and all eyes were on the new mother. Jellybean, Cocoa and Jaffa had barely seen her since the birth. \"All right, troops,\" Dodger began, naturally taking the lead. \"It's been a crazy few days for all of us, but hopefully we'll be able to sort something out.\" He too looked to Dash, who took a breath. \"I think,\" she said, \"that the best thing for me and Phoebe, will be to stay on here for a while longer. It's getting colder with every day, and if I don't have to subject her to that, I won't.\" Klaus nodded in understanding, but beside him, Cocoa was none too impressed. \"Let us take care of her- that's what we're here for! She should be raised by her whole family.\" Jellybean gave her son a stern look. \"It's not your choice, Cocoa. New York winters are harsh on a small puppy, and I doubt it would be wise to overlook a warmer refuge.\" Dash was surprised by her friend's response, but appreciative. \"I get it, Cocoa. This isn't what any of us had planned, but it's not just the cold either; I'm not as strong as I should be. I want to be fit to enjoy her puppyhood and play with Phoebe like a mother should. I'll recover quicker here.\" Cocoa gave a muffled growl, but didn't argue the point. He knew that changing the mind of a protective mother could be near impossible. \"Do you want us all to stay here?\" \"No,\" Dash replied, and she looked to Dodger checking for his approval- this was his home after all, \"No, I don't think so. It's overcrowded here, and it's only causing stress for everyone. None of you can really relax in a human home. That's fine, but it means we're going to have to split for the time being.\" \"Are you sure?\" Jellybean's expression was one of hurt. She understood; of course, she understood, as a mother herself. \"I'm sure. I don't want you guys holed up indefinitely; it isn't fair. Best not to have the alley sitting empty for too long either. You need to focus on taking care of yourselves; it's not just Phoebe the winter's going to be hard on.\" Seeing the look on Cocoa's face, Jack piped up. \"Is it okay if I go back to the alley too?\" he asked. \"I feel like I'm getting in the way here, and it'd be kinda nice to hang out with Cocoa and Lucky instead.\" As he'd expected, Cocoa's expression brightened. \"Of course, it is,\" said Dash, \"just drop by when you can. I'll miss you like crazy- and your baby sister's not going to be small for long.\" Daisy made a sound of protest. Her brother wasn't always the most fun, but she was still happiest when he was around with the rest of the family. More and more, Jack was much more interested in hanging out with the older Cocoa and Lucky. She suspected that her rambunctious approach to life got on his nerves… she probably even got on Ella's nerves sometimes, but in her eyes the siblings were better all together. \"Don't worry, Dais,\" Luna said, with a merry wag of her tail. \"once it's not so crowded, you and I will have more room to let off steam. You'll feel better, I'm sure.\" Klaus looked to Dodger, Rita, Tito and Luna in turn, \"Sank you for letting us stay these past days. It has meant much that Dash and baby are safe. Ve vill visit often, yes?\" \"Please do,\" said Rita. She'd always liked Klaus, and felt he could comfortably have stayed around if he hadn't felt committed to Jellybean and the boys. Dash and her friends exchanged tender nuzzles and licks, a farewell for now. \"I've got to get back to the baby; see you guys round, okay?\" She gave Jack one last kiss. \"Drop by whenever, don't let me miss you too much.\" Klaus, Jaffa, Cocoa and Jack left through the gap in the fence, leaving Jellybean behind, looking down the doorway that Dash had disappeared into. She whined. \"Honey, she's gonna be just fine,\" Rita reassured. As Daisy and Ella made to follow their mother, she called to them. \"Hey, you two want to come out with us? You've been cooped up way too long.\" Sunny appeared in the doorway. \"I think that's a good idea; I'm getting a little bit stir-crazy myself. Let's give your mom some peace and quiet for a change,\" he said. \"Don't worry,\" he added, seeing nervousness in their faces, \"Mom and Phoebe are perfectly fine; it's about time we started getting back into the swing of things.\" With Dodger and the gang taking the rest of her family with them, Jellybean was left alone. Though, rationally, she knew it was safe to leave Dash, she couldn't shake the worry that something might happen if she was no longer there to stand guard. How could she be sure the infant would survive? She'd never seen Phoebe, whom she imagined to be sad and sickly, as her own puppies had been. Slowly, Jellybean approached the doorway and peered in. The human had left for work long ago… what danger was there really in paying mother and child a visit. She couldn't just walk away without seeing with her own eyes that they were safe. Jellybean was trembling as she took her first tentative steps onto the scratched wooden floor. Her ears pricked, even knowing that Fagin had certainly, definitely left for the day. The creak of the floor beneath her heavy paws, caused her to startle, but still she kept walking. \"Hello?\" she called out nervously. Dash's incredulous voice drifted back to her in reply. \"Jelly? J.B., is that you?\" The mastiff-mix broke into trot, sure that she'd feel more comfortable once her friend was in sight. There was Dash, reclining beneath the stairs… a squirming baby puppy at her side. \"So, this is your little Phoebe? Dashie, she's gorgeous!\" Stunned to see Jellybean in a human home, Dash was momentarily at a loss for words, but gently nudged Phoebe towards her huge 'aunt', who'd come in close. \"This is Phoebe. The little monster behind all the upheaval.\" Jellybean sniffed and smiled. \"It's all gonna be worth it to have you both properly looked after.\" She paused. \"I wish I could do more… after everything you did for me and my boys, I can't even stand by you. I'm sorry, Dash.\" \"J, don't be!\" Dash shook her head. \"This isn't what any of us expected. A part of me feels like I'm letting you all down, but I'm so scared of anything happening to her…\" \"It's all right; I get it. Your first responsibility is to your baby, and nothing we could do would make a warmer shelter than what she's got now. You need to heal up, be strong; and it'll be easier for you to do that here. I'll bet anything your folks are gonna treat you like a queen.\" Dash leaned over to nuzzle Jellybean's face. \"You would, too. You came in here to see us; that's huge. I can't say what it means.\" Jellybean gave a last, long look at the tiny puppy. \"I should go,\" she said. \"You take care, all right?\" \"I'll try,\" Dash said, with a warm smile. \"See you soon, girlfriend.\" Trundling back out into the open air, Jellybean felt herself begin to breathe normally again; being in that house had affected her more than she'd realised. The adrenalin had gotten her through, that and the need to personally welcome the newest member of the family, but she was so glad to be out of there. Her eye caught her mother's. Willow had apparently left the main group to check after her; and her expression was one of fascination. \"You must think I'm real foolish, going in there…\" Willow shook her head. She'd raised Jellybean to fear humans for her own protection, having suffered greatly at their hands herself. And yet, she couldn't help but admire her daughter's courage in the face of all she'd been taught. After all, the human that lived in that house was the same person who'd just saved the lives of Dash and Phoebe… was the danger all in their heads? \"Being there for your friend was more important than your fear. I'm proud of you.\" Surprised, Jellybean gave Willow a sheepish smile. \"Thanks, Mom,\" she said, and then pushed through the fence to follow her sons home, her mind finally at ease.[Chapter 4] A cold late-autumn morning saw Rita hanging out the upstairs window, her long legs draped down the slope of the roof as she sat in the windowsill. These days, she took life at a slow pace, not least because of the great draw to stay home with her daughter and infant grand-daughter. Initial fears for Phoebe's ability to thrive after her dramatic entrance to the world had all been for naught; the pup had gone from strength to strength, and at almost a month old was just beginning to learn to run and play. It was an exciting time for the close family, especially as they were grateful to have the bumbling puppy around at all. Time had been a healer for Dash, whose physical and emotional scars had faded- they'd had to; there was no time for moping with an increasingly energetic pup and her restless elder sisters to tend to. Rita and Dash had picked up where they left off when the daughter first left home years ago, and the result was that they'd come through Phoebe's early days with a strong sense of family unity. In no rush to go anywhere, Rita had let Dodger, Tito and Luna hit the streets without her. She was happy just to take it easy, and enjoy the presence of her extended family for this brief time they were close. Yawning contentedly, Rita's eye was suddenly caught by two figures on the streets below. One was no surprise, the scruffy form of her sister, Willow, who was rarely far from the house, but the second figure was that of a dog she'd not laid eyes on for many, many months. It was her father. In seconds, Rita was on her feet, and racing down the stairs to be by their side. Storm was limping, a deep gash on his forearm. His old face was tired and pained, and he winced with each step. Willow carefully helped him along, her expression full of concern. Recovering quickly from the shock of seeing her father in such a terrible state, Rita ran over with eyes wide. \"What happened?\" she gasped. \"Are you okay?\" \"Some psychos jumped us,\" Willow growled. \"They must have seen a couple of old dogs and thought we were easy pickings.\" Storm gave Rita a nuzzle to the face. \"I'm fine, Rit; I've had worse, honest.\" Rita frowned. She'd not encountered vicious dogs who'd attack unprovoked- not in this neighbourhood, where the few street dogs around all knew one another by sight and co-existed with little drama. \"No one either of you recognised?\" \"No,\" said Willow, \"I don't think they were even street. They had collars.\" She guided her father down to a soft patch of grass to rest on. \"It took us both by surprise.\" \"Don't worry, Rita,\" said Storm with a warm smile that lifted his tired features, \"they realised pretty quickly that they underestimated us. I just hope they learn their lesson and stick to fetching their masters' slippers from now on.\" Rita licked his wound tenderly, exchanging a worried glance with Willow. It wasn't a serious wound, but their father was not as young or strong as he once had been. The looks on their faces must have caught Storm's attention, as he was quick to shake himself off. \"Give me a little while to rest and I'll be back on my feet. We should go out into the city tonight, the three of us together.\" Catching sight of the reunion, Dash charged into the backyard, leaving little Phoebe toddling along behind her. \"Grandpa!\" she called, gaily. \"It's been so long! How are you?\" Storm beamed and wagged his tail. \"I can't quite seem to stay out of trouble,\" he said, gesturing to his shoulder, \"but that's nothing next to what you've been up to. I hear you've got someone special to introduce me to.\" Dash's eyes lingered on her grandfather's wound, but took his lead on shrugging it off. She knew from experience that many dogs were too proud to have attention drawn to weaknesses. Instead, she looked behind and motioned Phoebe forward. The small puppy, just starting to find her feet, tripped and tumbled in her excitement to acquaint herself with this new figure. In her short life, she'd seen many dogs come and go through the house, and she greeted all with curiosity and enthusiasm. \"This is Phoebe, our youngest,\" Dash said proudly, as the pup eagerly sniffed at the old dog. \"Jack's moved back to the alley with the rest of the guys, but Ella and Daisy will be around here somewhere. I'm sure they'll be thrilled to see you again.\" Storm tickled the pup with his teeth, causing her to giggle. At his advanced age, having the opportunity to see a new member of the family was a blessing, and he couldn't be happier to see that after Dash's ordeal, the survivor was thriving. \"Congratulations, Dash.\" With their father seeming bright enough despite the earlier attack, Rita and Willow both settled down on the grass, putting worries aside to enjoy a rare gathering of four generations all together. Ella, Dash's middle daughter, was foraging through trashcans, keen to find food for her little sister, who was beginning to be weaned. In the past few weeks, her whole world had revolved around Phoebe, who'd stirred strong protective instincts in her. From the day Phoebe arrived home and was placed in the warm nest Ella had lovingly pulled together, every stage of the infant's development had been observed by her older sister with wide eyes and a heart swollen with affection. Ella knew that Dash appreciated all the help, and the mother-daughter relationship had been strengthened despite the emotional turbulence of those early days. With Phoebe beginning to interact, laugh and play with those around her, the relationship Ella had been eagerly awaiting since the news that Dash announced her pregnancy could begin to bloom. She'd be right by her sister's side; introducing her to her first foods, showing her the sights and scents of the backyard, and, of course, being constantly on call for cuddles and snuggles. So far, however, the little one seemed to look right past Ella, giggling instead at the antics of the eldest sister, Daisy. All Ella could do was shake it off… she'd just have to try harder. Another dog, a young male with a shiny, deep red coat came trotted down the alley towards Ella, his tail wagging. She looked up, and her own tail immediately began to wag. \"Hey, Jaff,\" said Ella brightly. \"What took you so long? I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.\" Jaffa's happy expression became one of guilt. As a young dog trying to strike out on his own, spending time with friends and family seemed to have fallen by the wayside. \"I know, I'm sorry. I'm glad I caught you now, 'cause it's probably gonna be even longer.\" \"What do you mean?\" Ella's frantically wagging tail slowed. She'd been wrapped up with her new sister, sure, but she'd always made time to stop by to check to see if Jaffa was around. They'd been friends all her life, and friends made an effort for one another. \"I mean, I've been hanging with the rest of the family for a long time now. Most street dogs of two-years-old would have started to make their own way in the world… you know Cocoa's only staying until Jack's grown up enough to come with him and Lucky.\" \"Yeah, but that's Cocoa! He wants to throw his weight around and make a reputation for himself. You're not like that. Aren't you happy?\" Jaffa bit his lip, worried about making Ella understand without hurting her feelings. He'd been one of her favourite playmates since she was small, always looking up to him. He loved her mischievous streak, and her knack of making him laugh if ever he was down. He'd miss all that, but he wasn't a pup anymore. \"Of course, I'm happy. I've got my mom, Klaus, Cocoa, you and your mom, dad and the others. We have a laugh, and it's fun. But there's a big world out there, and I haven't really seen any of it.\" Ella sat down on her haunches, feeling stunned. After everything that had happened, they were supposed to be one big happy family. Phoebe was supposed to grow up with that, just as she herself had. \"So,\" Jaffa continued, \"I'm gonna explore a little bit, see where I fit in with things.\" \"But you fit in here, with us,\" Ella whispered. Jaffa whined, realising that despite his intentions, we'd wounded his old friend. \"I know… but I feel like I've got to do this. It doesn't mean I'm gone for good, 'cause I'll always come home. I'm not going to stop being your friend just because I'm away a lot of the time.\" He gave Ella a playful nudge. \"Come on, I'm not gone yet. Let's go play chase in the park- maybe scare some dumb old pigeons. What do you say?\" Ella looked down at the pile of trash. She supposed she could forage for the baby later; Phoebe wasn't going anywhere, but Jaffa was. \"Okay,\" she said, with the crooked smile of someone not fully convinced. \"I guess I'd better make the most of having you here to play with.\" She sighed, and pulled herself together. Jaffa was a young adult, and striking out on his own seemed to be a rite of passage he needed to go through. \"Any idea where you'll go first? Or are you just gonna wander round and see where you end up?\" Relieved that Ella was taking the news better, Jaffa began walking, a gentle wag to his tail. \"I've not really spent much time around Queens,\" he replied, \"figured I could start round there, and explore some of Long Island.\" He felt better as Ella trotted by his side. Knowing how much she loved to follow him around like a shadow, it was she whom he'd dreaded telling the most. She was upset, but understood. Jaffa had a feeling that when she was older, Ella would be eager to go exploring with him- and maybe Daisy would tag along for the ride too. All Ella could do was ignore the ache in her chest and make the most of the time she had. Jaffa didn't know quite how she felt about him- and it was better that way- but it was something that had been growing since she'd hit adolescence. It was childish, she knew; her saw her as a little cousin, and that would never change. Perhaps, she wondered, this was all for the best. If Jaffa was not so close, her feelings might just be spared down the track. Still feeling glum after fare-welling Jaffa, Ella dutifully chewed up the remains of the burger she found to make it easier for her baby sister to eat. She knew that sulking would get her nowhere, and tried to keep her mind on the task at hand; to be a supportive presence to her mother and sister. Dash came in the room and smiled in surprise. \"El, you don't need to do that,\" she said, \"it's not your job to feed Phoebe.\" \"I want to,\" said Ella resolutely. \"One less job for you and Dad to do, and it will help her get to know me.\" \"You're a sweet one, my girl.\" In the den, Phoebe was already being entertained, with Daisy blowing raspberries on her belly and pulling faces. The little pup looked up at her older sister and giggled. \"Dinner time, Pheebs!\" called Ella brightly, but her announcement landed on deaf ears. Phoebe was already jumping around, trying to nip Daisy's ears. Undeterred, Ella nudged the mashed burger forward. \"You'll like this, I promise.\" Daisy peeled the squirming puppy off her shoulder, and pointed her towards Ella. \"Grubs up, kid!\" Oblivious to what was being offered, Phoebe continued to struggle, wanting to go back to Daisy. \"Day-Day-Day\" she babbled, turning from Ella and the gift of food. \"We can play later,\" Daisy said, shaking her head. She wasn't blind to the fact that Ella craved a close relationship with their youngest sibling, and was more than happy to share the fun. Phoebe, however, wasn't interested. She whimpered as Ella picked her up, moving her away from the distraction. She wouldn't sniff the meat, nor, upsettingly, would she as much as make eye contact with Ella, whose cheery smile was fading fast. In desperation, Ella pulled faces, as Daisy had, she tried to tickle the pup under her chin, she pulled her up to her chest for a cuddle, and she waggled her ears enticingly, but still Phoebe grumbled, constantly struggling to get back to Daisy. Finally, Dash intervened. \"Honey, I don't think she's hungry right now. Maybe try her later?\" \"Can I try?\" asked Daisy, as Phoebe took the opportunity to toddle right back to her. Ella could only look on as Phoebe happily took food from their other sister, with not a whine nor a whimper, and the whole time gazing up at Daisy with what looked to her like adoration. It stung. She looked away. \"Everything's all new to her,\" said Dash reassuringly, as Ella walked away, \"she'll get the hang of it soon enough. You've got all the fun to look forward to.\" It seemed to Ella that Phoebe already knew all about playing, eating and cuddling… she had Daisy for that. She nodded, appreciating her mother's words, even if they held no weight. Her tail hung low to match her mood as she plodded up the stairs. With her grandmother no longer in her favourite window seat, Ella pulled herself up and watched the world go by as she reflected. None of this had been at all what she'd imagined. Was this how it would be from now on? She, Ella, pushed out as everyone else found happiness elsewhere? Daisy and Phoebe would be the new sister pair, only encumbered by her presence as a third wheel; Jack would pal around with Cocoa and Lucky; and Jaffa, the dog who always made Ella happiest, would be far, far away, going on adventures with no need or want of an immature she-pup as a sidekick. She huffed. This blew. In nearby Saint Mary's Park, Rita, Willow and Storm were enjoying a relaxing afternoon together. That the old dog was wounded had initially put Rita on edge, and she readied herself to defend him if necessary, but all was peaceful and quiet. They strolled beneath the trees, content just to have one another; Rita was not even certain the last time they'd had quality time with just the three of them, but she did know that had been far too long since. The trio stopped to drink from a cool puddle, and Storm, once more, sprawled onto his belly. \"Maybe this is far enough,\" said Rita, concerned. Of course, Storm would only reassure her again and again not to worry, but she sensed something in him was different today. She didn't understand it, but his demeanour was strange. Coupled with his injury, it was enough to stir up her protective feelings towards her beloved father. He, after all, had never let her down when she was vulnerable. \"When did you become such an old woman?\" Storm chuckled. \"You two have a good run around; I'll just kick back and watch.\" Rita wanted to run and play, and wished that her father was strong enough to join them, but she was certainly up for trying to find Willow's fun side. Contented she might be, but the idea of frolicking in the park was pushing Willow beyond her limits. \" No ,\" she said firmly, while Storm laughed. Taking up the challenge, Rita crouched into a bouncing play bow. Ignoring her sister's scowl, she jumped and prodded at her with her paws. \"Rita, act your age,\" Willow sniffed, but she couldn't help but notice the amusement on her father's face. If it made him happy, perhaps she could oblige, just this once. She lurched forward and nipped at Rita's ear. Before long, they were racing up and down the field, their hot breath showing in the evening air as they panted. They jumped and sparred, with Rita staying just one step ahead with every twist and turn. Storm wheezed as he watched, but was satisfied to see 'his girls' close and happy with one another. He reflected on the journey they'd taken to get there; when he first encountered Rita, they'd both believed the young Willow to be dead. Feelings had been deeply hurt, and it had taken many months after their reunion for Rita and Willow to rebuild the bond they'd lost. For Storm, reaching Willow had taken years. She'd been prickly, mistrustful, happy to throw onto him the blame for her suffering that she'd previously heaped on Rita. It hadn't been an easy weight to bear, but he was at least grateful to see the relationship between the two sisters heal. When Storm finally earned Willow's trust and love, it gave him a satisfaction that nothing else could compare to. He'd finally righted the wrongs of his youth, and he could begin to be the father he wished he'd been. Storm felt fortunate, more fortunate than he could put words to. That the three of them had come through, had come so far, was near miraculous. To no-one's surprise, Willow had her fill of frivolity before Rita tired. The younger sister collapsed in a heap beside her father, admitting defeat. She looked over his wound once more. It worried her. On a young dog it would heal in no time, but Storm was no young dog. A part of her wondered if it would scar him for the rest of his days. Rita's soft, dark eyes also scanned over Storm's shoulder, but she said nothing. It was clear what he wanted of this rare time together, and it wasn't for them to fretting over him. \"Is Princess nearby?\" she asked instead, speaking of Storm's present mate. Like her own mother had been, she was a saluki- there was no doubt that the old dog had a type when it came to the ladies. Storm stretched out, grumbling a little with discomfort as his bones ached. \"I honestly don't know,\" he said. \"It's a few weeks since I've seen her, but I figured we'd cross paths sooner or later. We always do.\" Like many street dogs, most of his wanderings were solo, despite his deep affection for his few close friends. Princess held a similar temperament, and they were a great fit. \"I would have wanted to see her… I mean, by now. But it's good to be with you two. It's enough.\" Once again, Rita sensed something from her father, something more than he was letting on. She looked into his tired eyes, meeting his gaze. Then she knew. His eyes searched hers, and then there was no doubt that each understood the other. Rita broke away, taking a moment to right herself while Willow quizzed Storm about Princess. The sun set below the horizon, painting a soft purple glow over the park. The three dogs lay so their sides touched, giving warmth and loving contact, Storm sandwiched between his daughters. He rested his head in his forepaws and exhaled. His eyes closed, he listened to the chirrups of the birds in the trees' bare branches. Rita lay down her head across his shoulder, and Willow, in an unusually demonstrative show of affection did the same from the opposing direction. \"This could be the last time the three of us are all together,\" Willow said, solemnly. She wasn't a fool; she knew that her father was old and that the street life was tough. One day, she'd wake up and realise that he'd been away too long, that he was never coming back. Rita felt a tear form, and struggled to hold it back. This wasn't the time for tears. Storm opened his eyes a little, glancing back over his shoulders to see his daughters with him. \"Stay here tonight?\" he asked softly. Neither said a word, but Willow huddled in closer and Rita brushed away her tear against his ragged, dusty coat. Night would fall upon them as a united family, a family that had come through together despite all odds. Morning came. Rita slowly opened her eyes, feeling the chill of a day barely touched by the sun. No longer was the soft pressure of her father's form beside her keeping her warm, and before she looked, she knew. She'd known before she'd laid down with him that it would be this way, but still it was so hard to face. Rita lifted her head, and lovingly nuzzled Storm's still face. There was no twitch, no flicker, no rise or fall of his chest. He appeared peaceful, in repose, and yet the essence of him was gone. Rita squeezed her eyes shut as tears began to fall, and rested her head back down on her father's back, just as she'd done when she'd been a half-grown pup. Willow, sleeping contentedly as an infant, knew nothing of their loss, and her shattered elder sister couldn't bear to wake her to the pain. So Rita just took in the feel of the three of them together, one last time, though already what they'd had was lost.[Chapter 5] Storm's passing left Rita bereft, and Willow perhaps even more so. He was an old dog- not only that, but an old street dog- and old dogs died. But Willow was fixated on the injustice of it all, and the gut-wrenching knowledge that he was injured in her defence. Storm wasn't strong, quite the opposite, but she remained convinced that had it not been for the vicious and unprovoked attack from those rogue pets, he would have woken that morning. When they returned home, devastated, to impart the sad news, it was with seething anger that Willow spoke of her father's death. He'd harmed no one, and yet he'd been cruelly taken from her. It was more than she could bear. Upon hearing the news, Dash immediately burst into tears, and took comfort in a warm embrace from Sunny and a confused Phoebe. Tito and Luna took Willow's lead, flaring up with outrage and venting their fury over what they saw as no less than murder. Dodger, in contrast was quiet, his focus solely on Rita, who he knew would be hurting most of all. He'd always respected Storm, a dog he'd looked up to as an intelligent and wily character- and as someone who cared deeply for Rita. He had no words to make this any easier for her, though he wished that he'd somehow find some. Instead, he just nuzzled up close to her and let her cry on his shoulder. Word travelled quickly, and in no time at all, the rest of Dash's gang was gathered in the backyard and, led by an incensed Cocoa, baying for blood. The anger that now hung over the place was repugnant to Rita… it was no way to mourn the passing of such a fine, good-hearted dog. She retreated to the closet, burrowed into a pile of blankets. Ella, who herself had been feeling low, found her own worries suddenly thrown into perspective. She climbed the stairs, listening to make sure she wasn't to walk in on her grandmother crying. The door creaked as she nudged it open. \"Grandma Rita? Is it all right if I sit with you?\" she asked, tentatively. Rita shook her ears, righting herself, and edged over. She gave her grandpup a warm smile. Ella, like her mother, Dash, had a great sensitivity to seeking out those who needed a friend. Slowly, Ella came forward. \"I'm sorry about your dad. I didn't know him well, but he seemed like a really great dog.\" Rita lovingly nuzzled her granddaughter's face. \"He was the very best. I'm grateful, you know. I didn't think I'd get a chance to say goodbye. I'm lucky to have known him for so long.\" But that, thought Ella, must only make the final parting even harder. Rita was ten whole years old… Ella couldn't imagine how many memories she and her father must have shared. Not knowing what to say, she simply snuggled in close. Meanwhile, Dodger, Dash and Sunny tried to put out the flames that were erupting in the backyard. The sight of Willow distraught and weeping had sparked a fierceness in Jellybean rarely seen. Whoever responsible for Storm's death had to be brought to justice. \"They weren't far from here, man- Wil said so!\" Tito yapped, his eyes alight. \"We'll track those psychos down no problem with Sunny on the case.\" Sunny growled a low growl, uncomfortable with being dragged into what sounded to him like a recipe for disaster. \"I'm upset as you, but I can't risk getting dogs like that on my tail. I've got a month-old puppy to think about, here!\" His words had the intended effect, as several of the would-be avengers quietened, suddenly realising that thoughtless action could place the entire extended family in jeopardy. Daisy lay down, a look of shame on her face- how could she have even thought of putting Phoebe in harm's way? Cocoa just snorted. \"You're just making excuses, typical cowardly country bumpkin,\" he said, cockily. He knew Jack would not appreciate his talking to his father like that, but he had a point to make, and he was going to make it. \"There were only two of them, and between us we can more than handle that. There won't be anyone left to come after us- any of us. The quicker those guys are shown what happens when they mess with street dogs, the better.\" Lucky looked up to his much-larger friend in admiration. Cocoa was the bravest dog he knew, and he'd proudly follow him into battle against these vicious pets. \"Hear, hear!\" he barked, jumping on the spot. Pulling herself together, Willow approached Dash. \"I want these dogs to pay for what they did,\" she said, \"but something doesn't feel right. They didn't act like any pets I'd ever seen… they were so focused on attacking. We need to protect ourselves, but if we make enemies out of those dogs, it'll only be a matter of time before someone else gets k-….\" Dash nodded. \"I feel the same,\" she said, ignoring the sounds of complaint coming from Cocoa and Lucky. \"For the time being, we need to just keep our wits about us, try and find out who these dogs are. If we're lucky, they might just have been a pair of runaways that'll already have been picked up by the dog catcher. We're not going after anyone until we know more… there's too much at stake.\" She turned to Cocoa, her expression uncharacteristically hard. \"Throwing insults around won't get you your own way. I expected better from you.\" The young dog recoiled a little. He respected Dash, both as a leader and as an aunt-figure; if he'd gone far enough to overstep the mark with her, he knew it was too far. More and more, he realised that her way of being was one he didn't share- she spent too much time thinking and not enough time acting. Cocoa knew his place though; while he lived with Dash's gang, he had to let her make the final judgement… even if it went against his. He felt a twang of regret; trying to humiliate Sunny would do little to make the elder dogs see that he was mature enough to play a larger role in decision making. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, his head lowered, \"I got carried away.\" Cocoa sheepishly exchanged a glance with Sunny, who shook himself, releasing all tension. \"Water under the bridge,\" said the hound. \"You don't have pups; you can't understand what you don't know. You talk to a lot of dogs though- you and Lucky. If these really are dangerous dogs, it's unlikely we're the only ones to know about them.\" Lucky stood up eagerly on his hind legs, thrilled to be involved. \"Leave the sleuthing to us, old man!\" From beside his friends, young Jack piped up, \"Me too- right?\" Dash, still with a stern expression- a reflection of her tiredness and grief, nodded slowly. \"Asking around is the best thing you can do right now. We all need to stay safe. We've gotta look out for each-other, and if there's really a threat, we've got to know everything we can before we try any crazy stunts.\" His head cocked, Lucky studied Dash, realising that she was taking the death in the family hard. He'd known loss himself, and felt for her. Before jumping up onto his familiar perch on Cocoa's broad back, he said, \"I'm sorry about your grandpa, boss. Maybe you should go and rest indoors with your mama?\" Jack nodded. \"You don't need to worry about us; we're staying out of trouble.\" He ran forward to lick his mother's face. Klaus and Jellybean exchanged nuzzles and words of comfort with Dash, and Willow as well, before heading off on their way. Willow glanced back towards the house, wistful. Her sister was in there, and by her side was the only place she really wanted to be. Instead, though, she followed her daughter through the gap in the fence, unwilling to be left alone and distraught in the yard. Away from most of the family, Rita slept curled up in the closet with a concerned Ella staying close. She woke to find Willow, the person she most wanted to be with, had left along with the bulk of Dash's motley crew. Giving a soft whine, she retreated to the front room, where Ella had joined her parents, sisters, and the rest of Dodger's gang. Tito approached slowly, his ears lowered. \"Hey, you doin' all right, chica? You been up there a long time.\" Luna's face was also filled with concern. \"I brought you some food, so you don't have to go out if you don't want,\" she said. \"I know rats and pigeons aren't your thing, so you're in lucky- I managed to snag a burrito.\" Wagging her tail slowly, Rita appreciated the care of her family. \"Thanks, guys. I'm fine, I just feel a bit wiped out right now. I might take you up on that burrito a bit later though.\" \"Anythin' ya need, babe, we're here,\" said Dodger, rubbing against her side as he walked by. \"Best spot on the couch, pick of the TV, first dibs on the best pickin's, all yours.\" \"And cuddles with Pheebs on tap!\" Dash added, as the pup fidgeted between her paws. \"I know we can't make it all better- no one can- but we're here, and we love you.\" Rita smiled warmly. The ache inside didn't lessen, nor did she expect it to- that would take time, but her family surrounded her like a tender embrace, another feeling she could focus on and hold onto. If only, she couldn't help but think, if only Willow could feel the same. She sprawled out on the rug, Dodger and Dash on either side, and let herself take distraction in her four granddaughters, who quickly began to laugh and play. Storm had been a most wonderful grandparent, taking Lily under his wing and helping her on her way. He'd spent most of his life alone, but somehow, he'd managed to make those close to him feel as though he was their whole world. If Rita learned anything from her father, it was that you had to cherish the time you had with the ones you loved, for so often it wasn't enough. Dash, Sunny, and the girls would not be here for long, and she was determined not to let her grief get in the way of being the grandparent she really wanted to be… someone they could count on. The youngsters tumbled about on the carpet, taking relief from the sombre atmosphere that had followed Jaffa's departure from Dash's gang, and now the passing of their great-grandfather. Little Phoebe knew nothing of the emotional upheavals her playmates were experiencing, life was still an adventure and a game to her. She fell on her face as she rushed to follow her beloved Daisy, and it made her shriek with laughter all the more. Once again, Ella was left out in the cold, her desperation for the infant's affections only driving her toward the other sister. Sensing Ella's upset, Daisy turned her attention away from Phoebe, and back to the sister who had always been her best friend and partner in crime. She pulled at Ella's ear, dragging her into a playful tussle. Soon, both girls were belly laughing, and Phoebe crawling over them, desperate to join in the fun. With Ella more relaxed, the small pup found her to be almost as much fun as Daisy- though there was still no doubt who her favourite sister was. Even as the girls played, Rita found herself glancing intermittently out the window, searching for any sign that Willow was returning home. Luna cocked her head. \"Are you sure you're all right? You don't think those dogs might have followed Willow's scent to here, do you? \"No way. I've said it before, I don't want to talk about any of that,\" Rita spoke firmly, putting her paw down. \"That kind of talk is only gonna make this harder for Willow. You know she thinks it's her fault he died?\" Luna faltered and looked down. \"I… I didn't know. I'm sorry.\" Rita nuzzled Luna's face. \"If nothing had happened, he'd have died all the same. He was happy, and that's what matters. That's what Will needs to know.\" Dash nodded solemnly. \"That's how Grandpa would have wanted it.\" She leaned against her mother, offering her utmost solidarity. Night fell on a quiet house. Rita retired upstairs early, and Dash's brood gave her space. Tito and Luna had only just come home from an afternoon of gallivanting, and were settling down as Fagin prepared himself for bed. As Fagin entered the room, a renewed spark of energy flared; he had that effect on the dogs, even after all those years. Rita held back, sadness creeping over her as she watched Dodger, Tito and Luna roll around on the bed while Fagin tried to get beneath the covers. Everything went on as normal, but she was aching and hollow, a part of her that had been there almost as long as she could remember, gone. Dodger paused, catching his mate's eye and quietening. Noticing the hesitation, Fagin looked to Rita. \"You're not yourself today, hey, girl?\" Dutifully, Rita wandered over, offering her master a lick. She hadn't realised just how tired she was; holding it together was taking its toll. Appreciating Fagin's concern and petting, she nonetheless headed to her usual spot, where she knew Dodger would join her. Soon wrapped in the embrace of her closest friend, Rita closed her eyes. She'd take it one day at a time, but for now, it was far to raw for her mind to wander far from Storm. For hours she tossed and turned, waking a tolerant Dodger twice, and falling back to sleep as he licked her shoulder. Muffled sounds of Dash's brood downstairs drifted up every now and then- no doubt they were still disturbed during the night by the young pup. The stairs creaked, but Rita was at last fast asleep, and she wouldn't be so easily woken. A pale, slender face pushed the door ajar. Willow peered in, her body tense and shaking. Her wide eyes fell on Fagin's form, and for a moment, she recoiled in fear. Pulling herself together, she searched desperately for Rita, knowing that if she didn't get to her side quickly, her nerve would fail her. And there she was, huddled up in the cave-like closet, comfortable in a bed of blankets. Willow surged forward, praying she could get to her sister without waking that human. She perched awkwardly in the small space behind Rita and tried to curl up. Rita stirred, confused by the feeling of something moving beside her- she knew it wasn't Dodger. She looked around, and there was Willow. The gasp could not be contained, nor could the tears that fell freely. Rita entwined herself with her little sister and they cried together. \"It's gonna be okay, Will,\" Rita whispered, \"we'll just ride this one out together.\" Willow coughed, feeling all at once like a scared and vulnerable pup. \"You promise?\" Rita glanced to Dodger, who got over his shock quickly and moved to the foot of Fagin's bed to give the sisters space. \"Absotively posilutely. Just close your eyes; we can take it one night at a time.\" She could tell that Willow was exhausted, so tired she no longer made the effort to nervously listen for Fagin's every slight movement. Willow rested her weary eyes and burrowed her head against Rita's chest. Just as she had known that her father was drawing his last breaths, Rita knew now that a change had come in her younger sister. From now and forever, Willow would truly be a part of the gang; where Rita had always known she'd belonged. Enveloped in a deep comfort, one like nothing she'd known since she was a puppy, Willow knew it too. Here on in, she was facing her fears.[Chapter 6] A lithe brown dog stretched out, his gaze shifting to a tidy house on the opposing side of the street. He was waiting, knowing that his brother would be sneaking out soon. His mate, a blue-grey corgi mix shifted beside him restlessly. \"Chill out, Pep,\" said Bandit casually, \"it won't be long now. That kid's gotta run off to school at some point.\" Pepper snapped out a frustrated yawn. Life was too short to be wasted waiting around. She had enough of that with her perpetually laidback mate. For Bandit, she would tolerate just about anything, but keeping watch for his human-licking pet brother was horribly tedious. That aside, she liked Nicky. He wasn't a patch on his older brother- not in her eyes anyway- but he knew how to have a good time once he was dragged away from the house. More often than not, he'd have his two now-grown pups along for the ride as well. His mate, a refined whippet named Nina, preferred her home comforts, but Feather and Cloud could always be counted on to follow their father into the action. It was Feather, the young bitch with delicate features and a soft golden coat who appeared first, her tail immediately wagging in wild circles as she glimpsed Bandit and Pepper in the bushes. Unable to contain herself, Pepper jumped up, loudly yapping a greeting. Bandit gave a low howl, a 'hello'. Nicky followed after his daughter, while the timid Cloud, grey and spindly, brought up the rear- as he always did. They ran across the road, taking no heed of the car that blasted its horn as they darted into its path. Raised by Dodger himself, Nicky knew what he was doing, and had no fear of city traffic. Cloud and Feather, in turn, were fast becoming expert street dogs as well- in spite of the comfortable home they shared their time with. Bandit loped towards Nicky, and affectionately nibbled his ear. \"Good night, bro?\" \"Soph took us to the park at sundown. Place was crawlin' with dogs, wicked fun.\" Nicky wagged his tail. \"If you're still hangin' around these parts you should come with us tonight, I bet Pepper would be the life of the party.\" Pepper beamed. Being the life of the party was what she did best. \"I'll keep that in mind,\" said Bandit, \"but I guess it'll depend on how things are at Fagin's. You know, how Mom's doin'. They're not goin' anywhere, but we've got way too much catchin' up to do.\" His ears flicked back in shame. \"I'm not sure how Dash is gonna be… she's gotta be hurt that I haven't even seen her new pup yet. It's not like I didn't know she and Sunny were probably gonna have another litter.\" Nicky tossed his ears, unconcerned. \"Honestly, Brat, I reckon she's been to busy to waste time worryin' about stupid stuff like that. She'll be happy to see ya.\" Needing no more reassurance that all would be well, Bandit playfully nipped at Feather's side, inviting her to play. \"So, who's up for breakfast? I wanna see if Miss Feather's bagel snatchin' game is as good as her daddy says it is!\" Feather jumped forward, snapping her jaws as Pepper bounced in a play bow before her. They tangled together and ran off into the streets. With his young human, Sophie out of the way, Nicky switched personas, becoming a wily street dog, and his daughter was more than happy to take the opportunity to rebel against the boring pet life. It felt good for Bandit to be back in familiar territory, the streets near to the bulk of his family, a part of the city he'd regularly frequented in days past. He and Pepper were wanderers by nature, with favourite haunts dotted around; from Coney Island, where they'd first begun their life together, to Brighton Beach, below the bridge over Astoria Park, and here, moving up into the lower Bronx, where his parents and youngest sister were waiting for him. More than anywhere else, it felt like home. Nowhere else could he rest, safe from the challenges of the harsh street life, and surrounded by dogs who'd greet him with wagging tails. He'd had his reasons for keeping his distance, and even now, desperate as he was to envelope himself back into the fold, he knew he'd made the right choice. It was a sacrifice for Pepper, and for her, he'd do anything. Oblivious to the butterflies forming in Bandit's stomach as they approached Fagin's run-down home, Feather and Cloud had goaded the hot-headed Pepper into a chase through the slow-moving traffic, and squealed as she charged after them. Nicky knew his brother better than his pups did. \"So, are you gonna tell me what's kept you two away for so long? Like I said, no one's gonna be on your back 'bout it, but is everythin' all right, man? Don't tell anyone, but I was startin' to worry.\" Bandit gave an anxious yawn. He wasn't ready to talk about his problems; he'd come home to forget about them, to go back to being the carefree loafer he'd been before things changed. He glanced across the way to where Pepper was tussling with Feather. \"It's personal,\" was all he could reply. For now, at least, he was moving on and getting his own spark back. He brightened up, focussing on the thought of seeing the faces of his parents, uncle, aunt, cousins and friends again. \"Never again though, I've missed all you guys.\" The street below Fagin's bedroom window echoed with playful barking as his five canine companions- though 'companion' was still a bit strong a description for his relationship with Willow- and Dash's clan gambolled around, welcoming the new day. Fagin chuckled as Phoebe, now seven weeks old and full of beans, tugged at the bottoms of his pants. \"Get off! Off- off !\" Fagin spluttered, shaking his leg in a futile attempt to dislodge the naughty pup. Crossing his arms in feigned annoyance, he turned his head to give a stern look to Dodger and Dash, who were watching beside his scooter. \"I hope you're proud of your child-rearing skills, little lady- and you too, Grandpa ! She's a monkey, this one.\" Dodger grinned proudly. Pheebs was a chip off the old block, all right. Almost too much so; precocious as she was, Dash would soon be ready to take her home to the alley where the rest of the family waited. He'd miss that little imp, and Dash, Sunny, Daisy and Ella too, but they'd never be far away. Goodbyes used to trouble Dodger, but these days, he found it easier to let people go. He was totally secure in his position as centre of his growing extended family. Besides, with less dogs around, it wouldn't be long before the cats, Oliver and Evie, took up residence again. Dodger need never be lonely. Playfully sparring with her granddaughters, Luna, Daisy and Ella on top of a parked car, Rita was happy. She had her moments, of course, when she felt down, but she knew from deep within that everything had happened as it was meant to, and that this new era in her life would be a positive one. There were still whispers amongst the dogs, and Rita was aware of it, about the circumstances of Storm's passing, which had been re-ignited by recent rumours of attacks on street dogs. She simply shrugged it off and pretended she didn't hear. With Phoebe growing every day, it was impossible to sit and mope anyway; that kid got into everything. How Rita would feel when Dash's clan moved on, she wasn't sure, but she wouldn't waste what time she had with them worrying about that. Having finally pulled the wriggling pup from his leg, Fagin whistled the dogs over, and they piled awkwardly into the back of the scooter. As always, Willow held back with Dash, Sunny and the kids, her head lowered in mistrust. \"Later, guys!\" Dodger called as Fagin put his foot on the gas. He had not a worry, nor a care. An old dog now, some things never changed. Cold December winds blew against the dogs' faces as the scooter careened down the streets, leaving Tito's teeth chattering and Luna shivering. Rita huddled against Dodger, taking the warmth of his back against her belly. They screeched to a halt at a red light, and Dodger's eye was caught by the vision of an athletic brown dog, effortlessly loping through the cars across the way. He gave a high-pitched yelp, unable to contain himself. It had been many months since he'd seen his eldest son, his Bandit. Rita, Tito and Luna snapped their heads around to see what had caught their leader's attention, but the mutt had already leapt from the basket and was bounding over to greet his boy. Following the dog who'd seemingly dissolved into a brown blur, Dodger ran into a bright alleyway, only to be surrounded. His youngest, Nicky, two eldest grandpups, Feather and Cloud, and Bandit's wild-hearted mate, Pepper milled around him, howling in mirth. Family reunions around here were rarely quiet. As Bandit dropped a bagel at his paws and turned around, the warmest of smiles lit his visage. \"Hey, old man! It's been too long, hey?\" Dodger bumped his forehead against Bandit's, greeting him with a broad grin on his own face. \"Too long? Brat, I thought ya'd fallen off the edge a' the earth or somethin'!\" Bandit's smile became sheepish, but he recovered quickly. \"I'm a big boy, papa, can't hang around my folks all the time.\" \"Try tellin that to ya…\" \" Bandit! \" Rita howled, and she flew down the alley, her paws barely touching the ground as she flung herself forward. His eyes squinting with barely contained joy, Bandit bounced in circles around his mother, feeding off the love that was radiating off her. \"I'm home! I'm home!\" was all he could say. Rita lay her head over her son's shoulder and held him close. \"About time! You shouldn't be away so long, it's been killin' me!\" For most of his four years, Bandit had never strayed from the vicinity of the gang for long; Fagin said he and Pepper hung around like a bad smell. It had been far too long now, and Rita had missed her firstborn. \"Easy there, Mama-dearest,\" Pepper quipped, \"A few months? Tha's nothin'. You're gettin' clingy in your old age.\" \"Maybe, but at least you're charmin' as ever.\" Rita wagged her tail, and smiled at her son's mate. She and Pepper clashed frequently when in close proximity, but beneath it all, each thought very highly of the other. Bandit grinned; it felt like they'd never been away from the gang. All that remained now was perhaps the greatest emotional challenge; reuniting with Dash and meeting the new puppy. How Pepper would handle it, Bandit didn't quite know. The newcomers were led by an excited band back to Fagin's place, where Dash would be supervising the growing and cheeky Phoebe. Bandit felt a swoop of nerves as he looked up to the shabby little house. He expected his younger sister's feelings to be hurt by his absence, and knew that the sight of her with a new daughter would simultaneously be hard for Pepper to swallow. He was Bandit though, carefree and easy-going. He could handle this, no problem. Phoebe ran out, squealing, into the backyard as she heard the approach of the group of dogs. Barely batting an eyelid at the presence of two strangers, she gambolled around her cousins, Cloud and Feather, whom she knew from experience to be excellent fun. Bandit felt a knot in his stomach as he watched her. The little one was such a joy, and he was missing that. He looked up from her antics, and met the eye of Dash, who'd followed her pup outside. \"Bandit,\" Dash breathed, her face full of emotion. \"I'd been worried about you!\" Bandit wagged his tail sheepishly. \"I'm sorry. I had a good reason for being away so long, I promise. Never again, okay?\" \"Never. I missed you too much- and so much has happened! Bratty, meet Phoebe,\" she looked proudly down to her youngest daughter. \"Pheebs, this is your Uncle B.\" Phoebe sniffed at Bandit's paws. \"Uncle B? Bandit. You're Mom's big brother?\" \"That's right. Pleasure to meet you, Phoebe.\" He leant down and the pup clambered over his head. Immediately, he felt a surge of love for his niece. She had Dash's eyes, and Sunny's easy confidence in making friends. If he'd totally missed out on being a part of her childhood, he'd never have forgiven himself; they'd missed too much as it was. Dash eyed Bandit suspiciously. Something didn't seem quite right about him. \"It's going to be so good to have you around again. The kids have missed their favourite pup-sitter,\" she paused, nudging Phoebe back towards her cousins. \"Are you sure you're okay? You look a little… I don't know… almost sad?\" Bandit winced, wishing he was better at hiding his inner turmoil. \"I'm all right. It's just been a rough few months, that's all. We can have a real talk sometime; you've always been a good listener. Besides, I've got no business mopin' after the time you've had. I'm so sorry 'bout your pups, Dash.\" \"It hurt like hell. But we got Phoebe out of all of it. I wouldn't change anything. Hopefully things will get better for you too.\" Dash looked over her shoulder to keep an eye on her young daughter, who was growling dramatically as she hung off a laughing Pepper's ear while Feather egged her on. \"Anytime you want to talk, you know you can count on me.\" She gave her brother a lick on the cheek. \"We're actually moving back to the alley tomorrow, so if you want to hang round here it won't be so crowded. It's gonna be weird… I'm pretty sure Cocoa's gotten used to running the show.\" Bandit laughed, feeling much better having seen Pepper relaxed and happy, despite his worries for her. \"They'll be so happy to have ya home. Cocoa too; he thinks a lot of ya.\" \"He does. Sweet guy really; I think it's been tough for him since Jaffa left home. I miss Jack like hell, but I'm glad he's been such a great friend to him.\" \"Man, you go away for, what? Half a year? -And everythin's changed!\" \"That's what happens, Brat. That'll teach you not to run away for so long.\" Surrounded by family and free to roam and play in the cold streets, the day rolled by quickly for an increasingly contented Bandit. Despite his earlier words, nothing had really changed at all. Showers of rain left the rampaging dogs shaking cold droplets from their coats, but their spirits could not be dampened. Nicky's clan, as was always the way, could not stay long, but the others relished their freedom, skidding and sliding through the traffic with joyous ease. Bandit loped alongside Dash, who was giving her little Phoebe her first taste of the street life, all in preparation for the move they'd be making when the next day came. He stayed just close enough that he could nudge the pup back to the safety of her mother if she strayed too near to the edge. Seeing the wonder in the kid's eyes warmed his heart, remembering when he himself had first been introduced to this magical world, these streets of gold. Before long, though, Sunny had taken his place, and Phoebe's face lit up at the sight of her father. Coming back to earth with a bump, Bandit righted himself quickly, taking off after his own parents, who were bounding through the streets wildly. Like a dark, furry streak, Bandit flew across the traffic, and soon felt Pepper running by his side. He howled, and all around him, the voices of those he loved howled back. Catching up with his parents, Bandit jumped at Dodger, and they tumbled onto the pavement, laughing and snapping at tails and ears. Rita and Pepper both joined the tangle, with Luna and Tito a little way behind. Rita howled again, letting go of her recent heartache and losing herself to the connectedness she now felt with her family. Falling to the cold, wet cement, Bandit caught her eyes and smiled as she came forward to nuzzle his dripping face. All the while, Pepper continued to pounce at Tito in a wild frenzy, truly letting loose for the first time in many months. They were home. Leaving Pepper to blow off some steam, Bandit took a walk with his mother. He wanted to tell her, knowing she'd want to be there for him, but he couldn't bring himself to ruin the best time he'd had in so, so long. She wouldn't be going anywhere, after all. Rita's tail just couldn't stop wagging. She'd missed him so, more than she could say. Somehow, seeing her firstborn son's face once more made it seem as though everything would be all right. \"You're looking well, Ban; I'm glad you've been eating well. I know I shouldn't worry, but I guess that's what moms are for.\" \"I guess so. But you know I'll always come home. It must have been hard, you know, with Grandpa. I'm happy he was with you and Auntie Will.\" Rita nuzzled him once more. \"He was happy. You can't really ask more than that.\" Looking at her son, she couldn't have been prouder; he was strong and healthy, and he saw the affection in his eyes as he gazed over his family. It baffled her that he'd choose to stay away for so long, it just wasn't him. \"You and Pepper haven't thought about the pitter patter of little paws have you? I've seen how great you are with Phoebe. If you're stickin' around, you'd never be short of help.\" Bandit's breath caught in his throat, and the bottom seemed to fall from his stomach. He couldn't do this now, he was trying to let it all go. \"You know me, responsibility ain't my scene.\" He shook his head, letting the subject drop. It wouldn't leave, rattling around his mind, tormenting him. He barely heard what Rita was saying to him, and he could only cluelessly nod along. When Pepper jumped up on him from behind, growling a loving invitation to play, he was grateful to be given an escape. As night fell, Bandit and Pepper finally parted from the warm family gathering, retreating to Saint Mary's Park, close to Fagin's place but with the privacy Bandit now needed. He'd wanted to stay with the rest of the family, to sleep at Fagin's feet once more, but a sensitive subject had been brought up, and his first priority was caring for Pepper's feelings. It had taken courage for her to agree to come back, knowing that Dash had a young pup in tow. The run of abject failures in producing a litter had broken her heart a little bit more each time, and Bandit knew that the recent futile attempt to fall pregnant had been the hardest hit yet. They'd been desperate, but still, nothing. Bandit missed the carefree days, when all that mattered was him and Pepper, living for the sake of laughing, and letting all worries fall to the wayside. He wanted to be that dog, and he almost was, but there was a piece of him that knew it likely that an inadequacy on his part had led to the hopes and disappointments that had dimmed Pepper's spirit. Bandit worried for her. She was hurt, and she'd lash out, and then retreat to a dark place within when she'd pushed everyone away. On the surface, she was the same bouncy, joyously bull-headed dog she'd always been, but just below was a real danger that her pent-up emotions would boil over. Bandit could only be there for her, and hope that things would change. He didn't need to be a father, but he needed Pepper to be okay. Tenderly, he nuzzled her face. \"Was that okay, Pep?\" he asked, glad that she hadn't heard his mother asking about their family plans. \"I think it'll soon be like we've never been away. I hope so. Like you said… moving on.\" Pepper's ears drooped a little, but she smiled at Bandit. \"Yeah. Maybe someday I won't think about it so much. Maybe someday it won't eat away at me all the time. I think we made the right choice… it's good to be distracted; when it was just the two of us it was hard.\" Bandit settled beside her, disquieted. Would 'just the two of them' ever be the same again? When she was alone with him, Pepper was reminded constantly that when it came down to it, they hadn't been compatible. Did she look at him differently? Bandit knew that he saw himself differently. Snuggling in close, Pepper said goodnight with a sweet lick to Bandit's nose. It was enough, for now at least, to reassure him. He would be there for her, that much he knew.[Chapter 7] Phoebe greeted the new day, as she always did, with a wagging tail and an infectious laugh. The atmosphere around the house was one of bittersweet excitement, as Dash prepared to lead her young daughter home to the alley that she'd grow up in. Rita felt relief, knowing that Dash and Phoebe had been through much to get to this step, but how she'd miss them. She happily let the boisterous pup snap at her tail as she rolled around on the floor. However much she'd miss Dash's clan, their moving on would be best for everyone. There was no denying that Fagin's tiny house felt terribly cramped in the evenings with five extra dogs hanging around, including three energetic pups. Oliver and Evie had been keeping their distance as a result, and they were very much missed, especially by Dodger. Rita had no doubt that Dash's gang- the half of it left behind in the alley- would have found the separation hard, devoted as they were to their leader. They'd be desperate to play a larger role in Phoebe's life, but it meant that the role the pup's grandparents played would be decreased. From Sunny's side, Dash was still yawning. \"It's going to be so strange not to have you guys around… but I am so ready to see Jack every day again.\" She'd had frequent contact with her son while she was away, but it could never be the same. He'd missed out on so much of Phoebe's life, and that was upsetting to Dash. After today, though, they'd be united as a family, and as a gang, the way it always should have been. \"That's gonna be real cool,\" Phoebe said excitedly, accidentally letting her grandmother's waving tail slip through her paws. \"And I can play with Lucky. I've gotta be almost as big as him now, so I won't have to be left behind all the time.\" Dash smiled kindly. The kid wanted to grow up so fast- too fast for her liking. \"One step at a time, honey. One step at a time.\" As Fagin readied himself for a day of work, the front room had filled with dogs, slowly waking up and enjoying what would soon be a rare gathering. Phoebe couldn't imagine anything else; this was her whole life, these light-hearted moments with her family. Her grandfather was always full of stories, and she was never quite sure how much was true and how much was just him trying to impress her. Her grandmother told stories too, meant more to inspire the young pup, building her excitement for the thrilling world she'd soon be entering. Tito was always ready for a scrap, and down on her level, seemed almost like another kid sometimes. Luna tried, and failed, to teach Phoebe to climb trees, but happily cut her losses and became instead a constant playmate, just as she was to Daisy and Ella. Phoebe knew she'd love living with her mother's full gang just as much, but that wouldn't stop her from missing those she'd leave behind. She, Luna, Daisy and Ella tussled over a ball, giving time for the adults to finish all their stretching and yawning. Phoebe wasn't the only one with mixed feelings. It had been a long time, and Dash had started to feel that this place was her home once more. She knew she'd have to shake it, to step back into the role of leader, but she'd so enjoyed being able to focus entirely on her dependent young. The contact that she'd had with her old gang hinted to her that Cocoa, who'd been antsy over the group's temporary split in the first place, had been ill-affected by the disruption to the family he'd always been so protective of- especially since the attack on Willow and Storm. Usually, the mild-mannered Jaffa could be called on to dampen his fiery fighting spirit, but his place in the little clan had been taken by the terrier, Lucky, whose life's purpose seemed to be to egg Cocoa on. It was a worry, and Dash was grateful that her Jack was so highly focused on keeping his older friend out of trouble. How much Jack was an influence on Cocoa and Lucky, and how much the reverse was true, though, she couldn't help but wonder. The dynamic would be very different to the almost idyllic one at Fagin's place, but Dash told herself that she was ready for it, and Phoebe would be to. When the door creaked open and it was time to leave, Phoebe ran forward without hesitation, her doting father hot on her trail. \"I guess this is it, then?\" said Dodger, looking to Dash. It had almost been like old times for a little while. Dash smiled through her jitters. \"I guess so. You guys are gonna get to sleep through the night without Madam over there wakin' everyone up.\" \"Yeah, I'm not gonna miss the three AM wake-up call because someone wants to play.\" \"I'm sorry about that, I guess I'm so done in by night-time that she can sneak right away without me even stirring.\" \"Hey- no worries, Mini. Pheebs is just teachin' us to appreciate sleep, tha's all.\" Dodger grinned. It would be quiet; too quiet, without all the kids around, and it was of utmost relief to him that they'd only be a few blocks away. He needed some activity in his life; he wasn't about to become a slow-paced old man. Not yet. Dash gave her father a nuzzle, appreciating his good-humoured approach to grandparenthood. She knew that her zealous daughter could be a pain in the tail, but there was no doubt that he loved her to pieces. \"I guess I'll see you later then. Drop by some time; maybe tomorrow, once she's a little bit more settled?\" \"We'll be there,\" Dodger said, as Rita joined them for the 'farewell for now'. Thankfully, for Phoebe only had little legs, it was only a short stroll to Dash's alley, and the small pup could happily gambol all the way there without tiring. As with every morning, Daisy and Ella had greeted the day with enthusiasm, and their excitement about finally taking their young sister home only heightened their puppy giddiness. As far as they were concerned, that they were going home was the signal that the stresses of the past months were now over. Jellybean's broad, wrinkled face scrunched up in an emotional beam as her dear friend and cousin came around the corner. Beside her, Klaus barked his deep bark of excitement, and at their paws, Jack squirmed in ill-disguised joy at having his whole family home again. Cocoa was more restrained, aware as he was that he'd no longer be running the show, but Lucky was jumping up and down on his back. Dash couldn't help but grin as she found herself surrounded by the full force of her happy little gang. Licks came at her, Sunny and the girls from all directions, making it quite clear that they were very much welcomed home. For Dash, there was one person she wanted to nuzzle up to most of all, and that was her sweet boy, Jack. The pup snuggled close, dodging the licking tongues of his groupmates, and reaffirming his position in the centre of Dash's clan. \"C'mon,\" said Jack, managing, with difficulty, to pull himself away from the writhing huddle of dogs. \"You haven't seen what we've done out back. You're gonna like it!\" \"What have you done to my place, Jack?\" Dash asked, an eyebrow raised. Jack laughed, nudging Phoebe forward with his paws. \" Come on !\" He led them to the back of the alley, where a rickety wooden fence marked the boundary of their home; to some of the gang anyway. Beyond the fence, the owner of the neighbouring car yard had fenced off a small slice of his property to give the dogs a bolt hole and extra security. The man had appreciated the presence of the dogs, who'd acted as a deterrent to thieves and trespassers in the past, and he'd happily ensured a piece of his place was comfortable for Dash, whom he referred to as 'Miss Scruffy'. Jellybean and Cocoa had never ventured into this den area, mistrustful as they were of their human neighbour, but it had been the perfect place for Dash to raise her first litter, and it'd be home for Phoebe now as well. Dash's eyes widened in surprise. The den area had doubled in size, with the fence having been moved backwards, further into the car yard. One side had been covered by a slanted metal roof, providing much-needed shelter for the winter months. All the nesting materials Ella had arranged prior to Phoebe's birth were still there, beside a new drawer from a chest, which had been filled with various blankets, newspapers, and pillowcases. A truck tyre lay beneath the shelter, and it too had been lined with a thick blanket. \"All right,\" said Jack, \"we had a little help from the man. But it's great, hey? Plenty of room for all of us!\" \"It's amazing, thanks, Jack,\" Dash said, finding herself grinning. It felt like home, and she could see all the love that had gone into making sure she, Sunny and the pups would be comfortable on their return. It meant the world. \"Woah!\" cried Daisy, \"Nice makeover!\" She wasted no time at all in inspecting every nook and cranny of the den, with Phoebe right under her paws. Ella surged forward, prodding the tyre with her paws to test how comfortable it would be as a bed. \"I like it!\" While the kids checked out the den, Dash and Sunny turned back to their dear friends, who they'd missed so much. \"You okay, Dashie?\" Jellybean asked, cocking her head. \"A little overwhelmed. I've built it up in my head; worrying about how I'll cope with keeping Pheebs safe.\" Sunny licked the air in her direction. \"We've done it with three, honey. Our little lady is gonna have babysitters everywhere round here.\" Jellybean nodded. \"We've got this. And I get it; I was crazy overprotective after losing pups too, but that's why you've got us. It'll be my own personal mission to help you chill out.\" \" Ja! \" wuffed Klaus, his stub tail wiggling. \"Se kids have eachosser too. You see, Cocoa and Lucky already try to play.\" Dash watched as Daisy snorted with laughter in response to her big cousin Cocoa pulling at her tail. Already, the kids- and the teenagers- seemed happy and relaxed. It was the way she'd always wanted it, but that didn't stop the irrational voice in her head from whispering doubts. With her three closest friends supporting her decision, she could take her time to get used to being back at the helm. \"Thanks, guys,\" she said, letting her friends put her at ease. \"I think it's gonna just take a little while for me to adjust.\" \"The quicker we get back into the swing of things, the better,\" said Sunny cheerfully. \"How 'bout you lead is on one of your famous breakfast runs?\" Jellybean's eyes twinkled. \"Show Pheebs how it's done!\" \"I think,\" said Dash, her old spark coming back, \"that's a great idea.\" A short way away, Bandit and Pepper were side by side, snuffling through overturned trashcans. While Bandit was itching to get back to his family, he'd figured it best to give everyone some space while Dash's clan were in the process of leaving Fagin's. They'd drop by later… no doubt his parents would appreciate the company with the house suddenly so much emptier. Besides, he'd determined, with the weather cooling at an alarming rate, it would do them well to make sure they were well fed. Delving deeper into the can to avoid the cold wind, Bandit finally caught sight of the morsel that he'd been sniffing for. It wasn't anything exciting, just a piece of bread that had once formed the top of a sandwich, but it was smothered in sauce and still held the scents of the bacon that it had once been pressed against. He pawed it out, and it bounced onto the pavement, catching on the breeze. Stumbling backwards to sink his teeth into his bread, Bandit momentarily looked up, and jumped at the sight of a hulking dog standing behind Pepper. Instinctively, he barked in alarm, causing both Pepper and the stranger- a sandy coloured shepherd with a dark mask over his face- to lift their heads. Pepper leapt up in surprise, hitting her head on the trashcan she'd been snuffling in. The shepherd's stance remained stiff; he looked like a predator stalking his prey, and it frightened Bandit. As Pepper joined Bandit in voicing barked threats to the menacing stranger, he at last retreated, not taking his flashing eyes off the shaking Pepper until he'd backed around the corner. Pepper looked up to Bandit, her jaw hanging low. \"What was with that guy?\" \"Dunno, but he gave me the creeps!\" Bandit murmured, unwilling to look away from the corner he'd seen the shepherd disappear behind. \"Wait… was he wearing a collar? What's a pet doin' down here?\" Shaking herself, Pepper recovered. It had looked like that to her, but why would a pet be skulking around the mean streets… and looking at other dogs in the way she'd look at her dinner? Bandit could sense his mate's unease and looked away from the end of the street so he could give her a reassuring lick. \"We oughtta let Dash know there's a nutter around. It was like he was stalkin' you. The kids gotta be watched.\" \"I guess so. That weirdo won't be a match for Klaus, J.B. and Cocoa. Better for them to be on their guard, though, hey?\" The pair had been sticking to the area between Fagin's place and Dash's alley, and it took no time at all to pick up the scent of one of their friends. Following their noses, Bandit and Pepper soon heard barking and canine laughter on the wind, and they couldn't help but break into a gallop at the sound, drawn irresistibly by the promise of a good time. That they'd almost been jumped by a large and aggressive dog was soon far from their minds. It was Sunny they ran into first, holding back, as he usually did, while the others danced through the traffic. He still had no natural road sense and was much more comfortable watching his beloved family from a distance. \"How's it goin'?\" Bandit called, taking Sunny by surprise. \"Bandit!\" the hound replied, having recovered. \"I didn't see you there. It's goin' great; kids are right into the swing of it. I was never really worried about Pheebs, she takes everythin' in her stride, but it was gonna be big for Dashie.\" \"And she's okay?\" asked Bandit, concerned. Sunny beamed. \"She's perfect. You know how she is, a whole lot braver than she looks. An' she's got her old pals back. It makes a big difference.\" Pepper sat back on her haunches, upright with her forepaws waving. \"Not too crowded back in the old alley?\" \"Nah, just like old times. The little one don't take up much space.\" He looked wistfully out into the streets, willing his mate and pups to come back into view. That he'd never truly overcome his anxiety in traffic felt crippling when the rest of his family had not a care. Dash would return to him, always, when he had to hang back, overwhelmed, but it didn't stop him from wishing he could be as much a street dog as everyone else. They didn't have to wait long to see Dash, who- true to form- had no intentions of keeping her anxious mate out of the family's milestone day. Daisy charged in front of her, barrelling straight into her auntie Pepper with no hesitation, and Phoebe scrambled to keep up. Dash tossed her ears, rearranging her windswept fur. \"Morning, brother dearest. And to what do we owe the pleasure?\" Bandit yawned, presenting a picture of nonchalance. \"Ya know, just in the area. An' wanted to give you guys a heads up 'bout some weird dog that was round this way.\" \"Weird?\" Dash asked, her head cocked. \"In what way? Not dangerous?\" Leaving Pepper to rumble with the kids, Bandit backed around the corner, where he had less sounds to compete with. As Sunny and Dash joined him, he shrugged his shoulders. There had to be a middle ground between putting them on guard and causing excessive alarm, but he wasn't sure how to find it with a protective mother. \"Well, maybe. But the guy was a pet. We were lookin' through some trashcans, an' I looked up an' saw him stalkin' Pepper. Like predatory stuff, like he was gonna pounce on a rat. When I noticed, we barked at him and he backed off, but it was real strange how he was lookin' at us. Sinister even.\" Dash's hackles had raised, and she instinctively glanced around the corner to look over her youngest pup. \"Yeah, that's scary.\" She exchanged a look with Sunny. \"What kinda dog? Not a shepherd?\" Bandit was taken aback. \"Yeah, yeah, a shepherd. Sandy fur and a dark mask. You seen a creepy dog like that?\" \"No,\" said Dash heavily, \"but I think Willow has.\" She hesitated for a moment. \"Did they tell you that Grandpa Storm and Willow were attacked? The day before he died.\" \"What? No- by a dog like that? A pet?\" Bandit shook his head. \"No one said anything about that. Wait- did that dog kill Gramps?\" Dash licked her lips nervously. \"Honestly, we don't know. He was an old dog; Mom says he was dyin' anyway, but Willow thinks it was what did it.\" Bandit was stunned, and suddenly overwhelmed by a swooping sick feeling in his stomach. \"It's a touchy subject,\" said Sunny, \"there were some among us who wanted to hunt the dog down and get even, but thankfully, common sense prevailed.\" \"An', an' that's why no one thought to mention it, right? Scared to stir up trouble?\" Dash nodded. \"Basically, yes. Cocoa, Jack and Lucky have been doing some sniffing around, it sounds like a lot of dogs 'round here have seen this guy- or at least heard about him. The impression we're getting is that he's not acting alone… but they're all pets.\" Bandit flicked his ear, half-listening to the squeals of Pepper and the pups just a around the corner. In his experience, pets were never a threat, constrained as they were by fences and leashes. That this had suddenly become a problem was curious. \"You reckon something organised? If they're all linked to the same dog?\" 'Perhaps. But if that shepherd's been close by and is threatening enough to worry someone as reckless as Pepper, it's gonna make me nervous either way.\" Sunny too, wore an expression of unease. \"Maybe we need to make sure none of us are going out alone. If the dog's modus operandi is to hunt in stealth mode, it would be all too easy for someone to not sense danger until it's too late.\" \"I'd be with you on that,\" said Bandit sagely. \"Pep was completely oblivious; if I hadn't looked around, he'd a' been on her.\" Dash shuddered. \"I guess that's it, then. We'll have to talk to everyone about this tonight, make sure the message gets across. No one else is getting hurt on my watch.\" \"You want me to bring Mom and Dad up to speed?\" Bandit asked. \"We were probably gonna drop by anyhow.\" \"Yeah, that'd be good. But, Brat, you wanna talk about what happened with Grandpa, best you just take it to Mom, avoid any big flare ups.\" Just then, Ella trotted around the corner, with Klaus right behind her. \"Hey Uncle B!\" she cried, her tail wagging. \"Hey Elly-belly, happy to be home?\" Bandit responded cheerily, leaving thoughts of his grandfather's death to the side for the time being. \"Ecstatic! I forgot how much fun it was to have a brother around to annoy.\" \" El! \" Dash warned. \"All in good fun,\" the pup added hastily. \"Anyhow- Klaus had this really great idea…\" \"We're listening,\" said Sunny. The Rottweiler spoke. \"Ve need to have house re-warming party, for your coming home. Ve all bring nice food, ve play some nice music, have good time.\" \"Yeah!\" Ella cried. \"And it'll be plenty loud, so then it would let the man behind the fence know we're back. He's probably missed us.\" Dash's tail began to wag. Raucous dance parties had always been her gang's specialty, and she needed no encouragement to offer her full support to the idea. \"You can count me in! I think Phoebe's overdue her first alley party. We'll have to make sure it's a good one. All right with you, Sunshine?\" \"That's definitely all right with me,\" Sunny said happily. \"You'll stick around, won't you, Bandit? I'm sure you and Pepper will find a corner of the alley to curl up in tonight.\" For a moment, Bandit hesitated. The circumstances of his grandfather's death would take time to swallow, and he felt the strongest pull to talk to his mother, so he might be able to make sense of everything. But she'd still be there tomorrow, and the warning he had to give about the menacing shepherd could wait until morning. \"Did someone say party ?\" Pepper exclaimed, popping up at her mate's side, seemingly out of nowhere. \"Yeah,\" said Bandit, \"Change of plans, baby, we've gotta give these guys a proper welcome home.\" As Pepper howled with mirth, his own tail began to wave. \"Looks like we're in!\" ","Summary":" Prologue A sleek and powerful shepherd lay on the rug by the heater, listening, distressed, to the "},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"looking through the screen","Author":"Fanfic girl of all worlds","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12741466","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Me and Redwalllover are back! this is kind of a misc. major crossover story! I sat on my top bunk in my room as my parents argued in the other room as a thunderstorm raged as it on, like it had all day. I had brown hair and blue-green eyes and freckles and stood around 5'3\", and a love for older Disney movies, as well as some other TV shows. My room was simple just a very dinky house in the middle of nowhere North Dakota. It had pink over green walls and a white roof, I stared up at the roof, which held a Christmas bell that said 'jingle Jesus' and my princess tent which was held up by thumb tacks, and some pictures I had drawn, as well as a back of a cereal box with a Morse code. My walls were covered in different things, a book shelf with books. Animal ark, The Pirate and the Princess, Avatar the last air bender, and some other books. A few My little pony, Eg and pony alike, my favorite was a large figure of Celestia, I took my gem encrusted beret and tucked it in her hair giving her an elegant look and a gold bracelet as her necklace. There were dream catcher shaped like hearts here and there, as well as a horse shoe or two, I had some foam boards with colorful fabric, either teal and green with zebra stripes or heads, and pink and orange. Those had different things on them, just sketches and other stuff like extra push pins. on the wall itself I had a sketch of my favorite singer Shania Twain, an American flag, and a Denver Bronco's one as well. I got tired of listening to them Bicker, I took out one of my favorite movies and put in in my Blu-ray player. As the adds played The thunder boomed louder than ever, and my mother told me not to dare because of the storm. I rolled my eyes as I clicked 'Play' on Oliver and Company. She walked out as I turned the lights off as the movie started with as usual 'once open a time in new York city' Lightning flashed and the house shook and then I blacked out.[Chapter 2] ok so that was just a taste here's the real thing! I slowly stood to my feet, shakily but it felt so weird, I had paws and fur, and I smelt so many new smells. I looked into a shiny car at myself, I looked like my old cat Simba! but my colors were not orange and white with blue eyes, I had a sandy brown coat for the most part but the ascents were darker brown, and my eyes were a bright blue! I wasn't a kitten but I wasn't a full grown Molly. I was some where in between, a juvenile. I saw an orange cat Oliver I thought remembering the little kitten. I walked to him, but he already was going to that weird hotdog guy, before I could stop him he ran back into the Alley. \"Poor guy...\" I sighed walking over to him. \"Wh-who are you?\" He asked, I just gave a kitty smile and said. \"It's ok, My names Rebeca, nice to meet you...\" I didn't finish as I knew what came next. Dodger. All that was missing was that interesting fresh beat. \"Boy you sure picked the wrong guy to get hotdogs from.\" Dodger said scratching his back, as much as I liked the cool dog, being a cat, I felt scared and hostile towards the canine. \"G-get way from me!\" Oliver said backing up hackles raised next to me, all I did was take on a mad cat stance, and growl just the slightest. \"Woah there I don't eat cats! There's too much fur. I been watchin' you and it looks like you could do with some professional guidance.\" Dodger said, by this time I was hissing. \"We can find food on our own Dog!\" I spoke with much venom, well as much as I could muster being less than half his size. \"Chill now what'd you say we change ol' Louie's mind about sharing some of those hotdogs?\" Dodger asked, my stomach rumbled and I bet Oliver was just as hungry if not more, I hadn't eaten since lunch, but the tabby kitten had most likely gone longer with out a solid meal. \"I'm not going back there again.\" Oliver said. I sat and shook my head. \"Not happening doggie!\" \"Chill kid, I'm an expert at these things all ya got's to do is learn some moves!\" Boy was this dog laying it on thick for us, but he didn't know I knew how things went. I still played along since this is my Favorite movie, as far as animal movies go, well ok Fox and the hound 2 is also up there in my favs. \"Moves?\" Oliver asked, I just cleaned my paw glaring at Dodger who said. \"Tempo, you know rhythm. this city's got beat, you gotta get into it. and once you get the beat you can do anything!\" \"You can?\" Oliver asks. \"And you think you know more than me? I've...\" I stopped, I couldn't say 'I've watched this movie a hundred times!' That would be rather stupid on my part. \"Absativly posalutly! the man you see before you is affectionately known as 'Old Louie'. A well known enemy of the four-legged world.\" Dodger says in his smooth talking voice. \"I think we ought to go kid.\" I said I knew what was gonna happen, I'd rip his ear off if he chased the kid, which I knew for a fact he was gonna do. \"I thought you might have picked up on the rhythm since your older. Oh well, what 'bout you kid? Starting to feel that rhythm?\" Dodger asked Oliver. I paused, I wanted to turn him into cat chow right about now, as a jackhammer pounded rhythmically. Then before I could stop Oliver, he said. \"Yeah I do feel it! When do we get those hotdogs?\" \"Right now!\" Dodger said as he began chasing Oliver, it was one of my favorite parts in the movie, Dodgers wild eyes, and Louie's reaction, but to watch this fight going on for real made my heart seize. I chased after Dodger yowling and hissing and taking a swipe or two at him, no way was he gonna trick Oliver out of those hot dogs if I was there, which I was. But that crafty dog got away from me, I followed a scared Oliver away from Louie, and on to a construction site, and heard Dodger singing to himself, I was gonna get that dog, at least the hot dogs. \"Hey you really got that rhythm kid, And what's your problem girly? I just swiped some hot dogs.\" Dodger said. \"For yourself!\" I growled careful of my words. \"I know what dogs like you do! they trick others into doing the work for you!\" But Oliver didn't heed my words. \"*pant* uh yeah we were good! so when are we gonna eat?\" Oliver said. \"We?\" Dodger asked as I tailed the duo, or 'dynamic Uno'. \"I'm starving! and I bet Rebeca is too!\" Ok Oliver just caught my heart with those words, I stopped and looked shockingly at the kitten and smiled kindly at him. \"Listen kids I hate to break it to ya, but the 'Dynamic trio' is now the Dynamic Uno.\" Ok, warm and fuzzy feeling gone when Dodger said that. \"What do you mean?\" Little Oliver asked as we wandered around the site. \"What I mean is our partnership is here by dissolved.\" Dodger said jumping on a truck. \"Wait, WAIT! YOUR NOT BEING FAIR! HALF OF THEM ARE HIS!\" I yelled at the dog. \"Fair's are for tourists kids conceder it a lesson in street savoir flair from New York's coolest quadruped!\" Dodger said moving onto another piece of equipment. \"Hey wait I helped you get those!\" Oliver and I ran after the Dodger as quick as we could. \"You want 'em? Come get 'em.\" Dodger said teasingly. \"Oh, you'll worry once I get my paws on you, you mutt.\" I growled as he began to sing. \"Arrroooo! But I'm warning you kids, One minute I'm in central park, then I'm down on Lexi street I said from the barracks to Saint Marks there's a single place to be I said, whooo, whooo, whooo, I'm street wise, I can improvise!

I said Whooo-whooo-whooo! as his voice faded out, we managed to hop on a car, and followed him to the docks. I loved that song, but hearing it now it made me so, so, sooooooooooo mad! Her really was trying to make us feel dumb wasn't he? Alright that's the end of Chapter one! R.I.P Simba my tom cat. \"Merry catmas! From Simba Claws.\" I loved my tom, may he rest in piece, the sweet kitty. and now Redwalllover! Author note: what lessons will Rebecca learn from living in the movie? Will she try to change the story in any way? Keep reading to find out[Chapter 3] We followed Dodger to an old Barge, it stunk bad, and Spanish music played from inside, and I hear Tito and Francis arguing from inside. I could just make out a few voices, one of my favorites from the movie spoke, and my whole body perked. Rita! She was so cool to me not prissy like Grogette but her own girl. Just like how I wanted to be, the only thing is Dodger was no where to be seen. Where was that dog anyhow? Never mind, there he was... Oliver and I were on the roof, looking in as they began eating our food, oh well I could handle no food but I doubt Oliver couldn't. \"So how'd you do it this time Dodger baby?\" Rita asked him as the ate, what she saw in him I didn't know, at least not after today, he was a jerk. \"Let me tell you it was tough, only I could've done it!\" Dodger boasted I had to roll my eyes, he sure laid it on think didn't he? \"Did you have to fight man? Huh-huh-huh?!\" Tito asked wildly, only a Chichewa could have that energy. \"Picture the city, 8th and Broadway, crowds bustling, the traffic roaring, the hotdogs sizzling. and the Dodger got some help from the community, then enters the opposition.\" Dodger went on, I rolled my eyes, the exact same time as Rita as he continued. \"two greedy, ugly, psychotic, monster! With razor sharp claws and dripping fangs, 9 lives! They come at me eyes burning! I knew my time had come! then suddenly!\" Oliver and I fell through the roof onto the floor, scaring the dogs. Poor Oliver got tangled in a shirt, and I landed on my paws, ruffly inside the coat. \"Well what is it?\" Rita asked, I knew Francis would shrug and Tito would come close. \"Hey man check it out!\" He said as Oliver stuck his paw out grabbing his snout. \"AY! It's an Alien!\" He ran and hid. Oliver and I poked our head out of the shirt, but I stayed back a little bit more. \"Cool it guys it's just Cats... \" Rita growled stepping close to us, I felt myself shaking, as Tito said 'two cats' in Spanish. \"Now how'd you find this place cats?\" She growled as we were backed up against a post. \"W-we followed this dog.\" Oliver said. \"He's lying he's lying he's lying he's lying he's lying he's lying he's-!\" Rita kicked Tito back. \"Why would a cat follow a dog?\" Francis asked and Einstein said. \"Yeah.\" \"We just wanted some of the sausages we helped him get...\" I said shrinking back, still trembling. \"We saw him come down!\" Oliver said worriedly as Tito said we were spies and should get eaten. \"Hey that's-that's him over there!\" Oliver said before Dodger, who was watching TV said. \"Hey kitties what took you so long?\" \"Relax kids.\" Rita said winking at the two of us, Boy did that give me a boost! \"Razor sharp claws?!\" Tito laughed. \"Dripping fangs!\" Francis said. \"I kinda like those burning eyes!\" Rita teased batting her lashes. \"Hey guys keep it down the games on.\" Dodger said lazily. \"Ha-ha tough Dodger man, has to get help from cats!\" Tito laughed teasing Dodger, he turned off the TV while bouncing up and down. \"Hey cool it Tito.\" Dodger said. \"Hey lets see these bad kitties fight in action!\" Tito said. \"Hey Tito look!\" Dodger said jumping onto the Chichewa. Then the dog fight began. \"What a bunch of over grown ooof!\" Rita said as Tito hit the back of her head. \"Alright that's it!\" Oliver hid as did I, I might've joined but they were really going at it. \"Alright, Alright knock it off! Enough! what's the matter with you guys! Don't you understand Sykes will be here any minute!\" Fagin said. \"No-no! Ha-ha no! Down!\" AS the dogs went after the treats he held. After the warm Welcome, a loud car horn was heard, I went to grab Oliver and run but I wasn't big enough to get far with him fast, especially not with... Roscoe and Desoto Major bad news! I pulled Oliver as far back as I could as the two Dobermans came in growling at the group. \"You guys miss us?\" Roscoe chuckled. Like heck we missed you guys SO MUCH! NOT ON YOUR EVIL LIVES! I thought pushing Oliver behind me. \"You know Rita I can't figure out why you'd want to live in a dump like this, when you could be living up town, with a class act like myself.\" Roscoe said brushing up next to Rita who leaned away from him. \"Isn't rather Dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in a single sentence?\" Francis said. I couldn't help but giggle, It was funny! Dodger cooled the brewing fight, Oliver and I moved back when Roscoe broke the TV. Please let Desoto not come near us, Please! \"Hey Roscoe Look what I found!\" Desoto growled pulling us out of hiding. oh no! claws don't fail me! I thought figuring out how to get my claws in and out. \"Forget it Desoto, we gotta go!\" Roscoe said walking away. \"But I like cats! I like to eat 'em!\" Desoto said inching all the closer to us, Oliver was scared and we each clawed at his face. Now both Dobermans were in front of us ready to tear us to shreds, then the gang surrounded us, I sighed. Safe! \"Run along Roscoe, Your masters calling.\" Rita purred. \"We aren't finished with you yet Dodger.\" Roscoe said. \"You'll all pay starting with those cats...\" Desoto said as they went up the rickety old stairs. Tito began ranting that they should come down and get torn to shreds, that's something I'd like in on that! \"Alright kids, what'd I tell you guys old Dodge can really pick 'em.\" He said. Fagin walked in and was dripping wet. The dogs covered him up. \"Thanks guys! That reminds me! I saw Desoto's nose, who did that?\" Fagin asked, Dodger picked up Oliver and Rita me. \"You? and You? ha-ha-ha that took a lot of guts! we've never had cats in the gang, we can use all the help we can get!\" Fagin said scratching us, boy did it feel good, my throat rumbled. What was I doing?! It took a moment of thinking but I was purring! as comfortable as it was getting pet, I hoped down, Oliver needed to feel the love, not me I was good, besides watching was enough for me. Rita went into her makeshift bed, as Einstein held a worn book out to Fagin. He began reading the book, as we all listened. I smiled laying on my side contently. soon after most of them had fallen asleep, Dodger turned off the light waking Oliver and I back up. Oliver went over to Dodger and snuggled next to him in his bed, and I as weird as I felt, but still natural, walked over and snuggled next to Rita. Rita only woke up when Oliver jumped down to run over to Dodger. I was drifting off to sleep as Rita draped a blanket over me. This was all new to me, but I wasn't complaining. I found myself purring as I drifted off to sleep The whole adventure of just one day replaying in my mind. Ok so that was fun also Thank you to everyone who read or is reading this! and Rita is my FAVORITE! and now Redwalllover! Author note: so Rebecca has experienced an exciting moment in the story. But how will she adapt as things continue? Stayed tuned for the next chapter.[Chapter 4] So chapter three! enjoy! also thank you for reading! The next morning I stretched and yawned, blinking. Oh, right... I was thrown into Oliver and company... and I'm still here... Wow! I snuggled RITA! WOW! This is so much, too much! and I'm loving it! I snuggled next to Rita, man I hadn't ever slept that good in ever! We all got into Fagin's cart, two days left to live, I could manage that, hey might as well go out happy! Right? Fagin gave us a pep-talk as he pulled into an alley. \"Dead men do not buy dog food so get out there and... FETCH!\" We all jumped out of the cart as he sped away. \"Alright if Mr. Sykes don't see some cold hard cash in a few days... We are Doberman chow. lets start on Columbus avenue.\" Dodger said as we stepped out into the street. \"What kind of work do we do anyway?\" Oliver asked. \"Investment banking man! Haven't you read about us in the wall street journal?\" Tito said as he paced an Apple to Francis. \"Yes captains of elm street.\" He said. \"Cool! Can we be ones too?\" Oliver said as we came up to the road, oh, man my Favorite song was next! I had stuck Close to Oliver and Rita, since he was the only other Cat, and She was the only other girl. \"Yeah, when you got your pals you got all you need.\" Dodger said. \"Really Dodge?\" Oliver asked. \"We gotta clean you up child, and give you some on the job training.\" Rita said gently nudging me. I smiled as the song began. \" Oooh ye-eah! Now listen up you got a lot to learn And if you don't learn you don't eat. But if your tuff and always use your head you'll be right at home on the street. When you've got talent Everything is free, watch how we do things oooo I guaranty! You're gonna see how the best survive we make an art out of staying Alive if you do just as your told, These are street of gold! Every boulevard is a miracle Mile You'll take the town and you'll take it in style If you paly it brave and bold These are streets of Gold! Ah-ha-ha! \" Rita finished as we came up to a crossing. \"Well lookie here!\" Dodger said as Tito said. \"Hey a coffer shuffle!\" I knew what would happen, but listened as I jumped onto the car, with Tito and Oliver. \"Ha-ha hey check it out man! Beep, Beep!\" Tito laughed as I jumped up on the Dash, soon followed by Oliver. \"H-h-h-h-hey Tito, you know there's something back there!\" Oliver said. \"Stop hassling me man! I just got one more wire!\" Tito said. I watched out front, having never seen what happened. Oliver went to climb out and he stepped on the keys, turning the car on frying Tito. We went to get out as the car sounded off. Oliver got tangled in wires and I did trying to help him out. \"Oh, you poor Kitties! Let me help you!\" Jenny said untangling us gently. \"Jenny... Are you alright?\" Winston asked. We arrived at her house a little while later, seeing it in the movie was one thing but from my point of view, which was currently chest level to a young girl and being cat sized as I was, it really was HUGE! \"Now Jenny we can't just take strays off the street.\" Winston said, boy did this girl know all the right spots, I was purring like a Cadillac! \"But look at the poor things, they're half starved!\" Jenny said as we entered the house. \"I know your growing attached to them, but do try to understand, your parents left me responsible for you.\" Winston said and Jenny said back. \"They won't mind. Really! Don't worry kitties I'll take care of you.\" \"Georgette is not going to like this...\" Winston mumbled, oh man I could just see her singing 'perfect isn't easy' which it isn't but she was flawed because she was perfect weird right? She'd be walking down the steps soon, I didn't care, whatever Jenny was making, it smell WAY good! Winston stepped on an egg shell as the phone rang. \"Jenny it's your parents!\" Winston said from the other room. \"Oh, yeah! wait till I tell them!\" Jenny said rushing towards the phone. \"Georgette I wouldn't go in there if I was you.\" Winston warned. She walked in and gasped. I didn't blame her two cats eating from her food dish, oh man was this food great! \"What is the meaning of this? Bark, bark, bark! Winston! Bark, bark, bark! I guess I'll have to handle this myself.\" She growled, coming towards us sweetly. I picked my head up and began cleaning my face, knowing full well what was gonna happen. I planned on letting Oliver eat, as much as he could. \"Hello...\" Georgette said sweetly, I looked up at the Poodle and smiled gently. \"Hello.\" \"I don't mean to be rude, but, do you know who's food dish you and your friend are eating out of?\" Georgette asked super sweetly, man did it give me the creeps! but two could play at her twisted game. \"Beg pardon, Ms. But this is the bowl Jenny gave us... I'm sorry if it's yours.\" I apologized. \"Well aren't you a polite wittle kwitty!\" Georgette cooed. \"And do you have any Idea who's home this is?\" \"Yours.\" I stated plainly. \"Yes, everything from the Doorknobs down is MINE!\" Georgette was in my face by this time but I didn't flinch. I knew she was prissy but once again being and seeing it first paw was different, She was the most stuck up Person I'd ever met! I then saw Jenny come into the room. I just trotted past her and rubbed against Jenny's legs sweetly, purring all the while. \"Oh, Georgette! I see you've met Oliver and...\" Jenny paused, I stared at her my head to the side just a bit. \"Rebeca!\" Wow whatever I did she read my mind! \"I've got great news! Mom and Dad just said I could keep them!\" Jenny smiled stroking mine and Oliver's backs. \"I'm sure you three are gonna be the best of friends!\" Georgette forced a smile and chuckle. Woo~ done! Yeah! I showed that Poodle! Anyways whatever Jenny made it WAS SO TASTY! (I don't really know but I bet it was great!) Author note: what is Rebecca going to do? How will she deal with what's coming? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out![Chapter 5] ok new chapter! whooo! I laid on the Piano while Jenny played, Oliver played a key or two, as did I. Jenny sang, while Oliver played, and I turned the pages. That day she took us on a boat ride in the park and for a run! She even gave us Ice-cream! and we went on a carriage ride, then she took us to a pet shop, where Oliver and I got bowls with our names written on them in fancy letter, and we got Collars. Ok so it felt kind of weird to wear one but I had worn choked necklaces in the past, Oliver's was a bright blue about the same color as my eyes, and mine was teal with diamonds going around it. That night Jenny sang to us as she tucked us into her bed, she kissed our forehead and whispered. \"Goodnight kitties.\" The next day I heard the Doorbell ring, I was hiding in Georgette's room just out of sight, just out of reach. then the door slammed shut. \"UGH! 'I love you Oliver and Rebeca play with Georgette!' Oh, I'd like to play with them Alright the little furballs!\" Georgette ranted and I mimicked her, but then the gang came into the room. She screamed when she saw Dodger, I just had to giggle. \"Who are you?! and what do you want!? WINSTON! BARK, BARK, BARK!\" Georgette jumped on her Vanity knocking it over. \"Don't come any closer! I knew this day would happen one day...\" As usual she was being overly dramatic, I rolled my eyes and decided to come down from my perch. \"Whoa Sister! you're barkin' up the wrong tree We're not here for you!\" Dodger said as I walked slowly over. \"It's not? It's not?! WELL WHY NOT?! What's the problem spot, not good enough for you? I mean do you even know who I am?\" Georgette barked. \"The prissiest Poodle in the universe?\" I said walking closer. \"56 blue ribbons, 14 regional trophies, 6 time national Champion!\" Georgette said. \"And we're all very impressed right guys?\" Dodger asked as the gang looked around the room. \"Very impressed...!\" Tito panted. He then kissed her paw and said his full name most of which I didn't catch. \"You little creep! WINSTON!\" Georgette barked. \"Excuse me sister, who's Rex?\" Rita asked I could answer that one. \"One of her many boyfriends...\" I chuckled. She the made rude yet sophisticated remarks about the lot of us. \"Relax. Champ, we'll leave as soon as we get our cats!\" Dodger said as Georgette went on another rant. \"Your cat?\" Georgette chuckled her smile turning Devious, I had snuck away to Jenny's room to sunbathe in the light. Not long after the gang and Georgette came into the room, Oliver was napping on his little kitty bed on Jenny's bed. \"Look at him Dodge, honey lets just forget the whole thing.\" Rita said. \"No, no! you can't do that! you don't understand their little souls are traumatized!\" Georgette said. Not long after she said this I was tossed into a bag along with Oliver as the Gang made their getaway. Next thing I knew we were back at the boat and the gang was celebrating. \"Wha? Hey what's goin' on you guys?\" Oliver asked slightly confused. \"Just the Rescue of the Century!\" Tito said. \"What Rescue?!\" I asked looking around. Oliver and I stuttered at a lose for word, alright so I much rather Hang around Rita but that place was so nice! \"You ok kid?\" Rita asked worriedly. \"Yeah...yeah I... I'm fine...\" I said. Dodger and Oliver had a small argument about us being there, then Rita said. \"We never should have took them Dodger...\" Boy did she just keep getting cooler, and cooler! Oliver and I were making our way up stairs when Fagin came down. Fagin plopped down in his chair hold Oliver and I. \"What's this?\" He asked looking at our collars. \"So, that's where you've been, Looks like your doing alright for yourselves, Oliver and Rebeca. your owner probably spend more on catnip the we do food in a month! he's probably worried sick about you! all alone in that big house with only his money... Only his millions, and millions of dollars... THAT'S IT WE'RE SAVED!\" I held tight to Fagin's shirt as he moved quickly around the boat grabbing paper and Pencil and a table. I knew what came next and I didn't want it to happen not in the least. I watched as Fagin practiced his deal with Sykes with Dodger, I really didn't want this to happen, but I knew it would happen. We went down, into the old ware house, it was even scarier in Person, especially after the two Doberman's attacked us. Fagin handed us to Sykes, I was frozen in fear. We were re-tucked in Fagin's coat as he waited on the docks for Jenny and, as much as I rather not see her once again, Georgette. Fagin made a fool of himself when Jenny taped his back. acting as if he was going to be arrested. He walked away from Jenny just out of sight and took us out of his coat, I tried to go to Jenny as did Oliver but Fagin held us. \"Hey look, there's two cats here, I-I don't know maybe they are yours?!\" Fagin handed us to Jenny, I hoped on her shoulder and purred, while Oliver curled up in her arms. \"Sykes... W-wait! Just wait!\" Fagin said and Sykes grabbed Jenny, and drove off. Oliver and I were thrown out of the car. The gang ran towards us, and We were helped up by Rita and Dodger. \"You kids ok?\" Dodger asked. \"Jenny, Jenny! He took Jenny!\" Oliver said trying to find the car. \"Don't worry we'll get her back.\" Dodger said. \"You will?\" Oliver asked. \"Of course they will!\" I smiled hugging Oliver. We all took off running, with Fagin on his bike trailing us. \"It's all locked up Dodger!\" Francis said as we stood outside the warehouse. \"There has got to be a way in... Yeah Francis!\" Dodger looked around planning on how to get in. \"Francis you all set?\" Dodger asked Francis from atop the crates. He muttered something in French. and we shouted his Nick-name. \"Maestro!\" Dodger said as Tito played a drum roll. \"Ready kids?\" Dodge asked. \"Let's take to the sky!\" I said. \"Go!\" With that Francis jumped on the board launching us up and through a window. We crept around until I held Oliver back around a Corner just as Desoto came around the Corner. Well what'll happen? Who knows... Redwall. Author note: what will Rebecca do in the story next? How will it affect the outcome? Continue reading to find out![Chapter 6] So been a while, so here we go and just so you know happy holidays! I don't wanna offend so I won't be specific. anyhow here's the story! \"Come on Desoto!\" Roscoe growled, never would I thought he'd be our saving grace! Oliver and I opened a small door, and Dodger went to go through first but Tito said. \"Hey, hey, hey! There is a lady present!\" \"Well at least one you have some manners.\" Georgette quipped. \"Right so, why doesn't Rita go after you Ms. Georgette! Or before the guys on the boat or on other things?!\" I said rolling my eyes as the gang entered the warehouse. We were looking for where Jenny was, and If I was being honest I was really worried for her. \"And remember keep quiet!\" Dodger said, I walked over to Georgette and got ready for her scream when her nail broke, after all I didn't know how she broke it so, I'd close her mouth. \"Ahhh!\" She screamed. I placed my paw over her mouth. \"Shh! We know you broke a nail ok?! Now be quiet!\" I hissed. A camera was rotated our direction and Tito disabled it. We walked further and there was Jenny! Dodger disused a game plan. \"H-hey Dodger, I think we ought to look out for Roscoe and Desoto! It's like they're really close.\" I whispered, careful not to give away that I knew that they really were. I watched as Sykes stormed out of the office. Oliver, Dodger, Rita, hurried into the room to free Jenny. I was up on a loft with, none other than, Georgette! I had just cut some ropes so the tarp would fall. time for part 3! \"Oh, boys!\" Georgette and I purred as we dropped the tarp on top of the two Dobermans. \"Whoopsy daisy!\" Georgette chuckled, and I said. \"I think I might be starting to like you Georgette!\" We then hurried into the office, Einstein shut the door and I locked it behind us. \"Francis, keep a look out.\" Dodger said. Rita worked on untying Jenny. \"Is the coast clear Francis?\" Dodger asked but Francis was watching a ballet. \"Frankie!\" He snapped changing it to the cameras and then we saw Sykes storming to the room. \"What're we gonna do Dodge?\" Rita asked. I hopped on his back and said. \"Hey Tito could you hotwire that?\" I pointed to a winch. \"Hey no way Rebecca, man! I been BBQed too many times already!\" Tito protested until Georgette said. \"Good luck Alonso, I'll be waiting for you.\" \"Hey, Hi-ho, Hi-ho it's off to work we go...\" Tito said as he climbed up to the wire box. We all climbed onto the chair with Jenny, as Tito made the winch go up, just as... Sykes came in. Man I didn't like that guy! though how many people do? and then he shut it down! Man that was fun! We slid down a chute of sorts and right to him, man if I were human I would have been running mad by that time! And man god must've been looking out for me up above because in came Fagin! We raced off an his bike, as Roscoe and Desoto became dots in the distance. \"Hey man you're ugly!\" Tito yelled. \"And you're uglier than him!\" I yelled as well. \"And you're ugly part 3!\" \"Ha-ha and you invented Ugly!\" \"Uh-oh...\" Tito and I said as Sykes car roared over the hill. Well it was nice living that one day, when I discovered the internet... Down into the subway we fled but Sykes was hot on our heels. He ran into the back of the scooter and Jenny was launched onto the hood of his car. Sykes reached out for her but Before he could pull her in Oliver clawed and bit his hand. He was launched into the back with the Dobermans... and with the courage I'd never known, I jumped into the back of the car and began clawing at them. And just when I thought all was lost, Dodger jumped in! Man I'd never been so happy to see that mutt! I sort of Lost track of what was happening, it was wild though! I didn't stay long though I jumped into the front seat and tried to stop Sykes from grabbing Jenny but he threw me into the scooter. Man I hated him! A train was speeding toward us. Georgette screamed as Tito did some cool stunt! Sykes got ran over and Oliver thrown, man was I worried for him, he'd became like a little brother to me in this short while, they'd all became like family to me, even thought they were movie characters. Dodger brought Oliver who was all hunched up, and Jenny and I dove for the kitten. I felt like crying, he couldn't be dead, Could he? \"Oliver? Oliver!\" Jenny hugged the kitten, Dodger and me. Just a few days later, we were at Jenny's house, and all was well! We barked and Mewed 'happy birthday' to Jenny. Tito and Georgette were dancing in the other room though. We all gave Jenny gifts, mine was a pretty rock I'd found in the park the other day, it seemed like a nice enough gift, and Jenny seemed to like it. And goodbyes were said, I sat on the window sill watching Dodger and Oliver. \" Why should I worry? Why should I care? \" Jenny pick Oli up, Oli was my nickname for him, and said. \"Bye! Good Bye!\" \" tell me why should care Say I may not have a dime Oh but I've got street savor flair why should we worry? why should we care Say we may not have a dime Oh but we got street savor Flair! Why should we worry why should we care It's just a bebopulation and we got street savor flair! The rhythm of the city oh once you get it down said you can own the town you come to wear the crown! Why should we worry? why should we care? it's just a dowopulation and we got street savor flair! why should we worry? why should we care and even when we cross that line we got street savor Flair! \" As their voices faded off I felt myself falling asleep. and I did. When I opened my eyes, it looked like I was in my room... that's weird it was from a different angle, and why would I be in my room? My head shot up and looked around. Wait a new York minute! This WAS my room! I looked around and saw my room and there I was laying on top of my bed curled up like a cat! I climbed down and saw the TV running the credits for the movie. \"So... it... was just... a dream...\" I sighed sadly. That really sucked, I was super happy! I looked sadly at the TV, about to turn it off when I saw a picture of the Gang, but there were two Puppies by Rita and Dodger. One looked like Dodger but with a tuft of red hair. and the other almost just like Rita! I'd never seen that before, weird. \"Hey Becca!\" Dodger said, I gasped and staggered back. \"Hope to see you soon Kid, everybody's been missing ya!\" Dodger said. \"Oh, before I forget!\" Jenny dug in her pocket and pulled out the collar from my dream. \"Here, I want you to have this so you remember our fun times!\" She tossed the collar at me, and it fazed through the screen and landed in my open hands. I looked at it, it looked real, felt real, it was real! \"Th-thanks...\" I said holding the collar close. The screen went black not long after and I just stared at it and the collar. So it hadn't been a dream, it was real! all that happened! I was freaking out, but for now I had something to remember it by. Wow what'll happen to Rebecca next? and if it really happened who were those pups? Find out if there is a next chapter. L8r![Chapter 7] I held the collar close to me. I couldn't believe that had really happened! I ran the memory over and over and over! It didn't seem real, but I held the collar close and I knew it was real. \"Rebeca?\" My mother, who I stopped calling 'mom' after I turned 12 we never got along well so I call her by her first name, Martha, asked. \"Y-yeah?\" I said looking at the collar in my hands, which she grabbed. \"What in the world? Why do you have a cat collar with your name on it?\" Martha asked holding the color up and looking at it. \"Well... you won't really believe this but... I was in Oliver and Company!\" I beamed. \"You're right I don't believe that.\" She deadpanned. \"No really it happened, I was a cat and I-I... it was so cool!\" I smiled wide. \"Riiiiiiight... sure you did... Look Rebeca I love you but... this is too much.\" Martha said, rolling her eyes. \"I... it happened!\" I couldn't convince her, no matter how much I tried. I wore the collar as a bracelet or necklace, and when I did I felt close to everyone from the movie. Some times if I jangled the bell I'd hear their voices. \" Aye get her off me! \" \" Come on guys chill! \" \" Francis, Francis. Francis! \" \" Good morning, Oliver. \" \" Oh, Alonso, there you are. Shall we pick up where we left off last time ?\" \" Hiya Dodger! \" \" You're just a bunch of over grown pups! \" \" That's a good bumper! \" But then I'd hear two new voices in the mix... I was confused by it but hey I liked my little window back there. \" Stop pullin' my ear! \" \" Your just a sissy Frit! \" I held the bell close to me at night, recalling everything that had happened while I was over there. and not long after I found a poster for the movie but it had those two mystery pups... it confused me to no end! So what do you think? how will it play out in the end? And why Do I loath Martha so? I guess you'll have to wait to find out! won't you?

I sat on my top bunk i"},{"Movie":"Merlin","Title":"Une famille tant voulue","Author":"electra tipton","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12398957","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapitre 1 assis sur son trône le regard plein d'ennui, scrutant la salle ou tout les chevaliers parlaient de la dernière bataille gagnée avec enthousiasme. Leurs sourires, leur fierté, tout ce bruit le fit encore une fois soupir a en fendre l'âme. Depuis la mort du roi Uther lors d'un combat, Arthur fit ce qui était logique il fut proclamé roi de camelot Majesté venez festoyer avec nous. Tournant la tète a sa droite il vit lancelot qui se tenait a quelques pas de lui et le regardait avec inquiétude. Je n'ai rien a festoyer pour le moment mon cher lancelot. Ceci n'était qu'une bataille, que nous avons gagnée certes mais il en aura bien d'autre. Le chevalier le regarda puis baissa les yeux pleins de honte. Le roi n'avait ps tord, des demain les vandales pouvait de nouveau attaquer. Il ne fallait pas se relâcher de vigilance. Le roi comprit qu'il manqua de tact, et voulait s'en excusez. Il se leva se dirigea vers les autres en demandant qu'on lui serve a manger, regarda vers lancelot qui n'avait pas bougé plonger dans ses réflexions. Un micro sourire apparue sur son visage. Viens donc lancelot, si tu réfléchis trop ta tête va exploser Tournant la tête vers tous les rires il vit le sourire du roi, et alla les rejoindre. Le festin terminé, les chevaliers se mirent a chanter au grand désespoir de leur roi car il a été entrainer dans le chant par lancelot et Gauvain. Quant un bruit sourd retentit en plein salle du trône. Tous sortirent leurs épées, une lumière venait d'apparaitre devant eux. Instinctivement lancelot Gauvain Perceval formèrent une barrière autour du roi, mais celui-ci n'en démordra pas et passa tous devant eux. Devant de formait une forme humaine et Arthur craignait que ce ne soit morgana qui ne venait se venger. Mais pourquoi maintenant âpres tant années d'absences. Flash back Morgane et morguse étaient devant camelot et incitait Uther et Arthur de venir se battre ou elle brûlait tout camelot. Mais seul le prince arriva avec merlin et les chevaliers. Morguse invoqua des montres pour occuper les chevaliers. Morgane quant a elle voulait tuer le prince de ses propres mains, alors elle fit apparaître un couteau et s'avançait vers lui et leva ma main et elle sentit la chair sur son couteau. Elle jubilait mais ce n'est pas Arthur qu'elle poignarda mais merlin. Le prince se retourna et vit merlin tomber et s'avança vers lui , il était blessé aux cotes et la lame était empoisonnée. Etant distrait par la blessure de son serviteur, il ne vit Morguse arriver derrière lui mais merlin oui il prit donc Excalibur fit dégager le prince et embrocha la sorcière qui poussa un cri de terreur stoppant tout combat. Toutes les têtes se tournèrent vers le cri et vit la sorcière et l'épée du roi en elle. Morgane les yeux écarquillés, on pouvait lire dans ses yeux de la détresse, la haine vers merlin et Arthur, la peur de perdre sa sœur. Mais elle ne vit pas les yeux de merlin devenir de couleur or pour lui lancer un maléfice et s'écroula a genoux mais voyant qu'elle avait perdu, disparue dans un éclat de lumière. Plus de peur que de mal merlin fut conduit chez Gauis et lui donna un antidote avec devoir de se reposer que le prince approuva en le remerciant de lui avoir sauvé la vie. Que merlin accepta avec plaisir. Fin du flash back La forme se dessinait plus nettement quand une petite voix en pleures se fit comprendre Aidez-moi s'il vous plait, mon papa est blessé . Les sortants de leur stupeur, se trouvait devant eux un petit garçon, a la tête blonde et aux yeux bleu qui était penché sur un homme. Alors ils avancèrent avec précaution cela pouvait être un piège, mais dès qu'il vit l'homme allongé au sol, en sang entrain de rassurer le petit garçon, avec un sourire. Merlin. C'était Merlin devant eux. Le roi stoppa tout geste. Merlin cela faisait si longtemps qu'il n'avait pas vu ce visage. Voulant de lever pour réconforter son fils qui n'arrêtait pas de pleurer, il grimaça de douleur en tenant sa cuisse. Papa , appela le petit avec panique. Tout va bien. C'est juste une petite douleur, voulant rassuré le petit avec un immense sourire. Mais son sourire se fana quant il vit qui était devant lui. Et dans un murmure de panique. Arthur dit merlin ne comprenant ce qu'il fait devant lui. Mais quant il scrutait la salle il reconnut la grande salle de camelot, il paniqua en invoquant une boule de protection autour de son fils et lui en regardant avec frayeur celui qui lui avait brisée son cœur.[Chapter 2] Flack back -Debout sir, le soleil est levé. Merlin venait de débouler dans la chambre du prince Arthur qui sursauta de son lit -Je vais te jeter au pilori pour la journée si tu ne sors d'ici merlin . -Cela ne changera pas de d'habitude mais voila. Tenez c'est pour vous. Etant torse nu le prince s'assit sur le lit et merlin rougit, sans pouvoir quitter du regard ce torse dessiné pas la musculature, pouvoir toucher cette peau, si douce a ses yeux, la caresser, mais pour lui ces sentiments n'étaient normaux et comme a chaque fois il les refoulait. un serviteur et encore moins un homme ne peut espère une relation qui plus est amoureuse avec un prince. -Si tu veux m'amadouer avec un cadeau minable ca ne va pas marcher. Ces paroles blessèrent merlin au plus profond de son âme mais il ne le montra pas. Mais non, crétin royal, c'est votre anniversaire je voulais vous donner le mien de cadeau en premier. Arthur était abasourdi merlin tenait devant lui une assiette qu'il avait surement pris dans les cuisines du château, un gâteau de couleur blanc avec une bougie pour décoration, il évitait de regarder le prince dans les yeux. Joyeux anniversaire sire, je sais que ce n'est rien comparé a ce que vous allez recevoir dans la journée mais j'ai voulu le faire moi-même . Arthur prit l'assiette que le présentait son serviteur et avec son index gouta le gâteau qui n'avait pas une jolie forme, mais son regard s'illumina quand son doigt atteignit sa bouche. C'est délicieux merlin je te remercie. Et le visage de merlin afficha un immense sourire qui fit rire le prince. La journée se passa plus mouvementée entre les rois des pays qui venaient souhaiter et fêter l'anniversaire du prince. Merlin était assez anxieux, il n'avait pas vu le prince depuis le réveil, et avait un autre cadeau a lui donner. Gaius venu le voir lui dire qu'il devait faire le service ce soir a la fête d'anniversaire d'Arthur. La fête battait son plein, le prince et le roi sur le trône voyaient le défilé de tous les invités leur rendre hommage, tous avec un paquet a la main. Ce la dura des heures et Arthur commençait a s'ennuyer mais un seule regard du roi lui fit reprendre ses esprits. Le défilé terminé festin débuta et la boisson coulait a flow. Le prince buvait sans compter avec les chevaliers et flirter avec ses dames. Toi, le serviteur, ce spectacle, de beuverie venant de son fils, agaçait le roi. Majesté, se prosternant devant le roi , merlin se doutait ce qu'il allait le demander. C'était ainsi a chaque fête. Le prince Arthur en a eu assez pour ce soir, ramener le dans ses appartements. Tout de suite mon roi. Cachant son sourire, merlin se dirigea vers la table du prince et lui chuchota a l'oreille. Ne croyant aucun mot de sin serviteur, Arthur leva la tète vers son père qui le regardait avec des yeux d'indignation. Sans un autre commentaire, il se leva en chancelant et demanda a merlin de l'aider a tenir debout. Le trajet jusqu'à la chambre se réalisa non moins sans encombre. Entre Arthur qui traitait son père de tous les noms et menaçait merlin qui rirait de ses pitreries. Arrivé dans la chambre, le prince s'allongea ivre mort sur son lit, ayant l'habitude merlin soupira et l'enleva son trop de vêtements et le couvrit. Debout au bord du lit, le serviteur, observa le corps allongé sur le lit, qui avait le visage en sueur, et son regarda dévia vers ses lèvres roses qu'il désirait tant. Un baiser rien qu'un baiser ne peut faire de mal de toute façon il est dormi se disait il. Mettant son genou sur le lit, il se pencha vers le visage du prince et déposa délicatement ses lèvres sur celle d'Arthur, comme il l'imageait elles étaient si douces, si sucrées. D'un coup il sursauta, les yeux écarquillés de peur, Arthur étant endormi répondait au baiser et il se dégagea. En ouvrant les yeux, il vit Merlin au bout du lit, sa respiration saccadée, les larmes aux yeux, on pouvait y lire de la peur. Enlevant la couverte sur lui, il se leva, et se dirigea vers celui qui reculait a chaque pas qu'il faisait. Dos collé au mur, merlin regardait Arthur venir a lui, fermant les yeux s'attendant a une réprimande ou un coup de poing pour la bêtise qu'il venait de faire. Il sentit une main lui caresser les cheveux, puis qu'on lui enlevait ses vetements. Tu t'entes a ne pas ouvrir les yeux . Ne voulant toujours pas le prince captura ses lèvres et embarqua dans un baiser demandant l'accès avec sa langue que merlin lui accorda. Le baiser fut stopper pour reprendre leur respiration. Ouvre les yeux merlin, et dis moi pourquoi tu mas embrassé pendant que je dormais. Oui pourquoi avait il fait cela, pourquoi le désirait-il ? pourquoi il cherchait du regard jour après jour, depuis plusieurs mois ? pourquoi il avait mal quand le prince flirtait avec toutes ces dames et en particulier en Guenièvre ? pourquoi son cœur se serrait quand Arthur le traitait d'incapable et lui disait qu'il ne servait a rien ? la réponse était la sous son nez depuis le début, pourquoi ne l'avait il pas vu, pourquoi s'entêtait il a repousser tous ces sentiments. Il ouvrit les yeux et plongea son regard plein de larmes dans celui d'Arthur, cela était tellement évident mais ne voulait juste pas l'admettre. Je vous aime sir, je vous aime tellement Art… il nu pas le temps de terminer sa phrase que ses lèvres furent capturées. Les gémissements qu'émettait merlin incitait le prince a continuer ses caresses, il délaissa les lèvres de son serviteur, lécha les tétons descendant en faisant des baisers sur tous le torse de merlin et de son autre mais défit le pantalon. Il regarda l'érection de celui-ci donna un coup de langue et les jambes e merlin flageolèrent mais resta debout, regardant son prince lui procurer le plaisir intense qu'il ressentait et qui lui donnait des frissons, les vas et viens que faisait Arthur sur son sexe l'emmenait bientôt au bord de l'explosion Arthur arrêtez vous je vais venir. Avait réussi a dire merlin, ce qui stoppa le prince et le retourna en le collant sur le mur. Sans attendre il sortit son sexe et se mis a le frotter sur l'anus de merlin qui paniqua de ne pas être préparé Si tu m'aimes vraiment reste tranquille, je n'ai pas le temps pour des enfantillages, a moins que tu veuilles que j'arrête. Non ne vous arrêtez. un cri de douleur sortit a la suite de ses mots, Arthur venait de le pénétrer sans ménagement, mais s'arrêta pour regarder merlin et commença a le pilonner sous ses gémissements. Merlin était perdu, il avait mais l'amour qu'il avait pour Arthur et le plaisir qu'il était entrain de lui donner surpassait la douleur. Les vas et viens du prince se firent plus rapide et plus fort. Tu es si serré mieux qu'une catin , disait le prince tout en le pilonnant de plus en plus fort. S'abandonnant au plaisir merlin le suppliait de continuer encore plus fort, et Arthur se libera en lui dans un cri animal. Il retira son sexe, attrapa le bras de bras et se dirigea vers le lit et le jeta dessus. Le serviteur se laissait faire parce qu'il n'avait pas encore jouit. En signe de soumission, il se mit a quatre pattes et suppliait le prince de le prendre et de le faire jouir. Le prince le regarda et ses yeux n'étaient que désir. Il monta a son tour sur le lit et le pénétra une fois de plus. Plus rapide plus fort encore et encore, il le pilonnait. Je vais venir merlin, jouit pour moi. Merlin était au bord de la jouissance sans me se toucher, il se déversa sur le lit princier, et tomba sur lit suivi du prince qui a sa grande surprise ronflait déjà. Il reprenait son souffle, en caressant la chevelure de son amant. Rien qu'a cette pensée il sourit, il avait couché avec l'homme qu'il désirait et plein de question se bousculait dans sa tête mais il s'abandonna au bras de Morphée. Réveillé par quelques rayons de soleil qui ont réussi a pénétrer dans la chambre, le prince papillonna des yeux avant de les ouvrir. Il grimaça de douleur en tenant sa tête, mais quelque chose clochait, regardant sur le cote du lit, il vit une forme allongé sous les draps il commençait a craindre qu'a cause de ses beuveries il est ramené une princesse dans ses appartements ce qui serait une catastrophe. Perdu dans ses pensées il vit pas la forme près de lui bouger, Bonjour sir, merlin avait dit cela avec une pointe d'humour faisant sursauter Arthur qui le regardait avec des yeux incompréhensions. Merlin sombre crétin que fais tu ici en étant tout nu ? oh non se disait merlin, il ne se rappelle de rien. Au ton qu'avait employé le prince, merlin baissa le regard et s'empêchant de pleurer. Il savait cet nuit sera oublier ou alors mépriser par Arthur, mais il avait espéré comme dans un rêve se réveiller dans ses bras, l'entendre se déclarer a son tour, un réveil comme il en a tant rêvé avec son prince. Voyant la lueur de dégout dans les yeux bleus, il se leva s'habilla, se dirigea vers la porte, et avant de l'ouvrir le prince le stoppa en l'attrapant l'avant bras et d'une voix froide et sans appel, il lui dit Cette nuit n'a pas eu lieu, il ne s'est rien passé, si tu racontes ceci a qui que ce soit, je me ferais un plaisir de t'enfermer jusqu'à en crever, suis claire merlin ? il avait les yeux sortants des orbites, son ton froid, serrant encore plus sa poigne sur son avant bras au fil du discours. Merlin avait le cœur en miette, il a toujours traité Arthur de crétin royal, mais il ne le savait pas cruel, et aussi démunit de sentiment. Vous n'avez pas a vous en faire sir, je ne comptais le dire a qui que ce soit. Puisque j'en suis la, je vous aime Arthur, je vous aime tellement a en perdre la tete. Pour moi vous êtes brave, courageux, toujours près a aider votre prochain, même contre l'avis de votre père. Mais je viens de me rendre compte que je me suis trompée sur toute la ligne, je ne m'attendais pas a de l'amour, mais de la compensation, non pour vous je suis juste un serviteur, parce que vous ne pouvez vous débrouiller seul, je vous félicite sir, le crétin royal est passé au grade supérieur, il est devenu un homme cruel, sans compensions, sans sentiments. Vous êtes devenu comme votre père. Merlin avait mal, sans respiration était coupé, ses jambes étaient lourdes, sa tete tournait s'empêchant de pleurer durant tout le discours, tete baissée, il se dégagea du bras du prince et sortit de la chambre, il s'efforça a marché jusque dans sa chambre enfin plutôt en rampant sur les murs du château, menaçant de s'évanouir. Arrivé dans sa chambre, dos a la porte, il glissa tout le long de celle-ci, ne pouvant plus s'empêché de pleurer. Fin du flash back[Chapter 3] Merlin n'avait pas changé, il avait laissé poussé ses cheveux mais laissa son éternel foulard rouge autour du cou. Quand Arthur croisa le regard, il se heurta avec un regard de froideur et de haine. Ne le supportant pas, il détourna le regard tout en baissant la tête. Il t avait dans son regard de le tristesse et détresse. Tous ceux présents observaient le roi et le sorcier sans comprendre. Mais une vois le sorti de sa stupeur Merlin c'est bien toi ? tournant la tête il rencontra le regard brumeux près a fondre en larmes de Gaius. Cet homme qu'il considérait comme un père. Il était parti sans lui donner, mais s'il ne pouvait pas risquer qu'on découvre son secret. Bonsoir Gaius. Sa voix donna des frissons au roi jusqu'au plus profond de son âme. Cette l'avait tellement manqué. Il savait que si Merlin était parti a cause de lui. Je te croyais mort … Cela aurait toujours été le cas si ce petit chenapan ne m'avait pas emmené ici. Il avait dit cela avec une tel désinvolture. Le petit garcon ayant entendu ce que son père venait de dire se sentit mal se disant que son père allait l'en vouloir. Je suis désolé papa. Il tremblait, son père approcha et le pris dans ses bras. Je ne t'en veux pas mon ange, tu as voulu bien faire j'en suis conscient. Mais quand je te dis tout va bien c'est que tout va bien. Je n'oserais jamais te laisser tout seul. Promis ? Promis mon grand. Maintenant on rentre a la maison. il posa son fils au sol le prenant la main. Et pour la première fois depuis que Merlin était apparu le roi parla Reste. Arthur avait dit ce mot avec tellement de détresse et tristesse dans sa voix, ses yeux étaient larmoyants. Merlin qui l'avait toujours regardé avec de la douceur et de l'insolence et la il y avait que de la haine. Je t'en prie reste. Tous les chevaliers présent étaient abasourdis et regardait le roi avec les yeux ronds. Ils ne savaient comment mais ils étaient maintenant persuader que le roi y été pour quelque chose dans la disparation de celui-ci. Le regard de merlin se figea malgré toute la haine qu'il y avait il n'arrivait pas a y croire le roi était sur le point de pleurer. Il n'était pas le seul d'ailleurs. Tellement de questions se bousculaient dans sa tête qu'il ne se rendit pas compte que son fils tirait sur son vêtement pour attirer son attention Papa qui es ? demanda le garçon qui fixait le roi d'une étrange façon. C'est … Merlin ne savait comment présenter Arthur a son fils. Sans réponse de son père le petit sorti de la boule de protection et se dirigea vers le roi. Merlin paniqua tenta d'attraper son fils qui se dirigea vers son autre père. Il ne fallait que Arthur le regarde de près il risquait de se douter de quelque chose. Bonjour, je m'appelle Lucas. Reprenant ses esprits le roi détailla le garçon devant lui, il avait un familier, une tête blonde, des yeux bleus, le nez finement dessiné, les lèvres roses, il lui ressemblait a quelqu'un mais a qui la était a question. Agacé qu'une autre de ses questions reste sans réponse, il continua Et vous ? qui êtes vous ? pourquoi regardez-vous mon père ainsi ? sortant de ses pensées il consentit enfin a répondre avec une voix hésitante. Je suis le roi Arthur de camelot. waouh, vous êtes le roi Arthur, celui qui a restauré la magie, Lucas regardait le roi avec des yeux d'émerveillements, sa grand-mère Hunith lui avait raconté l'histoire de camelot. A camelot vivait un roi et sa reine, mais la reine mourut en donnant naissance a son fils par magie. Le chagrin ayant assombrit le roi il interdit la magie a camelot et comme ca a condamné tous ceux qu'ils soupçonnaient. Le fils du roi le prince en grandissant hait lui aussi la magie mais après que le roi fut tué lors d'un combat, le prince monta le trône et a l'étonnement de tout le monde retira la loi de son pour ainsi restaurer la magie. Oui, répondit Arthur qui avait maintenant un sourire. Et ton père est mon ami finit il sa phrase en regardant merlin, qui lui a cette phrase commençait a bouillir de rage. Son ami. Lui qui la toujours traité comme un moins que rien, comme un esclave, comme de la merde de cheval, a toujours lui prendre pour cible pour ses entrainements, le mettait au pilori juste parce qu'il est de mauvaise humeur. Mais il se calma quand son prit se dirigea vers lui. C'est vrai papa, tu es l'ami du roi Arthur ? il regarda son fils qui était tout excité de savoir que son père connaissait le célèbre roi Arthur. Non j'étais son esclave. Tout en regardant le roi dans les yeux il sortit cette phrase avec lassitude. Mais le regard de son fils de voila par de la déception et de la tristesse, et il rectifia . Enfin j'étais son serviteur, mais pas son ami. Maintenant nous devons rentrer ta grand-mère nous attend. Merlin regardait son fils avec douceur, et un sourire hognait son visage. le cœur du roi chuta dans les profondeurs de la tristesse. Ce tableau était ce qu'il cherchait depuis longtemps. Arthur avait depuis longtemps renoncé a l'amour. Flash back il regarda merlin sortir de sa chambre complètement anéanti. Merlin l'aimait lui certes mais pas une raison de se comporter une jeune fille vierge. Cea lui passera après tout il a couché avec moi il devrait être content. A quoi il s'attendait, de toute façon, cela m'importe peu. Les jours qui suivirent, le comportement et le regard de merlin envers lui avaient changé du tout au tout. Il ne le répondait plus avec sarcasme. Il était poli et respectueux, ceux qui commençait par l'agacé. Merlin ne l'adressait la parole que pour lui prévenir des choses importantes. Mais ils parlaient, et son regard était doux pour les autres sauf pour lui. Arthur regardait et cherchait merlin des yeux a chaque sans s'en rendre compte. Sa mauvaise humeur augmentait, tant il délaissa les jeunes avec qui il flirtait. Mais il apprit la disparition de merlin son cœur fit un bond dans sa poitrine. Sans l'accord de son père, il déploya quelques chevaliers qui patient a sa recherche pendant des jours. Il fallait qu'il le retrouve qu'il lui dise. Mais sans succès alors tous les jours sa tristesse se voyait inquiétant même son père. Lancelot qui vit cela se dit qu'il était tant de le mettre au courant. Lancelot lui appris que si merlin ne le souhaite pas, on ne le retrouverait pas. Arthur ne comprenait pas jusqu'à qu'il lui dise que merlin était un sorcier. Alors une idée lui vint s'il devient roi et restaurait la magie peut être un jour, reviendra t'il. Oui il en était sur. Fin du flash back En sortant des ses souvenirs, il regardait Merlin qui commençait son incantation, son visage se figea sur lucas Quel âge as-tu ? J'ai 5ans. Celui faisait 5ans que merlin avait disparut. Es qu'il s'était entiché d'une femme, qui lui a fait un enfant ? es pour cela qu'il avait disparut ? merlin était il parti pour elle ? il voulait savoir. Comment s'appelle ta maman continua le roi sur un ton sérieux. Lucas savait qu'il ne devait pas répondre, son père le lui avait interdit. Mais la c'était le roi Arthur alors il le fit Je n'ai pas de maman. J'ai juste mon papa et grand-mère Hunith. a cette phrase, merlin réagit et mit sa main sur la bouche de son fils qui le regarda avec air désolé, mais il ne fit pas attention et continue l'incantation et ils disparurent. Sans crier gare. Merlin avait peur que les questions fusent et qu'ils finissent par comprendre.[Chapter 4] Arthur regardait l'endroit ou merlin et son fils avaient disparus, laissant derrière eux un écran un fin écran de fumée. Ils voulaient hurler sa poitrine était compressé et lui faisait mal. A peine venait t'il de découvrir que celui qu'il croyait mort est vivant voila que celui disparaît encore une fois. Les chevaliers qui regardaient le roi n'osant prononcer un mot, mais se posaient des questions. Près du roi Gaius était en pleine réflexion, le petit avait dit grand mère Hunith, et il n'était pas le seul a se faire cette réflexion. Lancelot et Gauvain aussi se demandaient pourquoi la mère de celui-ci avait menti. Majesté s'avança alors vers lui Lancelot. Il est vivant . Avait dit le roi avec une voix tremblante, et des yeux larmoyants. Voyant cela, le chevalier s'empressa de faire sortir tous les chevaliers a l'exception de Gaius, Gauvain. Arthur appela Gaius. Le roi n'avait pleuré quand son père était mort, et merlin apparaît celui pleure. Il y avait anguille sous roche, et le roi savait pourquoi. Se disaient ceux près de lui. Sire, que se passe-t-il ? je suis sur et certain que vous le savez pourquoi il est parti. Le roi se retourna vers eux, lasse et les yeux pleins de larmes, qu'il essuya et passa une main dans ses cheveux. Il hésita mais les raconta toute l'histoire jusqu'à la recherche de celui-ci. Ces trois derniers se regardèrent comme ci une lumière venait de s'allumer au dessus de leur tête. Si le roi n'avait pas encore compris eux par contre si. Cet enfant, il y avait plus aucun doute, était celui du roi et du sorcier. Je l'ai vu avec ce fils que j'aurais voulu tellement avoir, une famille que je désire tant. Disait le roi avec une telle tristesse que le médecin prit la parole. Arthur avez-vous regardé cet enfant ? ne vous ressemble t'il pas a quelqu'un ? C'est celui de merlin et je ne sais qu'elle paysanne. Gronda sa voix pleine amertume. Gaius se dit que merlin avait eu toujours raison de le nommé crétin royal et soupira, si le roi ne voulait voir l'évidence, alors il allait connaitre le fameux de cette histoire. Attendez, lancelot je croyais que Hunith t'avais dit qu'elle ne savait pas ou se trouvait merlin. Le roi se tourna vers son chevalier en l'interrogeant des yeux. Le petit a dit qu'il n'avait que merlin et sa grand-mère Hunith. Ca veut dire qu'elle est surement au courant. Mais j'imagine qu'elle t'a mentit quand tu es allé la voir disait il pensivement tout en regardant lancelot. Elle était au courant pourquoi ne te l'avoir dit continua Arthur vers lancelot. Puis Gaius prit la parole. Je crois tout simplement que Merlin le lui a interdit avait il dit avec tristesse que son protégé celui qui était comme un fils pour lui ne lui avait pas fait confiance pour une chose aussi importante. Arthur ne voulant s'éterniser, il voulait être seul, pour voir claire, alors les proposa a tous de reprendre cette discussion le lendemain après du repos. Du repos c'était vite dit a peine était il dans sa chambre laissa sa colère s'exprimer. Il détruisait tout autour de lui. Son carnage terminé, il s'assit sur son lit, et se dit que si merlin avait toujours était son serviteur il lui aurait dit sa façon de penser en voyant l'était de la chambre qu'il devrait ranger et un micro sourire apparu sur son visage, cette fois c'est en exprima sa tristesse qu'il se mit a pleurer. La nuit se passa ainsi pour le roi resté éveillé a se remémorer ces instants peu banales avec son ancien serviteur, son insolence qu'il ne pouvait supporter et pourtant il le gardait près de lui. De tant a autre il se mettait a rire tous seul dans cette chambre ou il avait perdu celui qu'il l'aimait, parce que âpres cette nuit la tout avait changé, et tout était entièrement sa faute. Le matin arriva très lentement au gout du roi qui voulait absolument parlé au médecin. Alors dès les premières lueurs du jour, il se la et se dirigea vers l'appartement de Gaius, qui lui était debout a faire les cents pas. Perdu dans ses pensées il n'entendit pas le roi cogné a sa porte pour prévenir de sa présence. Mais celui-ci ne le remarqua pas. Il s'avança et posa sa main sur son épaule, qui le fit sursauter. Sir, je ne vous ai pas entendu entrer dit le médecin avec un souffle court qui fit sourire le roi. Oui je l'ai remarqué. Vous avez l'air pensif mon ami, tout comme moi d'ailleurs dit Arthur en baissant la tête. La soirée d'hier nous a tous mis en émotions . Je n'ai pu dormir de la nuit. Gaius regardait le roi avec curiosité, ils étaient seuls pourquoi ne pas tenter de lui soutirer des informations. Arthur, vous savez que vous pouvez tout me dire, vous pouvez me faire confiance . Gaius avait dit cela avec un tel sérieux qui surprit le roi. Ou voulez vous en venir Gaius ? Arthur n'était pas dupe il savait que le médecin était très proche de merlin et que celui-ci voulait savoir. J'ai vu le regard qu'il vous lançait hier soir. Un regard de mépris, de haine, merlin vous admirait, alors comprenez la surprise quand j'ai vu cela. Le roi s'était figé. Non il n'avait pas peur de raconter cette histoire mais que le médecin l'en veule et le juge. Vous pouvez me faire confiance répéta t'il. il fallait qu'il sache, il pourrait dormir si cette énigme n'était pas résolue. Vous vous répétez mon ami avec un sourire triste. Parce que je le sais et le sens que vous connaissez la raison pour laquelle il est parti. Soupirant encore une fois le roi alla s'asseoir sur une des chaises du bureau et regarda le médecin en lui montrant avec les yeux la chaise près de lui. Je ne vous demanderai qu'une chose de ne pas me juger trop vite mon ami. Le roi se mit a raconter la nuit passé avec merlin et Gaius comprenait mieux le comportement de ce dernier après cette soirée d'anniversaire. Es que cet enfant est vraiment… non ne tirer trop vite des conclusions. Merci de m'avoir parlé Arthur, mais si vous le permettez je vais aller voir Hunith pur en savoir plus du pourquoi merlin est parti parce que j'en suis sur que vous n'êtes pas le seul responsable continua Gaius voyons que le roi allait répliquer sur sa culpabilité. Comment cela je ne suis pas le seul responsable ? il ne voyait pas très ou le médecin voulait en venir. Voyons sir, après cette il aurait pu partir tout de suite, cela ne s'est fait que 12semaines plus tard pourquoi avoir attendu tout ce temps alors qu'il vous aimait ? ce n'est pas logique. Maintenant a y pensé Gaius avait raison pourquoi avait t'il attendu si longtemps pour s'en aller. Je vais demander a lancelot et Gauvain de vous accompagné ce sera plus prudent. il ne voulait prendre aucun risque s'il avait les réponses qu'ils se posaient merlin pourrait lui demander de garder cela secret sans rien lui dire en retour. Non Arthur j'ai peur qu'il se braque s'il voie les autres. J'insiste mon ami au moins l'un d'entre eux. Le médecin n'eut pas le choix, du moins le roi n'eut lui en laissait pas. Il accepta et demanda a lancelot de l'accompagner.[Chapter 5] pour commencer, je tiens a m'excuser pour ce retard pour ceux qui me suivent, je me suis fait opérée et je suis désolée de ne pas vous avoir prévenue Ne voulant perdre de temps, ils se mirent en chemin dans l'après midi. Le chemin jusqu'à Ealdor était long, parsemé d'embûches donc Lancelot avait convaincu le médecin de demander aussi a Gauvain d'y aller avec eux. Ils étaient partis depuis deux jours quand ils virent la ville au lion et soupirèrent d'un accord commun. En effet ils avaient subit des attaques de voleurs qui les avaient tenu une embuscade et se sont sortis grâce au courage des deux chevaliers. Regardant la ville au loin, ils craignaient ce qu'ils allaient apprendre, ils avaient un mauvais pressentiment. Alors ils se mirent au galop mauvais pressentiments ou pas, il voulait voir merlin et c'était suffisant. Devant les portes de la ville qui étaient qui étaient fermés. Et du haut de celle-ci apparut un garde demanda pourquoi voulait il entrer, mais en reconnaissant Gaius, il les laissa entrer en demandant a celui de dire bonjour a Hunith ce qu'il accepta. Sur leur chemin ils virent sur une petite montagne, une maison perchée, petite et modeste. Et tandis qu'ils avançaient, ils entendirent des rires. Comme hypnotisés, ils avancèrent a petits pas en se rapprochant des rires. Derrière la cabane, Hunith chatouillait Lucas. Le petit garçon pour s'amuser avait asperger sa grand-mère d'eau et faisait cela pour le punir. Lucas tout en rigolant la suppliait d'arrêter de le torturer. Elle s'arrêta en voyant qu'il commençait a avoir du mal a respirer. Il s'allongea sur l'herbe près d'elle et regardait le ciel bleu tout en reprenant son souffle. Soudain Hunith se figea. Le garçon vu sa grand-mère se tendre et suivit son regard quant il vit le médecin et les chevaliers. En signe de protection, elle mit Lucas derrière elle. Mais celui-ci l'échappa et se dirigea vers eux. Mais je vous reconnais, vous étiez avec e roi Arthur la fois dernière. Gaius le sourit et acquiesça tout comme les deux autres. Hunith s'avança, qu'es que son petit fils racontait, et quand es qu'il est allé a camelot. Et encore une fois mis le garçon derrière elle. Hunith Gaius, que fais tu ici accompagné des chevaliers de camelot ? le nom de camelot sonnait comme avec rage dans sa bouche. Mais Gaius ne voulait pas aller par quatre chemins avec elle. Il la connaissait et son caractère, elle avait la réputation de ne pas mâcher ses mots. Donc il devait aller droit au but. Nous cherchons Merlin, et a voir son fils avec toi, j'en déduis qu'il est ici aussi. Comprenant que cela ne servait a rien de nier, elle les invita a se reposer dans la maison avec une collation et des boissons. Les regardant se restaurer, une question lui brulait les lèvres. Comment savaient ils ou trouver son fils. Mais en bon hôte elle attendit que ceux-ci terminent leurs repas. Alors Gaius comment saviez vous ou le trouvez ? surpris il raconta a celle-ci l'apparition de Merlin et Lucas dans la grande salle du trône. Vous êtes venus de vous-même ou c'est le roi qui vous envoie ? La décision vient de moi et le ri a décidé de m'envoyer les chevaliers pour les voleurs. Il ne manque d'audace ce sale morveux. Nous parlons du roi dame Hunith, répliqua lancelot. Je me fiche. Roi ou pas ce qu'il a fait a mon fils est inacceptable. Si tu nous racontais l'histoire je te prie. Arthur était dévasté après le passage inattendu de merlin. Je ne l'ai vu ainsi que il a appris sa disparition. Ce n'est que justice, mon fils a assez souffert par sa faute. Flash back Hunith venait de se remplir la pense et sortit prendre de l'air en se demandant ce qu'elle devait faire aujourd'hui. Elle regarda le ciel comme a son habitude en espérant que les pensées d'amour qu'elle a pour son fils atteignent celui-ci. Sourire aux lèvres, il prit son panier se dirigeant vers le marché. Mais en traversant la foret, elle vu une ombre au sol. Se disant tout en se rapprochant qu'elle prend les mauvaises habitudes de son fils. Regardant attentivement elle vit un corps jetant son panier et courut pour voir la personne allait bien malgré les apparences. Elle le tourna et les yeux écarquillés, elle commença a crier son nom car la personne n'était que son fils Merlin. Apres être partie chercher de l'aide, et nettoyer soigné celui-ci, elle partit faire le repas au cas s'il aurait faim. Mais malheureusement pour elle, merlin ne se réveilla que deux jours plus tard. Merlin ouvrit les yeux, regardant de gauche a droite, il ne connaissant que trop bien cet endroit il y a grandit. Sa tête tambourinait, mais il se leva tout de même, c'est a cet instant que sa mère entra dans la chambre et fonça sur lui comme une furie destructrice qui le fit tomber sur lit de nouveau. Avec un cri de douleur, il serra plus fort sa mère les larmes plein les yeux. S'en rendant compte, elle se leva et le regarda, reniflant il prit la main de sa mère et la posa sur son ventre et de nouveau les larmes recommencèrent a couler. Hunith n'avait pas besoin de mots pour comprendre ce que son fils essayait de lui dire. Qu'es qui s'est passé merlin ? Je ne resterai qu'un serviteur, un moins que rien a ses yeux. Fin du flash back Elle arrêta son récit pour voir leurs réactions. Elle souffla la haine qu'elle avait pour le roi Arthur n'égalait en rien l'amour qu'elle avait pour son fils et son petit fils. Donc Lucas est bien le fils du roi. Non dit-elle avec conviction et colère. Lucas est le fils de Merlin. Ce garçon a vécu des choses horribles pendant la grossesse. Savez vous ce que cela peut faire de se retrouver enceint étant un homme et que l'homme qui vous a fait cela vous a traite de… peu importe. Merlin a assez souffert par sa faute, même si maintenant le bonheur qu'es son fils lui va, il a toujours autant mal parce qu'il l'aime et lui en veux. Je l'ai vu pleuré toutes les nuits, prié aux dieux en leur demandant que son fils ne doit pas ressembler a Arthur. Elle pleurait ouvertement devant eux et d'un coup se leva Merlin ne va pas tarder a arrivé et s'il trouve des chevaliers de camelot ici, cela ne va lui plaire. Qu'es qui ne va pas me plaire ? demanda une voix qui fit tourné tout le monde la tête, merlin dos tourné a eux essayer de rentrer son gros sac qui ne passait pas la porte, agacé, il souffla sur sa mèche devant ses yeux et laissa tomber. Mère je suis épuisé, ne voudriez pas m'aider ? Bonjour, merlin, ta blessure va mieux je vois. Merlin e retourna sans surprise. Gaius, vous êtes si prévisible. Dit-il avec le sourire en s'avançant pour le prendre dans les bras. Donc tu t'attendais a ce qu'ont viennent mon ami demanda soupçonne Lancelot. merlin savait qu'en disant le nom de sa mère Gaius allait faire tout le possible s'y rendre mais il ne s'attendait pas a ce que ses deux amis soient la eux aussi. On va dire cela répondit il avec une accolade. Je vois qu'on m'oublie. Dit Gauvain avec une moue boudeuse en enlaçant a son tour merlin. c'est Arthur qui vous envoie j'imagine? demanda merlin une voix amer que ne lui connaissait pas ses amis. il voulait savoir pourquoi tu as disparu dit Lancelot quand des explosions retentit dans toute la maison, surprenant tout le monde. merlin était en colère mais se calma quand il entendit des petits arriver. papa courait l'enfant tu sais il ya des chevaliers de camelot tu crois que le roi va venir lui aussi hein papa? Lucas ne court pas dans la maison tu risques de te faire mal et je crois que kilargard veut te voir et surtout ne t'éloigne pas. l'enfant sauta sur place, et courut au dehors. le sourire de merlin s'effaça et se tourna vers ses amis. depuis quand sa majesté le crétin royal se préoccupe t-il d'un simple serviteur? Lancelot sous le choc des paroles de son ami voulut défendre le roi. il était mal au point quand tu as disparu. c'est pour toi qu'il a réhabilité la magie en espérant que tu reviendrais d'habitude merlin appelait Arthur cretin royal sur le coup de rigolade mais la haine qu'il avait senti quand ses paroles lui fit froid dans le dos. mal au point, non moi j'étais mal au point,moi j'ai souffert, lui c'était juste pour sa conscience rien de plus. je ne vais pas vous raconter l'histoire j'imagine que mère la déjà fait. rentrer a camelot maintenant que vous avez vos réponses. et surtout faites en ce que vous voulez parce que Lucas est mon fils et en aucun cas le tien. et j'y veillerais a ce qu'il ne l'approche pas. jamais. ces mots et pleins de rage et de colère que Gauis comprit qu'il n'était pas nécessaire de répliquer ou de discuter. pour le moment il était en colère mais espérons celui ci se radoucira peut être d'ici quelques temps. obéissant aux paroles, ils prirent leurs affaires, s'en allèrent, ils disparurent dans la foret au soleil couchant avec la plus des réponses qu'ils voulaient.[Chapter 6] Cela faisait plusieurs jours ceux-ci étaient parti et le roi n'en dormait plus. Il ne pouvait fermer les yeux sans voir le regard de pure haine que merlin lui lança ce jour. Assis sur le trône il réfléchissait. Qu'avait il fait merlin était non seulement son serviteur mais aussi son ami. Merlin avait un enfant, il était surement marié et ne pensait plus a lui. Toutes ses réflexions lui tordaient le cœur, mais il ne pouvait faire autrement. Merlin avait raison il était devenu comme son père. Un chevalier entra en trombe dans la salle lui sortant de ses pensées morbides. Sire, les seigneurs lancelot, Gauvain et Gaius sont rentrés. Dit leur que je veux les voir immédiatement. Arthur c'était levé et en les attendant impatience ment. Faisant les cent devant son trône ceux-ci arrivèrent. Gaius devant les deux autres vit le roi et son regard plein de questions mais n'osa parler. Mon ami ne me faites pas plus patienter. Nous avons vu et parler a merlin. Le roi balaya les deux autres du regard et plissa les yeux en voyant leurs gènes. Il craignait désormais ce quil le rendait impatient. Je vous écoute dit le roi avec un leger stress. Tout d'abord merlin n'est pas marié et ne l'a jamais été, ensuite…. En hésitant il regarda les deux autres qui ne savaient comment se comporter. Ensuite.. parla le roi coléreux, et agacé par leur gène. Lucas n'a jamais eu de mère. Lucas ? qui es Lucas ? Votre … enfin je veux dire le fils de merlin. Mais Arthur ne fit pas attention a cela. Très bien mais encore ? il est tombé du ciel peut être ? Non majesté, c'est merlin qui l'a porté. Avait-il dit doucement de peur que le roi comprenne. Lancelot, je n'ai nullement envie de rire. Alors je veux la vérité sur … Mais il dit la vérité dit Gaius en coupant la parole au roi. Merlin attendait un enfant quand il a disparu en effet c'était la raison de sa fuite. Vous êtes entrain de me dire que merlin, un homme, attendait un enfant. J'aimerais que vos m'expliquer exactement comment ce miracle a put se produire. Gaius se plaça devant le roi pour lui expliquer la situation. Merlin a toujours était très puissant. En imaginant que l'amour qu'il avait pour son partenaire et sa magie ont du faire se procréer cet enfant. Racontez-moi toute l'histoire s'il vous plait Gaius. Merlin a découvert qu'il était enceint par le dragon et i était 6mois quant il a disparu, tout simplement parce qu'il a paniqué. Et est allé se refugier chez sa mère. Avec appréhension, le roi se racla la gorge Et qui l'autre père de Lucas ? il vit Gaius hésiter mais le supplia du regard. Je ne suis pas sur que vous soyez prêt a l'entendre Arthur. Je n'ai pas paniqué quand vous m'avez dit que merlin a porté son fils lui-même. Je …je crois que je peux supporter cela aussi mon ami. Arthur ne l'avouera jamais mais il tremblait de savoir qu'âpres cette nuit qu'il avait passé avec merlin, après toutes les horreurs qu'il avait dites en son encontre, mais avec l'amour que celui-ci ressentait pour lui, qu'il soit allé voir quelqu'un d'autre. Il fut sortit de ses pensées quand Gaius le répondit. Pardon ? qu'avez vous dit ? Je disais que c'était vous. Arthur avait peur de comprendre, ne se rappelant plus ou ils en été dans la conversation. Moi ? Oui vous êtes le père de Lucas ? enfin son autre père. Sans ménagement Arthur s'écroula sur son trone Il a plutôt bien pris la nouvelle. Pas vrai ? demanda Gauvain en regardant le roi évanouit. Les deux autres le regardèrent en espérant qu'il avait raison. Ils le portèrent pour les appartements de celui-ci. Arthur ouvrit les yeux et regarda de tous les cotés et reconnut ses appartements. Ce rêve était si réel, sourire aux lèvres, en imaginant Lucas et Merlin a ses cotés tos les jours. Depuis la disparition du sorcier Arthur avait mis un point d'honneur de ne vouloir personne d'autre a ses cotés que lui. Même si pour cela, la lignée des Pendragon devait s'éteindre avec lui. Il fallait qu'il voie merlin et le plus vite possible sera le mieux. Se levant précipitamment, il sortit de sa chambre, en arrivant au trône il trouva Gaius discutant avec Gauvain, et Lancelot. Il s'avança et cria aussi fort possible. Vous êtes déjà rentrés, Il faut que je vois merlin. C'est impératif. Ils sursautèrent. Sire, vous allez bien ? demanda Gaius Je vous avais dit qu'il avait bien pris la nouvelle assena Gauvain. Le roi plissa les yeux de quoi parlaient-ils ? Quelle nouvelle ? écoutez j'ai fait un drôle de rêve et je dois absolument voir merlin. Il faut que je lui parle sinon je vais devenir fou. Et vous ?qu'avez-vous appris ? Sire allez vous bien ? nous sommes rentrés il ya de ceux la quelques heures et en vous racontant ce que nous avons appris que vous vous êtes évanouit . abasourdi le roi tomba sur ses genoux. Alors ce n'était pas un reve, j'ai eu un fils avec merlin parla pensivement Arthur avec un sourire aux lèvres. C'était incroyable il avait une famille. Il fallait qu'il les voit. Mais il yavait un problème. Merlin. Non seulement celui-ci ne voudra jamais lui adresser la parole mais il lui défendrait d'approcher son enfant. Il devait trouver une solution et rapidement. Toutes ces années a attendre le sorcier et en prime il avait un fils avec lui. Cet homme qu'il aimait tant. Mais il lui avait fait tellement de mal. L'avez-vous vu ? demanda le roi en les regardant dans les yeux. Ceux-ci voyant la détresse et l souffrance dans les yeux de leur souverain, ne put répondre que d'un signe de tête approbatif. Le roi les observait et voyait le malaise dans leurs yeux. Il baissa la tête de honte. Je l'ai brisé n'es ce pas ?allez y n'hésiter a me briser le cœur dit d'un sourire amer. C'est le médecin qui prit la parole voyant les chevaliers hésiter. Arthur, nous ne connaissons pas toute l'histoire, mais Gaius essayait de trouver les mots pour pouvoir soulager le roi. Enfin je veux dire il va bien, son fils enfin votre fils se porte a merveille. Masi vous devez comprendre que si nous devons vous aidez nous devons avoir toutes les pièces de la carte ( je ne pouvais pas dire puzzle. A cette époque, cela m'étonnerait qu'il ait des puzzles. Mais c'est à vérifier) donc vous devez nous dire ce qu'il s'est passé avant sa disparition. Arthur secoua la tête il ne pouvait pas. Lancelot et Gauvain étaient ses amis, et il ne voulait pas voir le mépris dans leur yeux et encore moins dans ceux de ce qu'il considère comme un parent. Je ne peux pas. La honte m'envahit rien que d'y penser. Personne ne vous jugera sir répliqua lancelot pour le rassurer. Il releva la tête et chercha dans leurs yeux un mensonge mais n'y trouvant pas, il se leva et les demanda de se mettre a l'aise et il commença a raconter toute l'histoire sans omettre aucun détail. Les trois autres comprenaient la réaction de Hunith et de Merlin. Mais n'en tenait pas le roi rigueur. Il avait toujours était un crétin royal comme le sorcier le disait toujours. Merlin était mon ami, mais en me réveillant ce matin la avec toutes ces images de la veille j'ai pris peur en lui disant toutes ces choses affreuses. Je sais bien qu'avec ceux que j'ai faits je suis impardonnable, mais il faut que je le voit. Sinon je deviendrai fou dans ce château . Il se leva et en se dirigeant vers la grande porte, une lumière aveuglante apparut au milieu du trône. Se dissipant ils furent tous surpris de voir Lucas allongé dormant avec les larmes aux yeux. Gaius fut a ses cotés en un éclair. Il rassura les deux autres en disant qu'il était juste endormi. Mais le roi paniqua. Il savait que son fils tenait de merlin en se qu'il concernait la magie, mais comment se faisait til qu'il avait les larmes aux yeux. Il devait faire un rêve, sur camelot, et sa magie l'a ramené ici. C'est arrivé quelques fois a merlin. Rassuré le roi porta son fils voulant le conduire a son lit mais le sorcier apparut et glapit en voyant Lucas dans les bras d'Arthur. Mais celui-ci voyant la panique dans les yeux de merlin s'avança vers lui et lui remis l'enfant encore endormi dans ses bras. Sans le regarder dans les yeux, merlin prit son fils et se préparait a partir mais Gaius l'appela Cela t'arrivait aussi quelques fois de disparaitre en plein sommeil, mais cela ne t'arrivait que quand tu étais contrarié ou en colère. Qu'es qui s'est passé ? le sorcier se tourna vers le médecin, et soupira. Apres que vous ne soyez parti il y a quelques jours, Lucas commença a me poser des questions sur sa mère. Dit-il en regardant Arthur dans les yeux. Il n'est pas au courant pour moi enfin pour nous ? demanda le roi d'une petite voix ne voulant s'attirer les foudres et la haine du sorcier. Pour quoi le serait t'il ? et il ya pas de nous répliqua avec force merlin. Mais se calma aussi vite en s'excusant ce qui surprit le roi et le médecin. Non je ne lui ai jamais parlé de vous. Il n'a pas besoin de savoir même si la magie n'est plus interdite. Je l'ai fait pour toi, en espérant que tu reviennes, que tu vois a quel point je m'en veux pour ce que je t'avais fais et dis. Comme c'est touchant de votre part riait ironiquement le sorcier. Votre serviteur vous manquait ? mais je suis sur que vous avez trouvé un autre valet après tout, vous répétiez tout le temps que je suis incompétent. Non j'attendais mon ami. Mais tout a coup les yeux de merlin se dorere et tous les objets dans la salle les volaient tout autour. Arthur comprit que c'est sa phrase qui avait provoqué cette réaction mais il continua a parler. Je t'attendais toi, si tu savais comme je m'en suis voulu de t'avoir blessé de t'avoir humilié. Mais quand tu as disparu ces cinq dernières années ont été les pire de toutes ma vie. Et tu sais pourquoi parce que je me suis rendu compte que je t'aimais comme un fou. Je sais c'est trop facile. Mais il faut que tu comprennes que toutes ces années c'est toi que j'attendais. Et je ne remercierais assez jamais la magie de t'avoir ramené de nouveau a moi. Il avait fini son discours en étant a genoux devant merlin qui était complètement sous le choc. Le roi maintenant debout, leva sa main et caressa les cheveux de Lucas avec un sourire béat. Et je n'arrive toujours pas a croire que j'ai eu… non nous avons un fils. Je ne te demande rien enfin si. Juste qu'il sache qui je suis. Et rien d'autre vu la haine que tu as pour moi je ne me fais d'illusion. Tous les objets tombèrent faisant un bruit monstre. Toujours sous le choc, merlin analysait toutes les informations qu'il venait d'enregistrer. Il voulait s'en aller loin d'ici ais ses jambes ne l'obéissaient. Il était comme statufier n'arrivant plus a bouger, mais continua a regarder Arthur qui lui n'avait d'yeux que pour son fils. Merlin se réveillant quand celui-ci dévia sa main pour caresser ses joues et fit quelques pas en arrière en disparaissant sans dire un mot.[Chapter 7] Il reviendra, je pense qu'il a besoin de réfléchir a vos paroles le rassura le médecin. Non il ne me pardonnera jamais. Et je sais que tout ceci est ma faute mais j'avais espérer quand lui disant ce que je ressentais, en m'excusant, il me … peu importe. Je n'ai plus le droit d'espérer quelque chose venant de lui. Mais je voudrais voir mon fils. Je suis navrée Arthur, mais cet enfant n'est pas votre répliqua le médecin d'un ton doucereux. Ce qui le valut la colère du roi qui se retourna et s'avança vers lui avec des yeux durs. Comment cela pas le mien ? les deux autres chevaliers s'écartèrent ne voulant intervenir. Mais Gaius restait calme. Calmez vous Arthur et laisse moi terminer je vous prie. Pour le moment cet enfant est a Merlin, pas le votre. Quand et si il décide de vous laissez reconnaitre le petit a ce moment la, il sera aussi le votre. Ce n'est pas encore le cas. Les paroles de Gaius eurent bon de calmer le roi qui devait bien avouer qu'il avait raison. Voyant le désarroi ru roi face a son discours le médecin tenait a le rassurer. Merlin vous aime, Arthur leva brusquement la tète et le regarda comme pour dire « êtes vous devenu fou ? » ce qui amena un rire a ses lèvres. C'est pourtant évident, mais vous vous préoccupé tellement du fait qu'il doive vous pardonner que vous ne voyez pas la détresse dans ses yeux. Et maintenant que vous lui avez dit il ne tardera pas a revenir. Laissez-lui juste le temps pour l'assimiler. Je l'espère mais j'attendrai. Ce n'est pas tout mais toutes ces émotions creusent l'appétit. Dit le roi d'un ton anormalement joyeux. Les paroles du médecin le donnaient de l'espoir. Il était persuadé, non il était sur que son sorcier e reviendrait ou sinon il irait le chercher. Traversant la salle le sourire aux lèvres, le roi ne se rendit pas compte les trois autres le regardaient avec étonnement. Son brusque changement d'humeur inquiéta Lancelot et Gauvain. Gaius se dit qu'il avait bien fit son boulot. Que vient-il de se passer ? lancelot posa cette question dans un murmure que seul son ami et le médecin entendu. Le roi a juste de nouveau un peu d'espoir et je crois bientôt il va y avoir un mariage pourquoi pas. Souriait le médecin en suivant le roi pour se restaurer. De son coté le sorcier réapparut dan la chambre de son fils et le recoucha. Il regarda son fils dormir. Cela devait finir par arriver. Mais comment Lucas le prendrait quand il saura la vérité. Puis ses pensées revinrent sur les paroles d'Arthur. Il l'aimait. Non il ne devait pas se l'essayer attendrir, ni céder. Mais combien de fois a t'il imaginer vivre avec Lucas et Arthur ? Tellement de fois qu'il n'en compte plus. D'abord Lucas doit apprendre la vérité sur ses origines. Oui il lui dira la vérité dès le soleil levé. Il souffla cela allait être difficile aussi bien pour lui que pour son fils. L'aube arriva, merlin ne se rendit compte de cela que quand il fut sorti de ses pensées par son fils qui le sauta dessus avec des cris de joie. Souriant a son fils, il se prêta a son jeu et se mit a le chatouiller. Des cris et des rires s'élevèrent dans la maison réveillant Hunith qui sourire aux lèvres se levant en se demandant ce que les deux hommes de sa vie avait encore inventé ce matin. Epuisés par les rires, mer lin et Lucas étaient allongés sur le lit reprenant leur souffle. L'occasion de lui parler est venu mais étonnamment ce n'est pas merlin qui prit la parole. Papa, pourquoi je n'ai pas de maman ? demanda l'enfant en regardant son père qui s'était redressé. Merlin souffla en se donnant du courage. Il prit Lucas sur ses genoux Parce que tu n'as pas de maman mon ange. Je vais te raconter une histoire et je veux que tu m'écoutes attentivement, parce que cet histoire c'est la notre. Lucas acquiesça et comme son père lui dit, il écoutait. Quand merlin finit de lui conter l'histoire, il regarda son fils espérant qu'il est compris. Malheureusement pour Lucas qui avait compris, descendit des genoux de son père, et s'écarta. Pourquoi tu me prends toujours pour un enfant ? pourquoi c'est maintenant que tu me le dit ? Tout simplement, tu n'es encore qu'un enfant, et ensuite j'avais peur mon ange. Tu crois que je peux aller le voir ? Lucas était tout excité. Et comment comptes-tu faire cela ? demanda Merlin avec amusement. Avec de la magie, kilgharah le dragon m'apprend a faire de la magie. Merlin jura dans sa barbe, il allait avoir une sérieuse discussion avec ce fourbe de dragon. Non je t'interdis d'utiliser la magie de te transporter, cela peut être dangereux. Et si tu veux le voir, nous irons le voir mais dans quelques jours d'accord mon ange, d'ici la soit patient. Patient c'est tellement facile en effet merlin ne voulut qu'une chose retourné a camelot, il en mourrait d'envie. Mais il ne voulait surtout pas que le roi le sache. Les jours passaient et le sorcier passait ses nuits les yeux ouverts. Merlin y pensait tous les jours, espérant que c'est son fils qui en parlerai ou lui demanderai le premier a aller a camelot. Ce matin la comme depuis quelques jours merlin ne dormit pas de la nuit. Regardant le plafond, son fils déboula comme a son habitude, et le sauta dessus faisant sourire son père. Alors on y va hein papa ? ne s'y attendant pas, il hésita, il ne fallait pas que son fils sente qu'il était lui aussi impatient. Agissant comme une fatalité, il acquiesça et promit qu'ils se mettraient en route ^pour camelot dès le lendemain a la grande joie du petit et du père même s'il le montrait pas. Et dès le lendemain ils se mirent en route, mais en chemin Lucas fatigué de marcher fit appel au dragon au grand désespoir du père qui n'eut pas le choix que de se faire conduire a camelot par le dragon. Le voyage paru long au sorcier entre les discussions et les disputes de son et du dragon. Apercevant de loin camelot il souffla mais demanda au dragon de les déposer près de foret à l' abri des regards ce que le dragon fit. Lucas demanda au dragon s'il pouvait de nouveau venir les chercher mais merlin s'y opposa disant que celui-ci n'était un moyen de transport. Merlin. Celui-ci se retourna et vit le roi et quelques chevaliers qui l'escortaient. Arthur regardait le dragon avec crainte, mais se rassura quand celui-ci s'envola, Lucas pour se rassurer serra la main de son père. Merlin regarda son fils et le mit derrière lui au cas ou tout cela tournerai mal. Je ne voulais pas vous faire peur, mes éclaireurs m'ont informé qu'un dragon se dirigeait vers camelot donc nous voila. Je ne m'attendais pas a te voir enfin …a vous voir. Le cœur du roi bondissait dans sa poitrine. Si merlin et leur fils était la, cela voulait surement dire que… non il ne fallait pas qu'il se fasse des idées. Il essaya de ne pas se sentir anxieux. Il regardait merlin, qui lui ne parlait toujours pas. Arthur descendit de cheval et s'avança vers merlin et son fils. Celui-ci prit peur et fit un pas en arrière ce qui stoppa la marche d'Arthur. Ca me fait plaisir de te voir. Dit Arthur avec un micro sourire. Mais merlin ne se détendit pas. Au contraire lui qui était si impatient de le revoir après cette magnifique déclaration qu'il avait tant espérer, se voyait paralysé sur place incapable de bouger. J'imagine que vous êtes fatigués ou que vous ayez faim. Arthur essaya de débloquer la situation pour faire parler merlin. Mais celui-ci était toujours tétaniser et son fils le regardait sans comprendre. Il tira sur la manche de son père pour le réveiller. Merlin détourna son regard du roi et regarda Lucas . Tu te rappelles l'histoire que je t'ai racontée. Merlin parlait assez fort pour qu'Arthur entende. Oui papa, que grâce a la magie c'est toi ma maman. Oui je suis fière de toi ce qui amena un large sourire sur le visage. Arthur écoutait la conversation comme tous les chevaliers qui l'accompagnait. Prenant son courage a deux mains, il se lanca. Oui je suis comme ta maman. Mais sans un papa, la maman ne peut pas avoir de bébé. Donc toi tu as un papa. Disant cela merlin regarda Arthur avec une telle douceur qui étonna ce dernier. Et c'est qui mon papa ? c'est pour cela qu'on est a camelot pas vrai ? Oui Lucas je te présente ton autre papa dit il en se retournant vers Arthur. La stupéfaction était totale. Les chevaliers n'osaient faire un geste de peur que le roi leur demande de s'en aller. Non ils voulaient assister a ses retrouvailles spéciales. Puis ils entendirent des pas précipiter et merlin vit arriver Gaius et le fit un sourire. Lucas méfiant s'avança vers son autre père et se planta devant lui. Papa dit que tu es mon père, mais ca ne peut être vrai. Toi tu es le roi Arthur. Je ne peux pas être ton fils. Lucas parla sans s'arrêter. Jamais son papa ne lui avait dit que père était un roi dans son histoire. Si son autre père était un roi cela faisait de lui un prince et ca il voulait en être sur avant de se réjouir. Et pourquoi, je ne pourrai pas être ton père ? demanda Arthur après s'être remis du choc de sa paternité dévoilé. Papa m'a raconté une histoire sur mon deuxième père sans jamais me dire que c'était toi. Tu veux bien me la raconter s'il te plait demanda Arthur intrigué par la fameuse histoire qui aidait son fils a bien prendre la chose. papa m'a dit qu'en arrivant a camelot il est tombé amoureux d'un prince pour qui il travaillait. mais le prince n'était pas amoureux de lui. mais qu'un soir ils se sont aimés au point que papa appris le dragon j'étais dans son ventre alors il est parti de camelot sans le dire au prince. Arthur mis un genou au sol devant Lucas essaya d'assimiler que merlin est tombé amoureux de lui bien avant cette nuit la. avant d'etre un roi, j'étais un prince le savais tu? non. alors pourquoi n'aimais tu pas mon papa? parce qu'il était un serviteur? merlin voulut intervenir, mais Arthur le regarda avec une intensité qui le stoppa. ton papa était mon ami. et quand il m'a dit qu'il m'aimait j'ai pris peur et je lui ai dites des méchantes c'est pour cela qu'il est parti.[Chapter 8] Au milieu de foret se produisait un rassemblement inhabituel. Entouré par ses chevaliers, le roi Arthur parlait avec un petit garçon qui l'écoutait attentivement. Merlin si tu le souhaites, je vous propose que nous rentrions au château pour vous restaurer et vous reposer. Ensuite nous pourrions continuer cette discussion. Merlin hésita mais acquiesça. Comme un automate, il marchait vers le château. Mais Lucas ne l'entendait pas de cette oreille. Il voulait comprendre et qu'on lui explique. Alors comme un même personne Arthur et Merlin se retournèrent pour voir le fils debout comme un piquet, ne voulant pas bouger. Merlin fit demi-tour s'avançant vers son fils Lucas mon ange que se passe t'il ? Je n'irais nulle part. cette phrase arrêta la marche des chevaliers qui commençaient a s'avancer vers le château. De même que merlin Arthur 'avança vers son fils. Pourquoi tu n'es pas resté avec lui quand j'étais ton ventre ? j'aurais eu mes deux papas depuis longtemps. Lucas avait les larmes aux yeux, il ne comprenait pas comment il pouvait avoir le roi Arthur pour père et ne pas le savoir. Si le roi Arthur n'aimait pas son père, cela voulait dire qu'il ne pouvait pas l'aimer non plus. Ces réflexions accentuèrent les larmes du garçon. Parce qu'avant c'est moi qui ne voulait pas de lui répliqua Arthur en coupant merlin qui voulait prendre la parole. D'accord. Papa je veux rentrer. Il avait les yeux baissés. Il a avait raison si le roi n'aimait pas son père alors forcement c'est qu'il ne l'aimait pas non plus. après que son père lui raconté l'histoire il voulait tellement rencontrer son autre père mais lui ne les aime pas. Il voulait rentrer. Lucas chéri raconte moi parla inquiet Merlin de voir son fils dans cet état peut être que celui-ci lui en voulait. Si tu es parti c'est qu'il ne t'aimait pas alors je pense qu'il ne peut pas m'aimer non plus alors je veux rentrer. Arthur paniqua comment son fils pouvait penser cela, oui il avait fait une erreur mais il ne va pas la payer toute sa vie. De son visage choqué, il vit merlin le regarder avec des yeux d'inquiétude. Ces yeux qui lui demandaient de dire quelque chose a son fils et vite. Non c'est faux. Vous êtes ce que j'ai toujours voulu au monde. Arthur souffla et pris son courage a deux mains. Merlin et Lucas le regardait et écoutait. J'ai fait la plus grosse erreur de ma vie en te rejetant ce matin la , je le sais et je le regrette. Mais quand j'ai appris que tu existais et surtout que tu étais mon fils ca été la plus belle journée de ma vie. Je sais que j'ai beaucoup de choses a me faire rattraper, mais pour l'instant je voudrais juste qu'on apprenne a se connaitre tous les trois si vous êtes d'accord. Arthur espérait avoir convaincu son fils et les regardait anxieux en attendant leur réponse. Le fils et le père se lancèrent un regard. Je commence a avoir faim. Etant donné qu'on rentre plus, on peut aller manger ? demanda le garçon ce qui fit sourire les deux adultes. Le repas se passa bien entre discussions et Lucas qui posait des tas de questions Arthur tout en se goinfrant. Merlin observait toute cette assemblée qui était comme sa famille autrefois. Les uns comme les autres il les regardait rire, discuter, se chamailler Mais maintenant il ne se sentait plus a sa place au milieu d'eux. Il se leva et disparut dans un des couloirs sous les yeux du roi qui fit de même pour le suivre en laissant des instructions pour veiller sur son fils. Merlin avait trouvé refuge dans le seul endroit ou il pouvait prétendre encore se sentir bien a camelot, chez Gaius dans sa chambre. Je savais que je te trouverais ici. Arthur n'avait pas besoin de chercher, il avait senti le malaise du sorcier et savait ou le trouver. Vous vous mettez a jouer a cache cache Arthur ? merlin parlait d'une voix douce et tremblante. Comme il pouvait savoir ou le trouver. Ca ne vous ressemble pas. Arthur rejoignit merlin qui était assis sur son ancien lit et se mit près de lui. Pardonne-moi. L'humiliation et le mal que je t'ai fait. Tu as fait du bon travail avec notre fils. Il avait dit cela en rigolant. Il avait beau savoir que ce garçon était son fils, il n'arrivait toujours pas a y croire. Pendant ma grossesse, j'ai prié tous les dieux de la terre pour ne pas qu'il vous ressemble et ils ne m'ont pas écouté. Il est votre portrait caché. Pourquoi as-tu souhaité cela ? Parce que je vous voulais vous oublier et ce n'était pas la meilleur des façons de voir mon fils avec votre visage. As-tu réussi ? a m'oublier je veux dire… sa vois était tremblante Non jamais même si je l'ai souhaité de toutes mes forces. A peine la phrase fini Arthur se mit a genoux devant lui avec des yeux brillant. Si merlin l'aime toujours il allait tenter le tout pour tout même s'il faut essuyer un échec. Je ne m'excuserai jamais assez. Je sais que j'i beaucoup a me faire pardonner et rattraper auprès de toi et de notre fils. Mais accepterais-tu de nous laisser une chance d'être ensemble tous les trois comme une famille. Merlin n'hésita pas et lui sauta au cou en pleurant a la grande joie de celui-ci. J'ai tellement espéré et rêvé entendre ces mots de ta bouche. Je te demande pardon. Pardon pour tout. Je ferais tout ce qu'il est a mon pouvoir pour effacer ce mal être que j'ai crée. On va être une famille tous les trois. Cela risque de ternir ta réputation et je ne le veux pas. Je ne ferai pas la même erreur deux fois. Jamais plus je ne t'écarterai de ma vie. Ni toi ni notre fils. Tu as ma parole. Gêné merlin ne sut comment se comporter et se leva, trouvant une excuse il voulait partir. Il faut qu'on aille retrouver Lucas, il risque de s'inquiéter et… Il va bien ne t'en fais pas. J'ai demandé a Lancelot de prendre soin de lui. Reste avec moi. Ici ? ce n'est pas digne d'un roi. C'est digne de nous. Je sais que tu te sens a ton aise ici donc je n'ai pas d'autre choix que d'y rester tant que c'est avec toi. Merlin se rassit sur le lit et s'y allongea. Arthur fit de même. Il voulait tellement Merlin dans ses bras mais il n'osa le faire. Voyant l'hésitation de celui-ci le sorcier prit l'initiative de mettre la tête sur son torse. L'autorisation était donné ce que le roi fit. C'est ainsi qu'ils passèrent la nuit, dans les bras de l'un et de l'autre en espérant rattraper le temps perdu. C'est au petit matin, fier comme un paon que Gaius décida de se diriger vers ses appartements et comme a son habitude depuis cinq ans, il jeta un coup d'œil dans la chambre de son protégé. Ce qu'il vit le réveilla et le dessoûla pour de bon. Évitant de faire du bruit pour ne pas réveiller des tourtereaux, il fit demi-tour et se dirigea vers les appartements de Lancelot. Devant la porte, il entendit des rires et s'empressa de toquer pour qu'on lui ouvre. Ah Gaius. Bonjour. Bonjour Guenièvre. Puis j'entrer ? celle-ci était depuis trois ans marié au chevalier Lancelot. Elle s'était aperçu que pour Arthur il y avait que le sorcier. Donc elle se tourna vers Lancelot qui lui aimait toujours. Oui bien entendu. Excusez-moi mon impolitesse. Il y a pas de mal ma chère répondit il avec le sourire qu'elle lui rendit. Il entra et trouva Lucas qui essayait tant bien que mal de finir son petit déjeuner enfin petit n'était pas le mot. Guenièvre essayait de faire plaisir au garçon dont elle mit tout sur la table. C'est la confiture plein le visage qu'il dit bonjour au médecin qui éclata de rire, en voyant Arthur étant petit. Quand tu auras terminé, je t'emmène a tes parents. Cette phrase eut bon de mettre fin au petit déjeuner pour Lucas qui se mis sur ces pieds pour y aller mais fut stopper par Guenièvre qui débarbouilla et le laissa partir avec le médecin. Lucas entra dans la chambre ou étaient couché ses parents. Il ne savait pas s'il devait les réveiller, mais sa tirade fut coupé par Arthur qui le prit brusquement dans ses bras ce qui fit rire Lucas. Père. E n'ai pas vu que tu étais réveillé. Père ? demanda le roi déconcerté. Oui, je ne vais pas t'appeler aussi Papa ca serait bizarre c'est ce que oncle lancelot a dit. Oncle lancelot ? Oui avec tante Guenièvre. D'accord son fils s'était fait apparemment un oncle et une tante. Ca va prendre du temps mais il s'y fera. Il n'avait nullement envie de le contrarié pas maintenant qu'ils viennent de se retrouver. D'accord mon fils. Dit père, si je suis vraiment ton fils et que tu es le roi, ca veut dire… Oui cela fait de toi un prince, puis un jour tu deviendras roi. Et papa ? Arthur tourna la tête vers merlin qui dormait toujours. S'il le souhaite je ferais de lui aussi un roi. Papa un roi mais il ne peut pas y avoir deux rois. Et comment tu vas faire cela ? C'est tout simple. Je lui demanderai de m'épouser. Arthur sentit merlin se tendre. Il sourit. Son sorcier ne dormait pas mais fi semblant de n'avoir rien senti et continuer. Tu veux te marier avec papa ? Oui tu serais d'accord mon grand ? Oui. Es que je pourrais inviter le dragon ? Cette question réveilla merlin qui s'y opposa. Il en ait hors de question. Pourquoi ? Parce que. Déjà qu'il t'apprend a te servir de ta magie c'est non. Mais il dit que si je la contrôle bien, je serais encore plus puissant que toi dans pas longtemps. Il va falloir que je parle a ce fourbe de dragon. Kilgharrah n'est pas fourbe. Père ca veut dire quoi fourbe ? Arthur les regardait se disputer et éclata de rire en surprenant les deux autres. Il se sentait a sa place auprès d'eux. Il se rapprocha de merlin et lui murmura a l'oreille « épouse-moi » ce qui fit rougir le sorcier. Papa tu es malade tu es tout rouge. Mais ne fit pas attention a son fils. Oui avait il répondu en le regardant droit dans les yeux, emmenant un baiser fougueux mais doux. Luca ne comprenait et ne voulait faire cela pour rien au monde. Arthur se dit qu'il leur fera oublier le passé. Parce que l'avenir leur réservait de beaux jours et il va s'en assurer. Il fera tout ce qu'il est a son pouvoir pour les rendre heureux tous les trois. oh bien sur, il devra présenter Lucas son fils au yeux de ses sujets et il savait aussi que CA ne sera pas amasse a faire. beaucoup ne seront d'accord qu'il est merlin a ses cotés mais il savait aussi que beaucoup le seront et il essaiera les convaincre. Il en fit le serment quant son fils le sauta au cou en souriant. Ils étaient sa famille, son bonheur, sa joie. Ils étaient tous ce qu'il a toujours voulus. Oui une famille tant voulue. Il avait a présent. Et peut être qu'après il essaiera de convaincre merlin de donner un petit frère et ou une petite sœur a Lucas. Oui l'avenir s'annonçait sous de meilleurs hospices. Et il y veillerai a ce que cela continue ainsi.[Chapter 9] Voila c'est la fin. Bonjour, tout le monde. J'espère que mon histoire vous a plu. La fin est je l'avoue très fleur bleu. J'ai une autre histoire en tête. Mais je ne sais pas si je dois continuer avec Merlin et essayer avec du Harry Potter pour changer. Donnez-moi vos avis. Merci de me suivre. C'est un plaisir de vous faire rêver. BISOUX. ","Summary":" Chapitre 1 assis sur son trône le regard plein d'ennui, scrutant la salle ou tout les chevaliers pa"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Looking through the screen 2: a new family, a new adventure!","Author":"Fanfic girl of all worlds","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12770631","Passage":"[Chapter 1] About 9 months have passed since I had my adventures in Oliver and company and I've been trying to convince my mother it really happened. \"I'm serious mom I really was in Oliver and company! I mean look at that poster!\" I pointed to the one with Dodger and Rita's children included. I was only guessing but I think it was accurate. \"That was not part of my poster collection before! How did it just appear?!\" I asked pointing to the picture. \"You probably just made it yourself based on what you wish Disney would do for a sequel to a flop of a movie.\" Rebecca's mother Martha remarks \"I think that the best thing that I could do is throw away this ridiculous Blu-ray!\" \"Then how do you explain the collar! Why would I bother making or buying a collar for myself?! I've had this looked at and let me tell you this is not cheap! It's almost a 50$ collar!\" I screamed now furious \"Because of your silly obsession with the story! Don't you even know that it was a foolish try to make an animal version of 'Oliver Twist'?! I am wouldn't be surprised if it hadn't inspired some children to be thieves!\" Martha said angrily. Rebecca thought about it for a moment. It was true that Fagin in the gang were pick pockets, but at the end of the story it seemed like they had reformed, I mean they did do it to survive! \"Your right. They did do some bad things. But they did good things too, and changed if I had to guess. Everyone deserves a 2nd chance don't you think?\" I asked. \"Once a thief always a thief I say if they really existed, which they don't. So I am just going to get rid of this Blu-ray!\" Martha said going over and ripping my system from the wall. But just as she took out the Blu-ray an electrical short happens, and Martha's world goes black. I had been trying to stop her mother also got shocked. The last thing I thought was 'here we go again maybe now she will believe me.' Author note Is Rebecca really going to have a new adventure with Oliver and the gang? And how is Rebecca's mother going to handle it? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out! All credit goes to Redwall on this! but I hope you stayed tuned for what is next to come.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 I slowly regained my senses, and my mother Martha was already panicking as she had already regained hers. I woke up and could tell by the way my body stretched that I was back to my cat form. It didn't worry me unduly though, it wasn't my first time in New York City after all! But I did notice that it was now winter time there, and that made me wonder how Dodger and the gang were fairing. Meanwhile, I took a look at my newly transformed into a cat mother. I was surprised to find that she had kept a lot of her human features in a way. As a human she had had blonde hair, and was slim in figure. As a cat she was still slim when ich would make her agile, her fur was light blonde with shades of darker blonde and black mixed in. She wore a black collar with a gold heart ID tag, but most surprising of all was that she was STILL WEARING her wedding ring. \"Where are we?! What is going on?! Is this some weird dream?!\" Martha screamed. We were in Central Park and as we passed a trash can I looked at myself. I was still wearing the collar Jenny had brought me but I had no idea where Martha's collar came from. Martha saw her reflection in the trash can and could not believe it! \"Is that ME?! Why am I a cat?!\" Martha screamed. \"We're in New York. But the New York City of Oliver and company.\" I replied calmly with a smirk. \"This HAS to be a dream! The movie didn't even take place in winter!\" Martha retorted and oh how I wish I had a camera! Her face was priceless! \"And the fanfiction community it is believed that EVERY Disney movie has a little bit of real magic in it. And that even when the MOVIE is over the story continues.\" I explained. \"What does that have to do with is happening to me NOW?!\" Martha demanded. \"Part of the belief also states that if you are too close to the device playing the movie and an accident occurs you will be sucked into the movie, or you have already been in the movie what happens afterwards.\" I finished, I could not believe I not only got thrown into the best Disney movie ever once, but some how I was thrown into it again! How cool is that?! \"Even if that is TRUE, which I doubt, it doesn't explain why we are in a new story when I never experienced the first!\" Martha shouted at me, not as bad as it could be I knew that for a fact because it could get so bad we each would scream in the others face for hours on end until one or the other stormed out of the room. \"Maybe because I had experienced the first story?\" I suggested with a shrug. \"Right now, we better find shelter.\" \"This would have never happened if you had never been so obsessed with that stupid MOVIE!\" Martha shouts at me. but I stood firm. Finally I decided to do something to something to cheer myself up. And maybe annoy Martha in the process. \"Come on Martha.\" Then I launched into a fimilar song a large smile on my face. \" One minute we could be in Central Park, Then be down on Delancey street From the Bowery to St. Mark's There's a syncopated beat Like I said right..I say whoo whoo I've gotten streetwise.. I can improvise I say..whoo whoo..whoo whoo I've gotten street smart..I got New York City heart Why should I worry? Why should I care? Say I may not have a dime Oh but I got Street Savoire Faire Why should I worry? why should I care? It's just a bebopulation And I got Street Savoire Faire hmm..hmm The rhythm of City once you get it down Then you can own this town You can wear the crown Why should I worry? Tell me why should I care? Say I not have a dime but I Street Savoire Faire Why should I worry? Tell me why I care? It's just a bebopulation And I got Street Savoire Faire Everything goes Everything fits They love me at the Chelsea They adore me at the Ritz Why should I worry? Tell me why should I care? And even when I cross that line I have Street Savior Faire! \" Martha groaned as we reached the end of Central Park. \"You even sounded like Billy Joel than, singing that ridiculous song. Just how are we supposed to get home.\" Martha asked with a deadpanned expiration. \"Go through the story of course! But since this is an unknown story I am not sure how long that will take.\" I shrugged sheepishly. \"Well that's just GREAT! Now what are we going to do? And what is that noise?\" Martha asked her anger simmering ever still. I hear it too, it sounded like two young dogs bothering a grumpy old man. A very, very familiar grumpy old man. \"I don't know. But I am going to find out. You can stay here if you want, but that will make getting home harder for you.\" I informed Martha trotting off towards the sound. Martha doesn't relish the idea of having to go through a ridiculous animal story, but seeing as there appeared to be no other way home she followed me to see what would happen. As Martha and I exit Central Park we see a hotdog vendor in a winter coat. Two young puppies about a month old were trying to score hotdogs off of him. The girl looks like Rita, and the boy looks like Dodger. The children didn't quite succeed in getting the hotdogs however. Little Rita had pulled Old Louie (because that's who it was) had pulled him down. The boy managed to pull the hotdog links from the cart, but Louie had started kicking viciously at the pups. It frightened them, and the two pups ran off leaving the hotdogs behind. Old Louie pushed his cart away, leaving the hotdogs that the pups had taken on the ground. \"I think I know where we can spend the night!\" I smiled as we walked over to the hotdogs. \"But first, I better get those hotdogs.\" \"That's STEALING!\" Martha exclaimed, if she knew why I was taking them and that they'd be our dinner she'd say otherwise. \"Their discarded. No one will eat them. And if those puppies are related to who I think their related to, their family is probably hungry.\" I remarked trotting in the direction of the barge. Martha resigned herself to the fact that I had a point. So, she followed me to an old barge. I said that it was safer than it looked. But Martha wondered what was going to happen to them when they entered the barge. Author note: So who are the puppies? Will the gang believe that Martha is Rebecca's mother? Will anything about have changed? Continue reading to find out, but feel free to review guesses! Ok I only adjusted a bit yet again Redwall did, like all the work! It makes me feel kinda lazy! also please look into the first looking through the screen to see what happened and why Rebeca was in the story before. and happy kinda late new year! and sorry for this being late... I hope you enjoy![Chapter 3] Chapter 3 I neglected to mention that snow was on the ground in New York City. It made the trip to the barge hard, and Martha was complaining the entire way. Once at the barge I was relieved that we would have shelter against the winter weather. And I have to admit that the hotdogs were heavier than they looked. I went down the stairs ahead of Martha and said in a chipper: \"Guys you're not going to believe this, but I'm back! And I have a Surprise!\" \"It's too quiet.\" Martha remarked \"Are they REALLY your friends?\" Before I could answer the two puppies jumped out of nowhere and knocked Martha and myself down! Little Rita says: \"How did you find this place cats?!\" I was thinking talk about de ja vu when Martha kicked little Dodger off of her. Fortunately it wasn't too hard so he was not hurt, but that action made me SO angry! I move softly and quickly so that Little Rita slides off of me and say to Martha: \"What did you do that for?! He's just a PUP!\" \"He jumped on ME! And this is all your fault anyway! I think that it is time I teach you a lesson!\" With that Martha jumps on me. Normally I would have gotten out of the way, but I didn't want to see the puppies get hurt. I was thankful that Martha hadn't figured out how to use her claws yet. It hurt what she was doing, but not so much as if she used her claws. But that didn't stop her from using her teeth which didn't feel good but it didn't feel as though she pierced the skin. yet... I was beginning to feel tired, not putting up much a fight to hurt her, after all, when everything was said and done, Martha was still my mother. I could also tell that the pups were feeling sorry for me, from the looks I got while trying to defend them and myself. All of the sudden a voice said: \"What's going on here?! What are two cats doing fighting in our home?!\" I recognized the voice as belonging to the Dodger. Little Rita says: \"Daddy! Daddy! These cats came into our home! The biggest one knocked Aj off her, and the younger kept her off of us!\" A female voice I recognized as Rita's says: \"The other cat wouldn't have had to protect you if you had stayed home! How many times have we told you to stay in the barge?!\" \"Too many.\" The puppies answer dejectedly. \"Come on in everyone, the pups are back!\" Dodger called up the steps The rest of the gang comes in. I am happy to see them Tito, Francis, and Einstein. Despite being tired from the fight I call out: \"Guys I'm back! And check out what the puppies scored!\" \"Rebecca! What is going on? Who is this cat fighting you?\" Rita asks looking worried. Martha had stopped after the gang came in. I either had saliva from her biting my shoulder or she had managed to pierce the skin, I was hoping for the former. \"Yeah. If she is going to be trouble we can turn her out!\" Dodger adds with a growl. \"No! No wait. She's my... mother , the puppies jumped us and knocked us down. She was just angry, please don't turn her out!\" I pleaded although I was feeling sore with her in more than one way. The gang looks unsure for a minute, but consent. \"Alright but if she stays she will have to behave.\" Rita answers. \"Pfft as if I'd be any trouble amongst a lot of flee-ridden-dirt bags?\" Martha laughed placing a paw to her chest, you know that little voice in your head well it was staring to tell me to return the favor she dished out to me, and then some. because that remark to some of the only friends I had was lower than low ! So? What will come of the pups actions? Is Rebeca seriously hurt? SO many questions my head is starting to hurt... Author note: Rebecca and Martha have had a fight, how will this affect their relationship? Will the gang trust Martha? What will happen next? Feel free to review guesses but, continue reading to find out![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Dodger didn't like Martha's attitude. And he said: \"Look, you're the mother of our friend Rebecca, so we will try to help you for her sake. But I will not tolerate bad behavior you hear?!\" Martha could tell the Dodger was not a creature to be messed with. And the fact that the gang of dogs outnumbered her, even without the pups. Tito was the first to notice the hotdogs around my neck. \"Hey Rebecca, is those hotdogs for everyone, huh huh huh huh?\" Tito was always excitable. It made me smile. I said: \"Of course. The puppies scored them off of Old Louie. That grumpy old man kicked at them so that they dropped 'em. The moment I saw them I knew that they had to be Dodger and Rita's. They look so much like you guys. Once Louie left I pick up the hotdogs and headed here.\" As I lowered my neck to let the hotdogs down I winced. This caught Rita's attention. She ran up to me and She asked: \"Rebecca what's wrong?\" The reason became apparent as soon as Rita got close enough to see me I had tried to hide it. And the fight I had with Martha, she had indeed PIERCED the skin! my shoulder was bleeding! Rita could hardly keep the anger out of her voice: \"Why did you do this? Whatever problem you have with your child, you shouldn't have BIT HER!\" \"I didn't think that I had really hurt her! Besides she needs to learn to mind me as her MOTHER! You have no right to judge me!\" Martha retorted Rita gently picked me up and carried me to Dodger's bed as it was soft, like REALLY SOFT. Rita ignored Martha and stating singing a song. \" Now it's always once upon a time, in New York City It's a big old, bad old tough old town it's true But beginnings are contagious there Their always setting stages there Their always turning pages there for you Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City? When you're with your friends and family it's like a once upon a time that never ends No one cares what happened yesterday As long as you live happily it's always once upon a time in New York City \" Sleep felt so close to me as Rita sang, as I was lulled to sleep by the melody until... Martha took a verse but didn't sing a nice one: \" If it's always once upon a time in New York City Why do creatures find themselves feeling so alone? How can anyone sleep starry eyed, when the winds Are hollering outside? And the wind is saying 'Now you're on your own?' \" That kind woke me up, all my life ever since I started believing in Disney magic she always though something was wrong with me, as if she was ashamed by me... Rita cut Martha off and sang: \" Rebecca don't be scared Though yesterday you weren't here Your friends are here to make you happy And a dreams no crime, dreaming is how the strong survive Once upon a time in New York City It's always once upon a time in New York City \" I'd fallen asleep. It was during the last verse Rita had sung. Even the puppies looked as if they were ready for a nap. Dodger placed Frita in his bed beside me. And Aj was put in his mother's sleeping place. It was still late day, so Fagin hadn't returned to the barge. Dodger spoke to Martha saying: \"Your Rebecca's mother so we'll take care of you. But if you continue to be mean you'll answer to me! Understand?!\" Martha said okay, but she didn't like the story that she and I were in. but I wasn't complaining at all. So Why is Martha so cruel to Rebeca? and what'll happen if she oversteps and has to answer to Dodger?! Will all be ok for the gang? Author note What will Fagin think of the new cat? How hurt is Rebecca? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 When I woke up I saw the girl pup laying beside. I didn't try to wake her up she was too cute. The thing that worried me most was that my arm felt stiff. How bad was my injury? I was angry with Martha for attacking the pups, and then fought her and PIERCED my SKIN! I decided that I would have to keep an eye on my mother . Meanwhile, Rita had noticed that I was awake so she also woke up Frita. \"You didn't have to wake up your daughter just because I'm awake. You could've let her sleep.\" I stated. \"That maybe true, but you both haven't had any food yet. The rest of the family including your mother have had their portion of the hotdogs, so now it's just Frita, Aj, and yourself that need feeding.\" Rita explained, she sounded kinda motherly. Now I wanna stay, a lot! Let my mother go back, I'll be fine here. \"Well, I am hungry. But my arm still hurts Rita. And it feels stiff.\" I informed Rita, slightly limping on my left paw. Frita was already heading to where the rest of the hotdogs were, and Rita was helping me on my paws. As I tried to make my way to the hotdogs I leaned heavily on Rita. Martha noticed how I was moving and asked: \"How are you feeling Rebecca? How is your arm?\" Oh, So now you care... Of course your worried...! I rolled my eyes and said with a little venom: \"I feel fine after my nap. Though I have to admit that my arm feels a little stiff.\" Before Martha can say anything Einstein says: \"Fagin is taking us to see Oliver tomorrow. Perhaps Jenny can take you to the vet.\" \"Aye, we wouldn't want a Juliet scenario on our paws.\" Added Francis. I gave him a look, Like I knew what that meant! That remark made everyone slightly angry at Francis, but said nothing. The puppies Frita and Aj saved the biggest of the remaining hotdogs for me who pretty much wolfed it down. Awwwww they are so sweet and Cute!~ As I was finishing Fagin appeared into the barge. But he was not alone. A cat about my size and age followed him, the cats colors were reddish orange with a tan underbelly, and golden eyes. Fagin called the dogs saying: \"I found a cat half starved. I know we don't have much, but I couldn't leave him alone. I found him buried in snow. I was thinking of calling him 'Charlie'. Now what have you been up to?\" I Gave a gentle Mew, and purred, though Martha just growled. Will you ever get over your stupid but lady?! They do it to stay alive! Wow! A new Cat? What'll happen? Will Rebeca be ok? I hope it's not serious. Author note Now Rebecca's arm is stiff how bad is it? How is this new cat going to affect the story? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 It took Fagin a moment to realize that Rebecca was with the gang. And another to realize that she was hurt. Fagin said: \"Rebecca what are you doing here? What happened to your shoulder? And who is your friend?\" Fagin looked at Martha and picked her up. He saw her and said she was beautiful. But he also noticed the wedding ring that was around her left paw. When he tried to look at it she hissed and snarled at him. Which resulted in both Dodger and Rita growling a warning which translated to 'watch your manners.' Meanwhile, Rebecca was getting acquainted with the new cat known as 'Charlie'. While Fagin could not understand the animal noises Rebecca and the others understood completely. Charlie was Rebecca's age and had been living with his mother on the streets. But as the winter has been particularly hard in New York she had passed away 3 weeks before. He lived on the streets on scraps and such but the snow the day before had been almost too much for him. And if Fagin hadn't found him he would died. \"Well, it is a good thing we're visiting Jenny tomorrow. Because I think you need to see a vet Rebecca. And Charlie should be checked out too, I wouldn't want ANYONE to be sick! Although I wonder where miss Martha got her collar? There is no address on it.\" After saying this he looks to the gang and says: \"I'm sorry guys my begging didn't amount to much today. But I brought a little food with it. And you know not too many people want to hire me.\" Martha had a look on her face that said 'why would ANYONE hire a thief?' But Rebecca and the rest of the gang shoot her warning glances. And so, everyone had another little dinner. As the hotdogs hadn't been much but two a piece. And Einstein was a big old Great Dane of a dog, if old and grey. But even that didn't appease him. So we eat a modest portion of the food Fagin brought. Before bed Einstein once again begged for the storybook. Fagin read a chapter. That night Dodger didn't sleep in his bed, instead Rebecca and Frita slept in it because of her injury. Rita sleep beside them on the floor by them as the bed was too small for her. Dodger spent the night in Rita's sleeping place with Charlie and Aj. Martha slept by herself in the middle of the floor hating everything that was happening to her. Wow Martha sure can be mean, and what'll happen to Charlie? I don't know but new chapters will be here soon! Author note how Fagin found Charlie in the previous chapter is how my father and I found my cat scounger. Will Martha ever come to respect the characters? What will happen with Rebecca? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out![Chapter 7] Chapter 7 As I awoke the next morning, I noticed that my arm still hurt, like a lot! I was so angry at Martha ! Why did she have to be negative about what was happening to us? But I looked at the puppy sleeping next to me. Frita was so adorable! Probably what Rita was like as a pup! Then I noticed Rita was awake as well. Rita was always the first one up. I chuckled mentally, she was vigilant, and most likely the best motherly figure, no woman ever! even as a dog! \"How are you feeling today Rebecca?\" Rita asked concern evident in her voice. Yep best PERSON EVER! \"Better. But I am scared to walk with this bad shoulder.\" I replied, going to lick my shoulder, then I stopped in my tracks... WHAT AM I DOING?! \"I will carry you to Jenny's on my back if I have to. I can't believe that Martha is your mother! What animal attacks their young?!\" Rita stated. \"Watch your tongue mutt! She is MY DAUGHTER and until she learns to respect me, I'll be as tough as I like with her!\" Martha yells at Rita. As if you care that I'm your daughter till your life is on the line! \"Miss Martha, I have told you once, and I will not keep repeating myself, you may be Rebecca's mother but I WILL NOT tolerate bad behavior, towards my family, or Rebecca! And if you don't listen I will turn you away!\" Dodger warned her. \"No Dodger please!\" I begged, miserable person or not, she was still my mother, weather or I like her or not, or weather she liked me or not. \"She's just confused. Please don't send her away!\" Mouth shut up! I dislike the words coming out of you now shut it! I reprimanded my mouth. \"You have a better kid than you deserve.\" Dodger informed Martha. \"Because personally Rebecca I think that you're better off without her!\" After that, the rest of the gang including Fagin wake up. Fagin says that since it is Saturday it will be easier to see Jenny. Rita was as good on her word and carried me on her back. Can I trade parents anyone? Because if so, I've got a prime candidate to swap mine! The puppies were also very polite to me. They had come to realize that I was a good cat (unlike my mother) and they still felt they had to make up for their earlier behavior towards her. They were also excited because today was the day they were finally going to meet ' Uncle Oliver .' When we finally reached Jenny's house it was Winston who answered the door. \"Oh, it's you again mister Fagin? What can I do for you?\" \"Is Jenny in?\" Fagin asked \"I have something to show her.\" \"Of course. Come in.\" Wow, interesting! I really don't like Martha! I kinda know what Rebecca is going through... if you consider the horse who you thought harmless, kicks you in the shoulder... Author note How will Jenny react to Rebecca's injury? What will she think of the pups? How will Martha react to her and Oliver? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out![Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Fagin was allowed into the home of Jenny. Winston couldn't help noticing that there were a few more animals than normal with Fagin. \"So the dogs you call 'Dodger' and 'Rita' have had puppies I see. If you wonder how I can tell, it's because they look so much like them. However, where did you get the other cats? I mean the ones that are not Rebecca.\" Winston inquired gesturing to Rebeca. \"Well, I found the boy cat in the snow. As for the female cat, I think she came to my place with Rebecca. And if I had to guess, I would say that this cat Martha, that is the name she has on her collar, maybe be Rebecca's mother. She's older, has similar fur color, and seems excited if anyone gets close to Rebecca.\" Fagin explained, and Martha hissed when her name was mentioned. \"I wonder how Rebecca got hurt.\" Winston remarked, if anyone paid attention, they'd have seen the eye roll Rebeca gave. \"Looks like some creature bit her.\" \"I don't know.\" Fagin said. \"But I have noticed that Dodger and Rita don't seem to like Martha. And I wonder where she got that ring on her paw from?\" \"It is curious.\" Winston said. \"Because it looks a wedding ring. Why would a cat be wearing a wedding ring?\" Before Fagin can say anything, Jenny comes down the stairs. She was happy to see Fagin and the rest of the gang. She was especially excited to see Rebecca again. But was immediately concerned when she saw the bites on Rebecca's shoulder. She looked to Fagin and asked: \"What happened to her? It looks like a bad bite.\" She then felt Rebecca's head, it was warm. \"It feels as though she has a fever! We need to get her to a vet right away!\" Jenny said worried. \"I think that we should take the older cat too.\" Fagin said. \"I don't know how long she has been on the streets, so a check up would be good for her. And this fellow I call 'Charlie' has definitely been on the streets. He needs a check up too. And we can't forget Dodger and Rita's puppies.\" In the heat of the moment Jenny had almost forgotten that today was the day Fagin had promised to introduce her, Oliver, and Georgette to the pups. They were the very image of Dodger and Rita. Oliver and Georgette were coming down the stairs at this moment. Rebecca noticed that Oliver had gotten taller and the last few months. But she was still bigger than him, barely though. They gave their greetings in animal speech so the humans didn't understand it. But Oliver was happy to see Aj and Frita at last. And was happy Rebecca had returned, but was confused by Martha's negative attitude. At that moment a young man around Jenny's age knocked on the door. When Winston answered it he announced that Jack Nichols was here. Jack was a friend of Jenny's from school. They shared a love of animals. And they spent a lot of time together. Jenny said she was sorry, but she had to help Fagin with his animals. Jack instead of becoming upset, offered to go with her. Because he liked the look of Charlie. But Martha once again was protesting in her animal sounds. It was a good thing that the humans could not understand her, because they would have thrown her out. let's just say a curse or two that Frita and Aj should have never heard were stated. And Dodger and Rita's hatred of Martha was growing. fast, she didn't help her situation in the least. Wow, a boy, a boy! If your wondering what he looks like he has hazel eyes, blonde-ish brown hair and fair skin. Author note: Now Jenny knows that Rebecca is back. Is Rebecca really sick? Will her mother EVER become good toward the characters and her daughter? Can you guess where some of the names of the new characters come from? Feel free to review guesses but continue reading to find out![Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Everyone Fagin, Jenny, Jack, Winston who was driving, and of course, the animals were in a limousine. It was a pleasant experience for Fagin and the gang who had not drove in such a fine before. Rebecca would have enjoyed the ride herself, but she was starting to feel ill. Her mother was really trying to comfort her because it was Rebecca's fault they were in this situation. If they EVER got home, she would DEFINITELY punish her SEVERELY! Rita on the other paw, saw Rebecca was not feeling well. She licked her face gently. Much like a mother animal would it's sick young one. ' I don't care if I never go home. ' Rebecca thought to herself ' Rita treats me better than my own mother. She can go home, I will stay here. ' Martha as if reading her daughter's thoughts began hissing and yowling angrily. If Jenny or any of the other humans could understand what she was saying they would have been shocked. And Dodger was trying to cover his pups ears at the older cats language. Oliver asked the older cat what was wrong. \"Just keep out of my way OLIVER!\" She spat the young cat's name out with such venom that Oliver went immediately quiet. Georgette was also with the group said: \"I have NEVER seen such a rude cat! I have come to enjoy Oliver's company and Rebecca is not that bad, but YOU Martha give cats a bad name! What do you think Alonso?\" Tito was surprised that she asked his opinion. Since he ran away from her the last time they were together. But secretly he still loved the champion poodle. So he agreed with her. \"Aye. Rebecca is a good kid. Why do you act so angry at her all the time? And you use such foul language that Dodger and Rita have to cover Aj and Frita's ears. You really should be setting a good example for your child, not a bad example.\" Tito said. Martha felt like saying ' Your not even REAL! You are just characters in a fictional movie that was a FLOP! Based on a really bad book! ' But instead she decided to hit on a more sensitive point. \"Like you and the rest are shining examples? You are thieves, pick pockets, and beggars!\" Martha exclaimed. \"You should be careful miss Martha!\" Dodger warned. \"If you keep talking like this, I will forget whose mother you are, and attack you!\" Rebecca who was still feeling ill said: \"Please Dodger don't! We have been going through some hard times, and she is just confused! Don't hurt her, she is my mother after all!\" true the last was with what venom she could muster. \"You don't deserve such a good child miss Martha! Dodger said \"If not for her pleading words I would indeed be teaching you some manners!\" Dodger said angrily. ' If I get the chance, I will teach YOU a lesson MUTT! ' Was Martha's thought and if Dodger could have read her thoughts he might have attacked Martha then and there. But as it was, he couldn't so that did not happen. Jenny was smiling. Jack was petting Charlie on the head, and Fagin was looking fondly at his animals. Finally they reached the vet's office and got out the limousine. For they wanted to make sure all the animals were okay. Especially since Rebecca seemed to be getting worse. Wow Martha is a molly but I think the name for female dogs fits her better since she ain't no queen with tht attitude! Author note How bad off is Rebecca? Will Martha end up offending Dodger and Rita once too often? Will Tito and Georgette get back together? And why is Jack so willing to help?

","Summary":" About 9 months have passed since I had my adventures in Oliver and company and I've been trying to "},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Oliver and Company: Like Father, Like Son","Author":"movie-crazie","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12887535","Passage":"[Chapter 1] What's better than love in the New York City? Now that Fagin no longer owes Sykes, and with the help of the Foxworths, he has gotten a job, apartment, and is about to marry a wonderful woman named Kelly that he has met in his job as a computer service business man. It's been three months since Fagin had saved Jenny and her parents happily thanked him by organizing the ceremony was a full house. Jenny was standing by Fagin, and her parents and butler were there in the audience with Oliver, Georgette, and the gang except for Dodger. However, the Rabbi was getting started to allow Fagin and Kelly to get married. \"Do you, Fagin, take and cherish Kelly to be your forever wife?\" the Rabbi started. \"I do.\" Fagin replied happily looking into Kelly's bright eyes. \"And do you, Kelly, take Fagin, to be your forever, loving husband?\" the Rabi asked the young woman. \"I do.\" Kelly smiled while looking at Fagin. The Rabi happily looked at both Fagin and Kelly. \"You may now kiss the bride.\" The Rabi announced. Jenny and the audience cheer with Oliver smiling and the gang barking after Fagin and Kelly kiss. Jenny then ran up to Mr. Fagin and hugged him...again. Fagin lifted Jenny. \"You are a beautiful and wonderful flower girl Jenny!\" Fagin said. \"Thank you Mr. Fagin!\" Behind the curtain where Fagin and Kelly were standing, Dodger was with a beautiful dog named Lucy, a Jack Russell Terrier just as himself. Just as Dodger looked into her eyes, he knew she was the greatest thing that's ever happened to him, even when they met as puppies. Lucy was also a street dog from Brooklyn, New York. Although she did not have a gang like Dodger, she was even more sly and slick than he was. In fact, some of Dodger's tricks came from her. She had come to New York City to see Dodger again and they fell in love instantly. Dodger and Lucy touched noses and a puppy was milking by Lucy's side. The other two were wiggling and waddling towards Dodger's paws. \"Oh Lucy, they're beautiful!\" Dodger whispered in a proud tone. \"Another girl. Two girls and one boy, Dodger. I'm the luckiest girl alive.\" Lucy replied. \"I know you know I feel the same way.\" Dodger said back with his head leaning against Lucy's. The wedding was now over and Fagin and Kelly, Jenny, her parents, Winston, and the gang (including Lucy and Oliver) were all outside walking towards the road. \"Achoo!\" Fagin turned towards Kelly. \"I'm so sorry, honey.\" Kelly said while blowing her nose with a tissue. \"Don't be. They'll be happier anyway.\" Fagin replied while giving his dogs his crooked smile. \"Guys, I know you'll be upset but you can't live with me anymore.\" The gang was confused. \"Kelly is allergic.\" Fagin said with disappointment. \"But you will have the best owner I have in mind if you're up for it...\" Fagin brightened up. The gang and Dodger and Lucy anxiously waited for an answer of their new home. \"The wonderful Foxworth's mansion!\" Fagin shouted. The gang happily barked and jumped on Jenny and her family. Oliver smiled brightly at his old friend Dodger and gave him a high-paw. Fagin gave the gang one last hug, but spoke in a soft yet serious tone. \"Dodger, I want you to be a good leader to the gang, a protector of Jenny, and a great father, to your own puppies.\" He reached behind his back and pulled out a basket of the helpless puppies Scottie, Dottie and Danny and handed the basket to Jenny. \"Take care of them Jenny...all of them.\" Fagin said with pride. Kelly and Fagin gave their last goodbyes as they rode in Fagin's new but old jeep with a sign on the back saying \"Just Married\". As they rode off, Tito started shaking in fear. \"So wait Dodger, man. That means we're going to be living with Oliver and...\" \"Hello, Alonzo...\" Georgette waved while batting her eyelashes. Tito gave one look and he fainted. \"Ay!\"[Chapter 2] About five months later, the gang was still living happily with the Foxworths. Dottie and Danny were about 8 months old (10 human years old) and Scottie was 5 months old (6 human years old) \"I'm off to school!\" Jenny shouted. Jenny's parents came to kiss her goodbye. \"Bye, sweetheart,\" Jenny's mom replied. \"See you later, Jennny.\" her husband chimed in. \"Bye Mommy! Bye Daddy! Goodbye guys!\" Jenny exclaimed. The gang barked (Oliver meowing) to Jenny goodbye. However, Tito on the other hand was barking for Jenny to come back. \"Hey wait up, Jenny! Take me with you! I need to get away from Miss Perfect, man!\" \"Oh come on, can't you ever forgive me? You haven't lost your love for me have you my dear Alonzo?\" Georgette begged while batting her eyelashes. \"Yes Tito, don't break the poor girl's heart!\" Rita chimed in sarcastically. \"Oh Tito, what ever shall you do?\" Francis smirked. \"You wouldn't wanna be ex-boyfriend number 187 now, would ya?\" Dodger laughed. \"Zip it, Spot!\" Georgette snapped back. \"I...\" Tito starts. \"Oh pleeeeaaasssseee!\" Georgette pleaded. \"I guess one more chance couldn't hurt.\" Tito finally gave in. \"Oh, thank you, Alonzo. I have a nice hot tub set up just for you.\" Georgette sang. \"You know me so well, baby!\" Tito replied. Tito and Georgette walked up the stairs to go to Georgette's room. \"Miss Six Time National Champion and Tito are back in session, boys.\" Dodger laughed. \"You still got it Dodge!\" Rita laughed. \"Hey? The Dodge never loses his swagger.\" Dodger responded proudly. Dodger climbed on top of the jacket hanger near the staircase, then leaped onto the railing and slid down while Dottie and Scottie, and mostly Danny, watched him in awe. Wow . Danny whispered in amazement. Jenny had finally come back from school and was in the kitchen across from the front door. Lucy walked up to Dodger \"Hey Dodger, could you spend some time with the pups tonight? Jenny wants me to play a game with her.\" \"Music to my ears.\" Dodger smiled. \"Thanks, Dodge. Oh, and they're teething so you might wanna play some tug.\" Lucy informed as she walked into the kitchen. \"Got it!\" Dodger called out. Scottie and Dottie suddenly entered the room where Dodger was. \"Hey girls!\" Dodger chuckled. \"Daddy!\" Scottie and Dottie shouted together with happiness. Scottie climbed onto Dodger's head and Dottie onto his back. He began to laugh while Scottie covered her father's eyes. Dottie ran and hid behind a plant near the front door. \"Wait a minute, where are my two beautiful pups? And who turned out the lights?\" Dodger playfully asked. \"That was me, Daddy!\" Scottie giggled in amusement. \"But where did Dottie go?\" Dodger sniffed the ground \"looking\" for Dottie as she chuckled quietly. Dodger then went over to the plant and Dottie quietly screamed and laughed. Dodger kept sniffing through the plant until his nose touched her cheek. It tickled Dottie and she giggled. \"I think I got her!\" Dodger claimed. Dodger moved the plant aside with his paw. Dottie playfully screamed. \"Gottcha!\" Dodger yelled. Scottie jumped off of her father's head and she and Dottie ran around the room screaming while Dodger chased them. Scottie jumped up and grabed Dodger's nose. Dodger gently put the pup on the ground and rubbed her belly with his nose. The pups then fell over and Dodger fells on the floor too and started laughing with the puppies. \"Hey, Daddy. Wanna see us race?\" Dottie asked. \"Alright. Let's see it.\" DOdger encouraged. \"Come on, Scott!\" Dottie shouted. \"We're going up the stairs and back. \"Okay!\" Scottie exclaimed. \"Alright. Ready? Go!\" Dodger announced. The stair were spiraled and there were about 20 of them. Dottie was in the lead as her sister followed behind. DOdger chuckled as the puppies struggled a bit. Scottie soon caught up and followed right next to Dottie. Scottie made it to the top first and they looked down from the railing. \"Hi!\" the pups said simultaneously down to their Dad. \"Now let's go back down. Go!\" Dottie started to go down, but Scottie looked at them and they looked bigger all of a sudden. The stairs seemed steeper too. It looked like each stair was 10 feet down. Scottie didn't know how to get down. What if I fall down? Scottie thought. Scottie whimpered. \"I can't come down.\" \"Whadda ya mean you can't come down?\" Dottie shouted from below. \"I mean I'm gonna fall.\" Scottie back away. \"Oh, come on Scott, it's not that bad.\" Dodger said. \"Yes it is. The stairs are a mile away from the next.\" Scottie whined. Dodger chuckled to himself amused. It's funny how stairs couldn't intidate him as a pup. He knew how to jump a gate by then. Huh. The perks of being a street dog. Dodger thought. \"Danny and I got down the stairs when we were little. Mommy and Daddy can't carry you all the time.\" Dottie rolled her eyes. \"Come on, Scott. If you get down... I'll let you stay up past bed time.\" Dodger said. Scottie sighed. \"Okay.\" She walk towards the edege and looked dow. She gulped and whimpered again. She closed her eyes and put her paw on the stair below. However, her legs were so short she couldn't reach so her body fell down with her. She was on the next step. \"Good. Now keep going.\" Dodger said. Scottie put her front leg out again to reach down, but this time a bit too far. A second later she rolled and flipped and twirled all the way down the next 19 steps and grunted as she bumped into the wall. Dottie gasped. \"You okay?\" \"Ow... Let's do that again\" Scottie laughed. Dottie joined in. They ran up about 8 steps and purposely jumped onto the next on so that the could slide down. The fell on the ground and started laughing as Dodger shook his head smiling. \"Hey, where's Danny? He's missing all the fun!\" Dottie exclaimed still laughing from their game. \"Let's find him.\" Dodger said. \"Danny?\" Dodger shouted. \"Where are you?!\" Scottie sang. \"Come out, come out wherever you are!\" Dottie sang along.[Chapter 3] Dodger traveled into the living room and suddenly grinned. Danny was singing his father's song \"Why Should I Worry\" and was on the couch dancing a bit to the rhythm. \"Danny, what are you doing?\" Dodger asked, finding it funny that Danny is really \"getting into\" the song. \"Oh, Dad! I um... Am uh...\" Danny started answering a bit embarrassed. Dodger raises one eyebrow and the puppy sighed. \"Daddy, you've got the best street... uh...\" Danny tried to figure out the word. \"Savior fair\" Dodger said. \"..in New York!\" Danny finished. \"Like you said, you're the coolest...coolest...\" Danny looked at his father. \"Quadruped.\" Dodger corrected again. \"Exactly!' Danny smiled but slowly turned it into a frown. \"I just wish I could be like you, Daddy\" Danny sadly admitted. There was a quick silence, but then Dodger jumped onto the couch next to Danny. \"Danny, you don't have to prove anything, you're coolest dog I know.\" Dodger said trying to cheer him up. \"But it's not the same!\" Danny replied. \"But it doesn't have to be. Come on, Champ. Those skills don't come as easy as you think.\" Dodger said concerned. \"So I can't get the skills then?\" Danny implied. \"Well...I'm saying that you don't have those kinds of skills that I had to learn.\" Dodger informed. \"That's not fair.\" Danny said angrily. \"Danny, those skills came from the streets. I couldn't have gotten them from being a house dog.\" Dodger explained. \"Why do I have to be a house dog then?\" Danny said upset. \"There's nothing wrong with that, Champ.\" \"But it's not as cool. I want to be a street dog, like you.\" Danny said. \"Champ, it's not that easy.\" Dodger discouraged. \"I'll practice.\" \"It's not like that, Danny.\" Dodger said getting a bit annoyed. \"Why not?\" \"I'm only saying this because you can get hurt by trying to be someone that you're not.\" Dodger said. \"And what's that supposed to mean?\" Danny sharply asked. \"You're not a street dog!\" Dodger finally yelled. \"So, you're saying that I could never be like you?\" Danny said looking like he was about to cry. All of a sudden Dottie shouted \"Of course you can't! You're so slow...and clumsy! You couldn't even get your food without being pushed 500 times!\" Dottie chimed in. \"By me may I add.\" Dottie chuckled. \"You know that's a lie. I'm faster than both of you.\" Danny smirked. \"Mommy and Daddy were New York legends. You don't have the strength to make you half as good as they were.\" Dottie added. \"It's like you don't even belong to this family!\" Scottie shouted. \"Quiet you two!\" Dodger said as he glared at the pups. \"No. They're right! I don't belong here!\" Danny said angrily. \"Danny, I don't know why you're acting this way.\" Dodger said annoyed. \"Now I know what you really think of me.\" Danny interrupted. Dodger tried to finish, \"Danny, just listen to-\" \"-I can't believe it, Daddy. You don't even believe me!\" Danny interrupted again. \"Of course I do. You're twisting my words around.\" Dodger said. \"No you don't. I can't have the skills if I'm not a street dog, right?\" Danny corrected. He jumped off the couch and ran to the doggie door and Dodger and the sisters followed. \"Come on Champ, don't do this, we just need to talk.\" Dodger begged. \"No! I'm going to prove everyone wrong. I can be a street dog. And I'm going to learn the skills by myself. You don't need a slow and clumsy dog in this family.\" Danny glared at Dottie and Scottie then, he ran out of the doggie door. \"Danny!\" Dodger called. \"Danny, wait!\" But Danny was already out of sight. Dodger shook his head and gave a sigh of regret. A few moments later, Lucy walked in. She saw Dottie and Scottie staring at Dodger who was looking down. \"What's the matter?\" Lucy asked out of curiosity. Dodger started \"Oh, um...Danny- he uh...\" \"-Daddy and Danny had a fight.\" Scottie interrupted in a tattle-tale tone. \"But...\" Dottie shot a glare at Scottie. \"It was our fault too.\" Dottie finished off. \"What was kind of your fault? What happened?\" Lucy asked anxiously. Dodger and the pups looked at each other, then at Lucy. \"Where is he?\" Lucy asked with worry. \"He ran outside. He's upset with me.\" Dodger admitted. \"Well, he needs to come back inside.\" Lucy said. Dodger opened his mouth but before he could answer, Jenny's mom called. \"Time for bed everyone! You too, Jenny!\" She called. \"Ok, Mom!\" Jenny replied. Jenny started counting to see if all of her pets were present. \"Okay, let's see. Tito, Georgette, Oliver, Einstein, Rita, Francis, Lucy, Dodger, Scottie, Dottie, and... hmm….where's Danny?\" She asked noticing he's missing. \"Danny! Here boy! Lucy, you and Dodger check outside!\" Jenny ordered. \"Danny!\" Jenny called again. Soon enough, the gang started looking for him too. Dodger and Lucy were outside and Lucy was sniffing the ground for Danny while Dodger looked around. \"Come on, we've got to find him.\" Lucy said wondering why Dodger was just standing there. Dodger walked towards the doghouse further down the yard. \"Champ, you in there?\" Dodger peeked into the doghouse. No Danny. Dodger saw something at the gate around the yard. He ran towards only to find a hole in the dirt. \"Oh boy…\" Lucy saw where Dodger was and ran up to him \"Well?\" Lucy asks hoping he knew where Danny was. \"I think… he ran away.\" Dodger responded pointed towards the hole. \"What?!\" Dodger tried to explain. \"I-I know...what I did was wrong, but I was trying to protect him and then he-\" Lucy interrupted him. \"Dodger...\" Dodger looked at her. \"Tell me everything.\" Lucy said while gently looking into his eyes. Dodger sighed, knowing she would be upset anyway.[Chapter 4] Dodger and Lucy are back inside but Lucy is walking back and forth anxiously. \"Why would you tell him something like that, you know how sensitive he is?\" Lucy yelled. \"Relax, Lucy,\" Dodger tries to comfort. \"Relax? How? I can't! He's not safe on his own. How are we supposed to find him?\" Dodger walked up to Lucy. \"I got Danny into this mess, so now I've got to get him out. I have to go and find him.\" Dodger told Lucy. \"Daddy, where are you going to go?\" Scottie said, fearful of her father not returning. Dodger soothed his daughter \"Don't worry little timer, I'll be just fine. And Lucy...\" Lucy looked up. \"I'll bring Danny back safe. I promise.\" Dodger told Lucy. \"Please, just be careful!\" Lucy warned. \"I will!\" Oliver walked up to Dodger. \"I'll go too.\" he claimed. \"Good idea, let's go, kid.\" Dodger agreed. Danny was walking along the empty streets in the city, wondering where he should go. \"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.\" Danny thought to himself. \"No. I have to prove him wrong. So, I can't go back.\" Suddenly a raindrop fell on his nose. Danny looked up and it started pouring. Danny sighed as he continued walking. Then, a sudden struck of lightning hit and Danny yelped. He fell into a puddle and started running. \"Where could he be?\" Oliver asked in an exhausted tone. \"Hopefully not in any trouble. Come on!\" Dodger urgently said. Dodger was just about to start running. However, it was not long before Oliver ran ahead and stopped him. \"Dodger, you've been running for miles and you're soaking wet!\" \"So?\" \"I think you need some rest. He couldn't have gone far? He's only a puppy you know.\" Oliver insisted. \"Alright. Just 'til morning.\" Dodger hesitantly agreed. \"Let's sleep there for tonight.\" Oliver suggested. They crawled under a bench nearby. \"Are you gonna be ok, Dodger?\" Oliver asked comfortingly, knowing Dodger was worried. \"For the first time kid, I really don't know. Danny could be in so much trouble. This is exactly what I was afraid of.\" Dodger said. \"New York's coolest quadruped, afraid? Did I hear that right?\" \"Very funny, kid.\" Dodger pushed him playfully. \"What exactly were you afraid of?\" Oliver asked. He looked straight ahead though, into a puddle in front of them. Dodger looked an him then looked away and sighed. \"You know ever since I moved in, I loved it there. I feel loved for the first time, ya know.\" \"Isn't that a good thing.\" \"Oh yeah. Now I know why you wanted to leave.\" Dodger smirked. Oliver laughed nervously. \"Sometimes I miss the street life a bit, More freedom, no baths. But it all goes away when I'm surrounded by my family. I just...\" Dodger sighed. \"I know the pups love my stories and all, but I'm afraid they'll want the street life. I guess it's on me because, I do make it sound pretty cool. But they don't understand what it's really like. They don't know that that is what what I've been trying to get away from for a long time.\" \"They don't get that they'll get hurt.\" Oliver agreed. \"Dodger, I get it. But I guess that come with age you know. They'll get it soon enough. I'd just remind them that this life is the most important to you.\" Oliver paused. \"It is isn't it? You don't want to go back do you?\" Oliver looked up. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" Dodger smiled. \"Don't worry, Dodge. I'll help you find him.\" Oliver says trying to bring hopes up. \"Thanks, kid.\" Dodger says in relief that his old friend was there to help him. Oliver smiled and snuggled next to Dodger just like old times. Dodger smiled and soon, they both drift off to sleep. Danny was tired from running, so he also crawled under a bench nearby. \"What was I thinking? I can't take on these streets like Dad could!\" He watched the lighting for a few moments and realized how scared and sad he really was but just gave a pity sigh. I really wish I was home. Danny thought. Danny lied down and drifted to sleep. In the middle of the night, Dodger woke up. He walked out from under the bench and looked and the night sky knowing that Danny was out there. Danny woke up too and looked at the sky knowing his family was out there. Danny looked at a puddle in front of him and saw his dad's reflection. Danny sighed. Both knowing they've made a mistake, they both fell back asleep. Not long after, it was morning. Dodger stood up. \"Oliver? Kid, wake up.\" Dodger whispered while nudging Oliver gently. \"Yeah?\" Oliver yawned. \"It's morning. But we can't find Danny now.\" Dodger stated. \"Why not?\" Oliver said puzzled. \"The Foxworths and everyone else are probably wondering where we went off to.\" Dodger admitted. \"But what if he wanders further away?\" Oliver mentioned. \"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Come on! We've got to get back to the mansion.\" Dodger replied. Dodger ran to get to the Foxworths with Oliver right behind him. \"Did you find him?\" Lucy anxiously. \"No, but I've got a plan.\" Dodger responded. \"Well? What is it Dodger man?!\" Tito asked excitedly jumping up and down. \"Okay, so we sneak out late at night and split up to find Danny, and once we have his scent, give a call and we'll find him together.\" Dodger answered. \"All right, Dodger man!\" Tito responded happily. \"Magnificent plan, Dodger.\" Francis added. \"Lucy?\" Dodger asked wondering if she was ok with the plan. \"Let's do it!\" Lucy determinedly agreed. \"Why don't we do it now?\" Einstein asked confused. \"They'll notice we're gone and will come looking for us, so they'd find us before we'd able to find Danny.\" Rita answered. \"Exactly, and who knows what they'll do if we leave when they see us. We'll be taking baths and grooming double time.\" Dodger added. \"So when they call us to bed, that's when we'll get a move on.\" Francis decided. \"Bingo.\" Dodger encouraged. \"Georgette, you wanna help us?\" Tito asked, knowing Georgette was not eager to agree to do things out of her \"comfort zone\". \"Of course Alonzo, that pup is always giving me compliments. Such a polite little thing. I've grown to like him very much.\" Georgette said with pride. \"But... I'm not going out of this house if that's what you're talking about.\" Georgette smiled. \"Can you watch the pups at least?\" Rita asked annoyed. \"Perfect.\" Georgette replied. \"Alright, we've got a full house! We break at twelve a.m.\" Dodger concluded.[Chapter 5] Danny started to wake up and gave a big yawn. He walked out from under the bench to find something to do. \"Well, I'm probably going to be here for the rest of my life. I can't go back home and I'm already lost anyway.\" Danny gave a short sigh. \"I might as well find something interesting to do.\" Danny's stomach growled. \"Or something interesting to eat\" Danny replied to his hunger. Danny walked along the street and saw a picture of a steak along with a sign that said \"If Your Pup Can't Be Beat, He Gets a Giant Bowl of Meat!\" Enter your pup in the Annual Doggy Run. How do humans understand these things? Danny thought. \"Well, I see a steak so I'm going in.\" Danny said as he walked into the place. There was a large stadium with lots of people shouting and cheering. He looked around and all of the young puppies were lined up near a track. \"This is awesome! I bet Dad did this when he was my age, too!\" Danny started to laugh but then got angry thinking about how he couldn't laugh when he had skills to learn. If his father couldn't teach him, he'd have to learn to do it himself. He shook his head to stop himself from daydreaming. Danny quickly ran in an empty space to join the race. The announcer was standing nearby with a megaphone. \"Alright everybody, we've got a full track! Pups! On your marks, get set... RUN!\" The announcer shouted shot a gun in the air. Danny was startled by the sound while all the puppies started running. Danny quickly started to follow the others. The other puppies were turning on the track while Danny continued running forward. Maybe he should just follow the others to learn the rules. He started off in last place but pushed himself towards the front. A few more meters and another turn. A few more meters again and another turn and he was in the front. The crowd started cheering. Ok! All I have to stay close! Danny thought to himself. He looked back and was next to a pup that was just about his age. The yellow lab was \"right on his tail\". Danny narrowed his eyes and ran faster. The race was almost finished he only had a few feet ahead of him. He heard the crowd cheering loudly. For the first time, Danny felt like a real winner. He finally felt like he was his dad. He knew he could win this race. He was finally almost there! But just as he was about to win the race, the dog that was right next to Danny just fled past him and won the race! Danny opened his mouth wide in shock. \"And the big bowl of meat goes too...DIXON! Lane 6, the cute little yellow Labrador retriever!\" the announcer shouted. \"That's my dog!\" a man shouted from the audience and ran up to the announcer. The crowd shouted with excitement, hats were in the air and banners everywhere. The young winner barked happily. \"Here you go, little guy.\" The announcer fed the pup a treat and handed a trophy and bowl of meat in the man's hand. Danny shook his head in disappointment. He was so mad at himself. He started to walk away and he left the stadium with all of his hopes crushed. Why did you enter a race Danny? Great job on embarrassing yourself in front of a bone's worth of people. Maybe I don't have what it takes. Danny disappointingly said to himself. \"Hey! He, wait up!\" Danny turned around. It was the lab that had just beat him in the race. The pup ran up to him. \"Uh... Hi. Dixon right?\" Danny said. \"Yeah. Um... Hi! Nice job in the race!\" Dixon said. \"Thanks. Why are you all the way over here though? Shouldn't you be eating or something?\" Danny asked a little angry. \"Well, I saw you looking a little down when you left the stadium so I wanted to see if you were okay?\" Dixon admitted. \"Oh.\" Danny replied a bit ashamed he was being rude. \"Why are you so down anyway?\" Dixon asked. Danny looked down before answering. \"I- Well it's just that...\" Dixon looked at him confused. \"Do you know, Dodger?\" Dixon gasped. \"Of course yeah! He was the best street dog ever! My dad and he were best friends! You know him?\" Dixon said excitedly. \"Well, he's my dad.\" Danny said sadly. \"Really, that is so cool! Wait...why are you so upset about it?\" Dixon asked Danny confused. \"I didn't do that race just for the food. I felt like if I won that I'd prove him wrong about what he thinks about me.\" Danny admitted. \"What do you mean?\" Dixon asked a little sorry for Danny. \"He said I'm not a street dog, I know I'm not but, he just doesn't think that I can be as good as he was.\" Danny sadly said. There was a pause. \"I'm really sorry.\" Dixon said trying to break the silence. \"Hey Dixon!\" A bold voice shouted out. The pups turned around and saw a big lab coming toward them. \"Dad!\" Dixon shouted and ran up to the lab. \"Son, I'm so proud of you! You did great.\" The lab smiled while hugging Dixon. \"Thanks, Dad!\" Dixon said a bit embarrassed. \"Well, who's your new friend, Dixon?\" the lab asked. \"Oh, Dad, this is...?\" \"Danny. I'm Danny.\" The lab tilted his head, \"Hey, weren't you the pup my son was tail to tail with my son?\" the lab asked. \"Yeah.\" Danny laughed embarrassed. \"Kid, you looked really good out there! You look very familiar.\" the lab said. \"That's because Dodger is his dad, Dad!\" Dixon said getting all excited again. \"Really! Wow! He and I were great friends when we were young. By the way, I'm Ricky. I haven't talked to the guy in a while! Is he here?\" Ricky asked hoping his old pal was around. \"Uh... He's...not here right now.\" Danny stumbled. \"Oh. I guess I'll just visit him sometime soon then, because we've got to get going. Where do you live?\" Ricky said a bit disappointed. \"1125 5th Avenue. That's what Jenny says all the time.\" Danny replied \"Great! We live on 1129 5th Avenue! I heard my people say that's only a few blocks away once or twice! We'll come visit you sometime. Again, great job in the race. Dixon, let's get going!\" Ricky said. \"Dad, can I just stay for a bit.\" Dixon pleaded. \"Alright, but hurry.\" Ricky said and started walking back to the stadium. \"Ok, where is your dad really?\" Dixon smiled. \"How'd you know?\" Danny asked surprised. \"You stumbled a million times.\" Dixon laughed. \"Okay. The truth is... I ran away.\" Danny admitted. \"What! Why?\" Dixon asked confused. \"Like I said, he doesn't believe in me! We had this fight and I was so upset I just... did the dumbest thing ever.\" Danny bowed his head in shame and looked away. \"Maybe you just need to talk to him or something. I'm sure he's looking for you.\" Dixon assured. \"No. He's going to be mad at me.\" Danny sighed. \"Dixon, we've gotta go, son!\" Ricky called from the stadium. \"well, I know you were amazing out there and I'm sure your dad would think so too. Trust me.\" Dixon said trying to make Danny feel better. \"Thanks. I'll see you around I guess.\" Danny said. \"See you around too, Danny. Bye!\" Dixon replied and soon disappeared into the stadium.[Chapter 6] Danny walked fro a while and the finally stumbled upon Old Louie's hotdog truck. Danny walked over to the truck, catching the scent of the freshbeef hotdogs. \"Mmm...\" Danny said excitedly as he licked his lips. But unfortunately, Louie spotted the puppy. He put his hand over his head and gave an annoyed sigh. \"How many dumb mutts are gonna steal from my truck.\" Louie muttered to himself. \"Get outta here, pup. Can't you read? No 4 legged Animals!\" Louie warned. Danny, still fixed on the smell, didn't notice Louie coming towards him. \"Go on! Shoo!\" Louie scolded. Danny took one quick look, but still had his intentions on looking for the food. He was too hungry to hear what he was saying. \"Alright that's it.\" Louie said in frustration. Louie walked over picked up Danny. The pup started to scramble, trying to get out of his tight grasp. \"Ya stupid dog.\" Louie shouted. He threw Danny on the road. \"And don't you come back, lya little mutt!\" Louie yelled after him. Thankfully, there was a red light and Danny ran to the sidewalk on the other side of the road. The puppy sighed both in fear and relief and started walking again. He wondered around slowly figuring out where he should go to next. Soon enough, a little girl holding hands with her mom noticed the puppy walking around. The girl pulled her mother with her and walked over to the puppy. She bent down. \"Hi there! What's your name, little guy?\" the girl asked. Danny thought she seemed nice, but was a little frightened, not knowing who she was. \"Well then let's take a look at your collar. Hmmm... Your name is Danny, isn't it?\" the girl read aloud. \"Honey, we've got to go.\" the mom urgently said. \"But mom, the poor thing is lonely with no home. We have to help him! Please\" the girl pleaded. The girl's mom sighed. The girl noticed some old boxes with blankets for sale at a street nearby. \"Can we at least make a home for him? There are blankets over there! Pleeeeaaaassssee!\" the girl begged. The girl's mom hesitated for a moment. \"Well, alright, but we'll have to do it quickly, sweetheart.\" the mom finally agreed. \"Okay, I will!\" the girl said happily. The girl picked up Danny suddenly and she and her mom walked down the street few houses away. The girl grabbed an empty box and 2 blankets. They went to a bench nearby and put the blankets inside the box. The girl placed the puppy inside. \"Here you go, Danny! Look Mommy, he's so happy!\" the girl convincingly said. Danny slept almost instantly out of exhaustion. \"You have a heart of gold, Lilly. But let's get going.\" the girl's mom said in a rush. \"I'll miss you. Someone will find you, Danny. I promise.\" Lilly assured Danny. The little girl and her mom soon disappeared from the busy New York City streets. Later at night, at the Foxworth's home, Jenny's mom came downstairs and sat next to Jenny on the couch. \"It's time for bed, honey.\" Mrs. Foxworth told Jenny. \"But what about Danny? He's been gone for two days and he's part of the family.\" Jenny complained. \"I know honey, but it's not like we can look from now.\" Jenny's mom apologetically informed her daughter. Jenny looked down upset. Jenny's mom looked at Jenny but then she cameup with an idea. \"I'll tell you what? If Danny doesn't come back by tomorrow, Daddy and I will make some signs and post them around the neighborhood. Does that sound okay?\" Mrs. Foxworth suggested. \"Yes, thank you Mommy.\" \"Of course. You've got to get ready for bed sweetheart, okay?\" Mrs. Foxworth said. \"Okay.\" Jenny replied still upset. Jenny's mom soon left the room. \"We can't leave Danny out there! But what can we do?\" Jenny sadly said as she pet Dodger. All of the dogs looked at each other with sad expressions. Dottie tried to comfort Scottie who was hugging her and sniffling and Dodger looked away regretting what he had caused. \"You guys heard Mom. I've got go to bed. But we'll think of something. I promise.\" Jenny comfortingly told her pets. Jenny left the room to head upstairs for bed. \"Alright, you know we can't let them put up those signs, tomorrow. Someone could take him away from us or worse.\" Lucy fearfully informed. \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Einstein asked. \"Let's do this!\" Rita said eagerly. \"I'll watch the pups.\" Georgette offered. \"Everyone sneak out quietly.\" Dodger warned. Everyone ran out of the doggie door as Dodger was counting the dogs and Oliver. He was about to go through, but Scottie was racing to go out too. Dodger quickly picked her up in his mouth and put her down next to Dottie. \"Where do you two think you're going?\" Dodger angrily whispered loudly to make it seem as if he were yelling. \"We're coming to help find Danny too!\" Scottie said enthusiastically. \"No! This is way too dangerous! You guys need to stay here!\" Dodger informed frustrated. \"We caused this too, so we have to help.\" Dottie pleaded. \"There's no way of talking you pups out of things.\" Dodger raised an eyebrow. The pups gave a big, innocent grin as a way to plead their father. Dodger sighs \"You two, have to stay. I can't let you get hurt.\" \"But what if you do instead?\" Dottie asked. \"We want to help.\" Scottie asked. \"Don't worry, Dott. I'll be fine. You both need to make sure Jenny is safe with Georgette. Can you do that for us?\" \"Yes.\" The pups said. \"Good. We'll be back. Stay here.\" The pups and Georgetter watched as Dodger left through the doggie door. It was time to find Danny. Danny was still sleeping in the box, but soon woke up with a big yawn. As a result of not eating for the past two days, his stomach growled like crazy. \"Oh, I'm so hungry!\" Danny complained to himself angrily. He lied back down with a pouty look on his face. Just a few moments later, the girl that had helped Danny out just a few hours ago was walking down the sidewalk with her mom again to catch a subway. \"Mom there's that puppy again!\" the girl exclaimed. Danny poked his head out of the box. \"Lilly, we can't stop now. Let's go.\" the girl's mom said frustrated. Lilly looked at her hotdog that was half eaten and threw it on the ground, just a few feet away from the box. \"There you go ,Danny!\" the girl quietly shouted hoping the puppy noticed the food was for him. \"Yes! Finally!\" Danny shouted with relief. Danny ran up to the hotdog. However, as soon as he was about to take a bite of it, three vicious alley dogs showed up. One of them was a big, muscular, Doberman. The other two were mutts, one of them being a tall, brown-coated, and the other was medium, bulgy, and had grey coat. The Doberman, who seemed to be the alley dogs' gang leader, slowly and viciously snarled, \"Get away from that hotdog, kid!\" \"But it's mine!\" Danny shot back. \"Not anymore.\" the brown-coated mutt mocked. The Doberman picked up the hotdog. \"Hey, give it back!\" Danny angrily shouted. The Doberman threw the hotdog to the medium mutt, and the dog ate it. \"Who are you mean dogs, anyway?\" Danny asked angrily. The Doberman answered. \"The name's Duke, kid. Tall one's Spike and bulky over there's Buck. What's it to ya?\" Duke said walking towards him. \"You can't touch me. You three don't own the place.\" Danny shot at them. \"We've got ourselves a tough one, boys.\" The Doberman, Duke, snarled as the three dogs started to circle around Danny. \"You guys don't scare me.\" Danny growled at them, remembering to be as brave as his father. \"Aw… how cute. He thinks he's so tough.\" The Spike smirked. \"I'm not cute!\" Danny retorted. \"I bet I'm faster than all of you.\" \"Oh yeah?\" The dogs started laughing. \"And what makes you think that?\" \"Because I'm a street dog that's why.\" Danny blurted out. The dogs started cracking up but Danny wasn't having it. \"I'm still not scared of you. You guys are just big fat losers. I can handle you.\" \"Why don't ya prove it, kid?\" Duke laughed. Danny growled and ran to Duke and bit his front leg as hard as he could. Good thing he was teething. Duke yelped and Danny backed off. The dogs stopped snickering. \"Oh you're gonna pay for that little soldier.\" Duke shook his paw in pain. \"I think we just found our desert. So let's see how brave you really are.\" Buck grinned. Danny held his ears back and widened his eyes in fright. \"Scared now, street dog?\" \"No!\" Danny stood up straight again, but he was backing up slowly. But then the Doberman smirked, \"Get him!\" Danny gasped and started running for his life with the three alley dogs right on his tail trying to snap at him.[Chapter 7] While Danny was busy running, Dodger and his family, Oliver and the gang were all walking around sniffing and searching for Danny. After a short while Lucy sighed. \"Let's face it! We may never find him before tomorrow, perhaps not at all!\" Francis cried. \"We just have to keep trying!\" Dodger encouraged. Everybody started to search for Danny again. \"Wait a second do you hear that? Everybody listen!\" Lucy said. Everyone listened closely. They heard vicious barking along with tiny barks and yelps. \"You don't suppose that's…\" Rita started. \"It must be Danny!\" Francis shouted. \"He's probably in trouble everyone!\" Einstein yelled. \"We must rescue your son, Dodger.\" Francis stated. \"Come on guys. Let's do this.\" Dodger gave in. Just as before, the dogs and Oliver ran to the rescue. The dogs were still chasing after Danny until he ran into a gate and was cornered. \"You'll never see the light of another day...kid!\" Duke snickered. Danny, scared to death, tried to back up, but there was nowhere to go. The vicious dogs were right about to tear him apart, but then Dodger jumped over the gate, and leaped in front of Danny while the others were right behind him. The alley dogs looked shocked with a bit of fright. \"Get away from my pup!\" Dodger snarled at the dogs. Duke looked surprised to see Dodger all of a sudden. He looked at Dodger and recognized him instantly. \"Well look-y here boys. Isn't this Dodger the greatest street dog in New York City?\" Spike laughed. \"Not any more. He went all softy and became a house pet!\" Buck corrected. \"Well, well, well. If it is isn't the Dodge of New York City. The protector that pathetic excuse for a human named Fagin, right?\" Duke mocked. Dodger stopped growling. \"Duke?\" \"Oh, so you do remember.\" Duke smiled. \"\"It' so nice to see you all grown up. Now you can protect yourself, can't you big guy?\" \"So where have you been all this time, Dodger? Livin' the good life while everyone else had to suffer because of you.\" \"Hey, whatever happened, you brought it on yourself.\" Rita said. \"I did nothing to you.\" Dodger growled. \"You kicked me out of my own home!\" Duke yelled. \"Hey, man, you did that to yourself, man! You almost killed Fagin, man.\" Tito shouted \"I was trying to get his attention.\" Duke rolled his eyes. \"Even if I jumped on him, he'd cry bloody murder.\" \"Oh yes, blood pouring out of his arm got his attention all right. He finally realized that you were a toxic junkyard dog who had no business being welcomed in our gang.\" Francis shouted. \"Yeah, toxic. Me. The one who was there the whole time. Then all of a sudden, have a little Jack waltz in and steal my place.\" Duke yelled. \"You were dangerous. You attacked Dodger and Fagin just for fun.\" Einstein said. \"To show 'em who's boss, ya old mutt! Now it's time for a review.\" Duke snarled. \"What do you want, Duke?\" Rita growled. \"What I want is for you to get out of my way so I can tear this kid apart, just like we used to do remember, Dodge?\" \"You touch him, we kill you.\" Lucy growled. Duke gasped. \"Lucy? What's this? You two are...\" Duke shook his head. \"I knew you two like each other, but this is your pup too? Ha! This is too good.\" Duke laughed. \"You chose a wimp like him, when ya could had this. Bad move, girl\" \"Take those dog with you and get out!\" Lucy snarled. \"Well then, if that the case, the kid will still be our dessert, and the house dog will be our dinner! Shall we boys!\" Duke snickered. The mutts were now about to tear Dodger apart but not before Danny leaped in front of him. \"Back away from my dad, freaks!\" Danny shouted. \"Danny, no!\" Dodger yelled. \"Keep your dirty paws away from us, losers!\" Danny ran and bit the Doberman's leg again. The dog screamed in pain, but Danny bit even harder. The dog shook him off but Danny jumped on the dogs back. Danny scratched his cheek and bit his neck as hard as his puppy teeth could. The Doberman yelped and smacked Danny off of him with his giant paw. The dog growled at Danny and mauled into his back. Danny fell to the floor and tried to get up but before he could, the Doberman grabbed Danny's left front paw. The Doberman swung Danny into the wall of a wooden shack as hard as he could while digging his teeth into the pup's leg. He then let Danny drop unto the ground in pain. \"Danny!\" Dodger and the rest shouted. Danny laid there, completely beat down and hurt. He couldn't move and he was knocked out cold. The three alley dogs were about to tear Danny apart for good. Dodger growled at the alley dogs in extreme rage and fury and ran in front of Danny, blocking him from the dogs. Lucy, the gang, and Oliver jumped over the gate and blocked Danny from the alley dogs with Dodger. The mutts looked at all of the dogs growling at them ready for a fight. \"The more the merrier.\" Spike grinned. The fight was harsh. The dogs bit and scratched with everything they had. The fight didn't last too long because the alley dogs didn't stand a chance against 6 dogs and a strong cat. It was long before the alley dogs ran away but the dogs and Oliver chased after them. The alley dogs were cornered on top of a cliff not too far away from the gate. \"Don't you ever come near us again or you'll be our dinner\" Dodger growled. The alley dogs backed up and they were trapped at the edge of the cliff. There was a quick silence but then the dogs barked loudly and the alley dogs fell off the cliff. From the bottom of the cliff, they ran into the woods. \"You guys better not mess with us again man! Or I'll shred you to bacon bits man!\" Tito shouted at them. \"Alright guys! We did it!\" Oliver exclaimed. \"Wait, where's Danny?\" Rita asked. \"Oh no! He's still down at the gate!\" Dodger remembered. \"Will he be ok?\" Einstein asked. \"There's only one way to find out. I'll go back and you guys get back to Jenny! Hurry!\" Dodger replied. \"I'm coming with you!\" Oliver said. Oliver ran with Dodger to find Danny.[Chapter 8] Dodger and Oliver were finally near the gate where the fight had started. Oliver soon spotted Danny. \"Dodger? Dodger, look!\" Oliver shouted. Dodger ran over to Oliver and gasped. Danny was still lying helplessly on the ground in pain. Oliver stepped back as Dodger walked up to the hurt pup. Dodger couldn't help but hang his head down. Oliver lowered his head in sorrow. Dodger looked at Danny for a moment in sadness. Dodger was thinking of how he had yelled and made Danny feel worse than he already did. How he doubted Danny's strength when he had put himself in danger, and hurt himself to try save Dodger. Dodger rubbed his nose against Danny's muzzle. Dodger knew Danny was going to be okay, but Danny did move. Come on, Champ. Don't give up now. He tried to wake Danny up again by nudging Danny's face then, Dodger gently licked his cheek. Finally, the silence was broken... \"Daddy?\" \"Danny!\" Dodger bent down to hug his son, relieved he was okay. Oliver also smiled with lots of relief. \"You okay, son?\" Dodger asked concerned. Dodger backed away to let Danny get up. \"I think so.\" Danny tried to sit up, but just let out a loud yelp and fell back down. \"Ow…\" Danny shut his eyes tight in pain. \"You okay?\" Oliver came over to see what was wrong. \"He bit me,\" Danny started tearing up. \"My back and my paw, but my paw hurts more.\" \"Alright Danny, don't worry. We'll get ya home in no time.\" Dodger assured. Oliver gently picked Danny up and set him on his feet. \"Thank you.\" Danny adjusted himself then looked around. \"Wait, the dogs are gone?\" Danny asked noticing no other dogs were around. \"Gone for good!\" Dodger said giving Oliver a high-paw. \"Dad, that was awesome! You did it!\" Danny said excitedly but then suddenly frowned. \"What's wrong, Son?\" Dodger asked noticing Danny's frown. \"It's just that... I… I got so mad but... I should've never run away from home and... I-I'm so sorry, Dad.\" Danny said in sorrow. \"No, I'm sorry, Champ. I should've never doubted you. You are more brave and courageous than I ever was. Never knew you had that attitude in ya, Champ.\" Danny smiled a bit embarrassed. \"And I owe you a million for saving my tail from being chow too. But I hate to break it to ya...you're definitely not a street dog\" Danny bowed his head upset. Dodger smiled. \"...you're a hero.\" Dodger said. Dodger bent down and hugged him. \"I'm so sorry.\" Danny whispered. Dodger sat up and face Danny and looked at him seriously. \"Son, I want you to understand this.\" Dodger started to say. Danny looked up. \"Sometimes I miss being a street dog. Some things about being a street dog can be fun and exciting. But others were painful and harsh. I don't want that life for you. I regret nothing leaving the streets. I have my closest friends…\" Dodger glanced over to Oliver. \"…And a wonderful family.\" Dodger smiled down at Danny. \"I could never give that up to be a street dog again. And I don't want you to do that either. Do you understand what I'm telling ya?\" \"I promise I won't. It's not as great as I thought it was anyway.\" Danny laughed. \"But…\" \"Yes?\" Dodger raised an eyebrow. \"Maybe you can teach me some of your tricks?\" Danny asked nervously. \"You know... just for fun?\" \"You know, that's a great idea, Danny. You can only learn from the best.\" Dodger laughed. \"Don't tell Mom.\" Danny chuckled. Danny leaned against Dodger's chest. \"Thanks, Dad. I love you.\" \"I love you too, Son, no matter what and don't you ever forget that. Now let's get going, your mother's worried sick about you.\" Dodger said. \"Thank you, Uncle Oliver. For finding me with Dad.\" Danny said. \"No problem, kiddo.\" Oliver winked at him and gave him a loving nudge. The three started walking towards home, but Danny let out another yelp and fell down. Man... stupid leg. Dany rolled his eyes. \"Looks like you got it pretty hard, didn't you, Champ?\" Dodger said. Danny nodded. He let out a tiny whimper. \"It hurts, Daddy.\" Danny whispered trying not to sound like a baby. Dodger chuckled and gave Danny a nudge. \"You'll be okay.\" Dodger picked Danny up by the scruff and soon enough, the three started walking back to the mansion. Back at the mansion, Lucy was, again, walking anxiously back and forth while Georgette, the gang, and the puppies sadly waited. But soon enough, Dodger came in through the doggie door, carrying Danny while Oliver followed. \"Mom!\" Danny shouted. Lucy ran up as Dodger set Danny down. \"Danny, what were you thinking? Don't ever run away again. You had me scared half to death.\" \"I promise I won't. I'm never leaving this house again. Well, unless for walks and stuff. \" Danny said sadly. Lucy sighed. \"Are you alright? You got knocked down pretty bad out there.\" Lucy said relieved and concerned. \"My back and paw are bothering me a lot.\" Danny replied. \"Danny!\" Scottie shouted and ran into the room. \"I missed you.\" Scottie said happily said while hugging Danny tight. \"I missed you, too!\" Danny laughed. \"Danny, you're okay!\" Dottie came running and jumped on top of Danny. They tumbled together laughing but Danny managed to get on top of his sister. Dottie was about to pounce, but Lucy stepped in. She quickly picked up Dottie and set her down near Scottie. \"Dottie, careful, Danny's hurt.\" Lucy said. Dottie walked up to Danny and he turned around. \"We're so sorry. We should've never said those things.\" Dottie started. \"We were so sad when you ran away.\" Scottie said upset. \"And I'm glad you're not... you know...dead!\" Dottie finished. Danny chuckled \"So am I.! It's okay. I was probably over reacting.\" \"Yep!\" Scottie interrupted but Dottie elbowed her. \"Ow!\" Scottie yelled a shot her sister a look. Danny rolled his eyes, but walked over to them and gave them a hug. \"Hey kid, you're back!\" Rita shouted. \"You were so brave!\" Einstein complimented. \"You saved Dodger from being doggy chow man!\" Tito laughed. Jenny came downstairs. \"What's all the excitement about?\" Jenny asked, but then gasped. \"Danny, you're back!\" Jenny happily said. Jenny knelt down and picked up Danny who happily panted and wagged his tail and kissed Jenny's cheek. \"We missed you so much!\" Jenny said while hugging him. The dogs barked and Lucy leaned her head against Dodger's to thank him. \"I better tell Mom and Dad!\" Jenny suggested as she set Danny down. \"Mom! Dad! Danny's back!\" Jenny said as she ran upstairs. \"You really missed me?\" Danny asked surprised. \"Why of course, why ever would we not?\" Francis replied. \"And you all give such wonderful compliments.\" Georgette proudly stated. \"Thank you Miss Aunt Georgette.\" The three pups said together. Georgette batted her eyelashes and sighed flattered. \"You know Dodger, you could learn a little from your pups.\" Georgette smiled. \"That's the first time you said my name. You finally like me!\" Dodger teased. \"Please Spot. I wouldn't go that far. Let's just say... I can tolerate you.\" Georgette winked. The dogs rolled their eyes and Oliver and the pups laughed. \"Hey Danny, I've got an idea!\" Dodger said. Dodger whispered into in to his ear what his plan was. \"Really, you'd do that!\" Danny asked. \"Why wouldn't I? Kids, repeat after me... Apsitively Posolutely!\" Dodger proudly said. \"Apsitively Posolutely!\" the pups repeated happily. Dodger grinned then shouted \"Guys, We've got a show to put on!\" Oliver, Jenny and her parents, and all of the dogs we gathered around Jenny's piano, but Dodger and Danny were on top of it. Dodger and Danny started playing a tune with their tails. Dodger started singing \"One minute, I'm in central park!\" \"Then I'm down on Delancey Street!\" Danny sang along. The duo sang and played to the familiar song. And not long after, everyone started to sing along to the chorus. \"Why should we worry, why should we care, we may not have a dime, but we've got street savior fair.\" The dogs barked and howled while Jenny and her parents clapped. The giant family all had an enjoyable time watching and singing along to the performance. Everyone was now upstairs for bed. Every dog was in their own bed while Jenny tucked the puppies into their basket. \"Goodnight, everyone.\" Jenny whispered while hopping into her bed. Soon, everybody had drifted off to sleep, but Danny got up and walked toward Dodger. \"Dad?\" Danny whispered. Dodger yawned. \"Yes, Danny?\" \"I just want to say...thank you, Dad...for everything.\" Danny said. \"Of course Danny, it's my responsibility.\" Dodger said. He paused for a moment. \"I never thought I'd hear myself say that in a bone's worth of years.\" Dodger laughed at himself. \"You'd better get some rest. You've had a long day, Champ.\" Dodger said. Dodger put his head down to get some sleep. Danny looked at Dodger for a moment but then jumped unto Dodger's bed, squeezed through his front leg and drifted to sleep. Dodger opened his eyes, seeing Danny lying next to him. Dodger smiled, glad that Danny was safe. He knew Danny was special in many ways and his kind heart was one of them. Dodger smiled happily and drifted back to sleep with his son.[Chapter 9] Thank you so much for reading my story! Sorry I deleted it, but it needed work. I first published it in 2015, so it wasn't that great. This was a short story because it was more like a movie in my mind than a story but I have been working on my other story, \"Oliver and Company: Mischief and Mayhem\" which will probably be a better one. I'll publish it in a few months. Please review, share, follow, or favorite. Thank you so much! Give me suggestions for \"Oliver and Company: Mischief and Mayhem\" if you've read it already. I will continue to edit this story. From ~MBFgirl ","Summary":" What's better than love in the New York City? Now that Fagin no longer owes Sykes, and with the hel"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Sharp Dilemma","Author":"TenderAngel96","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7397939","Passage":"[Chapter 1] House of wax Sharp Dilemma Chapter 1 – We are in trouble I do not own anything except my story line. I love house of wax and all its characters but I dote Bo… Hope you enjoy it and I am sorry for any possible mistakes...That's because English is not my first language... Anyway...have a good time with my story...it was a big decision to start writing so don't be strict! \"There was a woman in here\". Carly said to her brother while she was trying to be calm. \"She was alive and she pulled the curtain back\". \"The whole town is rigged. That's impossible\". Nick couldn't believe what was happening. \"You are saying that that's a real person…underneath?\" His head was going to break. What the hell was going on there. That woman was made with wax…but she was so real. \"Yes at the church they were all like that. At least 20 more\". Carly was making scary thoughts but she was trying to seem strong…Nick did the same. He had to get his sister and himself out of there but he didn't know how. \"Wade…\"Carly said with a weak voice ready to collapse. \"And Dalton.\" Nick said directly after her. \"I'm afraid it's too late…\".Nick was trying to hold the tears that were ready to roll from his eyes. \"Nick no!\". Carly started to cry whereas her brother was holding her in his arms trying to comfort her. \"Shhhh…It's ok honey…We'll be ok! \"Oh no! Blake and Paige…They are still at the campsite. We have to tell them about all this! They are in great danger.\"Carly was afraid because she knew that that freaks were going to harm their friends. \"Ok…just calm down. Give me your cellphone to warn them.\" \"Ok…oh no…shit! I left it in Bo's track.\" \"You mean in that freak's track!\". Nick said showing hard hatred against Bo. \"Yeah, all right\". Carly didn't care at all. All she wanted was to leave that horrific place and that freak, like Nick called him…and his brother if there was one. \"Let's go find that phone. Stay close\". They headed to the track carefully in order to find Carly's cellphone and ready to cope with any threat. Back to the campsite \"Blake! Goddamn it, I need to talk you for a minute! Blake!\" Paige was so angry because Blake refused to listen her. She had to tell him… It was hard but she had to…She had to talk to him about his baby…their baby that was coming too early to their lives. The baby that would become the reason to bury their lives…and especially her life. Blake wouldn't want to marry her… and so did she. It was too early to have a baby, too early to get married, too early to change her life… It was a special moment and Blake was busy with the damn music… ''I 'm coming!\" She heard Blake from inside the tent but she didn't answer. Maybe this was not the right time to tell him…She turned the light off and she closed her eyes to sleep. Blake finally came in after he had turned the radio off. \"Baby, what's going on?\". There is something I have to know, right? \"Yes, there is something you have to know…but I don't know if it'll be pleasant to you…\". She said trying to take courage. \"What?\" Their argument stopped right there after they heard something coming from outside. \"What was that?\" Paige asked and Blake came out to see… \"Stay here\" he said. \"No , I am coming with you…\". \"Paige just stay here!\" \"No!\". She finally said and got out with him. But she started screaming after she saw Vince holding a huge knife. The truth was that if Bo knew that Vincent came there he would be mad. \"Blake!\" \"Paige! Come with me…run!\" They started running into the forest while Vincent was following them. \"What are we doing? Where are we going?\" She said full of fear. \"I don't know…just run!\" They finally reached a place full of old cars. A place so remote.\" Let's hide somewhere. Hurry up!\". Blake said and dragged Paige to his side. Vincent entered the abandoned sugar mill, or whatever was that, searching for his new future wax figures. Suddenly he heard a noise and he turned to see what was happening. Immediately Blake shot him in the arm with an old gun which happened to work. Vince felt down covered in blood and with his mother's knife in his hands…Blake and Paige got out of there and decided to go to the town to which the others went to find that fan belt. \"Blake I am scared!\"Paige said but Blake seemed not to here her. \"Blake I am talking to you!\" \"What now? It's not my fault that that freak attacked to us!\" \"But where are we going now?\" \"To find Nick, Carly, Dalton and Wade.\" \"God, I hope they are ok!\" She finally said. They reached the town but their friends didn't seem to be there. That was not the best thing that could have happened to them that moment… PLEASE COMMENT.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 – The plan I 'm back with the second chapter of \"Sharp Dilemma\" and I hope you enjoyed the first one… its plot is a bit different than usually but it's fiction, right? But let's not mouth anymore…READ AND REVIEW PLEASE! YOUR OPINION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME! \"Come on Paige, here we are\", Blake said looking for the other guys but they didn't seem to be there. \"Yes but…but where are the others?\" Paige said mainly looking for Carly but she was so afraid and disappointed. \"This place is so weird\", Blake whispered. The sight of that town was breathtaking…but there was something else in the air…in its view. \"Let's find someone to help us. There must be someone here\". He said feeling very upset but he didn't want to scare his girlfriend. IN THE THEATRE \"Is he dead?\" Carly said to her brother after he had hurt him with two arrows. \"I don't know, just check him\", Nick said to Carly and she did as he asked. \"Nothing in his pockets, Nick let's get out of here!\" Nick may had hit Bo but she was afraid… Bo was dangerous…and a strong man…he would probably be ok in a few minutes. \"Carly, let's go…there are no hopes for Wade and Dalton\", he held himself from not crying hard. His best friend…even his sister's boyfriend with whom he never had a good relationship… \"Nick!\", Carly was unconsoled. \"I want them to be ok! We can't live them like tha…\" \"We must leave you understand? It's unavailing!\" \"Then let's just leave!\", she gave him a cold sight and she started walking outside the theater. Nick followed her. IN SINCLAIRS' HOUSE Brothers' house was cold and lifeless. It was big and wide but it didn't lodge happiness. Bo didn't have a girlfriend, he couldn't love because he was sore by his parents' attidute and Vincent would give anything to be normal and have someone who would be with forever… After Vincent waken he went to his house. He sat to the couch and he tried to stop the bleeding…At the same time Bo entered the room with his hand and chest bleeding. \"Hey…you don't ever leave here without me. You know better than that. Don't be so stupid\" Bo was angry and he knew that Vincent was attached to him. Vincent loved his but he didn't care about him a lot. \"What's the matter with you? What the hell did you think you were doing?\" Bo had forbidden Vincent to go outside the town due to his face. But Vince thought that it would help them kill that people faster. \"Fucking freak! You destroyed everything!\" Vince was only looking at him. He couldn't say a thing because he knew Bo was right. He shouldn't go outside the town, outside his museum…His only world. IN THE TOWN \"Nick, I hear something…\", Carly said and immediately showed Paige and Blake to her brother. \"Thank you God!\", Nick said relieved after he had seen his friends being well. \"Carly!\", Paige said and run to hug Carly. \"Thank God we found you!\" \"What the hell is going on here? Where are the others?\" \"It's a horrible story, there are two freaks who want to kill us and make us wax figures and place us to that fucking museum\", Nick said both angry and heavy-hearted. \"What? Is one of them with long hair and an almost blasted face?, Blake asked. \"We don't know, we 've only seen one of them, that's Bo. He is normal. Well…not that normal…but his face is ok\" \"He must be his brother , Vincent\", Nick said. \"You mean that there are two of them?\", It was hard for Carly to believe that they had to cope with two maniacs instead of one. \"What are we doing, now? What about Wade and Dalton?\" Paige asked worried about her friends. \"They are probably dead. It's a miracle that we are alive. And you, too\" \"You mean there is no hope to find them? Blake asked. \"I don't think so\", Carly said regretted. \"Ok, let's not talk anymore. We have to get the hell out of here\" \"Yes, but where are the freaks?\", Paige had no idea about them. \"Bo must have returned to his house but I don't know about Vincent… \"We hurt him\", Blake told them. \"So he must be to his house right now, too\" \"But how can we know?\", Carly asked Nick. \"Let's approach their house…\", Nick said determined. \"What? No!\", Paige said but she was disapproved by Carly. \"Yes, Nick is right. We have to\" \"Let's go then\", Blake and Paige followed them not being sure about the sequel. They started approaching the Sinclairs' house when Carly stopped. \"What? Did you changed your mind?\", Nick asked her. \"No, I just have an idea. Nick give me your lighter\" \"Why?\" \"Just give it to me…I'm going to burn the HOUSE OF WAX… \"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 – We are ok I feel disappointed because nobody reviewed my story and that's why I didn't kept writing. But I decided to write again. Well…This is the 3rd chapter of my story…Enjoy ~_^ \"Burn down the museum? Are you sure?\" Paige asked not being sure about that idea? \"Yes, we'll do it. It's the only way to leave that place\" Carly answered. \"Let's go see if they are in the house\", Nick said. \"They must be, I heard Bo shouting…probably at Vincent\" Carly assured them. \"This make things easier. Come on. Let's go!\" Nick shouted a bit. \"So, let's do it\", Carly finally said. They headed to the wax museum. Carly attempted to turn the lighter on but Nick grabbed it. \"Give it to me\", I 'll do it\" Nick approached the museum and lighted the front wall next to the entrance. Slowly and then faster the museum stared to melt while Bo and Vincent were inside their home. Nick, Carly, Paige and Blake left the town with caution in order not to be visible to the two brothers. After a while, after Bo had managed to remove one of the arrows which was inside his arm he saw Vince still sitting on the couch. \"Get this shot out of your shoulder, what are you waiting for? Vince didn't answered but he suddenly lifted of the couch and went to the window to see what was going on outside… \"Bo\", he said hardly in a scratched, gentle voice. Bo moved near the window and he was surprised and angry. \"Fuck that silly kids!\" \"They destroyed my art. They 'll be dead right now\" \"Don't be such an idiot. We have to go now!\" \"Go where?\" It was hard for him to speak but he did. \"I don't know but...the game is not over\" \"I 'll kill them!\" \"You shut the fuck up! Hurry up…Take most of the shit we have and let's go!\" Vincent did as his brother said. His was watching his museum burning and he couldn't do a thing. The kids had left the town after they became sure the fire was approaching the Sinclair's house, too. Bo was already in his truck, after he had gone to his gas station to collect some things, when he saw Vincent coming. He got out and helped him carried their stuff. \"Get in before the cops come and find us here\" Bo said abruptly to his brother. Vincent got in the truck waiting for his brother. As he was walking to get into the car he smiled tortuously. \"I 'll find you babe…you and your whole company… \"Carly…Caaaarlyyyy….Carly get up!\" \"Oh my god Nick! What do you want!\" \"Get up honey….we wait Paige and Blake\" \"Why?\". Carly said sleepy. \"I don't know…she said to told us and Blake something\" \"Oooh…\" Carly said now completely awake from what she was listening. \"What 'Oooh' is supposed to mean?\" Nick said busy with his cigarettes. \"Ahhh..nothing! I just meant…nothing\" \"You illumined me with your clear answer\" Nick said sarcastically. \"Ah Nick what do you want! I am still upset and afraid…I can't forget about that freaks that fast\" \"How are they involved into what Paige wants to announce us! Nick said puzzled. \"You mean I know something about that matter and I am not telling you?\" \"Since when we tell everything to each other?\" Nick said slightly laughing as he was watching her being unsure about what she would answer. \"Since…when we managed to survive that freaky day\" \"Alright\" He ended the conversation. He heard the bell ringing and went to open the door leaving Carly alone to get dressed. As he was opened the door he joked. \"I am sorry we don't accept salesmans\" \"Aha!\" Blake murmured. \"Oh my god! What a joke!\" Paige commented with a fake smile. Carly was approaching after she had heard her. \"What's going on guys. I see you are in a very good mood\" \"Yes ,you are right I noticed that, too\" Nick said ironically. \"I must talk to you guys and especially to you Blake\" \"Oooh\" Carly said again\" \"That \"oooh\" again!\" Nick told to himself. \"What is it Paige?\" Blake asked his girlfriend. \"Com'on what is it babe….I'm so bored today that I…\" \"I am pregnant idiot!\" Paige said so fast because of Blake's irresponsible attidute. \"What?\" Blake stayed immobile. \"Oh my god…Carly that was \"oooh\"!\" Nick said in a stressful grin. \"Am Nick I think you should restore Blake\" \"Blake…Blake…come on there are matters worse than that\" Nick tried to comfort his friend. \"Blake…Blake…Is he alive?\" Carly said to her brother who was still trying to deal with Blake\" \"You shouldn't have told him that abrupt!\" \"Carly, you heard him? All he cares about is himself…and what am I supposed to do now?\" Paige said hopeless. \"There must be a solution, relax….'' \"Yeah there is. He have to marry her!\" \"Nick what are you saying? Would you do that if you were at my shoes?\" Blake asked panicked. \"I am not!\" Nick shouted. \"Paige babe are you sure? \" \"Yes, Blake. Now absolutely sure…I tried to tell you at the campside but…\" \"You were busy!\" Nick interrupted. \"Nick!\" Carly disapproved her brother. \"He is right Carly. It was a mistake…a terrible mistake\" \"I need to get some air!\" Blake said and left the house. \"That's it! Get away!\" Paige said as she was watching her boyfriend leaving. \"Alright friends…what am I doing now?\" Paige said with her hands covering her face. Nick and Carly sighed as they were looking at each other…[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 -The thirst for revenge I am sorry for any possible mistakes. Remember I do not own anything. \"Bo we shouldn't have left that town even the cops had to find us\" Lester told his brother who was not giving much attention to him. \"Bo I'm talking to you!\" \"Shut up! I am not going to jail and nobody of us you really think that I would stay there? With too much smoke they would find us with their eyes closed!\" \"And what are we going to do from now on? They 'll find us either\" \"Don't be silly Les, I won't let them. They destroyed Vincent's art…\" \"Do you really care about Vincent's work? Or is it an excuse?\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I say that you seem to hate him and be jealous because he is talented…\" \"Me? Jealous of him?\" Bo's anger grew because inside him he knew Lester was right. Even if he didn't hate him because of his talent he disliked him for being his mother's \"perfect\" child. The good boy who was always nice and quiet. The boy who made his brother seem an animal comparably with him. Despite the fact his face was blasted. \"Listen, he doesn't stop to be a freak…\" \"And what with that Bo, you are perfect, you are attractive and you would have a girl, a family but you destruct yourself and your life!\" \"Keep your mouth shut for a while, why did you start to talk about that things?\" \"Because I care about you and Vincent but the only thing Vincent can have is his art…his talent!\" \"Better you should care about yourself\" Bo stood up and went to find Vincent. Without knocking the door he got in his room. Actually it wasn't anything important, it was a small room like their whole house. They had found a remote place in order to prevent cops from finding them. \"Vincent, we have to find them\" Bo said rapidly to his still sad brother. \"Who?\" Vincent asked without really knowing what did he meant. \"Them…That kids who destroyed our town. Our lives\" \"Our lives were already destroyed\" He said as loudly as he could. \"What?\" Bo looked maddened at him. \"Forget it\" \"What do you have in your head, you and your other brother\" \"We have to revenge, do you understand that? Nobody wins me. Neither that little bitch nor her brother, nor her fucking friends\" \"We understood that Bo\" Lester had come and told standing at the door. \"We leave tomorrow\" Vincent looked at his twin brother with his eyes almost tearful, but they couldn't be revealed under his wax mask. He could see the evil in his brother's eyes but this time was not only evil. Bo was different. There was something he kept secret. There was something that was breaking his unscrupulous glance. The glance that chilled everyone's blood… 9 MONTHS LATER All those months he kept thinking. Thinking how he could take revenge from all those kids. And especially her. Her…Her who was like him. Her who by being the pure twin had made her brother seem inhuman. She was like him. He wanted Vincent to be enclosed to that town… he didn't want Vincent to be happy. She didn't want Nick to be better than her. She was worse than him… He had moved to New York, he was no wanted anymore. But he was close to his KILL THEM. Every minute that passed he wanted to find them and send them to hell…He was so close…he had already found them. After all those years he had managed to find them. But that was the time to approach…The time to attack. Paige had brought to world a girl. Blake was not there as he was supposed to be. But she decided to give birth to that child. It wasn't its fault, but hers. Her friends were there. Carly and Nick supported her everyday, every hour, every minute. They were always there for her. But she was feeling she was alone. Even her parents did't want to help her. Her friends was her only family. \"Hi sweetie, how are you?\" Carly asked her friend who was still tired after giving birth. \"Well, I suppose\" \"I know, it is hard but, to be honest I couldn't sleep.\" Carly said with a fake smile trying to make Paige laugh. \"Hi girls…\" Nick told entering the room. \"How is our mummy today. I know it's late but I can't sleep tonight?\" Nick said kissing Paige's forehead. \"Fine\" She answered at one word. \"Aren't you a little happy? Don't you want to see your baby tomorrow?\" Nick answered surprised after seeing Paige be that cold. \"Nick, I am alone and this baby cannot erase my past\" \" Paige you are its mother you have to care about it and…\" \"Blake ought to be here, either\" Carly interrupted her brother. \"Carly he doesn't deserve it, he is weak and unable to come to see his baby. He is not a man. And he is not my friend anymore\" \"I agree but…\" \"But what?, he is a timid!\" \"Stop that please!\" Paige shouted and covered herself with the hospital blanket turning her back to her friends. \"Let's go\" Carly said angrily to her brother and they took their disagreement outside the room. \"You can't act kindly as a normal person , you always have to be rough. \"Yeah, you are always the pretty girl with a smile and I am always the toughie\" Nick smiled ironically to his sister. \"Grow up, how many times I have to tell you that you have to grow up!\" \"Shut up!\" Nick eventually told his sister and left the hospital. Carly sat down remembering her and Nick fighting that night at the campsite. Suddenly her mind jumped from that moment to another, when Bo kissed her forehead. \"Oh my god that idiot again!\" She was brought back to reality really upset. \"Why do I always have to remember him, why?\" She closed her eyes and touched her head to the wall. It was late and she was the only one who was there. Or…so she thought.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 - I found you \"Oh my god!\" Carly shouted when she realized who was next to- and then behind her, holding her mouth shut. \"Shhhhh…why are you afraid? Of me?\" Bo asked her knowing that she was really scared. He knew he was her worst nightmare… \"What are you doing here…are you alive?\" She screamed again, being surprised by seeing him alive but he covered her mouth again when he saw a nurse looking at them. \"First of all, don't shout, we are in a public place and I don't want any fucking nurse or doctor looking at me\" Bo kept talking with angst pulling her every time closer to him. \"Be a nice girl as you are supposed to be. Don't ruin your image\" Bo told smiling at her. \"What do you want from me?\" She asked panicked. \"I want you to come with me\" He answered to her question knowing her reaction. \"No way!\" She said whispering, as she were told to. \"Come with me. I am not gonna hurt you…I promise. Not yet\" He said enjoying that situation. \"Why?\" She told crying and lost. \"Let's go\" He finally said. \"No, talk to me here\" She told again trying to avoid going anywhere else with him. This man was freaking her out. Suddenly Bo pushed her away from him and walked to leave the place. \"We are not finished. And don't say to anyone you saw me. I am going to come to see you again\" That was the last phrase he said and turned to leave. She sat down and started to cry harder that earlier. \"Why…why did he have to find me…Why?\" She closed her eyes when she eventually fell asleep. After his disagreement with his sister and after a lot of walking, Nick decided to have a drink. He got in a bar, it was almost empty, there were three or four people, he sat and he ordered a drink. If Carly was there would told him not to drink or that he would end up an alcoholic and such things. His sister was supposed to be steady and reasponsible. He was supposed to be bad-tempered, to drink, to fight with everyone. Actually, he didn't know if she was right or if she wanted to make him seem second. He didn't know if he hated her or If he just disliked her. He was confused. He also remembered the tragic experience they had, trying to escape from Ambrose. They were together, they wouldn't leave each other. But now it was the same. The same cold atmosphere. All were the same. Except his friend, Dalton. He dad lost him and he was broken. He was sad even for Wade. After all he was a good guy. Maybe he didn't liked him that much because he was with his sister. But now it wasn't matter. But he also knew his sister was in love with him even if she wasn't showing it that much. Wade had got in her heart and Nick knew she was heavy-hearted he weren't with her now. He was brought back from his thoughts when a girl talked to him. \"Could I sit with you?\" She said smiling at him. She was sweet, pretty, tall with black hair and eyes and she was thin. She seemed to be friendly. \"Are you talking to me?\" He asked startled. \"Yes, you are the only one sitting here\" She said keep smiling. \"Well, yes you can sit with me\" He said not seem well. \"Do you have problems?\" \"Me? Many\" He said lightly grinning. \"Mmmm…is it a girl?\" She asked quit interested. \"No, I wish it was that\" \"Don't say that. It is hard to lose a companion\" \"Have you lost a boyfriend?\" Nick asked concerned. \"Yeah but it's 3 months ago\" She said to him, her warm smile wasn't there anymore. \"I am sorry\" Nick told feeing like he was the one who had left that girl. \"You?\" \"Me what?\" \"I told you my problem, tell me yours\" She said really wanting to know about him. \"It is a very very long story…not 3 months ago. A lifetime ago. And especially when my sister and I went to high school\" \"Do you have a sister?\" \"Yes, a twin sister\" \"Oh my god is she that good-looking like you?\" Nick looked at her smiling. \"Oops I am sorry, I didn't…go on…\" She said embarrassed. \"Well, we are not that affected twins. If you got me\" \"Yes, I know.\" \"My sister used to be the good twin and me the evil. That was enough to destroy our relationship\" \"Well, I am sorry, too\" \"All that time I am talking to a stranger. What is your name?\" \"Vanessa. And yours?\" \"Nick\" He said without hesitating. \"Well, nice to meet you Nick\" \"Nice to meet you, Vannie, can I call you like that?\" Nick asked that girl who had changed his bad attitude that night. \" You can call me like that. Would you like to go for a walk?\" \"Definitely\" What a nice ending to tasteless night. Nick thought and went to walk with Vannie. That unexpected girl who had managed to make his night obtain essence. Who knows? Maybe she could have the ability to fix all his future days and nights. Maybe she could fix his whole life…[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 – Fear and Agony Today I had my first comment about my -non so satisfying I could say-story and that makes me write another chapter of that. So, here you are! The next morning Nick went at the hospital to see Paige again and he found his sister sleeping on the floor near a chair. \"Car, hey Car wake up\" He said surprised. He thought that their fight last night made his sister stay at that situation. \"Carly please wake up, why did you sleep in here\" \"He came again, Nick he came again\" She whispered intimidated. \"Who? Who came?\" Nick asked his sister confused. When Carly was totally awake she thought about what happened last night and she decided to keep that moment secret. Although she was afraid she couldn't talk, not only because Bo had told her not to, but also she didn't want to worry her brother and especially Paige. \"Carly will you tell me? What happened? Who came and when?\" Nick tried another time to take an answer from his sister but he failed. \"The doctor who wanted to see Paige\" Carly tried to overturn what she had just said. \"And is this so bad? I mean wasn't he supposed to come?\" \"No, it's ok. I was a little bit obsessive\" \"Are you ok now?\" \"Yeah Nick thanks\" \"The doctor is going to have a last look on Paige and we are going to go home\" \"Nick what about her parents?\" Carly asked knowing that Paige's parents wouldn't like their daughter and her baby to live with them. They had never accept that situation. \"She will definitely live with us. We can't leave her alone now\" Nick had shown, even the bad image he presented to others, that he was very reasponsible and that he would be a perfect father and husband. He hadn't talked to his sister about Vannie yet and he didn't know if he wanted to. \"Yes, I think so, but is it right?\" \"Yes it is. I'm sure\" \"Alright\" They ended their discussion and they headed to Paige's room. \"Good morning honey\" Carly said to her friend who seemed to be better than yesterday. \"Hi…\" Nick said with a warm smile, too. \"You seem much better today\" Carly commented. \"I am…I saw my little girl today…Nick she is beautiful, you were so right!\" Paige said to Nick who was sitting next to her. \"I told you that little blond goofy\" Nick joked. \"I'm so happy you feel like that\" Carly encouraged her friend. \"I'm happy, too. After all I gave Blake great importance and he didn't deserve it. I'll grow up my baby on my own\" \"Not on your own, with us\" Nick ended. \"What?\" Paige asked quit surprised. \"Yes, with us\" Carly smiled to her still surprised friend. \"Are you serious?\" Paige asked her friends in disbelief. She didn't know what to say, how to thank them. They were willing to help her raise her child without having any responsibility. She was speechless. \"This child is gonna grow up with all of us. Next to Carly's and my children. And don't cry because I will cry, too\" Nick said to Paige who was ready to tear. Carly walked closer and she hugged them, they did the same. They were ready to take their lives to their hands. But into all those things Carly was thinking about Bo. What was he going to do? She knew he was dangerous. He was haunting her life. But she didn't want to destroy the great atmosphere among them. She had to handle that, to be strong. \"We have to leave now. I want to go home\" Paige said. \"What about the doctors?\" Carly asked. \"They came early this morning. The only thing we have to do is to take my release card and go\" \"I'll go take it\" Nick said and left the room. Carly didn't really paid much attention and Paige had noticed that. \"Carly are you ok?\" \"What?\" \"I asked if you are ok…\" \"I'm sorry I didn't hear that\" \"I know you didn't hear that you act like you are not here. Please tell me what's your problem?\" Paige really wanted to help her best friend but actually she had no idea about what was happening with her. \"Paige I'm fine, don't worry\" \"Sure?\" \"Yes….I'm sure. I'm sure. Carly told it twice because even she-herself- didn't believe that. The time had passed it was getting dark when Nick finally entered the room. \"I'm here girls at last, let's go\" Nick interrupted. \"Perfect\" Paige said because she wanted to leave that dull place. \"Let's go then\" Carly said and left the room first. \"Nick, wait a minute, I think something happened to her and I am very upset\" Paige informed Nick about Carly's bad attitude. But Nick was upset, too although he didn't show that. \"Did she tell you something?\" \"No, she says she is ok\" \"She is not. I found her sleeping here in the morning and she was very afraid. She tried to hide it but…anyway we'll see. Let's go now\" \"Alright\" They left the hospital room and they returned home. They got in and Nick sat on the couch. Carly had gone directly to her room quit surly while Paige had firstly placed her daughter on the crib Nick had bought for her. She was so beautiful Paige thought. She was small she was still afraid to hold her. After that she sat with Nick for a while. Nick and Paige were worried about Carly. \"Your daughter is beautiful\" Nick smiled to Paige and she did the same. \"She is but I worry about Carly\" \"Me too\" \"I need to sleep. Goodnight\" She lifted to go to her bedroom. \"Oh Nick, thanks for the crib. I appreciate this\" \"You are welcome. It is your house now and she is my nephew. \"Thanks. Goodnight\" \"Goodnight Paige\" Nick was thinking about his sister again. She had changed since yesterday. Was it because of their fight? No, Nick thought. They had been fighting so many times. So what was her problem, her fear. Because She was not angry, she was he was sunken inside his thoughts and after the girls had gone to sleep he heard the door knocking. It was late. \"Who the hell is at 3:00 pm!\" He headed to the door. He opened but he couldn't believe in his eyes. \"Blake…what are you doing here?\" Nick was angry and surprised at the same moment. \"Hi Nick, I felt the need to come…I was wrong…\" Paige was coming and she stood a few steps behind Nick. \"What are you doing here judas?\" \"You don't belong here anymore Blake, you don't…\" Nick said with his eyes misty.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 – The accident Here is the 7th chapter of my story…Remember I only own the plot of this story, so please don't sue. \"You are not acceptable in here Blake\" Nick said to his ex-friend. \"Nick I want to talk to you and especially to you Paige\" Blake tried to excuse himself. \"To say what? That you heard about my pregnancy and you left me alone? And what do you want now? To forgive you? Well I won't. So you can leave us alone now\" Paige said to her daughter's father. That was hurting her but she didn't want to give in. \"I think you took your answer\" Nick said to him angrily. \"What's going on?\" Carly had woken up and when she saw her friend she felt strangely. \" Blake? What are you doing in here. I thought you had already forgotten us. Did you find a new girlfriend who doesn't want to be officially with you?\" Carly said wild. \"I just want to talk to you Paige! I have to say sorry!\" \"Well I don't want to, so leave me alone\" \"We are not finished. I'll return because I really love you Paige\" \"Get out!\" She shouted and she pushed him outside. She slapped the door. \"Oh my god that's horrible!\" Carly told her friend and run to comfort her. \"That's pathetic…\" Paige said regretfully and she went to her bedroom. \"Oh Nick what was that. Another problem now…\" \"What is the other problem you have?\" \"I'll try to sleep\" She said to avoid him and went to leave. He gently pulled her from her arm and placed her to face him. \"Carly tell me what's going on with you…please\" \"Nick what do you want to know, I AM FINE!\" Carly said vexed. \"YOU ARE NOT!\" Nick shouted at her. \"You are not well and it is apparent\" \"I 'll tell you Nick. Once I will\" She went to sleep. Nick was pondering but he decided to give her time. He went to sleep, too. It was a difficult day. The next morning they were all more smooth. The girls decided to stay home and devote a little time to the baby. Nick decided to call Vannie. She had given him her phone number in order to meet him again. He wanted to see her. He called her and they arranged to meet to the same bar. That girl had really took his heart and he would tell her. Today. It was the first time he wanted to have a serious relationship. After their adventure in Ambrose he had changed a lot. He had become more responsible, ready to face his life. He greeted the girls and he went to that bar as fast as he could. He got in and he saw her…she was so beautiful .She was already sitting and waiting for him. The first time someone waited for him. He didn't wasted more time and he approached her. \"Hi, Vannie\" Nick said with his warmest smile. \"Hi ,Nick\" Vanessa said with a tender smile, too. \"I am so glad we met again…and…\" \"Nick, I am glad we met, too and…I just want to be with you always…I don't know what is happening to me but…I think I 'm in love with you…I am sorry\" \"Why are you sorry? Vannie I want you, too. I want to be with you for the rest of my silly life…\" Nick said hoping Vannie wouldn't turned him down. \"Nick, what are you saying…\" She told him with a sunny grin. \"Yeah, why are you laughing? My life is silly. My life is empty and I want you to fill it\" Nick said wishful. He had fall in love with that girl and he wanted to share his life with her. \"Nick, you don't have to say anything else to me…I started this because I want you. I love you. I don't know if this is kind of silly because this is the second time I meet you but…I love the way you look at me. I love your face\" \"Vannie, do you want to be my girlfriend?\" Nick asked Vannie with his blue eyes flashing. \"Of course I do\" She said to him her voice shivering from happiness. Nick kissed her forehead with his eyes closed, enjoying every bit of her skin. Then, he slowly reached her lips and kissed it. His heart was gonna break from beating so quickly. Vanessa body was gonna break down. Nick's kiss had managed to numb it. \"I love you Vannie…\" \"I love you Nick…\" \"Oh my god Paige what are you doing!\" Carly said laughing so hard that you could say the pedestrians could hear her. \"Making you laugh!\" Paige had dressed her baby into a clown dress and she had made her pigtailed with a cue with rabbit ears. \"Are you serious? What are you doing to this little angel!\" Carly said still short of breath and taking the baby from her best friend. \"At least I made you laugh\" \"Aha, I needed this. Well what name are you gonna give to her\" Carly asked giving a big kiss to the little baby and holding it affectionately. \"Mmmm, actually I don't know, I have to think about it. And what is your opinion sexy godmother?\" Paige said grinning at her. \"What? Are you serious? I mean I thought you wanted Nick to be her godfather\" \"Yes I thought about that but I decided that Nick should be her uncle. You are my best friend\" \"Thanks Paige, you make me really happy…\" Carly said really excited to her friend. \"Well you can choose a name for her…\" Paige said letting her friend decide her baby's name. \"Andie which means that she'll be a warrior. Stronger and luckier than us\" Carly said thinking about her sad past. \"Carly are you ok?\" Paige said sad and confused. \"Yeah Paige I am fine. Go for a walk. I take care of her\" \"Alright… take her of Andie. I'll leave you alone with her\" Paige said melancholically. She took her coat and left the house. Carly looked at the baby she was holding for a last time and then she went to place her to her crib. When the baby slept she took her clothes off and went to have a shower. When she finished she put on some warm and cosy clothes and couched to Paige's bed in order to be close to the baby. She was almost to sleep when the phone rang. Carly jerked a little and she hesitated to answer it. But then she thought that it must be Nick so she decided to answer. \"Hello?\" Carly said a little bit sleepy. \" Hi, love did you forget me? Because I didn't\" Carly started to tremble. It was this man again. This man who had spoiled her life. She tried to be strong and answered. \"Bo, is this you?\" She asked trying not to sound scared. \"I am glad you remember me. I like that you called me with my name. I want you to call me with my name\" \"Look I…\" Carly was ready to talk to Bo when Nick interrupted her. \"Carly did you sleep?\" \"No, I…\" \"Are you talking with Paige?\" \"Yes\" \"Give the phone I want to tell her something…\" \"NO!\" Carly shouted at him. \" Well, I am going to call you another time. Bye honey\" \"What's wrong with you Carly?\" Nick asked his sister puzzled. \"Nothing, ah she just…hung up!\" Carly tried to stay calm. \"Alright. Did the baby sleep?\" \"Andie\" \"What?\" \"We named her Andie. Do you know what Andie means?\" Carly asked her brother almost teared. \"What?\" Nick asked perplexed. \"A warrior…she will be stronger than me…\" \"Carly, YOU ARE STRONG. We 've managed many difficult situations that hurt both of us. You are a warrior, too\" Nick said and held his sister to his arms. \"I am afraid Nick…\" Carly said with misty eyes. \"There is no reason to be afraid, I am with you. I 'll always be\" \"Thanks brother\" Carly said and hugged him again. They were quite relaxed when suddenly the phone rang again. \"Who is this\" Nick asked curious. \"Don't answer it\" Carly said afraid. \"Why, it must be Paige\" \"Nick please…\" \"Carly just stay calm. It'll be ok\" Nick said and answered the phone. \"Hello? Yes I am her friend. What is it…? What are you saying? Are you serious?\" Nick seemed frightened. \"Nick, what is it?\" Carly asked after seeing her brother being pale. \"Yes we will come right now\" Nick said and hung up the phone. \"Nick tell me what is it!\" Carly asked confused. \"Paige…she had an accident and she is at the hospital\" \"Nick…\" \"Shhh…don't worry. We are going to get over this, as we always do\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 - Who are you? This is my 8th chapter of my story…I want to thank Ghostwriter for the reviews and I want to say sorry about deleting and republishing this story. Some silly mistakes that I notice after I 've added the chapters. I try to control any possible mistakes. I didn't write for a long time because I have school now and to be honest I am a little bored. Anyway enjoy the sequel. Sorry for the big prologue. Nick and Carly run immediately to the hospital where Paige were attended. Paige…Paige was already hurt by her fate because of a mistake. Blake had left her , her parents did the same and now this. But Paige was not only their friend…after all that they had passed together she was their sister. Carly was laying on Nick's arms waiting to hear that Paige was fine. Nick was thinking the same but he was thinking Vanessa, too. Vanessa was his big sweet secret that he still didn't tell to his sister…his sister…Nick looked at an exhausted and disappointed Carly who was in his hands and he hesitatingly gentled her hair. His parents weren't with them after they had moved to New York and he was the only one who was able and should protect his twin sister. They had moved out because they wanted to have a new start to their lives after their graduation and because they wanted to forget about their past…the past which was still haunting them. \"Is she ok?\" Carly hopped of Nick's arms and asked the doctor who had just got out of Paige's room. \"Yes, she is but it was caused a temporary blindness from the hit\" The doctor explained. \"Blindness?\" Nick asked surprised. \"Oh my god!\" Carly sighed and covered her face with her hands. \"Could we see her?\" Nick asked. \"Of course, I guess it will be very good for her to hear you\" \"Thank you\" Nick said and touched Carly's face.\" Carly what are you thinking?\" \"Nothing\". Of course she lied to him. \"Let's go see her\" They opened the door of Paige's room and they found her crying. Nick felt pain…pain because he couldn't do anything for her. \"Paige, calm down\" Carly said not to seem that she was crying. \"I am blind\" Paige said with tears crossing the distance in her eyes. \"No you are not!\" Carly said trying to comfort her. \"It is temporary\" Nick repeated. He really didn't know what to say. \"They always say so in order not to scare people\" She answered. \"No, no!\" Nick said and hugged her. \"Why, why?\" Carly said with her eyes closed and she was thinking that maybe Bo was hiding behind all these. But she still couldn't say anything because he would do much more harm to her brother or Paige. She sat on the edge of the table and ran her fingers through her curly hair. She had to somehow deal with that situation. Bo was sitting on the armchair of his new-little house in New York. He was not used to living in such a big town. It was something completely different . He was holding a gun and he was playing with it while he was listening to marilyn manson. His blue was shining and he was very thoughtful. If Carly or anyone else could see him right now they would say that he was going to kill again. And he would… He wanted to shot Nick in head, kill that little slut and her stupid boyfriend and torture Carly like Hell. That would be his favorite. He had tortured another women, too, but with her it was different. His pleasure was bigger and he wanted more and more…again and again. He would do that quit soon. Vincent cut his thoughts. \"What do you want now?\" Bo asked him angrily. \"I want to go out\" Vincent told with a scratched voice. \"What? What the fuck Vincent? It's 2:00pm \" Bo told him really astonished. \"That's why I want to go out right now, I'll be very careful\" Vincent ensured his brother. \"Fine, do whatever you want\" Bo finally said. Vincent opened the door and left. Bo rested his head on the back of the armchair more relaxed and innocuous and he thought loudly \" What is Miss Carly doing right know?\" \"Nick, take Carly and go home now\" Paige said to her friends. \"No, I'll stay here\" Carly said immediately. \"Come on Carly, go home. Besides I'll return home tomorrow. Take her of my little baby and give it a kiss from me\" Paige said with a warm smile. \"She is right, I 'll come and take her tomorrow\" Nick said to his sister. \"Alright then\" Carly agreed. \"I'll take care of your baby as if it was mine\" Carly looked at Nick and gave him a little smile. They said their goodnights and they left the room. Paige decided to try to get some sleep. It was hard but she had to. After a while she heard the door opening and she sat down on her bed a little frightened. Someone approached her and suddenly kissed her softly. It was a real kiss. When they stopped for air she asked him puzzled \" Blake, is this you?...\" PLEASE REVIEW[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 - Confusions and mistakes Hi! This is the next chapter of my story for those who want to know the sequel…I know it's completely different from the movie but I wanted to write a story a little bit unusual. Anyways… \"Blake is this you?\" Paige asked both curious and a little bit afraid. The unknown man didn't talk to her. He abruptly pulled his hand away from hers, opened the door and left the room. \"Wait, I want to know who you are…please!\" Paige asked again louder. But she didn't received an answer. She rested her head on her pillow and thought loudly. \"What was that now?\" The next morning Nick went at the hospital, as he had promised Paige. He got in her room and he smiled at her. \" Good morning\" \"Good morning\" She said to him with a fake grin on her face. \"That grin isn't real at all\" Nick told her almost sure that something had happened to her. \"I'm fine Nick\" Paige ensured him. \"Ok. I believe you\" Nick didn't insist because he didn't want to upset her. After a while Nick saw Paige goggling her eyes with happiness. \"Nick… Nick I can see you. I can see you again!\" \"I told you, you see? Nick approached her and kissed her forehead.\" I'm so happy for you Paige. I wouldn't resist if you stayed blind forever\" \"Nick, are you ok? Is there something that I have to know about you?\" \"No, I'm fine Paige. Are you ready to go home?\" Nick gave her an innocent look. \"Of course\" Paige smiled at him… Carly sat on the couch of her big and warm apartment in New York and let her blond Carly hair touch her shoulders. She had been waiting for her brother and friend to return but all that time was endless and she was always thoughtful. She was always trying to forget about that immature and dangerous psycho but she couldn't. She wanted to find a way to save her brother, her friends, her life. She wanted to make him disappear. But she couldn't. Suddenly she saw the door opening and she stood up quickly. \"Paige!\" Carly said and run to hug her friend. \"Carly, I see you…\" Paige said and hugged her best friend, too. \"So ladies, I think it's time to tell you something\" Nick said ready to reveal them that he was in love. \"What is it Nick? Carly said upset without knowing what Nick wanted to told them. \"Well, I'm in love\" Nick said without delay. The girl stayed speechless. \"What?\" Carly said with a wide smile and she run to hug her twin brother.\" Nick are you serious? I'm so glad for you…Who is that girl. \"Is it a friend of us…? I mean do we know her?\" Paige asked quite curious. \"No no, but she is an incredible girl. Actually I don't know her very well neither does she but we fell in love immediately… I don't know how that happened\" Nick explained. \"And are we supposed to meet her?\" Carly asked her brother. \"Of course. Pretty soon\" Nick told with his hands in his pockets. \"Well guys I want to tell you something, too\" Paige started. \"Oh, is it a revelation day?\" Carly asked joking. Actually she was the only one who hadn't revealed her secret which was much worse than Nick's or Paige's. \"Last night, when I was about to sleep, someone got into my room and…\" \"And?\" Nick asked with his usual cold air when he felt that something serious was going to happen. \"He kissed me\" Paige ended. \"What? Who was he?\" Nick said almost angry. \"Nick calm down\" Carly interfered in order to calm her brother. \"I mean, you kissed a stranger?\" He couldn't believe what Paige had told him. \"Nick, he kissed me, not me, and I couldn't see who he was. Besides when I asked him if he was Blake he didn't answer and left\" Paige tried to explain him. But she was not completely honest. Even though she didn't know that man she felt very specially. \"That's weird\" Carly said. \"Did you call Blake?\" Nick asked Paige. \"No, and I don't want to\" Paige said stubbornly. \"Paige, you have to know, I'll call him\" Nick told her determined. \"Why? And what are you going to tell him? That someone stranger kissed me? And if he was not the one who came last night?\" Paige asked him again but Carly tried to convince her. \"Paige, it will be ok. Let Nick handle it\" \"Alright. I'll go call him right now. And don't worry , I will not inform him about that kiss. That would make him mad\" Nick told the girls and left the living room. When they stayed alone Paige decided to confess Carly her real feelings. \"Carly I want to say to you the truth. I felt so wonderful, I felt like I knew him. \"But you didn't and you don't know\" \"Yes and I'm quite sure that he wasn't Blake\" \"Really? I mean how do you know that? Carly asked her friend confused. \"I felt it\" Paige told her. And she was right. That man wasn't Blake. He was a stranger. Or maybe a stranger… Carly went to her bedroom after her conversation with Paige. She was interested in what Paige was saying but in reality she was afraid. She couldn't forget about him. He still existed. He hadn't died that day. He was still alive ready to destroy her life. She hated him. Yes, she hated him so much that he made her crazy. She hated him because he had killed Wade and Dalton. Because if he hadn't killed Wade, she would have been with him right now and if he hadn't killed Dalton, Nick wouldn't have lost his best friend. It was already getting dark. It was winter. It was 7:00 pm. She decided to go for a walk. She had a quick shower and she dried her hair. She wore a simple black dress and a grey jacket to prevent the sharp cold. She looked gorgeous even with those simple clothes. She took her keys and without saying a thing she got out. She was walking and walking, she passed big buildings, houses and shops, parks and dazzling neons. New York was everybody's dream. Her dream…But she couldn't live it. After half an hour of walking she stopped and sat on a bench. She decided to stay there because the place was remote and quiet. She was admiring the great view when she suddenly heard steps behind her. There was deep quiet, that's why she could hear them clearly. She turned and she saw Bo standing behind her with a small smile. \"So, here I 'm again\" He told her enjoying every moment. \"I for real didn't expecting you\" She told him. She panicked but she didn't want to give him that pleasure. \"Are you following me?\" \"I'm very close to you. I told you that we have not finished\" Bo told starting to get serious. \"Leave me alone, for god's sake, leave me alone…\" She said. Her physic power was ready to abandon her. She tried to leave. \"Not that quickly\" He said and held her hands tight. \"Just leave me alone, please\" She said again trying to get away from him, but he was stronger than her. He couldn't shut her mouth and he abruptly put his lips on hers forcefully. She tried to break the kiss but it was unavailing. Finally she managed to free her hands and run away. Bo didn't run after her . He only watched her. After she had reached a place quit far from him she sat at a corner and she started to cry. Bo he couldn't believe what he had just done. He wasn't the type of man who gave in into circumstances like that. He hit the bench as strongly as he could and he sat on its back. In the end he loudly told to himself \"What do you Bo Sinclair, what do you finally want…?\"[Chapter 10] Yeah another review! That's why I decided to write chapter 10… Anyway thanks! \"No you are not gonna give in. You're gonna have her but you're not gonna lose yourself…She'll pay!\" Bo told to himself and his eyes got wide. He was gonna complete his diabolic plan no matter what. Carly took her way home. She opened the door and she saw Nick sitting on the couch and waiting for her. She felt quit uncomfortably and tried to avoid him. Pointless. \"Where have you been?\" He asked both worried and angry. \"I went to walk. To think alone\" \"Carly there is something I have to know. And you'll tell me right now\" Nick said angrily. \"I don't understand you\" She kept playing it unaware. \"You do\" \"Nick please I don't wanna talk. So leave me alone\" She said more bloodless than ever. It scared him. What did she have in her mind. Was she going crazy? \"Goodnight Carly\" He told but she wasn't listening anymore…She put her pajamas on and she lied down her bed. She wasn't thinking anymore. She wasn't scared. She closed her eyes and sleep took her. The clock read 7:30. Carly woke up and step into the shower. The cold water run all over her body but she didn't mind. She had the need of a cold shower. After that she dressed up and went to the kitchen. She took a bowl and poured some cereals in it. She sat down when she saw Nick entering the room. Paige was coming after him. \"Good morning\" Paige said a little bit hesitatingly. There was silent for a while when Nick started. \"It wasn't Blake\" His voice was gentle that they hardly heard him. \"I knew it\" Paige answered. \"So? Who was it?\" He asked. \"I 'm not sure but…I think it was the man who tried to kill me\" \"Vincent?\" Nick asked surprised and Carly looked at her panicked. She was afraid that her secret was gonna be reviled soon. \"You must be crazy…\" She told trying to seem calm. \"I'm almost sure. I recognized his smell and his hair was long\" \"How could he…\" Nick started but Paige cut him. \"Nick, that's not impossible!\" Paige shouted. Yes it was not impossible and he knew it. He just didn't want to believe that that freak was still alive. He wanted to protect her and his sister. His head was heavy and he didn't know what to do to. He didn't want to live that again. He couldn't stand it. Bo sat down and took a large gulp of his cold drink. He was thinking about the events that happened yesterday. He wanted to return to his old town, to his old house. Vincent came and sat next to him. \"What?\" Bo asked. \"I went to find her\" Vincent told immediately. \"Who?\" Bo's anger grew as he was listening. \"The girl. The tall one\" \"What the fuck Vincent! What do you have in your head!\" Bo stood up throwing the glass. Vincent looked at the floor. He didn't want to face his mad brother. Bo went to his room and grabbed his cellphone. He called Carly but she didn't answer. \"Fuck you!\" He told and threw the phone on his bed.[Chapter 11] From now on the chapters will be in character's POV. Remember: I only own the plot of this for the reviews and for the interest. Carly's Pov I finished my breakfast and I got dressed.I had to decide what I was gonna do with my life. I wanted to go to another place in order to find a decent job.I didn't know if Paige and Nick wanted to come with me. It would be great but we had already moved once. But I would go anyway. This was a way to get lost and won't see Bo again if that was not pointless. He would find me anywhere. I took my jacket and I went to talk to Paige. Maybe she would understand. She had to. I felt dizzy as I was approaching her. How would I tell her? \"Paige\" I told with a hoarse voice. She didn't answered. She was angry. \"Paige, please. I'm sorry. I was not well that's why I didn't talk to you earlier\" I told to her feeling gruesomely about myself. \"I'm afraid you're not well pretty often Carly. And I don't know why\" \"I'll tell you but please, please don't tell anyone a word. Nick is gonna be mad\" I said ready to reveal her the truth. \"What is it?\" She looked at me worried. \"Bo is alive\" I had told it. Finally I had told it. Her blue eyes got wide and I felt her fear in all over my body. She was as afraid as I was. \"Bo who?\" She asked knowing that the question was stupid and unavailing. \"Bo who we all know and who we wouldn't like to know\" I added feeling my hatred for him boiling in my heart and blood. \"Have you seen him?\" She asked shoving her hair away from her face. \"Of course. He called me first and then we met. He wanted to\" \"Any you went to meet him!\" \"What could I do?\" \"After that I know for sure who was the man who went to my room\" Paige said and I was sure about what she was going to tell. \"That was Vincent. That's not impossible. If Bo managed to survive then Vincent did, too\" The danger was double for us. The evil brother would do everything to hurt us. I turned my face and I saw Nick coming. I gave him a weak smile. I knew I had made him feel bad. I felt like shit. \"Nick when are we going to meet your girlfriend?\" Paige asked to break the ice. We had ignored him a lot these days and he didn't deserve that. He had changed his attitude. He was not the bad boy anymore. He wanted to take care of us. To love. And he had managed it. I couldn't destroy it now with my idiotic behavor. \"Nick I really want to meet her\" I ensured him. He came and sat net to me. He hugged me and I closed my eyes feeling guilty. I shouldn't have lied to him after all that we'd passed. I broke his embrace and stood up. \"I'm gonna leave New York\" I told without hesitating. Everyone looked at me surprised. \"Why?\" Nick asked me. \"Because I want to work\" I was not sure about what was telling. \"You could find a job here\" He insisted but I continued. \"It would be better to a different place\" \"What's wrong? That was your dream Carly. You wanted to move to New York, to work here, to live your life here\" Nick protested. And he was right. I was not making sense. \"I changed my mind and I was wondering if any of you wanted to follow me\" \"No, Carly. I won't\" He told abruptly and left the room. He didn't even think it. Paige gave me a disappointing look. \"I'm afraid no one can follow you Carly. It's not easy. Please stay with us\" She begged. I didn't hold and I felt tears rolling from my eyes. I left her alone and I got in my room slamming the door. I sat down at the bed and buried my face into my hands. After a while I took my cell phone in my hands and I saw a call. It was from Bo. I called him back. He didn't answered.\"Call me jerk!\" I told to myself. After a while he called me back. \"Hello?\" I quickly answered. I was hearing him speaking and my heart was going to break. He was calmest than ever. He wanted to meet me. To his apartment. I was afraid but I had to go. Maybe I could go and kill him somehow. But there was Vincent and he would guard him with his life. I didn't know what to do. \"Ok. I'll come\" That was my last phrase. He told me where I could find him. I was sure that his house was a scary place like the old one. Anyway I wanted to go. To stop this. That was strange. I thought New York was only good things. But my fairytale had gone... That was quit short. The next chapter will be longer.[Chapter 12] Here is chapter 12. Nick's POV My sister was mad. What was going on with her? I thought she needed a doctor. She was strange and she didn't tell me why. I had to meet Vanessa. I would ask her to marry me. I knew that it wasn't the perfect time but I couldn't neglect her anymore. She was my girlfriend and I had to do something for her. Maybe I should talk to a doctor about Carly. That experience had caught her a trauma. I wanted her to relax, to go on with her life. It was difficult. I had fallen in love. She had lost her lifelong boyfriend Wade. That was terrific. She wanted to live with him, to make a family with him. But that was just a dream now. A dream that had been destroyed and a memory that kept broking her heart even after all that time. Paige brought me back to reality. \"Nick, do you know where Carly is?\" She asked me. I had no idea. \"What do you mean? Isn't she in her bedroom?\" I asked hoping that she hadn't looked at Carly's bedroom yet. \"No, I thought you would know\" \"What's wrong with her Paige? You must know\" She looked at me and then she turned her head to look at the other side of the room. \"So?\" I insisted. \"Nick, I don't know what she has. She must be stressed. But I don't know\" \"I don't believe you\" She was lying. \"You have to believe me Nick\" She ensured me. \"It's ok\" I didn't pressed her . But she hadn't persuaded me. Carly was not well and I would prove it. I wanted to help her… Bo's POV I waited for her. She was going to come. I was sure. I wanted to see her. To feel the fear she felt when she saw me. To see in her eyes the pain she felt for her friend's lost lives. I was evil. I wanted to make people pay. Pay for my mother's mistakes. For the scars I still had on all over my body. Yes, I had a heart of steel. And I knew it. I killed for fun. I killed people to feel alive, to feel that I'm strong. And I was. No one wins me. I would make that girl pay. I liked her. The smell of her hair, the way her lips curved. I was gonna have her. But I was gonna take my time. That was the best game I ever had. She was beautiful. I was evil. She was pure. I was devil. I wanted to kill her and her stupid brother. To leave them breathless. I heard a knock on the door. It was her. Vincent was in his room and Lester had gone out. I approached the door and sighed heavily. I opened the door. I saw her. Her eyes were red but she wasn't crying. She looked at me with fear, trying not to show it. But I knew what she felt. \"You are brave\" I teased her and she got in. That was a surprise. She didn't hesitate to get in my house. \"Why did you want me to come here? And by the way, your place is freaky. Freaky and gruesome like the old one\" She said and I wanted to strangle her. \"You should be more kind to me darling\" I tried to touch her cheek but she avoided it. She was audacious and that made me crazier. \"I'm not like you, but I can turn if I want\" She snapped and I pushed her, tossing her on the wall. I got a small knife out of my pocket and I put it so close to her neck that it almost cut her skin. She was sobbing and I held her face very near to mine. The more I tightened the more she was aching. I looked at her deep blue eyes and I whispered to her ear. \"I'm stronger than you and you can't defeat it\" I heard her crying harder and harder and that brought me back memories. When she first came in town and I strapped her to the chair, down at the basement of my gas station. \"Tell this to me again\" I ordered her.\"Tell me that I'm stronger and you can't defeat it\" I knew that that made her suffer much more than before.\"Tell it\" \"You're stronger than me…and I can't defeat you\" She choked. \"Good girl\" I said and I released her. She fell down. She touched her jaw. She was still aching. \"Get out of here\" I told her and she stood up. She looked at me like she was crazy. She grabbed my knife and she threw me on the floor. She was above me and she tried to stab me. But of course she failed. I reversed her. She was now under me. I was her commander as I always did. She tried to lift but I didn't let her. I did something that I wanted to do for a long time. I put my lips on hers. She tried to resist. But it was late. I tasted the salty taste of her hot tears as I touched her collarbone. She abruptly shoved me away, stood to her feet and opened the door, leaving without looking back. I lied on the floor with my head looking at the ceiling. Vincent got out of his room and saw me. \"What are you doing?\" He asked me hesitatingly. I lifted my head slightly. \"I was taking my dose\" I smiled and I pulled my head down at the floor.\" That was damn good \" That was my last thought. Carly's POV I was shocked. I wanted to cut my veins. God help me! I didn't have the strength to kill him. Maybe I should tell it to Nick. He could handle that. No, I didn't want to hurt Nick. Nick was my lovely brother. I wanted to kill Bo. I didn't care if I would become a killer. I just wanted to get him out of my life. What if I bought a gun? I would end with that. I got in my house and I went to sleep. I wore my nightdress and I fell on the bed. I closed my eyes. I didn't want to think or to feel anymore. I wanted to die. Nick's POV I opened my eyes. The clock read 7:00 am. I quickly woke up and I went to Carly's room. I approached her bed and I sat beside her. She was sleeping peacefully. I smiled at the sight of her and I gently stroked her hair. After a while she opened her eyes and she gave me a smile. \"Good morning baby girl\" I said to her with a warm smile. \"Good morning Nick\" She seemed so smooth and cool. Such a lovely girl. The girl she always was. \"How do you feel today?\" I asked her. \"Nice\" She told immediately. \"Good for you honey. I'm so happy for you. You know you were a little bit strange. I don't misunderstand you. With all that we've passed\" I ended. \"What have we passed?\" She asked me and I stayed astonished. \"The tragedy we've passed Carly. Don't you remember?\" My anxiety was growing. \"No, I don't understand what are you saying\" What was that now? She didn't remember a thing? She must be teasing me. No, she isn't teasing me. My little sister is getting worse and I don't do anything to protect her… COMMENTS ARE WELCOME[Chapter 13] CHAPTER 13-LOST IN THE DARK I decided to end this story in order to start writing another one. There will be a few chapters before the end. I changed the summary because I wanted to give another end that the one I thought first. I know it's not like the movie and the end is going to be gruesome. In this story Carly is the temptation and Bo is the one who must decide what is he going to do. He is not in love( but he could definitely be over time)with her but he would like to have her in his life as many did in the movie. Carly finds amnesia as a way to defy the pain her past caused her. But that will prove fatal. Anyway,I like the idea of these two as a couple even if this is sick. After all this is my first attempt to write and I 'll try to become better…Whew! Sorry for the big prologue! Carly's POV I was happy. That was a new day. I had just woken up and I saw Nick sitting by my side. I loved him so much. He was my beloved brother. I could definitely rely on him. But he was strange. He looked at me as if I were someone else, someone stranger. \"Nick, why are you looking at me like that?\" I wondered and I gave him a huge hug. He smelled nice and I could feel his heart beating faster than it usually did. As I released him his glance was desperate. I could tell that he was going to cry. \"Niiick…come ooon!\" I laughed trying to make him feel better.\" I love you Nick. I want you to know this\" I told him as I put my palm to his red cheek. He touched it not believing what I had just done. \"I love you too Carly\" He told letting my hand and got out of the room. I sighed and I touched my head on my knees hugging my legs…Thoughts were inside my head and I thought it was going to break. Thoughts that I could not explain. Nick's POV I was walking through the hall thinking about what happened before. That moment was painful. I watched my sister getting from bad to worse and I could do nothing. For a moment I thought she was kidding me. That she was just trying to make things better. Bad her picture was scary. I was trying to explain her attitude but I wasn't able to do this. It was hard. I had to talk to Paige and press her tell me the truth finally. I couldn't wait any longer. I had to protect her. I entered the kitchen and I saw Paige holding her baby. She seemed to be thoughtful. \"Can you please take the baby upstairs I wanna talk to you\" I almost ordered her. She gave me a deadly but at the same time disappointed glance. \"I don't\" \"Are you serious? You girls wanna make me crazy?\" I shouted and my loud voice almost woke her asleep baby girl. \"I'm gonna take her upstairs you upset her\" \"After that come right here again I told you I wanna talk to you and it's fucking serious!\" I was out of control. Carly who had been mean to me yesterday tread on air today and Paige went from patient and calm to angry and odd. Am I going to meet them my future wife in such a situation? No way, I thought. Vannie would be puzzled. I neglected her but she understood. I didn't like that but what could I do? I saw Paige coming. I nodded her to sit down and I questioned her. She actually knew what I was about to tell her. \"Well?\" She asked me angry. \"Well?\" I think I''m the one who should be angry here little miss!\" \"Nick I want to tell you that…\" \"First I''m gonna tell you something\" I interrupted her. \"Carly goes from bad to worse over time\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that you have to talk to me. Otherwise we'll all be in trouble\" \"Nick, I honestly don't understand, I saw Carly yesterday, what changed?\" \"I think she's got amnesia\" I rubbed my back of my head. \"What?\" She gave me a questioning and worrying look. \"Let me see her. Come on\" I did as she said. I didn't want to see her again at this situation but I tried. We walked through the hall when we left outside Carly's door. I hesitated but she held my arm. \"Hold on\" She told me and I deeply sighed asI opened the door without knocking. We got in and we saw Carly lying on her bed holding a book. \"Come in\" She said with a small and peaceful smile as she was inviting us. \"Hey sweety, you ok?\" Paige asked with a huge grin. I didn't take my eyes off of Carly. \"I'm fine\" She told and she showed us the book she was reading \"Romeo and Juliet. Ain't that a great story?\" Paige went near her and sat at the bed holding her arms. I followed her but I didn't sit. \"Please remind me who you are. I know I know you but I am just a little bit tired and I have a splitting headache right now. Paige looked at me anxious \"I 'm Paige, your best friend from school, and he is your twin brother Nick\" Carly looked at me with a sad look and her eyes ready to explode. I felt my body numb and my heart was about to break. \" I will remember you sometime… I promise\" She burst into tears and I quickly approached her. I held her face with my hands and I looked in her blue eyes ready to cry. \"Don't do this to me Carly. Please. I wanna take care of you but I don't know ehat happens!\" I shouted a little and Paige pulled me from my sleeve. \"Don't press her. I think we have to call a doctor… don't worry Nick. She is gonna be fine\" I wiped my hot tears from my face and I looked at my sick sister again. \"Why are you treating me like this. I 'm not sick. I'm just tired. Please would you leave me alone?\" She asked me and I didn't speak. I got up from the bed and I went to leave the room after Paige. \"Nick\" She called and I was surprised to find her behind me. \"I love you. You must be a great brother. Sorry I let you down\" I gave her a huge hug as I felt my eyes dropping, watering her blond hair. I let her free and I finally left the room. Carly's POV My head was gonna break, my body was on fire and I could do nothing to change it. I didn't remember anything. I didn't have bad situations in my head, my memory was off. I felt this was happening to take a break from difficulties. But I still hurt. I felt bad that I didn't remember beautiful moments with my twin, that I didn't remember my best friend. It was kinda strange. I wanted to bring back the memories but I couldn't. Suddenly my cell phone broke my thoughts. I took it and I looked at it. Unknown call. I didn't knew the number, not that I could be able to remember if it was a friend or a relative. But was it? I answered with a strange tone. \"Hello?\" \"Hi. It's me\" A heavy, manly voice was heard. \"Who are you? I asked not really knowing who it was. \"You already forgot me?\" \"Actually I've forgotten everything. I honestly don't recognize you\" \"Is this some kind of joke?\" The man asked angry. \"No. That's the truth I told I don't remember who you are so please tell me\" I told. \"I want you to come here\" \"Where?\" I didn't understand anything. Was this man crazy or something? \"Don't play with me Car, I am not kidding\" \"So tell me where I am supposed to come\" \"Ok. Write\" He murmured an address and I wrote it down to my docket. \"Ok. I'll come. But I have to escape from my brother. He is not gonna let me come\" \"What's wrong with you. You really don't remember anything?\" He was heard quite pleased. \"I already told you that\" I told him again. \"I have to hang up ok. Let me get ready\". I told and I flied my cell on the bed. I got up and I stepped into the shower. The water was cold but I didn't care. I needed it. When I was done I dressed up. I didn't know what I had to wear because I didn't know where I was going. Did I have to wear something fancy and alluring or simply something everyday and cozy?I finally decided what to wear. My choice was a strapless black dress, not too short, with match shoes and bolero. I looked my reflection at the mirror and I focused at my eyes. They were a bit red. I fixed my make up, I took my purse and I thought that living from the front door would be trouble. Then, I looked at the windows. Hopefully the house was low. I opened it and I got out trying to be as much quiet as I could. I didn't knew if this was right or wrong, but I wanted to find out who this man was. And I would.[Chapter 14] CHAPTER 14 – BRAINWASHING Hey guys here is chapter 14. There will be 2 more. I know this is such a crazy story but…I am going to end it. Ohh….and sorry for any possible mistakes!This will be all in BO's POV. Bo's POV I sat at the edge of my bed and I thought the things she had said to me. Was she insane? Maybe she was playing with me. No, if she was just playing with me she would be afraid to come here. She had forgotten about anything? How is that possible? When I was only a kid I had once flipped quickly through dad's medical books. Only once because I was not interested in this shit at all. I had read about amnesia and such but…was that possible? She chose to forget. Not too quickly. Not too easy. I got her now. She was in my hands. A knock on the door broke my tortuously thoughts. \"Bo, I get it?\" Lester asked me getting in the room in a hurry. \"No, just get out of here before she comes and tell Vincent not to appear. I wanna stay alone with her. Just the two of us. Now get. Get!\" I ordered him and he obeyed. After a while I was alone. Vincent was in his own room as long as he couldn't leave the house because of his damn face. But he wouldn't disturb me. He never did. I went in the living room after I had gone to the kitchen to grub some beer. I opened it and I went to sat on the couch. I looked at the clock. 10:30. Where had she been. It'd been half an hour. As I was waiting I took a large gulp of my beer for about three times. After ten minutes I heard the bell ring. There she is I thought. I hurried to open the door but I held for a moment. I looked from the peephole. She wasn't hold a gun or something. After that I opened the door. What I was facing was just amazing. Damn her for being so pretty. The same as the first time she came in Ambrose. I looked her from top to bottom. She was beautiful. \"Hi\" She told with a small smile. So this was true. She didn't remember a thing. Otherwise there was not possibility to smile to me. \"Hi babe\" I immediately understood that she had felt embarrassment hearing me call her like that. I like that. \"May I get in?\" She hesitatingly asked. \"Of course\" I answered and I closed the door after she got in. \"Do you want a drink?\" I asked to make her feel comfortable. \"Who are you?\" \"Everything on time\" I told her wanting to extend her agony. \"I don't have time. I wanna know. Just tell me damn it\" I got a serious glance to show her I was annoyed. I moved closer to her and she went one step back, but I caught up with her. I touched her face and make her look at my eyes. She was nervous, I could feel it. I could feel her heart beating and beating increasingly louder. \"Why are you so damn stubborn?\" I asked smiling a bit and smelling her blond, curly hair that smoothly brushed her shoulders. \"Because I don't know anything about you. I think I'm scared. This place is freaking me out and…so does your presence. \"Relax. Don't be afraid of me\" \"But…\" \"Shhhh… I interrupted her. I knew I hated her and I had to be angry but having her in my arms and smelling her essence kinda turned me on. \"You are something like a boyfriend to me?\" She insisted. But I decided to give in to passion that night. \"Later…\" I told her and I kissed her lips. She gave in ,too. That time she kissed me without pressing her. Despite her concerns she seemed to enjoy it as I did. Because I did. I wanted her at least once. After finishing with her lips I kissed her neck slowly. She was holding my neck condescendingly. That time I was caring about nothing but what was happening in that room. I took off her jacket and kissed her shoulders. I took off my black shirt and I threw it away. Then I unclasped her black dress and it slipped touching the floor. I got her in my hug and I led her into my bedroom… The next morning I woke up and I felt a warm body touching mine. I turned my head and I saw her sleeping naked next to me. She had her back turned so I kissed it a few times softly trying not to wake her up but in vain. \"Morning\" She told turning towards me with a sweet smile. \"Good morning my love\" I said kissing her lips. She didn't resist. On the contrary she approved. \"So mister mysterious will you tell me something about you…and me?\" \"Didn't you understand from yesterday?\" I asked her and she blushed a bit. \"So you are my boyfriend…and do you know my brother?\" I irritated hearing about that bastard but I finally smiled at her not wanting her to understand. \"Very well. We are best friends\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah\" I told her petting her neck. \"But…\" \"What?\" She asked me worried. \"Because your brother, Nick, he is a bad guy\" \"What do you mean?\" She withdrew herself a little away from me. \"I mean that, he is a bad boy… he drinks a lot, his companies are really bad and…\"I stopped a little. \"And?...\" \"And he was always trying to make you seem the bad twin. To your parents, to your friends, to everyone. He wanted to bury your good image in order not to seem irresponsible and bum\" \"Are you serious?\" She said ready to burst into tears. \"Of course baby, why would I lie to you?\" I ensured her and kissed her forehead.\"We were really good friends but lately I've broken away with him because I didn't want to hobnob with a guy like him\" \"I don't believe it\" She said psychologically exhausted. \"What else?...tell me\" \"Are you sure baby. I don't want to upset you anymore\" I lied. My soul was laughing and my blood was boiling asking for revenge. \"Yes, Bo. Tell me. I wanna know\" \"Ok. He… he tried to kill you. Sometime when he was badly drunk. He hates you Carly\" I told her watching her collapse. \"Whh..at?\" \"I'm afraid that he will try again. I worry about you baby. I cannot live without you. We have to do something\" I was approaching my purpose. She roosted in my chest. \"What?\" \"I want to protect. If he continue to exist we will always be afraid of our lives\" \"You mean…\" \"That's the only way my love… I'm sorry…you have to do it. He tried to take your life…he doesn't deserve to live. This is the only way to live happy together\" \"But today…I saw him…he cried because he couldn't help me\" \"I know. But it's all lies\" \"Come here…\" I told her. She obeyed. \" I love you\" She told me. I felt rather strange. No one had told me that before. \"I'll do it If it's the only solution. Although I don't remember a think I feel I know you. I trust you\" \" That's my girl\" I said to her and I kissed her lips again. I wanted to make love to her again but I held. I got up and got dressed. She went into the bathroom to do the same. I sat on the bed and I rested my head on my hands. \"Naughty naughty girl. The game is finally mine…\"[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 –The plan Carly's POV I stepped in the shower, Bo's shower, and I let the water run all over my body. I brought in my mind the night he tendered me. He loved me. I was sure now. I believed him. If he tells that killing Nick is the only way to protect me, I will do it. I didn't believe that Nick was so evil and insidious. I didn't believe he tricked me like that. He was giving a great performance all that time. He said he wanted to see me well and healthy but… his words were all a lie… At least I had Bo. That man was so loving and aggressive at the same time. The way he kissed me last night… he was both adorable and sexy. I didn't know if what I was about to do was right but I couldn't let Nick destroy my life. Maybe Paige was in the plan… Oh my god I didn't know a thing…I had no idea about my past, about the bad situations Nick had given me. A knock on the door made me jump a bit. \"Carly, you ok?\" I heard Bo outside the bathroom door. \"I'm fine\" I answered. I stepped out the shower and I got dressed. I put on my yesterday clothing because I didn't have a change. I opened the door and I saw him waiting me lying on the bed. \"Come here\" he told me and I obeyed. He was so cute with a sexy glare releasing from his blue eyes that it was difficult to resist. I took a seat on the still unmade bed. \"What?\" I asked tentatively. He touched my face and kissed me. I felt my body shivering. He run his hands on my thigh and then he slowly placed his hand behind his back and into his black jeans. After a while he lifted his hand in front of me again showing me a gun and using it to touch my cheek and then my wet hair. \"What is this?\" I asked him. \"You know what this is\" \"Will I use it?\" \"Yeah. Except you prefer something else. But I think that's the easier way\" \"Ok. I got it. Are you sure this is the only way…\" \"I am\" He told without even letting me finish my sentence. \"Alright. Give it to me. I am ready\" I stood up and said to him determined. \"No! Are you crazy? It's only 11 am and it's too risky. You must wait until it starting getting dark\" \"Fine. And what am I supposed to do now?\" I asked him with a curious glare. \"If you come here right now I'll show you\" He smiled at me and I approached him. He went to kiss my lips but I interrupted him. \"Ahhh… Bo we forgot about Paige, my friend. She lives with us\" He looked at me troubled. \"And?...\" \"And what? You want me to kill Nick in front of her? She has a baby now in the house\" I noticed that he was a little bit confused. \"A baby?\" \"Yes. From Blake, her ex boyfriend. He disappeared when he learned about her pregnancy and she was broken. Then he regretted and he wanted her to forgive him. But she was adamant\" I explained. \"Really? That girl got pregnant from that guy?\" \"Yes, but what are we gonna do now? Nick is a scum and if she is there he will take her on his side\" I told gripping his hand. \"Don't worry, just call her and tell her meet you somewhere else in order to leave Nick alone\" He told me and I agreed. \"That's a good idea\" \"When you kill him you will come to me. I'll be waiting for you\" He added. \"Ok. What time?\" \"I think 11 pm it's ok\" \"Ok\" I told him again and I came closer to him – so close that I felt his hot breath on my face. \"Kiss me\" I asked. \" I need it\" He didn't waste any time. He grabbed me and forcefully kissed my lips. He lied on top of me and he started kissing my neck… Bo's POV She became mine again. I didn't expect her to be that courageous. She was ready to kill his brother. She would do anything I told her. I looked at my clock. 10:15. Damn it. I got up and shook her arm to wake her up. She looked at me and rubbed her eyes ''Bay get up you have to call that friend of yours\" I told her kissing her cheek. \"Ok\" She told me. After half an hour she was ready. She had called her friend and she told her to meet her at a bar for some reason. She also ensured her that Nick was gonna stay at home tonight. That was perfect. Everything was going on very well. The revenge was nearing. I let her get ready and I left the room. I went to drink some water and I saw Vincent sitting on the table fixing his wax mask. \"What the hell are you doing in here? How can you be so stupid? What's the matter with you! She is in the room god-damned freak! She could see you here\" I shouted at him. He didn't answer and he went to leave. \"Wait. We leave now. I persuaded her to kill that jerk Nick. I'll finish with her too and then we can go back at Ambrose to start from the beginning if the cops have forgotten about our case. You'll start sculpturing again\" He nodded and left. After a minute she got out my room. \"I'm ready\" She told me. \"Let's go\" I said and I grabbed my keys from the coffee table. We left the the house and we got down the stairs. Once we got out the building we walked into my car. We looked at each other one last time. \"You ready?\" I asked her. \"I am…\"[Chapter 16] THIS IS THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY STORY. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PLOT WAS AGREEABLE BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN READING THIS HERE IS THE END. I KNOW I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT PART BUT I DO NOT OWN HOUSE OF WAX…I WISH I …AND SORRY FOR SOME STUPID GRAMMAR ERRORS…OOHHHH AND THANKS FOR THE REVIEWS! Chapter 16 – The revenge NICK'S POV I sat on the soft couch and I explored the ceiling. I stared at its pure, white color for a few minutes and I rubbed my head. I thought about my sister for a while and I felt such a trashy man and brother that I could not help her. Paige told me, before she left, that Carly was not at home and she wanted to talk to her. How the hell did she leave the house without telling it to me in that miserable situation? She left for a whole night and I didn't realize it. How can I be so stupid? I grabbed the TV control and I turned that thing on in order to relax and forget about the things had happened. I would go with Paige but she told me that Carly wanted to talk to her in private. I was so curious to know about what those two was about to talk. Carly kept secrets. Secrets that probably she didn't want to share with me. I could not blame her after all. She was right. I have always been a prick to her since junior high… I would easily get into trouble anytime and I could blame her about all my shit… I was an immature boy…I was afraid to take things seriously…now I can see her point… I needed to grow up as she said. Television could not keep me busy from not thinking of my sister so I decided to turn it off. I went to the kitchen and I opened the fridge to grab a bottle of water. I looked at the clock and it read 10:30. I grabbed my cell phone from the table and I dialed a number. \"Hi baby\" \"Hi\" The young woman replied with a voice full of emotion. \" I missed you Nick\" \"I missed you too honey. How about coming to my house tonight, I'll be on my own. I want to see you. I have neglected you lately and I want to rectify\" I told her, my voice was a little bit hoarse. \"I 'd very happy to meet you tonight but, are you sure there will be no problem?\" \"Of course I am. Don't worry. My sister and her friend are not in the house and they will be late. I'm not feeling very well and I want to be with you tonight. Just the two of us\" I told her and to my pleasure the answer was \"yes\". \"Ok. I'll be right there. I send you a kiss\" She told me and I smiled to myself. She hung up and I went to change into some more relaxing clothes. I put on a black pair of shorts and a blue-black T-shirt. I went in the living room again and I lit some small candles to make a cozier atmosphere. After that, I lay on the couch with my hands behind my head thinking about my miserable life. The only one who made me feel happy was Vanessa. I was going to make my life with her as soon as possible. …xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx Bo's POV We waited patiently in front of the boy's house. I sometimes felt that she was not going to do it, that she was going to quail. She was upset and as the time went by she became more and more pale. I touched her nearly stained from tears eyes and I wiped I small teardrop. I looked at her with a look of sympathy and she eyed me hopeless. She hesitatingly grabbed my hand. \"These marks\" She said and I looked at her annoyed. \"Are they still hurt?\" \"These marks…\" I started to talk but she interrupted me. \"I know they hurt… and I guess they are a gift from my brother. It is difficult to cause marks like them. It requires hatred and evilness\" \"Let's just stop talking about these fucking marks!\" I shouted pissed.\"You have a missing finger,too\" \"You are right\" she simply answered\" I'm getting used to this although I have no idea who did this to me\" I looked at her pretending that I didn't know a thing. \"Are you sure that that's the best idea? I mean to commit a murder? Is the situation that uncontrolled? Maybe some doctors could solve his problem\" She was so cold and unemotional that she surprised me. \"I'm so confused\" \"Carly…\" \"If you tell me that's the only way then it is. Just say it one last time. I want to be sure that what I am about to do is right. You are the only one that I trust\" I handed her the weapon and I enclosed it in her palm. I rubbed it softly for a while and then i kissed her lips poorly. \" That is the only way to get back your life. You can do it. You don't need anyone else but me. You are strong. Get out now. This will end very soon my darling. I promise\" She quickly obeyed and she went to open the door. I looked outside and I immediately grabbed her arm keep her in place. \"What the hell is she doing in here?\" I asked eyeing a blonde girl approaching Nick's house. He opened and she entered the house. \"I don't fucking know. She may be Nick's girlfriend . Vanessa I think\" \"She ruined everything. Let's just leave\" \"No. I will go. Maybe I can get rid of her too. Otherwise she will be a witness. We need to do it now. There will not be another chance. Leave now. When I'm done I will come to you\" I eyed her smiling. I could easily convert her from the good twin into a sadistic slave of mine. She left the car resolutely. \"That was much easier than I thought\". I started the engine and I started my way home. …xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Carly's Pov I was determined to end what Bo told me to end. There was no return. It was now or never. I took my keys from my pocket and I noiselessly opened the door. I walked inside and I watched my step not wanting a crack to change my plans. I continued entering the living room but I saw nobody expect lighted candles. As I watched insistently the candles memories floated my head. \" So why did you come? To piss me off?\" \" Don't you get it? You're the good twin. I'm the evil one.\" \" we were looking for Bo. He works at the gas station\" \" You found him\" \" How cool is this? Everything in here is wax. The floor, the walls\" \" Watch my finger . Watch my finger\" \" Oh, my God. He did this to you? I watched my missing finger. \" Carly, behind you! I swear to God, if you hurt her…Vincent!\" \" You're not a freak! He was! You don't need to do this. Please don't kill me!\" \" Nick, get up! We're almost there! Come on, Carly. Faster! \" You okay? We're okay\" \" Wade?\" \" Vincent?\" \" Bo?\" \" Nick?\" \"Nick!\" I shouted unconsciously and I looked at the gun. I stepped back and I leaned on the wall. \" Carly?\" He run to me from inside and he stopped when he watched the weapon. \"Stay back\" I told him and I pointed him with a gun with my hand shaking a bit. \"Carly…what are you doing hon…\" \"Don't you dare call me like that…you are such a liar\" I told him misty-eyed. \"What the hell happened to you my little sis?\" He said to me emotionally. \"I'm sorry my twin\" I told and I pulled the trigger. I heard a deafening noise. I opened my eyes and I saw Nick lying unconscious on the floor. \"NICK! Oh my god why did you let me to do this? Why didn't you cured me earlier? I have no reason to live now\" I shouted and I hugged him crying harder than ever. His blood on my hands was feeling warm and I cupped his wound with my palm. I could also hear Vanessa screaming in depth and she fell on the floor sick at heart. I gave a look at her and a last one at my wounded brother and I stand up grabbing my weapon and getting out of the house. With my mind clearer that ever I started running to that fucker's house. The rainy weather washed away my brother's blood and made me run faster than I had run in my whole life. \"Fucking bastard! You finally managed to separate us!\" I shouted not caring if anyone saw me although the dark road was empty and lifeless. I didn't know how I managed to get to his home but I eventually did. \"Open up!\" I shouted and I kicked his door. He immediately opened and I pushed him so hard that we both fell on the floor. \"You sick fuck!\" I yelled at him and I placed the gun to his throat. \"What the fuck happened to you baby?\" He taunted. \"I'm not your fucking baby asshole!\" \"Of course you are. I took what I wanted from you. And you didn't resist at all!\" \"Shut up!\" I said crying and thinking that I had let him totally touch me. In a flash he set me down roughly and he grabbed the weapon from my hand. \"No sweetie. You shut up!\" He said and he shot me. That was the last sound I heard. ….xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Nick's POV I opened my eyes and I faced a cold, dull and colorless hospital room. I turned my head and I saw Vanessa sitting by my side. \"Nick? My love…\" She told me and she gave me a kiss on my forehead. \"Where is Carly?\" I asked her but I could see the lifeless look on her pretty face.\"Where is my sister?\" I insisted and a tear fell on my cheek. \"They found her a bit farther from home\" \"No!\" I looked at the ceiling desperately . \"Is she dead?\" \"I'm sorry Nick\" \"Me ,too. God took my twin. The other half of me\" \"Nick you have me now. We will be always together\" \"Thank you\" I said and she gave me her sweetest hug. I didn't know what had happened and I would never understand. Why she hurt me, why she hurt herself. She took my other half with her. But she would always be my little sister. ...xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx Bo's POV I laid on the large bed of an old and miserable motel. I looked at the brunette who was next to me and I smiled at her. I was so pleased that I managed to give those kids a good lesson. Now my life was like old times. Sin and murder. The only way to take back my lost childhood and get rid of my pain and the god-damned memories. I wanted to take more lives, to kill more, to murder more. Just for fun. I got so drunk last night that I barely knew how the hell that girl had ended up with me in that bed. It was a pretty little thing but I didn't even know her name. She touched my injured wrist and caressed it. She gave me a weak smile and she asked me with a worried look something that I expected. \"Baby where did you get injured?\" I rolled my eyes a bit not wanting to make her feel bad. At least not at that moment. \"Don't worry babe. Just a small accident\" I told her. It was not small at all and it lasted almost my half life. But she was not supposed to know. Nobody was supposed to know. I reach out and I placed my cold body over her warm one. I was twice as her so she could not move. She only stared at me with a mix of worry and satisfaction. Her skin was so soft. I touched her shiny hair and then her full lips. I closed my eyes tiredly and dizzily for a second and I opened them again. Her shape had changed. Her brunette hair had turned into reddish I could say curls and her lips had changed into heart shaped. I had never seen lips so shapely like that. The beautiful woman looked at me with a sweet and passionate look and touched my face. I jumped slightly. I felt my body numb and my voice became a bit hoarse… \"Carly?\" …..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx Two years later Nick married Vanessa and they had a baby girl. He never forgot about his sister. Paige also lived with them. Bo didn't left Carly's corpse in his temporary home. He moved her and he left beside her another weapon with only her fingerprints. He cleaned the house from evidence and he and his brothers returned to Ambrose. Vincent started sculpting again. Bo never learned that Nick survived. THE END ","Summary":" House of wax Sharp Dilemma Chapter 1 – We are in trouble I do not own anything except my story line"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Streets of Gold","Author":"WhiteLight12","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13174525","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The city that never sleeps. New York City. The city that I call home ever since I was just a puppy. Very few things had haunted me at such a young age. I do remember being left in the cold, rainy night by my mother. She didn't want to raise me and I never understood why. What did I do wrong? I'm only half German Shepherd and… my other half was her but I don't know what that is and my left flopped ear doesn't make any difference to me. I would hide out under rusted garbage bins considering it was the only thing my small body could fit under. I whimpered sadly in hopes of getting through to anyone within earshot of me. My body shook and shook from how cold it was that night. All I could do was close my eyes and await death but… I soon realized that my cries were heard. I was then rescued by a kind hearted human who took me out of the frigid rain and back to his place in a worn old boat at the bottom of the bay with other dogs, who immediately took me in, gave me a blue bandana, and gave me my name. Plus, those dogs have become not only my dear and close friends but they're my family. First we got Dodger, he's the leader of our gang and quite the wise cracker. He's got a cool attitude and knows the streets just as well as the rest of us. He's like a brother to me and I don't mind pumbling him every now and again. Next is Rita, she is my current best friend. She is a tough yet sweet natured. I love spending time with her and she's like a mother to me. Next is Tito, the smallest of the gang. He's quite the hot head and he's a bit of a hopeless romantic. He often annoys us with his annoying choice of music that he often dances to. But underneath that, he's actually very good hearted. Next we have Francis, the sophisticated one of our gang. He mostly spends his time watching the old tv that we have in our old boat house watching his daily dramas. Kind of an overachiever if put nicely. Next is Einstein, not exactly the smartest tool in the shed but he's a good guy. Rather protective towards us, and the biggest dog out of all of us. With me being the third tallest yet second strongest because of me being half german shepherd. And last but not least is our caretaker, Fagin, a.k.a the human who found me when I was a pup. Sure, he's a clumsy and skewed fellow, but he's lovable and cares for each of us equally. He's also in some trouble with a sadistic and villainous man he calls Sykes. And last but not least is Sykes' personal lap dogs, Roscoe and Desoto. I can't stand those two mongrels because of their vicious, mean spirited attitude and disgustingly intelligence to add into the mix. They even try to hit on both Rita and I and it's always disgusted both of us. But considering they work for that brute, they're not easy to manipulate. And myself, Rose, a German Shepherd half breed who loves living in the city with my friends and being a happy as can be. I'm also protective of my friends when they need to be defended. And if only what we had in store for us when a new member joins our gang. And it's not a dog either.[Chapter 2] The air in the houseboat seemed muggy this evening, which makes me sleepy every time the 7 of us bunk down here for the even and out of the prying eyes of the humans of New York. The only ones gone where Dodger and Fagin. The rest of us decided to stay back home to just wait them out. Hopefully they'll come back with some food because I can't be the only one who's hungry around here! I slept soundly on my old bean bag chair with my dog forelegs crossed in front of me with my head on top of them. Both of my ears were laid back slightly. My fluffy tail was on my right side because my hind legs were on my right side. I had my eyes shut and tried to sleep and tuned out the annoying music that Tito enjoys so much. A part of me wants to pick that up with my teeth and throw it in the bay. He contradicts that it's not irritating in the slightest but boy is he dang wrong! I tilt my head to the right a little bit and open my right eye to see Tito dancing his way towards the loot box that has the stuff we brought in. Me personally, brought in a old book in hopes that could change things with that brute Sykes. From what I've heard from those dastardly doberman's, he wanted something that's worth his while and I hope that book helps. He just wants his cold hard green cash or something like that. \"Tito! Stop that racket! I'm trying to watch this show!\" Francis scolded in an annoyed tone. I rolled my eyes and moved my head to look away from him and I tried to sleep. When I realized it wasn't working, I just raise my head and let out a yawn and I smack my jaws together. Francis was, not surprisingly, watching something that I'm not familiar with and he was mimicking it as if he was apart of it. Then, Tito jumps in front of the tv, full on blocking his view. \"Hey Frankie, whatcha watching man? Does he get the girl? What happens man?\" Tito asked, still in Francis' way. \"Shut up, you little rodent.\" Francis scolds snobbishly. I shake my head along with my fur. Can't blame Tito for being curious. \"Well, to be honest Francis, it is pretty boring. And with you mimicking it, it's annoying. How about put some boxing because that's more entertaining.\" I chime in. The wrinkly dog glares at me but I don't falter. \"Ey, Rosie! She understands!\" Tito cheered, giving me a high five with our left forepaws. Francis tried slapping the little dog but was quick to avoid it. \"Ey, Frankie, Que Paso? You've gotten slow man!\" Tito teased, his tail wagging vigorously. Francis, being offended, put his forepaw on his chest. \"My name is Francis. Fran-cis. Not Frank. Not Frankie. Francis. Even Rose can get it precise.\" Francis corrected, getting me to roll my yellow brown eyes. \"No kidding man! So what did you bring in today, Frahn-cees?\" Tito said, imitating the motions Francis was making. \"It's none of your business! You intrusive little pipsqueak.\" Francis answered, being secretive. I ended up chuckling at what he said. \"No need to be secretive, Francis. If if makes you feel any better, I found an old book to hopefully appease you know who.\" I say, my floppy ear raised a bit. \"See? At least someone's being open about what they brought in.\" Tito said, once again giving me a high five with the same paw. Francis looked on in defeat. \"Look what I've got.\" Einstein said, walking up to us with a broken tennis racket. We all look up at him. My pointed ear was raised all the way and a smile appeared on my face. \"Oh good show Einstein. All we need is the net and court.\" Francis sarcastically says, rolling his eyes. I roll my eyes and stand in the bean bag and I get out of it. I stretch all four of my legs and shake my black and brown fur along with my floppy ear. \"You think this place is big enough?\" Einstein asked, taking it into consideration. Francis didn't mean what he said but I didn't want to ruin it for him. \"Hey, man, all we need is some good quality stuff. Check it out!\" Tito said, holding that torn wallet in his teeth again with a cheeky grin. \"Oh, shredded leather.\" Francis dissed Tito. \"Shredded wha-? What you talkin' about man? That's primo wallet man!\" Tito shouted, chucking the wallet to the floor. Francis just had his eyes closed and looked away from us. \"Rubbish you mean?\" Francis said. Tito then bared his teeth and jumped around angrily around Francis. \"Alright that does it man! You insulted my pride! That means death!\" he shouted, clearly offended. I just sit down and use my left hind leg to scratch my floppy ear because I didn't want to listen to this petty argument. \"Cut it out, you two. You know Rose doesn't like it when you two fight.\" Rita's voice broke the fight. I look over to her to see her give them. Well, she's not wrong because I don't like it when they argue. Rita walks over to the loot box and looks down into it. \"Fagin's not going to be happy about this. So Francis, you got the food right?\" she asked, pulling her head back a bit. Francis then cowers down a bit. \"Well… I…\" he stuttered. The four of us began to protest in annoyance. I stand up and put my right forepaw forward, lower my head with both ears forward and my german shepherd tail raised. \"Frankie! It was your turn to get our food today! Why do you slack off?\" I growl, getting irritated. The others agreed with me on that because Francis was supposed to get food today because I was getting hungry. \"Aw man! It's newspaper burritos again!\" Tito whined, shaking his head. \"Whoa whoa, cool it Dodger fans.\" the voice of Dodger made my head raise. He was leaning against the wall of the entrance with his forelegs crossed. He had a cool expression on his furry face. He had a link of hot dogs around his neck, covering his red bandana. \"Allow me to introduce you to… your dinner. Hot dogs a la carte.\" Dodger said, throwing the hotdogs to us. My furry tail wagged at seeing the delicious hot dogs. \"The dodge man strikes again!\" I say, excited to see not only food but him also. I sit next to Rita on her left side. \"You remain our preeminent benefactor.\" Francis said. \"So how'd you do this time, Dodge?\" Rita wondered. I lay down in front of the hotdogs and pick on up with my teeth and begin eating before Dodger started to explain how things went down with him. \"Let me tell you Rita. It was tough. Only I could've done it.\" Dodger says, sounding dramatic. \"Did you get into a fight? How many were there?!\" Tito mused, bouncing on Einstein's head, in between his small floppy ears. I chewed on my hotdog and it tasted so delicious in my mouth. \"Picture the city. Eighth and Broadway. The crowds hustling, the traffic roaring, the hotdogs are sizzling.\" Dodger stated, marching back and forth by us, proudly shaking his head back and fourth. \"I love a story with food in it!\" Einstein said, enthusiastically. I glance over at him with a raised brow. \"Story of my life.\" I say, shaking my head obviously. \"Enter Dodger, one bad puppy. Not just out for himself, but community minded. But he's not the only one out there. Enter the opposition.\" he continues, getting Rita and I to groan. What does he have up his fur this time? Then, he talks in a sinister tone. \"The greedy, ugly, psychotic monster…\" he started, coming out from behind an old plank baring his claws. \"With razor sharp claws, dripping fangs, and nine lives, all of them hungry. He comes at me, eyes burning. I knew my time had come. Suddenly-\" he explained exaggerated before something broke through the ceiling and into one of our blankets with a loud screech, sending all of us in a flying scared mess. \"It's the monster! Monster!\" I yelp loudly, quickly hiding behind that plank Dodger was, my tail between my legs and both ears laid back. Everything was chaotic for a moment before we look from our hiding spots. I raised my ears in curiosity. \"Well, what is it?\" Rita wondered. No one knew the answer to that of course. Tito bravely walked up to it while sniffing it. Then, a small paw reaches out and grabs Tito's nose with a tight grip. His fur stood on end while he screeched that it was an alien. But it was not an alien at all. Under that cover, was just a small orange cat. I automatically bare my teeth at the cat and begin to growl lowly, my hackles raised up. \"Cool it guys it's just a cat.\" Rita said, glaring down at the cat. I walk up to the cat, my teeth still bared and my eyes narrowed.\"iMi madre, un gato!\" Tito growled, his teeth bared too. We all surrounded the small cat, who seemed frightened by our introduction towards him. \"Explain yourself cat. How did you find this place?\" I growl, lowering my head. \"I… I followed this dog.\" he answered. I lifted my head and tilted it to left, because why would a cat do that since they'd usually run away from dogs like us. \"He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!\" Tito shouted, bouncing up and down before Rita kicked him back with her right hind paw. \"Shut up, Tito!\" she scolded. I kept looking at the cat with my eyes narrowed while my head was lowered and my ears forward. \"Why would a cat follow a dog?\" Francis asked. Einstein lowered his head and curled his lips. \"Yeah?\" he agreed. The cat was still cowered down because he believed we would kill him or something. \"I-I just wanted some of the sausages I helped him get.\" he answered timidly. When he said that, I raised my head again and my floppy ear went back some. \"He's a spy man! Let's eat 'im! You dead meat kitty!\" Tito declared. I got to thinking of what Dodger was saying because he was telling us about battling some monster with sharp claws and fangs. \"But I saw him come down!\" the cat said, looking around for Dodger. He then looked over at the armchair and told us to look over there. I raise my head and my left eye cocked when we see Dodger chilling on the armchair that Francis was sitting on earlier with sunglasses on his muzzle and over his eyes with baseball on the tv. \"Hey, kitty. What took you so long?\" he casually said. That's when I started to laugh at this because the 'monster' was a cat! I walk over to Dodger with a cheeky grin. The others laugh with me out of the ridiculousness of that situation. \"You, the almighty Dodger, getting help from a cat! I thought I'd never see the day!\" I laugh, going up to Dodger with my tail wagging some. \"Agreed, Rose! We thought he'd have razor sharp fangs and claws.\" Francis boasted. \"Hey, keep it down guys. The game's on.\" Dodger said, trying to avoid the conflict. Tito bounces on his nose and he knocked his sunglasses off. \"Just like the Rosie said, our top dog gets help from a cat!\" Tito chittered, jumping at the tv to turn it off. \"Okay, Rose and Tito, you two need to cool it.\" Dodger said, rolling his eyes. I bounded over to him with my fluffy tail wagging. \"He thinks he's so tough, huh? I'd like to see him try!\" I teased, bowing down in my play bow position and I began to wag my tail. \"I'm with Rosie on this one!\" Tito agreed. The little man actually agreed with me. \"Hey, Tito, Rose look!\" Dodger shouted, looking ahead of us. Once we look behind us, Dodger makes his break to jump on top of us. I play growl and we tumble against Francis; who join in. I play bit them as Einstein joins in. Then, Rita decides to join in the play fighting after I catch a glimpse of Tito getting tossed at her. I playfully bit on Dodger's leg but I was bitten on my tail. \"Hey knock it off! What's the matter with you guys?\" the voice of Fagin, our master, scolded. The five of us stop play fighting. I had Tito in my mouth due to the play fighting. The six of us look on at our master to see that he had an unopened box of dog treats in his hands. In pure excitement, we all charged towards him. I had my tongue hanging out as I ran to him. \"No, no, no!\" he said, holding his hand out in an attempt to stop us. But it was too late as we had already tackled him to the ground. I couldn't control my excitement and I had put both forepaws on his chest while licking his face repeatedly. My tail wagged vigorously and I whined happily. The others were doing the same thing as me and we all showed him love. \"No licking! Ha ha ha! What a joke! Settle down!\" Fagin exclaimed while chuckling. Suddenly, our whirlwind of love and affection had come to a halt by a few, loud honks that caused us to stop in our tracks. \"Sykes!\" Fagin exclaimed, gritting his teeth out of nervousness. We all backed down and got off of Fagin because we knew what had to be done. Both of my ears went flat and my head lowered. I backed off to where Rita was standing. \"Alright alright I'm coming! I'll be right there!\" Fagin exclaimed, crawling on the floor before going to the loot box. \"Okay, you guys! Don't let me down! What you got for me?\" Fagin said frantically as he picked up the wallet Tito had. \"It's worthless! What have you done? Oh how are we ever going to pay Sykes off with… a pussycat?\" Fagin questions, pulling the cat out of the loot box. Then, Sykes' dobermans, Roscoe and Desoto, bursted through the door loudly in low threatening growls. I went defensive and stood on my german shepherd paws. I lower my head and raise my ears. My floppy ear was in front of my head and my tail was raised to show dominance. I lower my head and stood in a defensive stance. Fagin approached them, only to have them heavily chomp at his hand. The mongrels made sure that Fagin was going to meet the brute. They then turn towards us with their evil grins and they chuckle sadistically. Rita glanced over at me and I glanced back and we glanced at Dodger because we knew what we were getting ourselves into. The dobermans were now walking around the place with their heads held up high. \"You know, Rose and Rita, I can't figure out why you two would hang around a dump like this instead of living in uptown with a class act like myself.\" Roscoe said, bringing his flirty face towards the two of us. Disgusted, I backed away with both ears back a little. \"Not interested.\" I say, backing up. He's always perving on us female dogs and it sickens me and Rita. \"Isn't it dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in one sentence?\" Francis said. It took all my energy not to laugh at that. He gave Tito a high five because of what he said before Roscoe got in Francis' face with his teeth bared. \"Hey, you got something to say to me fatboy?\" Roscoe threateningly said. That made me mad and I growl towards Roscoe deeply. \"Leave him out of this Roscoe. He's just stating the facts.\" I say, still growling. The doberman turned his attention towards me. I just glared at him with my head lowered. For a moment, I believed he would try to flirt with me again but, he ended up tackling me to the ground to where I was on back and that he was on top of me, baring his teeth at me. \"You stay out of this, you half breed!\" he growled. Well, so much for trying to pick me up like he did not a few minutes ago. \"Oy, get off her okay?! Come at me! I'm not scared of you!\" Tito scowled, wanting to take on the dobermans. I was a bit hurt that he reminded me being a half breed but I didn't falter. He did so and walked away from me. I rolled over on my belly with my forelegs out in front of me. Rita came next to me and helped me to my paws. \"Are you okay, Rose?\" she asked softly. I shook my fur before answering. \"Yeah, Rita, I'm fine.\" I answer, reassuring her. The doberman stood in the middle of the room. \"Go ahead. Let him go.\" Roscoe chuckled. Einstein was holding Tito by his tail while the chihuahua was trying to make an escape. \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size? And I don't mean Rose.\" Einstein said. Roscoe got in his face with his nose pressed against his and his teeth bared. \"Like you, old man?!\" Roscoe threatened. Dodger then decided to rope the hectic conversation and he marched forward towards the hostile doberman. \"Hey, Roscoe. Roscoe. Is this us losing our sense of humor?\" he said with ease. \"Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humor!\" Roscoe said before using his hind paws to kick our tv with one hard kick, causing a loud electric crash at the wall. \"See? I find that funny.\" he said, chuckling. So he decides to break our tv to show himself off for his sense of humor? That's not cool man. Not cool. Suddenly, that same horn blared loudly getting the attention of Roscoe. \"Hey Roscoe! Look what I found!\" Desoto called, pulling on an old newspaper with the cat on it. My hackles rose on end when that mutt found him because they would hurt him. \"Forget it Desoto. We got to go.\" Roscoe said, beginning to walk out of the door. \"I like cat's. I like to eat them!\" Desoto growled, getting closer to where the cat was before he suddenly jerks back with a pained growl. He ended up knocked over all the stuff that the cat was hiding behind. Roscoe rushed to his aid before the start to corner the cat in loud growls. Growling defensively, Dodger stood protectively in front of him. \"Get out of my way, Dodger!\" Roscoe growled. \"That's enough, Roscoe.\" Dodger said firmly. Then, the rest of us joined him. I stood beside Dodger with my head lowered and my teeth were bared at them with both ears raised, my floppy ear in front of me. They weren't going to touch this cat. \"Run along Roscoe. You're master's calling.\" Rita said lowly, smirking at him. The doberman's raised their heads at that. \"Unless you two want your butts kicked, I highly suggest you go to your master like the little lap dogs you are.\" I growl, my eyes narrowed. The doberman's than turn around to head out. \"We ain't finished Dodger. You guys are going to pay for this. Starting with that cat.\" Roscoe stated, getting me to growl even more. But once they were out of sight, I calmed myself down. \"Oh yeah! You guys don't scare me! Come back and say that to my face!\" Tito shouted, going up a couple of steps. It wasn't the first time he's tried to challenge them. Once they were gone, he trotted down the steps with his head held up high. \"Yeah those creeps will think twice before hassling us man!\" Tito said, chuckling proudly. Dodger sat down in front of the cat with a grin on the on his shaggy furred face. \"All right kid. What'd I tell you guys? Ol' Dodge can really pick them.\" Dodger said smugly. I just shook my black and brown fur, my floppy ear flopping around. Just then, the sound of the door opening caught our attention. Turning my head towards the door, it was Fagin soaking wet from head to toe. He looked so depressed… This worried me and my head and ears lowered out of concern. \"Three days…\" he whispered, stripping himself of his sopping wet trench coat onto the floor. He went to sit on the armchair and he lazily got his shoes off his feet. I look over at the gang, who too were concerned and worried for him. \"How am I ever going to come up with all that money?\" he said in a whimper. The six of us walked up to him and decided to help him through his sorrow. I went over to my old bean bag chair and picked up a pillow from there to help him relax his head. I held it firmly with my teeth with both of my ears laid back and my fluffy tail laid limpy behind me. When I brought it over, he leaned forward and I put it behind his head. But I didn't get down from standing on my hind legs. I lay my head on my forepaws while I looked up at him sadly. \"What's the use? I'll never get out from under that maniac.\" he sighed sadly. My german shepherd ears were completely laid back. \"My days are limited… and the number is three. It's hopeless.\" he continued to sulk, Rita and Dodger pulling a blanket that she brought over. Einstein then puts one of the dog treats that Fagin brought in for him to eat. I just look at him with a sad look. When he finished it, he looks at all of us with slightly wide eyes. He then swallows before he grins at us. \"Thanks guys…\" he said, getting my german shepherd ears to perk up, my floppy ear resting on my forehead. I lifted my head and happily pant with my tongue hanging out. Einstein then licks him on the face countless times out of affection. \"That reminds me! I saw Desoto's nose. Who did that?\" Fagin laughed, looking at who gave Desoto scratch marks on his nose. Dodger then held the cat with his teeth and let Fagin hold him. \"You? You?\" he said, chuckling lightly. \"That took a lot of guts. We've never had a cat in the gang before. And to think Rose here would be our last member.\" Fagin said, getting my fluffy tail to wag. He then reaches over to pet me in between my ears, and I nuzzled my head in his hand. He's not wrong because I was only a puppy when he found me and four years later, I'm happy with him and the others. Fagin then sets the cat on his lap to stretch. He then sighs and leans down in the chair. \"Alright. Time for bed. We've got a big day tomorrow.\" Fagin said. I get down off the chair to go back to my bean bag chair. When I jumped up on it, I twirled myself around and pawed on the chair to make it more comfortable. I laid down with my forelegs crossed and my head down on them. My hind legs were on my right side along with my tail curled around me. I then close my eyes as Fagin started to read our favorite book because Einstein begged him to do it. A smile appears on my face because I had always enjoyed hearing him read this book to help us sleep. My head tilts to the right a little bit as I find myself finally falling asleep after that hectic event earlier. It wore me out and we all need as much rest as possible because we all know what we were getting ourselves into. I can tell them one thing, teaching our new friend how to live in the streets should be a piece of cake. And I'm excited for that.[Chapter 3] Morning had arrived just as fast as the night. We were going to do our mission of helping Fagin with his debt with that brute. Since we have two days to get it all together, we can't mess around. We were now out of the houseboat and into Fagin's scooter. The basket was just big enough for all of us to fit in. I was towards the back with both forepaws hanging over the basket as we all rode bumply rode down the busy, crowded roads of New York City. The sun was warming not only the city but on our fur as well. I always loved the sun because of how much it warmed my fur. But I don't like the rain at all because of what happened in my past that I'd rather not discuss. But that's not important now. I turned my head and watched as Fagin was driving through the crowd of cars. Rita was next to me with Dodger in the front of all of us. \"This is the big one! We've got two days to do or die!\" Fagin exclaimed, seeming determined to get this done. He then looks back at Dodger, telling him to show him the ropes about how we do things just to survive on the streets. We then take a sharp turn while Fagin was still talking to us. I partly heard what he said. We then crash on concrete floor in an alleyway. \"Dead men don't buy dog food! So big smiles and get out there… and fetch!\" Fagin exclaimed, tilting the basket over a bit so that we could jump out. I land on the concrete with my forepaws first then my hind paws landed after. Fagin then leaves us in the dust as he rode off to get some money. I ended up shaking my black and brown fur and I stretched my limbs. \"Okay, if Sykes doesn't get some cold hard cash soon, we are doberman chow.\" Dodger said, leading us out to Columbus Avenue. \"Yeah, we should start in Columbus Avenue. We might find something worth his while.\" I say, trotting up to where Dodger was. \"What kind of work do we do anyway?\" the cat asked, taking interest of what we were going to do. As I walked, my fluffy tail was swaying back and forth and head was raised all the way along with my ears. \"Investment banking, man.\" Tito answered as he grabbed an apple with his teeth from a stand and threw it to Francis, who ate it instantly. \"Didn't you read about us in the Wall Street Journal?\" Tito continued. \"Really?\" the cat asked, clearly excited. \"Yes. Captains of Industry.\" Francis said. \"Wow, can I be one too?\" the cat asked. I raised my tail with my muzzle pointed up high. \"Hey, when you got your pals, you've got all you need.\" Dodger stated, looking back at him. He isn't wrong because I love being with my friends. \"We got to clean you up child and give you some on-the-job training.\" Rita said to the cat in an energetic tone. \"Yeah, kid, stick with us and you'll know this city like the back of your paw.\" I say, turning my head to look at him, starting to march proudly. We then begin to teach our newest member about living out here. From finding food and how not learning won't put food in your stomach. Once you use your head and use the talent you're born with, you'll feel right at home on the street. These are the Streets of Gold and you'll learn to love it once you learn how to survive. An unfamiliar street dog that looked mangy started chasing the cat. But I bared my teeth and growled deeply at the dog and the others joined me so our growls were mixed. The street dog saw how scary we were and ran off with his tail between his legs. You don't mess with a pack of dogs like that because we defend our own. The cat then began to yap like us dogs. We all laughed at what he was doing before we ran the other direction before suddenly stopping at the end of the alleyway so that we faced the street. \"Hello. What have we here?\" Dodger said, seeing one of those long cars taking a right turn. \"Alright! A chauffeur shuffle!\" Tito shouted excitedly. I look at the car for a moment before turning to face Dodger. \"Alright, Dodger, what's your plan?\" I ask. We all faced each other so that we were in a circle. \"I've got the perfect plan, Rose. Listen up everyone. Einstein, gimme a fender bender at two lights.\" Dodger started and Einstein agreed. \"Tito, you're in charge of electronics.\" Dodger said, getting the chihuahua to bounce up and down. \"Rose, you follow them and make sure everything goes okay.\" Dodger said to me. I wag my tail and nod because I was good of being sneaky and having keen eyes and ears. \"On it.\" I agreed. \"Rita and I will work the crowd. Francis?\" Dodger said, turning his head towards Francis. \"I know. My public awaits.\" Francis said, putting his forepaw on his chest and he arched his back. \"What about me? What do I do?\" the cat asked, looking up at Dodger. He told him to go with us. That's our best bet. \"Alright gato! Uncle Tito and Aunt Rosie will teach you how it's done!\" Tito said happily. Soon enough, we all split off to do our jobs. Tito and the cat swifty jumped on the back bumper of the limo. I ran to them and use my hindpaws to jump over them and onto the top of the limo without their knowledge. I sat down on the roof and let my tail lay limply behind me as we waited for Einstein to run into the limo. For now I just enjoyed the free ride and hope no human noticed that a dog is sitting on the top of a limo. Granted, I've done this before and didn't feel any regrets of doing it. Dodger was the one who taught me to do this when I was still a very young puppy. Being 4 years old and all grown up, I use this technique frequently. Then, I see Einstein come running out from an alley and he deliberately hit the front of the limo with a hard hit to the head. The limo suddenly stopped with a screech, causing me to slide forward a bit. I was able to catch myself and stand up on all four paws before turning and jumping off the car so I could meet Tito and the cat so that I was out of sight from the human driving this limo because they would surely indeed check to see what hit them. When I got back on the ground, I could hear the human driving get out of the car complaining about hitting something. Once he got out of the limo, the three of us went around to the drivers side because he left the door open. Tito and the cat jumped in and I stood by the door and behind the door so that I could keep an eye on them. Knowing Tito, there's a possible chance that he could mess this up so it's a good thing that Dodger sent me to hold an eye on them. All of my german shepherd paws were pressed firmly on the warm concrete road. \"Hey check it out man!\" Tito chuckled, fascinated with the interior of the limo. \"Hey, Rose, forget Fagin man! Let's take this baby to Atlantic City!\" Tito chuckled, playfully turning the wheel. I shake my head before looking around with my ears bouncing around on my head. \"As flattering as that sounds Tito, we need to focus. Get workin' on the wires.\" I say, not playing around. Tito rolled his eyes before he went under the steering wheel to deal with the wires. As he began, the cat jumped on the dashboard. \"Hey, Rose, Tito, what do I do?\" the cat asked, wanting to participate. \"How about being the look out? Yeah be the lookout.\" Tito said. The cat was confused about what that term is. \"What is that exactly?\" he asked, tilting his head a bit. I looked up at him and smiled at him. \"Just look out the window and let us know if the driver comes back.\" I tell him. Suddenly, a strange sound hits me in my ears, causing my ears to twitch. \"Hey! Hey, Tito, Rose! There's something back there.\" the cat warned us, lowering his head to whisper to us. I backed up a bit before saying, \"Tito, hurry it up!\" \"Hey, stop hassling me okay? I only got one more wire!\" Tito grunted with irritance as he tugged another wire. Just then, the cat tried getting to a lower level but he accidently stepped on the ignition, electrocuting Tito. He screamed from the shock and the car began to go absolutely crazy. The sound alone scared the life out of me and I winded up running the other direction, leaving the cat and Tito behind because I kind of knew they'd make it out of there. Hopefully, he'd get the cat out of there before anyone could spot him. I kept running with my ears laid back because of how much that sound scared me because I always had sensitive hearing. \"Let's get out of here!\" Dodger exclaimed, leading the pack once again. We all hid behind boxes behind the alleyway. There was now quite the uproar in the street because of that accident. I lower my German Shepherd dog head and pant with my head lowered and my tongue hanging out. \"Where's the kid? Rose, Tito, where is he?\" Dodger asked, making me feel guilty because I just left them. Tito coughed and was all black and his fur was singed from being electrocuted. \"He must still be in the car man!\" Tito said. We all looked around the corner to see that limo drive off with the cat in it. \"Oh that poor kid.\" Rita said in worry. \"You two were supposed to keep an eye on him!\" Dodger scolded, narrowing his eyes. His slightly floppy ears were pointed forward. \"Yeah well, it's hard to watch anything when you're getting barbequed man! And Rose has sensitive ears man!\" Tito said through coughs. \"Yeah, so how're we going to get him back?\" I say, lifting my head. I did feel slightly guilty about just leaving them like that since they were under my supervision but that noise was too loud for my ears to handle and I had to get away from it. \"Okay, Rose, Tito. You guys come with me. The rest of you get back to Fagin.\" Dodger said. I knew he meant that we'd follow them to see where they were going. The the three of us ran back into the street and we jumped on top of a taxi to follow it. I had my tail up and I looked ahead and my ears were forward, my floppy ear was hanging on my forehead. I was on Dodger's right side and Tito was on his left. We followed them up to what looked like a house that was way too rich for my blood. There was a little girl and that chubby old man who was overweight. The little girl was holding the cat as they went inside. The three of us was on the sidewalk and out of their sight. Tito even tried to pull one of his hot headed temperaments on those humans but Dodger had the good sense to grab him by his tail to hold him back. Now that we know that where the kid is so we can get him out of there. We went back to where Francis, Rita, and Einstein were. They were at a pawn shop where Fagin was in an attempt to get some money. When they saw us, they looked at us. \"Where's the kid?\" Rita asked us. \"We tailed him all the way at the Park.\" Dodger answered, nudging his head from the way we came. \"We never had a chance.\" I say, lowering my head and shaking it a bit. \"You should see this place, man! There's got to be maybe… two hundred people living there man!\" Tito informed them. \"You guys, we can't let him take the heat for us.\" Rita mentioned, thinking clearly. \"Yeah, if we don't get him out of there soon, who knows what they'll do to him!\" I say, lifting my head and quickly looked back and forth. \"Well, what in Heaven's name are we waiting for?\" Francis said, seemingly antsy. \"But what about Fagin?\" Einstein wondered, looking at Fagin. \"Alas, our beleaguered benefactor bearing the brunt of our futile endeavours.\" Francis said, arching his back once again. Psh, wow that place would fit him just fine because I didn't understand what he meant by that. \"Gimme a break! Speak english Frankie!\" Tito shouted, getting in Francis's face. Francis was getting angrier by the minute because we know he doesn't like being called that. \"Francis. Francis. FRANCIS!\" the bulldog shouted, baring his teeth at Tito. Dodger got in between them before a fight ensued. \"Cool it!\" he said, looking at the both of them. \"Okay. You two need to focus what we need to do. First, we need to spring the kid. Then we take care of the old man. Okay? Fighting right now isn't going to solve anything.\" I say, getting irritated at the two of them. \"Good plan, Rose.\" Rita said to me. \"Yeah man! He's family! He's blood!\" Tito said, clenching his paw like a fist. And with that, we started to construct a plan on how to get him back. We would do it in a couple of days because it was starting to get dark. \"Okay, you guys go back home and get some rest. I'm going to find us food to help us.\" I suggested. \"That's a good idea. We'll meet you back home.\" Dodger agreed. And with that, I turned around to find us something to eat. I should've known not to go alone. I should've had one of them go with me.[Chapter 4] Our plan was going to be full proof because we needed to get our member back. But since it's getting dark, we decided to bunk down for the night. But I was still out trying to get food for us. Everyone had gone back to the houseboat to wait for me. The usual place that I get our food is by the bay because most humans dispose of their food in that area. It relatively quiet but I was on the lookout for anything suspicious. Besides, it was my turn to find us something to eat anyway. I trotted along the old concrete of the bay and I kept my german shepherd nose to the ground to sniff around the area. When I finally found something, it satisfied me because it looked suitable enough for us to eat. But before I could get my teeth around it to pick it up, the sound of menacing growling caused me to freeze up as well as the chuckling of an evil man. When I slowly turned around, it was that Sykes guy with Roscoe and Desoto. They were in a fighting position with their teeth bared. \"So, you're one of Fagin's mutts? Heh heh, that's fine. When he finds out what I've done to his mutt, he'll pay me even faster.\" Sykes said sinisterly. I bare my teeth and let out a growl to show that I wasn't backing down from his threat. The doberman's were ready to fight me one Sykes's signal. The dobermans started surrounding me in menacing growls. I began to back up with my head lowered and my teeth bared. \"We'll go easy on you, you half breed.\" Roscoe chuckled evilly. \"Yeah, so don't move around too much.\" Desoto said. Just then, the man snaps his fingers. Before I knew it, I could feel their strong teeth in my fur and skin. I growl loudly and deliver some blows myself to their necks. The use their heads to push me over and they ended up biting me more than once and I yelped loudly from the pain of their bites. As much as I tried to fight back, they pressure of their blows and bites were too much for me to bear. One of them grabbed ahold of my back fur and skin and they threw me against a couple of trash cans with a loud crash. The dobermans weren't finished with me though… They grabbed me by my forelegs and they instantly threw me aside with a couple of rolls. The more they attacked me, the more hurt I was getting. I wanted one of the guys to help me. I was feeling helpless at this point. I can't take on two dobermans by myself… All I could feel was their teeth piercing my skin and their devastating blows. When I tried fighting back, they only came at me twice as strong. Then, Sykes snapped his fingers once again to signal the dobermans to stop attacking me. The last thing they did was throw me on the bay and I let out a pained whine. My eyes were shut tightly and I bared my teeth from the pain those dobermans put on me. I pulled my german shepherd paws up to me from the pain and I whined quietly from the inflicted bites from the dobermans, who walked away from me chuckling at my suffering and they left me there to let me wallow in my pain. Every part of my body was hurting me so much. Those dogs hurt me so much by their master's demand. Did they do this because of me being half german shepherd or was this another attempt to make Fagin pay him faster? This is just cruel… With heavy breaths, I used what strength my body had and used it to push it to my german shepherd paws and groaned from how much the teeth marks were hurting me. My legs were hurting greatly and I bared my fangs from the pain and my ears were laying limply on my head. I think some of my fur was ripped out of my body as well. I had both my head lowered along with my fluffy tail to where it wasn't moving as much. But the pain in my body was too much for me to bear and I stopped walking. Just then, my weight gave out on me and I fell to my right side. My head was stretched out and my vision I hadn't realized that I had passed out from how much pain I was in. I couldn't get up to make it back to the gang. When I was beginning to wake up, I found that I was laying on my bean bag chair. I didn't hear nothing at first but then begin to hear the voices of the gang. \"Look, she's waking up!\" Einstein exclaimed. I open my eyes slowly to see that I was back in the houseboat surrounded by the gang, who had worried expressions on their faces. \"Rose, are you alright?\" Rita asked in a soft tone. Einstein used his large nose to help me up a little bit so that my forelegs were in front of me but I was slouched a little as I was still sore from those dobermans hurting me like they did. \"My whole body is sore.\" I said groaning from how sore I was. \"Who did this to you?! I will tell them limb from limb!\" Tito sneered, ready to attack the ones who attacked me. When trying to move, it hurt so much. \"It was those dastardly dobermans… They attacked me.\" I say through a groan. Everyone was taken aback by those words because they didn't expect this to happen. \"Those ruffians! They'll pay for this!\" Francis said, clearly mad about what those dobermans did this to me. \"Why did they do this? Surely they wouldn't have done it just for fun.\" Dodger questioned, looking at me with a tilted head and concerned eyes. \"They… they did this to me because they believe that it'll make Fagin pay him faster…\" I groan, laying my head in between my forelegs. Everyone was appalled by this because this is no way that Fagin would pay that man faster because of this. \"This is getting out of hand. They'll surely pay for this. But in the meantime, you should rest for now.\" Rita suggested, staying next to me. Both of my ears laid back all the way and I looked down because of sore and quite shaken up by being attacked those dobermans with no chance of fighting back. I did try to fight back but… they easily overpowered me despite me being half german shepherd. If it was only one of them then I would fight them but two, I didn't stand a chance… Rita, being the mother figure of my life, jumped up on the bean bag chair with me and she laid next to me. The others, despite being upset that one of their own getting hurt by Roscoe and Desoto, decided to stay with me instead of going to their confined areas. Needless to say, we didn't forget about the mission about getting the cat back from that house but I needed to go with them to get him and I'm not in the right shape to go anywhere. All I did was close my eyes and try to go back to sleep. Resting in my main priority right now. At least I have the next couple of days to rest and heal up. Those dobermans will pay for what they did to me.[Chapter 5] Those two days had passed since we lost the cat and me being attacked by Roscoe and Desoto. Fortunately for me, I was well enough to move. When morning had arrived, Rita and I were the first to wake up and I wasn't feeling as hurt anymore. I was still sore a little but not bad enough to keep me grounded. When I jumped down from my bean bag chair, I whined a little bit because of the soreness in my muscles. \"Rose, are you okay?\" Rita said, checking on me. I looked behind me to look at her. She had a worried look on her face like a mother dog would give to their pup. Ever since I was a pup, she has not only been my friend but the closest thing to a mother that I've ever gotten since my real mother didn't do her job. \"Yeah, Rita, I'm fine. Just sore a little is all.\" I say. My answer didn't seem to be convincing enough to her because she jumped off the chair and walked over to me. \"Rita, I'm okay. Honest.\" I say, my ears dropping a bit, my floppy ear on the side of my head. She placed her head over my bandana covered neck in a loving matter. \"Rita…\" I say timidly. \"Don't you ever scare me like that again. Einstein was the one who had found you and he brought you back because we hadn't seen you for a while. When he brought you back, I can't begin to tell you how worried we all were.\" she said to me. I looked down and sighed in defeat because I knew that they'd react that way. \"I'm sorry, Rita. I really am. All I was doing was trying to get us food.\" I reply, closing my eyes. I felt guilty that I didn't bring food back to feed us. \"Don't worry about it right now, okay? We're just glad that they didn't do much worse. And I should've gone with you.\" Rita said, stepping back from me. I shake my head and lower my head a little. \"No, it's better that I was alone because, they would've hurt you too.\" I retort seriously. She looked down at her forepaws because in a sense I was correct. They would've attacked her as well. \"But, regardless, you should've known that you weren't strong enough to take on both of them on your own.\" she said, her protective side taking over. \"I know that now.\" I sigh, looking down. There was a moment of silence. \"Okay. Those dobermans drive me insane.\" Rita said, shaking her head a bit. I shakily sit down and let my fluffy tail lay behind me. \"Yeah. This is the result of them being absolute jerks.\" I said, releasing a yawn afterwards. \"I'm glad that we agree on this.\" Rita said, smirking a bit. \"Hmm, I bet you wanted to hurt them as much as they hurt me.\" I said, giving a weak yet warming smile. \"You think?\" she chuckled. I chuckled too because she would in fact to that. \"Best friends to the end, huh?\" I say. Rita nudged me in a cute manner. \"You know it, and I'll never let you forget it either.\" she said in a sassy yet caring manner. That's when we suggested to wake the others up because we were supposed to get the cat back. By the time midday arrived, I was feeling right as rain. Even though my fur was partially ripped out, but I knew that it'll grow back. But we haven't forgotten about the payback we're going to give Roscoe and Desoto because I didn't deserve that beat down. But right now, we have another task at hand; getting our friend and member back. We hid in the thick bushes and waited for the girl that had the cat when they got here the other day. \"Bye Winston! Goodbye Oliver!\" she said, getting my ears to raise. Oliver? Did she name the cat? Well, it's safe to say that I have something to call him instead of calling him 'the cat'. Once she left, we pop out of the bushes to put our rescue mission into action. \"Alright, listen up. We checked it out. All we got to do is…\" Dodger started before the sound of pounding was heard in the window. We all look up to see that old man hitting something in his hands. \"Oh man! He's dead meat now!\" Tito said in a worried tone. I shook my head and cleared my head to think straight. \"He won't be when we get in there.\" I say, baring my teeth a little. \"Yes, I'll handle that ruffian.\" Francis said, now determined. We had to keep a clear head because with a house as fancy as this, we know that they won't easily allow street dogs like us into it. We all hid behind the beam that had kept us completely out of cover from that old man. As we hid, Einstein used his nose to ring the doorbell. \"Einy!\" Dodger whispered, getting the Great Dane's attention. \"Get out of there!\" Dodger scolded. Einstein realized he couldn't be there and he quickly got off the steps and to where we were. Just then, that old man opened the door and asked who was there. But we saw that Francis was laying on the foot of the steps in a dramatic manner. \"You!\" the old man exclaimed, holding a rolling pin in his hand and held it up as if he was going to hit Francis with is as he pulled the old man down the stairs so that we all could get inside the house. The first thing that came to mind when we entered this place was, 'There's got to be more than just two humans living here.' It was like a castle in here! It was so fancy in here and clean to the point of evidence of our paws being in the dirty streets of New York. \"Miralo! Look at this place! Check it out!\" Tito exclaimed, taking interest of this fancy place. I looked around with my ears raised. \"Man, Francis, this place suits you just fine. Being as sophisticated as you are.\" I chuckle, looking at the fancy interior with a smirk on my face. Francis wore that sophisticated manner like a badge of honor and he was proud of it greatly. I follow Rita into what I can assume to be the family room. \"This place looks pretty nice. I mean, how bad off cut it be here?\" Rita said, also taking interest. \"Hey, man if this is torture then chain me to the wall.\" Tito said, making himself at home. Even though this place is very fancy and nice enough to stay, we needed to still find the cat. We all started to use our noses to find him. The scent was leading me to a seat of curled stairs. I place one of my forepaws on it and look up. \"Guys, up there!\" I call, starting to climb the stairs. The others started to follow me up the stairs. The scent of the cat was definitely up here but which room was he in? In one of the rooms, there was another dog. I tilted my head to the right because this type of dog that looked like a used q-tip or something because she had hair on different parts of her body like on her head, ears, the tip of her tail, her neck and chest, and on all four legs. It looked as if she didn't step foot outdoors before in her life. As she was using a tone of what I can assume to be a fancy thing humans use called 'perfume.' She used a lot of it to fill up the room. Dodger then snuck up behind her while the room was still filled with her sweet smelling smoke. I too came up behind her so that we could give her some interrogation. Once the smoke had faded away, the first thing she did was scream because of us being in her vision in the mirror. \"Who are you two?! What do you want?! Winston!\" she shouted, sitting on the mirror and it began to rock back and forth under her weight. \"Would you calm down?!\" I say before the mirror crashed loudly on the floor, getting Dodger and I to cringe from the noise. She began backing up from Dodger and I because she had no idea who we were and what our intentions were. Especially me because I was half german shepherd and somewhat muscular than her. \"Don't come any closer! I knew this would happen one day.\" the poodle said in a pleading tone. Dodger stood up and raised his stubby yet fluffy tail. \"Well, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. It's not you that my friend and I are after.\" Dodger said, assuring the poodle, who had a paw covering her face. \"It's not? It's not?! Well, why not? What's the problem, spot and you insignificant half breed? Not good enough for you two?\" the poodle said, stepping closer to us with a disgusted look on her face. \"Why would I be into you? I'm not a male.\" I said, feeling offended. She scoffed at my remark because I was a female dog and a half breed I wasn't worth anything in her eyes. However, I don't care about her petty insult towards me because I love who I am. \"So what? I bet you two don't even know who I am, do you?\" the poodle said. She was already getting on my nerves because she seemed so conceited and it annoyed me. She wanted us to know about all her accomplishments and it showed just how spoiled she was. \"Six time national champion!\" she yelled in our faces. \"Well, we're all very impressed. Right guys?\" Dodger said, trying to sugar coat it. All I did was roll my eyes at this because why would I be friends with a show off? But there was someone who was attracted by her looks and her achievements. \"Very impressed.\" Tito said, crawling to her like the love sick puppy he is. She, of course, was appalled by Tito's lovestruck demeanor towards her. And frankly, I don't blame her for reacting that way because I don't like being hit on either. And my rejection resulted in my beating. Tito took her by her forepaw and he kissed it. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Igancio Alonzo Julio Frederico de Tito.\" Tito said, saying his confusing yet long full name. \"Get away from me, you little bug eyed creep! Winston!\" the poodle exclaimed. Tito falls on his chin with a cheeky grin on his face. I just rolled my eyes and trotted over to where Rita was, who was looking at a picture of another dog with a big smile on his face. \"Excuse me, sister, who's Rex?\" she asked with curiosity. The poodle then jumps in front of us with anger. \"None of your business!\" she screeched. That angered me and I raised my tail. \"She was just asking!\" I growl. \"You stay out of this, you half breed!\" the poodle growled at me. I growled because of her judging me the way she is. Soon enough, she was getting onto Einstein and Francis because they were messing with her chocolates and her powder of some sort. When Einstein sneezed the powder, sending the room in a cloud of unbreathable dust. The French Poodle started to lose her patience with us. She growled at us with her teeth bared. \"Alright! That tears it! All of you yo-yo's clear out! And I mean now! Winston!\" she sneered, not wanting anything to do with us. I, for one, couldn't be the only one irritated by this because the only reason we're here in the first place is to get our cat friend. \"Relax, champ. We'll leave once we get our cat back.\" Dodger said, looking the other way. This caught the poodles attention. Her demeanor automatically changed at the very mention of the cat. \"You're cat? Haha, how stupid of me. You must be the friends he must keep talking about.\" The poodle said, rightfully embarrassed. I raised my fluffy tail at what she said. \"Right. So let us get our cat from here and we'll be on our way. You won't hear from us again. Especially from Tito over there.\" I say, in a whisper while looking at an lovestruck chihuahua. The look on the poodle's face went white as she realized she wanted nothing to do with Tito. He didn't exactly make a good first impression. Just then, we all heard footsteps coming up the stairs. We all went into a panic for a brief moment. \"Hide…!\" the poodle urged. And we all did without question. Dodger pretended to be one of the bed posts with a pot on his head. Einstein and Francis hid under the poodle's blanket. I pretended to be one of those rugs that humans often had in fancy houses. I think at least. My head laid outstretched with my tongue hanging out and my eyes shut. Rita was acting like one of the dog shaped posts. And we had Tito hanging on the door by his bandana. We hear the door open and I got into character. It lasted for just a minute. When he closed the door, I quickly get back to my german shepherd paws and lift my fluffy tail a little. \"Shh. Quick. Before he comes back.\" the poodle, apparently named Georgette as I heard from that human, said in a hushed to us. At that point, she was willing to help us. I'm glad for that. She led us to what I can only assume to be that little girls room. Sleeping on the bed, was the kitten. He was curled up into a ball and just… slept soundly. Seeing him like this made me realize that coming here wasn't worth it. Both of my ears lower a bit. \"Look at him, Dodge… Let's just… forget the whole thing.\" Rita said, abstaining to 'rescuing' the cat. \"Yeah Dodger… he seems fine to me. We shouldn't take him…\" I said, lowering my head along with my ears. Seeing him here had me thinking that he's better off staying here where he'll feel safer. He's with someone who loves him and will take good care of him. \"No, you can't do that. You don't understand! The poor dear's so traumatized!\" Georgette urged. Just then, that human's voice could be heard right outside the door. Just then, Georgette picked up the cat by his neck hide and flung him into a pillowcase that Einstein and Francis held open. \"Huh? What?\" the cat exclaimed before being thrown into the pillowcase. The second he was in there, it was tightened up so he wouldn't escape. It made me feel so awful that, despite Rita and I's decision on leaving him here where he's happy, they went ahead and did what they did. \"Here, use the fire escape.\" Georgette inquired to us, opening the window so we could get out. We all jumped out from the window and followed down the trail of metal steps to get down to the alley way that was located at the back of the house. Dodger and I were the last ones to get out. I looked up at the fire escape with both ears raised and my tail halfway raised. Tito was the only one who didn't come with us. I can think of one reason why that was. \"As fancy as that dog is, he's never going to win her over.\" I said. Dodger agreed with me on that. And I found to be right when I saw Tito being slapped right out of the window, falling down the metal stairs. With each step, he let out a yelp. Once he reached the bottom of the steps. \"Ooh! I think she likes me man!\" he sang, his headband over his eyes. He was stumbling around and tried to get his footing. We all started to run back to the houseboat to meet up with the others. As we ran, I looked down at the chihuahua with a furrowed brow. \"Yeah, I don't think that's the case, Tito.\" I chuckle, hearing my claws click against the sidewalk as I ran. The whole time we ran back there, practically kidnapping the cat didn't leave my mind. Even though I lived on the streets with my own gang, I didn't feel right about taking him from there. I… felt… awful.[Chapter 6] By the time we came back to the houseboat, it was late afternoon. We had gotten the cat back there and almost everyone was in an uproar that our mission was successful. All the boys were thrilled about this who scenario. Rita and I weren't. They didn't see how peaceful the cat was when we got in there. If it were up to me, I'd say we're not taking him. We know he's safe and sound here. And we took him away from the one person that seemed to take care of him. Einstein dropped the bag and the cat rolled out of it. He looked up at us with a look that I can only describe as confusion. It only made me feel worse. \"Hey, what's going on you guys?\" the cat asked, rolling on his back to look at us. \"Just committed the rescue of the century!\" Tito announced, bouncing everywhere with his skinny tail wagging furiously. The cat stood up and focused his eyes on each of us. \"R-Rescue?\" he asked confused. \"You should've seen Frankie with that butler!\" Tito howled. Francis was beside himself and smiled proudly. \"I was rather good wasn't I?\" Francis boasted. I sat down with both hind legs under me and both ears lowered. I didn't have anything to say about this. \"How about Tito and Miss. Six Time National Champion?\" Dodger said, strutting pass the cat, lifting all his paws off the floor. The cat was still confused as to why we took him from that house. \"What? I don't understand…\" he said, lowering his ears. We grew silent and looked at him. I felt concern for the cat and I stood on my German Shepherd paws and walked next to Rita. She too looked regretful of taking him from his home. \"You okay kid?\" she asked the cat, lowering her head in concern. \"Yeah… I'm fine.\" the cat answered. \"Is it something we… did?\" I asked, feeling even more profoundly guilty than I already was. \"I was happy there! Why'd you guys take me away?\" the cat scolded. We all fell silent once again. I gaze at Rita with sad eyes and my German Shepherd head lowered. Both of my ears were lowered all the way. \"We rescued you, kitty. We brought you home.\" Einstein kindly answered, lowering his Great Dane head to look at the cat. The cat didn't see this as his home anymore… I knew that he was happy where he was. We had no right to take him away. \"But… I have another home now. And with someone who loves me.\" the cat said sadly, lifting his cat ears. Dodger tilted his head in confusion and he stood up on his paws. \"What do you mean, kid? You're in the gang. And the gang means 'family.' We risked a whole lot to get you out of there.\" Dodger said, walking around the cat. \"And Rose here would've been our last member if we hadn't taken you in.\" he continued. I closed both eyes and look down. He wasn't wrong about that I will admit. I'm the youngest out of everyone here aside from the cat. But… I don't know anymore. \"All I ever wanted was…\" the cat continued before he was cut off. \"What, this place no good for you anymore? Don't want to mess with the riff-raff?\" Dodger asked, starting to get angry with the cat. I open my eyes and just looked at the cat. \"N-No! I do like you guys. I like everyone of you but… there was a little girl. I just want to go back.\" the cat said, trying his hardest to get us to understand. \"We shouldn't have taken him, Dodger.\" Rita said, realizing he was right. \"We were wrong to do that… we're sorry.\" I admit, feeling guilty and regretful. The cat looked at me for a second before looking at an angry Dodger. \"You want to leave? Fine! There's the door!\" Dodger spat, walking away to the door. How can he be so selfish about this? \"But he just got here!\" Einstein said in shock. He was really kicking the cat out… I lowered my German Shepherd head with both ears lowered because I've never seen Dodger this upset with anything. I've known him for 4 years and… seeing him this upset made me upset. It hurt me to see Dodger get this mad… especially for something that someone else wanted. It's for the right reasons… \"Hey Dodger man… lighten up.\" Tito nervously said, walking up to him. \" You lighten up. If he wants to go. Then by all means, let him.\" Dodger angrily stated, jumping up on the recliner with his back facing us. He didn't want to see the cat leave. We all had the same feeling at this time. I lower my German Shepherd head in dejection. Now everyone was regretting on having the cat back with us. This was the worst feeling that I ever had right next to being abandoned alone. He started to go up the stairs. About 4 steps in, Fagin came down the stairs. When I looked up at him, he had a look of despair on his face. \"Oh, it's hopeless.\" he moaned, picking the small cat up and walking down the stairs to go to his chair. Dodger had jumped off of it so Fagin could sit down. We all walk up to him with concerned looks on their faces. It looked like he had given up altogether with trying to find money for that coward. He didn't even know that I gotten beaten up by his lap dogs. He had sat down lazily with the cat in his lap. I lift myself up so that I stood on my hind paws. I leaned against the chair arm. \"What's this?\" he said, inspecting the collar that the car was wearing. \"So that's where you've been. Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, Oliver.\" he started, petting the cat. Oliver? That's his name. It suits him pretty well. \"Your owner probably spends more money on catnip then we do on food for a month. He's probably worried sick about you. All alone in that big house with only his money to comfort him. Only his millions of dollars to…\" he sulked, slumping in his chair before he started chuckling loudly, rising up in his chair. \"That's it! We're saved!\" he exclaimed, starting to prance around the room. I ended up skidding backwards against the wood floors because of how much he was prancing around. The others had to move as well because he would've stepped on them if they hadn't done so. He winded up grabbing a piece of paper from one of the bins in here and went over to the ironing board and began to write something down. He was planning on ransoming Oliver in hopes that the girl or man know he's missing and hope to bring a good amount of money to hopefully pay off that psycho. Frankly, I couldn't say that it was a good idea but it's his last possible chance of being free from him.[Chapter 7] By the time evening came, Fagin was going to put his plan into action. I knew it wasn't going to be easy but we had no choice with this one. He brought Dodger and I with him while the others waiting on the same dock of where I was attacked before. Needless to say, Rita had told us to be careful because that man can do anything to hurt us. It doesn't matter what. He'll just do it. Once night came around, the three of us go up to where that dastardly man's place. It was like what I imagined it to be. Huge, eerie, and probably no doubt expensive to run. My fur bristled up a way that showed how nervous I was feeling but thankfully both Fagin and Dodger are here to make me feel comforted and secured some. When we got to the top, Fagin was starting to rehearse of what he was going to say to that man. I sat down and looked up at Fagin with raised ears and sought interest of what he was doing. \"This is an airtight plan, Sykes. Sweet and simple. I ransom the kitty, and you get paid in full tomorrow. I'll even toss a little extra for your patience.\" he said, guffawing at what he said, \"Whaddya say? It's my final offer Take it or leave it?\" He held out his hand to Dodger and I. We each put our paws into his hand to shake it. Once that was over with, Fagin walked to the buzzer and pressed the button. I backed up a bit and waved my fluffy German Shepherd tail back and forth. \"Yeah who is it?!\" the voice on the other end screeched. Fagin cowered down as the security camera focused on him. I looked up at it and bare my teeth a bit. I knew who was looking at us through the other end. \"Fagin, it's you. Why didn't you say so?\" he questioned, not surprised. Dodger and I started walking around the small platform. \"Oh! Good question. But if you're busy… we can drop by some other time.\" Fagin said, getting close to that camera. \"Don't be silly. Just push the door.\" Sykes said in a lighthearted tone. The door buzzes and I look at Fagin, who was pulling on the door. After a few good tugs, Sykes corrected him. Fagin then flies through the door and Dodger and I followed suit into what I can only assume to be an elevator. When we make it, the first thing my eyes catch is his doberman's sitting at each side. They give Dodger and I both dirty looks. \"Ah! Fagin, come in. I'll be right with you.\" Sykes greeted. I sit down next to Dodger so that we were on each of his side. Fagin tried saying what he rehearsed but found himself stumbling at each word. I tilt my head to the right and furrowed my brow in confusion. My ears flattened and rose again. Just then, Roscoe and Desoto started going towards him in threatening growls. I too growled in a protective manner and lowered my head baring my teeth. Dodger did the same. We both got in front of Fagin in order to protect him. I raise my fluffy tail to show that I wasn't playing around. These mutts have already taken me down once but I'm ready for a fight. A fair fight this time. Just then, that psycho snapped both of his fingers once again. Both doberman's jumped at Fagin with their teeth bared all the way. \"No! No, please Sykes!\" Fagin yelled in panic. I snarl intensively at the dobermans and felt my German Shepherd side come out. I jump at the dobermans and start to bite them with all the strength that I had. Dodger too fought alongside me. I growled loudly as well as bark viciously as I attacked the dobermans. However, I took several blows from the dobermans. Dodger did as well. When one of the dobermans was on top of him, he started scratching the dobermans throat. I quickly sprinted towards the dobermans and sink my teeth into his neck to get him off of Dodger. They growled loudly and furiously at the both of us. The other doberman grabbed me by my back skin and they ripped me away from him. I was quickly to get up to my German Shepherd paws and keep my teeth bared. Dodger was down and he too quickly got to his paws. I jumped on the dobermans back and tugged at the back of his neck viciously. However, I was overpowered. Blow after blow after they gave Dodger and I. When Sykes snapped his fingers again, they threw Dodger on the floor. He let out a pained yelp and landed on the floor with a hard thud. I too was hurt from the constant inflicts from the dobermans. I was limping heavily at the soreness in all of my legs. I was whimpering with my German Shepherd head lowered. I walked over to Dodger and Fagin. My legs gave out and my head was on Fagin's lap. The blows that those dobermans once again inflicted on me were reopened. Dodger was now hurt by them and they didn't care… I closed my eyes and felt Fagin gently stroking our heads to comfort us. I whimpered with each breath because my body was aching. Our attempts of protecting Fagin left us in bruises…[Chapter 8] Shortly after that drastic encounter with Sykes, the three of us went back outside to wait for whoever owned that house where Oliver lives at. I was still limping heavily after being attacked by Roscoe and Desoto all the while protecting Dodger, who was limping also. We were both equally injured. Fagin went a few feet from we were at. I had both ears lowered as well as my head because my entire body was still hurting. We limped our way back to Rita, Einstein, and Tito, who were waiting on us. \"Oh Dodge… Rose…\" Rita sadly said. Dodger lifted his head and lifted his half floppy ears to assure her. \"Hey Rita. They never laid a paw on us.\" Dodger said lightly. \"Yeah. We're a little banged up but otherwise okay.\" I agreed, shaking my black and brown fur. I didn't want Rita to worry about either of us. I was still a little sore but I was able to walk at least. \"Oooh! I'll tear them mongrels limb from limb!\" Tito growled, getting into his feisty stage. We all lightly laugh at Tito's enthusiasm. \"Don't overwork yourself, tough guy. You need to save your energy.\" I say, sitting down and using my left hind leg to scratch my floppy ear. Just then, I hear the sounds of Fagin starting to panic, causing us to look behind us. There was that same girl that was carrying Oliver into the house. She had that poodle, Georgette with her this time. Tito and I had decided to see what was going on. When we got there, the first thing Tito did was make kissing sounds at the poodle who groaned in disgust. I stood next to Fagin on his right side and looked at the girl. She looked frightened to be out in this part of town. \"I can't… I'm lost.\" she said sadly, looking down at that map that Fagin had drawn for her. I lowered my ears in sadness at the girl's expression. She did look lost. To give her some comfort, I walked over to her and gave her a lick on the cheek. She looked over at me and smiled a bit before giving me a couple strokes behind my ear, getting me to tilt my German Shepherd head a little bit. That honestly felt so soothing. \"I'd help you but I'm kinda busy right now.\" Fagin inquired, having his back to her, \"Why're you out here anyway?\" The girl looked up at Fagin with glossy eyes. \"I came to find my kitty!\" she replied. I raised my ears at that. Oliver belonged to her because he did mention that there was a girl who loves him. \"You're kitty?!\" Fagin exclaimed in shock. \"Someone stole 'im.\" the girl stated. I lowered my head in guilt because we were the ones who took him from that house. I had my ears lowered some to show how guilty I was feeling. It did hurt greatly but of course I couldn't tell them that. It soon got to the point where she presented Fagin with a piggy bank of some sort who was disappointed by this. He was expecting more than that. But she said that this was all she had to get Oliver back. I sat down with my German Shepherd tail wrapped halfway around me. Closing my eyes, I tried to block out what was being said around me. Fagin then too felt guilty of holding Oliver for ransom and found it difficult of whether or not he should give him to her. When he dropped the cat into a junk pile, I knew that he was going to reconsider on holding him hostage. I stood on all fours with my German Shepherd tail raised some. \"Hey, guess what?\" Fagin excitedly said, tugging at his hat. The girl looked back at him. \"I found a little lost kitten! I don't know, take a look! Maybe he's yours!\" Fagin said, giving Oliver back. I started wagging my fluffy tail at how happy the girl was at seeing him. Everything seemed to be okay now. Or so I thought. Suddenly, the sound of a car starting hit my ears and I quickly looked over to see… that psycho's car at the very end of the dock. \"Sykes. Sykes!\" Fagin yelled, making an attempt to stop the oncoming car. I stood in front of the girl in an attempt to protect her. Then the car speeds past Fagin and stopped where the girl and I were. Sykes then reaches out of his car and grabs the both of us. He grabbed me by my bandana, almost choking me, and he grabbed the girl by her arm. \"Hey! Let go!\" the girl screamed as we got pulled into the car. \"ROSE!\" the gang screamed, seeing me get pulled in. We were both thrown into the back of the car where the dobermans were. The girl, who's name was Jenny, was sitting behind me clearly scared by this situation. Oliver had been thrown out of the car, which made me so mad. When I tried to attack him from behind, one of the dobermans took ahold of my bandana to pull me back down to the seat. I yelped from the sudden grab and how hard they pulled me back. Jenny hugged my neck out of fear of Sykes and the dobermans. We were both confused and frightened of what was going to happen next. When I looked out of the back window, I saw the gang along with Oliver and Georgette. My ears lowered because I can't imagine how scared the were of not only seeing Jenny get taken but me also. But I had to keep a level head about this. The gang will come to rescue us from this danger we are in.[Chapter 9] Back at the warehouse, Sykes had taken both Jenny and I back to his office. He tied me up by the chair by tying a rope around my neck and the other end was tied to the chair Jenny was sitting in. He made sure that we weren't going anywhere. Jenny was surely scared of Sykes as she was starting to cry and whimpering as the psycho was tying her up. I lower my ears and look up at the little girl. She didn't deserve this… why did he take her? He was now going to desperate measures to get his money. And why did he take me? It didn't make sense to me… \"Now don't cry little girl. They only eat when I tell them to. And if that mutt tries anything, I'll let them finish her.\" he threatened, Roscoe and Desoto slowly circling us while growling lowly. They eyed me as if they were ready to spring. I bare my teeth a bit because of the threat made against both Jenny and I. No one was going to hurt her while I was here. The dobermans then faced me with their teeth bared. \"Don't try nothing, Rose. We don't want to hurt you like we did before.\" Roscoe threatened, keeping his eyes straight on me. \"You made a big mistake taking us on last time, you half breed.\" DeSoto agreed. I growled back at them and raised my German Shepherd tail. \"You two are so lucky I'm tied up right now. You'd be finished. I'm half German Shepherd and I'll use that side to finish you.\" I growl. They just laughed at me. \"That won't matter when we put you in the ground.\" Roscoe stated, going back to Sykes with DeSoto. After a bit, Sykes goes back to his desk with Roscoe and Desoto sitting beside him. All I could do right now was lay down and hope that Dodger and them would find us. Both of my forelegs were in front of me with my German Shepherd head on them so it laid on the right side of them. I did know not to go to sleep because I needed to know if the gang was coming after us. Not soon after, my ears twitch at the close sound of what I can only describe as glass shattering. My head jerked up and I looked behind me with my ears raised. Sykes then sends Roscoe and Desoto to investigate. The two dogs walked passed us slowly, paying no mind to either of us. Relief washed over me because I knew exactly who made that noise. I knew that the gang was here to get out of here. And I turned out to be right as my eyes pan to the security cameras behind Sykes and I see the gang standing in front of the cameras. That made me feel so relieved because I knew they wouldn't leave us here. The camera then suddenly shuts off, indicating that Tito must've bit the wire so they wouldn't get caught. I slide up to a sitting position with my forepaws pressed onto the ground but my German Shepherd tail still laying behind me on the floor. Even though I was happy to see the gang, I had to remain cool and not struggle to get myself free. The rope around my neck was tight enough and I can't make it worse. I looked over at Jenny, who looked back at me who had that same look of relief because of seeing Oliver in the camera. My ears lower as I look at her. Sykes then proceeds to tell Winston about getting Jenny's father on the phone about her kidnapping. He didn't mention me. I think he only took me because of me being a half breed dog? He had targeted me before for hoping to get the money faster out of Fagin. None of it made any sense. Then, a few knocks at the door made Sykes put the phone down in hearing it. I stand up and turn my body around with my ears raised to see that it was none other than Tito, Francis, and Einstein disguised as a pizza man to get Sykes' attention. \"I didn't order any pizza.\" he seethed, getting up from his desk with a loaded gun in his hand. When he walked by us, I backed up a bit and into Jenny. As long as we're here, nothing is going to happen to this little girl. Even if it kills me, I'll protect her from Sykes and Roscoe and Desoto. Just then, I see the gang walk in with Oliver in tow. All except Tito and Georgette. Wonder how they're getting along. Dodger quickly came over to me and bit one the rope that was wrapped around my neck. Once he got me off of there, I shook my fur at how tight those bindings were. Oliver happily jumps up to Jenny's shoulders and the two reunite once again. I smiled at this because I saw how happy they were together. But we had to be cautious because Sykes could come back any minute. \"Dodger? Where's the others?\" I whisper, lowering my head and raising my ears. \"Keeping Sykes distracted.\" he responded. \"Yo, we're here!\" Tito said, coming in with the gang behind him. Francis was going to keep an eye for Sykes because we had to get Jenny out of here before he returns. Rita proceeds to untie Jenny. I stayed by Jenny and Oliver to protect them while Rita was untying her. Before she could get all the way through, I could hear footsteps beginning to make their way back down here. Dodger rushed to Francis, who was watching something else when he was supposed to be watching for Sykes. When Dodger turns it back to the security cameras, Sykes was coming down the corridor with Roscoe and Desoto. \"Oh goodness!\" Francis exclaimed, seeing them. \"What do you we do, Dodger?\" Rita asked, seeming worried. I had my head raised up along with my tail. When I looked up at the wires, an idea popped back into my head. \"Hey, Tito, the wire.\" I said, to which he objects instantly. \"Yeah, that's our way out.\" Dodger agreed. \"Hey, no way Rose and Dodger! I've been barbequed too many times!\" Tito protested. He's the only one smallest dog in the gang so he fits the bill. \"Good luck, Alanzo. I'll be waiting…\" Georgette said, fluttering her eyes in a flirtatious way at Tito. \"You might just get her if ya do this, Romeo.\" I lower my head at Tito with a teasing look on my face. At this, Tito had changed his mind because it would seem that he had finally won her over. \"Hey, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho! It's off to work we go!\" Tito sang as he proceeded to jump on random boxes to get to the wires. I jump on Jenny's lap with all of my legs tucked next to me so I wouldn't fall off. Everyone else got onto a place on the chair as we waited for Tito to get the us out of there. \"C'mon Tito…\" Dodger urged. When we got hooked up, Tito had connected the wires again and we all began to lift up off the ground with a loud whirring sound. My eyes pan down to see that Sykes, Roscoe and DeSoto broke through the door that the gang had locked behind them. The dobermans jumped up at us in an attempt to bite us but ended up missing. We were all riding along the electrical crane in a fast pace. My fur blew in front of me because we're going backwards. We were all yelling from the speed of the crane. Next thing I know, we were falling from the crane from very high up. I was falling face first while yelling out because the ground was getting closer, and closer, and closer. But what we landed on wasn't the floor, it was a conveyor belt. Dodger was the first in front of us before Oliver, me, Rita, Einstein, Tito, Francis, Georgette, and Jenny. My hind legs were up slightly as we slid down the conveyor belt at a very fast pace. We went down a few turns before getting to the bottom. Sykes was at the bottom with Roscoe and DeSoto at his sides. We all looked at him with shocked expressions because we had believed that we had escaped. \"This has all been very entertaining, but the party is over.\" Sykes chuckles, holding his hand up with two fingers pressed together as if he was getting ready to snap his fingers. He was going to finish us off.[Chapter 10] \"This has been all very entertaining. But the party is over.\" Sykes said in a chuckle, holding two of his fingers up as he was ready to snap his fingers. But before he could do that, the familiar sound of Fagin's scooter horn filled the air and he busted through the window while on his scooter. \"Ow-oh-oh-ow! Uh! C'mon! Let's go!\" Fagin shouted, screeching to a stop. We all didn't hesitate to get in the basket of the scooter. I was in the back with Dodger, Oliver, and Tito and my German Shepherd forepaws hanging over the railing. We all sped out of there the second we boarded. \"Fagin!\" Sykes yelled in anger. Roscoe and DeSoto started to run after us. But we were too fast for them. Their image was getting smaller and smaller. \"Heh-heh! Hey man! You're ugly! And you're uglier than him! You're ugly part 3! The revenge of the ugly!\" Tito taunted as we completely lost sight of the dobermans. \"We really showed them!\" I shouted, before the speeding engine of Sykes's car was making an appearance. \"Spoke too soon there!\" Tito gasped. That car was picking up speed to where he was close to bumping us. Fagin yelled out before picking up speed as well. This human was absolutely crazy! What's it going to take for him to leave us alone?! We were going down a flight of subway stairs, bumping our way down. Sykes was now following us down the stairs, knocking off his side view mirrors. We were now in the subway and on the tracks in hopes of losing him. But that didn't work because he made his way onto the tracks also, causing his tires to completely fall off the rim so lightning flew from the rim. There were so many humps and bumps on the tracks that it was difficult for Fagin to drive straight. He then bumped the back of the scooter so hard that Jenny winded up falling out of the back. She landed on the hood of his car. Sykes punched through the window and grabbed her arm tightly. My protective instincts kicked in as well as Oliver's and we both jumped out of the basket. Oliver doesn't hesitate to sink his small teeth into Sykes's finger. \"Agh!\" the man yelled from the sudden pain and he throws him in the back. I bare my teeth and the minute Sykes stuck out his hand again, I don't hesitate to bite him as hard as I could, sinking my fangs deep into his skin. He screamed from the pain and managed to shake me off. I've always wanted to bite that psycho. I then saw that Oliver was being cornered by Roscoe and DeSoto. \"Dodger! The kid's in trouble!\" I yell, getting his attention. \"I'm right with you!\" he shouted over the noise before Dodger used his hind legs to join me. The two of us jump through the sunroof and land on the backseat. I once again sink my teeth into Roscoe's neck and I grab ahold of his neck fur and skin with a tight grip and I shook my head violently. In his reaction, he caused both of us to fly through the back window of the car. The glass shattered behind us and we were now on the trunk of the car. My actions caused him to nearly fall off the car. When trying to grab me, I end up using my head to push him completely off so that the lightning surged through his body. The doberman let out a pained yelp as he was taken away by the lightning. Dodger met up with me so that we were both on the back. \"I killed him… Roscoe is dead…\" I said slightly shakily because I bucked up the courage to throw one of our enemies over the edge. Dodger ended up nuzzling me to comfort me but only for a second before DeSoto made his final appearance. He ended up tackling Dodger down as well as knocking me out of the way. Dodger let out a yelp of pain as DeSoto was pushing down on his head to hurt Dodger. I was about to save him but Oliver beat me to it. The cat jumped onto DeSoto's head and it freaked the doberman out. He yelped all while rearing up; he lost his balance and fell into the fiery tracks below, killing him instantly. Dodger picked him up by his neck hide and held him there. We were outside once again but on a bridge. I jumped back on the hood. \"Mr. Fagin! Mr. Fagin help me!\" Jenny cried, holding on to the front piece of the car. Fagin came to the back of the scooter. When he had grabbed her by the leg, I didn't hesitate to once again bite down on his hand with a protective growl. \"AGH!\" he yelled. I held on tightly this time and didn't hesitate to let go. I shook my German Shepherd head roughly in hopes of doing real damage. Just then, I saw the form of what I can only make out to be on coming train headed our direction. I felt scared at first because if that train were to hit us head on, we would be killed instantly. Oliver then pounces on Sykes's hand so I could let go. I immediately let go the second Oliver jumped on him and I backed up enough to do a swift jump back into the basket of the scooter. Jenny jumped in the basket after Oliver got a hold of him. When I looked over, Tito was behind the wheel of the scooter but I didn't question it. \"ALANZO!\" Georgette screamed as the train got closer and closer but Tito made the smart move of pulling up to the rising beams of the bridge to get out of the way. I couldn't help but look down as the train collided with the car. Sykes was killed on impact with the train. As the chaos died down, we all slowly slid down the beam slowly. We weren't out of the woods just yet. Where was Oliver and Dodger? Once we reached the bottom of the beam, Jenny jumped out. \"Oliver?\" she whimpered, starting to sob. As she said his name, we see Dodger limp slowly in our direction with Oliver in his mouth by his neckhide. \"No…\" I gasp, both of my ears dropping and my eyes widening. I too jump out and run alongside Jenny with the others behind us. When we stopped by him, I was shocked to see that… Oliver wasn't breathing. I lowered my head and began to whimper in sadness. Sykes couldn't have killed him… My heart was starting to break. But then, the sound of a soft meow got me to perk up, and I lift my head up. \"Oliver? Oliver!\" Jenny exclaimed, her expression brightening at seeing Oliver alive. We all brightened up and I began to wag my fluffy tail happily and I couldn't help but lick the girl on the face. She giggled and petted me behind the ears. She petted Dodger also between his partially floppy ears. Everything was okay again… Sykes and his dastardly dobermans weren't going to bother us anymore. In excitement, I rolled over onto my back. She ended up rubbing my belly and it felt sooo good! Now we can all go home safely. Only one more chapter my good people! It's sad to see this story end with Rose but I'll also get to write a sequel with Rose! Stay tuned for that.[Chapter 11] It had just been under a week since that final encounter with Sykes and his dobermans. Everything was as it should be. We were living peacefully again without them constantly hanging over our shoulders. We can live freely again. It felt so amazing to finally just be ourselves again. Today, we were celebrating Jenny's birthday and Winston had invited all of us to be there since we saved Jenny's birthday. I was sitting next to Dodger on his right while Oliver sat on his left, next to Jenny, who was wearing a red dress. Winston and Fagin were singing Happy Birthday while we all howled along. I barked happily with my tail wagging and my tongue hanging out. \"Alright, anybody want some cake?\" Jenny offered. Einstein had his eyes all on it. \"Alright Einstein but not all it!\" Jenny laughed. I happily barked as I wanted some as well. \"I certainly wouldn't leave you out, Rosie.\" she said, petting me between my ears. I licked her hand in a friendly manner. She gave me a slice of cake and I devoured it instantly. It tasted so awesome! And while I was eating it, the sound of Tito's annoying music was playing in the background. \"Ugh… seriously?\" I groan, seeing not only him but Georgette dancing with it. It did make me happy to see our little Romeo finally get his Juliet. Such a casanova. Afterwards, we all went into the kitchen to open up some presents with Jenny. I had taken my seat in front of her with my tail raised. She opened up the one I gave her. It was an old book that I found a couple of days ago. Spending time with Jenny and Oliver along with the gang has to be one of the best times that I ever did. I couldn't be more happier to be with them at this moment in time. But it had to come to an end at some point. Fagin came into the room saying that it was time to go home. That was alright because we could come back here anytime under the influence of Winston. \"Francis, Rita, Rose, Tito, vamanos! The streets are calling!\" Fagin called. \"Jennifer, what have we forgotten?\" Winston reminded. \"Oh yeah! Thanks everyone! The gifts are great!\" Jenny replied, hugging us in a way of thanking us. I once again gave her a lick on the face while wagging my tail. I walked out of the house and into the streets as I awaited for the rest of the gang. As I stood there, I began to think of all of what we've been through in the last few days. It was insane to say the least. There was no other way of describing it. The thrill and adrenaline that coursed through our veins felt unlike anything we've ever experience before. Meeting this kitty was the best thing that happened to our gang. Our family. He's officially apart of our family even if he's living with Jenny. We all met outside with Oliver as Fagin was starting up the scooter. Everyone except Tito. Guess he needed a little extra time with his new girlfriend. \"Bye-bye, kitty.\" Einstein said. \"See ya around kid.\" Rita said, slightly nudging him. \"We shall meet again, Oliver.\" Francis quoted. \"Goodbye you guys.\" Olive stated, looking at us with slightly saddened eyes. \"I'll catch up with you guys in a moment guys.\" I said, shaking my head. They agreed and took off after the scooter. Dodger and I stayed behind. \"Listen kid. You, Rose, and I just want to hang out or anything-?\" Dodger said, stretching his limbs. Just then, Tito rushes out of the house… wearing a sailor suit! I almost started laughing at how ridiculous he looked. \"Aiee-hee!\" he screeched, hiding behind Dodger and I. \"Whoa! What happened to you? Gettin' pampered by your Juliet?\" I laughed. \"Oi, I can't get this woman off me! Man, I gotta get her away from me!\" he groaned, trying his hardest to get the suit off him. Once he heard Georgette in the window, he got it off and took off running. Of course he said his goodbyes to Oliver before leaving. I chuckle at him. \"Well, kid, guess I'll be seeing ya. Just remember, we can always drop by for a visit from time to time. Don't forget that.\" I said, giving the cat a friendly yet confident look. \"I'll keep my eyes open.\" Oliver happily said. \"You think you can handle the champ?\" Dodger said, pulling one of his high five jokes on Oliver but it ended up getting reversed on him. \"Hey. You're cool. For a cat.\" Dodger said with a grin. He then stands up and says to me, \"You ready to hit the road, Rose?\" My tail wags at that. \"You know I am, Dodge.\" I smile and we take off to find the others. This wouldn't be the last time we would see Oliver but us dogs would get back to what we do best. Living freely in the Big Apple. Living in the heart of New York City. The place to call home and forever I'll call it that. Nothing will change this. Not as long as we live. Hence the last chapter of Streets of Gold. But it's not over yet! There will be a sequel coming out very soon! So stay tuned and stay awesome![Chapter 12]  ","Summary":" The city that never sleeps. New York City. The city that I call home ever since I was just a puppy."},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"Stories from the Streets","Author":"AlleyHound","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10314241","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Stories from the Streets Contents: Storm of Central Park Chapter 1: The Odd Couple Chapter 2: Breaking Up Chapter 3: Loneliness Chapter 4: Chloe's Gift Sisters Reunited Chapter 1: Reunited Chapter 2: Moving Forward Chapter 3: Bittersweet Parting[Chapter 2] Storm of Central Park A bolt of lightning illuminated all but the darkest crevices of the lonely alleyway; previously hidden rats flashing into visibility for a moment, and then creeped on in the black night. The alley was lined by many trashcans, dumpsters and heaped piles of junk, so it was small wonder that there was many a rodent calling it home. Disturbed by the thunder, lightning and howling winds of the wild night, a thin dog lifted his head from his sleeping place. The weather didn't scare him. He, along with his siblings, Thunder, Rain, Lightning and Howl, were named for the storm that had raged on the very night of their birth. The name, Storm, gave a distinct impression of wildness, and the dog had always been fond of it. By coincidence, there had been a thunderstorm on the other most important day of the young dog's life as well; the day he'd finally decided he'd had enough of being neglected by his humans and had taken off on a long journey to the big city. The heavy rain left Storm shivering, but it stirred in him an exhilaration; the sheer power of these forces of nature reminding him than anything was possible. A former pet, he was now a street dog, a stray. By all expectations- even his own if he was brutally honest, he should have died by now. He was a mix of Afghan and saluki, two breeds not renowned for their road sense. After a few near misses, Storm was confident that he could avoid a clash with the underside of a car if he just kept his wits about him. Other breed traits, he discovered, served him well- he was a skilled hunter and a resourceful thief, not needing the direction of any human master. He was his own master. Even as a young dog of not much more than a year old, he had proved himself to be strong and capable. Storm didn't need anybody, and he was perfectly happy that way. Trying to get comfortable so he'd drift back to sleep, Storm squirmed in his plastic trash bag. Ever the resourceful one, he'd torn it open and emptied the contents; once he'd eaten anything worth picking at, he'd wriggled inside. It acted as a sort of sheet or raincoat, keeping him dry as the rain came down. Just because Storm wasn't frightened by wild weather, didn't mean he wanted to get soaking wet. He closed his eyes. Would this thunder storm be heralding another new chapter in his life? Storm was too tired to give it much thought. Whatever awaited him, he'd see to it once he'd had some decent shut-eye. When the sun rose the next day, it brought about a change- no longer was the sky rumbling with apparent displeasure, no longer did clouds hang overhead. Storm stretched out his lean body, ready to start a new day. He was tall and lanky, his ribs visible beneath his fine red-brown coat. He had a dark mask, and similarly dark fur up his legs, neck, and in his messy topknot. A splash of white on his chest and belly stood out starkly against the deep brown, and it was that which one would see first should he approach from out the shadows. A human might say that Storm was in need of a good grooming, but he himself found his slightly dishevelled appearance to be quite satisfactory. Rising with the sun, Storm knew where his first port of call would be; Central Park. Early each day, the park buzzed with countless dogs, free to play with no leashes to hold them back, with no reason to fear a dog catcher's pole. It wasn't so much the company that appealed to Storm, he didn't really need anyone, but it was the best opportunity to be able to run and play, completely carefree, as he could use the free roaming pets as cover. For all anyone knew, he was just another one. An early morning stretch out on the park was fast becoming part of Storm's routine; a bit of fresh air and space to start each day was welcome in a world that seemed to be largely made up of concrete, metal and shouting humans. The lanky hound was finding his feet in the ever-moving environment that had become his home- after several months of trial and error, he was now comfortably making a living as a street dog and couldn't imagine ever going back to the life of a pet. Today would be just another day in the life of a young dog happily roughing it in New York City. As he arrived at the great park, Storm broke into a jaunty trot, and he held his tail high and merry as he greeted the morning. Already there were pet dogs of all shapes, sizes, colours and breeds running around, and he couldn't wait to join in the frivolities. Storm sped up, and soon he was running off the pavement and through the grass, the early morning dew making the fur on his legs damp. A bounce in every step, he pranced around in his own little world. It was the way he liked it- and while the park belonged to the dogs of the city, there was no reason to watch his back. This was freedom. Out of nowhere, a blurred streak in the corner of his eye caught his attention. He skidded to a halt and looked around, curious- it wasn't often he came across a dog who could move that fast! He watched her, entranced. The dog appeared to be a saluki- a bitch, and her golden fur was stunning in the morning sun. She moved with such grace, and her delicate paws barely seemed to scrape the ground as she effortlessly galloped across the expense of grass. Storm was certain that he'd never seen anyone or anything quite so beautiful in his life. Storm gave a sharp bark, and was thrilled to see the bitch look his way and grin playfully. He jumped into a play bow and raced after her, his tail wagging. Soon, his strides matched hers, and they seemed to be moving as if in perfect harmony. The bitch threw another glance over her shoulder and gave a joyous howl, seemingly loving the game of chase that she'd pulled the handsome stranger into- and he was getting ever closer. It was just what Storm needed to encourage him to ramp up his pursuit, and he threw himself forward. Nearing the lake, and well aware of Storm being hot on her heels, the young bitch saw an opportunity for a bit of mischief. She turned her head to give him a sly grin, and then made a sudden change of direction, taking him by surprise. Going as fast as he was, Storm wasn't prepared for the sharp turn, and found himself falling over his paws and tripping headlong down the bank and into the water. He spluttered and splashed as his lean body was enveloped in cold and his long fur obscured his vision. When he'd managed to shake the soaked fur from his eyes, Storm looked up to see the bitch laughing as she lay spread out on the edge of the water. He found himself grinning, pleased that she hadn't just run off. It was bizarre- why did her company matter so much to him? \"That's a serious turn of speed you've got there,\" the bitch said with a giggle, \"If that lake hadn't got in the way, you might have caught me.\" Storm reached the shore and shook himself, quickly becoming very conscious of the fact that he probably looked something like a drowned rat- a great contrast to the picture of beauty that lay before him. \"Maybe,\" he said, \"we should do this again sometime. See if it wasn't just a fluke that you got away.\" The bitch's eyes lit up and her tail wagged. This handsome- if bedraggled- stranger was charming as well as quick. His dark, thoughtful eyes spoke of his good nature, and she was entranced. \"I come here every morning. If you're around, we could meet at the same place. What about you?\" she asked, and then remembering her manners, added quickly, \"I'm Chloe, by the way. That's not my show name, but it's what people call me.\" \"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Chloe,\" Storm said, wagging his tail. It seemed remarkable to home that this pet- not only a pet, but a show dog - was giving him the time of day, but she seemed just as interested in him as he was in her. \"My name is Storm. There's no one to really call me by it, but it's the one I've got. I can be by the fountain again tomorrow morning, if you find yourself wanting another run.\" Just then, Chloe registered something that had been under her nose the whole time. \"Wait- you don't have a collar!\" Storm nodded. \"No collar, no human. Just me.\" Now he was nervous. If she hadn't realised the sort of dog he was until now, there was every chance she'd just get up and leave. A stray! Chloe was stunned, but yet she couldn't deny the attraction she felt. What harm was there really in her befriending this wild hound? There was no need to shout it from the rooftops to her friends from the shows; whatever might happen would be between her and Storm. Chloe felt suddenly very excited- this had to be the most rebellious thing she'd ever done! \"I guess I'll see you back here tomorrow morning then,\" she said, without a trace of apprehension in her voice. \"No master, huh? I bet you know all the best places to have some fun.\" Scarcely able to believe what he was hearing, Storm yipped with excitement and bounced down on his forequarters, inviting Chloe to play. \" All the best places. If you wanted, I could take you round town one night; if your humans were out the way, we could maybe go for something to eat… and maybe get to know each other a little better.\" Never before had Storm felt inclined to ask someone out on what amounted to a date, but she'd touched something new in him, and he dared to see how far it might go. Delighted, Chloe returned the play bow. \"My masters are going out to a party tonight- if you follow me home you'll know where to find me.\" Then, she sprung forward, launching herself playfully at the other hound. The two dogs chased and frolicked for what must have been an hour or more, with Storm's fur soon drying off in the morning sunshine. An electricity surged between the stray and the show dog, with neither able to keep their eyes off the other for more than a minute. Finally tired and lacking the stamina of her new friend, Chloe found a spot in the sun to sprawl on her belly. Her golden fur shone in the mid-morning light. Panting, Storm joined her. \"So have you always been, you know, a stray?\" Chloe asked tentatively. She'd never so much as talked to a dog without a human before, the very concept being totally alien to her. Of course she'd seen street dogs before- there were plenty of them around the place, but Storm wasn't the savage she'd imagined strays to be. \"A little while now. I was born a pet; I was pretty happy in my birth home, but my second human family didn't care for me. I was just left in the yard all the time with nothing to do and no one to talk to. I figured I could make a better life on my own, and I have done,\" Storm said. \"I couldn't imagine a life without a human,\" Chloe sighed, feeling guilty even at the thought. Her humans were everything to her, and that was what she'd been brought up to believe made a dog a dog. Storm was challenging the way she looked at the world, and she wasn't quite sure what to make of it. \"Chloe! Chloe! Where have you been, you crazy dog!\" Both Chloe and Storm turned, seeing a man running toward them. \"Sorry, Storm, it's my human- I've got to go,\" Chloe said, and she hastily made her way back to her master. Before she reached the man who was panting after running all around the park in search of her, she turned around to call to Storm. \"Even if you don't come around tonight, same place tomorrow morning? I'll be waiting.\" The grin returned to Storm's face. He hadn't thought he'd wanted one, but it seemed he'd found a friend. Storm took the same path he'd taken when following Chloe home, finding himself in front of a tidy apartment building. He wasn't sure if he was expected to try and get in to the building itself- he hoped not, he had no idea how such a move could be pulled off unnoticed. It was a relief when a delicate face appeared around the side of the building. \"Storm! I'm here!\" Chloe's voice shook with excitement; never had she even imagined being such a rebel, but the handsome hound was just too much of a lure. His own heartbeat quickening, Storm barked a happy greeting. He was a little nervous… if this was a date, and he suspected it was, it was something all new to him. A little unsure of himself, he trotted up to her and shyly licked her cheek. \"Glad I found you! Ready to see some sights?\" Chloe's cheeks felt hot, but it was nice… exhilarating. Storm led Chloe through the city streets; even at night there were humans around, and the hound had often wondered if they ever slept. He could sense that Chloe was uneasy, probably, he thought, because she'd never gone anywhere without a human in tow. Storm walked close to her, and hoped that his quiet confidence would rub off. Slowly, her movements became stronger, more self-assured. \"So,\" he said, \"Do you have anything in mind? Have you seen the Statue of Liberty yet? It makes for a nice view this time of night.\" Chloe shook her head. She'd seen remarkably little of the city for someone who'd lived there her whole life- her experiences were limited to those she shared with her humans. \"No, but I'd like to. Really, I'm just interested to see what it's like, having freedom. I've never been able to just run and explore- I want you to show me.\" A grin came to Storm's face. \"I can do that,\" he said softly, \"just come with me.\" Soon, the two of them were running side by side, jumping in every puddle as rain began to fall. Storm couldn't believe he could have so much fun with another dog; it was like nothing he'd ever experienced before. He'd not met anyone with such speed and agility, and as she gained in confidence, Chloe became increasingly silly and playful. For a pampered pet, she wasn't half bad. Chloe followed close on Storm's tail as he led her up winding pathways, higher and higher until they were looking over the Hudson. She gasped at the sight; the water shimmered with the reflected lights of Manhattan, and it was incredibly beautiful. The statue herself stood proudly, and Chloe couldn't say she'd blame her; it was quite the kingdom that Lady Liberty reigned over. \"Pretty, huh?\" Storm said, and he lay himself down. \"It's amazing, Storm,\" Chloe replied, her eyes wide with wonderment. \"You don't see stuff like this when you're on the end of a leash.\" Storm studied her, his expression soft. Chloe seemed so happy in his company- might they have a future as friends or even, and he felt embarrassed to even think it, something more? Being a young loner, Storm hadn't much thought about finding a mate; he just wasn't really interested in most of the bitches he met, but there was just something about Chloe. For the first time, he didn't feel trapped by having company, he was just naturally comfortable around her, and it felt wonderful. As she looked back to him, Storm saw a glimmer of desire- was the attraction mutual? \"Can't say I miss being tied to a human, not when there's a whole world at your paws. You ever thought about becoming your own dog?\" Taken aback by the question, one that challenged everything she'd built her life upon, Chloe frantically shook her head. \"Never! I have humans; they're mine and they're what makes me a real dog.\" \"And what am I?\" Storm asked with a laugh, \"A fish?\" Chloe's expression hardened. \"It's not funny. Our kind have been friends of humans for thousands of years, and that means something. It means everything. Don't you ever feel lonely?\" she asked, perplexed by her new friend. Storm gave her a kind smile. \"I get it; your life is something different. Honestly, I was much lonelier when I had human masters. Now, I'm alone by choice, not because someone just don't care for me. There's a big difference. I'm better without them.\" Chloe looked back to the lights shining over the city. Storm's way of thinking was so different to hers, but she couldn't deny that the life he led intrigued her. She couldn't remember the last time she'd had so much fun, certainly her humans didn't provide her with a whole lot of adventure and excitement. It felt like she was betraying her own masters, but as long as they didn't know, what was the harm in Chloe's spending nights out with this handsome and fascinating stranger? \"I can see why you love this life so much- the whole city at your paws.\" \"How about I show you some more tomorrow night?\" Storm asked hopefully, heartened by Chloe's acceptance of their differences. Her eyes twinkling in the moonlight, Chloe couldn't help but smile. \"I'd really like that.\" Storm found himself smiling back. He moved closer, and gently, their muzzles met. True to her word, Chloe was at the same spot in the park the next morning… and the next, and the next, and the next. Storm's races and playtime with the graceful saluki fast became a highlight of each day, and every morning he found himself more excited to be in her company. He'd gotten into the habit of sleeping in the park overnight- partially because it was more pleasant an environment than cold concrete corners, but more than that, because it made him feel close to his sweet, elegant friend. He could wake up each morning, and know that he'd soon be with her, and it was a wonderful feeling- one that he'd never expected. However much fun the two young lovers had together in the park though, it soon became overshadowed by the nights when Storm would steal Chloe away for a few hours. The days turned to weeks, and the affection between the two hounds grew and grew. Chloe found wonderment in the exciting world that Storm was sharing with her; he'd opened to eyes to a feeling of freedom that she didn't even know was possible. The tenderness with which he regarded her spoke to her heart, and Chloe felt herself falling for the scruffy young stray. Storm found his own eyes opened to new possibilities; that humans could be kind, rather the cruel- but more importantly, that he didn't need to be alone to be happy, it just took someone special to awaken him to the love within himself. She told him of her pampered life with her humans, her show career, and all the places she'd been. Chloe talked rather a lot, but Storm had always been more of a listener than a talker, and he didn't mind one bit. He'd fallen for Chloe hard; he was in love with her, and she brought more joy to his life with each passing day. He couldn't imagine- neither of them could- a life in which they were not together. Neither Storm nor Chloe could foresee the curveball that would soon be thrown their way.[Chapter 3] Chloe stretched her lean body out to its full length with every stride, the light drizzle of rain doing little to dampen the exhilaration that pulsed through her as she galloped down the dark street, Storm at her side. This was what they did now; almost every night she would join him and experience a world far richer than her humans had ever allowed her to see. She lived a double life- by day she was Champion Fleetwind Golden Flower, a pampered show dog of great reputation, but by night she was just plain old Chloe, lover of a wily street dog. Chloe could never mention Storm to any of her dog show friends- as if they'd ever understand? He was a secret, so far removed from the rest of her world that she world that there could be no overlap. Storm let out a howl that bounced off the concrete around him. He was having a whale of a time- each night he'd find himself more and more besotted with the beautiful lady who was not only his lover, but the only real friend he'd had since he was with his littermates. He was a loner by choice, but Chloe's charm had penetrated all his walls, and it made the affection he felt for her all the more special. Finally, Chloe could run no longer. Panting in the night air, she slowed to a trot and gazed after Storm as he skidded to a stop in front of her. Even now she could never quite keep pace with him, and she remained suspicious that he wasn't even running at full pelt. Despite this, Storm always said that Chloe had a grace about her in her every movement- something that he couldn't hope to pull off. He said that she was the most beautiful creature he'd ever seen, and Chloe couldn't help but be flattered. His tongue lolling out and tail wagging, Storm turned back to Chloe. \"D'you need to head home?\" \"The masters are out partying,\" Chloe replied, \"they're not going to notice me having some fun of my own. I'm just a little puffed, that's all.\" She rubbed her head against the underside of Storm's. Storm was a little relieved, and very grateful for the busy nightlife of Chloe's human masters. He knew where they should go now- the park, the place where they first met. Lying in the grass together, they'd be in their own world away from his street life and her apartment one. With a gentle nudge to his lover's side, he started on his way, taking an easy pace for Chloe's benefit. Out of the shadows, the figure of a dog cut in front of the pair. He was tall and scruffy, clearly, Chloe thought, a street dog like Storm. Immediately, she felt uneasy- there was something menacing about the stranger. \"Where are you two off to?\" the stranger asked, his eyes fixed on Chloe. Storm's hackles raised. He was aware that Chloe was coming into season, but he hadn't bet on getting unwanted attention from creeps like this. \"I don't see how it's any concern of yours,\" he growled. The stranger ignored Storm and moved closer to Chloe, trying to better take in her scent. She backed away, nervous. \"What's the matter, darling?\" the stranger asked, almost unblinking as he stared at the bitch. \"I can make you an offer too good to refuse…\" He moved in again, brushing up against Chloe. Snap! Storm sprang forward, clamping his jaws down on the stranger's neck. The strange dog spun around and struck back, leaving Chloe cowering in fear. In just a matter of seconds, a fight had erupted, and Chloe, miles out of her comfort zone, was stunned. It wasn't just the threatening stranger who was frightening her- it was Storm too. The flashing teeth, the fierceness in which he threw himself at the newcomer, the wildness in his eyes… it was something that Chloe had never before witnessed in him. Frozen on the spot, Chloe had no idea where to turn, what to do- her Storm truly was a street dog, a creature so different from herself. How had she not recognised it before? After a brief tussle, the stranger turned tail and ran, while Storm snapped at his heels. As he turned around, back toward Chloe, his fur flattened, the wild look in his eye faded, and his expression was once again gentle. He gave a whine of distress. Poor Chloe could have been in real danger… she seemed to have little sense of when to put on an aggressive front to defend herself. The stranger's intentions had been clear to him, but had Chloe an inkling of how to keep herself out of trouble? Storm wasn't so sure. She must have been so scared… \"Are you all right?\" he asked gently, and was hurt to see Chloe back away from him. Could she really believe, even for a moment, that he'd ever do her any harm? \"Honey, are you okay?\" he urged. The fight was completely absent in Storm's eyes, replaced by something different; upset, pleading, as if he was a pup begging for reassurance. Chloe couldn't believe she'd doubted him even for a second; he'd only done what was necessary to protect her. She relaxed her stance, and before she knew it, she was cuddled up to her mate and feeling a new security in his embrace. He was a street dog, and maybe she'd never quite understand the hardships he had to be prepared to face, but there was only goodness in him. Shaken by the encounter with the stranger, Chloe found herself crying into Storm's neck. \"I'm sorry I scared you,\" Storm whispered, \"I've just met enough dogs like that, sometimes they just don't know when to back off. I couldn't risk you getting hurt.\" Chloe shook her head, feeling foolish. She was exceptionally lucky to have someone as streetwise as Storm on her side. \"You don't need to apologise; I should be thanking you.\" To her relief, Storm's face broke into a smile, apparently reassured that he had her trust. She licked his muzzle and gazed into his dark eyes. \"If you still want to go to the park, I'd love to find a nice place- by the lake maybe- where we can snuggle down together. It's a beautiful night for it.\" Storm couldn't imagine anything he'd rather do. He reminded himself that Chloe was coming into season and that they'd have to be careful, but then to his assessment she was not ready yet anyway… a little romance would have no consequences. He wanted to be close to her, as she did him; together in the shelter of the trees and bushes, they could share their secret love with nothing and no one to fear. Storm woke the next morning back in the park, huddled beneath a leafy bush by the fence from which he could see Chloe and her master approaching. It was his favoured sleeping place for many nights now, for it meant he would be ready and waiting for meeting his mate as she took her morning outing. He stretched out, made himself comfortable, and quietly waited. The usual morning rush of off-leash dogs came and went, but there was no sign of Chloe. Disappointed, Storm got to his feet, shook himself and got on with his day. He wasn't too surprised; Chloe had been coming into season, and it would make sense for her humans to want to keep her in the security of the apartment. It would be likely that she wouldn't be much in the mood for spending time with Storm when night came either, but he'd drop by all the same, just to say hello and make sure she was feeling fine. That night, Storm found Chloe was indeed in season and feeling rather fragile. She sat and talked from the fire escape, but wasn't up for any adventures or romance. Storm was just happy to see that she was all right. With an expression of his affection for her and a gentle smile, he went back on his way. The next week or so was very much the same, and while Storm missed the fun he'd not long ago been sharing with Chloe, he still looked forward to the time he spent talking to her from outside the apartment, She'd not been feeling too good, so the meetings were becoming shorter, but he walked away each time full of affection and knowing that she loved him right back. But then things changed again. When Storm came to the apartment one night, his calls were unanswered, and Chloe never appeared to see him. It was certainly odd, but maybe she just feeling ill? Storm found himself looking forward even more to the time when Chloe's season would come to an end and things would return to normal. Weeks passed, however, and there was still no sign of her. Storm's calls grew more and more frantic, on several occasions leading him to be shooed away by human residents, but still Chloe was nowhere to be seen. Even has his distress intensified, Storm knew that he couldn't just give up- she loved him, she'd come out to see him sooner or later. Finally, one cool evening, Chloe was waiting at the fire escape when Storm turned the corner. His heart leapt and he ran forward, his tail wagging. But something in her expression was odd- she looked sad . Storm called her name and gave her the widest of grins, but even when Chloe smiled back, her eyes still looked miserable. Chloe gingerly jumped down from the fire escape, and looked into Storm's happy face, trying to find the right words. \"I've been so worried about you, Chloe!\" Storm exclaimed, taking in the sight of his beautiful mate. She looked as though she'd gained a bit of weight- probably because she'd been cooped up for weeks- but she was every bit as perfect to him as he'd remembered. \"You've not been really sick, have you?\" Chloe winced. There was no point in beating around the bush, it would only make things worse. \"Storm,\" she said quietly, \"Honey, I don't think we can do this anymore. I mean, we have to finish this now. We can't be together.\" Storm's face fell as he felt as if he'd been dealt a physical wallop. \"What? What are you talking about, Chloe? We're great together! We've gotten this far without anyone knowing, why should it be a problem now? I love you, you love me- what else matters?\" His pitch rose as the fear began to hit him. Why on earth could she suddenly pretend that she didn't want the love they'd shared? \"Storm- listen!\" Chloe demanded, despairing, hating to see the suffering in his face. \"I'm going to have puppies,\" she said, her tone softening, \" your puppies. I'm so sorry, Storm, we got it wrong.\" Storm blinked, stunned. This had to be a joke… a bad joke. Tears began to fill Chloe's eyes and she moved in to nuzzle her mate; she couldn't bear to leave him, but couldn't see another choice. What future would her pups have if it got out that they were the children of a stray? Storm was so much more than that, but Chloe knew that her humans would never understand. She felt physically sick as she remembered the look of shock on their faces. She wasn't meant to get pregnant, not like this. \"Storm, I'm sorry. I can't see you anymore, I just can't .\" \"But, but…\" Storm stammered, thunderstruck. How could this be happening? How could they have been so stupid, so naïve as to let this happen? \"I can be there for you- you and our puppies. I'm gonna love them just as much as I love you, I'll take care of them.\" Chloe shook her head. \"You can't. There isn't a choice, we've got to put them first. You know what humans think of strays! They'll have better chances of finding homes if no one ever knows about you. I'm not a street dog, and I never will be- and I can't let my puppies be either.\" Storm wanted to fight, to somehow convince Chloe that she had it wrong, but then she buried her face in his shoulder, crying. He tenderly nuzzled her, painfully aware that the comfort of her touch might very soon be just a memory to him. Chloe was hurting, and Storm couldn't bring himself to make it worse… but neither did he want to give up. Her tears subsiding, Chloe took in the scent of her mate- her former mate, and desperately searched her heart for another way out. The hard truth was, her being with Storm in the first place had been a terrible mistake. Her emotions had run away with her, her heart ruling her head and leading her into a mess she couldn't have imagined. She was now a burden to her humans, and in doing so had failed them as their dog. It was time to wake from the dream that she'd fallen into. She pulled away from Storm, and looked him in the eye. \"I don't want to see you again, we need to move on. It was never going to last, you know that.\" Chloe spoke with a finality that surprised even herself. Storm gave a heartfelt whine. \"I love you, Chloe, don't you get that? I know you love your humans, but you love me too- I know you do! Please, please, Chloe. Don't do this, please don't do this.\" As he spoke, Storm could feel his own immaturity coming through, he was on the verge of begging but it didn't matter. Chloe could hardly stand to see the misery in Storm's eyes. She knew that she'd have to walk away, the first step in taking care of the terrible mistake she'd made. But it hurt so much… \"I love you too, Stormie,\" Chloe had gently, her eyes filling with tears once more. \"But this has to finish now. I have to put the puppies first. I'll take care of them, honey, I promise- but I can't see you again. Don't come back here, it's hard enough already.\" For a long while they argued back and forth, Storm's desperation only serving to distress his pregnant lover who would dig her heels in further. She kept saying that she loved him, so why couldn't Chloe just forget about what her humans might think? Blinded by what she felt was best for the puppies, Chloe just couldn't be swayed. Admitting defeat, Storm slumped to the ground, feeling as though his heart was breaking. It really was over. Chloe turned to leave, unable to look back at Storm as guilt overcame her. \"Goodbye,\" she said quietly, \"I'll always love you, Storm, it's just gotta be this way. You keep yourself safe out here.\" Storm felt as if a heavy weight had been dropped on him. It really was over- Chloe couldn't even meet his eye. He watched as she walked away, finding himself frozen on the spot. \"Chloe!\" he called, but no response came. \" Chloe! \"[Chapter 4] His heart heavy, Storm took to aimlessly roaming the streets. He had little appetite, but managed to scrounge just enough to keep going. In the days since Chloe had delivered the crushing blow, he'd not gone near the apartment building, nor even the park where the two of them had played each morning; it was all too painful. Even as he couldn't bear to revisit the old places, Chloe was never out of his mind. Young and inexperienced as he was, Storm wasn't sure how long it would be before the puppies arrived- they could have been born already for all he knew. It hurt that he'd never have the opportunity to know them, but Chloe had been so certain that his presence would only cause the pups harm, and as their mother, Storm was respectful of her wishes. Respectful or not, Storm still longed to be with his family- and he found himself day-dreaming about the puppies that might have already entered the world. How many were there? Boys or girls? Did they look like him? Did they look like Chloe? Most importantly, he wondered if Chloe's beloved humans would care for the surprise puppies as he himself would have done. He hoped that Chloe would be happy; even if her choices hurt him, Storm could only wish her well. Storm dragged his feet as he walked, paying little attention to where he was. He couldn't be lost- he had nowhere in particular to go to anyhow. He was somewhere around Queens, somewhere new to him. There was a time when he'd have been full of curiosity and excitement at the thought of being somewhere new, but now he just didn't have the heart for adventures. He felt something from deep within him, something unfamiliar, not just sadness. Storm was taken by surprise when he realised that he was lonely. He hadn't been lonely since he was a small puppy, hoping for a bit of attention and affection from his humans. Chloe had changed him, made him yearn for companionship. As he finally acknowledged what he was feeling, Storm found himself overwhelmed with a strong urge to retreat back to where he'd come from- that little yard far from the city, the place he'd grown up in, the place where his humans had last seen him. At least going home would put some much-needed purpose back in his life. His mind set on a goal for the first time in weeks, Storm began his journey. His destination was just outside Margaretville and quite the trek away from the big city, but he'd come one way before, so he expected the return trip to be no problem. In the old familiarity of suburbia, he might finally be able to take his mind off the love he'd lost. Storm set a brisk pace, trotting steadily onwards. His stride was long and graceful, and seemingly tireless. He thought again and again about his puppies- going back through Manhattan it was hugely tempting to return to the apartment and call for Chloe just to give him one meeting, but Storm knew that walking away again would just be too painful. He sped up, not wanting to dwell too much on what might have been, and put his focus back on the destination. The houses slowly grew further apart, the streets greener, the roads less cluttered with cars, and Storm knew he was coming away from the city. Breathing in the fresher air, he found a spring come to his step, and his troubles seemed to gradually wash away as hour upon hour passed him by. Feeling more content as he was taken further away from memories of Chloe, he relaxed his pace a little, and stopped for many hours at a time to explore new neighbourhoods, investigate new scents, and even enjoy brief encounters with strange dogs. Storm realised that it wasn't really companionship he wanted after all, it had just been Chloe. With this in mind, it seemed the best thing he could do as he grieved the bond they'd once shared was to take an extended vacation from city life- he might stop by at his old place, but sitting alone in a yard could never make him happy, not really. Storm wandered into a grassy park, listening to the rhythmic squeaking of the playground swings as the chains moved with the breeze. It was dark now, and any children that might have been around had long since returned to their cosy homes. After turning in a circle several times, he lay down beneath a tree and sprawled out so he could look up to the sky. With the bright city lights now miles away, the expanse of the sky and the countless stars made quite a sight. Storm only wished he could share the peace and the beauty of this quiet spot with Chloe, he knew she'd have loved it. With a soft huff of sadness, he rolled back onto his belly. He'd heal from this, but he knew the longing he felt would not fade overnight. The summer reached its end, and then autumn rolled on, all the while Storm continued his slow journey back to his old home. He had only the vaguest sense of the route to take and took every opportunity to take a detour along the way, so his movements appeared aimless. He kept going back to the right direction, and he knew that it was important that he made it home sooner or later. Finally, after weeks of travelling, familiar scents reached Storm's nose, and he knew he was getting close. His heart skipped a beat as he recognised the street sign- he'd made it home! But as he ran toward the old house that drew him in with all the memories it held, something else made him skid to a stop. It has the happy sound of puppies squealing. Storm blinked, suddenly he was full of emotion and choked up. He couldn't help but move towards the source of the sound, his ears pricked with curiosity. He reared up, put his paws on the fence and peered over. Bounding around in the grass on the other side were five wriggling German shepherd puppies, each with a merrily wagging tail. Storm grinned at the sight. From the other side of the yard, a sharp bark rang out. \"Who are you?\" snapped the protective mother. Storm jumped in surprise, but didn't move from the fence. \"Sorry, I was just curious. I have pups myself.\" The words felt strange; he'd never even seen his own pups. \"You have a beautiful litter,\" he added politely. The mother relaxed a little, sensing quickly that there was no threat- at least while the fence was in place. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voice rather less forceful. They're my second, due to go to their new homes any day so I'm making the most of it.\" \"I bet that goodbye will be tough,\" said Storm as he watched the chubbiest pup gleefully chase his own tail. \"It's a wrench, yes,\" the mother said, \"but I trust my masters. They wouldn't let them go to anyone who didn't love them almost as much as I do.\" She fondly licked one of the pups who had flopped against her large paws, a look of great affection on her face. Though he said nothing, Storm couldn't help but wish that he'd had the chance to say goodbye to his pups, but he'd not even said 'hello'. From what he could tell by how the passing of the seasons mirrored that of his own puppyhood, the pups would not be so young now. More than likely, they'd all have been rehomed as pets, just as Chloe had wished. The thought gave Storm a heavy, compressing feeling in his chest. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'd better keep going. Sorry for intruding.\" \"I expect you want to get back to your babies,\" said the mother. \"Perhaps I'll see you around some time.\" It felt as though someone was tightening a heavy fist around Storm's chest. He silently nodded, and came back down onto all fours. Turning his head to look back down the street toward his old home, the desire to see the place had fizzled out. When he started the journey, he'd been certain that returning there would take him back to the way he felt when he decided to take his freedom. But now, there was no longing for adventure, he still just wished he could be with his mate and pups. There was only one place he should be, and that was by Chloe's side. It was time to turn around and go back. Chances are, it would be too late to meet the puppies, and it was true that Chloe didn't want him there, but he had to see her, even if it was just one more time. He had to know about his pups, who they were, and what had become of them all. Though he felt sick at the thought of feeling that terrible heartache all over again, he just had to know. With one last look back to his old home and his distant past as a pet- perhaps a pet that Chloe might not have been so ashamed of- Storm turned and began the long journey back to where he belonged. In contrast to his long and winding trek up into the state, Storm's journey home was relatively fast, largely due to his determination to see Chloe as soon as possible. It took about a week, but it felt like no time at all before he came to the metal fence and refreshing smells of greenery that told him he'd come back to his old haunt of Central Park. He hadn't been back here since the worst day of his life, and it was hard not to let emotions get the better of him. But he wasn't going to run away again. It was only fair that Chloe give him just a little bit of time to hear about his pups- she owed him that much. The final leg of his journey, the road to Chloe's apartment block, was laboured, and every few steps Storm's nerves would fail him and he had to stop to talk himself back into the meeting. Finally, the building was in sight. Storm could even make out the window that he knew marked Chloe's home. Gathering up all his courage, he barked and howled to announce his presence, but there was no response. Storm whined, unsure of what to do. Was she just ignoring him on purpose? Surely, she knew who it was calling? He called her name, yipped and barked, but still no sign of Chloe. Storm's frustration grew; it was more important to him than anything that he received confirmation that his pups were fine, but there was nothing he could do to get a response. After almost an hour, and many shouts from irritated human inhabitants, there was movement from Chloe's window at last. It was a human, apparently peering out to see what the noise was about, but it definitely wasn't one of Chloe's. Something's wrong , thought Storm. The confused hound waited a little while longer, but then admitted defeat and turned his attention to finding something to soothe his hunger and rumbling stomach. Once he'd eaten, Storm made his way back to Central Park and the spot where he and Chloe used to meet each day. She'd surely be there in the evening, once dogs were allowed free reign of the park- and if not, perhaps one of the other dogs would be able to assure him that all was well with her. When evening came and the park filled with free roaming dogs, Storm still could not find Chloe anywhere. It was odd; the masters always took her to the park at this time. Storm scanned the area for any familiar faces, and recognised a Dalmatian whom he knew enjoyed playing with Chloe. \"Hey!\" Storm called out, running in the direction of the other dog. \"Hey, you haven't seen Chloe round here? You know- the saluki. She would have had a litter of puppies a little while back.\" The Dalmatian wagged his tail, pleased to recognise Storm, a dog he'd not seen in a very long time. \"She's not been back here in weeks,\" he said. \"Her humans moved away with her, I guess they went too far to use the park like they used to. It's a bit of a shame really, she gave a wild game of chase! I think the pups had mostly gone off to new homes when they left. They were cute little devils!\" Again, Storm felt his chest constrict. Chloe was gone? He stuttered thanks to the Dalmatian before taking off at a run, urgently charging back to the apartment. His one hope of seeing his beloved mate again seemed to be going up in smoke, and he couldn't stand it. When he looked up to Chloe's window, he felt a sense from deep within him that she wasn't there anymore. Storm let out a howl of misery. When he finally pulled his attention away from the window, Storm was startled to see the thin figure of a dog at the corner of the street. For a few moments, his eyes met hers. The newcomer was small, obviously still a pup. Her eyes were bright and curious, and her face was framed by a mess of dark red-brown fur. She had Chloe's build and expression, but a certain wildness about her too. Obviously taking no chances with a much larger stranger, the puppy fled, leaving a stunned Storm in her wake. He almost couldn't believe what he'd just seen, but the striking resemblance left Storm certain; he'd just encountered one of his pups… and she was a street dog.[Chapter 5] Storm became totally fixated on the scrawny pup, so sure that she was indeed his daughter. He returned several times each day to the apartment building, knowing that the place would hold significance for her and that she'd be likely to return. And return she did. Several days after their first brief encounter, the puppy wandered across Storm's path again, and once more she bolted before he could say a thing. Another few days later, there she was again. Storm realised very quickly that it would be quite a challenge to put the flighty youngster at ease. No doubt she'd encountered many hostile strangers on the streets, and was not to know that he was not one of them. Every time he saw the child she was that little bit skinnier, that little bit more worn, and Storm wished he could reach out to her without causing her to run at first glance. And then one day, it all changed. Storm glanced around to see the pup standing behind him, obviously nervous, but standing firm, apparently curious. He gave her a small smile, then looked away, waiting for her to move first. When she continued to stand there, staring, he spoke. \"Hiya, squirt, you hang around here a lot don't ya?\" The pup, still looking nervous, nodded her head. \"I was born there, me and my brothers and sisters. They're all gone now though, Mom went away with her masters, and I was left behind. What about you? You're always hangin' around here too.\" Storm's heart skipped, knowing for sure that this really was his daughter. But what was she doing left all alone? Chloe wouldn't have left her own child alone on the streets- the very thought was ridiculous! He looked up to the window, full of confusion. What had happened for Chloe to abandon one of the puppies that had been so precious to her? Still gazing up wistfully, he answered his daughter. \"I used to know someone who lived there. A saluki, her name was Chloe. Most beautiful dog I ever saw,\" he said, before looking back to the pup, seeing once more the look of his beloved Chloe in her bright eyes. \"You're her kid, right?\" \"Yeah, yeah I am.\" \"Thought so, you look a lot like her. Right age too,\" said Storm, smiling nervously. How would she react to him? \"I knew she was pregnant, but I never saw her after that, I wondered what happened to the pups. I should have done something… said something. When I saw you round here, I thought you must be Chloe's daughter- my daughter. I didn't want to scare you; so I kept my distance. I actually don't usually stick around these parts, I was just passin' by, but then I saw you and a lot of memories come floodin' back. It's good to meet you, kid.\" The puppy's face broke into a broad smile. \"I've been looking around here for my sister. I don't know what happened to her when the humans moved on, I thought she mighta been dumped on the streets. You seen another pup like me round here?\" \"Sorry, little-un, I've not seen any other pups round these parts, certainly no sighthounds. So how'd you end up on the streets if you weren't ditched with your sister?\" The puppy looked down to her paws, the smile running from her face. \"I ran away. I had friends out on the streets, I went home with them. I left Willow. I never even thought to ask if she'd want to come with me, and now she's gone.\" Storm felt terrible for the puppy. None of this should have happened- he should have been there to make sure no child of his was left unwanted, to protect them. His mouth felt dry as he was overwhelmed with shame. His poor daughter had been shouldering a burden that was not rightly hers. \"I'm sorry to hear that, kid. You know, it's not your fault. These things happen- besides, you're just a pup, it's not your job to look after no one but yourself. That was your mother's job,\" he paused, \"and it was my job. I didn't think your mother would want me round you guys, but that's no excuse for not trying.\" \"Maybe we could look for Willow together?\" the pup asked hopefully, \"Even if she's not out there, at least we won't be alone. I hate being alone.\" Storm couldn't help but grin, this was more than he dared wish for after all this time. He didn't deserve it, but he might just have a second chance with this little one. \"You're welcome to tag along with me. Usually I prefer goin' solo, but I don't usually have my own daughter to keep me company. I think you and I have some lost time to make up.\" The two dogs travelled together, tails wagging, roaming the city streets in the cold winter air. Storm learned that this little slip of a pup went by the name of Rita, and that she was the sixth of a litter of seven. She had an interesting background; having run away to join a pair of street dog friends she'd made, leaving behind the younger Willow. After several weeks, the guilt-ridden pup had run away from the security of her playmates in order to try and find her sister. Storm had to admire the courage that she obviously possessed, and found himself wishing once more that he'd been there for her when things got tough. Rita had grown taller since Storm had first glimpsed her, but had also become ribby and sickly in appearance. She had the remnants of a large wound above her tail, and a tired look in her eyes. Despite all this, she looked genuinely happy, as though Storm's company had brought a new light into her life. Storm immediately felt a strong protectiveness towards her. Rita was his, and he would love her with everything he had. \"So, tell me about your brothers and sisters,\" prompted Storm, breaking a long spell of quiet- he never had been a talkative one. \"Most of them found homes, right?\" Rita looked at her feet miserably once more. \"Yeah, it was just Willow and me left. The rest of them went to homes,\" she said. \"Casey was the first one to be born and the last one to go. Honestly, I never liked her much, she was always kinda mean. Archer, Lola and Misty thought she was some sort of princess or something, they worshipped her, and left me and Willie out. They were all right though, we were just never that close. Charlie was good fun, I liked him a lot. Archer went to a home first- he was always really cuddly with humans, then Lola and Misty went together, then Charlie.\" \"I bet you miss them, hey?\" Storm asked. His imagination was going into overdrive- his mind swirling with images of what the other six pups might have looked like. Knowing their names, they seemed much more real to him now, not just a vague notion. He could still barely believe that he was actually talking to one of his and Chloe's children. \"I miss them a lot,\" said Rita with a heavy sigh. \"Even though we fought a lot, I still wish I could see them all again- even Casey. But I miss Willow most of all.\" She felt tears sting her eyes as the feeling of shame rose up in her once more. \"I loved her so much. She didn't want much to do with me near the end, but I always loved her. You'd love her too, she's a sweet kid.\" Storm gently nuzzled his daughter. \"Rita, you know there's next to no chance that we'll ever find her out her, right? I know it's tough, but you can't get your hopes up. You shouldn't have the burden on your shoulders anyhow, it belongs on mine.\" Rita nuzzled back and sniffed. \"I know that really. But it's really hard.\" \"It's gonna be hard, squirt, but I'm here for you now.\" The words warmed Rita's heart. She had felt alone for so long, and it had taken a heavy toll on her both physically and emotionally. In Storm she felt a new security, a trust that she couldn't explain. She missed her Willow, and she missed her street dog friends, Dodger and Einstein, but Rita found herself imagining a new life ahead of her with her father. For the first time in a long time, she had hope. That evening, Storm took Rita back to his familiar haunt, Central Park; the place where he'd first met her mother. He could feel Rita's relief to be surrounded by nature for a change, and he watched in contentment as she merrily danced through a grassy stretch. She bounded and leaped, she tumbled and somersaulted in the grass, she tripped over her gangly legs. Under the protection of her father, Rita could just be a puppy for a change, unencumbered by the need to be constantly on guard. Storm smiled as he watched her. She'd been dealt a rough hand in life, but her spirit was obvious. Rita was clearly a survivor, and Storm was already proud of her. \"Are you hungry, Dad?\" Rita asked cheerily as she stopped to inspect a discarded corndog. Storm's ears pricked. \"Good find, kid,\" he said, \"You have it all though. We've gotta put some meat on your bones.\" Suddenly Rita looked very embarrassed. \"I don't usually struggle so much. I'm actually really good at stealing stuff- Dodger taught me all the tricks. I've just been having some bad luck recently. Some dumb human gave me a thumping when he caught me in the act, and it made me more nervous. I'll come good again though,\" she said, \"I'm not gonna get beaten by this stupid winter.\" \"Don't worry about it, you're doing fine. It's not easy having to make a living on your own. You'll be back to your old self in no time.\" Storm was intrigued by what he'd heard about Rita's life with her old friends. Most street dogs were cautious of humans, avoiding them wherever possible, but it seemed that she'd been pushing the boundaries and using the city-goers to her advantage. He was interested indeed to see her in action sometime… perhaps there were things he could learn from this little pup. As the sky began to darken, taking with it the little warmth the sun provided, Storm set about finding a cosy place for the two of them to settle for the night. Rita was already shivering by the time he'd picked out a nice spot. Under the shelter of a tree, a big root caught his eye. Storm dug out- helped out by his daughter- the earth beneath the root and the base of the trunk, forming a little shelter. Satisfied with his creation, he crouched and crawled inside. Rita followed, drawn in by the warmth of her father's lean body. She flopped down on top of him, and snuggled in to his side. After a little bit of squirming and shifting, the two dogs lay comfortably side by side, their heads poking out and resting against the cold earth. The feeling of having someone pressed up against him to sleep was foreign to Storm- something he'd not experienced since he was with his littermates- but it made him happy. He closed his eyes. \"Dad?\" Rita whispered. Storm opened his eyes a little. \"Yes, squirt?\" \"Do you think my mom would be mad at me? She never wanted me to be a street dog.\" Even in the dark, Storm could see the earnest look on his daughter's face. \"Littl'un, your mom would be proud of you. You've been so brave,\" he said. \"You kids were everything to her; she only ever wanted to protect you.\" \"I miss her,\" said Rita sadly. \"I've not really said it; Dodger always hated it when I talked about my family to him, he said I should forget about the past. But I don't want to forget my mom- I wish I could see her again.\" It had been such a long time since Rita had felt the love of a parent, and being close to Storm brought home the weight of what she'd lost. She'd give just about anything to be able to feel the loving embrace of her mother just one more time, to be able to cry out all her hurt into her mother's shoulder. Just maybe, her newfound bond with Storm might fill the gaping hole that had formed in Rita's life. Storm whined sympathetically and tenderly licked Rita's cheek. \"I miss her too,\" he murmured, his voice cracking with emotion. He knew that his precious, scrawny child had been left with the same emptiness that he'd been suffering so long. But now, at least they had one another. \"If I knew where she was I…\" he faltered, feeling tears welling in his eyes. \"I'd take you to her if I knew how. I wish we could all be together.\" Storm moved his head so his cheek was by Rita's, and he closed his eyes. \"But I'm here for you now; it's the best I can do. It's you and me now, Miss Rita.\" Rita sniffed, but kept from crying. \"You can tell me,\" she said sleepily, \"about when you and Mom were friends, before she had us puppies. She never really said much, but I'd like to hear stories.\" She yawned. \"I will,\" said Storm, before echoing the pup's yawn. \"I can show you all our favourite places to play too- this part of the park is actually where we first met. And you can show me some of your favourite places, and maybe even teach me that mad car-hopping thing you do.\" Rita smiled a little, and closed her eyes, soothed by the contact with her father. The warmth he gave her allowed her to fall asleep more easily than she had in weeks, and soon she'd slipped into a deep slumber. \"Sweet dreams,\" Storm whispered. His heart ached with love for the gift that Chloe had left him. Rita was theirs, his , and now she was his whole world. He smiled as Rita twitched in her sleep, and then lay still, her face relaxed and content. The past couldn't be changed, but they'd found one another now, and their future was together. As he listened to the heavy breathing of his sleeping daughter, he knew that all his pain and suffering had not been in vain, for it had brought something so special into the world. Storm carefully lifted his head and gave Rita a soft kiss on her forehead and quietly spoke. \"I love you, my child.\"[Chapter 6] Sisters Reunited It had been fifteen long days since she'd gotten loose. The initial ecstasy that accompanied her freedom had long since vanished, and the hound was now aching and tired. Willow had experienced hunger before- that human had never cared to provide for her adequately, but this was different, exacerbated by the exhaustion from her travels. The thin, scruffy bitch collapsed on the ground. She'd lived in New York City all her life, but between the apartment of her puppyhood and the filthy yard in which she'd been chained for the past three years, she'd barely seen any of it. One could not exactly say that she was lost, Willow had nowhere in particular to go to anyway, but she was still struggling to get her bearings in the enormous, bustling city. There was nowhere peaceful. Her experiences had led Willow to fear and hate humans; she'd made her mind up never to be so naïve as to put her trust in one again- but here she found she could hardly get away from them, and the last time she attempted to move into less inhabited areas she'd gotten into trouble with canines of a far more threatening nature. Willow had not actually been on her own for the whole fifteen days, initially her companion, a Pit Bull mix, had travelled with her only to have been separated in the run in with that gang of dogs. The nervous and flighty Willow had bolted at the first sign of trouble, and was fast enough to get away without much difficulty, but Flash wasn't the sort for running from trouble, and Willow was certain that she'd have stood her ground. Willow shuddered, hoping that her friend had managed to get away safely. She felt a terrible shame in the knowledge that she'd fled rather than stand by the only person she could rely on. It had happened so quickly, there'd been no time to keep track of where Flash had gone. Willow whined as hunger lurched painfully in her stomach. There was no time to mope- she had to find something to eat, and fast. The sun was beginning to set and Willow began to head towards the docks, away from the glaring lights and unfriendly humans that lined the streets. She'd managed to scrounge a few pitiful scraps which at least took the edge off her aching hunger, and was now desperate to find somewhere she could rest comfortably. As she came across a seemingly deserted warehouse, Willow was overcome by the strong scent of dog. She raised her hackles as she realised that she was not alone. \"Hiya hot stuff,\" came a smug voice from behind her. Willow spun around, shaken. A mutt was standing there, leaning against a wooden crate, smirking. There was obviously a lot of terrier in him; he had rough, wiry fur in brown and grey patches against the white. Willow lifted her lip and uttered a low, rumbling growl. Her stomach had dropped at the sound of his voice, terrified of getting into another incident with savage street dogs. The arrogance in his voice, posture, expression put her on guard. She could not trust this stranger. \"Stay back,\" she growled, uncomfortably aware that she was backed against a wall with very limited means of escape. The stranger had caught her off guard, surprised and unprotected. Willow was, at least, larger than the terrier, which hopefully would be enough to put him off making an attack… unless there were others nearby, allies of his. Trying her very best to look harder than she really was, Willow, raised her lip in a snarl. \"Woah, woah, I'm not about to hurt a beautiful woman like you,\" he winked, still smug. \"Name's Dodger. You on your way to Murphy's, darlin'?\" Willow noticed the strange way he stared at her, almost as if there were some recognition there. \"I- I'm not going anywhere.\" She glanced around, trying to work out the easiest escape route if the strange mutt came closer. \"What is this 'Murphy's'?\" \"You're new around here, right? I'll show you 'round.\" Somehow there was even smugness in his walk. If she were not still so frightened, Willow might have been amused by the gall of this dog. She was just about to make a dash when she was stopped in her tracks by the voice of an approaching newcomer. \"Dodgie-baby!\" A female carried on towards them. \"Come on, we gotta get back, Fagin's gonna be missing us.\" She was around Willow's height, a mess of red-brown fur framing her face. Though thin and in obvious need of a proper grooming- though no more so than Willow was herself, the bitch looked relatively good health, and had a cool confidence about newcomer barely glanced at Willow, but Willow stared at her, scarcely able to believe what she was seeing. Then Willow remembered. Dodger . She'd heard that name before- suddenly it all made sense. \"Rita?\" she breathed. Caught off guard by the stranger's recognition, Rita looked at her properly for the first time. Her eyes widened as she saw her younger sister standing there- and there was no doubt that it was her, Rita would recognise that face, those soft eyes, anywhere. Stunned, she nodded. \"Will-\" she shook her head, wondering how this was even possible. \"Willow, how, how are you… how are you here?\" Getting over the initial surprise, Rita's eyes lit up in excitement and her tail began to wag. \"What, this is your sister? That Willow?\" Dodger asked, although he needed only to look at them to tell they were related. Willow was filled with relief at the sight of a familiar face, though she could not bring herself to lower her guard completely. Three years had passed, she could not honestly say that she really knew Rita anymore. Even when they'd last seen each other they'd not been on great terms, and Willow still felt resentment towards her sister for all that had happened when they were pups. For all Willow knew, Rita could be no better than the lowlifes she'd encountered earlier. \"I got out a couple weeks ago, I've been wandering the streets since then,\" said Willow. \"I can't believe you survived this long, it's a nightmare out here.\" \"So, you found a home?\" Rita was keen to hear what had happened to her younger sister. She'd feared for her a great deal since she'd seen her last. \"I don't think you could call it a home.\" Willow grimaced. \"But then, humans are scum, what would you expect? Anyhow, I don't want to talk about it. I just want to find somewhere to sleep where I can actually get some peace.\" She looked questioningly at Rita, desperately hoping for some help. \"You're not gonna want to come home with us then, we've got a human.\" Rita sighed. \"A human? Aren't you street dogs?\" Willow was surprised, and her heart dropped as she realised she couldn't take refuge in Rita's home. \"He's a street human,\" said Dodger. \"He's harmless, and he'll be happy to provide you with biscuits and a roof over your head, but yeah, still human.\" Rita turned to Dodger. \"Dodge, do you wanna head home? I'll stay and sort Willow out.\" \"Sure,\" Dodger replied, and turned to head off. \"I'll see ya later then.\" Willow watched after him as he left. \"Is your mutt always this full of himself?\" Rita cracked up laughing. \"You have no idea. Honestly, he's a good guy; he's the smartest dog I know- but yeah, he's got a big ego on him.\" \"Do women actually get taken in by that ridiculous flirting?\" \"All the time, and obviously that only makes him worse.\" Rita rolled her eyes. Willow managed to crack a half smile. \"If you don't want to be around any humans, you're probably best stopping at Murphy's place. You see that warehouse over there? Loads of dogs go there to sleep or just to hang out. It's real friendly, dogs just come and go and there are never any issues. No humans either. Murphy likes them about as much as you do.\" Rita said, and started towards the building with Willow close behind her. She noticed the nervousness in Willow's face. \"If you want to be left alone, they'll leave you be. But you'll be safer in there than out here by yourself.\" Willow nodded, still unsure, but really she could not see a better option. As they reached the entrance, her hackles raised defensively. A large, shaggy grey-brown dog greeted them at the doorway. \"Hi, Murphy, Willow here is in need of a safe place to rest.\" She motioned towards her sister with a shake of her head. \"If you could help her find somewhere quiet, without too many other dogs-\" \"No problem, Rita.\" Murphy said in a gruff voice, and then turned to Willow who was crouching submissively. \"You're not wanting to take your chances with their human I take it?\" he scoffed. \"A wise choice, most of us round here disassociate ourselves with humans for good reason. Don't worry, I'll find you a quiet place.\" Nervously, Willow followed Murphy in, past several small parties of dogs who were animatedly chattering amongst themselves. \"I'll be back round here tomorrow. See ya, Willow!\" Rita called out, and went on her way. Willow had looked very unsure, but Rita knew that the dogs in charge of the warehouse would make sure she was well taken care of, at very least until they could work out what to do. Murphy led a still hunched and submissive Willow to a quiet corner, away from the hustle and bustle of the other residents. The skinny hound lay down onto a pile of raggedly cushions. \"Thank you.\" She was still not entirely sure about this Murphy character, but she was grateful for the comfortable place to bed down; it was more than she could have hoped for just a few hours ago and a colossal improvement over the muddy yard from which she'd come. After Murphy left, she laid her head down and closed her eyes. She tried not to concentrate on the strong smell of strange dogs that hung in the air. Willow was stunned by the turn of events- she'd hardly given a second thought to Rita since she ran away, the chances of finding her in a city of this size were so low it was crazy, but still there she was. Willow supposed that Rita seemed nice enough, not that she had much to go on. Still, this was the same person who'd left Willow to be thrown in the pound with not so much as a second thought, just so she could run off with that stupid, smug little mutt. Willow could not lie awake thinking for long, exhaustion quickly overcame her and within two minutes she was fast asleep. Rita wandered home rather aimlessly, trying to wrap her head around what had just taken place. It almost felt as though it must be a dream, it just didn't seem that it was possible for this to happen, not after all the time that had passed. She'd assumed Willow to be dead- with no home to go to, the timid pup would have been either dumped on the streets or sent to the pound three years ago. It was an indescribable relief to know that Willow was safe; Rita had been plagued with guilt after realising that she could have prevented all that had she not been so caught up in her own little world with Dodger, but this meant that she'd have to actually confront it at some point. Could Willow really forgive after all she'd been through because of Rita? There was no choice but to try make things right- and Rita so wanted back the bond she'd once shared with the beloved little sister she'd once snuggled up to each night and protected from bullying siblings. The tantalising thought distracted Rita from what should have been a quick journey home, but suddenly she that the skies were now getting very dark. The draw to be back with the gang in the rickety, yet homely old barge kicked in, and she sped up, slipping through the shadows that hung around the dockyards. Three-month-old Willow lay on her belly, staring into space. The humans had been packing their countless belongings away into boxes for several days, and by now only the essentials remained out. The pup felt ill, knowing that she would not be among the 'essentials' that would make the trip to the new place. It must be coming, it must be soon. Her mother had been crying all morning, and had spent a great deal of time cuddling her youngest daughter, trying hopelessly to provide comfort as she prepared to face the worst. Rita had already left, so early in the morning that Willow didn't even see her. It wasn't an unusual occurrence. Willow had seen less and less of her remaining littermate in recent weeks; Rita spent most days off gallivanting on the streets, and the pair barely spoke when they were together. It was a change to the close bond they'd once shared. Rita had once been Willow's protector, the toughest pup in the litter taking care of the most vulnerable, but they drifted apart. No longer needed, Rita found comfort elsewhere. Lost in her thoughts as she lay there, Willow wondered if it was her own fault that she'd lost her friend and sister. Still, there was no reason for Rita to be so cold, sneaking out early so she wouldn't have to see her each morning. Willow was too distracted to notice the footsteps coming up behind her, and she was taken by surprise as a pair of strong arms scooped her up and carried her to the door. The pup realised with a horrifying jolt that this was it. It was all over. She squirmed and whimpered helplessly. \"Mom! Mommy!\" The saluki rushed into the room, her hackles raised and barking angrily. She could not bring herself to physically harm her human, but by no means would she stand quietly and let him take her baby to her death. \" Grab hold of Chloe, will you?\" the man shouted, and within moments his partner was shoving the saluki out of the room. \" Willow! No- Willow!\" Chloe cried out, but the man was already closing the door, and taking her precious child with him. Willow was shaking, her breathing fast and shallow. She was terrified, not knowing what was to come, but sure she was in big trouble. She closed her eyes and allowed the man to place her on the back seat of the car. They drove off, and Willow knew that she had lost forever her mother, her sister, and the only home she had ever known. They pulled up at a grey-walled building. The looming walls gave the pup a bad feeling, as did the faint sounds of distressed dogs that came from within. This was the pound. Willow felt tears welling up in her eyes. She wanted her mother, just to hold her, to tell her everything would be OK. She was walked to a cage, and went in without a struggle. What would struggling do anyway? She flinched as the metal door clanged shut behind her, and looked up pleadingly at the master for one last time. It was all for nought. Finally, after weeks of dreading it, she was alone in the pound. Willow had no future. Memories of her distant past plagued Willow through the night, stirred up by the appearance of her sister. She'd tossed and turned, but despite the weariness she felt all over, it took her several hours before she could switch her troubled thoughts off enough to drift to sleep. It was the middle of the day by the time she awoke. The quiet space in the corner of the dark room felt secure and comforting, and she was not keen to get up and explore, even by late afternoon. Rita had said that she'd be round sometime, but Willow couldn't know how long she'd be waiting around for her. She struggled to get her head around her feelings towards her sister, she'd built up a resentment towards Rita in the years she'd been chained in that yard, but right now she was the only person to turn to. Her stomach growled painfully and she whined in hunger. She wondered how long she could carry on living off tiny scraps- and even they had been few and far between. After several hours, Willow got to her feet and cautiously walked through to the main room where dogs were gathered, finally tired of waiting. She avoided eye contact with the many strangers as she passed through, with just a nod of acknowledgement to the shaggy mutt, Murphy, who apparently ran the place. \"You sleep okay, Willow?\" Murphy barked after her. Willow nodded again, turning back to the mutt. \"Fine, thank you. I appreciate your hospitality.\" She smiled politely, but was still not completely sure of him. It occurred to Willow that it would take rather a lot for her to be completely sure of anyone. \"Has Rita been by?\" \"Sorry, no. Give her some time, I expect she's tied up working for her human.\" Murphy sighed, \"Why though, is beyond me. She'll be round eventually, just hang around here.\" Willow paced around the warehouse for some time more, feeling uncomfortable as some of the strange dogs tried to greet her. Each time she'd flinch away, scared. Finally she spotted Rita approaching, and trotted over, relieved to have that bit of familiarity to cling to. \"Hey Willie, you doin' okay?\" Rita greeted her sister cheerfully, covering up the anxiety she felt over the situation. It was bizarre to hear herself called that after so much time, in an instant Willow was taken back to her puppyhood. The feeling was bittersweet, and complimented her conflicted emotions towards Rita. Willow nodded, \"It's a roof over my head, I can't really complain.\" Admittedly it was better than huddling up in some cold alleyway, but she wondered if this was as good as it would ever get for her, and that was painful. Rita looked at her sister, sadness bubbling up inside her. Years ago she'd have given anything to have found Willow, to take her back to live with Fagin, where she would be safe and loved. It was simply too late for that now, Willow was damaged and mistrustful. For a little while the two of them walked in silence, heading out into the streets. Neither knew quite what to say to the other, unsure of how their rekindled relationship would play out if they tried to make contact. Finally, Rita spoke, knowing that Willow had to be made to understand the situation that she was in, \"Look Willow, things have been pretty hard back home recently, we're under a lot of pressure right now. I'll do all I can to help you, but my family needs me too; things are gettin' pretty desperate.\" Her words struck a nerve in Willow, \"Your family? I'm your family! You are all that I have right now, but you'd still put some lowlife street dog before me? You know what, Rita, you disgust me.\" It all came out too quickly, fuelled by exhaustion and the ache of the years she'd suffered, and in an instant she realised that her best chance for a brighter future had been blown. Rita's expression hardened in fury. She'd thought of Willow as the same sweet, shy little dog that she'd been as a pup, but in that moment it dawned on her that she was actually dealing with someone very different. \"You want to look in the mirror, honey; lowlife street dog is what you are now. I've not seen you in three years and you expect me to just drop everyone who's actually been there for me all this time? I'm tellin' you now, I don't owe you nothin'. If you want my help, you got it, but I will not let my real family down just to stroke your ego.\" Willow glared at Rita, her head lowered. She didn't see any option other than to accept whatever help Rita could offer. The old wounds from her puppyhood had been reopened as Willow came to understand that nothing had changed, Rita's loyalty was with Dodger and everything else could just fall to pieces. Like she had. An anger rose up inside her and she felt a strong urge to lash out, to physically hurt the person who had, for all intents and purposes, destroyed the young Willow's life through her self-centredness. Willow bared her teeth. By now Rita's hackles were up and she stared her sister down. This wasn't going at all how she'd hoped it would. \"You really want to try it, sis? I'll fight you if it makes you feel better, but I can guarantee that you will come off worse.\" Willow wasn't stupid. Rita had always been much tougher than she was, and since then she'd spent years on the streets fighting to survive; as much as Willow wanted to inflict just an inkling of the pain she'd endured, she knew it would simply not be happening. She growled but relaxed her stance. \"What help can you give me? I will never have a home with you- nor that arrogant mutt.\" Rita shook her head. \"I can help you find food, show you all the best places to look and all that, but I can't stay with you. I'm sorry Will, I just can't.\" It was a crushing blow to Willow as she had to accept that her aching loneliness would be going nowhere. As quickly as it had come, the rage had dissipated, overshadowed by a terrible sadness. Willow found her eyes welling up, the storm of emotions threatening to get the better of her. It was all too much. She looked away defiantly. Rita instantly regretted losing her temper; it wasn't as if it was Willow's fault she ended up like this. She took a deep breath and allowed herself to regain her cool. \"I've got work to do, and I've really got to put that first. Hopefully things will get better soon, but for now that's just the way it's gotta be. Anyway, I want you to come along with me tomorrow. You don't have to go near Dodger, or my human, or anyone else if you don't want to. I'll show you all you need to know to get by, and we can keep doing it every day until you find your feet.\" Finally, Willow nodded. Any help to find food could not be turned down, even if the offer came from someone she could barely stand to look at. It seemed Willow was just going to have to learn to deal with the lonely nights… as much as she near despised Rita, there was still that long-held desire the snuggle beside her, just as they'd always done so long ago. \"Come on, I'll get you something to eat.\" Rita smiled gently, hoping she could do something to repair their broken relationship. She set off, glancing behind to encourage Willow to follow. There was no doubt about it, this wasn't going to be easy for either of them.[Chapter 7] Once again, it was late by the time Rita got home. Despite Willow's apparent dislike for her, Rita was still all that her sister had and it was hard to leave with the vulnerable dog urging her to stay. Willow just wouldn't give up, but neither would she trust Rita enough to join her as she went back to the barge. It was a wrench to walk away, but Rita reminded herself that Willow wasn't the only person who needed her, and by no means would she let her family down. She quietly came down the stairs; it seemed everyone was asleep. \"Been with your baby sis all this time?\" Dodger asked with a yawn. He had not yet gone into a deep sleep and was easily woken by the sound of Rita on the stairs. Rita sat down beside Dodger's bed, pleased to have some friendlier company. She sighed heavily as she started, \"Yeah, it's been pretty rough. She's made it clear that she hates me, but still she wants me with her all the time. I'm not sure if she's just really lonely or if she's tryin' to punish me.\" \"Weird girl,\" he said, \"I didn't get the impression she was much keen on me either. Must be somethin' wrong with her.\" \"Oh, she definitely doesn't think much of you.\" \"Guess I'll have to try harder to win her over,\" Dodger grinned slyly. \"Don't you even think about it! The last thing I need is you winding her up. She's off limits. There must be some women left in the city for you to come on to who aren't my sister.\" Rita growled, not prepared to take any of Dodger's nonsense. Dodger readjusted himself, trying to get comfortable. \"S'ppose it's not worth my trouble anyhow. Sure, she's easy on the eyes, but if I'm into that sort of thing I've got you right here. Kinda similar looking but with a sense of humour.\" Rita shook her head and made to go to bed. It was clear that Dodger wasn't going to be much help. \"Hey, Rita,\" he called after her, and nipped at her tail, \"You are okay, right?\" She turned around, noticing a concerned look on his face. \"I'm fine. Or I will be. I just thought I'd gotten over all this, moved on.\" She lay down and pulled her blanket haphazardly over herself. \"You don't think Storm would want to help? Take the pressure off a bit.\" Dodger suggested. Rita's father had spent a great deal of time with her when she was younger, and still maintained occasional friendly contact. It seemed a fair assumption that he would be equally interested in another of his daughters. Rita shook her head. \"I'm sure he would, but I've not seen him in months. He could be anywhere. And I wouldn't bet on Willow being receptive either.\" She yawned, which brought on Dodger doing the same. Dodger laid his head down on a cushion, ready to call it a night. \"Don't let her get to you, okay?\" he said sleepily. \"Thanks, honey. I'll try.\" Willow huddled in the back of her cage, shaking with fear. There were dogs either side of her, scratching at their cage doors, whining, howling. The voices of countless strangers as they pleaded for their freedom crashed over her, and it was all too much. She cried, and cried, until she could barely squeeze out another tear. Her worst nightmare had come true, and all she could do was to wait to be given the needle that would finally liberate her from her heartache. For several days she did very little, too frightened to try and interact with any of the other dogs, too glum to eat more than a few bites of food each day. From what she had overheard, many of the dogs held up hope of being adopted. Willow knew better than to put faith in such a dream; the whole reason she was in that awful place was that no one wanted to take her home. She just lay there and tried to escape in her thoughts. She thought of her mother- the loving presence that had surrounded her from the very beginning, trying to protect her from the inevitable. Her mother had at least tried to stop her from being taken away. It should have been more, though. Even maternal love was apparently not enough to bring Chloe to betray her human masters. Never would she risk being disposed of herself, even if it meant her own pup would be met with that fate. Willow thought of Rita. She felt a cold resentment as she imagined her sister living a carefree life with her street dog friends. Rita had never invited her to join them, to have a chance of a future, even if it did mean falling in with the wrong crowd. It had to be better than this. A couple stood by her cage door, talking animatedly to one another. Willow tried to block out the chatter; she had enough to wallow in without being the source of amusement for humans. But then they opened the door. Willow's head shot up as the thought she'd not allowed in came rushing to her. Could she really get adopted? Was that what these people wanted? The woman crouched down and held out her hand. Willow was unsure of the situation, but approached all the same, sniffing at the woman's hand. Both the humans were smiling. Willow felt her heart leap… this looked promising. She could scarcely believe it. \" Do you think she's the one?\" the man asked. \" She's the one,\" came the reply. Thinking back to her puppyhood was painful for Willow, but as she was still loathe to interact with other dogs in the hangout, there was little else to do to pass the time. If only her old friend, Flash, were here; really she was the only true friend that Willow ever had. But poor old Flash had almost certainly been torn apart by those savage dogs. The thought discouraged the lonely hound further from making contact with the street dogs that surrounded her. Considering how much she'd once longed to leave her old yard, Willow was disappointed that the grass really did not seem to be greener on the other side at all. She was still hungry, she'd lost her only friend, and was now relying on someone she resented. She was beginning to think that maybe she shouldn't have left at all. It was morning, and Willow was expecting Rita to be around to see her anytime. Her sister may not have been her first choice for an ally, but at least she knew what she was doing. Willow left the warehouse to get some fresh air before she met up with Rita. Rita swallowed her nerves as she approached the old warehouse. Her previous encounter with her sister had not exactly gone smoothly, and she was hoping that things would go better. It was still hard to believe that Willow was even there at all, and it was a lot for Rita to get her head around after believing her to be dead for so long. She spotted Willow a short distance away and called out to her. \"Morning, Will! You ready to get goin'?\" Willow smiled falsely. If Rita was at least trying to help, then she would try and keep things friendly. \"I'm ready. The sooner I can learn to take care of myself properly, the better.\" It had already been established the previous day that Willow would be keeping as much of a distance between herself and humans as was possible, which could be a challenge in a city teeming with people. Rita took Willow around quiet alleys, showing her the best routes to take and the most reliable places to find food. She didn't even bother trying to show her sister the fine art of pick pocketing, Willow had already made her views on thievery quite clear when she saw what Rita's 'work' involved. Going through trash to look for scraps would be Willow's best bet. The sky was an ominous grey, and Rita was eager to feed Willow up at least a little bit before the rain came. Unfortunately, Willow was every bit as uncooperative as she'd been the day before. \"All right, how about I show you how to catch rats? You should be able to find plenty of them, and not have to get so close to humans.\" Rita suggested, after they'd been through yet another disappointing bag of rubbish. If Willow was kept occupied, it would free her up to try and find some good loot for Fagin- the situation back home was only getting worse, and Rita knew that she needed to find a way to help out and take care of her sister. The timing of Willow's appearance certainly hadn't been ideal. \"I caught a few rats that wandered into the old yard,\" Willow said proudly, \"You show me where to look and I'll get hunting.\" \"With enough practice, you'll probably be able to take out birds as well. Those fat pigeons don't move so fast, should be easy enough,\" Rita grinned, feeling that she'd hit the solution to her sister's food problem. \"As for finding them; if you're quiet enough, you can find them in just about every alley. They like the damp, so you'll find plenty round the docks. An easy meal if you're not wanting to stray too far from the warehouse. If you stick around these parts for a while, I'll come back for you a while later, make sure you're doing all right.\" \"What? So you're free to indulge in your favourite criminal pastime?\" Willow sneered. She felt a couple of drops of rain on her muzzle. Rita didn't rise to her sister's taunt. She was proud, but she wouldn't allow herself to be drawn into another argument. \"Unfortunately, Fagin won't eat rats, so I'm just gonna have to help him out the way I'm good at. If you don't have any more complaints, I'll leave you to it.\" Willow turned to go down the nearest alleyway, taking care with each footstep. She'd not considered rats as a source of food until that point; she'd seen surprisingly few of them since getting loose, and when she had, she'd been more concerned with making sure she got to any scraps of food before they did. She felt silly now, it wasn't as if she'd never caught a rat before. It was really raining now. Willow ignored the steady fall of raindrops and focused on a scratching behind a trashcan. She approached quietly, listening intently. The rat hadn't heard her, probably her footsteps were drowned out by the rain against the metal bin. This was too easy. With one quick movement, she knocked the bin aside and took the rodent in her jaws. It was over before the poor rat knew what had hit it. A short way away, Rita was not enjoying the same luck. The rain was getting heavier, and the humans who had not ducked indoors somewhere for cover were hurrying around, their possessions held close for protection from the wet. It was hardly ideal conditions for stealing. After a while, she grew frustrated and gave up. There was nothing for it but to go back to searching through trash, which never brought quite the same results. Dripping wet, Rita ran back the way she'd come, hoping to find Willow. It took only a few minutes to run into her, the scruffy hound was huddled under the edge of a roof, a partly eaten rat at her feet. \"Bad day for stealing?\" Willow smirked. She felt a great satisfaction in knowing she'd achieved more than her sister, it showed just how pointless an exercise it was to put all your energy into helping out some stupid human. Rita shook herself as she reached the slightly drier area in which Willow was waiting. \"Just gonna have to wait until this clears up a bit.\" She avoided eye contact with her sister, who was obviously still wanting to get a rise out of her, and stared out into the rain. Bad weather or not, she'd have to find something to bring back. With six mouths to feed, any rough patches they went through were felt by all. Fagin would always buy dog food before he'd feed himself, and he was getting into a poor state as a result. Rita couldn't allow herself to let him down. Willow might mock, but what did she know? She didn't understand how it felt to have the ones she cared about depending on her, all she did was demand more for herself. Rita shivered, the wet getting to her. \"I hate the rain,\" Willow said as she joined Rita in looking out at the downpour, \"There was hardly any shelter in the old yard. Flash and me used to get soaked.\" \"I'm sorry you lost your friend, you must really miss her.\" Rita murmured. Flash had only been mentioned very briefly, it seemed something that Willow didn't enjoy talking about. It was small wonder Willow seemed desperate for love now, even if it was only coming from the person she'd least like to have to take it from. Rita felt a great pity for her sister rise up in her. Her poor little Willow… Willow looked down, determined not to cry. \"She was all I had. We were so happy to escape, but now I'm wondering if we should've just stayed put. It was terrible back there, you wouldn't believe it,\" she shook her head, \"But we had each other. Now, it's just me. Just me and a world I'm not made for.\" \"I know it's hard, really I do. The learning curve's gonna be a steep one, it always is. But if you give it some time things won't look so bad. It's all up to you now- you've got most of your life ahead of you, and you've got the freedom to do what you want with it. I'll help you as much as I can, but unfortunately the really tough part is down to you.\" Rita wanted to snuggle close to her little sister, to comfort her. The protective feelings she'd felt for Willow when they were little were still there, finally rekindled after all this time. But every time she made to move closer, Willow would flinch and lean away. Willow wondered what kind of a future she could possibly have. A part of her wanted to mend the bond she'd once had with Rita, but it seemed pretty pointless when it would always be trumped by Rita's loyalty to her human and that stupid, arrogant mutt. Maybe she would be better off alone. Relying on only herself to get by, she'd have little to fear from humans or other dogs- she was fast enough to keep out of harm's way. It would just be the loneliness… the thing that she truly couldn't stand. Willow knew that it was all hopeless. She looked down at the rat. Perhaps she would feel better if she made an effort with Rita. It didn't mean she'd have to accept any of her good for nothing friends. She nudged the rat towards her sister. \"If you're hungry, you can take some of this.\" Rita was surprised, and smiled. \"Thanks, but I'll find something later. You need to take care of yourself right now.\" In spite of everything, Willow felt a little better. She had enough to deal with without fighting with the only person who she had to rely on. It wasn't ideal, but it was something. Maybe they could move forward. Just perhaps in baby steps.[Chapter 8] A home at last! Little Willow could scarcely believe it, after believing for so long that she'd be losing her life at the pound. The humans, her new humans, talked excitedly all the way to the new place, as if they were as happy to have her as she was to be going home with them. Willow's new home wasn't anything fancy, but it was a roof over her head, food in her bowl, and cuddles whenever she needed, and by her standards, that was quite enough. She lay on their bed each night, joined them for long walks in the park, and played tug-of-war and fetch in their lounge room. It was a good life, everything she'd ever hoped for. But then something changed. Willow wasn't sure at first what had happened. The humans were excited one night, much more so than they'd been when they'd brought Willow home, crying and hugging one another. Good news? It seemed that way, but then their interest in Willow waned, and every now and then she'd see something that looked like guilt in the way they looked at her. Then the pup caught that dreaded word… 're-homed'. For a little while longer, Willow told herself that she was imagining it, that her humans could never let her go, but it wasn't to be. When they arrived at the new place, the master handed Willow's leash to a new man who led her out to the backyard. The puppy trembled, the feeling of home that she'd felt when she arrived at the last place was not coming here. The yard was muddy and littered with mess, another dog was chained to the sole tree that stood there. The dog, a stout female with a strong look of Pit Bull about her, eyed the newcomer, her stance proud and dominant. Willow soon found herself chained up, tied to a pole that held up the back veranda. To her, 'tied up' had always been a punishment, and she wondered what on earth she'd done wrong to deserve this. As the human turned to leave her, she cried, and cried, and cried. Occasionally, the other dog, who went by the name of Flash, would speak to her, trying to give her some comfort. While initially Willow had been very nervous of the stranger, she realised quickly that Flash had only good intentions and that in her she might find a much-needed friend. It came to be that Willow depended greatly on her new friend, Flash. The human was barely around, and when he did it was only to shout profanities at the dogs for their barking, which would occasionally be accompanied by throwing whatever he had at hand at one on the unfortunate canines. While Willow whimpered and cried whenever the human's rage got the better of him, Flash stood firm, refusing to submit to the horrible man. She always made the effort to keep Willow's spirits up, and although her chain prevented physical contact, they formed a close bond with each providing a desperately needed source of love to the other. Willow paced back and forth outside the warehouse. Rita should have been there by now, morning was long since over. It didn't take much for her to guess where she'd got to- Rita would be with Dodger as she always seemed to be. Willow's own social life was still very poor as she made as little contact as possible with the many dogs who came and went from the old warehouse. There were a few regulars, and a few who, like her, seemed to live there permanently, but recognition alone was not enough to convince her to try and make acquaintances. It was a trifle lonely, but the promise of Rita's company gave Willow the focus to get through it. At least she knew that her sister wasn't dangerous, which was more than she could say for strange street dogs. Being used to long days and nights in a squalid yard, the boredom of sitting around in her own company was not too much of a hardship, and she kept herself well fed by hunting for rats when Rita not around. Willow even had a few attempts at taking down pigeons as Rita had suggested, with varied success. She'd already eaten today whilst she'd been waiting, what with Rita obviously in no hurry to make an appearance. The dry spell that the gang had been going through continued, and they were getting by on the bare minimum of food to eat. The pressure was on, leaving everyone ratty and getting on one another's nerves. Fagin was extremely stressed and was getting into terrible shape as he always made sure the dogs ate before he did, despite all the attempts made to help him look after himself. Rita struggled to keep her mind off Willow and was bringing even less home each day as a result, which had not gone unnoticed. Dodger managed to rope her into sticking around to get some work done with the rest of the gang, despite Rita's reluctance to let Willow down. She knew that it would do nothing to improve her sister's opinion of her, but if her family were struggling then they simply had to come first. No matter what she did she'd only feel guilty, there was just no winning. Rita trotted back to the scooter with a pair of old socks in her jaws, which she placed next to the broken doll she found earlier in the trolley. She frowned as she looked down on the fruits of her labour; none of it would be worth anything, and so would do nothing to keep them all fed. At least Fagin could make use of the socks. Despite the horrible feeling that she had failed her master and her friends, Rita knew that she had to get back to Willow, and continue working with the hindrance of a whiny little sister in tow. \"Headin' off so soon, Rita?\" Dodger called, strutting over with a wristwatch dangling from his mouth. He dropped it in with the rest of the rubbish. \"Anyone would think you just don't like us anymore.\" \"Don't start on me again, you know I don't have a choice,\" Rita said, \"She doesn't have anyone else.\" \"Pity there's no one to look out for her who doesn't already have family they're supposed to be lookin' after. There must be no one at all at the warehouse who could keep her company.\" Rita glowered at him. \"She doesn't want to talk to the others. Besides, she's family. I should be taking care of her.\" Angrily, she turned to leave. Dodger just didn't get it. Dodger followed, knowing full well that Rita would listen to him so he'd let her slip away to see Willow. \"This is all about you making yourself feel better. Tryin' to lose all that guilt you had over her. You said it yourself; she doesn't even like you. And it's not been doing you any good either, you've been miserable since you found her. It's not worth it, Rita. You're not doing yourself any favours, or Willow, or the rest of us.\" Still not looking his way, Rita knew that Dodger understood far more than she'd have liked him to. She had so desperately wanted to make up for everything that went wrong when they were young, but it seemed that there was only so much she could do… and nothing could ever change the past anyway. \"You're just sore because you're not the centre of my attention for a change.\" \"Whatever my motivation, I'm right and you know it.\" \"How can I just walk away, Dodge?\" she looked to him, searching for support, \"I know this isn't working, but deserting her all over again won't help either.\" \"Taking a step back doesn't mean you're leaving her. You know how tough things are gettin', Rit. We need you, Fagin needs you. And you gotta take care of yourself, I don't want to see you hurtin' yourself over her.\" With a heavy heart, Rita conceded that something had to give; she simply couldn't fix everything that had gone wrong for Willow, and if her little sister was to have a future, it just couldn't be with her. \"I'll see you later, Dodgie. I'll try not to be too late.\" Dodger let her go, hoping that just a little bit of what he said had got through to her. Willow watched as her sister approached, finally after hours of waiting. \"Let me guess; you're going through a rough patch and you needed to stick around with your 'family' because they 'needed' you. Right?\" she growled. Rita steeled herself. She knew that this was not going to be easy. \"Hi Willie. We gotta sort you out with some friends, or even just acquaintances- it doesn't matter, but you need someone. I can't be with you all the time, and if you want to make it as a street dog you're going to want some more support.\" \"You said you'd help me,\" Willow spat. She hadn't been waiting around all day just to be brushed off. It had seemed that she'd been getting somewhere with Rita, but that was all a mistake. \"I'm not just dropping you. But face it, it's not doing you any good to be relying on me. You need to move forward with your life, not keep going over the distant past over and over. If you want me to really help you, you're going to have to trust me.\" Even as she spoke, Rita had her doubts, but she couldn't see a better way. \"Just give this a try, and if it works, it works. And if not… I'm not going to just leave you all alone.\" Willow considered the situation and then nodded. She had no desire to make contact with the dogs who hung around the warehouse, but had to assume that Rita knew what she was doing. With trepidation, she walked back to the dark old building a few steps behind Rita. Several other dogs looked around as the pair walked inside, interested in the unsociable newcomer who'd they'd as yet had little contact with. Rita made eye contact with an old Weimaraner who sat on the other side of the room. \"Good to see you, Athena. You've met Willow? She's new to all this and could do with a friend or two on her side.\" Athena's pale eyes- one almost entirely clouded over, and serious gaze gave her a stern expression, but her smile was warm. \"I've seen her around, a quiet one it seems. A relative of yours, Rita?\" \"My little sister,\" Rita wagged her tail a little, pleased but not surprised that the old dog was open to getting acquainted with Willow. She turned back to her sister. \"Will, you'll have seen Athena round the place. She's Murphy's mate and one of the top dogs here.\" Willow found the gaze of the strange-looking Athena to be disconcerting, one of the reasons she had avoided contact with her until that point. She was not however, ill-mannered, and managed a small smile and a tail wag. \"Pleased to meet you. Your mate has been very hospitable.\" \"It's a pleasure to have you here. I know it takes a little while to settle, but you'll get there. If you just want to chat or anything, I'm always happy to give a listening ear.\" Athena said. The Weimaraner certainly didn't look very approachable to Willow's mind, but she seemed nice enough… not at all like the vicious creature she'd imagined her to be. \"Thank you, thanks a lot.\" They talked for a little while, occasionally joined by one or more of Athena's companions, until the older dog needed to go off to collect something to eat. Willow found herself infinitely more comfortable in the warehouse than she had been previously, feeling welcome. Rita was relieved that Willow was not as averse to socialising as she'd first thought, that all she needed was a little gentle prodding in the right direction. Dodger had been right; this was the best thing to do for her. Rita knew that she should have done this all along, and she should have known to do so… all that running around after Willow had been to appease her own feelings of guilt. But Willow wasn't that little puppy anymore, and Rita couldn't be her protector. She got to her feet. \"Come on, let's go for a walk.\" Willow could tell from the pained expression on her sister's face that she wasn't going to like what Rita had to say, but she came along, following her up towards the city. \"You did great back there, Will. We should have done that sooner, I should have…,\" Rita's voice caught in her throat. This was hard. \"Thing is, I don't think it's doing you any good to be relying on me so much. I'm just a reminder of everything you got away from, and everything you went through because I failed you,\" she whined softly, already seeing the anger rising up on Willow's face, \"If you hate me, I understand. I've let you down all over again… I'm sorry.\" \"So you're just going to walk away? Again? That's worked out real well for me before, great thinking there, sis,\" Willow snarled, \"Face it, you'd just rather be with your precious Dodger. Who needs family when you can have some creep of a mongrel to keep happy?\" she panted, the fury she felt threatening to get the better of her. Rita was not surprised by Willow's reaction, and held her ground. \"I told you before; they need me and I'm not letting them down. That's not up for discussion.\" She wouldn't budge, not on this. \"Forget about Dodger. Do you really want to be dependent on me? You're a grown woman with your own life to lead, I can't be your security blanket. I'm not the same person as I was back the either. Willie, I can't take back what I did to you, and I'm sorry, but we need to move on.\" Angry tears filled Willow's eyes. Perhaps she'd been clinging to some fantasy of a relationship with someone who she'd once loved. But Rita was right… neither of them were the same people, and what had once been was gone forever. \"You could have taken me with you. I know I'd treated you like dirt, but I was just a scared little kid. You could have taken me.\" \"You think I don't know that? I was a scared little kid too, Willow, I was desperate to escape from the home I hated. It didn't even enter my head that I could have taken you with me, not until it was too late. When I realised what I'd done…\" A lump had formed in Rita's throat as years' worth of emotions threatened to overpower her. Then the tears came. \"I went searching for you, I was convinced that you'd been left out on the streets, I thought I could fix it. It can't take away from your suffering, but I put myself through hell for you. I always loved you, always.\" Willow sobbed, torn between clinging desperately to her sister and pushing her away. \"I love you too,\" she whispered. \"You're going to be okay, I promise you. You're free now; you can make your life anything you want it to be. I'll see you when I can, and I'll help you where I can, but you're not going to move on if I keep holding on to you. You can do this, Willie. Everything's going to be okay.\" Rita wanted nothing more than to snuggle close to her sister, but knew that such contact would not be accepted. She gazed at Willow with great tenderness and hoped that she could feel how much she cared. They sat together for a long while, crying over what they'd lost. The road forward would be long and slow, for that was the way it had to be. When the sun dipped below the horizon, Rita started off home, and Willow watched, still teary. The wrongs of the past had been forgiven, but the goodbye was all the harder for it. Rita slowly walked back to the barge, taking her time so her tears would have subsided by the time she got home. She had appearances to keep up. The long dormant heartache that she'd thought was behind her now seemed to be healing for good. Rita knew that she and Willow had a long way still to go, but something seemed different between them- in a good way. Life could go back to normal, just with the added wonderful knowledge that her beloved Willow was safe, and eventually she was going to be all right. It was a bittersweet feeling, knowing that she'd have to put that bit of distance between them. Even in the dark that had fast fallen, Rita could make out the small figure of a dog sitting a little way up from the barge, waiting. The sight warmed her heart. A caring friend was just what she needed in that moment. \"I was startin' to wonder where you'd got to.\" Dodger said, \"Everything all right, babe?\" \"I'm fine. It's been a rough afternoon, I'll tell you,\" Rita sat down close beside him, \"I'm letting her go. I'll check up on her in a few days, but she's going to sort herself out without me. I managed to get her talking with Athena, so she's going to be well looked after. So, that's that. Maybe we'll be friends someday, but right now I'm just going to appreciate the fact that she's alive at all.\" \"Good call. Must be a lot for you to deal with; you need to talk or anything, you know where I am.\" He could see that she'd been crying, but all the same she didn't seem too upset. Rita was smiling warmly at him. \"Anyhow, we got news. Fagin managed to get a loan with some guy; not sure on the details but it means we're not going hungry for a while.\" Rita's smile faltered a little. \"But how are we ever going to pay-\" Dodger just shook his head, untroubled. \"Don't worry about it. Trust me, we'll sort it. Come on, let's get some food in you.\" Everyone was in high spirits, and well fed for the first time in a long time. The atmosphere in the barge was a happy one, and Rita found herself glad to be home and among her friends. It was like Dodger said; whatever happened, they'd work it out somehow. She could only hope that one day Willow might find herself just as happy. Willow curled up in her usual corner of the warehouse. The usual chatter of the many other dogs was for once not a cause of stress for her. She felt safe. For the first time since she stumbled across Rita again, she knew how she really felt about her older sister. They couldn't be together, not like before, but Willow knew that she loved Rita. The future was still frighteningly uncertain, but she at least felt like she had one now. She felt a new acceptance of her situation, and it was calming. It seemed that she was a street dog now, just like her father, and just like Rita. She was going to make it.[Chapter 9] Daughter of the infamous Dodger, Dash was cunning and resourceful; an accomplished street dog if there ever was one. Breaking free from her birth gang at two years old, she'd become leader of her own canine family; her best friends, a lumbering yet fun-loving mastiff-bulldog by the name of Jellybean and jovial and protective Rottweiler called Klaus, along with Jellybean's two young sons, Cocoa and Jaffa. Together they lived in the Bronx, in a secluded alley, not far from the tired old house where Dash's original master, Fagin, now lived. Their home was a jumble of discarded junk that made for cover from the weather and comfortable places to lay, and the alley led on to a car yard which had precious little human activity to worry about. Dash and Klaus were expert thieves, while Jellybean was competent at hunting mice and rats. For her small stature, Dash could pack a mean bite if she needed to defend herself, but it was the heavyweights Klaus and Jellybean who provided stellar security services- it would be a brave dog indeed to take either of them on. For dogs living off their own wits in the big city, Dash's small gang pretty much had it made. For the young leader, however, it felt as though something important was missing. No longer a pup, Dash felt a growing ache within her. It told her that she was ready to be a mother; that she was ready to rear her own pups, and shower them with all the love she had to give, and show them what it meant to live wild and free as a street dog. One substantial hurdle stood in her way, though; she had no mate, and so no potential father. Most bitches in her situation would do what Jellybean did, and simply seek out a candidate solely for producing a litter, but Dash was determined that she wanted a true soul mate, someone with whom she could share everything- including the love of a family that they might build together. It was all well and good in theory, but Dash wasn't a sociable type, and she was happy to just enjoy the company of the few close friends and family she already had. It took her a long time to feel comfortable in the presence of strangers, and was known for being somewhat aloof with anyone new. Such a personality trait did not set her in a good position to build a romantic relationship of any kind, and she was well aware of the fact. Klaus and Jellybean, in contrast, were both social butterflies- and well known for being real flirts. While they enjoyed wild nights out at all the busiest street dog meet-up joints, Dash would be content to stay home keeping an eye on the boys. It was a role she was happy to play, but still the worry lingered; would she ever find someone truly special to be a lifelong partner? As time went on, the thought of having a mate by her side sounded more and more appealing; to have someone with whom she could trust with great emotional intimacy, someone who understood her quirks and her silly fears. Yes, she thought, it was what she really wanted for herself… but how to make it happen was beyond her. It was a crisp, rainy day when Dash first laid eyes on the athletic, lop-eared hound. Ironic really, for his name was 'Sunshine'. In some ways though, it had to be fitting, because for a reason beyond Dash's comprehension, just the sight of him made her happy. He had wrinkles around his eyes; the sort that you expected to see in someone who'd spent a great deal of their life smiling. Sunshine appeared jovial anyway, his tail held high and a real spring to his gait. Dash was transfixed as she watched him move, his muscles rippling slightly under his shiny coat. He was bounding around, apparently just for the fun of it- directionless and carefree. Her shyness threatening to get the better of her, Dash had to push herself to run forward and join him. As a dog who was very particular about who she formed connections with, she knew someone special when she saw them. This hound gave her a warm feeling, as though they were old friends. How could she not take the plunge and say 'hello'? But then, as she made to move forward and greet this stranger, who was now skipping through puddles, Dash's nervousness got the better of her. Somehow it felt vital that she didn't mess this up, for this dog was someone who'd be important to her in some way. Sunshine looked up, and noticed that he was being watched. Though Dash hastily looked away, he couldn't help but get a good feeling about her, and he wuffed a greeting. \"Hello! Sorry, I didn't see you there.\" He shook the water from his coat, worried that he'd been acting a fool in front of a stranger. \"Hi,\" she said, walking forward and having finally found her nerve. \"I've not seen you around here,\" she glanced to the collar that hung around his neck,\" you haven't lost your humans, have you?\" \"Sorta,\" Sunshine replied, shrugging, \"but I'm in no hurry to find them again. To be honest, it's good even to bump into another dog. I haven't had anyone to talk to for a while.\" He could only hope that this pretty stranger would not refuse his company just because he was a pet- he'd never known a street dog before, and Dash's lack of collar and rough appearance told him that she was one. \"Well, you're lucky you ran into me; not all the dogs in this city are friendly- especially to a pet,\" Dash said. For a pet, this guy seemed pretty unconcerned about being all on his own in the city, and that was rather impressive. Out of nowhere, her shyness once more reared its head. \"I, er, I just thought you looked like you were having a nice time, and, er, I wondered if you'd mind if I joined you- just until I have to get on with things.\" Sunshine rapidly wagged his tail, realising that he might have found his first friend in ages. \"You any good at chase? I'm pretty fast, but you can take me on if you're feeling up to it.\" Dash laughed, her confidence returning just as quickly as it had left her now the threat of rejection had passed. \"Fast? Honey, I don't think you even know the meaning of the word. I'll show you what a dog can really do.\" She dropped to the ground in a quick play bow, and then jumped up, giving Sunshine's shoulder a nip and then high-tailing it away. He seemed confident, but Dash knew he'd have no chance besting her at a game of chase. Immediately, Dash became aware that Sunshine actually did have an impressive turn of speed. He ran with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, a sign of his unbridled delight in the freedom of movement. For a change, Dash actually had to work hard to keep out of reach of her pursuer, and it made the game a whole lot more fun. Panting, she leapt up onto a passing car; it was technically cheating, but car surfing just came naturally. Sunshine's eyes widened, and he skidded underneath the moving vehicle, ducking to avoid being knocked clean off his paws. He scrambled, frightened, back onto the sidewalk as a horn blared. \"Geez, are you okay?\" Dash called down to him from a parked taxi, taken by surprise. Sunshine shook himself, embarrassed. \"What are you doing up there? Don't you know those things are dangerous?\" \"Sorry, I'm just used to getting around this way. I didn't think. You're not hurt?\" Still panting from the fright, Sunshine shook his head. \"Nah…nah, ya just scared me. I wasn't expecting that!\" He looked into Dash's face, puzzled by her strange behaviour. She was like no dog he'd ever encountered; he'd not put much thought into what sort of creature a street dog might be. Something in her eyes said that she was to be trusted, and Sunshine had faith in his instincts about her. He stepped backwards, allowing Dash to join him. \"So,\" he said, his tail wagging slowly, \"you don't mind if I take the low road? I'll leave this weird car-riding stuff to the expert, I think.\" Dash grinned, pleased that Sunshine hadn't been scared off. \"As long as you don't mind eating my dust,\" she said, a playful gleam in her eyes. Sunshine yipped his response to the challenge and turned to tear down the street. As he felt Dash upon his heels he sped up, revelling in the challenge, and the feeling of having something he could liken to a friend. For a long period, the two dogs ran back and forth through the streets, with Sunshine causing several cars to come to a screeching halt in order to avoid the clumsy dog. Dash found his complete lack of street skills quite endearing, and made sure he stayed out of any real danger. She had a family to feed, though, and she couldn't let that responsibility slip. \"You don't need help, do you?\" Sunshine asked, hopeful that his newfound friend wouldn't be walking away from him quite yet. \"I have a good nose.\" \"I guess it wouldn't hurt, maybe we could get to know each other a little better. I'll admit, I'm curious; if you're a pet, what are you doing running loose out here?\" \"Just because I'm a pet, doesn't mean I think the world revolves around my humans. I did once, but they made me sacrifice everything else that mattered to me. I know it sounds kinda weird, but I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to have dog friends, but now… now it's just me.\" The hound shook himself, not wanting to go all gloomy on his pretty new friend, and turned his focus to her. \"So, what about you? You're a stray, living with other dogs? That must be wonderful.\" Dash got to her feet, ready to start her search. She was, though, happy to have his companionship as she dealt with the task at hand. \"Yeah, I'm a street dog. I live with a couple of friends, and now two little pups as well. I won't lie, it can be a hard life, but for me it feels right. We take care of each other, and it makes a big difference.\" She paused, as it dawned on her that she hadn't even introduced herself properly to the dog she'd spent the morning with, nor did she know his name. \"Sorry- my name's Dash, by the way. I probably should have done that bit earlier.\" \"Well, I guess that's fitting, I don't think I've met a dog so quick on their feet,\" he said. \"My name's Sunshine. Or Sunny. Whatever you prefer.\" Dash smiled. \"Pleased to meet you, Sunny. If you're sure you want to, it'd be nice to have some company. I might be able to show you a thing or two about the street life.\" As it happened, Sunshine had been right about his good nose, and he make a beeline for a café serving breakfast from a couple of blocks away. Dash couldn't help but be impressed. She set him the task of leaping onto a diner's lap, licking and wagging as though the confused human was a long-lost friend. It was just the diversion Dash needed, and she was able to swoop in and take hold of two plump, warm sausages, which she stashed away in the faded green woolly hat that she wore everywhere. As a team, she and Sunshine managed to snag another three sausages, four rashers of bacon, and even a whole breakfast bagel. Compared to the boring bowls of cardboard-tasting kibble he was faced with each day, this seemed to Sunshine like the real way to get fed. In his old home, he'd go out and hunt for rabbits or even squirrels, and to actually work for something again was deeply satisfying. What was more, Dash appeared to get a lot out of having him join her as well. With the hat bulging with drool-worthy pickings, the two dogs started back towards the Bronx, where they'd first met, and where Dash had two ravenous puppies waiting. \" Dash! \" came a booming voice with a thick accent, causing Sunshine to almost jump out of his skin. Spinning around, he saw the approaching figure of a muscular Rottweiler; he could only assume this was one of Dash's band of street dogs. Dash barked back to Klaus, and her tail wagged a mile a minute. \"Heya, Klausie!\" she called, having placed the hat full of food at her feet. \"You can tell the boys that breakfast is served.\" She turned back to her new friend, Sunshine, with a kind and genuine smile. \"I've really enjoyed hanging out with you,\" she said. \"If you get tired of being cooped up and want someone to have a little fun with, just hang around the same corner… I'll find you.\" Sunshine grinned; another morning like this was more than he could have hoped for. High on the excitement of actually enjoying himself for the first time in weeks, he dared to push his luck further. \"If you want, maybe we could go for a bite to eat together sometime; like a date? I dunno what it is about you, and I know it sounds weird, but it just feels… you know, right.\" Feeling her cheeks burn hot, Dash looked at her paws. In her few years of life, she'd never been asked out… not romantically. Pulling herself together, she looked into Sunshine's earnest face, which showed increased nervousness with every moment that passed. \"Yeah; yeah, all right,\" she stuttered, finally. \"Actually, I… I'd really like that. And it doesn't sound weird- not really. It's not often I meet someone who I feel so comfortable to be around, not straight away.\" Dash felt her heart leap at the look on Sunshine's face; he looked as though he understood exactly what she meant. \"Maybe sundown tomorrow? I'll meet you at the same corner.\" Sunshine beamed. \"Tomorrow at sundown, I'll be there,\" he said, feeling light as a feather. Growing impatient, Klaus had ambled over. \" Kleiner freund , the puppies, sey vill eat their own mother if they keep vait for breakfast,\" he said, and he eyed up Sunshine. \"Sey vant to go and play vith your niece; they von't shut up all morning. I sink ve should maybe leave sem vith your mosser.\" He winked. Sunshine was completely bewildered by Klaus' strong accent, but understood that Dash had family to get to. \"I'll see ya, then,\" he said, and he turned to head home. Dash grinned and watched him go. \"See ya tomorrow,\" she called after him, causing him to wag his long, whippy tail. Dash wasn't quite sure what had just happened, but a little voice inside her told her that in some way or another, Sunshine would be important to her. For Sunshine, returning home was a wrench. 'Home' was a dark, cement-lined courtyard, joined by a dog door to a dark, narrow house. It was his humans' home really; not his. Sunshine wasn't sure how many weeks it had been now that this had been his life, but he knew it felt like too long. He lay on the concrete pavers and stared at the fence. Having spent many hours in such a position, he knew every crack and whorl in the wood, and the constant noise of moving traffic no longer prevented him from getting to sleep. Sunshine's rebellious jaunts into the city had been getting progressively longer as he dared to risk being caught out as a runaway, but he still spent most of his day trying to escape in dreams to where he was meant to be. Sunshine's actual home was a sprawling country property upstate, surrounded by equally sprawled out neighbours and the scents and sounds of the wilderness. He could run, and gallop, and run some more, and his realm would just keep stretching out before him. It was into that world where he'd been born; his parents had whelped him on a neighbouring farm, and he'd grown up in a community of dogs who'd happily flitted between their masters' property, and those of their many friends. Sunshine had always assumed that it had simply been how all dogs must have lived their lives. There had been no reason for him to even have an inkling that such thing as a city even existed. But then in Dash, he'd seen something different, but something that gave him that same feeling that home always had. She was street, but she was a dog in the sense that he understood. A dog who knew her own kind, one self-sufficient, yet full of the joys that canine bonds brought. Sunshine hadn't imagined that in this towering world so human and artificial, that the true dog spirit could survive, or even thrive. What was Dash? To Sunshine, she was something new; something beautiful. Just in spending that morning with the young street dog, Sunshine felt that there might be something still there that made his days worthwhile. Perhaps, he pondered, his chin resting on his paws; perhaps he'd just met the most important friend in his life.[Chapter 10] Dash turned the corner just as the sun dipped below the horizon. To her relief, Sunny was waiting for her as they'd agreed, a single pink rose in his mouth. Feigning confidence, for this dating business was something all knew to her, Dash gave a sharp bark to announce her presence. \"Hey, Sunshine!\" she called, her tail wagging. \"So, you remembered?\" Sunny's tail was a blur. The past day had dragged so slowly, even more than most, but finally his new friend was here. That he was of any interest at all to a wily street dog baffled the hound, and he was determined to make a good impression. Bringing a flower had been a last minute idea, and he'd scrambled around nearby gardens before fortunately coming across one with a pretty appearance and a nice scent. \"'Course I remembered!\" Sunny barked, voice slightly muffled. \"How could I forget after all the fun we had?\" He bounced onto his front in a bow and back up again, in spite of his nerves. \"Do you have anywhere in mind to go?\" he asked. \"I figured you'd have a better idea than me.\" Coming forward to give her new friend a nuzzle of greeting, Dash considered her options. They had a whole city available to them, but she knew that Sunny lacked the traffic sense to properly enjoy the busier areas where she'd usually frequent. \"There's a park not too far from here- not a huge one or anything, but it might be a nice place to run. We could swipe something to snack on and chill out under a tree or somethin'?\" Sunny's eyes widened as he followed Dash around the corner to Rainey Park. It had been many weeks since he'd seen so much space… and grass. \"Woah!\" he breathed. \"It's great, huh?\" said Dash. \"I can't wait 'til the pups are big enough to come out here and have a good run. No cars or anything!\" She jumped forward and ran across the road, onto the edge of the wide stretch of grass where she somersaulted onto her back. Sunny yipped and leapt over Dash, then bowed down to invite her into a flirty tussle. They sparred with their forepaws, nipped at one another's ears, and rolled around in the freshly mowed grass until their backs and sides were stained green. Dash sneezed as grass clippings tickled her nose, causing Sunny to chortle. He bounced forward, enticing her to chase. And then they ran. Galloping with long strides, the two dogs took to the vast, open space. The feeling of the wind rushing past their ears and the thrill of the challenge brought them both to a place of euphoria. As Dash took the lead, she cockily egged Sunny forward, and he was soon right on her heels, his face full of joy. When they finally tired, the two dogs strolled around the park together, taking the opportunity to better get to know one another, talking long after the sky was completely dark. Caught up in enjoying the company they shared, any thoughts of going for a snack were forgotten, though every now and then they'd stop at a puddle to lap up some water. \"How long have you been in the city?\" Dash asked, aware that Sunny was new to the Big Apple. \"It's a lot to get your head around, huh?\" \"I've lost track… must be a while now, but it feels longer 'cause I've been so bored in the boss' yard. Where I'm from, there aren't many buildings or cars, and they're all far apart. I didn't even know places like this existed.\" Dash furrowed her eyebrows. \"You must have come from a long way.\" \"Yeah,\" Sunny said, nodding. \"It was a long drive to get here; too far to remember the way or I probably woulda run home.\" He winced, realising how awful a pet he sounded. \"I know how bad that sounds… but my boss, I don't even feel like I know him anymore. I don't know if I could ever really do a runner; I'm not like you, I can't make my own decisions. You're pretty lucky to have a dog family- a real family, rather than a human boss.\" \"I used to have a human,\" Dash said, and she smiled at the look of surprise on Sunny's face. \"I lived with my parents' master for a couple of years. But it was different; Fagin's almost like a dog to us- he's never really been our boss. I still see him every now and then, 'cause we're friends. I think I was right to leave though; I'm so proud of my gang- there's not many of us, but we get by real well, and we look out for each other.\" Sunny felt a pang of longing. He'd had a canine family, and it gave him a sense of belonging that no human could give. At least, he thought, he now had Dash… a friend who seemed to understand him. Dash continued. \"But it's a hard life out here; when it gets cold, there's no heater to sit by, and hardly any food to fill you up. Even when I was with Fagin we went hungry a lot,\" she said. \"There were a lot of dogs I've known- not close friends, 'cause I don't really have many of them, but dogs I know who've just disappeared, and no one ever knows what happens to them. It's the price you pay for freedom, and it's why I gotta have my friends' backs. If we take care of each other, we can make a breeze of it- at least some of the time.\" \"Do you think your friends would mind if I joined you guys? Maybe just when my boss is at work?\" Sunny asked, earnestly. \"I really like you, Dash, and I wanna get to know you better.\" A warm smile came to Dash's face and her eyes lit up. \"Yeah? I'd love to hang out with you; and I bet the others would like you too,\" she said. \"Actually, you'd be hard pressed to meet a dog that Klaus or Jellybean don't like; they're about as friendly as they come.\" Dash wagged her tail, becoming excited as she saw her own eagerness reflected in Sunny's eyes. \"There's a thing or two I could show you about the street life.\" \"Who knows? You might even be able to make a street dog outta me!\" Sunny laughed, then looked away guiltily. What was he thinking ? If his master only knew… Dash gently nuzzled Sunny's shoulder. \"Perhaps,\" she said, suspecting what had suddenly troubled him. \"Or maybe we could just have some fun together, and see what happens? I could see you every day and you'd still have your human to go home to. Best of both worlds.\" Sunny smiled appreciatively and nuzzled back. He loved the feel of her fur against his face. It was strange; he hadn't have feelings this strong towards anyone since his raging adolescent crush on the collie from two farms over. \"You should show me your place,\" Dash said, \"so I can come find you. Once you're feeling better about cars I could take you out further; you'd love Central Park- it's almost like not being in a city at all!\" They talked as they strolled out of the expanse of green and back into the concrete jungle. For someone who usually found conversation to be a challenge, Dash had no trouble at all in sharing a bit of herself with Sunny. Indeed, she found it difficult at times to draw her eyes from his handsome, friendly face and his twinkling eyes. It was a shame, she thought, that such a nice dog was being wasted cooped up in some yard by a human that barely cared. Dash was determined to do what she could to make Sunny's life happier; and more than that, she hoped this undeniable spark between them might blossom into something more. \"This is it,\" Sunny said, coming to a halt in front of a white-fronted house, which was near identical to the other houses lining the street. It was cold and boring, and could never feel like home to him. \"I probably better get back before the boss goes nuts on me,\" he said, a hint of sadness in his voice. Feeling suddenly daring, he leaned in and licked Dash's cheek, and was thrilled to see her beam with pleasure. It was hard to get too down in the dumps when someone as beautiful as she was looking at him with such fondness. \"So, I'll wait around here- just come for me whenever you want; I'll be around.\" Dash tentatively returned Sunny's lick, and then their eyes met. There was such warmth in Sunny's soft, dark eyes; such sincerity. Becoming embarrassed by their long-held gaze, Dash briefly looked down at her paws, but could not keep herself from looking at Sunny for long. \"I'll see ya, then,\" she said. \"G'dnight, Sunshine.\" \"G'dnight, Dash.\" Dash found herself drawn back to Sunny's house time and time again, the pull to be with the handsome young hound growing ever stronger. He'd proven himself to be a hit with the rest of her small gang; desperate as he was to have canine company, the coonhound mix had not been slow to make friends, and pups Cocoa and Jaffa were particularly enamoured with this fun-loving newcomer. Sunny had seemingly never-ending energy, and could easily keep up with the gang of street dogs- at least as long as they stayed away from the traffic. It was, however, Dash whose company he would mostly seek, and her affection toward him continued to grow as they spent hour after happy hour side by side. There was more to Sunny than he liked to let on; he wasn't just a wayward pet searching for a few thrills, he was dealing with the feeling of displacement and a nagging insecurity that he didn't really belong anywhere. Dash felt for him, and regularly acted as a listening ear when Sunny was feeling down or conflicted. Much as he didn't make a good pet, she had to admit that he wasn't anything to shout about when it came to being a street dog either. Sunny had no road sense whatsoever, and likely would have been flattened by now if Dash hadn't hastily pulled him out the way of an oncoming car on several occasions; what was more, he happily approached just about any human, seemingly unaware of the dangers they might bring. Jellybean was of the opinion that Sunny simply wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but Dash knew better. Sunny was a deep thinker, a clever hunter, and a supportive friend, and for that she had great admiration. While Jellybean and Klaus were at the happiest in wild gatherings, surrounded by congregations of dogs, Sunny seemed to have the most fun when it was just him and Dash. Like her, he loved to run, and together they explored the far reaches of the city, sharing deep, intimate conversations and rollicking games of chase-and-wrestle. Every day, Sunny had a greater reluctance to return to his master, and Dash couldn't help but wish he could simply run away and live freely with her. If nothing else, Sunny deserved to feel wanted, and he sure wasn't getting that from his human boss. Dash was slowly falling in love, and she was quietly suspicious that her dear friend, Sunny, felt the same about her. After a long day of gallivanting the streets, Dash and Sunny retired to Central Park, where they could relax under the shade of the trees by the lake. As Dash had suspected, the sprawling oasis had quickly become Sunny's favourite place in the whole city, and his happiness at being there was infectious. They sat quietly side by side, contentedly watching the water lap at the bank, and comfortable enough that words were not needed. Sunny felt a smile tug at his face as he looked over to his friend, whose golden fur shone in the late afternoon sunlight. It still seemed surreal to him that she'd taken an interest in him at all; he was just some common pet, dependent on humans and nothing particularly special. Just looking at her made his stomach give pleasurable flips. He was grateful though, the past weeks having been a blur of one happy day after another, and all because of Dash. A little nervous, he got up and walked behind Dash, close so that he could affectionately nuzzle her fluffy ears. Seeing her grin in response, he snuggled nearer to her, a statement of his growing desire and feelings of tenderness. The fluttery feeling from deep within was new to Dash, but she liked it. Seemingly unsure of what he was doing, Sunny made to move away, a look of slight nervousness on his face- and immediately Dash felt his absence. Those few moments of closeness were all it had taken, but now she felt that she needed to be with him. The feeling was something stronger than anything she'd ever experienced, and while she might normally have been intimidated by the sensation of losing control of her emotions, Dash was not remotely afraid- how could she be with her beloved Sunshine by her side? As Sunny turned to face her, Dash leant in and gently touched her mouth to his, inviting him to take the next step. Their eyes closed, the two dogs shared a soft and loving kiss. When they came away, Dash's face fell as she saw the expression on Sunshine's. \"I'm sorry, was that too fast?\" Dash stammered, embarrassed. \"I'm…\" Sunny shook his head quickly. \"No, no, it's not that,\" he said, mortified as he realised she might have taken his uncertainty as a reflection on his feelings for her. \"That was nice, Dashie; it was… perfect. I'm just scared. You make me happier than I've been in a real long time, and I want to be with you. But I'm a pet- I'm tied to my humans. I'm scared of falling in love with you and then being forced to walk away.\" He whimpered in distress. \"I was happy before and my humans took it from me; it could happen again. I don't know what to do.\" Dash's heart sank. She'd been so swept up in her developing feelings for Sunny that the reality of it had escaped her. They were worlds apart, just too different. But she wasn't about to give in, not without a fight. \"I understand,\" she said sadly, \"and I don't know if we can make anything of this, but you are so special to me, Sunshine. We can't give up without even trying. I…,\" she hesitated for a moment, but couldn't hold back. \"I love you.\" Sunshine's lip trembled. With Dash he could have a future beyond anything he could have dreamed of- a life of freedom alongside someone who set his heart on fire, but could he swallow his fear? \"I love you too,\" he said, a small smile forming on his face. Something between them had changed, and there was no going back. \"We'll work this out,\" Dash said, feeling almost giddy at hearing confirmation that he truly felt for her the way she did for him. \"Whatever it takes, I want to be with you. My sweet Sunshine.\" His eyes bright with tears forming, Sunshine beamed. He'd lost everything; his home, his friends, all the happiness in his life, but in Dash he'd found joy once more. She was right; nothing should be allowed to stand in their way. \"Whatever it takes, Dash,\" he murmured, and he drew her back into a tender kiss. The sun set over the park, and the cover of darkness gave the young dogs a sanctuary in which they could celebrate their togetherness. Each felt a great knowing from deep within that they'd found the one person with whom they were born to share everything, a soul mate. Neither knew how they'd make it work, but it was clear as the moon shining in the sky; they were meant to be.[Chapter 11] A pulsing beat drew Sunny to Dash's alley; when her gang was home, music was almost always playing. He found himself absent-mindedly strutting and skipping to the beat. As Sunny rounded the corner, his face broke into a broad smile. \"Sunshine!\" Dash exclaimed, and she ran forward to lick her sweetheart's muzzle. Sunny reciprocated, his tail wagging wildly from side to side at the very sight of Dash. \"Sorry I took so long, Dashie,\" he said, \"The master took his time leaving today, probably something was up.\" The two youngest members of the gang, Cocoa and Jaffa, rushed forward to greet their playmate. They thought very highly of Sunny and welcomed his visits- in fact, they'd not been subtle in dropping hints that the friendly hound might make an excellent permanent addition to the alley gang. Quietly, Dash agreed that it would be really wonderful if Sunny did stay for good, but she knew that he valued his commitment to his master, and respected that. It was hard, but she was prepared to live with it, rather than put him through the distress of turning his back on what was left of his old life. \"You really did take your time, pet,\" said Jellybean, who sauntered over to join her sons. \"Some of us have been waiting around to go for breakfast.\" Dash nipped Jellybean's side. \"Give the guy a break, Bean; he's his human's pet, not yours.\" She knew that Jellybean had actually taken quite a shine to Sunny, but it mattered a lot to Dash that he felt accepted. Klaus grinned. \"No vorry. Ve go find food now- Sunny always does find somesing good.\" The group headed off, with Sunny, nose to the ground, taking the lead, with Dash by his side and the others trailing behind. The newcomer had far and away the best sense of smell, and he had quickly become a valuable asset to the gang. The feeling of being included and wanted by a gang of wild street dogs was an immense thrill to Sunny, but more than that, he simply couldn't get enough of his closeness to Dash. She saw something in him, and it made his spirit soar. Dash couldn't imagine feeling happier. The days were getting colder, and she would soon be facing her very first winter as leader of her own gang. The pressure was on, but surrounded by her three closest friends, she was confident and unafraid. She looked over to Sunny with a soft smile, and had only a split second to react when she saw that he was just about to follow his nose into the path of an oncoming car. With a rush of adrenaline, she pulled back and grabbed a hold of his tail with her sharp teeth and dug her heels in. \"Woah! Watch it! \" Jellybean barked. \"You wanna get pancaked?\" Sunny scuttled back into the sidewalk, feeling more than a little embarrassed. However hard he tried, road-sense continued to elude him, and it was becoming a source of great frustration. Seeing the look on his face, Dash gave Sunny and encouraging nuzzle. \"Hey, don't worry. We all have our near-misses. You'll get the hang of it; it just takes time, honey.\" \"Come on,\" Klaus said, amiably, \"you just take it slower and look around. You take us to food, no problem. We make sure you don't get hurt.\" In the Rottweiler's eyes, the hound was a huge asset, and a friend. They made allowances to keep the pups safe, and they'd do so for Sunny while he learned the ropes as well. There were no more hiccups, and Sunny proved himself once again by leading the others to a discarded roast chicken in a trash can- and it was almost untouched by the humans who'd thrown it out. Each taking a leg, Dash and Sunny ran off together; the day was theirs to enjoy side by side, and they spent it exploring the edge of the great Hudson River. Both dogs were tireless, and the constant movement kept them warm as a chill fell upon the city. They roamed up into Yonkers, and still the river went on… it seemed like the expanse of water must keep going forever. Sunny wondered if it was the same river that run close to his old home; something linking the two lives that had shaped him into the confused dog he now was. For a change of scenery, they headed East until they hit the string of sprawling parks that peppered the long road home. Even after hour upon hour of walking and playing, neither Dash nor Sunny looked forward to their parting. Sunny's heart sank as his house came into view. More and more, he felt that he didn't belong there- he belonged with Dash. His conflicting loyalties kept him up through his nights, with his escape being the adventures he shared with his friend and lover. He could see from the look on Dash's face that he hated this nightly parting every bit as much as he did. \"I really hate this, Dash,\" he said. Dash licked his muzzle. \"I know, me too,\" she murmured. \"I keep thinking it'll get easier, but it just doesn't.\" \"I wish I could bring myself to cut loose from the boss, but it's so, so hard.\" Sunny tenderly nuzzled Dash's face. \"I'll do it… I know I will; it's gonna happen. You'll wait around for me?\" \"You can count on it.\" Dash was just turning to leave, when Sunny came running back out the house with two thick blankets over his back and a packet of pork chops in his mouth. \"What are you doing? Your human's gonna freak!\" \"Just as well he's home late,\" Sunny said, dropping the meat at his paws. \"I've got some blankets for you all; figured you'd make better use of them than I would. And dinner. One night out can't help, can it?\" Dash beamed. A night with Sunny was something she just couldn't say refuse. Loyalty to his human was fair, but she was pleased that he was gaining more control over his life… and his own happiness. \"Well, look who it is!\" Jellybean laughed, as Dash and Sunny turned into the alley together. \"So, you're doing sleepovers now, huh? Things must be heating up.\" Dash scoffed. \"With the kids around? Not likely!\" \"Dinner's on me,\" said Sunny, \"and I'm stocking you guys up with blankets as well. Can't have you getting the shivers at night.\" \" Danke, Sun,\" Klaus said, his mouth wet with saliva as his eyes found the pork chops. \"Ve are much grateful.\" Sunny wagged his tail, enjoying the feeling of really being in the fold. \"I gotta pull my weight if want in.\" Young Cocoa had swaggered over. \"Are you really staying?\" he asked, looking Sunny up and down. He couldn't help but hope that his and Jaffa's persistent badgering had paid off. Cuffing the pup over the head, Sunny laughed. \"One night, kid! Don't get too excited.\" \"Aw, man!\" Sunny exchanged a glance with Dash, who was warmly looking over the interaction between her lover and the family she adored. \"Well,\" he said, \"we've gotta start somewhere. You might make a real street dog out of me yet!\" \"I reckon we're up to the challenge,\" said Jaffa, whose tail was wagging fast. When the pups settled down to sleep on the floor of the broken down old car, the adults continued to talk; wrapped up in the thick blankets, it didn't feel necessary to curl up and go to sleep for the night. Klaus had retired to his own bed; a pile of blankets and newspaper sheltered by a tattered umbrella, and Jellybean was reclining beside him, where she could keep an eye on her sleeping sons. On top of the car, Dash and Sunny huddled together under one blanket, their paws entwined before them. Dash was leaning into Sunny's shoulder, and her woollen hat was askew as she slowly slid further into him. \"We're gonna need to be on point with winter coming in,\" Jellybean was saying. \"You seen how bare the trees are; it'll be snowing soon enough.\" Getting her two precious sons through the next difficult months was her top priority, and her usual pension for late nights on the town had given way. Not being as sociable as she preferred to be, the presence of the energetic young Sunny was particularly welcome. \"If you're coming on board, Sunny, you gotta be prepared for a rough ride.\" Dash was confident that Sunny would go from strength to strength once he had a chance to really learn the ways of the streets. \"An extra dog on the team would be good news. More bodies to huddle with on cold nights.\" She snuggled closer to Sunny, loving the smile it brought to his sweet face. \"The pups will soon be able to help out. We sailed through feeding you and the pups when they were young; this winter will be a piece of cake.\" \"I sink,\" said Klaus, with a wide yawn, \"sat I vill miss se varm house my master has. I vas not cold ever. Even ven it snow. I am glad I have friends to stay varm vith.\" Sunny thought back to the roaring fire that he spent his winter nights beside in days past. The smell of the burning wood, and the sounds of crackling as flames engulfed them could so easily be reached in his recollections. Those had to be some of his happiest memories; tired after long days gallivanting the surrounding countryside, the heat against his tired paws was soothing, as were the voices of his master and mistress. Another loud yawn from Klaus interrupted Sunny's thoughts. Jellybean spoke. \"I'm with you, Klausie; time for bed. Cocoa will be up at the crack of dawn as usual, so I'll enjoy what sleep I can get. While their companions drifted off to sleep, Dash and Sunny were content just to be together. Dash was aware of Sunny quietly taking in his surroundings. He'd never stayed out somewhere like this overnight, and the sounds must all have been new to him- in his home, strange human voices and car engines were unlikely to be quite so prominent this late at night. But still he felt relaxed beside her, as if he'd be happy anywhere so long as they were together. Dash looked up at the inky sky that faded from the lights that hung over the city. \"I bet,\" she said, \"the sky's really pretty where you're from. No human stuff, just the sky, all on its own.\" \"It's beautiful; stars everywhere, and it just goes on forever. It's quiet, and peaceful. Maybe one day we could go and see it together. I'd like to share it with you.\" Sliding down onto her side, Dash said, \"I'd like that. I'd never really imagined a world beyond this city… I must sound real ignorant; but I've never known nothin' else. I can't even imagine what your home must be like; the sounds and the smells.\" She looked into Sunny's face. \"It's a shame you can't share your memories with me. I wish I could really understand who you are. I love you so much, but there's that huge part of you that I can't even try and comprehend.\" Sunny tenderly licked the side of Dash's face. \"I love you too. You know what, Dash, you understand me more than anyone ever has. I honestly don't know how I'd have kept putting one paw in front of the other if you hadn't found me. You understand the stuff that really matters- don't worry about the rest.\" He looked out into the street ahead, contemplating. \"I think I have to do it soon. Leave the boss.\" \"Whatever you decide, honey, I'll support you all the way. I know how hard it must be to let it all go. You've already been forced to lose so much, I'd never want you to feel like you have to leave the rest behind for me.\" Dash yawned, and snuggled down into Sunny, closing her eyes with the comforting feeling of his body around hers. \"Dash?\" \"Mmm hmmm?\" \"Would you take me as your mate? I couldn't have imagined I could go from feeling so lost, to being the happiest I've ever been. I want to be your partner for the rest of my life, if you'll have me.\" Dash lifted her head and looked into Sunny's face, her expression one of stunned amazement. She was lost for words, and could only lovingly nuzzle his cheek and neck, while her eyes filled with tears. Finally, the words come. \"I would love that more than anything. I want to share my life with you, Sunshine, and be there for you always, like I know you'd be there for me. You can be my mate as long as you'll take me as yours!\" Sunny gave a gasp and whimper, feeling completely giddy, while Dash gave a joyful squirm beside him. They huddled together, tenderly nuzzling and kissing one another, until they collapsed into a cosy embrace. \"I'm so glad I came out with you tonight,\" Sunny whispered. He took in everything, for now the city that had felt so alien was now a source of comfort and a stronger feeling of home than he'd ever experienced before. He knew, though, that it wasn't the city that made him feel at home, but Dash. \"Come on, buddy- car ride!\" the master called to a confused Sunny early the next morning. It was most unusual. Car rides were rare; if they did happen, the meant a trip to the dreaded vet, but the master seemed upbeat about whatever was about to occur. Sunny was suspicious. The master had been threatening ominous sounding 'obedience classes'- whatever that meant. Before Sunny had a chance to suss the situation out, he was already leashed and being tugged toward the door. Like it or not, he was going on a little road trip. As the car rolled along, Sunny looked out the window in curiosity. Buildings, cars and people flew past, and then the world became greener, the houses grew further apart. With a nervous jolt, the hound realised that he was being taken out of the city, away from Dash. But where was he going? He gave an anxious whine. \"Relax, boy,\" the master said soothingly. \"We're not going anywhere scary; you'll soon be home.\" Home? Sunny was bewildered. Did the master mean they were going back to the country house, to the open fields, to the land of his birth? A knot formed in Sunny's stomach. He couldn't bear to be parted with Dash, but once more he was at the mercy of his humans. Why? He wondered desperately, why can't I be free to make my life what I want it to be? Sunny whimpered some more, feeling utterly helpless. He could do nothing but wait to see what his human had decided for his future this time. Surely, surely , he wasn't going to be made to lose everything he valued all over again. Had he known what was happening, he'd have fought with all his might to avoid being uprooted once again. With Dash he had a family, and he just couldn't lose that. For miles, they drove on, until Sunny had no doubt where they were going. He recognised the grocery store, outside which he'd often been tethered while the master shopped, and the vet where he'd been given those horrible needles in his youth. He saw trees he used to mark, and fences that hid dogs he used to play with. The familiarity should have been soothing, and perhaps it might have been if Dash had come with him, but it felt wrong, as though he was betraying the dear friend he'd come to love so dearly by revisiting this past. Who was to say he wouldn't be expected to stay in this familiar old place for good… and never again see the young dog he'd dreamed he'd become a mate to? To Sunny's surprise, the master drove past the turn they used to take to the old country-house and took the next left, down a dirt road to the cabin that held even deeper memories for the hound. It was here that Sunny had been whelped, and here that his mother and father lived still. In spite of his distress, Sunny hung his head out of the open window and searched with wide eyes for any signs of the first family he ever had. And there she was… his mother. Sunny gave a melodious bay of relief; he'd never imagined he'd see that face again, and the comfort it brought now was immeasurable. The car was still rolling along when he leapt from the moving vehicle. He ran towards his mother with his tail held high and his whole bottom wiggling. \"Sunshine!\" cried the beagle, whose eyes sparkled with happiness at the sight of her son. The beagle's name was Quarry, and she was a tall bitch for her breed. Her dark coat was lit up with patches of bright white, and the first grey hairs were appearing around her kind face. Even in her surprise at the sudden reappearance of Sunny, she recovered quick enough to run and greet him in the middle of her grassy front yard. It would have been difficult for any onlookers to say whether mother's or son's tail was waving the fastest, for both had become blurs in their excitement. Quarry frantically licked Sunny's face, giving him many months' affectionate gestures in a few seconds. Oh, how she'd missed him. The master, having parked up the car, exchanged pleasantries with the old lady who cared for Sunny's parents. There was a shaking of hands, a solemn nod, but none of it was given any notice by the two dogs who ran in circles around them. In fact, until the master crouched down and called Sunny's name, the hound had quite forgotten he was even there. \"There's a good boy,\" the master grumbled with a crooked smile. \"It's like we got the old you back. I figured you'd be better off this way. I'll miss you, buddy, but I can't give you what you need anymore.\" Sunny fell solemn. Was this goodbye? He whined and licked the master's hands. Was he to stay here… without his human? Was it not a dog's duty to remain loyal to one master? And how would he ever see Dash again if his city-living master simply up and left? \"You behave yourself for Mrs Turner, all right? I better not be getting any phone calls saying you've chewed up her chair legs or dug up the carpet.\" The master rubbed Sunny's side, and then got to his feet. He walked away, leaving the hound sitting beside his mother. If anyone spoke in the next few minutes, Sunny was unaware of it. He fell into a kind of daze as he watched the car drive away, dust billowing at its wheels. He could not begin to take in the situation in which he'd found himself. An all-too-familiar feeling of loss crept up within him, and before he knew it, he was letting out a mournful howl. After all his fears of being forced to choose, he'd now lost both his master, and his beautiful Dash. At dawn, Dash returned as she always did to Sunny's Bronx home, only to be met by an eerie quiet where she might have expected a clattering of paws on concrete and Sunny's excited baying voice. Confused by his not rushing out to greet her as he always had, Dash waited around for a while before leaving, ready to return again and again until their paths crossed. Perhaps, she wondered, his human had tired of his wanderings and was now keeping him under lock and key. Or maybe his master had taken him out for the day. Come the next day, there was still no sign of Sunny. Dash missed him, and struggled to bite back feelings of fear and uncertainty. This absence was out of character for a dog who thrived on the time he spent with Dash, and it gave her the uneasy feeling that something was wrong. Their bond was so strong; surely Sunny was not purposely avoiding her? Several more days passed, then a week, and the fading scent of Sunny that used to hang around his place had Dash fearful. Something didn't feel right, not at all. Finally, unable to take it anymore, Dash broke into the old yard, desperate to find some sign that Sunny hadn't disappeared into thin air. There was no rusted food bowl, no kennel, not even the busted tennis ball that he used to play with. Dash felt her heart catch in her throat. Somewhere from deep within herself she knew that Sunny was gone. A wave of grief rushed over her, and tears prickled her eyes. She should have known it would never end well; she was a fool, plain and simple. But what had happened to her beloved Sunshine? Had his master taken away, or… had the accident-prone dog finally run out of lucky escapes from under the wheels of cars? Dash's legs gave way as she imagined Sunny lying broken and alone on the side of some road. She gave a haunting cry of despair. After weeks of pure bliss with the dog she'd been certain would be her soul mate and closest companion for the rest of her days, coming down to the depths of heartache was nothing short of devastating. The setting sun gave an orange glow to the hills and trees, while a slight chill simultaneously fell upon them. Out on his original mistress' front porch, Sunny lay between his father, a handsome coonhound by the name of Quirk, and Quarry. He was listless. For weeks and months, he'd longed to have this life back; he'd have given anything to return to this place. But it wasn't like the old days now; Sunny felt an emptiness growing in him. Quarry licked her lips, distressed by the change in her son. \"You seem so low, Sunshine,\" she said gently. \"You must miss your friend very much, but it will be easier in time.\" Sunny looked at his mother, his expression sad. \"Maybe. If I knew how, I'd go back to her, but it was a long drive and I don't know the way. I don't even have an idea of how far it is on foot. I just don't know what to do.\" \"If it's meant to be, you'll find the way,\" said Quirk. \"I don't know that your mother and I would be any help, but we'll offer guidance and support wherever we can.\" Quarry nodded. \"We want you to be happy,\" she said, \"but only you can decide what that looks like.\" Laying his head back down, Sunny continued to wrestle with his thoughts and feelings. He knew one thing for certain, though, he had a heavy choice on his shoulders, and whatever he did would mean letting go of something dear to him. Sunny closed his eyes. He could not ignore the feeling from deep within; the feeling that a piece of his heart had been torn from him.[Chapter 12] Sunny paced up and down the fence, his troubled mind pushing him to take the plunge and begin a perilous journey to what he now realised was his home, but at the same time holding him back. He had no road sense, no idea of the way back, and a looming fear of the unknown. \"You'd find your way, you know,\" said Quarry, who had been watching him. She walked over and nuzzled her son's shoulder as he skidded to a stop. \"You need to start to trust yourself.\" Sunny whined. \"The only way I know is to follow the biggest roads in the general direction… but those cars are so fast; it scares the hell outta me.\" He hated himself for being so cowardly. \"Dash coulda done it, but I don't have the street smarts.\" Quarry felt for her son, but was certain he was selling himself short. He might be lacking in street smarts, but she knew that he was an intelligent young dog. \"You know what they say; there's more than one way to skin a cat. If you face your fears, you may realise that you can work around those stumbling blocks of yours.\" \"Are you trying to get rid of me?\" \"I'm trying to help you be happy. Only you can know what will do that for you, but you've got to go for whatever it is.\" More and more, Sunny felt a certainty that he simply had to try. He thought constantly about Dash, and how distressed she'd be by his sudden disappearance. For all she knew, he could be dead. Even if he hadn't wanted to go back and live in the city forever, he couldn't leave her fearing the worst- she didn't deserve to live with that. For Dash, he'd find his way. He had to go, and he had to go now, before doubts clouded his mind once more. \"I'm going,\" Sunny said confidently. He turned to his mother, his expression filled with love and appreciation. \"Tell Dad I'll be back sometime, but I'll have Dash with me.\" Quarry was taken aback by the suddenness of her son's departure, but would, of course, support him nonetheless. \"I will, but you better fill your stomach before you set off. You don't know when you'll find your next good meal.\" So, Sunny ate until he could eat no more, filling his belly with what would be his last meal of kibble, for he was now to be a stray. We wriggled and writhed, tugging at his collar with his forelegs until it finally came over his head. Sunny placed the collar at his mother's feet. \"You should keep this. I want a part of me to stay here. I dunno if I'd have realised just how much I had with Dash until I was taken away, so maybe this was the best thing that could have happened.\" Quarry and Sunny exchanged tender licks, and with Quirk walking in just in time, so did he. It was bittersweet, but Sunny knew now that returning to Dash and that enormous, frightening city was what he had to do. With a deep breath, Sunny crawled under the lowest railing in the fence and took the first step on his long journey home. The cold grey days perfectly complimented how Dash was feeling; downright miserable. The most plausible explanation for Sunny's disappearance was that he'd simply been killed on the streets, and Dash was shattered, convinced that she'd brought about the death of someone she'd come to care deeply about. She couldn't bring herself to talk about it, and she was left in a private storm of grief and guilt that no one could penetrate. Her only remedy for this pain was to remain busy and active. This was Jellybean's sons' first winter, and Dash would be damned if she was going to lose anyone else. She was a machine; every waking hour was spent searching for food to build up their reserves, and going through trash for anything soft that could improve the warmth of their shelter. Both Klaus and Jellybean has suffered devastated losses of their own before, and were sensitive to their beloved leader's needs. If Dash didn't want to talk about Sunny, they would not push her, but they were there if ever she needed a shoulder or two to cry on. If Dash did cry, though, she did it when there was no one else around. Laying down a large scrap of pizza down on the food pile, Dash sighed. She felt little enthusiasm for anything, and no one's efforts to cheer her had achieved much. Talking to Sunny about absolutely anything had been effortless and easy, and now, feeling as vulnerable as she ever had, that rock she'd come to depend on was gone. She knew now that she'd been selfish. Trying to make a street dog out of someone who clearly wasn't one had, in the end, cost a dear friend his life, and it was a hard burden to live with. She'd loved Sunny, been in love with him, but it had done neither of them any good in the end. \"Knock, knock!\" came a voice that was jovial- if forced. Dash heaved a heavier sigh. \"Morning, Bandit.\" She turned to see her elder brother, a dog with whom she was close, but who nonetheless was intruding on her self-enforced solitude. Bandit walked over tentatively, concern for his sister obvious in his face. \"You're eating all right, then?\" he asked, noting the small pile of food that Dash had been tending to. \"Those growing pups need to keep their strength up. This is gonna be a big few months for them.\" Dash said, and then realised that Bandit, unusually, was alone. \"Where's Pepper got to?\" Bandit's mate usually hung off him like a limpet, so her absence was strange indeed. \"She'll be around,\" he said with a shrug. \"I figured we could talk better if there was no one joining in.\" As Dash had expected, Bandit had taken it upon himself to play grief counsellor. It was sweet, and she appreciated it, but talking was still too painful. She lay down, deciding that she might as well try and enjoy her brother's company. It wasn't as if she couldn't shut any conversation down if things began to get uncomfortable. Dash knew she had to at least try to start moving on… if nothing else, her family needed her. Bandit took the hint to lie down in a comfortable spot and stretch out. \"Thanks, sis,\" he said. \"I know you probably want to be left alone, but I can't bear to see you hurtin' like this. I want you to know that I care.\" \"I know that,\" Dash said quietly. If there was anyone she could talk to about this, it was Bandit. When he was a young dog of six months old, his beloved Pepper had simply vanished without a trace, and for months, it seemed more than likely that she'd met an untimely end. Bandit had been in pieces, which was only exacerbated when he then lost his elderly friend, Einstein, as well. In those days, Dash and Bandit were the only two in the litter still living at home, and she saw him through what had been the hardest times of his life. As much as anyone could, Bandit understood what she was feeling. \"This must have been what you felt.\" \"I expect so,\" he said, kindly. \"But it gets better. I mean, it still hurts, but eventually it won't be on your mind all the time. I know it sounds naive, but you don't know for certain what happened; so, it will only hurt you more if you don't try and find happiness somewhere else.\" \"And ruin someone else's life?\" Dash said with a dark chuckle. \"Me being happy hasn't done anyone any favours… least of all Sunshine. Besides, I really don't feel I deserve anything less than what I'm feeling. He would have stayed safe in his yard if it wasn't for me.\" Bandit shrugged. \"I don't think he would. He wasn't even in his yard when you met him. Sunny was a broken dog when this all started, and you made him happy. Even… even if the worst did happen, I don't think he would have changed anything. His life was better with you in it. And you should be proud, not guilty.\" Dash felt tears coming, and she looked down at her paws, embarrassed. Deep within her, she knew that what Bandit said was true. Grieving the loss was one thing, but the time she and Sunny had spent together meant the world to her… and it had meant the world to him too. \"Damn, Brat,\" Dash said, her voice cracking with emotion. \"When did you get so wise? You can't have picked it up from Pepper.\" \"I'm just full of surprises, ain't I?\" Dash smiled in spite of everything. Acknowledging that her guilt was irrational felt like a big step forward. Learning to live with the loss, however, would take much longer. Bandit got up and came over to lick his sister's face. \"Just hang in there, okay? I'll help you however I can- and Pepper will too. You're gonna get through this, girl.\" Breaking into a run, Sunny saw the road fork off, and the general store and petrol station come into view. This, he'd decided, was his best shot at finding a ride to the big city. If he waited at the gas stop, sooner or later a large vehicle with somewhere to hide on would come by, and in his experience, most cars were going towards the Big Apple. The air held a definite chill, and Sunny hoped his ride would appear soon; keeping moving seem to him to be the best way of fighting the cold. He crouched behind a row of gas bottles, and waited. Sunny watched cars come and cars go. The strong smell of gasoline that hung in the air was not pleasant for the hound's sensitive nose. He shivered. The cold was definitely getting worse, and his mind wandered back to the comfortable home that his parents had almost certainly retreated to. This would not be an enjoyable journey, but that meant little when the end goal of reuniting with Dash. The rumbling of a truck caught Sunny's attention. That thing was big enough that he could hide in the back, and more importantly, it appeared to be going in the right direction. He waited until the driver left the truck to pay, and then jumped into the back, where he crouched nervously. Sunny held his breath as the driver returned, but after a long few seconds, the engine started and the truck set off… with the stowaway unnoticed. There was nothing more for him to do, but to hunker down and make sure the scenery he passed looked familiar. It seemed he was on his way… he could only hope that his sense of direction wouldn't fail him now. Though he didn't dare to lift his head too high in case he was spotted, Sunny kept a constant focus on his surroundings as the truck drove along. After about half an hour of this, he saw a glimpse of water, and it made his heart lurch. He knew the way home; all he had to do was follow the river. Sunny had to make the rest of his long journey on foot, but that meant taking a literal leap of faith, right out the back of the truck. He gulped, looking down at the road whizzing by below him. His poor attempts at car surfing even in slower speed traffic had led him to being a devout pedestrian, but this was a stunt that couldn't be avoided. Suddenly panicking that if he hesitated too long he'd lose the river, Sunny threw his fears to one side and jumped. The hound tumbled roughly over his side and into the bushes on the side of the road. The hard impact with the tarmac had grazed his shoulder on one side, and his loin on the other, but he was so exhilarated that the pain barely registered. If that gutsy move was anything to go by, he'd somehow hold his own with Dash's gang of street dogs. Sunny shook himself, and took off at a run back until he heard the flow of water. Having found the Hudson, all he had to do now was follow its trail until he reached the places he'd spent that wonderful day out with Dash. Pleased with himself, he stopped to lap up some water. It was cold, and gave an unpleasant kick to his insides, but Sunny knew he had to keep himself well for the journey. And so, Sunny walked, and he walked, and he walked some more. His eagerness to get home helped the first few hours fly by, but gradually, his paws became sore, and he the cold chill harder to overcome. He was thankful for the good meal he'd had before heading off, for he was already feeling a bit peckish from the relentless march onwards. To stop and rest would feel wrong; he had momentum now, and if he just kept going, it would be no time at all before his surroundings became familiar. Three more hours passed, then four, and then, with the sky now completely dark, five. Unable to drag his aching paws any further, Sunny collapsed beneath a tree. He shivered violently in the cold night air. Even after all that walking, nothing at all looked familiar. It was only Sunny's trust that the river was one and the same as the one he'd sat beside with Dash that prevented him from panicking. He was far from home now- both his homes. Too drained to even be frightened by his utter aloneness and distance from all things familiar, Sunny lay down his head and closed his eyes. If he could just get some solid sleep in spite of the cold, he might have the energy to finish his trek by sundown the next day. That thought; the thought of curling up with Dash, and Jellybean and Klaus, and the boys, kept him optimistic. However long it took, he was going to get there. Pouring rain woke Sunny late that night, and the drenched and freezing hound was left scrambling for a dry place to huddle. It was a task he discovered was futile, and all he could do was tuck in behind a looming tree root and take what little shelter the cover offered him. By the time the run rose, the rain had reduced to a light drizzle, but Sunny was already chilled to the bone and shaking like a leaf. The urge to get moving was strong after a long and miserable night; he needed to be making progress, otherwise the fear of his situation might finally hit. As long as he kept in trotting along the river's edge, he could hold onto the happy vision of his reunion with his lover, and so stay strong. As far as Sunny could see was trees and wilderness, and he knew he'd have to keep up a good pace if he was to reach the city by nightfall. Another night alone in cold isolation away from everything familiar was something he'd do everything within his power to avoid. He kept his pace steady, trotting onwards, and so beating the winter chill that was otherwise inescapable. A breakfast stop became unavoidable, as the hounds painfully rumbling stomach began to be a distraction from his mission. Besides, he thought, it might do him good to break up the journey. Keeping on in the general direction of the river flow, Sunny put his nose to the ground and allowed his dangling ears to direct scents towards his face. To his delight, he realised that there were rabbits nearby. Trusting his ability to find the river once more, he followed his powerful nose deeper into the forested bank. When Sunny emerged once more from the bushes, he had the limp brown form of a spring rabbit hanging proudly from his jaws. Hungrily, he wolfed down the meal, inhaling fur and leaving a flurry of fluff by the edge of the Hudson. The satisfied hound looked around and, delighted, took in the sight of buildings, pylons, concrete and steel. There were more humans here, and that meant he was getting closer. Though human activity had become more prominent surrounding the river, Sunny trotted on and on, without anything familiar in sight. He wondered if he'd underestimated the distance, but still he kept on going, even as the rain fell harder and thunder rumbled. Even fit as he was, Sunny had to stop and rest after four hours at his relentless pace. After his power-nap though, he was once again trotting forward, his face set with determination. To his dismay, the river proved not to be a straight route; it twisted around on itself, and valuable time was wasted where he could have cut across. The risk of losing his way was enough to keep him on the safest path he knew, so he could not bring himself to let that steadily flowing river out of his sight. The trees he walked through now were not the bushy evergreens he'd sheltered beneath upriver, but bare and skeletal… unfriendly almost. Then the banks became bare, with steel and concrete becoming ever more prominent in the landscape. He was getting closer, heading in the right direction, but Sunny's heart sank along with the sun as night fell on New York. He'd come so far, but he'd yet to see anything at all familiar to him. Resigned to the fact that he'd be enduring another lonely night, and this time with even less shelter from the wind and rain, he trudged forward, now keeping an eye out for somewhere less exposed to spend the night. And then, finally- finally, a sense of recognition came to him. He'd come onto a power plant, with two towering chimneys, and beside this structure, across the railway line was a small, green park. Sunny remembered this place- it was here that he and Dash had stopped for a drink in the river before turning back to the city the very day before he'd been taken so far away. Suddenly, there was no question. He was going home, and he was going home tonight, come hell or high water. Laughing with mirth and utter relief, Sunny collapsed onto his belly and rested his weary paws. From here, he knew exactly the way back to his beloved Dash. Though he settled down for a nap to recharge his batteries, the road ahead was easy, and he'd be back where he belonged before the night was out. \" Hello?\" came a voice, piercing the quiet of the night. Protective of her family, Dash woke almost within an instant, and sat up, alert. Beside her, Klaus lifted his head and gave a thunderous growl. \"Who there?\" Klaus boomed, waking Jellybean and the boys. In the dark, neither he, nor Dash could really see this intruder. Dash's hackles stood up. \"Whoever you are, back off! We got pups here, you don't wanna test us,\" she growled. But at that instant, she could have sworn she recognised a comforting scent… one of a friend. \"Dashie? Dash, it's me!\" came the voice again. It was tired, sounding almost pleading for rest. More than that, Dash knew that voice. \"Sunshine?\" Dash gasped. Suddenly wide awake, she rushed forward with no fear… this was no intruder, not at all. She was vaguely aware of her friends breaking into excited barking, but all she could really hear was the sound of claws on cement, as Sunny came towards her, and then the swishing of his frantic tail wagging. Coming close, she could make out his sweet face, even in the dark. The two dogs came together, squirming, licking, weeping, their tails waving in wild circles as they reunited. Dash pressed herself close to Sunny, and he draped a foreleg over her back, holding her, not wanting to let go. They fell down to the ground, tangled together. Neither of them could find the words, but then, none were really needed. Sunny was a street dog now, part of a gang, and he was home. Dash pawed at the ground, panting heavily. Over a year had passed since she took the country hound Sunshine as her mate, and their closeness had only grown. Her swollen middle gave away the development in their relationship, that they were on the brink of becoming parents to a litter of their own. Now in heavy labour, the pain had become so intense that Dash feared her little body would be torn apart. But still she kept pushing, knowing that she'd soon be rewarded with the best moment of her life. She whined and closed her eyes before heaving again. Come on, little one, you're almost there. Come on… And then Dash felt a relief from the pressure that had built up and a wet lump slide down under her tail. She instinctively leaned in to clean the pup and help it breathe. In the panic to bring the child to life, she couldn't really take it in, but after a moment the puppy gave a first gasping breath. Dash felt tears well up in her eyes. She had a beautiful baby girl! \"Oh, my little angel- hello, darling!\" Dash gushed, and she licked the puppy some more. She was tiny; tiny and perfect. The pup's sleek, wet fur was brown, seemingly near in colour to her father's. Dash smiled. She couldn't wait to share the child with Sunny, who would be over the moon. He'd gone to fetch some food for the mother-to-be, and would hopefully be back in time to catch the rest of the delivery. While the pains continued- there were of course, puppies still to come- it was not so intense, and for the time being, Dash could focus on her new daughter. She rolled onto her side, offering her nipples to the baby puppy. To her surprise, the pup needed little encouragement, and soon latched on. Dash beamed with pride; she was providing for her child, and there could be no greater honour. She kept leaning down to lick and kiss the puppy, already swept up in the motherly love she felt. This was truly everything she'd hoped for. \"Dash!\" Sunny cried as he scrambled into the den. \"Dash, are you all ri-?\" He fell quiet as his eyes landed on the fat little puppy by his mate's side. \"Congratulations, Sunshine,\" Dash said softly, \"you've got a little girl.\" Sunny gave a great yip of joy and rushed to lay down with Dash and the pup. \"She's beautiful… she's so, so beautiful.\" He gave the infant a tender lick, and felt tears forming in his eyes. A warm tongue against his face had him look up. \"Oh, Dash, I love you.\" \"I love you too. And I love her, our little girl.\" It was not long before Dash was straining once more, and Sunny could only look on, helpless, as she went through the pain of labour. He licked her forehead as she came out of a particularly strong contraction. \"You've got to be close now, Dashie,\" Sunny whispered to her. \"You're doing great.\" The next pup was another girl, whose fur was a golden brown. Sunny had been wide-eyed as she'd entered the world, and was quick to help Dash attend to Girl Number Two. \"We should name them,\" Dash said. \"They deserve to have names.\" \"Did you manage to narrow down to a couple of favourites?\" Dash looked at her girls. \"I think goldie girl is an 'Ella'.\" \"That's pretty,\" said Sunny, nodding his approval. \"I actually like the name 'Daisy', how about that for the other one?\" \"I like it.\" Dash beamed, even while she felt a familiar pain beginning to ripple through her once more. The third puppy was in no real hurry to greet the world, and his parents were beginning to worry when he finally made his grand entrance. \"We've got a boy!\" Dash cried, between the kisses she was showering the pup with. \"Jack?\" Sunny suggested. \"Sounds good to me; Daisy, Ella and Jack. Our beautiful babies.\" It would not be long before the protective Klaus returned to Dash's side, and for the exciting news to draw Jellybean and her sons back to welcome the long-awaited new members of the family. In the meantime, though, Sunny and Dash could enjoy these quiet moments together, relishing the knowledge that their fight to stay together had been utterly worth it. That chapter in their story was all over; and in Daisy, Ella, and Jack, a new one, brighter than they could have imagined, was just beginning.

Goodnight Jeremy Jenny said\" and she kissed him on his cheek oh uh goodnight Jenny he stuttered as he felt his heart speed up I think I am in love Jeremy thought to himself as he made his way out of Jennys room downstairs out the front door and into the limo. And Jenny was sitting with her cheeks turning pink I think I am in love she mumbled, and then she smiled.[Chapter 10] Over the next few weeks Jenny and Jeremys friendship grew stronger\" they did everything together but suddenly Jenny had this nervous feeling that someone was following her everywhere and that she was constantly being watched everywhere she went even at school and at home she didn.t feel safe anywhere anymore. Whats wrong with me Jenny said to herself as she looked around while she waited for the school bus one morning. Jenny get hold of yourself nobody is watching you and nobody is following you she told herself but she couldn.t get rid of the feeling that someone has been stalking her and that frightened her badly. HONNNK Jenny jumped in fear but it was just the school bus and she climbed aboard good morning Ted Jenny said to the driver\" and good morning to you too Jenny he replied. Hey Jenny over here Jeremy called I was saving you a seat he said and Jenny sat next to him and hugged him good morning she replied after she buckled her seatbelt I have a present for you Jenny he said as he took a small box out of his coat pocket and opened it and Jenny gasped as Jeremy held up a silver chain necklace with a pink heart shaped pendant and when Jenny looked closer at the pendant she saw her name engraved on it Jeremy how did you ever afford this Jenny asked. Well your parents helped with that part. I picked it out and they took care of the rest Jeremy said\" I love it thank you Jenny said as she tried the necklace on its beautiful and its a perfect fit Jeremy replied Jeremy you are the sweetest boy in New York Jenny told him as she laced her fingers with his and they both blushed and smiled shyly at each other. But Jenny was right to feel frightened because unknown to her Jeremys mother had some of the men on her late husbands payroll watching and following her wherever she went and she had worse things in store for Jenny. Jeremy really is the sweetest boy Jenny thought as she looked at the gorgeous necklace he bought which was around her neck. Oh Jenny you might want to take that off and put it away Jeremy said yes you're right somebody might try to steal it Jenny replied as she removed the necklace and put it in her coat pocket.[Chapter 11] Jeremy is here and Winston is waiting in the limo Mrs Foxworth\" called to her daughter okay mom Jenny replied\" as she came out of her room in a blue dress and black flats with her hair in french braids with purple ribbons in them and went downstairs.

The best thing about this restaurant is it has a band and dance floor Jenny said\" as she laid her head on Jeremys shoulder and laced their fingers together and they smiled at each other well here we are Winston said as he opened the door to let the children out ladies first Jeremy said and Jenny giggled you are so very polite she told him\" as he climbed out and stood next to her and they entered the restaurant can I help you asked a lady with blond hair yes reservation for Foxworth and Sykes Jenny said\" oh yes follow me the lady said and she led them to their table and Jeremy pulled out Jennys chair and she sat and he pushed her chair in Jenny sighed he is such a well mannered boy she thought as a waiter handed them their menus and they quickly decided on what they were going to order I will have the filet mignon Jenny said\" and I would like the steak and mashed potatoes Jeremy said\" ok the waiter said and what would you like to drink he asked\" I would like a chocolate milk please Jenny said\" that sounds good please make that two chocolate milks please Jeremy said\" allright the waiter said as he went to the kitchen to give their orders to the cook Jeremy ever since I met you my life has been wonderful before I met you I didn.t have many friends except Oliver and Georgette and I used to get so lonely sometimes Jenny said as a tear trickled down her cheek and Jeremy wiped it away with his napkin please don.t cry he said as he held her hand I will be here for you always thank you she replied and she smiled at him. Here are your meals the waiter said and set their plates down and gave them their drinks. Enjoy he told them and they began to eat ten minutes later they were finished so what do we do now Jeremy asked how about a dance Jenny said and pointed to the dance floor okay but I have to warn you I am not that good of a dancer Jeremy said as she led him out on the floor don.t worry I know you will do fine Jenny said as she put her hands on his shoulders and he put his hands on Jennys waist and they began to sway slowly side to side. See you can do it Jenny told him and he smiled wow you're right I don.t believe it the last time I tried to dance I ended up giving my partner black and blue feet because I kept stepping on them Jeremy said and he and Jenny laughed oh no I lost track of time Jenny said as she looked at the clock on the wall you're right Jeremy said as he looked at his watch it was eight seventeen and their movie started at eight p.m. well so much for the movie Jeremy said disappointedly\" wait we can still have our after dinner movie Jenny said\" oh right at your house Jeremy replied yes Jenny told him twenty minutes later they were back at Jennys house and her parents agreed to let Jeremy spend the night because his mother was away on business again fortunately he had brought a change of clothes including his pajamas lets go change into our P.J.S Jenny said\" and the children went upstairs Jenny to her room and Jeremy to the guest room which was next to Jennys room and changed into his batman pajamas come on Jeremy Jenny said\" and he came out and there was Jenny in a pink ankle length nightgown and bunny slippers uh you have rabbits on your feet Jeremy said\" cute aren.t they she replied yes he agreed as they entered the living room so what movie should we watch Jeremy asked\" I've got it Jenny said as she selected a tape and put it in the vcr and pressed play oh cool E.T.

He didn.t see the smile on Jennys face nor did he hear the words I love you Jeremy Sykes come from the little girls mouth.[Chapter 12] Good morning Jenny Jeremy said\" as they met outside their rooms.

Wow Jenny you look very pretty he stammered' as he took her hand and they made their way to the limo where Winston was waiting. Ladies first Jeremy said\" as he opened the car door for her Jenny blushed you are such a gentlemen she replied\" as she entered the limo and Jeremy climbed in after her and shut the door.

Jenny took a look at Jeremy and she was amazed at how handsome he looked in his tuxedo you look very cute Jeremy she said\" ","Summary":" may 23rd 1989 It was Monday morning and 9 year old Jenny Foxworth was sitting in class when the doo"},{"Movie":"House of Wax","Title":"Stranded In A Ghost Town","Author":"BrunetteMarionette","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6879631","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I started writing this book two years ago now and finished it last year and I've done more books after that. This book is my baby, it was my first published fan fiction that I actually completed and at the time liked but rereading it I discovered that it lacked a lot of things for me. I thought it was very rushed with it only having 9 chapters and not very good ones at that but I do appreciate everyone's love and support when reading it. So I've decided to go back and delete the older chapters to make room for my new (and hopefully better) chapters, If you preferred the older version I'm sorry but I felt like this was a better version. Hopefully this edit and change goes smoothly but bare with me and keep reading, please. Thank you :D[Chapter 2] Carrying my box of fries and soda out of the Diner we had stopped at I grimace when I noticed a guy staring at me before sending a wink my way\"Eurgh\" I groaned in disgust as I sat next to my two best friends who were looking at me questioningly. \"Major creepo\" I mutter as the two girls turn to see the guy still looking over to our table before bursting out laughing at me as I put a fry into my mouth \"yeah yeah haha\" I roll my eyes with a small smirk not even really annoyed. I notice Paige looking through the paper again \"Anything good?\" I ask her dipping my fry into her ketchup making her glare at me before pointing to an ad with her finger \"There's a place in tribeca for 3000\" Carly sighed when we looked at her and shrugged looking upset. \"That's too expensive. The money I saved up wont cover two months rent. I'm gonna have to work every second I'm not in class until graduation\"Carly sighed sadly looking defeated and ready to give in before she even started. Drinking a little of my soda I raised my eyebrow at Carly who was usually so headstrong \"Carly, don't even think about not going\" Paige said threateningly as if there was something she could do about it if Carly had changed her mind. \"I'm not.\" Carly told us hurriedly shaking her head reassuring us a I smiled over to her with the straw from my soda between my teeth as I continue to slurp as the sugar filled drink. \"You know how proud we are of you\" Paige said excitedly motioning to the two of us which we were she had worked hard to get this internship and we wanted her to get the best out of it. Carly laughed when I gave her a thumbs up letting go of the red straw \"You got it dude!\" I joked as a blush spread of her cheeks \"It's just an internship\" Carly told us shyly smiling even though we all she was really excited but didn't want to show it especially with her and Wade not on the same page about the move to New York. \"At instyle magazine\" Paige and I squealed in unison before looking at each other and linking fingers with a laugh \"Total jinx\" Paige told me as Carly shook her head at our antics. \"Or would you rather stay at the waffle house as a waitress forever?\"Paige said teasingly as I gasped thinking about where her life would be if she let this opportunity go. \"Yeah and you could have like 8 children before the age of 30 and live in a little motor home with no job and ...\" Paige nudged me out of my anxious rambling by shoving a fry in my mouth as Carly giggle at me\"No, Thanks\". \"Yeah\"We all laughed looking at the covers of instyle magazines as Carly showed us what she would love to be doing if she was kept on after her internship and not just fetching coffee for the staff like she thinks she'll be doing. We all looked up when Wade walked up to the table giving us all a dimpled smile \"Hey, babe\" he greeted giving Carly a kiss on the side of her head as she looked into his eyes with adoration \"\"Hi\". \"Hormones on parade\" I sang as I pretended to still my fingers down my throat as Paige leaned into me and we both started to laugh when Carly threw her straw wrapper at us as they both blushed \"Oh yeah like two you can talk\". I grinned as Wade gave me a playful glare \"Bitch\" shaking my head I knew he was just playing so I retaliated \"Jerk\" Wade wrapped and arm around Carly as she rolled her eyes knowing I could do this all day and I was a bad influence on her southern boyfriend. \"So there were these two drunk rednecks wrestling in the bathroom\" Wade told us with a big grin on his face he was pretty much used to that happening \"Really\" Carly asked teasingly as I looked at him questioningly \"Was it over a hot dog? I bet it was over a hot dog..or beer. I'd fight a redneck for beer\" I told them seriously as they all looked at me with knowing grins. \"There's no rednecks in New York\" Paige told Wade seriously as his smile dropped off her face and the light mood was gone as Wade shifted uncomfortably \"What the fuck?\" I whispered giving Paige a semi glare for putting them on the spot like that but Carly just plainly glared at our blonde friend. \"No there's not\" Wade muttered clearing his throat at the very awkward silence that was now occurring at Paige's oh so delightful comment, We sat in silence for a few seconds before Paige realized what she had done and got up with a smile. \"Im gonna see what Blake's doing he seems to like that car more than me nowadays.\" Paige said jokingly as she tried to ease the tension\"Yeah watch out for rednecks on your way over there\" I told her sarcastically as she glared at me and stomped away. Both Wade and Carly looked at me with small smiles but made no attempt at conversation and I guessed it was my time to leave them too \"I'm gonna go see if nick and Dalton are behaving\" I said rolling my eyes teasingly knowing that Nick and Dalton are never behaving they're always causing trouble or up to no good especially when they're together. I got up and looked around but there was no sign of the two mischievous men until I looked back over to the diner and sighed wondering what they could have been up to \"Hey what laws you two breaking now?\" I asked teasingly, raising my eyebrow as they both looked at me trying to seem innocent. \"What makes you think were doing anything bad\" Nick questions as he puts his hands around my waist and pulls me in for a kiss \"Yeah don't you have faith in us any more Ash?\" Dalton asks with a puppy dog look on his face as I pretended to think. \"Nope not since the car incident\" I said to them as they both looked at me equally as guilty we were the only ones who knew the truth about the car theft that Nick was jailed for. \"Still haven't let that go huh?\" Nick asked rubbing the back of his head looking at me defeated as I just turned and walked back outside with the two of them following me knowing that I didn't want to talk about it \" Idiots \".[Chapter 3] Passing a homeless man sat on the ground I dropped a few coins into his cup before catching Carly's eye and she gestured that it was ok to join them again \"How you doing? Hello.\" I heard Dalton mutter as he took out his camera and started filming us. \"Ah\" Nick said and I turned around to see him kicking the cup out of the homeless guy's hand \"What's up, crow man\" Dalton mock as he pointed his camera to the man \"Get a job.\" Nick hissed to the man as he drank from him beer bottle before looking at me questioningly seeing my glare. \"Classy Nicholas \" I scathed as I sat down opposite Carly again as Nick sat sideways on the bench and pulled me between his legs so Dalton could fit on the same side of the table as us. I watched Dalton giggling and filming me so I poked my tongue out and crossed my eyes \"Nice Ash\" he grinned knowing other than Nick I was the only one who didn't mind being filmed. \"What do you think guys? Gonna be sweet games tomorrow, huh?\" Wade said looking at us trying to bond but failing miserably, he always goes out of his way to try and be friends with us all but the others don't really care for him much but I didn't mind him. \"Yeah\" Nick and I spoke aloud but Nick's wasn't as sincere as mine he was here purely because I was here and because Blake posted his bail, also the fact that he thinks Wade has a wondering eye but that's just Nick being insecure. Dalton starting speaking gibberish trying mock Wade who was beginning to get pissed off with Nick and Dalton he had tried to be nice but they didn't want it so they mock and pissed him off with every chance they got instead. \"Dalton, please don't film me\" Carly squeaked when she realized what Dalton was doing \"What?\" Dalton replied trying to act innocent but still obviously pointing the camera in Carly's direction making me smirk. his crush on Carly was way too obvious to everyone but Carly herself \"Please\" Carly begged Dalton making Wade's jaw clench and this was the reason he didn't like Dalton he knew that D was sweet on Carly and hated that he was trying to break them up. \"I'm not filming right now\" Dalton tried to cover for himself by lying \"The red light's on idiot\" I exclaimed to him laughing loudly when Dalton realized he got caught out and his face became the same colour as the light on his camera. \"Come on, put the camera down\" Nick muttered reaching across me to shove Dalton's camera down shocking me that he actually helped Carly for once usually he would just let her deal with Dalton's annoying antics herself. \"You know she doesn't like having people up in her face. She folds under pressure\" Nick mused tauntingly whilst Carly and Wade glared at him, their glares were anger but mine was annoyance I had been in the middle of these petty fights for years now. \"You got something to say to me?\" Carly asked boldly as Wade gave me a worried look knowing I could stop the both of them if I tried. \"Meow sibling fight\" I said light heartedly and Carly softly glared at me knowing what I was trying to do. \"No, I think you've already spoken enough for the both of us, don't you? Nick said to her callously as he stood \"Nick!\" I called out in shock as he walked off, I love my boyfriend but Carly was my best friend too and their sibling fights were crazy. Carly just nodded sadly and didn't say anything else, not letting the tears I knew were there out we had all heard this argument before we had all argued over this too many times to know nothing was going to change this. \"You guys are lame. I'm out of here. See ya\" Dalton said stealing some of Carly's fries and walking off making me breath a laugh in disappointment thinking he should know better he was the cause of most of this. I looked at Carly who was being consoled by Wade \"I'm sorry\" I whispered knowing my apologies would make it any better \"You're not the one who should be sorry\" Carly muttered as she grabbed my hand. \"No but it's still wrong I know you didn't do anything and...\" I started but Carly squeezed my hand looking worried \"Calm Ash... you're letting this get to you\". I nodded and pulled my hand away before standing \"I'm gonna go cool down\" I told the couple who both nodded and looked at my sympathetically as I walked away from the table wrapping my arms around myself as I pulled my hoodie closer. \"Baby\" I heard Nick's voice call as he tried to get my attention \"Not now\" I told him but he grabbed my arm and pulled me away from sight when he saw my face he knew what was happening. \"Can't you be more nice to your sister, please ?\" I begged him and I saw the sadness in his eyes \"I can't do this any more\" I told him seriously as he looked at me shocked \"do this as in us?\" he asked putting his arms beside my head on the wall I was leaning against. I shook my head with a sigh seeing his upset face \"no I mean I can't keep being the mediator between my best friend and my boyfriend\" I hissed as he looked at me guiltily he knew how bad their arguments could get. \"Baby we've been through this before she's the good twin…\" he started and I looked at him annoyed it was the same excuse every time and that's just what it was an excuse, he didn't want people knowing the truth that he was actually a really good person and not this persona he puts on. \"And you're the evil one yada yada yada I know\" I said to him angrily knowing that this badass persona had cost his future, he had everything taken away from him including his scholarship. This persona had him not caring about how his life will end up, he's always on the wrong side of the law but that's something was had in common, we both have prior convictions but my demons were darker and meaner than Nick's. He started to laugh \"God I love you\" he whispered as he picked me up by the back of my legs making them wrap around his waist as my arms entangled themselves around his neck \"Well someone has to\" I mutter back to him as our lips hovered over each others teasingly, Nick looked into my eyes with a look I had seen plenty of times throughout my life. Pity. I pulled his head closer into a rough kiss knowing that if I had left any more time I would have been lost in memories and flashbacks something I wasn't a fan of, Nick pushed the two of us into the wall behind me as he tighten his grip on my body getting a moan from me. \"fuck\" Nick groaned when I grinded my lower half into him as I felt myself getting lost in him \"Nick\" I fluttered when he began to kiss and nibbled my neck and collar bone he knew where my hot spot was and the bastard used it every time. I had both forgotten where we were until I heard Paige screaming making Nick and I pull back and look at each other confused until I heard her next words \"Dalton, put down that damn camera. God\". I started to laugh as Nick put me back down on the ground and we walked back around the diner hand in hand as I shouted to my crazy friend who was being threatened by an angry looking Paige \"Dalton you might wanna come back over here before Paige shoves that camera somewhere you don't want it to be!\"[Chapter 4] Dalton, Nick and I stood together waiting for everyone to be ready to leave when Blake called Nick over \"I'll be back\" he told me as I stood near Dalton as he showed me the video he got so far \"Yeah\" I called to Nick distracted. \"hey guys\" Carly sighed as she and Wade finally caught up to us as we stood by the cars \"You ok?\" I asked her as she and Wade had obviously been talking about something that had upset the two of them. \"Yeah, fine\" Carly told me putting her hands in her pockets with a tight smile \"You?\" she asked as I looked over to Nick who was walking back over to us \"I will be\" I replied quickly as Nick stood by us looking annoyed \"What's up?\" I questioned when he looked between Carly and Wade apprehensive. \"So we ready?\" Nick asked nodding to Wade's small car as he opened the door \"Wait, wait what do mean are 'we' ready?\" Carly questioned Nick looking confused as he sighed and moved away from the door. \"Blake's looking to get some so you've got 3 more passengers\" Nick told Wade and Carly giving them no choice as he got into the back of the car \"really Car?\" Wade whispered to Carly as he gave me sorry smile. \"We've got no choice Wade\" Carly muttered back as I crawled to the back seat of Wade's car before being squashed by Dalton \"Oh god\" I groaned as I felt myself being trapped in the middle of the two men. \"Everyone in?\" Carly asks before pushing the chair back and getting in as Wade started up the car silently he obviously wasn't a fan of us being in the car with him \"Blake's a dick\" I say aloud as everyone in the car laughs to themselves agreeing with me. I let out a yawn as I watched Wade's headlights illuminate everything outside we seemed to be in the middle of nowhere \"tired babe?\" Nick whispered to me as pulled my sleeves over my arms \"A little\" I answered shortly knowing there was no privacy in this car, Nick just smiled and put his arm up so I could hug myself into his chest. Closing my eyes I sighed happily when Nick started rubbing circles on my back as I pulled myself closer to him \" Record crowds are expected for college football's biggest game of the year as Louisiana and Florida...\" I turned myself back around to listen to the radio until Wade sighs and turns it down \"It's going to be packed tomorrow\" He tells Carly seeming frustrated, we haven't even bought the tickets yet. \"Really?\" Carly asks sounding disappointed but I don't think she really cared she was just going because Paige was going and Paige was only going because Blake was going, so really we're here in this tiny car on a road trip because of Blake. \"Speaking of packed my legs are killing me back here, man.\" Dalton groaned as he shifted around childishly kicking me in the process \"Ow damn it D\" I yelled I moved my leg away instinctively frowning at him. \"Sorry ash I didn't mean to kick ya\" Dalton apologized as he rubbed my hurt leg as I just smiled at him chuckling a bit knowing he didn't mean to hurt me \"Don't worry, man, its not Wade's fault his little hot wheels car only fits two.\" Nick said nastily as Carly glared over at him but Nick just looked away. Dalton started to laugh after Nick set him up to bash on Wade \"It's more like a shot wheels car, isn't it?\" Dalton says to Nick laughing again as the rest of us kept quiet I just breathed in deeply knowing this probably wasn't going to end well... again. \"What did you do, go to the barber shop and ask for a He-Man haircut?\" Dalton sniggered as I saw Wade's head shift a little but didn't fully turn to look at Dalton who was still laughing in my ear as Nick chuckled a little. I hit them both in the shoulders \"would you two stop it\" I whispered knowing that Wade could stop and throw us out of his car if he really wanted to and I didn't want to be in the middle of nowhere in the pitch black. \"Hey, why did you hit me?\" Dalton asked clueless holding his shoulder \"So you will get the message, stop being mean and close your mouth!\" I retorted getting annoyed being in the confined car space with people getting on each others nerves. As I was talking to Dalton I felt Nick smack my shoulder but not anywhere near the strength I had used \"Why did you just hit me?\" now I was just as clueless as Dalton was making Nick smirk at me \"So you will stop being mean to me and Dalton\" he said mimicking what I said \"Asshole\". \"he-man\" Dalton whispered to himself as he started laughing again \"classic\" I heard Wade sigh in frustration \"Shut up Dalton\" he finally told Dalton sticking up for himself but D just carried on. Dalton starting tapping mine and Nick's shoulders trying to get us to laugh with him which got very annoyingly D was like the annoying brother I never got to have \"D stop\" I told him but he was too far gone until Nick reached past me and hit him in the chest \"Ow, dude. You hurt me\" D muttered trying to laugh it off. I just shook my head as I watched as Wade picked up Carly's hand that she had put on his leg and kissed it making Carly smile widely \"What the hell is this?\" wade called out as we all groaned, the road was blocked and had been rerouted \"Oh man\" Dalton moaned as he began to shift and rub his legs again, I looked over to Nick to see he had drifted off with his hood up blocking us all out. \"This sucks\" Carly added as Wade followed wherever Blake was going \"So much for his little shortcut\" I huffed sarcastically I knew following Blake blindly was a bad idea most things Blake does is a bad idea. Wade started to speed up when the road got wider and we drove up along side Blake's car \"I hope he's not gonna get us lost\" wade muttered as he looked between the road and out of Carly's window \"Yeah, right\" Carly agreed sounding annoyed. As we drove next to Blake's car I could see Paige's head bobbing us and down by Blake's lap as he had pleasure written all across his face, I gasped and tapped Dalton who looked in the same direction I was and started laughing \"Damn! Yo, yo, wake up. Wake up\" Dalton called to Nick who opened his eyes annoyed. \"Oh my god\" I said as we all watched Paige in shock, Dalton took out his camera and started filming them \"look at her. Look! Caught on tape.\" He laughed as I pushed him disgusted with his filming them. Nick leaned forward and honked the horn twice making Paige's head shoot up and look at us in shock before slapping Blake's arm when she saw him smirking at us \"Oh my god! What are they doing?\" Carly laughed as she held up her hands to Paige who just shook her head. \"Is she flossing herself with that thing? Nick laughed from behind me as he breath tickled my ear making me smile glad that the atmosphere in the car had changed \"What are you doing?\" Carly giggled as we all continued to make fun of the couple who had been caught out \"Look at his face.\" Dalton sniggered when Blake looked at the boys and smirked. Paige caught me eye as a pink hue had taken over her face, I sent her a small wink making her blushed even deeper as I began to laugh again until my phone starting to ring so I looked at the caller id: Paige.[Chapter 5] Looking down at my phone confused I looked up to see Paige shaking her phone at me \"She's calling me\" I told Carly who turned around in her chair to face me \"Answer it!\" Carly exclaimed excitedly as she grinned at me. \"You are so busted\" I shouted jokingly when I answered the phone whilst trying batting away Dalton's hands from grabbing my cell phone \"Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm\" Paige defended weakly as she held up her lip balm to us as Wade tried to keep up with Blake's car. \"She dropped her lip balm\" I told everyone, covering the mouth piece of the phone as they looked at me expectantly \"Yeah right\" Wade called out making us all bust out laughing again at Paige's expense. \"So what's up\" I asked over the phone to Paige whilst leaning back into nick, who in return started to play with strands of my hair \"It's getting late. What do you want to do\" Paige says looking at Blake, It was weird talking to Paige and seeing her talk at the same time. \"Keep going, we don't even have tickets\" I could hear Blake tell her and her sighing annoyed \"Babe there's going to be a million scalpers there. Besides if we keep driving, there's no way I'll stay up for the game\" She said to Blake and I smirked knowing there was no way he'd say no to her. \"Why don't we just camp out? We're close enough.\" I said as the rest of the car agreed with me \"Yeah beer\" Dalton called turning his camera to me as I put my hand over his mouth trying to listen to Paige and Blake's conversation \"let's just pull over here. Come on. We'll wake up early\" Paige pleaded trying to convince Blake. \"Yeah all right\" Blake answered giving into Paige which wasn't shocking at all \"all right, were pulling over\". Paige told me as she looked over to me \"All right\" I nodded closing my phone before looking at Nick and kissing him. A sudden flash had Nick looking at me confused \"did you just take a picture of us kissing\" he asked as I laughed nodding, Blake honked his horn at us and pointed forward before driving in front of us again. We followed behind Blake's truck as he and Paige looked for somewhere for us to camp out for the night without getting into trouble, I put my head on nicks shoulder but he moved his arm and wrapped it around my shoulders again as I smiled and kissed his stubble. \"Hey, wax museum\" Wade said to Carly as we passed a wooden board for Trudy's house of wax \"You like that kind of stuff wade?\" Nick asked like he was interested but I think Carly and I both knew where this was going. \"Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes\" Wade answered sounding like he wasn't sure if his answer \"I guess if you like things pretending to be other things. Which you obviously do. Right, sis? Nick hissed as Carly looked back at him but said nothing. \"Where is he taking us?\" Carly sighed when we followed Blake over a wooden bridge \"Somewhere he can be alone with Paige\" I tell her with a smirk as she laughs nodding knowing how true that was. After stopping behind Blake's truck Carly and Wade pulled their seats forward so we could get out \"Your car sucks dude\" Nick told Wade as he got out and started to stretch We made it\" Dalton said in a dramatic voice as he stretched out too. Paige Ashley, come with me and we'll grab this stuff\" Carly called over to Paige and I from the back of Wade's car \"Here\" Carly muttered as she passed me a bag to carry as we walked to the front of Blake's car whilst the boys talk among themselves. \"Well?\" Carly asks looking at Paige expectantly and I suddenly remember the phone call I had gotten from a upset Paige a few days ago saying she was late \"I couldn't there's no point in freaking him out now\" Paige mumbled as Carly and I sighed putting down our bags. \"As opposed to when you find out you are pregnant?\" I deadpan as Paige turns and looks over to me vulnerably \"Guys, I'm not sure, okay? Paige whispers quietly, I rub her arm in comfort \"We just think you should have a conversation with him.\" Carly sighs as we both look at Paige carefully knowing how hard this must be for her. \"He's been looking forward to this stupid football game for months. I don't wanna ruin it for him by stating a fight\" Paige told us looking over to the boy quickly as Carly huffs \"Paige, he's not going to marry you. His parents won't let him\". Blake had been trying get his parent to let him ask Paige to marry him for a year but his parent's weren't as fond of Paige as we all were and due to the fact that Blake's parents are rich and pay for everything they won't let him marry her. \"Who says she wants to get married\" I argue seeing Paige's side of the conversation especially when I see how upset she looked, the 3 of us were all still in college barley functioning adults and Paige has to deal with this. \"I've been late before you guys, when I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay?\" Paige tells us as the boys start to get everything ready to camp with, Carly and I look at each other skeptically before nodding at Paige knowing we couldn't change her mind right now. \"Lets go get drunk!\" I yelled playfully to them picking the bag back up as Paige walks back over to Blake \"She's in denial\" Carly tells me as we stand looking at her with Blake \"Oh yeah girl's in way too deep\" I reply as I put the bag over my shoulder as Carly looks at me questioningly. \"So then why did you agree with her?\" she asks raising an eyebrow when I laughed \"Paige is usually a bitch so do you wanna disagree with a hormonal raging blonde?\" I joke as I follow Carly to the camp. \"We deal with you everyday\" Carly calls back with humor in her voice as I gaped in mock surprise behind her \"You'll be sorry when they name their first born after me\" I reply pushing her in the shoulder playfully as I walk past her to Nick.[Chapter 6] Carly, Paige and I sat by the fire pit which was basically just logs we had found the boys put up the 3 tents, looking over at them I sighed knowing that 3 tents means I would be sharing with Nick and Dalton \"Who forgets to bring a tent on a road trip?\" I ask my best friends as I take a drink from my beer bottle, my 3rd beer bottle. The two girls laughed knowing exactly who I was talking about but also knew I was joking \"he's like the puppy that follows you home and won't leave you alone\" I joked as I looked over to Dalton who was trying and failing to help the other boys. Frowning I failed to see Nick helping the others but my worry faded when I saw said love of my life walking over to the camp with his hands full with beer bottle and a chair, he lit up a smoke before he saw me looking at him and sent a wink my way making me smile. \"Yeah don't help us or nothing\" Dalton said sarcastically to Nick as he finished carrying stuff back and forth to the cars but Nick just waved him off as he continued to sit on his own isolating himself from our group. \"Oh Yeah\" I hear Blake call from inside his tent and turn to see him coming out with a football I snuck a glance over to Nick but he didn't move or try to join in, not that he had since he lost his football scholarship. Blake and Wade started teasing Dalton by not passing him the ball or throwing it over his head \"Pass it! Pass it!\" Dalton yelled as he ran to each man as they threw it back and forth. \"You don't wanna… Too slow, too slow!\" Blake laughed running around Dalton who was still trying to get the ball, Dalton was not one of the fast athletic type but he tried to fit in. Blake turned and tried to pass the ball back to Wade over Dalton's head but it was a little too high \"Touchdown-Ahh\" Wade called as he reached for the ball but it went over his head and it landed straight between Nick's feet \"Oh shit\" I muttered as Carly looked at me just as worried about what might happen next. Wade put his hands up silently asking for Nick to throw the ball back to him but Nick ignored him and pretending like he didn't even know the ball had come near him, Wade sighed and walked forward to the ball but Nick had dropped his cigarette and picked up the football. Nick launched the ball away from Wade and into Blake's chest harshly making him grimace quietly giving Nick a look \"Nice Arm, I can see why they gave you a scholarship\" Wade huffed with his hand on his hip looking pissed at Nick for still being a dick to him. Nick just scoffed \"Yeah it's a real tragedy, aint it?\" he answered mockingly whilst putting his hand up and discreetly flipping him off but we all saw it \"Come on\" Carly whispered to me as she grabbed my arm pulling me over to the two boys who looked ready to throw down. \"Yeah it is\" Wade hissed moving a little closer to Nick as the boys stood face to face, Carly shot forward standing in between her brother and her boyfriend as I stood behind them with my arms crossed feeling my resolve coming undone. Breathing heavily I tried not to think about the memories and thought plaguing my mind pulling me back into the darkness I was born into, the screaming and shouting, the hurt and the pure evilness of my past, as the alcohol I drank hammered away at my mental defences. \"Wade, Help Dalton, okay?\" Carly begged but the two boys were still staring each other down \"Please\" she repeated but we both knew what she was really saying was 'he's not worth it, I'll deal with him'. Wade sighed heavily and walked away making Nick smirk like he'd won \"bye Wade\" he called sarcastically giving a little wave as Carly looked at him angrily \"You can be a prick to me, that's fine. But he didn't do anything to you\" Carly said defending her boyfriend to her twin brother. I stood and watched the twins glare at each other before Nick lets out a little laugh \"So you admit that you did something\" Nick said smugly thinking he had caught Carly out of her lie. I rolled my eyes not believe he was still on about this \"I admit, according to you, I did something sure\" Carly answered looking like she was tired of arguing about the same argument and never getting anywhere. \"You dimed me out\" Nick yelled at her as she rolled her eyes \"I did not dime you out!\" Carly scoffed back crossing her arms \"When the sheriffs asked where you got the car, I said I didn't know. I didn't even know it was stolen… you're blaming that on me?\" she shouted looking offended and annoyed. \"You could have covered for me huh?\" Nick huffed raising his voice at his younger twin sister who just sighed sadly she could never win with Nick \"You get caught stealing, it's my fault. You're resisting arrest and it's the cop's fault.\" Carly snapped as Nick laughed \"he took a swing at me\". \"You got kicked off the football team; it's the coach's fault. Mom and Dad kick you out of the house, it's their fault. You can't keep a job for two weeks; it's every manager's fault\" Carly ranted as I bit my lip knowing each of those had happened and knew Nick blamed everyone for his downfall. \"I'm surrounded by idiots\" The older twin claimed easily as I raised my eyebrow at him disliking the fact I had just been called an idiot \"thanks Nicholas\" Nick looked me with a frown \"not you\" I just rolled my eyes again for like the 20th time. \"So why did you come? to piss me off?\" Carly whispered looking up at Nick who face hadn't changed from the glare he had been giving her \"Don't you get it? You're the good twin. I'm the evil one\" Nick announced using that old excuse again, the excuse of being the evil twin so he didn't even have to try. \"Grow up. You are so afraid to take things seriously\". Carly scoffed as she had enough a Nick's crap just like everyone else \"Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving good old Gainesville? 'New York City. Well, I hear they got buildings as tall as the sky'.\" Nick mocked as Carly looked at him wide eyed. \"Okay\" Carly whispered looking hurt, Nick had officially pushed his sister away just like he was doing to everyone else but I knew the truth, somewhere between loosing his scholarship and jail Nick started to believe that he was bad. He was so insecure that Carly had been thriving in life that he assumed the role of the 'evil twin' thinking that his badness was the only way to be, I looked up to see Nick watching Carly walk away with something that looked like remorse on his face. \"Your are such a dick to your sister\" I hissed but seeing the look on his face made my anger fade away \"It's for her own good\" he replied gently kissing my head whilst pulling me down to sit on his lap and passing me a beer.[Chapter 7] Sitting with Nick I smiled as the other's began to wind down and chill out too, the party was getting started and everyone seemed to be getting on again well with the except of Nick who hasn't spoken to anyone in the last 10 minutes. I grinned when I felt Nick's lips on my neck softly \"mmm Nick stop\" I whispered as I reached behind me and put my hand on the back of his head as carried on leaving kisses up and down my neck like at the diner. I sighed in pleasure as he started biting my neck too he knew how to get me, gripping his head tighter I moved my head to the side giving him more access. I felt Nick smirk and put his hand on the side of my neck as my body moved back into his harder the more I felt pleasure tingle through my body. Breathing heavier I turned myself around in his lap and pulled into a rough kiss as we grabbed at each other hungrily, I gasped softly when Nick lifted me up and pulling me closer taking advantage of my gasp he kissed me again his tongue finding mine. Nick and I were stuck in our own little world until the wind picked up bringing this disgusting smell with it, I quickly put my nose into nick chest so I wasn't sick and Nick put his nose in my hair and threw his arm around my back \"That's gross\" I mumbled trying to inhale the smell of Nick's aftershave. \"What's that smell?\" Blake asked out loud as I shut my eyes trying to forget about the bad smell \"That's bad\" I heard Carly muffle she must have her mouth behind her hand \"Oh my god\" Paige cried out as she squealed making me smirk, camping and getting dirty isn't her thing. I felt nick move his head from mine \"Dalton, did you crap your pants again?\" I laughed into his chest and turned myself around to see Dalton look over at us \"No. I don't know. Maybe\" He smelt under his armpits for effect. \"I mean, I'm wearing my work clothes, so…\" Dalton laughed again making Nick and I laugh too. I held the sleeve of my hoodie over my nose and mouth when the wind blew again blowing the smell at us stronger than before making me gag, I felt Nick put his head into the hood on my back \"You ok baby\" I whispered from behind my sleeve and felt Nick nod. I frowned when I saw Wade and Carly step closer to the trees with the flashlight and shining it into the dark \"It's horrible\" Carly groaned again as the smell lingered \"Something's dead out there\" Wade told us as he flashed the light at the tees but I couldn't see anything there. \"No, something's dead right here. We need to drink it back to life. Bless me, Ash.\" Blake exclaimed trying to get the party vibe going again, I smirked grabbing a beer out of the cooler next to Nick and threw to Blake who held it up in cheers. I grabbed two more for Nick and I ready to get my party on \"You sure?\" Nick asked as he opened the beers for us and I just looked at him \"I wish you'd all stop looking at me like I'm some mental case\" I growled getting up and going to sit by Paige and Carly at the fire again. Smiling uneasily at the two of them I just lifted my beer bottle to my lips and drank, Blake looked at us and turned on his stereo which blasted out with music as Dalton ran into the tent to get out his camera. I laughed with the girl as we all drank and sang to the music with no care in the world and forgetting all about the bad smell, I turned when I saw Nick moving closer to the group with his chair and the cooler. Nick gave me a pleading look and I smiled knowing he was sorry but also I knew I had overreacted, I felt Carly push my arm with a small smile on her face \"Go\" I laughed when I knew what she was talking about. Getting up I grabbed my beer bottle and walked over to Nick who held my free hand and pulled me back onto his lap \"I'm sorry baby\" he muttered as he left kisses on my jaw but I shook my head \"I shouldn't have shouted, It's just hard when I feel like my every move is being monitored\". Nick pulled me closer gently \"It's not\" he whispered as I looked into his eyes and kissed him again but this time it wasn't rough or needy it was loving and understanding but I just couldn't utter those 3 words to him. I looked into his eyes as I struggled to tell him just how I felt but to my shock he just smiled genuinely and kissed my hand \"I love you too Ashley\" I grinned as I cuddled myself into him as we drank our beers. Looking at our group of friends I smiled as we all did our own thing but we were still all together and enjoying the moment. Dalton was filming us all, Nick and I were people watching and getting drunk, Carly and Wade were drinking slowly seemingly in a deep conversation, Paige and Blake were cuddling and getting annoyed at Dalton which ended up with Blake spraying his beer at Dalton's camera. \"Come on, man. You don't gotta spray it at me, dude\" Dalton moaned wiping his camera lens but you can't say it wasn't his fault he went back to filming people after he got it dry. I smirked when he turned his camera to Carly and started filming her \"Dalton, what did I say?\" Carly asked him, she really didn't like him filming her she hates seeing herself on camera. I saw Wade look at Dalton annoyed again when he started filming and flirting with Carly he obviously couldn't handle competition not that Dalton was competition for him, Carly was head over heels for the country boy. \"Alright, my bad, my bad. Sorry\" Dalton apologized but it was too late Carly had already gotten to her feet and started chasing him around the camp, I heard nick chuckling behind me and I smiled knowing he didn't really hate Carly. Carly grabbed the camera from Dalton and starting filming him \"Oh and the tables turned\" Carly said jokingly, I smiled knowing Dalton also hated being filmed which is why he films everyone else. I heard Dalton protesting trying to put his hand in front of the lens but tried hiding in our tent. \"Look how cute you are on camera, though. You look good\" Carly told him. I smirked seeing the look on Wade's face, we all knew that Wade knew about Dalton's crush. \"Ohh what should we do with you?\" Carly mocking asked as she continued to film Dalton as he tried to hide, Carly looked at me and I grinned knowing something we could do \"Makeover?\".[Chapter 8] Carly, Paige and I giggled from inside my and Nick's tent as we looked for clothes to dress Dalton up in who was currently being held captive by the 3 of us, Paige held up a blue shirt to Dalton's chest as Carly filmed \"What do you think\" I asked us the two girls who knew fashion better than I did. \"He looked like a smurf\" Paige laughed as we all agreed \"Ooh what about these\" I shout holding up a pair of sparkly sunglasses and pushed them onto his face as the girls burst out laughing from behind me. We finally got him into some clothes on Dalton not that he had a choice but I knew he'd it for Carly if she asked, stepping back I looked at the screen on his camera \"Give us a twirl\" I ordered as Carly captured his entire outfit which was bright yellow hoodie, sunglasses, and his hat off. Paige and Carly walked out of the tent in front of Dalton whilst I stayed behind in case he tried to take the clothes back off \"You're coming out\" I heard Carly say from outside of the tent. \"I don't know\" Dalton replied uncertainly as he held onto the tent flap keeping himself hidden from the boys but I don't blame him I wouldn't either if I had been dressed up like that \"If you don't, I will be so mad,\" Carly said to him teasingly. I knew he wouldn't be leaving the tent anytime soon so I rolled my eyes and gave him a gentle kick out of the tent \"Damn, Ashley\" Dalton complained as I made my way out of the tent smirking \"Sorry D, I didn't mean to kick ya\" Dalton glared at me when he realized I was mocking him. \"He looks like Elton John, but more gay\" Blake called out from next to Nick who was looking annoyed \"Elton John is gay?\" Dalton asked jokingly as he took his camera back from Carly who willingly let It go. I let out a laugh as I walked back over to Nick tripping onto him \"Whoa\" he called as he caught me \"You drunk Ash?\" Wade asked with a laugh when I turned around \"maybe just a smidge\" I replied as I put my finger and thumb together to show him how drunk I was. Wade just shook his head with a smile as I turned back to Nick whose eyes were stared into the back of Wade's head until I put my hand on his cheek and bringing my lips to his passionately. Nick hummed appreciatively and pulled me closer to him as he drops his beer bottle so he could put his arms around me, I raked my hand through his short hair as he rubbed his hands up my sides getting closer to the zip on my hoodie when he stopped suddenly. \"Don't even think about it. I ain't kissing you dude\" Nick joked as we both looked up to see Dalton filming us \"Come on, you know you want to, dude. Now, Ash, I definitely would\" Dalton laughed when Nick tried to hit him as he ran away. I looked at Nick trying not to laugh \"hmm choices\" I squeal when Nick pulled me to him again biting my neck playfully before things started to get serious again I knew the others were just into their boyfriends as I was with Nick. I grinding myself into him when he forced his tongue into my mouth and grab my hips pulling me into him moaning softly, I grabbed the zipper on his hoodie pulling it down and I felt him snaking his hands up my shirt reaching my bra where he put his hands under to squeeze my boobs. I knew we were being filmed by Dalton but at this point, I didn't care, my man hand his hands on me and I felt like I was on fire right now if our friends weren't here Nick and I would defiantly be naked right now doing things you wouldn't talk about in church. I pulled away from him when I saw the camp light up and turned to see where it was coming from \"Whose that?\" I whispered to Nick when I saw the light was coming from the headlights of a truck. Nick just sat in his chair silently as I stood up bringing my beer with me still feeling the alcohol running through me \"Yeah?\" Wade called over to the truck but we receive silence. \"Hey, yo, man, you need something? Blake shouted as he came to stand over with us when Paige pushed him up \"What does he want?\" Carly asked nervously wrapping her arms around herself. \"He wants to cut us up, drink our blood and eat the rest of our corpses for dinner,\" I said mockingly to her getting a laugh off Nick but a glare in return from Carly, she hates horror films whereas I love them. I smiled but turned back to the car and frowning when the headlights were still on, I started to become suspicious and then I felt the anger start to wind up inside of me \"Hey, can you turn off your lights, please?\" Wade asked still going down the polite route as I was pissed off. I turned to Nick who was now frowning along with me, I think he knew something was up just like I thought \"Maybe were on his property?\" Carly said looking at us getting more upset and nervous \"Nah, we didn't pass a gate\" Wade told her trying to calm her down. \"Hey man, turn your lights off\" I looked at Blake who like Nick and I was starting to get annoyed but I could see through his facade, he was getting nervous too, Blake wasn't street smart like Nick and me. \"I'm serious, turn them off or I'm whooping someone's ass,\" Blake said walking forward into Wade's arm giving Wade no choice but to hold him back, my fist started to clench and unclench as I stood looking over to truck I felt Nick's hand grab mine in comfort and support knowing how pissed off I was getting I just hope I wouldn't give him a reason to rethink the whole treating me like a mental case thing again. I guess my anger management and therapy isn't going as well as I thought, I gripped the bottleneck in my hand firmly my breathing coming out shakily having just about enough of this fucker. Before I knew it the bottle had left my hand and soar through the air until I hit the truck's headlight making it go out \"Nick!\" Carly shouted turning around looking furious until she saw Nick sitting down looking at me concerned. \"Ash?\" she whispered as I moved in front of my friends looking at the truck threateningly \"He's not going to hurt us\" I mumbled trance-like as Blake and Dalton began to cheer now someone had made a move. \"Yeah!\" Dalton shouted at the pick up from next to me as I continued to stare at the truck who was now back up from the camp as old memories began hitting me left, right and center \"That was great. That was great, Ash\" Dalton said tapping me on the shoulder like an excited puppy. \"My girl Ash here's hardcore,\" Blake said out loud wrapping his arm around me as if I had gotten his respect for protecting us. I just stood there feeling empty as Carly grabbed my arm when I tried to turn to leave \"what the hell was that about ash!\" I just looked at her and shook my head making her quickly let go of my arm when she realized something was wrong. \"You are awesome ash!\" Dalton called to me still hyped up as I looked at Nick trying to decipher the look on his face but I couldn't bring myself to care right now \"Don't encourage her\" Carly sighed crossing her arms looking at Dalton. Everyone went back to the fire except me I went to Wade's car and sat on the hood looking at the stars and moon realizing how much you could see when you're not in the city. I tensed up when I felt someone sliding on the hood next to me and relaxing when I saw it was just Carly who looked up to the sky with me. \"It's not getting better, is it? She asked talking about my therapy \"I thought it was. I really thought it was but its times like these where I screw up and wonder why I'm even still alive\" I replied softly back to her feeling tears in my eyes. I felt Carly grab my hand as she sighed sadly \"You're here because we love you and would be upset if you weren't, You will get better it just needs time and for you to be honest about your past...\" I cut her off her speech as I angrily wipe away a stray tear. \"my past\" I laughed softly as I looked at the girl who never had any trouble growing up \"When I was 3 I saw my parents drink themselves into alcoholism and had to start looking after myself or else I wouldn't get fed or bathed\" I stopped and took a deep breath when I realized Carly was hanging on my every word. \"At the age of 10 my mom became a prostitute so she could get money for her and my dad to feed their newly found cocaine addiction\" I sniffed and sat up and pulled my legs into myself feeling vulnerable \"I started noticing more men coming around the house at 13 and they were noticing me too\". Carly gasped as she sat up with me \"They started asking for what I was charging and when they were finished with my mom they could have a go with me\" I looked at Carly who was sobbing quietly \"I never did anything with them\". \"When I was 15 I walked in on my mother's dead body on the kitchen floor, my dad looked up when he noticed me walking in, he'd murdered her before killing himself right in front of me\" I began to hiccup as tears finally started to roll down my face. \"That's not all of it but I can't think about it, it hurts too much. Why won't it stop hurting?\" I cried to my best friend who threw her arms around me \"Why didn't you tell me?\" she whispered rubbing my back as I looked into her eyes self consciously. \"I don't like remembering it\" I mumbled as she held my hand tightly \"Does Nick know?\" Carly questioned as she looked over to the camp \"Yeah he knows\" I told her truthfully, Nick and I had no secrets. \"Please don't tell them\" I begged as I felt myself fall apart at the thought of anyone else knowing \"I promise\" Carly promised as we both stopped crying \"I'm so sorry all that happened to you and your dad killing himself and your mom\". I shrugged as I wiped mine and Carly's faces with my hoodie sleeve \"Don't be him doing that was the best thing that ever happened to me\" I replied pushing my past away and gaining my tough exterior back. I jumped off the car hood and walked past the group into the tent and putting one on nicks t-shirts on to sleep in and lay under mine and Nick's blanket softly crying to myself, for myself. I heard someone come into the tent and take off their clothes and lay behind me. Nick. \"Its okay baby, I'm here and I always will be\" I heard his voice say and kissed my head as I cried myself to sleep in his arms.[Chapter 9] \"Damn it. Hey, it's 2:30! Get up!\" \"Let's go, guys. Get up. Get up!\" \"Wade, Dalton, let's go\". \"We're gonna miss the damn game\". \"Nick. Get up!\" I opened my eyes and groaned when I heard something hit the side of our tent, I was too tired for this shit today I just wanted to chill out and sleep, why had I agreed to go to this stupid game. I turned over to see Nick wide awake looking at me with an unreadable expression \"You okay baby?\" he whispered his raspy from sleep as he ran his hand through my hair like I would break at any moment. I didn't like him or anyone else looking at me like that, with concerned eyes it made me feel like I'm weak and pathetic I knew I shouldn't push them away when I start to open up but I can't help it \"I'm fine\". I sat up and stretched shrugging his question off like I didn't know what he was talking about and by the look on his face he knew what I was doing, I got up out of the blanket to get changed before Dalton wakes up and tries to film me naked. \"Ash\" Nick calls to me but quiet enough not to wake Dalton up \"What do you want me to say, Nick? I fucked up?\" I hissed throwing my dirty clothes on the floor angrily \"Well spoiler alert that happens a lot\". Nick sighed and rubbed his face \"I just want you to talk to me instead of keeping it and exploding whenever you get angry\" he whispered leaning on his elbow watching me as I change. I huffed and continued on changing trying to ignore the desperate tone in Nick's voice I knew he hated it when I tried to keep things in but It made me feel like I was 3 years old again trying to keep myself from falling apart. \"Fine\" Nick growled annoyed smacking Dalton on the head, waking him with a jolt and gruffly telling him to wake the fuck up and get changed \"Morning Ash\" Dalton groaned as he rubbed the back of his head \"Morning D\". I unzipped the tent and stepped outside only stopping when I heard Dalton asking Nick what was wrong with me last night but I didn't hear Nick talk I only heard Dalton in pain meaning Nick hit him again. I was so busy eavesdropping on their conversation I didn't notice Carly or Paige calling my name until I turned around and saw them looking at me expectantly \"huh?\" I ask when I realized they asked me a question. \"you okay?\" Carly asked but I knew she was asking about our little chat last night which I was instantly regretting now I had both twins looking at me like I was a porcelain doll. I put on smile knowing it wouldn't fool Carly but Paige wasn't that smart \"yeah I'm good, just really tired\" I told them giving Carly a wry smile as she looked at me knowingly \"I know tell me about it, I hate camping\" Paige said with a little pout making us all laugh. \"So I've gotta pee,\" I tell them seriously as they smile as my straightforwardness \"Yeah me too\" Carly agreed as we started to walk towards the trees \"Wait for me\" Paige shouted from behind us. \"So you and Wade talk some more?\" I asked quietly hoping not to upset her with the question as we walked behind some trees away from the boys, Paige decided she'd pee at the game not wanting to slum it with us. \"We're just in different places right now,\" Carly said softly pulling up her jeans at the same time I did \"He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying\". I nodded wondering what would happen with Nick and I if I ever wanted to move away for a job or something, would he come with me? \"Oh, my God, there's that smell again\" Paige groaned disgustedly as putting her hand in front of her mouth as Carly and I did the same. \"I think it's coming from over there,\" I said point in the direction of the smell with my other hand as Carly looked where I was pointing and grabbed my hand to move in the direction I just pointed to. \"Yeah, let's go follow the smell,\" Paige said to us sarcastically but still following us again not wanting to be left on her own \"What? I wanna see what it is\" Carly said to Paige making her look at Carly weirdly and maybe trying to judge her sanity. \"Why?\" she asked Carly not getting an answer from her but I looked back as Carly carried on pulling me \"Come on Paige we're making memories,\" I say sarcastically as that's what she said to get Carly and I to go on this trip. \"I cannot believe you're making me do this. Only you two\" Paige glared at us from behind her hand as she started to look a little green \"Come on, it'll be fine,\" I told her reassuringly wanting to see myself what the smell was. \"I'm gonna throw up\" Paige moaned dramatically as I looked at Carly rolling my eyes \"Oh, my God. I hate you both\" she told us making us laugh but it was cut short by Carly slipping and pulling me down with her. \"Carly! Ashley!\" I winced as we started falling down a huge hill, Carly's hand slipped from mine as we tumbled hitting everything in our path, screaming in pain I quickly put my arm out and grabbed onto a small tree stump sticking out of the ground. \"Shit\" I groaned as I felt pain everywhere bringing my hand up I realized I had cut my head and my arms from trying to stop myself from falling \"Ashley!\" I heard Carly scream my name and gasped seeing her upside down in a pile of.. something. \"Are you okay?\" Paige shouted down to us no signs of actually helping us \"I'm stuck!\" Carly called back up sounding scared \"Ashley?\" Paige shouted but I just ignored her as I got to my feet and slid carefully to the bottom of the hill. \"I'm here\" I groaned as pain racked through my body as I leaned forward to grab Carly's waist \"Ashley is that you?\" Carly gasped when I touched her \"yeah it's me,\" I told her as I tried to pull her out. I heard the boys calling us from the camp \"Nick! Wade!\" I shouted hoping they could hear me from where we were, I could hear Paige shouting the boys and voices shouting our names from the trees too as they got closer. \"I got you Carly but were both slipping,\" I told her, I couldn't hold onto her much longer as we were both slipping closer to the dead carcasses \"Don't let me go please Ash, please\" Carly begged as I used as much strength as I could to hold her. \"Wade! Please help me get out of here\" Carly screamed frightened whilst trying to keep her arms out of the blood as much as I could \"Paige do something\" I shouted to the blonde girl back up the hill bank \"We're down here! Guys, help us!\".[Chapter 10] \"Ashley\" I heard Nick shout as they found us, I turned my head when I felt a hand on my shoulder and sighed happily when I saw Wade behind me \"I got her,\" he told me as he took Carly's weight off me. I looked up to see Nick looking down at me concerned and started to walk down the hill to get me \"I'm ok\" I tell him as he pulls me to him and back up the hill to where the others were stood. \"Your bleeding babe,\" Nick told me as he looked my head and arms \"Yeah I'm not great at falling down steep hills\" I joked as I felt my head \"Ouch\" I groaned when it stung. \"There's a road kill pit down here,\" Dalton said stating the obvious to us \"No shit\" I muttered as I put my arms around Nick feeling safe again. \"Yeah, that smells about right\" Nick groaned sounding like he was going to be sick before looking down at me \"are you sure you're okay?\" he asked me pulling me away from his chest so he could look at me again. I nodded my head slowly \"Yeah I'm good, just hurt my head and my everything else\" I laughed as I looked at the scratches on my arms \"You'll be bruised for the next week\" Dalton joked as he looked at them too. I could hear Blake asking Paige if she was okay making me roll my eyes, she didn't do anything to help \"You okay Carls?\" I asked my best friend softly when I saw Wade pulling her back up the hill. \"Yeah thanks for the help back there,\" she said to me looking at me with a gratefully making me nod \"no worries\" I looked at her clothes seeing they were covered in blood and whatever else was in that pit. I could hear humming sound which came from the pickup truck that just pulled up on the other side of the pit, it kinda looked like the truck from last night but there was no way he could have fixed his head light that quick. \"Hey, is that the truck from last night?\" Blake asked pointing in the direction of the dirty looking pickup truck \"Not unless he fixed his headlight\" I said to everybody voicing my previous thought. We all watched silently as a redneck looking guy get out of the truck and grabbed a dead deer from the back of the truck \"Hey!\" Blake shouted at the redneck guy to get his attention. \"Don't you see that?\" Carly said pointing to a human looking hand which I had only just realized was there \"What is that?\". The redneck man walked over all the road kill and grabbed the hand pulling it as we all watched wide-eyed, maybe some serial killers like the Hewitt family from the Texas chainsaw massacre live out here, god I hope not that would be a shit start to the day. \"No way\" Wade whispered in disbelief that this man was pulling a hand from dead animals \"What are you doing, man?\" he called to the redneck as he stood in the middle of the pit. The guy had pulled the hand from the pile of road kill making us all sigh in annoyance when we realized that he was joking and the hand wasn't even real.\"Anyone need a hand?\" The redneck guy said waving the hand around laughing. \"I'm just fooling. It's not real, see\" he said hitting the back of the hand making a tapping noise \"God\" Carly whispered in annoyance we had only just woken up and she was covered in blood nearly having a heart attack. \"I found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago,\" the guy said as if we were still talking to him, Carly walked over to Paige and tried brushing herself down, I saw Paige give Carly some water to wash her hands with. \"What are you guys doing here?\" the redneck asked us giving us a wide smile showing us his dirty teeth as my inner distrust started to flare up \"We were all camping up through those trees,\" Wade told the guy making me glare at him. \"Really? Telling the weird guy things about us?\" I muttered as Nick pulled himself closer to me \"Hey, is there a gas station around here?\" Wade asked the guy again after pretending like he didn't hear me. \"Well, I got some gas in the truck if...\" the man was cut off with his offer by Wade who shook his head \"I need a fan belt\" we all looked at Wade shocked except Paige who probably thought a fan belt was a fashion accessory. \"What?\" Carly questions him looking pissed when Wade shrugged at her \"Just busted\" he said to her looking apologetic \"Of course. Perfect\" she said sarcastically to Wade and continued cleaning her hand of the blood. \"Bo might have one. Runs a station in Ambrose\" the guy told us pointing in a direction in which I'm assuming Ambrose is, this Ambrose place must not sell toothpaste I grimaced when I saw his teeth again. \"Where's that?\" wade asked him politely as if he'd known him for more than 5 minutes and he wasn't just throwing dead carcasses onto a stinking pit \"Fifteen miles up the road\" The redneck answered scratching the back of his neck. \"Let's just get one in Baton Rouge. We'll put it on when we get back\" Blake trying to convince Wade to leave the car obviously wanting to get to the game \"Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car, what if that guy from last night strips it?\" Wade protested as Blake sighed heavily. He did have a good point that guy could be pissed at what happened last night and steal wades car in retaliation of me breaking his headlight \"You're gonna miss the game, then\" Blake said showing what he really cared about. \"Yeah, well, that's not why I came\" Wade admitted looking at Carly making her smile back lovingly \"All right, look. I'll run you up to the station. Kickoff's in a couple hours\" Blake told Wade shocking me that he was actually trying to help him. \"You're already late you still got find a scalper and you gotta snag tickets. Y'all should just go now. I'll stay with my car\" Wade said getting a surprised look from Blake \"It's fine. Get me a fan belt on the way back. Make sure it's a 15 –inch\" Wade continued as he put his hands in his pockets. \"Gotcha,\" Blake said to Wade as they do one of those man handshakes \"I'll give you a ride,\" a voice said making me look at the redneck guy whom I think we all forgot was there \"You serious?\" Wade asked in disbelief as I looked at him like he was crazy for even thinking about getting into a car with this guy. \"If you like\" the guy replied back shrugging his shoulders which were probably as dirty as his teeth \"Well, yeah. Yeah\" Wade agreed giving the man a smile as Blake tapped him on the shoulder \"That's cool? Blake questioned looking a little impatient. \"Yeah, if it's cool,\" Wade said pointing to the guy who just nodded his head. \"I'm going with you,\" Carly told wade making everyone look at her shocked and honestly I didn't want her to go with this creepy looking guy. \"Carly, no\" Paige said to her seemingly feeling the same way I did about Carly being with this stranger \"Yes. It'll be fine\" Carly stubbornly told Paige smiling then seeing my face she rubbed my arm comfortingly. \"All right, let's go. Come on, Paige\" Blake muttered starting to pull Paige back up the hill \"Nick look at her you can let her leave looking like that\" I whispered to my boyfriend who looked at me and then back to his little sister. \"Carly\" he shouted to her making her turn round with a frown on her face, probably thinking he was going to make a smart ass comment \"What?\" she asked with a sigh but smiled when he took off his tank top and gave it to her to wear. \"I'll leave tickets at will call\" Blake shouted down to us as Carly looked at Nick appreciatively \"Thank you,\" she said looking at him and taking the vest from him \"All right. All good, man\" Wade said to Blake who nodded and helped Paige back through the trees. Carly stood by me and nick and pulled off her dirty shirt and giving it to Dalton to hold while she put nicks tank top on, I looked at the redneck guy and saw he was checking out Carly with a dirty smirk on his face. I stood in front of her protectively and gave the guy a menacing look but he just smiled and laughed when the guys mimicked what I was doing, he looked at me and winked which nearly made me throw up in my mouth. \"Oh, it's okay\" I heard Carly say behind me, I turned to look at her and laughed when I saw Dalton was holding up her dirty shirt to block the guys view \"Nice Dalton\" I laughed before looking at Carly and said seriously \"if he touches you I will kill him\" to which she smiles and pulled me in for a hug whispering thanks in my ear. \"Come on, baby let's get out of here,\" Wade said grabbing Carly's hand and pulling her towards the truck as I watched after them feeling helpless wanting them to stay with us but having no choice but to watch them go. \"Man, you're just gonna let them leave like that? With a guy who throws road kill in a pit for a living?\" Dalton questioned us seriously as Nick and I looked at him with smiles on our faces. If anyone could make me and nick smile when we're feeling unhappy about something its Dalton that's why all three of us were so close, well that and the 3 of us live in the same apartment. \"You clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic-Tank-Man.\" Nick said grabbing my hand and pulling me up the hill as I turned my head to look at Dalton \"What's the difference?\" I said mockingly when he looked at me confused. \"Well, I don't walk through it, that's one.\" Dalton said looking proud of himself but faltered a little \"That's a difference, right?\" Nick and I just laughed harder and walked off leaving a confused Dalton running after us.[Chapter 11] I found myself sat in a car between Dalton and Nick again but this time we were in Blake's car which was so much roomier and no injured legs from the number of times Dalton had kicked me in Wade's car. The heat from outside was radiating through the car making me a little irritated, that and the face we were stuck in traffic that looked never-ending I considered getting out of the car and walking. \"Dude, it's over,\" Nick told Blake from his seat next to me as he leaned his head out of the window \"It'll move\" Blake replied with hope in his voice but we'll need a little more than Blake's hope to get us to the game in time. \"It's not moving\" Paige moaned after a few minutes of us still not moving \"We'll make the second half\" Blake sighed trying to convince us to wait for a game that none of us cared about except Blake. \"I'm not sitting in this,\" I told him sitting forward in my chair glaring at the front window \"What do you want me to do?\" Blake sighed frustrated as we all started to shout at each other. \"I'm not missing this game,\" Blake told us with finality but we continued to shout at him \"Turn the car around, okay?\" Nick argued over us as Blake dropped his head onto the steering wheel setting off the horn. After 10 minutes of pure stubbornness, Blake finally turned the car around and headed back to the camp \"Thank god\" I muttered leaning into Nick who nodded at me. \"Hey Paige you'd better call Carly and tell her that we're coming back\" I instructed the blonde who looked back at me with a raised eyebrow \"Why can't you do it\" she questioned as I made myself comfy. \"Because I don't want to and I told you to do it\" I sarcastically smiled widely knowing she knew I wasn't really being mean \"Okay, bitch\" she said rolling her eyes whilst pulling out her cell phone to call Carly. \"Thanks, jerk\" I replied with a shit-eating grin feeling Nick starting to rub little circles on my waist as Paige talked to Carly where they agreed on us camping out again. Paige put away her cell and turned to Blake \"they haven't got the fan belt thing but they said to just head up the road that we got off at for the campsite but it's washed out at the end so they'll meet us there\". \"Wait so they don't even have the stupid fan belt yet?\" I asked her frustrated blowing my hair out my face \"No, but hopefully they'll have it by the time we get there don't worry\" Paige said back to me a little frustrated herself but looked at me for a minute before saying \"just calm down\". I presume that it was supposed to comfort me in some way seeing as she didn't say it in a patronizing tone I guess she had noticed all the times Carly had tried to calm me down when I get angry. I just hummed and put my head back against Nick's shoulder, my legs on Dalton's lap and closed my eyes hoping that if I fall asleep we'll be there when I wake up. \"You're seriously going to sleep on us?\" I heard Dalton's ask but my eyes felt too heavy to reopen so I just opted for a gentle kick \"Shut up Dalton\". Wade and I finally made it to the garage in Ambrose which I didn't think actually existed when that creepy guy started to get, well, creepy on us. So now I kinda feel guilty for being suspicious of him when he was just trying to help us, I guess hearing Ashley's warnings put me in a weird mind frame, she was usually freaky accurate about that kind of thing. \"Hello?\" Wade shouted through the garage shutter door as I looked through the front door window but it was empty inside \"Hello?\" I called opening the door. I glanced at Wade who was still looking through the windows on the shutter door \"You see anybody?\" I questioned but he shook his head \"No, nobody\" I felt my phone vibrate and ring in my pocket and pulled it out to see Paige's name on the caller i.d. \"Hello?\" I answered walking away from the door \"Hey, it's me. We're heading back\" Paige's voice greeted me as I frowned \"Really? Why? What happened?\". Paige sighed and I could hear beeping in the background \"Traffic. Did you get that fan belt thing or whatever?\" Paige questioned reminding me to look around for someone \"No. There's no one at the gas station. I don't know where we're going right now\". \"So where do you want us to pick you up?\" I stood and put my hands on my hips looking back towards the washed out road \"Just head up the road that we got off at for the campsite, it's washed out at the end. Call us when you get there\" I dictated running a hand through my hair. \"We'll camp in the same place as yesterday, but away from that pet cemetery\" Paige laughed as I grimaced remembering the feeling of entrails squelching between my fingers \"Cool. See you then\". \"Hey, there's that house of wax,\" Wade said pointing out the creepy looking building as he walked up behind me \"Wade, what about the fan belt,\" I asked him trying to divert his attention. Wade stopped in front of me and shrugged \"well there's no one at the station\" I looked around again spotting a church to my left \"Why don't we ask someone in the church?\". \"All right. All Right\" Wade gave in as we walked to the church that also seemed old looking like the wax house, pushing open the doors we both stopped at we saw in front of us. There was a service going on and we had just walked right in the middle of it, the man kneeling next to the coffin turned to look at us as did the priest who gave us a look of scrutiny for interrupting. \"Oh! Um, we should go\" I whispered to Wade who just replied with a quiet yeah as we backed out of the church quietly feeling equally as bad for what we had just walked in on. \"What should we do, just wait out here?\" I asked him feeling a little uncomfortable about our current situation \"I don't know. I feel kind of messed up waiting outside a church waiting for a funeral to end.\" Wade commented kicking a few of the stones with a shrug. I heard the church doors open behind me and turned to see that guy who was kneeling come out of it with a kind of sad look on his face pulling out a pack of cigarettes \"Hey, sorry about walking in. we didn't know…\" \"You shouldn't have walked in,\" the guy said cutting wade off mid-sentence and started to smoke looking pissed \"Yeah, I know. It's just that we have car trouble. We're not from this town\" Wade told the guy trying to apologize. Seeing Wade getting nowhere with this guy I pitched in \"we're actually looking for a guy named Bo, he works at the gas station\" I asked gently trying to antagonize the obviously grieving man. \"You found him\" Bo informed us shortly as Wade gave me a look of happiness and surprise before turning back to Bo who did not share the same joy as my boyfriend. \"Really? Well um, we need a fan belt\" Wade told him awkwardly clearing his throat and pointing back in the direction of the camp \"We were camping up the road…\". Bo laughed in disbelief through the middle of Wade's talking causing me to wince knowing if he wasn't pissed off at us before he probably was by now. \"A fan belt? You walk in on a funeral for a fucking fan belt?\" Bo spluttered looking like he couldn't believe the audacity of us interrupting his loved one's funeral. Wade and I just stood planted to the ground looking anywhere but Bo's face \"Well, let me just go dump the casket in the ground. I'll be right there\" he hissed as he threw his cigarette on the ground. \"Look we're sorry\" I tried to apologize as Bo started to walk past me but he just looked at me indifferently \"yeah\" he muttered in a disbelieving voice and carried on into the church. \"That's twice today. I'm an asshole\" Wade groaned following me down the path as I passed him \"Let's just go back to the road\" he sighed sounding put out. \"Hey\" I heard a voice call out to us from behind, we turned to see Bo walking to us \"Hey, I'm sorry. You know, someone very special to me just passed. And I didn't mean to take it out on you\" he apologized looking mournful. \"No, no, no. it's totally understandable.\" I replied to him with a sympathetic smile as he nodded with a grateful expression, it must be horrible to lose someone so close to you, is this ever how Ashley felt loosing all of her family in one swoop?. \"I reckon things will wrap up soon. Why don't I meet you guys back at the station in about a half?\" Bo asked looking down at me as I nodded quickly \"That would be great if that's okay?\" I accepted politely him not wanting to put him out after the walking in on the funeral thing. Bo looked at me softly as he nodded \"yeah\" he agreed quietly before walking off back to the church looking less pissed off than the last time, I turned to Wade with a triumphant smile \"Great\".[Chapter 12] I started to walk away from the church but soon stopped when I realized wade wasn't following me\"What?\" I asked confused as he turned to me slowly with a little bit of an annoyed look on his face \"nothing. Looks like your fan clubs got a little bigger.\". He stomped off in front of me as I looked at the church shocked \"are you serious?\" I said in disbelief as Wade scoffs \"Yeah. I am serious. It's obvious Dalton still has a crush on you too but then again he likes Ashley too so I'm guessing he likes anything that walks.\" Wade huffed knowing Dalton likes pretty much any girl that talks to him. \"Oh my god. Okay, that's three times today. You're officially an asshole.\" I hissed at him making him stop in his tracks giving me a look \"let's go see your famous house of wax\" I offered sarcastically waving my hands in the direction of the building. \"But I'm still your favorite asshole right?\" Wade joked in a playful voice behind me \"Always\" I replied smiling flirtatiously nudging him in the shoulder as he gently kicked me in the butt. We continue to push and make fun of each other until we made it to the house of wax \"I don't know what you expect to see in here\" I questioned Wade quietly starting to regret my choice in coming up here. Looking over my shoulder I saw Wade searching through his pockets before pulling something out \"It is wax. Like, literally.\" He said to me excitedly showing me the wax on the tip of his pocketknife. I scratched the wall and felt some of the wax curls under my fingernails feeling amazed that someone had taken the time and skill to build a whole building out of wax \"You're not going to go in there are you?\" I blurted as Wade pushed the door open even though there was a clear closed sign next to it. \"Yeah\" He whispered excitably like a kid at Christmas, walking into the museum I sighed in relief when I saw it was empty \"Doesn't closed mean 'I don't want you in here'?\" I questioned Wade as played around with some of the wax stuff. \"Relax. I just wanna take a quick look\" He said as I looked around cautiously to see if there was anyone in any of the other rooms \"hello? Anybody in here?\" Wade called out making me jump. He turned back to me and shrug his shoulder carelessly \"See relax Car we're fine\" I rolled my eyes in annoyance I didn't really feel like relaxing in a wax museum, somewhere that was specifically stated as closed. \"How cool is this? Everything in her is wax. The floor, the walls. Look at this\" Wade called to me happily pointing at a table thing \"this is wax\" he declared again excitedly showing his gorgeous dimples \"Hm yeah. Cool. Awesome\" I answered offhandedly I really didn't want to be here. \"Who are these people supposed to be?\" Wade asked me as I looked at the wax people confused \"I don't know\" I shrugged uncaringly \"aren't there supposed to be famous people in a wax museum, I don't recognize this guy\" Wade protested pointing to a wax version of a man looking like he's having fun, so creepy, I'm starting to regret not letting Ashley come. I looked around at all the wax people and then some newspaper pages caught my eye \"Trudy opens house of wax. Trudy's wax carvings are a hit at the state fair. Trudy and husband are expecting first child\". I looked at Wade confused \"since when is a wax sculptor a celebrity?\" He walked over to me and looked at the same clippings \"I don't know. small town I guess.\" I nodded knowing how ironic it was that he came to that assumption \"That's right. You like small towns\" I acknowledged a little bit sarcastically. He smiled knowingly and gave a little sigh \"I didn't say I wasn't gonna like New York I just said that I haven't made a decision yet. I still have time, all right?\" I just smiled at him putting on my sweet voice hoping to sway him \"Well, I'd really like you to be there with me.\" \"Oh no, there's a fire. Help me, Carly. I'm melting. My skirts gonna catch fire. My legs are burned\" I heard Wade say in a high pitched voice behind me, I turned around to see him with a lighter next to the wax ballerinas skirt. I ran over and knocked his hand out of the way before he could melt it \"cut it out please\" I checked on the wax ballerina to make sure that he hadn't burned it too bad \"You're my hero\" he said again in the high pitched voice. \"That's not cool wade!\" I argued knowing he was doing it to get off the moving talk. \"Hey Car, there's a dog for you\" Wade sauntered over to the wax dog confidently \"Hey, puppy. You a little wax dog too? What's up dog?\" as he bends down to touch the wax dog it jumped up and barked at him. \"Jesus!\" Wade shouted and fell over looking terrified, I let out a laugh and clapped my hands as the dog ran off \"yeah haha, laugh it up\" Wade said rolling his eyes and standing up looking embarrassed \"what's a dog doing in here anyway\" His poor man pride got hurt. I looked at all the little wax things on the counter, they were all like hybrids of stuff like a woman's head and chest on a lizards body, weird, turning the sculptures over I noticed they all had the same name carved into them 'Vincent'. I turned to see Wade playing on the piano \"this Vincent guy is quite the artist\" I said to him scoffing at the weird art \"Yeah, I think this Vincent guy needs therapy\" Wade replied mockingly noticing all the eccentric art too, I agreed with him. This Vincent guy must have some problems going on in his life if he spends his time making things out of wax especially things so weirdly crude, I nodded at Wade as he stood up from the piano and whispered carefully \"Yeah he's obviously, got something wrong with him\".[Chapter 13] Watching Wade leave the piano room I looked over to see him in a room which looks like a dining area, there was a very long table with a realistic feast on it \"I mean, look how detailed this is. Tell me this doesn't look real\" Wade exclaimed holding up a wax carrot. Looking out the window I frowned just wanting to leave but Wade seemed really content with staying \"I don't really care, I mean. Not that its bad but everything made out of wax? Don't you think that's a little weird\" I questioned feeling really uncomfortable in here. Walking into the dining area I frowned seeing the flame from his lighter go out, he was obviously melting things again \"those aren't wax\" he said looking in the corner of the room. Looking over to where he was pointing I saw two old dusty high chairs behind the door but I couldn't only see one name, Vincent, frowning I wondered what the artists baby chair be doing in this wax house if they weren't made of wax. \"Oh whatever\" I huffed giving up and walking back out the room looking over my shoulder \"hey, when do you think the last person was here?\" I questioned walking over to a mirror on the wall \"A while probably\" Wade replied as I pulled my hair together. Rubbing all the cobwebs off of the mirror I leaned in so I could see my reflection, the only thing I didn't count on seeing, however, was somebody else's, this person looked freaky like half of their face was disfigured. I gasped and turned quickly to look out of the window but it was now empty \"What? What is it?\" Wade questioned as he rushed into the room and looking around \"I just saw someone\" I told him pointing to the window shaking. \"It was probably just a wax thing,\" Wade told me rolling his eyes making me frown angrily \"No, no. I wasn't a wax thing. It was moving and it was freaky looking\" I admitted wondering why that guy looked so weird. I turned back to the window hoping he wouldn't come back and that others were here now ready to pick us up \"I'll go check it out\" Wade announced as he starting to walk to the front door making my eyes widen. \"Wade, where are you going? Don't leave me here\" I begged him not wanting to be left alone in this place, more now than before \"Wade, come on\" I tried leaving with him but he gently pushed me back inside telling me to say put while he went to check it out. I shut the door behind me and looked at all the sculptors warily like they would come alive at any time and eat me or something worse, walking through the piano room I noticed Wade in the bushes through the window but that did nothing to comfort me. I carried on walking until I came to the dining room where I looked around warily as my heart raced, I put my hands on top of one of the chairs to steady myself until I heard a banging noise come from outside and saw it was Wade trying to open the basement hatch. Wade looked up and shrugged his shoulder with a smile as if to say see it's nothing but I still wasn't convinced, I know I saw something, hearing a noise I turned my head and frowned following the noise knowing if Paige was here right now she'd be shouting at me. Opening a partially closed door I came to a room that looked like a kitchen, where a waxed figure of a maid was placed. Looking around the room I stopped every time something creaked or made a noise, I was not ready to be attacked by some freaky looking man. Walking backward I stayed alert to every creak or noise that I could hear wondering where the hell Wade had gotten to, suddenly I heard a bang come from the window and I whirled around to see a wax figure with a disfigured face directly behind me. Screaming I pushed myself away from the figure making it tumble to the ground and breaking into pieces, feeling my heart beating faster than it was before I sprinted out of the kitchen stopping for nothing. Throwing open the wax doors I ran outside where Wade was waiting looking worried as I freaked out \"whoa Car, what's wrong?\" He questioned holding my arms in his hands looking at my face. \"This place is freaking me out!\" I told him trying to get away from the building but Wade held onto me tightly with a small smile \"calm down. There's no one here\" he told me trying to soothe me but I was already done. I knew it was him who banged on the window but I know what I saw and I didn't want to be here if he decided to come back at any time \"Please, I just wanna go\" I begged pulling my arms out of Wade's grasp as he looks at me guiltily. \"Okay. Okay, we'll go to the gas station then.\" Wade offered as I grabbed his hand and started to pull him away from the museum, he gave another sparing look at the house silently and knew if I wanted to go then I was really scared or upset. Wade gripped my hand tighter and I knew he felt guilty for scaring me \"It's okay Car, the others will be here soon, we can get the fan belt and leave. Then you'll never have to see another wax museum ever again\" he joked as I power walked us back down to the town. I gave him a small smile showing that I was acknowledging his words but honestly my mind was on that scary looking guy, how were we not certain this is the guy whose headlight Ashley broke last night and was now stalking us, waiting for us to let our guard down and attack? Is that why he was watching me from the window but the thought that really terrified me was, how long had he been watching us?...[Chapter 14] Getting back I noticed it was starting to get dark again, the guys set the tents back up but away from where we camped last night. Paige and I sat on the grass looking at her music collection as the guys relieved themselves on some trees. Watching Blake walk up to Nick and Dalton I wondered what they were saying when they looked over their shoulders to us \"So have you decided to tell him about it or not?\" I questioned my blonde friend as she looked up to me oblivious before realizing what I was talking about. She quickly looked over to Blake before turning back and sighing heavily \"I'm not sure, I mean Carly keeps pressuring me but I don't even know if I am pregnant yet\" I nod as she blurts out her thoughts \"I think I need to know for sure\". \"Well you need to find out soon, he'll be pissed if you are and didn't tell him\" I told her as I stood up brushing the dirt off of my hands \"I'm scared\" Paige whispered looking up at me sadly \"I'm not ready for this\" she admitted wiping away her tears as the boys walked over to us. \"Hey Paige\" Blake called making Paige jump as she turned to him with a smile \"Yeah?\" there was no trace of her tears anymore \"Nick, Ash, and Dalton are gonna go pick up Carly and Wade,\" Blake told us as I turned to Nick confused \"We are?\". Nick nodded and pulled me into his arms as Paige looked at Blake with a raised eyebrow \" Why? We can go\" she told him standing up brushing her hands across her tracksuit \" Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving\" Blake pouted like a child. I snorted out loud as Nick looked in my direction \"I'm sure sleep is the last thing on his mind\" I mumbled to my boyfriend who smirked at me \"I know the feeling\" I semi-glared at Nick as I walked over to hug Paige \"No matter what you decide I'm here for you\". I let go of Paige who nods at me gratefully \"I'll see you later\" I told her as Blake put the radio in their tent obviously getting ready for their night ahead \"Have fun\" I joked to her as I walked over to Blake's truck where the 3 guys stood waiting. Nick held his hand out waiting for Blake to hand over the keys \"Why don't you let my man drive\" Blake laughed dropping his keys into Dalton's hands who looked as shocked as I felt but then again no-one but Nick, Dalton and I knew the truth. \"Really? Dalton asked Blake who nodded and walked off back to Paige \"Idiot\" I muttered knowing Blake didn't care who drove as long as he got his night with Paige, watching Dalton get cocky I knew Nick would soon put him back in his place. \"You heard him. Move.\" Dalton said as Nick and I gave each other a look \"Do it\" I said to my boyfriend who quickly reached out and grabbed one of Dalton's nipples and squeezed making D cry out in shock. \"Give me the damn keys\" Nick growled out as I laughed Dalton probably regretted being cocky now, Nick held out his hand as Dalton started to breathe heavily from the pain \"Okay. Very slow. Thank you\" he gave the keys to Nick who instantly let go of his nipple. Nick winked at me and climbed into the driver's seats as Dalton gasped holding his chest looking up at me like I was a traitor \"Why would you tell him to do that\" I grinned and patted his back \"You know why D\" I answered as he nodded in agreement \"Yeah I know\". Getting into the backseat I let Dalton sit up front so he could lick his wounds \"So where are we going?\" I asked Nick whilst he was fiddling with the GPS \"some town not far from here called Ambrose\" I nodded looking out of the window seeing nothing but trees and darkness I can't wait to go home. \"I don't think this is cool, just coming in like this\" Carly says nervously as she looks out of the door of Bo's garage, they had made it from the House of Wax without any creepy guys popping up but Bo was still nowhere in sight and Wade didn't want to wait anymore. \"What? Look, the door was unlocked\" Wade waved in the direction of the open door as he looked through the fanbelts hanging from the wall \" He said he'd be half an hour, he's been 45 minutes. I'm sure he won't mind\" Wade muttered not really caring about it. \"You know, if your brother and his yes man hadn't come along we would've fit with Blake. None of this would've happened\" Wade grumbled to his girlfriend, he and Nick had never got on so obviously Dalton jumped on that bandwagon but luckily Ashley didn't mind him. Carly sighed having heard this rant one too many times \"Once again, that's not my fault\" she crossed her arms tiredly she hated having her bother and boyfriend fighting all the time, she wished that he and Nick could have a cool relationship like she and Ashley have. \"I don't understand his beef with me. I've tried to be cool with him, his own girlfriend is cool with me and she's got bigger issues than he has\" Wade groaned exasperated desperate to understand why Nick still treats him like shit. \"Nick's got beef with everybody. You just can't take it personally\" Carly told him encouragingly although it hurt her to think that the love of her life and her twin brother couldn't get on even for her sake. Ashley told her that its because Nick's just being the older protective brother but Carly believe he's just turned into a massive asshole, something he wasn't when they were kids \"Yeah, I guess\" Wade shrugged defeated as he continued looking through the fan belts. Nick and I always used to stick together, then when we were in junior high Nick would get into trouble here and there and our parents would always, like compare us. I was the good twin and Nick was the evil twin, as he likes to say\" Carly began as she sighed remembering the hurt look on Nick's face the first time their parents asked him why he couldn't be good like she was. \"He kind of got this image. He totally played it up as if that's what he had to be or something\" Carly huffed she was always upset at the fact that people always compared the two, she and Nick were definitely two different people and if wanted to ruin his life than so be it. Carly looked outside and saw that the sky was already turning a dark blue, night time was coming \"It's already getting dark. I hate the winter.\" she muttered to herself as she rubbed her arms feeling the afternoon chill drifting across her skin. \"He's got everything but a 15-inch. I'll just have to use a 16-inch. I'll just have to make it work somehow\" Wade grabbed the 15 inch pissed off until a voice at the door made both he and Carly freeze \"You plan on stealing that?\"[Chapter 15] Wade and Carly spun around at the voice and gasped seeing Bo leaning against the door like he had been watching them for a while \"No. We didn't know how much longer you were gonna be and, you know, we didn't wanna interrupt again\" Wade told him awkwardly as Bo just stared at him. \"I left you money on the counter, but you don't have the right size. You don't have any 15 inches\" Wade said holding up the fan belt and motioned to the money he left so Bo wouldn't actually think they were stealing from him. Bo looked at Wade with a smirk \"I do at the house\" Wade looked at Bo warily as his eyes bored into him, it was like he disliked him, Wade just nodded knowingly as Carly looked between the two men as they stared at each other. \"I hope you're not getting the wrong idea that we're in here\" Carly said to Bo sweetly as she tried to straighten out the misunderstanding between them, Bo took his eyes off Wade and looked at her with a smile \"No, it's okay\" he affirmed taking the money Wade left off of the counter. \"Does that cover it?\" Wade muttered hoping they could just get the fan belt and leave, he hated the way this Bo guy made him feel and worse he hated the way Bo looked at Carly, his girlfriend. Bo glanced back over to Wade and shrugged with a smirk \"It's close enough\" he then turned his eyes to Carly the flirtatious smile appearing again \"Why don't we get the one you need? It's only a couple of blocks\". Carly nodded with a kind smile her mother always taught her to be polite even to strangers, she still felt bad about being a little rude to the guy who gave them a ride, plus Bo had just buried someone he probably needs the company right now. \"Yeah, all right\" Carly agreed happily as she and Bo stepped forward to leave but Wade didn't budge as he looked a little confused \"You keep fan belts at your house?\" he questioned Bo suspiciously wondering why he just didn't keep all the fan belts here. Carly gave Wade a small glare at his suspicion as Bo turned with a small smile \"I get things delivered there when I'm not here. If you wanna hold on to the 16 that's fine by me.\" he smirked at Wade like he knew the younger boy wouldn't take it. \"No, no, no. It's okay.\" Carly jumped in wanting to go home or at least get back to her friends and brother, the three of them walked outside ready to go up to the house when Wade spoke up \"Hey, you mind if I use your restroom real fast?\". Bo kind of stuttered as if he wasn't expecting that \"Oh, up at the house. That one's out of order.\" Wade looked at Bo feeling even more suspicious but had to carry on for Carly's sake she'll just think he's being jealous or rude \"All right\". They all carried on walking in silence following Bo up to his house, Wade suddenly remembered the poster he had seen in the town and tried to break the silence \"So is it too late to sign Carly up for that beauty pageant?\" Carly looked at Wade and laughed knowing his sense of humor. \"Now, unfortunately, it is, because you would've won hands down,\" Bo told her charmingly making her blush at his words \"Thank you\" she mumbled flattered as Wade watched them with jealousy, why did he pick such a stupid topic to talk about. Wade wasn't usually the jealous type but there was just something about the way Bo looked at Carly but he put the bad feelings aside knowing they would be out of here soon and will never see Bo again so he tried to change the subject again, this time to something he knew Bo wouldn't be able to turn around into a compliment for his girlfriend. \"That house of wax is pretty cool\" Bo looked at Wade in surprise \"You went inside?\" He questioned them sharply as Carly and Wade were taken back by his tone \" Yeah. Yeah, it was unlocked, so, you know...\" Wade muttered trailing off realizing his mistake. \"Everything seems to be unlocked around you, now don't it?\" Bo sneered at Wade a little before putting a kinder tone on for Carly \"Yeah, people used to come to see it from miles away and Trudy was the main...I guess \"artist\" is the appropriate word,\" he told her with a little bit of sadness in his voice. Carly heard the tone instantly and wondered why he was so sad about it \"What about Vincent?\" she asked tentatively not wanting to upset him as he looked shocked at what she had said so she explained to him \"I saw his name on a lot of the work\". Bo gave her a small smile and continued \"He was one of Trudy's boys\" Bo's answer was short but it had Carly wanting to know more, she was intrigued by the story \"They still around?\" she questioned as Wade gave her a look as to ask her to stop asking questions but she didn't acknowledge him as she gazed up at Bo. \"No, no. It's a horrible story. Trudy's husband, Doc Sinclair, he was a doctor in the big city until he got his license revoked for doing surgeries on the side. Stuff that, you know, most doctors wouldn't dare do\" Bo began to explain as Carly looked at him enthralled. \"So he moved him and Trudy out here to Ambrose, made a fresh start with his medical practice and, you know, Trudy really found her calling with that whole wax-sculpture thing,\" He told them as they passed the house of wax \"It was her dream to do something really incredible here. And then she had a couple kids, picket fence.\" Wade looked at Bo confused \"What's horrible about that?\" he would love to get Carly into his hometown and have kids of their own. The whole white picket fence deal, he would be content with the apple pie life. \"Trudy got a cyst in her brain. She just started rotting away. Couldn't work no more, and she went crazy. Things got so bad that Doc Sinclair finally had to strap her to the bed. The whole town could hear her screaming. Dr. Sinclair was so depressed that he couldn't save her...he blew his head right off.\" as Bo told the two this story in a sad voice but still looked totally unaffected by it. \"That's terrible,\" Carly said to him sadly, pitying the Sinclair family. She thought it was awful for the family to have to go through that, then she thought of Ashley and her awful family life, she and Bo would probably get on great. \"It was worse for the boys, left alone like that. They both ended up in foster homes\" Bo told them before stopping the story as they got to his house, Carly looked at the building and noticed it looked older than the other buildings and definitely lived in. \"Hey, why don't you two hop in. I'll go get the fan belt and I'll give you a ride to your car\" Both wade and Carly protested politely as Bo pointed to his truck \"No, actually, we've got friends picking us up where the road's washed out\" Carly explained kindly pointing in the direction of the road. Bo nodded but still looked determined to take them somewhere \"I'll give you a lift. Least I could do for making Y'all wait\" Carly and Wade looked at each other and couldn't find a reason to say no so they both nodded in agreement. \"Cool, All right\" Wade replied as Bo opened up the door of his truck and Carly jumped in as Wade was about to get in after her when Bo stopped him \"Hey, you need to use the facilities, right?\" Wade nodded as if he suddenly remembered that he asked to use the bathroom. Wade looked at Carly who just nodded as he turned back to Bo \"Yeah. Thanks\" Bo leaned into the car and looked at Carly \"Need to use the can?\" he asked her smiling his charming smile as let out a small laugh \"No, it's okay. I'm fine\" he just smiled at her and shut the door. Carly watched the two walk off together as Wade made a face to her behind Bo's back, Carly smiled at her boyfriend's antics she loved his sense of humor and realized that she wanted to be with him whether they were in his small hometown or New York. She knew she had to talk to him again and explain how she felt but first she had to get out of this town, it was starting to give her the creeps, noticing the sun was going down all Carly could do was wait.[Chapter 16] I looked out the window of Blake's car and shook my head annoyed, we should have just stayed home, I only came for Nick who was tempted by Blake with free tickets to the football game curtsy of his parent's money. I looked at my hands as they twitched, my anxiety was kicking in, leaning forward I pressed every button I could reach just for something to do, maybe some music would soothe my demons right now. Nick and Dalton were both looking at me, Nick's was a knowing look, Dalton's was a worried glance. They both knew what was happening and knew how bad it gets for me, especially in situations I couldn't control. \"Just let me drive, bitch. He gave me the keys, man\" Dalton called to Nick as Nick grabbed my hand trying to help me but my mind was still running fast, I stopped pressing when I heard what Dalton said and turned to him smiling. \"Yeah, that's because he thinks Nick's the one who stole the car and crashed it,\" I told him annoyed feeling Nick squeeze my hand. He was always thankful that I believed it wasn't him when no one else would. I felt calmer now, but I still turned back to the buttons to keep me occupied. Blake would probably want to kick my ass if I fucked up the radio, but he had to have known it was stupid to let Nick, Dalton and I have free reign of his car. \"Whatever. You didn't have to cover for me, dude\" Dalton pouted as Nick and I shared a look, last year Dalton stole a car and took it joy riding, he was drunk obviously. Nick found out about it and covered for him, he got sent to jail for resisting arrest. It was the worst couple of months of my life but I didn't blame Dalton, everyone makes mistakes \"Your jacket's clean, all right? Mine's already got plenty of stains on it. One more's not gonna make a difference\" Nick mumbled as silence enveloped the three of us. I looked at the GPS, the little arrow wasn't even on the road anymore it was like we were driving towards a ghost town, I pressed the buttons on the GPS to see if it was a glitch \"Where the hell is this place? Town's not even on the GPS\" I told the boys they both looked at the screen and frowned. \"That's weird\" Nick replied as he pressed some of the same buttons I did, my anxiety began to creep back in as I gave my boyfriend a soft glare \"Yeah, no shit..\" Carly looked out of the truck windows, the sun was long gone and the only things that were giving out light was the light on the front of Bo's house and a few street lamps; she sighed wondering what was taking them both so long. Noticing the radio she pushed a button trying to get it to work, but it was obviously broken, the truck itself looked like it was on its last life. Carly looked around again and got out the car to stretch her legs. She walked up the stairs and glanced over the house trying to find signs of Wade or Bo coming back, frowning she leaned against the wall crossing her arms. As Carly looked out in the darkness, the hairs on her arms stood on end when she saw the truck she had just been sitting in was missing a headlight, just like the truck that Ashley had hit yesterday. Panicking Carly walked back over to the truck and grabbed her cell, dialing Blake's number as her hands shook, she just hoped that Blake and Paige were close by \"Hey, it's Blake. You know what to do\" frustrated and scared she left a voicemail. \"Guys, where the hell are you? Remember the truck that came to the campsite last night? I think we just ran into him,\" before she could say anything else the front door opened and Bo stepped out, without Wade. Carly hid her phone behind her back when Bo gave her a smile \"Where's Wade?\" she called out nervously, hoping that he was okay and was about to come out of the house any minute so they could get the hell out of this town. Bo looked confused for a minute \"Oh, he's not out here? Guess he's still in the bathroom, then,\" he smirked walking down the stairs holding a box full of car stuff \"I got the fan belt. You're not in a hurry, are you? Because I wanted to load the truck up with some stuff first,\". Carly knew something wasn't right, so she jumped back into the truck locking all the doors, she knew she had to trust her gut on this one, Bo came by the window looking bemused \"What are you doing?\" he asked innocently but Carly could see right through it and stayed where she was \"waiting for Wade\". Throwing the box of car parts Bo circled the truck \"Open the damn door. This is my truck\" he laughed lightheartedly but Carly was getting more scared by the second and was praying for Wade to come and help her. Bo was pulling at the door handles still trying to get into his truck \"Hey, what is the matter with you? If you don't open this door, I'm gonna call the cops\" but Carly knew different she knew Bo wasn't as innocent as he was putting on. The nice guy act for earlier that she fell for was a hoax and Wade could see through it that's why he looked so suspicious of him, he was the man from the campsite but she didn't know what he wanted from them. \"You're the guy from the campsite\" Bo's face changed into something evil looking when he realized she had figured out who he was, he slammed his hand and elbows into the window trying to get to Carly who had begun to scream. He finally broke the window and grabbed Carly's legs who was still shouting for Wade \"What are you doing? Get out of the truck. Stop it. I'm just trying to help you. Give me the keys. Hey. Hey. Stop it, or I'm calling the cops\" Bo shouted at her but she wasn't falling for it this time. In the midst of being grabbed Carly dropped her phone whilst trying to keep a hold on the car seat, Bo grabbed both of her legs and tried to pull her through the broken window. Carly remembered the keys were still in the ignition and started the truck, she pulled the truck into reverse and pushed the pedal with one hand, steering with the other. The truck backed up fast but Bo still had a hard grip on her legs. She pressed down on the brakes hard and felt the grip Bo had on her disappear as he tumbled down the grassy bank, she pulled her legs back through the window breathing hard and sniffing to herself. Carly put the truck back into drive and slammed her foot on the pedal but the truck didn't move an inch, she could hear the wheels squealing and the smell of burning rubber entered her nose, the truck was stuck. She couldn't see Bo anymore, but just because she couldn't see him doesn't mean he's not there waiting for her to get out of the truck so he could grab her, as she pulled the button to turn the headlights on Bo slammed on the hood of the truck making Carly shriek in surprise. Opening the small window behind her she climbed out of it and into the back of the truck tripping over things as she goes, Carly doesn't even look back as she runs as fast as she can. She needed to put as much distance between her and Bo as she could, she knew Blake would be on his way to pick them up but she didn't know if her or Wade would be there or if Bo would find her first, remembering her boyfriends Carly let out a small sob \"Oh god, Wade\"[Chapter 17] We were still in Blake's car as the music I found softly played around us \"So...\" I looked at Dalton as did Nick wondering what he was going to say this time, Dalton thinking is never a good idea. \"... you think Carly and Wade are gonna stay together when she moves to New York?\" Dalton asked innocently, Dalton has had the biggest crush on Carly for like forever and he's always thought he had a chance and then Wade came along. \"... Because she be looking at me sometimes like...\" I shook my head laughing, everyone knew about Dalton's little crush even Carly but she never reciprocated his feelings and I don't think she ever would. \"Dalton, it ain't happening\" Dalton looked at me shocked and Nick just laughed knowing what I was getting at \"What? What do you mean?\" Dalton questioned looking flabbergasted as Nick looked at D very serious like he was in big brother mode which he didn't show too much of these days. \"And even if it was happening... it ain't happening. Nothing personal\" Dalton looked crushed as I looked at Nick with a grin \"God your hot,\" I told him smiling to myself, Nick was very sexy when he was being protective which is one of the reasons I fell in love with him. Nick held my hand and I could see him smiling as Dalton made a gagging sound before frowning at us \"Why? You like me better than Wade, right?\" he asked looking from me to Nick seeing if we agree with him. I sighed at my friend as I put my chin on the back of Nick's seat \"There is nothing wrong with Wade D\" I told him feeling a like I had to stick up for the small-town boy for Carly's sake, I was amazed when Nick shrugged his shoulders nodding \"Yeah, Wade's not so bad\". Dalton looked between the two of us thoughtfully \"Yeah, I like Wade too\" I chuckled and shook my head in amusement, Dalton does actually like Wade but he lets Nick do the thinking for both of them which usually mean that anyone Nick dislikes Dalton dislikes too. \"You'll find the girl for you D, and she'll be someone who likes you for you,\" I tell him as he gives me a small smile and blushed \"Yeah?\" he questioned like I had told him a secret \"Mhmm. That's what love is, someone who knows your faults and still loves you anyway\". Carly was running through the dark town when it all suddenly came to life, the lights turned on and everything seemed reanimated. Carly could feel the tears running down her face she knew she knew she wasn't leaving here without Wade but she had no idea where he was. Glancing around the town around the town and spotted the church she started running hoping the priest would still be in there, maybe he could call the police for her or at least hide her away from Bo until her friends came. \"Help. Please, somebody\" she screamed running through the doors but stopped still when she noticed the people in the church were the same people as before and none of them had moved as she walked around the people she noticed something terrifying. They weren't real, they were all wax. Carly looked at all the different people and couldn't understand why the church was full of wax figures especially when Bo had been in here for a funeral service earlier, he said someone special to him had passed. Walking backward looking at the scary expressions of the wax figures she bumped into something, she shrieked whirling around and saw she had accidentally broken one of the arms off a wax figure, with a gasp she realized that there was a person inside the wax. Looking up quickly at the figures again her stomach tightened when she realized just how life like they were and why they were, everyone here was made of wax, like literally real people were inside the wax-sculptures. Breathing heavily Carly's thoughts raced, A wax house and real people encased in wax 'How was this happening and why?' She thought to herself noticing a pamphlet in the hand of one of the figures and looked at it, it said 'Trudy Sinclair' that was the woman who Bo was talking about. Placing the pamphlet back Carly turned and glanced at the casket that Bo was by earlier nervously, taking a step closer Carly wasn't shocked to see that 'Trudy' was made out of wax as well. So when she and Wade had walked in earlier they hadn't interrupted a service, these people were already dead and by the looks of their aging esthetic they had been here a very long time but then why had Bo told them it was a funeral? Hearing footsteps of someone about to enter the church Carly hid quickly and tried to keep quiet, listening out she could hear the doors open and looked out of her hiding spot and saw that it was Bo. Closing her eyes tight Carly could still hear his footsteps \"I'm sorry, Mama. These people just have no respect\" Mama? Was he talking to Trudy Sinclair, was Trudy his mother, so he was one the boys he was talking about earlier. Carly could feel the tears falling down her face again, if he could encase his own mother in wax then she didn't want to think about what he would do to her if he caught her, she waited to hear him leave but minutes passed and it had gone quiet in the church. Just as she thought he had left to find her, thinking maybe he didn't know she had hidden in here two hands grabbed her from under the priests cloak making her scream in horror, pushing the hands away from her she jumps up and ran out of the church. Bursting through the church doors she ran as fast as she could through the town but she wasn't quick enough as Bo tackled her to the floor and held her down and struggled to keep her from screaming. Carly saw a woman pull back her curtains and look out into the street as Carly tried to scream at her \"Help! Help, please! Will you help, please?! Over here! Help me!\" Bo looked up to see who she was screaming at and just smirked knowingly as Carly gave up screaming and looked at Bo terrified \"What are you gonna do to me?\"[Chapter 18] I looked up from my phone when I felt Nick stop the car suddenly \"What's going on?\" I followed the guys when they got out of the car and groaned seeing a lot of water was covering the road and we wouldn't be able to drive through it. \"Are we here?\" I asked Nick who nodded to me \"Yeah, over there\" he answered nodding to the road on the other side of the water, looking at the water in thought I knew we'd be leaving the car behind and walking to get Carly and Wade who were probably pissed at us for being so late. \"Well, should we drive through it, you think?\" Dalton questioned scratching his head as I looked at him with a small smirk \"Through all that?\" I questioned him knowing he would still want us to try. Nick shook his head in amusement as Dalton shrugged his shoulder \"I don't know. I could do it\" Nick shrugged and gave the keys to Dalton standing by my side as we both looked at Dalton expectantly. \"That's what I thought\" Nick laughed grabbing my hand and pulling me toward the town of Ambrose \"God I hope they got their fan belt, I just want to sleep and go home,\" I said aloud as Nick helped me through the water. Bo kicked the door of the garage open with Carly struggling on his shoulder \"Put me down! No\" Carly tried to grab everything she could to help her but she could get hold of anything, Bo gripped her tighter and pulled her again as she let out a lost cry. Stopping at a radio Bo turned on loud metal music so no one could hear her screams and started to walk down to the basement with Carly still struggling and screaming, she knew if he got her down the basement she wouldn't be coming back up. \"No. Let me go! Please\" Carly pleaded bouncing on Bo's shoulder as he walked downs, feeling herself being thrown down Carly squirmed and fought as Bo duct taped her wrists to the metal of the chair. When he grabbed her legs and started taping them Carly noticed that his wrists were badly scarred like someone had bound him to something, it hit her hard if Wade didn't find her now, nobody was going to ever again. After walking through the town we stopped outside the garage Wade and Carly said they were going to be at but we couldn't see them, there was loud music playing but we still couldn't find anyone. \"Hello?\" I shouted walking into the garage \"Carly? Wade? Hello?\" I tried to shout loud to be heard over music but I still didn't get a response \"hmm\" I turned to Nick and shrugged my shoulders \"there's music playing, but I don't think anyone's here\" Nick shook his head looking annoyed. I walked up to him and curled my arm around his waist trying to get some heat of him he started pulling me with him in a different direction \"Wait. Where are we going now?\" I looked up at him confused we were supposed to be looking for Carly. \"To that grocery store we passed. I'm thirsty.\" I rolled my eyes Nick wasn't bothered that we couldn't find his sister in the one place she said she would be and it wasn't like Carly to not be where she said she would be. I glanced up to see Dalton looking torn \"Well, what about your sister and Wade, man?\" he said timidly not wanting to upset Nick but his feelings for Carly made him want to know she's safe, I looked up at Nick in disapproval \"What?!\" he asked me frustrated. \"I don't know Nick! We came all this way. You don't think we should look for them?\" I questioned him sarcastically \"This isn't like Carly, this is where she said they'd be\" I mumbled tapping my thigh incessantly. Nick grabbed my hands gently \"Check it. We'll go this way. Dalton, you go that way. We don't find them, meet here, go back to the road. Cool?\" he looked at Dalton and me to gauge our reactions. Dalton was biting his nails still anxious about finding Carly but I shook my head \"I think it's best if I stay here in case they come back\" I told them and Dalton nodded quickly in agreement as he looked around almost nervously. Nick seemed disappointed but nodded anyway knowing I wouldn't change my mind \"Okay, stay right here. Don't go anywhere\" I nodded silently watching as Nick and Dalton both walk off in different directions and sighed hoping one of them would find Carly and Wade so we could leave. It had been a couple of minutes and still no sign of Carly or Wade I was getting worried, maybe they had gone to the store for something and Nick was with them right now. Biting my lip I pulled out my phone when I felt two strong hands grab me from inside the garage \"what the fuck!\" I shouted as I fought back against the strong grip on me but I wasn't able to break free. Someone threw me over their shoulder and I struggled with the tall and built man so I could grab some of the heavy tools lying around to hit him with but he was always one step ahead of me, pressing the buttons on my phone that I still held in my hand I tried to call Carly. Obviously hearing the beeping from my cell phone the guy growled pulling me from his shoulder and held me by the waist as we wrestled over my phone \"shit!\" I swore as he grabbed it from my hand and crushed it under his foot. Kicking and screaming I was picked up again as he dragged me down into a grimy-looking basement where the man slammed the door shut behind us, growling I started hitting his back. I stopped seeing Carly strapped to a chair looking rough and crying, she looked at me shocked and shouted for me to help her \"Carly?!\" I gasped as I felt the man trying to carry me somewhere and I guessed I was about to be tied up like my best friend. Hitting and scratching I was doing everything in my power to stop him but I still wasn't strong enough, fuck I was angry at this guy, kneeing him in the head I sighed in relief when he dropped me and I ran to the other side of the room. I heard Carly shout my name, I looked at her and she calmly said to me \"Your parents never really loved you, you were never good enough for them. They loved their drugs more.\" I felt my blood boil as I suddenly felt the same anger I always felt when I thought about my parents \"What the fuck, Carly?\" I shouted surprised as my body shook she knew that was a tough subject for me but then I heard her shout \"use it Ashley\" and it dawned on me. I turned to the man as he gave me a dirty grin and knocked him over in pure anger, I tackled him like Nick had shown me back in high school, it was pure force and the guy was obviously surprised at my strength. Climbing on top of his body I felt the adrenaline coursing through me, punch after punch I fought harder thinking about the two people who had ruined my life and made me a monster. \"Get angrier!\" Carly shouted as I let out a scream completely letting go of my need to get my anger together \"Fuck you! Fuck you!\" I chanted as the man tried to get me off him, this is what happens when I get angry, I turn into someone I didn't want to be but I guess right now I needed to be this person. I felt a hard knock to my head and fell to the side groaning holding a hand to my head, leaning on all fours I looked up to see a metal pipe drop from the mans hands as I felt the world spin, there was nothing I could do this time as he grabbed me and strapped me to the bed in the corner \"You bastard\" I groaned as he tightened his grip on my arms. The man leaned into me and whispered in my ear \"I knew you were gonna be feisty ever since you broke my headlight but I never knew you were gonna be this feisty I might just keep you for myself\" he kissed the top of my head and smiled at me. I could hear Carly screaming at 'Bo' to leave me alone, looking at his mechanic suit I noticed the name Bo stitched onto it \"Mm, a nice little housewife. waitin' for me in bed after a long day of work\" I was too disgusted and angry to retort to his wanting to keep me but I knew I had to show him I wouldn't play his games. Still dizzy I pulled my head back and threw it forward with all the force I had left and hit him straight in the face \"Holy shit\" I groaned as I saw black spots dancing in front of my eyes as I listened to Bo's swearing and Carly calling my name.[Chapter 19] Nick walked back up to the garage after not being able to get into the grocery store and frowned when he couldn't see Ashley in front of the garage, he told her to stay where she was but he also knew she was very stubborn. He saw a guy walking out of the garage and locking the door \"Hey. I'm looking for my sister and her boyfriend. They were looking for a fan belt or something\" he asked the guy who just shrugged his shoulders. Nick noticed he was sweaty and out of breath which would be normal if the guy had been working on cars but he wasn't anywhere to be found ten minutes ago, he also looked like he had been in a fight with someone. \"I don't think I've seen them,\" The guy said trying to walking away, he was getting annoyed with this dudes attitude \"This is the only gas station in town, right?\" maybe they had gone to a different garage to find Wade fan belt. Nick heard the guy sigh angrily \"That's right\" he muttered closing the shutter door as Nick looked around to see if he could see Ash or Dalton or well anybody that was supposed to be here. \"Yeah, then they were definitely here\" he sighed frustrated he just wanted to find everyone and leave, this town was starting to get to him and he had been in prison but this town felt a lot creepier. \"I just told you, I didn't see them\" the man was watching Nick's every move \"Does somebody else work here?\" Nick questioned looking around trying to see if he could see another employee. \"No, I own the station\" the man laughed walking towards Nick \"And I would've seen them.\" Nick looked at him suspicious something we definitely up he just knew it \"Well, I was just here a few minutes ago, and you didn't see me\" This guy looked more and more agitated every time Nick spoke, \"my girlfriend was here too but now she's gone, did you see her?\". The mechanic looked at Nick in interest as a small smirk appeared on his face \"Girlfriend huh? Nope sorry. Can't help you\" A muffled noise came from somewhere and Nick looked around warily as the gas station guy was sweating and looked tense \"What was that?\". The man shrugged still looking very anxious \"Nothing. That was just my dog. Actually, you know what? My brother Vincent was down here for a while. He could've helped your sister out. They could be up at the house\" he said pointing towards his house on the hill as he bent down like he was about to tie his shoelace. Nick turned to see what he was looking at \"No, my friend went that way earlier\" Nick said watching him standing back up smirking and putting something in his pocket \"Really? Well, maybe he ran into my brother up there, then. Wanna head up to the house?\" Bo questioned seeming a little too nice now. Nick thought about it but still something didn't add up this dude was being way too pushy about going to his house but if it was where Carly was he didn't care \"Yeah, whatever\" They start walking to the house in awkward silence as Nick hoped he'd find Ashley along the way. Nick looked at the guys shirt and say the name Bo and figured this was the 'Bo' the creepy hillbilly was talking about this morning at the roadkill pile \"So, what's your sister look like anyway?\" Bo asked as a noise came from behind them. Nick was just about to answer when he heard a scream, his sister's scream \"Nick! Nick, help me!\" he turned back to run when Bo tried to stab him with something but Nick quickly dodged it and sent a punch into Bo's face twice. Nick ran towards the garage locking the door behind him as Bo reached it and banged it loudly before stopping quickly, Nick saw Bo running to the shutter door and jumped on it just as it was being pulling it up, looking around quickly he shoved a screwdriver in the lock to jam it. Nick ran back to the front door as Bo disappeared from sight but as he looked out into the darkness Bo was nowhere to be seen he looked up and down the street but still couldn't see him, he just hoped Ashley was with Dalton and not out there alone. \"Nick!\" his attention was pulled back to his twin sister but had no idea where she was \"Carly!\" he shouted looking around \"I'm downstairs!\" Nick ran down a set of stairs and came to a door he pushed it but it didn't budge. He guessed it was locked and he took a couple of steps back kicking it open, he could see his sister lying on a gurney with her hands and legs taped together. \"Thank God\" she whispered her head against the side of the gurney looking exhausted \"Jesus\" he gasped she looked terrible her mouth was bleeding and she looked like she had been roughed up. Nick ran to her side feeling bad for letting his sister go with that redneck in the first place especially when Ash told him he shouldn't have let her go, he should have gone too but he was a stubborn asshole \"Okay. I'm here. I got you\" he told her gently as he started undoing her restraints when she began whimpering. Nick had never felt so much anger as he was feeling now, he was finally able to feel how Ashley feels most of the time, somebody had hurt his little sister and he wasn't able to protect her. \"Watch my finger. Watch my finger\" Nick was so wrapped up in his thoughts he didn't see Carly was missing half of her finger he felt disgusted that he let this happen, he definitely should have gone with her instead of Wade who was coincidentally not here with Carly \"Oh, my God. He did this to you?\" \"Nick\" Carly said with tears running down her face as her brother fussed over her but he wasn't listening he was trying to form a plan but as soon as she said Ashley's name he stopped \"I don't know where she is Carly I left her for 5 minutes and when I come back she was gone, I just hope to god she's safe\". Throughout his upset rambling Carly was still trying to call his name he looked at her and saw her point to the corner of the room, turning to follow her line of view Nick's stomach dropped when he looked to see a body, Ashley's body. Nick ran over as fast as he could screaming her name but she wouldn't wake he tried shaking her but nothing was working, he felt a couple of tears running down his face and turned to Carly who looked at him shocked. \"Has she still got a pulse?\" Carly asked hopeful she didn't mean for Ashley to get hurt, she had no idea that Bo would hit her with a metal pipe, she thought that if Ash got angry enough she would be able to overpower Bo and get them both out of here. Nick pushed two of his fingers on Ashley's neck gently praying that she was still alive her head was covered in blood and he could see she had been hit with something big, he knew Bo had hurt both of his sister and girlfriend and now he was definitely pissed off. He could feel the soft bumps of Ashley's pulse and sighed with relief \"She's alive\" Carly gave a cry of happiness but she suddenly just remembered about Bo \" Where is he?\" Nick didn't want to leave Ash's side but knew he had to start to look for weapons ignoring his sister as he tried to think of a plan. \"Where is he?\" Carly asked for a second time sounding more desperate, Nick looked at her and started cutting through the tape on her legs \"I locked him out. Where the hell's Wade?\" Nick angry knowing that Wade didn't protect her but he couldn't help feel disturbed he knew Wade would die to protect Carly and he just hoped that's not what's happened. Carly drew in a sad breath she hadn't thought about Wade since she had run from the wax museum screaming, she just couldn't think of him knowing that something has probably happened to him. \"I don't know. He went into the house\" She explained to Nick whilst wrapping her finger in a bit of her torn of shirt \"This place is a freak show\" They both heard a groan and swearing \"Oh son of a motherfucking whore!\" Nick smiled automatically knowing it was Ashley, they both ran to her side, Nick was the first to her and grabbed her into a big hug. Carly hugged them both happy knowing that Ashley was awake and alive, Nick grinned he couldn't help but think of how lucky he was that Carly loved Ashley as much as he did. Something he hadn't returned when Carly introduced Wade to him but back then in his eyes the small town boy wasn't good enough for his sister, not that he told his sister that he just let her believe that he hated Wade. Nick and Carly let go of Ashley who just looked up and darkly told them \"If you haven't killed him yet he'll wish he was dead when I get hold of him\" The twins looked at each other thinking the same thing 'I wouldn't want to be Bo right now!'[Chapter 20] I could see the twins looking at me worriedly they knew they had poked the bear and I had been awoken, I wasn't going to let this go Bo hurt my family and none one make me bleed my own blood if that fucker wants a fight he's definitely going to get one. Jumping down of the chair I held my head feeling a little dizzy, looking around for a weapon I noticed everything in here would cause a lot of damage but it would slow us down if we needed to run. The sound of an engine starting made us all jump \"He's leaving\" Nick told looking at the roof like he could see straight through it, the three of us stared up until a thought hit me. \"But why?\" I questioned as Nick ushered us to the steel door \"he's got us all trapped here?\" I said as Carly looked at me worried, grabbing her I pulled her behind me as we all crept back up the stairs. Nick was holding my hand tightly and I was holding Carly's good hand, I felt her grab onto me like a constricting boa like if she had let go she would lose us. \"All right, stay here\" Nick left us on the stairs so he could go and look out for Bo \"Hey are you okay?\" I asked Carly as she looked at me breathing heavily and nodded but I knew she wasn't. Turning to her I grabbed her face in my hands and smoothed her hair away from her face \"I won't let him hurt you again, okay?\" Carly nodded as tears rolled down her cheeks. Pulling her into my chest I held her tight \"I'm here, you're safe\" I mumbled into her hair as she shook, peering over at Nick I saw him look out of the window before he nodded to me \"Come one Car\" I whispered pulling the older girl behind me. I glance around the room and found a toolbox I grabbed the hardest thing out of it, a wrench. I turned to Carly and Nick they both looked like they didn't know what to do. \"All right. The car's by the road\" I started before remembering \"Damn it, Dalton's got the keys\" I felt my breath catch in my throat, Dalton, we had forgotten all about him. \"We gotta call the cops\" Nick mumbled as he ran into the office and picked up the phone from the wall \"Shit\" he groaned throwing the phone down and putting his hands on his head looking more panicked than I've ever seen him. Nick looked at me and Carly \"where's your cell phones?\" I looked on the dirty garage floor to see the broken remnants of my cell phone which Bo had crushed when taking me down to the basement \"which part of it?\" I huffed crossing my arms. Nick looked expectantly at Carly \" It might be in the truck up near the house. What about Wade? I think he has him too. What if he turns him to wax?\" I could feel my face morph into a look of question and that question was of Carly's sanity. \"What do you mean, wax?\" Nick asked his twin sister gently, maybe all this was too traumatizing for her, she shook her head in fear \" You don't get it. They're all wax, everyone. No, wait\" she says after a moment of realization. She opens the door started walking towards a row of houses as Nick and looked at each other confused but ran after her as we see she was stood in front of a house \" There was a woman in here. She was alive. She pulled the curtain back\" Carly said as she opened the gate for us. Nick jumped over the fence and tried to look through the window when the curtain was pulled back by a woman made of wax making Nick yell \"The whole town is rigged\" I looked at Carly worried, how the hell were we going to get out of here. \"You're saying, that's a real person underneath?\" I asked disturbed looking at the face of the elderly wax lady, I heard Carly sigh in relief knowing we believed her \"Yes. At the church, they were all like that. At least 20 more\" I couldn't help but think of Dalton and wonder if he was in trouble. I heard Carly and Nick talking but I was too busy thinking about Dalton, I felt Nick grab my arm \"Come on\" I stood still when he tried to move me and shook my head \"I can't\". Carly looked at me confused \"Why what's wrong\" I shook my head and took a deep breath \"I need to go and find Dalton\" I whispered as rubbing my hands against my jeans as they began to sweat from fear and adrenaline. I heard Nick disagreeing with me but I carried on \"If we wait until after we find Wade he could be hurt or dead, we need to split up\" Nick looked unconvinced \"I'll meet you by the house with Dalton\" I told him in a stern voice. Knowing I would go anyway he grabbed me by the shoulder and looked me in the eyes \"I love you\" I smiled and held my wrench tighter \"I love you too\" turning to Carly I grabbed her face in my hands as she began to cry again \"I want you to stay with Nick, Okay?\". She nodded and wrapped her arms around me tight \"Please come back\" she whispered to me as I gave her a comforting smile \"have I ever let you down?\" giving Nick once last nod I turned and began the walk to the wax house. Looking all around paranoia had set in, I was watching my back in case Bo decided to jump out and grab me again but I knew I had to put on my big girl pants and go find my friend from whatever situation he had surely gotten himself into. Walking up the steps to the wax house I put my hand on the wall to steady myself \"Oh my god, it's wax too\" I groaned feeling the greasy texture of the wall, I took a deep breath and opened the door quietly the lights were on but nobody was home. I could hear music and started walking towards it slowly but the closer I walked I could also hear screaming and pleading Dalton! I grabbed the sharp metal shrapnel I found at the garage out of my boot and looked around the cellar door to see Dalton on the floor crying and a giant man with knives in the air ready to attack. With the biggest battle cry I could muster I threw myself at the big man and stabbed him in the crease of his shoulder and neck, I heard the man muffle a scream as Dalton shouted my name in relief. Jumping off the guys back I grabbed Dalton's hand and ran, as we made our way through the Wax museum I stopped in a room that had a piano and saw something that actually made me feel sorrowful for the first time since we left home \"Wade\" I whispered seeing him sitting at the piano with half of his jaw on show. Hearing the man's groans I shook myself knowing Wade couldn't be helped and I needed to get Dalton and myself out alive \"Come on\" I said pulling on Dalton's arm making him run with me again, getting outside I didn't stop until I knew we were safe. Dalton and I stood trying to get our breaths back as I stood up straight I looked at him fully, he was white as a sheet \"Are you okay?\" he looked at me for a minute before throwing his arms around me and holding onto me tightly letting himself cry \"Thank you, Ash, you saved my life\". Patting his arms I was just glad he was here with me \"I wasn't about to leave you behind D\" he nodded slowly and I knew he was in shock, I held his hand again and walked towards Bo's house knowing that's where Nick and Carly were heading.[Chapter 21] As the house came into view I saw Nick and Carly crouched behind a fence, walking over to them I slowly slid behind them and looked over their shoulders to see what they were looking at \"What are we looking at?\" I whispered to Carly as she let out a small scream. \"Ashley\" she called hitting me before pulling me into a hug \"Thank god\" she mumbled as I saw Nick smiling at me over her shoulder \"Have I ever let you guys down\" I repeated myself again as they both gave a laugh. Then they both noticed Dalton and looked they were going to cry, they both greeted him in their own way, Carly with a big hug and Nick with a man shake hug thing \"So now we've all established that we're alive and well. What's the plan?\". Carly ran up to the truck seemingly ignoring me \"God who parked that thing\" I mumbled as Carly ran back over to us \"It's not in there\" I looked at her confused until I remembered about her phone \"Bo must have taken it\" Nick said as we all looked at the house. \"Wade went in there and never came out\" Carly whimpered obviously thinking about her boyfriend, I looked a Dalton and shook my head, she didn't need to know right now, Dalton seemed to understand me and nodded. Nick looked over at the two of us and frowned, I just shook my head and pulled my finger across my neck signifying Wade was dead, Nick sighed and rubbed a hand over his face \"All right. We'll go in quick, one pass. If we can't find them, we have to get the hell out of here\". I looked at Nick shocked as he let out a sigh when Carly passed him \"Let her look, when she sees he not there we can leave\" Nick whispered to D and I as we nodded solemnly, Dalton walked up by Carly as Nick and I walked a step behind them. \"So he's dead? Are you sure?\" Nick questioned as I looked at him \"He was encased in wax with half of his face chopped of Nicholas, I'm sure\" I hissed as we all tip toed up to the house and saw the lights we off. \"Let's try the back. Stay close\" Nick whispered to us as we walked into the house, it was eerily quiet and looked a mess \"Wade?\" Carly called out desperately making us all we all turn to her with wide eyes \"Shh\". We all started looking around for everything and anything to help us \"Nick. Nick, there's guns\" Carly gasped as I walked up to her and smashed the glass only to realize that it was connected to the wall \"It's bolted to the wall\". I sighed looking at Carly \"There's gotta be a key around here somewhere\" she told me and I nodded helping her look through the draws when we found old newspaper clippings about conjoined twins I nudged Carly and passed her the clippings, we heard a bang outside and dropped the clippings to hide. \"Oh shit, hide\" I croaked out trying to find a hiding spot, the door swung open and Bo dragged himself through the door holding his chest and arm which had arrows through it I looked at Carly who just sheepishly shrugged as I gave her a proud smile. I watched Bo walk into the kitchen and heard a tap being run, I watched as he began to pull the arrow through his arm, then he wrapped a cloth around his arm. I quickly shut my eyes when I heard him being sick that was something I didn't need to see. Looking the other way I saw Nick walk into a room and wondering where he was going I looked over to Carly who shrugged at me, hearing another car outside I walked over to the window with Carly following me and saw Paige's dead body in the bed of a truck. \"No\" I heard Carly whisper next to me and I put my arm around her \"Quick\" I told her hearing Bo walking towards us I quickly pushed Carly under a table and climbed under myself before he saw us, I watched him look out of the window disgusted \"Fuck!\" he limped towards the door slowly \"Goddamn it. I told him not to do that\". He opened the door and began to shout at the person outside \"Hey, you don't ever leave here without me. You know better than that. Don't be so stupid\" I gasped seeing the big man who was trying to kill Dalton and whom I stabbed, he was holding his shoulder in pain \"What's the matter with you?\" he asked rhetorically. Bo walked back into the kitchen where the big man following him, getting up slowly I went back to my original hiding spot so I could see what was going on, I saw the big guy try to touch the arrow still sticking out of Bo's chest \"Don't\" Bo shouted smacking the man's hand. The other man tried to help again \"I said don't. Get. Get. Fucking freak\" Bo yelled at him like a dog, the man got a spoon out of the draw and heated it up, I noticed that half of his face was made of wax and he was smoothing it with the heated spoon. Bo stood by the man watching him smooth out his wax face \"Hey, the town's looking real good. We almost finished what Mama started. Those two are good. They'll fit perfect. What'd I tell you, huh? Isn't your work more real now? Ma would be proud\". Ma? So these two were brothers, so this is what they did they kidnapped people and turned them into wax for their mother \"Yeah, she'd be real proud. She always said that your talent would make up for what God took away from you. Now, there's a few more. We still got a lot of work to do.\" Bo told his brother as I thought of his words. \"Now there's a blonde one out there, I want her, okay?\" I frowned to myself knowing I was the blonde one, I saw the brother nod obediently as Bo smirked, he obviously wanted to kill me himself probably for putting up such a fight. Then my breath hitched I remembered what he said to me in the garage after he finally got me strapped down to the chair, I might just keep you for myself , His grin was so maniacal and held a hidden meaning, then I realized Bo wasn't trying to kill me, he was trying to keep me for himself. Whatever sick plan Bo had cooked up I was smack bang in the middle of it, if we didn't get out of this town soon I was about to become some crazy guys toy, something he would play with when he wanted and control forever.[Chapter 22] Slowly moving away from the door I felt like I was underwater from the information I just learned, if we don't get out of here soon I was about to become the rednecks' wife . Feeling an arm around my waist and a hand over my mouth I gasped to myself. Trying to pull away from the hold I soon stopped moving when Nick's voice echoed into my ears as he shushed me, pulling away I spun around to see Nick and Dalton who had had Carly curled into his arms \"It's okay, it's okay. All right\" Nick said holding his hands up in defense seeing my glaring. Looking at Carly I frowned as she let out a little sob \"We saw Paige's body. she's dead\" I saw Dalton and Nick lower there heads in sadness for our dead friend but Nick soon looked up with a new determination \"We gotta go. Now \". Nick ushered us down a cellar door and into an underground tunnel which was pitch black except for the little light above the generator \"Damn\" I said trying to strain my eyes to see the end of the tunnel \"I can't see anything\" Dalton complained as I sighed \"No shit D\". \"There's gotta be a light here somewhere\" Nick commented as he looked at a panel next to the generator and he started flipping the switches \"Do you even know what you're doing?\" Carly questioned as she began flipping switches too until all the lights came on. \"Come on\" Nick ordered pushing softly against the small of my back as we all walked down the hall cautiously until we came to a room that kind of looks like a torture room from a horror film \"What the fuck?\" I questioned looking around in wonder. \"Holy shit\" I gasped quietly seeing a body in some kind of contraption covered from head to toe in wax looking on a small table next to the wax body I picked up a gold 'bling' chain from it and knew who it was immediately. \"Nicky\" I held up the chain and realization played across everyone's faces \"Blake\" Nick muttered looking defeated, Bo must have killed them and brought Blake here to turn into wax and 'play' with, I felt sick realizing Paige was left on her own, dead, at the campsite she hated being alone. Nick walked forward to the chair \"I'll get you out of there\" he promised as he grabbed the metal bit connected to Blake's head and pulled breaking Blake's head away from his body, I sucked in a deep breath as Nick sighed sadly. Putting Blake's chain in my pocket I walked towards Nick touching his arm in comfort not really know what to say or do until I heard Carly scream \"That's Vincent\" I looked at her confused at her sudden terrified cry \"Who's Vincent\". Turning to see the man who tried to kill Dalton coming down the long underground tunnel we walked through earlier and I noticed he had knives with him \" Oh \" I let out shortly as Nick ran forward to attack Vincent who just pushed him aside. Carly ran at him next with a baseball bat but he just picked her up and threw her like a rag doll accidentally hitting a lever and turning on a fire, looking at the big guy I noticed was and had only been focused on one person since he walked out of that tunnel, me. Vincent looked over to me angrily probably remembering how I had shouted when I jumped on his back, how I had stabbed him in the neck to save my friend and the pain I had caused him with a blade similar to the one he now held tight in his grasp. I gulped knowing he was here now and I knew he was told not to kill me but would he still hurt me, not wanting to give him the choice I gritted my teeth and ran at the giant man gasping when he caught me in his arms and throwing me back into Dalton's chest. We both grunted as we fell to the floor in a heap \" Damn it \" I huffed as Dalton help me stand back up, pushing my friend away I ran at Vincent again stilling when I felt his knife stabbing me in the stomach, my firsts curled into his coat as I looked up at his face which now looked down at me in shock. Vincent let me go almost softly as I staggered back only just seeing the blur of Nick throwing Vincent away from me as I fell back against the wall, my hand pressed to my side as I felt a warmth coming from my wound. Looking down at my hand I noticed it was covered in blood as the feeling of shock rushed over me I noticed Carly was still on the ground, clutching my bleeding stomach I ran to Carly and pulled her up against my side \"Come on, Carly. Get up please!\". Dalton noticed my grimacing when Carly leaned on me and looked down to where my hand was held against my bleeding stomach, he looked at me worried I just smiled sadly with tears in my eyes I knew it was bleeding out a lot, this place would be my grave. Nick ran behind us and pulled a chain releasing wax and creating a firewall between us and Vincent \"Come on lets go\" My boyfriend shouted as I pushed Dalton towards him shaking my head, showing him not to say anything about my current situation \"Let's go \" I shouted at him as he looked between the back of Nick and in my eyes. He finally let out an exasperated sigh before running with Nick to find a way out, Carly and I huddled together as we followed the boys through another underground and into the house of wax, this must be how they're trapping people. Running up the stairs I see a familiar staircase looking at the wax heads in the walls I remember this is where I found Dalton no wonder he was acting weird, this is where he would have died had I not come back to save him. Jogging up the stairs I push Carly in front of me in case Vincent somehow made it throw the fire Nick had created \"this way\" getting to the top of the stairs I realized Nick and Dalton had raced so far ahead of us I couldn't see them anymore. \"This way,\" I told Carly whose breath was coming out heavy, she sounded exhausted but I knew we couldn't stop now, we had to get out of this place. I didn't care if we made it to the car before I died but I am not going out in a town like this. Ashley Rivers does not give up that easily, we just had to get out of this stupid museum, I could do it. I just needed to hold on long enough to make it to the washed out road but even I knew that there was nothing around here for miles, I knew my survival was bleak at best. Suddenly feeling Carly stop in front of me I realized she had stopped dead seeing a wax wade sitting at a piano \"No. Oh, my God. Wade\" I pulled her arm knowing she wouldn't move otherwise \"No, Ashley please\" she gasped looking at her lost loves face \"I know, I know\" I chanted pulling her into me as she sobbed \"Come on, we have to go now. He's gone Car\" I could feel a tear running down my face, too many people have died already.[Chapter 23] Running through the open door of the foyer my blood ran cold seeing Bo smirking at us as he beat the crap out of Nick \"You sick fuck\" Nick told Bo as he was hit in the face again, I froze feeling numb as the love of my life was being punched again and again until he hit the floor. Looking around I noticed Dalton was nowhere in sight and I was beginning to panic when Carly uncharacteristically ran at Bo with the baseball bat high in the air and struck him across the back but he turned with a disgusted frown and punched her in the face making her fly across the room. I felt like I was in an out of body experience as I watched the two dearest people in my life get tossed around like rag dolls and I did nothing to help \"Hey Darlin'\" Bo purred as he backed me up into the wall as he breathed hard. My heart hammered against my chest as he put his hands either side of me, trapping my body between him and the wall \"Cat got your tongue?\" he questioned with a grin as he twisted some of my hair in between his fingers. \"Don't touch me\" I hissed knocking his hand away as I felt the blood begin to rush back into my body \"Oh I'm gonna do more than just touch you\" Bo confessed as he suddenly grabbed the back of my head forcefully kissing me. Feeling his fingers wrap in my hair I gave a gasp pain when he pulled at the root, Bo used that to his advantage and slid his tongue into my mouth exploring it roughly. Mustering up some strength I knocked Bo back a little before sending him a hard punch. \"Ooo baby likes it rough huh?\" Bo taunted wiping the blood away from his newly split lip with a smile \"don't worry sweetheart I like it rough too\" Bo started towards me as I sent my leg up in a front kick but he quickly grabbed my leg and pulled me closer as I let out a surprised gasp. Bo pushed me harshly and my back hit the wall but before I could fall down I was once again pinned and this time Bo quickly took no time in making sure I couldn't hit him \"We're gonna have so much fun together\". Feeling his hand running up my skin as the other one held my wrists together I clenched my jaw tight and closed my eyes trying to get angry, trying to fight back, trying to do... something but all I could do was stand there trapped with no way out. \"What the..\" Bo put his hand on my wound and I screamed as it burned \"Vincent\" he growled before he was quickly dragged off me \"Don't touch her!\" Nick shouted as I slipped to the floor, Nick's upper hand was soon lost when Bo hit him with a flurry of punches. Grasping Nick's neck Bo lifted him off the ground in a strength that scared even me, what scared me more was the flames coming up through the floor making everything start to melt. Looking over to Carly's prone body I noticed she still had the bat in her hands, pulling myself over to her I picked up the bat only stopping when a pain surged through me from my stab wound. Glancing over to Nick I saw him twisting the arrow that was still sticking in Bo's chest making him scream as they fell to the floor, Nick straddled Bo and threw some strong punches at him until Bo stabbed Nick in the leg making him scream \"No Nick!\" I shouted as Bo kicked him away. Getting from the floor I noticed Carly was beginning to come to, I gripped the bat tighter watching Bo stand up and I swung the bat hitting him hard across the face sending him back to the ground and then I just kept hitting him. I was hitting him for me, for my friends and for all the innocent people he had killed. I saw the blood coming from him and how silent he had gone but I didn't care, I could hear Carly shouting at me, calling my name, I could feel the heat in the room as the fire got dangerously close but I couldn't stop. The more I hit him, the more deformed his face was and the better I felt. I didn't stop until I heard Nick shout to me \"Ashley, behind you\" I turned around mid-swing to see Vincent walking towards me again, he looked pissed and I started to back away knowing what he was capable of and what he would do to me once he saw Bo laying on the ground. Vincent stopped suddenly gazing down at Bo's body and a muffled scream came from him as he swiftly looked directly at me knowing it was me who did this to his brother. I felt Carly grab my arm pushing me \"Run! Ashley! Run!\" she shouted ushering me upstairs. I could see Vincent following me with a look of hatred and then I heard Nick screaming \"Hey, Vincent. Hey. Vincent. I swear to God if you hurt her... Vincent!\" Running into a room I held onto the bat tighter as Carly shut the door and pushed a wax crib with a wax conjoined baby figures in it against the door. I looked around for anything that could help us, Carly squealed and fell back as I saw Vincent's knife, the same one he had used to stab me, cut through the door like butter and through the conjoined babies making me think of the newspaper clippings we found. I watched in fear as Vincent pulled himself through the door and pushed the cot away grunting, my feet slid as I back into one corner of the room as Carly did the same in the other corner. \"No. Listen to me. Listen to me\" Vincent looked at Carly confused probably wondering why she was talking to him \"I heard you talking. You don't need to do this. You didn't have to listen to your brother. I saw Bo's scars. And the highchairs.\" Carly must have struck a nerve because he swiped his knife as her making her run across the melting bed into my arms as she put her hand up between herself and Vincent \"No! You're not a freak! He was! You don't need to do this.\" It looked like Carly was getting through to him as his face softened, I took this as my cue to sweet talk him \"You're an artist. Bo was lying to you. He used you. Do you really think that your mother would have wanted you to do this?\". I felt Carly tighten her grip on me as she let out a few sobs and it suddenly looked like Vincent was listening until Carly cried out in fear \"Please don't kill us!\" She screamed pulling me out of the room with her as Vincent started to give chase. Nick came running in from nowhere pushing past us to get to Vincent \"Motherfucker!\" he tackled Vincent to the bed and started struggling I tried to walk forward to help him but I was too dizzy I put my hand on my abdomen and saw I was bleeding really badly now, I fell to the floor my eyes becoming blurry all I could do was listen. \"Oh, shit. Ashley! Carly!\" Nick shouted as I heard grunting and fighting \"I'm here,\" Carly's voice said breathless \"Carly, do it! Do it now!\" I had no idea what was going on but I felt lighter and more tired I don't think this was going to end well for me, I think my time is up. I heard a muffled yell and felt the floor shake \"Nick, get up!\" hearing squelchy footsteps I hoped it was Nick and not Vincent \"Oh my god! Ashley\" I heard Carly scream and felt somebody lift me into their arms. \"Ashley! Baby!\" I felt Nick shake me and then my stab wound being touched \"Shit! When did this happen\" Nick growled as I opened my eyes and looked at him exhausted. I smiled at the twins and they looked terrible \"I love you\" I told them Carly chocked out a sob and Nick looked angry \"No don't say that we are getting out of here\" I felt him pick me up and screamed out as my body was too tired to be strong now. \"How do we get out?\" Nick questioned as he walked further back away from the fire and into the wall, lazily looking over to the stairs I noticed they were completely gone and now the floor was wearing away if we don't get out of here now we'd fall through the floor. \"Nick. The wall\" We both looked to see Carly scratching the wall and I noticed it was coming apart under her nails \"Dig\" she instructed and Nick carefully put me back on my feet careful not to hurt me any more than I already was. I watched Nick move to help dig the wall and tried to help myself but I was more wiping the wax away than digging, I was just too weak, looking over my shoulder lethargically I saw the fire getting closer to us and the floor was curling at our feet \"Faster, Faster\". I turned back to see the twins dig faster and mustered the last bit of strength I had to help dig the last bit \"Go, go! Come on. Come on\" Carly shouted as they pushed me through the small hole we'd dug, clutching the bat like it was my last lifeline I noticed we were in the middle of the 'House of wax' sign. Pushing out some of the letters I groaned we were too high up to jump but luckily for us the whole museum started to collapse and melt from the heat of the fire, just before it melted completely we slid away from the wall and managed to get out of the house alive. Feeling two pairs of arms picking me up I stood back with Nick and Carly to watch the house of wax melt to the ground, taking our friends with it. I looked around to see a figure walking towards us but my body was getting light again \"D?\" I called out as I felt my body shut down and hit the floor.[Chapter 24] I felt my ears ringing as my eyes opened to bright light, I was lay on a something very soft and there was a lot of noise around but I had no idea where I was or what was happening \"Hey that's my camera!\". I opened my eyes to see police, firetrucks, and ambulances everywhere \"That's my camera\" I heard again \"Sorry, son. That's evidence\" I heard a sad sigh come from beside me, I knew that puppy dog sigh \"Dalton?\" I rasped with my throat feeling like sandpaper. Dalton jumped next to me \"Ash?\" he asked quietly almost like he was afraid he'd hurt me \"Where did you go, I thought we'd lost you\" I said sadly as he smirked weakly and ran off making me frown wondering where he went. A Doctor came over to get notes from me \"How am I doc?\" I questioned him nervously he checked my wound \"At the moment we've wrapped the wound and when we get to the hospital we'll get you some stronger pain relief and other standard procedures like scans\". \"Oh, so no biggie\" I smirked as the doctor looked at me wide-eyed \"Ashley!\" I heard and looked over to see Nick, Carly, and Dalton running towards me with big smiles on their faces, I gasped in pain as I was mobbed with hugs. \"Oh, shit sorry\" Dalton mumbled as I looked up at Carly and Nick's faces they looked like they had lost me, grabbing each other their hands I gave them a smile \"When have I ever let you two down\" they both choked out a laugh nodding at me. \"So it's just us?\" I asked and was met with upset faces and the doctor noticed too \"Well, don't worry. We'll get you to the hospital\" I nodded and lay my head down feeling Nick running his hands through my hair I felt my eyes drooping in fatigue. \"What about Vincent\" I questioned my friends \"he went down with the house,\" Carly told me stroking my hair \"And Bo. Did I kill him?\" I asked Nick my voice breaking a little remembering how I felt swinging the bat into his face. Nick leaned down to be level with me and placed his chin on the bar of the stretcher \"you did what you had to do, you saved us and yourself. I saw what he was doing to you. You're a survivor baby\" he whispered to me as he trailed his fingers down the side of my face. Pulling him to me I smiled when he softly kissed me, it was nothing like Bo's forceful kiss, this had passion and love behind it. As Nick stood back up I closed my eyes for a second and let myself rest, there was no one trying to kill me now. \"How could no one have known about all of this?\" Carly asked out loud in disbelief, I thought that myself but even when Nick, D and I were coming to pick up Wade and Carly in Blake's car I noticed it wasn't even on the GPS. My eyes shot open as I felt someone move the stretcher I was lay on but calmed when I saw the doctor leading us to the ambulance, I wasn't in danger anymore, there was no serial killer hiding around the corner waiting to attack me. \"Truth is, this town's hard as hell to get to. It's been abandoned for years, ever since that sugar mill shut down. Hell, it ain't even on the map anymore. We found all those cars in that old factory. Those Sinclair boys pulled people off the interstate for years. If it wasn't for all the smoke from the fire and your friend waving us down, we wouldn't have even known.\" I looked to Dalton who was looking sheepish, he'd obviously gone to find help that's why I couldn't find him. \"Excuse me, sir.\" another officer flagged down the cop talking to us and began talking to him in a hushed voice \"Louis wants to talk to you\" I watched the two go back and forth before the cop turned back to us with a polite smile \"Excuse me\" The police officers walked away and I was pushed into the ambulance where the others sat down around me looking equally exhausted as I felt. \"Maybe there's some good memories on this\" I looked to nick and saw him pull out Dalton's camera out his pocket I gave him a smirk as he waved the camera around \"You took it?\" Carly asked but not in an accusing way. I think this trip has changed us all, I don't think we'll be the same as when we came here. We've all grown up in the last 2 days, trivial things like car thefts, pregnancies, and even my childhood trauma didn't seem so forefront and crippling now. \"It just felt wrong leaving it behind. You know?\" Nick insisted passing it to Dalton who gave him a tearful smile as he held onto it tight, suddenly I remembered the gold chain in my pocket, I awkwardly grab it and placed it in Nick's hand making him falter a little. \"You okay?\" I murmured to him quietly as he grabbed my hand tight in his, I felt the wax around his nails for a second, it was like a reminder of something that was quickly feeling like a distant memory or a nightmare. \"We're okay\" Carly lay her head on Nick's shoulder and he smiled laying his head on top of hers, I glanced at D only to notice his eyes were shut and little snores were coming from his mouth \"We'll be okay\" I corrected knowing it would take time for us all to get better as soon as the shock wears off. Grinning at my family I felt content again, we had been through hell and back, we had lost some people along the way but we still had each other, we still had our lives and I kept my promise of making it out of this stupid little town alive. Looking out of the back windows I saw the creepy guy from the campsite waving at me with a creepy smile on his face whilst stroking a dog, I frowned at him as his creepy smile turned maniacal. Closing my eyes for a second to keep my panic down and trying to tell myself I was safe, I opened them back up to see him waving a bowie knife at me, I bolted up straight as my eyes widened realizing he was in on this whole thing \"No!\". A/N: So that was the last chapter except for the epilogue which is coming up next, as I've started with all my other books if you have any questions or want to read some facts on this book, message me and I'll add it to my Q&A; list![Chapter 25] A few months has passed since Ambrose but we we're still 'hot' news, we've had loads of offers to do interviews or talk shows but none of us really want to relieve what happened, we just wanted to get on with our lives. Some people understood and some thought we were selfish because we wouldn't share our horror story with them like they felt like they deserved it but they'll never understand the pain we went through and the loss we have felt and still feel everyday. Things are somewhat different now between us all Nick told Carly about the car theft that wasn't his fault she was mad at Dalton at first but she understood that Nick would have survived jail better than Dalton. Unfortunately Wade' and Blake's bodies went down with the house so we had to have two empty caskets for them so we filled them both with things that meant a lot to us and them. Paige's body was taken by the corner and we had her buried next to Blake, something I think they'd both love. Dalton had fallen for Lindsay one of the nurses that was taking care of him and some how she fell for his messed up charm too, they've been together for a couple of weeks now and we've realized they're perfect for each other. Carly decided to go to New York after all she felt like Wade and Paige would have wanted her to go even if they're no longer with us. So she packed up and left there were a few tears that night but now she's doing great it's a great opportunity to forget and move on and that's exactly what shes doing. Nick had turned his life around completely, he was no longer the one with a bad attitude and worse temper, he was now working on being a coach for a football team and enjoyed it more knowing he was doing it all himself. He was back on better terms with his parents again and had apologized for being a little asshole, his words not mine, it was nice us all being together especially when we all went for a family dinner at their house. Dinner with the Jones'. And me, everyday is a struggle waking up but when I do I see the one person who made all of this easier for me Nick, one evening as I was washing the dishes I turned to see Nick bent down on one knee and asked me to marry him I said yes of course. I probably would be dead without him. I finally had something that I had always wished my whole life for, a family, the may not be my blood family but I've come to learn over the last few months family doesn't have to be blood. Family can be people who spend time out of their day just to make sure you're okay and to tell you you're safe. As for Dalton's camera we all decided that it wasn't a good time to watch it right now, maybe in 10 years or so, maybe never. It just didn't feel right we didn't want to relieve the past so soon, our wounds were still raw. So right now it was sat on a shelf at mine and Nicks apartment, Lindsay made up keep it as she thought Dalton would secretly watch it without us as to spare us from pain, something he'd grown acoustm to now, he seemed to have mentally aged but was still the same Dalton. So that's us and that's our story a group of friends who thought childhood traumas or internships were the worrying things in our life but we realized that was the least of our worries, our group of 7 friends quickly became a 4 that night, and that will forever be burned into our memories as the night we were Stranded In A Ghost Town.[Chapter 26] Q. Why did Wade have to die? He was my favorite character. A. Well it's mainly because I kept Dalton alive and didn't want to save to many characters. Q. What was wrong with Ashley, did she have mental problems. A. Yes, Ashley has Complex post-traumatic stress disorder. A condition where you experience some symptoms of PTSD along with some additional symptoms, such as: difficulty controlling your emotions, feeling very hostile or distrustful, feeling as if you are permanently damaged or worthless. She also has Intermittent explosive disorder which involves repeated, sudden episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts. Q. Why didn't Dalton die? A. Just because I thought it would be better for him to live and when I was planning a sequel he was in it. Q. Who plays Ashley? A. Teresa Palmer. Q. Why did you rewrite this? A. The first version of this book was terrible, I literally cringed any time I went back to read it. Q. Was Bo in love with Ashley? A. No way, he was more fixated on her, he wanted to break her spirit and put out her fight. Q. I remember before you rewrote that you were doing a sequel are you still doing it? A. I'm really not sure honestly, I mean if everyone wants one I probably will. Q. Will you write an Bo/OC book, sorry it's not a question for this book. A. At some point, yes, I will be. FACTS 1. Ashley wasn't my first name choice for this character but I'm glad I used Ashley for her, I think it suits her better. 2. Ashley's first face claim was Stacy Keibler because I'm a big wrestling fan but after I decided to rewrite she got dropped in favor of Teresa Palmer. 3. The first version of this book only had 12 chapters and all of them were terrible. 4. I had no idea the group were supposed to be college students the first time I wrote this because the actors didn't look as young as college students. 5. My first unpublished draft had only Nick and Ashley surviving. ","Summary":" I started writing this book two years ago now and finished it last year and I've done more books af"},{"Movie":"Oliver & Company","Title":"On Streets of Gold","Author":"AlleyHound","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155328","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The late afternoon foot-traffic became hurried- even more so than usual- as the skies over New York City darkened, making a threat of an imminent downpour. Her senses sharpening in response to the change in atmosphere, a slim, rather scruffy hound weaved through the many sets of legs, driven by a nagging hunger. Rita had been given the responsibility of providing sustenance to Fagin and the gang, something that was becoming a greater challenge as the city descended into winter. Strong winds and scattered downpours made it clear that the change in season was at hand. Not one to complain, Rita nonetheless had little enthusiasm for the wintry weather that was soon to come. Her thin coat and lack of body fat meant that she felt the cold right down to her bones and it took very little for her to become ill and lose weight. It was uncomfortable, sometimes frightening, and always a little embarrassing, and Rita had resolved to be prepared this winter, keeping herself well fed before the cold had a chance to get to her. That though, was easier said than done- opportunities had been rather thin on the ground over the past few days, and everyone was that bit hungrier than usual. Rita had managed to get her paws on small pieces of food, but nothing substantial enough to feed the whole gang. It was frustrating, but nothing she hadn't gotten through before. She wouldn't be going home without food for her family, it was as simple as that. Several months had passed since the gang had gotten out from under the looming shadow of the menacing Sykes, and all in all, life was pretty sweet. Fagin was happier than he'd been in a long time- no longer needing to fear being ripped apart by killer dogs had that effect- and through the summer months the living had been easy. The days were spent running wild around the city, causing trouble, and just hanging out, at ease with the world. Rita knew, however, that they'd have to step up their game again soon. After wandering for a long while, Rita was tempted to a cafe by the smells that wafted her way. While most of the customers were sitting inside out of the way of the cold wind, a couple were sitting outdoors under an umbrella. Rita watched from nearby, waiting for a sign that the diners were sufficiently engrossed for her to make her move. To her delight, the woman's hat was blown from her head, and she hurriedly left the table, followed by her partner who scrambled to help her retrieve it. With both diners distracted, it was a near perfect opportunity, and Rita rushed in to grab whatever of their lunch that she could. Her attempt to snatch the man's steak was made the more difficult by table cloth which was flapping around in the way of her face, preventing a quick swipe. \" Oy !\" came a startled yell. The man had turned to see the dog up at the table, going for their meal. He ran over, shouting and waving his wife's hat. Unable to get hold of the steak quickly enough, Rita made a hasty retreat, furious that she'd missed her chance. It had really been one of those days; a whole lot of near misses and nothing to show for her efforts. She hated to give up when the others had trusted her to find them something to eat, and walked off, trying to stay positive. Rita took the responsibility of bringing food home very seriously- certainly more than some of her companions seemed to, and did not want to face the shame of failing in her mission. She knew that no one else would mind all that much, it had been a tough few days after all, but it mattered to her . Rita had her pride after all. For several more hours Rita searched without luck, and she became more and more frustrated, but as the sky was starting to darken, something finally caught her eye. A pizza delivery car was parked outside a house, the delivery man had- unwisely, left the door open as he'd gone up to the house with the family's pizzas. As quietly and quickly as possible, Rita went over to investigate. As the delivery man chatted at the doorway oblivious, Rita slipped into the car, and whilst carefully keeping out of sight, discovered an as yet undelivered pizza. She carefully picked the box up in her teeth and manoeuvred herself out of the car. The pizza deliverer turned around as he heard her get out, but by the time he ran over it was already too late. Even encumbered with a box of pizza, she was fast and agile. The man swore angrily. It wasn't all that easy to run through the city with a large, awkward box to carry, but Rita was relieved and happy, and didn't mind one bit. Jumping between cars was all but impossible with such a cumbersome object in her jaws, so she resigned herself to taking the slower means of travel; walking through the streets and alleys. By this time it was quite late, and as she came out into the open air near the docks the cold was biting and the howling wind tugged at her fur. She wanted to get home, to rest after a long day. As her anticipation for the relative comfort of home grew, Rita felt an unnerving feeling that someone was watching her. She looked around, half expecting to have to fight to keep her prize, to see Dodger walking over from behind. \"Not just a pretty face, huh, Rita?\" he said, eyeing the box that Rita held in her mouth. Even from the distance he could smell it; and was made all the more ravenous. Rita dropped her prize to the ground and wagged her tail in greeting. \"But of course you already knew that.\" she replied, smiling at him. There was no one she'd rather have sneak up behind her than her closest friend. \"I take it you're out late after a busy day of flirting with every woman in the city?\" \"Nah, what do ya take me for?\" Dodger laughed, as Rita raised an eyebrow at him. \"I've been 'round to see the kid. There's been a bit of drama over there, so who better to help?\" \"Is Oliver all right?\" Rita asked, concerned. In the months since they met the little cat, Oliver had never been far from Dodger's thoughts, and the mutt spent as much time with him as possible, despite how far removed their respective lives were. The bond between the two of them may have formed quickly, but it was strong. As much as he hated to talk about it, letting Oliver go had been a great wrench for Dodger and a part of him was still struggling to get over it. Rita had worried a lot about Dodger in the early days, but he seemed to be doing better. \"He's fine, there's just been a lot happenin'. You can come over with me tomorrow if you want, put your mind at rest. But don't worry about it, everything's fine.\" Rita studied his face carefully; she knew that even if Dodger was worried about something that he'd do his best to make certain it was well hidden. Satisfied that Dodger was genuinely unconcerned, she picked up the box again and continued on her way, now walking alongside her friend. \"Ya know,\" Dodger said with a slight grin and a sudden gleam in his eyes, \"We could sit down somewhere together and have a little bite to eat, just the two of us.\" Rita sighed, and put the box back down to respond. \"Dodge, we've got to get back. I don't think it would go down well if we ate all the food.\" \"I dunno, I think some pizza would go down pretty well...\" \"You know what I meant.\" She went to pick up the box, but found herself looking back to Dodger first. \"How about tomorrow night?\" she asked, feeling hopeful. Trust Dodger to choose an inappropriate time to make a move on her. \"If you're not doing anything.\" \"Absitively yes, baby.\" Dodger replied with a characteristically cocky grin. Dodger took a turn at carrying the box to give Rita a break, as it wasn't the easiest thing to hold comfortably in one's mouth. The two continued on their way, imagining that the others must surely be hungry, and wondering what was taking such a long time. Tired from battling the wind and with damp fur from a fall of rain, Dodger and Rita finally arrived back at the old barge with dinner. Einstein, Tito and Francis had retreated to the shelter of the rickety boat a long time ago and had been waiting impatiently for their companions, and -more importantly- food. They met the newcomers with great enthusiasm and wide eyes. \"Woah, pizza! Nice job, Dodger man!\" Tito bounced over, delighted to see that they had something substantial to eat; it had been a few days since the last time. Einstein was chasing his tail in wild excitement, all the time chanting, \"Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!\" \"Actually, dinner's brought to you today by my lovely assistant, Rita. I just helped carry it home.\" Dodger told them, thinking he probably shouldn't take all the credit this time. If he were to give a dramatic tale of his success every day, his stories would lose their impact. The others looked slightly surprised and thanked Rita, or at least grunted out sounds that sounded somewhat like 'thank you'- they did after all have rather full mouths. No one was very much bothered by the question of who brought home the grub, they just cared that someone did. \"Make sure you leave some for Fagin.\" Rita said, noticing that they were going through it all very quickly. Fagin didn't snack through the day in the same way the dogs did, so it was important that they kept him properly fed; besides, the kind-hearted man would use his scant funds to buy dog biscuits before he'd feed himself. Making sure to leave a sizeable helping for her master, Rita pulled off a piece for herself and sat beside Dodger. The pizza was cold, but still tasty. What was even better was to see everyone else enjoying it and knowing she'd done well. Tomorrow, the food run would be a burden on someone else's shoulders, and she could spend her afternoon tucked up in bed. Over their much-welcomed meal, the gang happily chattered about the events of the day. Rita couldn't help but that Dodger failed to mention that he'd visited Oliver, and she found this curious; usually spending time with the cat was something that would be brought up, after all, everyone was always excited to hear how he was going. She decided not to think too much of it, and instead listened to Tito telling them about how he'd almost been swept away in the strong winds. \"That's a pity, maybe next time...\" said Francis. \"Watcha mean Frankie?\" Tito exclaimed angrily. \"I think you know what I mean, Tito.\" \"No chance of you ever blowing away though, huh Frankie!\" Francis puffed himself up, furious, \"It's Francis, you insignificant and minuscule excuse for a canid!\" \"Guys, cut it out, some of us are trying to eat!\" Rita snapped. Man, those two could be annoying. Francis was in even more of a huff when he realised that Einstein had polished off his piece for him while he'd been preoccupied with his argument with Tito. However, the bulldog's petty woes were soon forgotten when Fagin came in through the door, sopping wet, but happy as always to see his canine friends. All five dogs leapt up to greet their master and give him a thorough licking. Fagin was thrilled to see the food that had been brought in, and tucked in as he offered dog biscuits to his canine friends. It seemed a fair exchange. Although things had obviously improved since Sykes' demise, Fagin was kept busy trying to provide for his furry family as much as possible, especially knowing that with winter on the way, life would soon be getting much tougher. He was optimistic though, much more so than he had been when Sykes was looming over him. As the boys gathered around Fagin to listen to a story- a 'new' one which an ecstatic Einstein had found a few days ago, Rita retired to her bed. As the nights were starting to get chilly, she had added a ragged blanket in there for a bit of extra comfort and warmth. She enjoyed having her own space to get away to where she had a little bit of privacy, and her bed was just right. With one blanket for her to lie on and one draped over her back, it was cosy. The curtain that hung around her head blocked any wind or rain that came through the hole in the roof. She'd slept there ever since she was a pup, and it was her home within a home, the place where she was most comfortable. Her eyelids drooped as she listened to the story, only half paying attention. She found herself thinking more about what Dodger had said, and what he hadn't said. What was it that was going on with Oliver? If nothing was wrong, why hadn't told the rest of the gang? Rita found Dodger extremely frustrating at times; he was never one to give away any more than he wanted to. While Rita understood and saw through Dodger better than most, even she often struggled to read him a lot of the time. She was looking forward to spending time with him the next day; it had been a while since the two of them had spent quality time together alone. In the time they had known each other, Rita had come to love Dodger deeply as a friend or even more- though she had no intention of admitting to the latter, it wouldn't be worth the risk of damaging their friendship. She was at her happiest by his side, and the thought of being with him warmed her more than any blanket ever could. Having Dodger beside her and to herself for an evening would surely keep her spirits running high. As Fagin finished the chapter, Dodger headed to bed. Tito and Einstein had fallen asleep on Fagin's lap and Francis at his feet. Rita smiled as she looked over to see the others had settled down for the night, and then curled up herself. It all seemed pretty peaceful. Nightmares of Roscoe and DeSoto had haunted them all in the past months, all except for Dodger; if he did suffer from frightening dreams he never showed it. Rita had often been disturbed by the tossing and turning of her companions as they slept, and had her fair share of nightmares herself. Now, everyone was settled, apparently at ease with the world and recovered from what had been a terrible scare, even if it had been something of an exciting adventure. There was no doubt that the coming months would be tough, but the worst of their troubles were behind them, and the future they could take on together. With a glance over to Dodger, who caught her eye with his usual self-satisfied smirk, Rita lay down her head and drifted off into a peaceful sleep.[Chapter 2] To the relief of everyone, the weather a lot calmer when Fagin and his dogs headed out the next day. It was still rather chilly, but at least Tito would not have to worry about being swept away in a gust of wind. Rita was hopeful that she'd finally find out from Dodger what was going on at the Foxworths', and even better, she'd be able to see Oliver again, for it had been a fair while since she'd last paid him a visit. The thought of spending an afternoon in their lovely warm house was admittedly an inviting one too. While the others went off in different directions to search the city for food and treasures, Rita kept close to Dodger, making sure he didn't slip away as he so frequently did. On this occasion, though, he was enjoying having an accomplice. As the two most successful pick-pockets in the gang, Dodger and Rita made an effective team and soon managed to score a couple of wallets between them. As always, Dodger was more than happy to show off for Rita's benefit and made sure she watched his every slick move. After hiding their loot in a safe spot to collect later, the two dogs headed off to the Foxworths', making their way through the crowded streets and using the tops of cars to get around on. They approached the side of the house where Jenny's room was situated and barked until Oliver appeared at the window. It was much easier to get him to let them in when they wanted to visit rather than sneak in as they'd done the first time they came to the grand house. Even from down below Rita could tell that the cat had grown up considerably since she'd last seen him. Since the incident with Sykes she'd only seen him twice, though Dodger had visited far more frequently. They waited for Oliver to reappear downstairs and open the window to the sitting room (the latch was rather stiff with all the cold weather and Oliver had to work to make it budge). Rita thought it a shame that she hadn't been around with Dodger more, she cared a lot for Oliver and was keen to see how he was doing. Preoccupied though she was in collecting for Fagin, the little kid was still important to her. \"Come on in, guys,\" Oliver said, puffing as he finally opened the window. He grinned broadly at his friends. As Rita climbed in after Dodger, she noticed a small, apparently feline figure dart behind a bookcase and out of sight. Before Rita could look to see whom or what the little creature was, she found herself being met enthusiastically by Oliver, who rubbed himself against her legs in greeting. He had indeed grown considerably, becoming quite chunky and his features were rather more adult, though he still had a look of kitten about him. \"It's good to see you kid, how are you?\" she asked, giving him a friendly nuzzle. She hesitated slightly. \"Who's your friend?\" \"She's what's been goin' on around here- some of it anyway.\" Dodger replied on Oliver's behalf. Oliver looked over his shoulder to the place where the other cat had disappeared to. She came out again, briefly peering at the visitors, and then scurried out of the door. \"Her name's Evie, she's been here a few weeks now. Jenny's dad found her on his way home from work one day, she was awfully thin and sick.\" \"Not too keen on strangers, huh?\" Rita asked. \"Just dogs, she doesn't like dogs at all. It's kind of a problem with Georgette around.\" Oliver explained, \"Evie says that she had some bad experiences with dogs when she was out on the streets, and now she's just scared.\" Dodger added for Rita's benefit, \"She got unlucky and fell in with the wrong crowd; it sounds like she's been crossin' Flint an' his gang.\" \"Oh.\" Rita sighed. Realising this could be trouble, she moved her gaze from the doorway from which Evie had left the room to give Dodger a worried look. \"She's all right,\" Dodger shrugged, unconcerned. \"She's not gonna come to any trouble while she's here, and I don't reckon she'll be going anywhere after what she's been through.\" \"I want to help her not be so scared of dogs, I mean, Georgette's not always the nicest person in the world, but she's not going to hurt her.\" Oliver said. \"I want Evie to feel at home here, and that means even with Georgette around.\" Dodger looked over to Rita. \"I thought we might be able to help out a bit, show the kid we're not all bad. I didn't mention it to anyone else 'cause I didn't imagine she'd appreciate five dogs all at once, including one about the size of a small horse.\" \"I'm happy to help if I can,\" Rita said, and then turned to Oliver. \"You're gonna want to take it slow though, if we rush her it might just make it worse. She looks in a pretty bad way.\" \"Yeah, she seems to be happier when no one's paying much attention to her,\" said Oliver, \"She met Dodger yesterday though, and that went pretty well I guess. Maybe you could come and meet her now, she won't have gone far.\" The two dogs followed Oliver, and found that the new cat was sitting in the hallway by herself. She was pale cream in colour, with blue grey points and silky fur. Her figure was slight, and she had the distinct appearance of someone who had not been eating well. She eyed the visitors suspiciously, particularly Rita, whom she'd never met. \"Hey Evie,\" Oliver greeted her, \"You remember Dodger from yesterday, right? And this is Rita,\" Oliver motioned toward the leggy hound who, though curious, was trying to avoid staring at the young cat as she didn't want her to feel threatened. \"She's a friend of mine too, completely safe.\" Evie stiffened, but didn't back away. 'Completely safe' was a bit a stretch for any dog as far as she was concerned. \"Pleased to meet you,\" she said nervously, looking up at Rita. Rita crouched slightly, making herself look smaller, and greeted the cat. \"It's good to meet you too,\" she said gently. \"If you're a friend of Oliver's, you're a friend of mine.\" Evie smiled shyly, but still couldn't relax. \"We're gonna go hang out downstairs, if you want to come and join us, you can.\" Oliver told her. He figured that giving Evie a bit of space would be the best move for the time being. Dodger and Rita followed Oliver down into the lounge, leaving Evie to come down if and when she felt brave enough, and settled on the large, comfortable couches. They figured it was best not to force anything onto Evie, and to make use of the opportunity to catch up. Oliver, as always, was thrilled to have his 'brother' around to hang out with, and had a great time play wrestling with Dodger. He did have a slight suspicion though that Dodger may have been letting him win a lot of the time, but it was all good fun. Rita stretched out on the couch, watching them. There was something special about seeing Dodger show his soft side around Oliver; it wasn't a part of him that he very often let anyone see. She smiled as she watched, and found herself thinking about just how good meeting Oliver had been for her friend. He looked so comfortable in this new role, and happy. It was hard not to imagine what might have been; the courageous little cat would have been a very welcome addition to the gang, where he might have been more of an influence on the hard-guy terrier. But, Rita supposed, things just turned out the way that was best- Oliver was happiest here, and that was what mattered most of all. She hoped that the bond he shared with Dodger could survive, even if they were apart… it was hard to imagine how much it would hurt the mutt if it wasn't to be. The trio were startled by a shrieking exclamation from the doorway; Georgette was horrified to walk in to find that she and Oliver had guests. \"Ugh... as if it's not bad enough that I've got to put up with a second 'cute little kitty', I can't even relax in my own lounge room without being bombarded by mutts who smell like they bathe in sewer water. Really Oliver, you could have warned me!\" she snapped angrily. \"So you've missed me then, Champ?\" Dodger smiled at her. \"You can relax Georgette; I wiped my paws on the way in.\" Rita laughed. Georgette was not impressed in the slightest and made to walk off in a huff. She stopped herself to quickly make certain of something of the utmost importance. \"When you came in, you weren't seen by anyone?\" she asked in a hushed, almost panicked tone. Rita shook her head, and Georgette hurried out of the room. \"Georgette's a bit sensitive right now with the new arrival and everything.\" Oliver explained, \"She doesn't want it to get out that we have anything to do with street dogs; apparently the damage it would do to her reputation would be 'the last straw'.\" Dodger laughed. \"We wouldn't dream of harming the champ's rep.\" \"Guess she'll just have to be extra nice to us to make sure.\" Rita grinned. \"Don't worry kid, we can do subtle,\" she winked at the young cat. \"Thanks guys, the last thing I want is to have Georgette in an even worse mood.\" Oliver stretched out on the couch and flopped down on to his stomach. \"So kid, what else has been going on here?\" Rita asked. \"Oh yeah, I forgot. We found out the other day that Jenny's mom is having a new baby. Jenny's excited, but she's also worried that her parents will have even less time for her when the baby comes along.\" Rita's eyes widened in surprise. \"A baby! That really is big news. Jenny's lucky to have you around, it's gotta be a big adjustment for her,\" she said to Oliver. \"Yeah, Jenny will always have me to look after her.\" Oliver said proudly. \"You're gonna have your paws full, kid, lookin' after all the women in the house.\" Dodger winked at Oliver. Rita suddenly realised just how late it was getting. \"Isn't Jenny going to be home soon?\" Oliver shook his head. \"Nope, they've all gone out to visit friends. I guess they want to share the good news. You can stay here as long as you like.\" With no real need to rush off home, Rita stretched out and made herself right at home. Why not make the most of the warm and comfortable lounge room while she could? Oliver and Dodger were soon sparring again, before the little cat made a dash over to the piano to show his friends the contributions he'd been making to Jenny's playing. Soon enough, the dogs were howling along and laughing. Peering around the door frame, Evie watched with great curiosity. Oliver was clearly not remotely fearful, in fact, he seemed to love the company of those scruffy dogs. Not feeling brave enough to move any closer to the action, she found herself smiling slightly nonetheless. Whatever Oliver was, he was nothing like any other cat she had ever known. By the time Dodger and Rita left the Foxworths' it was early evening and the air was becoming ever colder. Rita shivered slightly as she stepped outside, quickly wishing she was curled up back on the comfortable- and no doubt expensive- furniture indoors. Dodger sidled up to her, an excited gleam in his eye. \"You still up for hangin' out tonight?\" Rita had forgotten about Dodger's suggestion the night before, but was pleased that he hadn't. \"Sure. You're supplying dinner, right?\" she replied, looking over her shoulder as she started to walk away, back to the hiding place where they'd left the wallets they'd stolen earlier. Dodger caught up with Rita, and the two headed into the city, keeping an eye out for any opportunities to make a decent meal. Once they got moving the cool air was actually quite pleasant and gave the two energy to move around the city at high speed; skimming over the tops of cars with ease. It was fun; of all the gang, they were the two most adept at this unique method of locomotion, and once they got going, they almost seemed to fly through the city. Exhilarated, they egged one another on, and put on quite the show for passing pets out for late afternoon walks. The pet life was something neither Dodger nor Rita could imagine; they were free and proud, and that was the way they liked it. The pair scoured the alleyways, tipping over trash cans and digging through rubbish. It wasn't too long before Dodger came across something appetizing. \"So Rita, chicken sound good to you?\" he asked, pulling out a half-eaten cooked chicken. It was long since cold; no thanks to the chill in the air, but the scent was awfully inviting all the same. Rita licked her lips hungrily and rushed over to join Dodger. They found themselves a quiet spot, out of the way enough so that they wouldn't be disturbed, and started tucking in. As they enjoyed their meal, the two talked together, freely as they didn't often get the chance to. Usually there was at least one of the others around, which was fine, but at the same time it felt good to be one-on-one for a change. Both were relaxed and happy, able to laugh together and just take pleasure in one another's company. As they talked, Rita noticed that Dodger let his mask slip a little, not needing to put on a show as it was just the two of them. He became very natural around her, the usual smug tone fading as the barriers went down, and Rita loved it. It had always been a very rare occurrence for Dodger to show his softer side, but since meeting Oliver, that seemed to be gradually changing. He even talked to her about the kid; something that was a bit of a tender area. Dodger was gradually getting over the hurt of the perceived rejection, and admittedly it felt good to be able to share his feelings with Rita. She'd felt his loss to the gang as well, having very quickly developed maternal feelings towards Oliver, and seemed to understand how much Dodger missed him. With the cold chicken polished off, Dodger leapt up into a play bow, daring Rita to come and chase him. Unable to resist, Rita crouched, ready to jump at him. \"Come on, Rit. Think ya can handle The Dodge?\" he teased, and he ran off into the busy streets with Rita close behind. The two ran and played in the cold evening air, revelling in the sense of freedom and one another's company. As they came close to the docks, the two clashed and fell to the ground, growling playfully and grappling at each other with their teeth and claws. It was fast and furious, and an onlooker might easily have thought they'd stumbled onto a vicious dogfight, but it was all for show and play. Exhausted, Rita finally admitted defeat. \"Okay Dodgie-baby, you win this time,\" she panted, falling against him. Dodger moved in close to Rita, feeling the warmth of her breath as his muzzle gently brushed up against hers, their mouths almost touching. It felt nice… it felt wonderful. Realising that he'd gotten too caught up in the moment, he quickly moved back, feeling strangely awkward. Rita looked at him, curious, almost certain she'd just seen him look at her in a way that she'd never seen him do before. There was a softness there, different to the playful smarminess with which he usually eyed her, but somehow there was also a great intensity behind his gaze. Was it a look of deep affection- love even? But then, he'd hastily withdrawn, as if fearful of what was happening. It was almost as if he was holding back from something more, but Rita simply told herself that she'd imagined it. All the same, she felt her heartbeat quicken with some sort of pleasurable exhilaration. Dodger nudged his head against hers. He'd almost gone too far, and he knew that she'd picked up on it. However he felt about Rita, he couldn't just go blundering in without thinking; she was his friend, and he really wasn't a romantic commitment kind of guy. \"Come on,\" he said, \"we'd better get back.\" \"I've really enjoyed this, Dodge, thank you.\" Rita said, and then walked over to pick up the wallet that had been dropped a short way away on the ground when they'd started to rough-house. She walked close to Dodger as they continued home. \"No problem, we should do it again sometime,\" Dodger grinned and added, \"and then I can beat you all over again.\" \"I wouldn't bet on it!\" Rita scoffed, nipping his ear. \"You better watch out, mutt, because I one of these days I am really gonna kick your tail.\"[Chapter 3] \"This girl was hot, musta been some sorta pointer or setter- the set of legs on her were somethin' else. I tell ya, Rit, you would've been turned on!\" Rita rolled her eyes at Dodger. He'd been giving her a lot of this, and seemed to be failing to pick up on what she thought was a very obvious lack of interest. \"So I took her up behind the old tyre factory…\" Dodger continued. \"Dodgie-baby,\" Rita cut across, having heard quite enough. \"Honey, I know you're proud of yourself and all that, but I really don't need to hear the details of your love life- you can just leave it to my imagination. Whatever you've been doing, whoever you've been doing, I really don't want have any desire to hear about it. At all. You're obviously having a good time, and I'm happy for you, but just quit it, okay?\" Unperturbed, Dodger gave Rita a smug grin. He'd achieved what he'd wanted to, and could now dial back the stories. \"I didn't take ya for a prude, babe?\" \"I have my limits,\" Rita said curtly. \"Go find Tito, you know he'd be impressed.\" Dodger had spent a good deal of the days following busying himself with seeking out encounters with attractive women wherever he might find them, hoping to put out a strong message of his promiscuity. It was all for Rita's benefit. Dodger suspected that she'd sensed his coming close to kissing her, and subsequently he'd made it his mission to ensure she didn't think anything of it. He made a point of telling her of every woman he'd been with since then for good measure, though he'd have to take it down a notch now that she'd made it quite clear that she'd had enough of hearing sordid details of his love life. Dodger couldn't stop thinking about Rita- even while he romanced beautiful strangers, and found himself at a loss as to how to make sense of the feelings he had for her. He was attracted to her; always had been, and of course he deeply cared for her- they'd been friends since they were pups after all, but something had shifted in him and it had thrown him for a loop. It had been something that had been building up for weeks, a desire to be closer to her. He'd have to get a grip on himself else make a mess of a relationship that was perfectly fine the way it was. All the same, a nagging thought lingered… just how good it might be if they did take their friendship further. They were great together already, but could they be even better? Satisfied that he'd sent out a clear message to Rita of his intentions, or lack thereof, Dodger was content to slip back into happily hanging around by her side. She was smart enough to keep him on his toes, and it made their time together fun for him. \"All right, all right!\" Dodger said, giving himself a casual scratch behind the ear, \"I'm hearin' ya loud and clear. Work before pleasure an' all that. So you wanna get some work done before it gets too cold?\" \"That sounds a bright idea- those clouds don't give me a good feeling,\" Rita said, looking up to the skies, which were ominously grey. \"Better to get something done before it's pouring down.\" After gathering a few bits and bobs to take back to Fagin, they slipped away from the others to pay another visit to Oliver and his new friend. It was a horrible day, and both dogs were wet to the bone from the almost constant downpour of rain. Already the cold was biting, and Rita had a nasty feeling that this winter would be a tough one, but it was hard to worry too much when she had Dodger by her side. He made the hardships of life on the streets seem easy, and it was catching. They slid across the wet top of a bus, and Dodger laughed as Rita tossed the soaked fur from her face. \"Sure you can see, beautiful?\" the mutt shouted over the sound of the rain, the laugh still on his face. He jumped quickly out of the way as Rita kicked a puddle of water to splash him. Dodger found himself glancing over to watch Rita as she ran over the traffic. Even in a wet and slippery environment she moved with such grace, and she barely even looked where she was going, confident as she was in her own connection with the city's heartbeat. Dodger didn't know anyone else who could move quite like that- sometimes it almost took his breath away to watch her. Both dogs were panting happily when they set down on the pavement by the Foxworth house, and laughed as they shook water from their coats over one another. Dodger always timed his visits to the kid for the middle of the day, when Jenny would be at school and Winston would be running errands. The only person around to interfere would be Georgette, and Dodger was not particularly bothered by her protests. This time, the timid young Evie didn't run as the visitors arrived but sat, with a look of discomfort, waiting to greet them. She glanced nervously at Oliver as the window was opened, and found the fur on her shoulders raise in spite of all the reassurance her friend had given her. Friendly or not, Dodger and Rita were still dogs big enough that they could do her a lot of damage if they were to turn on her. Only a fool would not be wary. \"Hiya, kid,\" Dodger said with a wag of his tail. Smooth in his movements as always, he came on through the window went to Oliver's side, barely even offering Evie a glance- it wasn't her that he was interested in. The little orange cat's eagerness to see Dodger shone through in his eyes, and it was something that he never tired of. \"Just a quick visit today, we've still gotta bring back more food before the cold really sets in.\" \"That's fine. Just mind you don't drip everywhere, or Winston will go nuts,\" Oliver said, foreseeing the floor getting slippery with water droplets. \"Sorry, Ollie, we shook most of it out before coming in,\" Rita smiled gently, \"We'll try not to spread it all around,\" she turned to the other cat who was sitting as if ready to leap up and run from the room at any moment, \"You're looking well, Evie. Stayin' warm and dry, hon?\" Evie cowered under the hound's gaze, immediately feeling threatened. Her eyes pointedly on her own paws, she finally nodded stiffly and managed a small smile. \"Yes, thank you. I've been curled up by the fire all morning.\" His friend's words gave Oliver an idea, and he brought the dogs through to the sitting room so they could enjoy the heat of the fire and dry off a bit. They sat and talked for a while, though it soon became too much for young Evie and she left Oliver to it. Oliver looked after her, disappointed at the slow progress, but Dodger quickly brought his attention back with an ever so slightly embellished tale of a recent escapade. Soon though, Dodger and Rita had to return to work and the damp, dark afternoon. If the gang was to remain warm and fed, they'd have to keep moving. The days grew gradually colder, and Rita began to feel herself struggling. With so much energy being put into keeping warm, she began to lose weight, and suffered from almost constant hunger pains. She wasn't the only one either, poor old Einstein took a great deal of food to keep well, and in the harsh winter, there simply wasn't a great deal of food around. Rita was often left wishing she could do more for the friends that she loved, especially as Fagin was ill at the moment and in need of extra care. She took comfort in Dodger's reassurance that things would soon get better; it would not be long before the swarms of Christmas shoppers would reach their peak and the opportunities for stealing from overwhelmed and stressed folk would skyrocket. Despite the difficulties in getting by, Dodger still rarely gave any impression of getting down; even in tough times he seemed to sail through effortlessly. How much of it was a true indication of how he was feeling and how much was the show he put on was a mystery to everyone, though Rita suspected that he was hungrier than he let on. Dodger was happy to throw himself into work; he had a family depending on him and his job as the gang's leader was to get them all through the tough times. It was also a good distraction from any thoughts he might have otherwise dwelled on about his changing relationship with Rita. He had by now decided that his almost kissing her was simply down to having not been with a woman for a good few days. Nothing significant at all. The solution, therefore, was to keep himself busy in the romance department so there would be no need for his mind to wander Rita's way. It didn't quite explain why he still kept finding himself gazing at her, but for now it would be reasoning enough. While every day was a struggle, Rita looked forward to coming back home in the evenings, and would seek out Dodger's company whenever she could. Relieved that he'd stopped sharing with her stories of his womanising ways, Rita loved being around him, and they often talked together long into the night while everyone else slept. He understood her, better than anyone else ever had, and he had an uncanny ability to make her smile when life threatened to get on top of her. On this night, however, Dodger hadn't returned home. Rita lay in bed, shivering more than usual as she'd donated her usual blanket to a poorly Fagin. The wind was howling, and the boat rocked constantly, making the hound feel quite ill. Every now and then a great thunderclap would shake the barge, and a terrified Einstein would resume cowering. The old dog had always had a phobia of thunderstorms; in fact it was in his desperation to find an escape from a mighty storm that he first encountered Fagin all those years ago. For Einstein, his master was his security blanket, and it was Fagin whom he'd go to first when the weather became frightening. Rain coming through the ceiling meant that the floor was damp, and a smell of wet dog hung in the air. Rita barely noticed the wet, nor the intermittent whimperings of Einstein. Instead, she found herself thinking about Dodger's strange behaviour recently, all since that night out they'd enjoyed together. Something about the way he'd looked at her that night played on her mind, a tenderness he'd always been reluctant to show. Perhaps Dodger had noticed the shift in himself and that was the reason behind his exaggerated promiscuity… but then after a few days of that nonsense he had been seeking out Rita's company almost constantly. It was definitely odd. Maybe she was overthinking it, but Rita certainly felt like something was different between them. Whatever might be going on, there was no one she could really talk to about it; Rita had never bothered herself to make close friends outside of the gang as usually she had no need to. It was a tough world for a street dog, and Rita had many acquaintances who'd simply vanished, eventually presumed dead. Getting too emotionally involved with a lot of people when life was so hard would only bring more misery than it was worth, and Rita was quite content to limit her close relationships to the gang and a couple of her relatives. There was no bringing this one up with the guys though, the chance of their interference in the name of 'helping' was too great. The only other person she could go to was her litter sister, but Willow had always hated Dodger with a passion so could hardly be expected to give anything remotely close to useful advice. Rita tried to block it all from her mind so she could get some sleep, but only to be startled by Einstein flinging his substantial and shivering bulk at her. \"Wha-? Einstein!\" Rita exclaimed, taken by surprised and expecting that she'd be feeling a bruise the next day. \"Cool it, the thunder won't hurt you. It's just noise- I've told you that a hundred times!\" She sympathised with Einstein and his deep-seated fear, but it was late and she was exhausted. The Great Dane shook with fear and cold, and his ears drooped miserably. \"I'm sorry, Rita, I can't help it. The noise makes me feel all wrong inside, like something bad's going to happen,\" Einstein whimpered. \"I don't want to bug Fagin too much, 'cause he's sick.\" Rita softened a little, realising that being over-tired had led her to being unnecessarily harsh. Einstein couldn't help it, and she knew that. \"You don't have to be sorry, Einy,\" she said, more gently. \"If it makes you feel better, you can lie with me.\" It wasn't terribly comfortable for Rita to have a dog of Einstein's size almost climbing right on top of her every time a rumble of thunder shook the barge, but still she patiently allowed him to fall asleep pressed tightly against her. The was no room for Einstein in Rita's poor-dog's canopy bed, so he lay alongside, partially draped over her forequarters. Eventually, the thunder subsided, leaving only the sounds of rain and howling winds. Feeling safe and secure, Einstein drifted off to sleep. The noise of the storm gradually became less fierce, and Dodger finally made an appearance. He'd taken shelter nearby throughout the worst of the wild weather, and had seen an opportunity to return home. His wiry fur was soaked, and his red bandanna was completely sodden. Dodger shook himself as he came down onto the floor, making sure not to splash water onto his companions. \"Ah,\" said Francis, \"and so our fine leader emerges from the deluge! I was just beginning to grow concerned.\" \"Yeah, where ya been, man?\" Tito piped up, poking his head up over Francis' side. \"I thought you got washed away!\" Dodger smirked. \"Nah! Who's dumb enough to go runnin' around in a storm like that? Thought you guys would be fine without me, so I lay low for a while,\" he said. \"Einstein okay?\" he asked, noticing that the usually clingy dog had left his master to sleep in peace. \"He's fine, Dodge,\" Rita said, lifting her head. \"He kicked up the usual fuss, but he's sleeping now.\" She gave a wide yawn, exposing her sharp teeth. \"Probably got the right idea; I'm beat.\" It had been a hard and tiring day, and Dodger too was more than ready to catch some shut-eye. He settled down in his bed, having positioned his umbrella so that he was well covered in case a new leak started in the roof while he slept. After being on his paws all day, settling down into his squashy bed felt simply wonderful. It wasn't a lot that they had, but it was still a cosier home than most street dogs had. Rita closed her eyes, listening to the steady fall of rain and the sounds of her friends getting comfortable for the night. Even after a little while, Dodger was still tossing and turning. \"Can't sleep, Dodgie-baby?\" Rita cooed. \"Just thinking, that's all. Fagin's pretty rough right now, we need to switch our focus to bringin' food home, and nothing else,\" Dodger spoke with his voice muffled by a cushion. \"Makes sense, he's not really up to going out to pawn stuff off.\" Rita yawned. It really dampened everyone's spirits when Fagin was unwell, and the steady fall of rain falling through the holes in the roof did nothing to lift the mood. \"Poor old fellow,\" Francis murmured sleepily, careful not to dislodge Tito from his cosy position wrapped in his loose jowl, \"if we can at least keep him warm, surely he will soon be on the mend.\" \"I hope so,\" Rita sighed. Einstein had rolled away from her a little, so she curled up, trying to hold onto her body heat. No matter what she did, though, found herself violently shivering all the same. Slowly, most of the gang drifted off to sleep, but Rita lay there for several more hours, unable to relax as she simply couldn't get herself comfortable. Even Einstein, panicked though he was, finally began snoring- probably exhausted from his frantic pacing round and round the barge. Rita, meanwhile, still couldn't get Dodger out of her mind… how wonderful it must feel to snuggle up beside him, his body pressed up against hers, to have him kiss her goodnight. At least she was free to imagine, and as long as she kept it to herself no one could trample over her hopes and fantasies. Though she'd never allowed herself to examine the idea too closely- it wasn't as if anything would ever happen anyway- Rita wondered what it might be like to intimate with Dodger, not just the friend she'd always been to him. In all honesty, it would surprise her if he was to ever take anyone to be his mate, such commitment just wasn't his style. She herself hadn't actually ever had a great desire to have a long-term committed mate, but she'd always seen Dodger differently. Rita had always credited him with showing her the way to a life worth living, and knew it was very likely that had she not met him, she would never have survived puppyhood. Dodger had seen Rita at her lowest and helped her through, and likewise she'd stood by him in his own darkest hour. The harsh life faced by a dog in the big city led to these unbreakable bonds forged in times of adversity. At least, Rita thought, the two of them shared the strongest of friendships, and that was worth far more than anything else. Rita curled up tighter, her own body the only thing she had to block out the chill. It was to be a long, cold and miserable night, but it was something she'd have to get used to- winter was only just beginning.[Chapter 4] As they reached mid-December, neither Dodger nor Rita managed to find the time to visit Oliver and his new friend. The wintery weather was really starting to take hold, and finding enough food to keep everyone sustained was becoming more and more of a struggle. Dodger's infectious energy helped keep Rita going strong and remaining positive, but it was getting ever harder. The pressure was on, and bickering flared up within the gang at the drop of a hat as stress put everyone on edge. For the most part, the gang split up to work individually or in pairs when the conditions were bad, and on this occasion Rita had teamed up with Einstein to find a meal. As Einstein was ageing, he often felt quite stiff in the cold air, but was almost always cheerful despite this, and made a very pleasant companion. Of all the gang, he was the least disposed to picking fights when times were tough, and he always threw himself whole-heartedly into helping Fagin. Einstein had never been the most accomplished of pickpockets; he wasn't really built for such precise work that required a great deal of stealth. Though he sometimes came as a hindrance to her own stealthy operations, Rita was always glad to have the lumbering Great Dane by her side. While Rita was occupied by the delicate operation of thieving from unsuspecting passers-by, in this case a group of disorientated tourists, Einstein snuffled around in the background, going through trashcans and trying to remain relatively inconspicuous. Remaining inconspicuous was not a strong point of Einstein's, but he made a valiant, if futile, effort all the same. As Einstein searched, his attention was caught by the appearance of a cat a short distance away. His eyes lit up as he recognised the familiar figure, who was wandering around in a disoriented manner. \"Oliver?\" Einstein barked, causing the cat to jump in surprise. Hearing her friend's exclamation, Rita spun around, and was stunned to see Oliver bounding over. \"What are you doing out here, kid?\" she asked, eyes wide. He was a pet, and had no real business facing the bustling city alone- he lacked the necessary street smarts. Einstein gleefully bounded over to Oliver and invited him to jump up onto his back. \"Oh, I've just come out for a wander while Jenny's at school,\" Oliver replied, grinning as he sat on Einstein's shoulders. Looking at his two friends, he was startled to see how thin they were both looking, and had to stop himself from staring. \"I've made sure I remember the way home though.\" Rita relaxed a little, though remained uneasy, \"You've been doing this a lot?\" \"Yeah, every now and then. I've not got lost yet!\" Rita sighed with a reluctant smile; clearly Dodger's recklessness was rubbing off on his 'little brother'. If Oliver was going to act like some part-time street cat, then perhaps they'd better find the time to bring him up to speed with the skills he'd need to get by… it would have been so much easier if he'd stayed on with the gang! Rita felt the urge to ask Oliver how Evie was, but figured it was probably best not to bring her up while Einstein was around, lest the large and lovable goofball decide to pay her an unwelcome visit. Einstein was thrilled to see the young cat, who was rather heavier to carry on his back than when they'd last attempted it. Still, it was easy enough for a dog as large as he, and he had no hesitation in taking up his role as provider of piggy-back rides. \"You want a lift home, kid?\" he asked, already setting off at a jaunty trot, the question was clearly rhetorical. \"Einy! It's this way!\" Rita called, giving her head a shake towards the direction of the Foxworth home. She felt something cold on her muzzle, and looked up to see first snowflakes of the season begin to fall. Oliver stared upwards in wonderment and opened his mouth to catch the flakes on his tongue. He was almost dislodged from his perch atop Einstein's shoulders as the dog flung his head back enthusiastically to follow Oliver's lead. Seeing Oliver so happy and full of curiosity for the world around him brought a smile to Rita's face, and she watched as he and Einstein enjoyed the snowfall for a few moments, before moving on with a shiver. \"Hey, we'd better get movin', I'm freezing my tail off here.\" The three of them approached the Foxworths' grand residence, and Oliver found himself feeling uneasy, wondering how he was going to prevent Evie from getting the fright of her life when the enormous Einstein bounced into her home. \"You want to go in ahead and make sure all's clear?\" Rita asked, sensing Oliver's apprehension. Einstein crouched slightly so that Oliver could dismount- it was an awfully long way down, and the cat bounded into the house through the recently installed cat flap. He was very relieved to have the opportunity to give Evie a warning before having her personal space bombarded, and appreciated Rita's quick thinking and consideration. Oliver found Evie stretched out on the sofa, watching the snowfall through the window. \"You might want to find a quiet place to hide out for a little while, I've brought a couple of friends home.\" Evie felt rather alarmed… this sounded like Oliver had strangers with him. She wrinkled her nose slightly in displeasure. \"Rita's here, you know her- but Einstein's with her, and he's maybe a little bit too big for your liking.\" Oliver explained. \"Bigger than Rita?\" Evie asked, horrified. She'd met big dogs before, and the encounters had not been remotely happy ones. \"Yeah, just a lot. Why don't you hang out in the kitchen for a bit? You can have a bite to eat while we're in Jenny's room.\" Evie nodded and hurried off, making a bee-line for the highest, most inconspicuous hiding place that she could possibly find. Oliver let the two dogs in through the front door, and they were instantly hit by a wonderful warmth that filled the Foxworth household. It was quite a shock, albeit a nice one, to be somewhere so well-heated and comfortable. Oliver excitedly showed Einstein his new scratching post, complete with hanging toys for the ultimate in feline amusement. Rita lay down on Jenny's bed and happily watched the two of them. Feeling so cosy after many nights of difficult sleep due to the constant bitter cold, she relaxed completely. Very soon, she could no longer keep her eyes open. Several hours passed before Rita woke; as she lifted her head and realized where she was she felt very embarrassed. She looked around the room, bleary eyed, and saw that Oliver and Einstein had gone elsewhere. She stretched out, yawning, and slowly got up. Tentatively, she crept out of Jenny's room, not knowing if she might run into Winston, who was never really all that keen on having a load of dirty dogs in the house he spends so many hours keeping immaculate. Rita passed young Evie in the hallway, who happily greeted her, but kept looking cautiously behind the hound to make sure that the apparently massive stranger wasn't nearby. Rita was impressed by how well the little cat was coming along, it seemed that Oliver was really getting somewhere with her. As it turned out, Winston had gone out a short while ago to shop for groceries, and in his absence, Einstein and Oliver were enjoying the full run of the house. Rita joined them, but glanced to a grand clock in the corner of the room, and realised that it was getting late; most of the afternoon was gone. She was furious with herself for dropping off to sleep in the middle of the day; they were now running out of daylight hours to collect food, and she felt terrible knowing that the others were out there working. \"I'm sorry, kid, we'd really better be going,\" she told Oliver, trying not to come across as rude. Oliver frowned slightly. He wanted to help his friends out, and he felt a little guilty when he looked over to the pantry which was overflowing with food. When was the last time they'd really eaten well? \"You want to take something to eat before you go?\" he asked, visibly aware of the poor physical condition of his two friends. To his eye, they both looked to be little more than skin and bone. Einstein's eyes lit up at the sound of the word 'eat', and he bounded into the kitchen expectantly, with a look back over his shoulder ready to receive the okay from Rita. Rita, in contrast, felt extremely uncomfortable. She appreciated the offer, and admired the kid's good nature, but couldn't help feeling uneasy about taking from the Foxworths- surely Oliver would take the blame if things went missing. At the same time, she was painfully aware of the great hunger that had been troubling her for several days, and knew that the gang needed every morsel they could find just to keep going. After wasting precious hours that afternoon, it was very difficult to turn down an offer of such an easy meal, let alone deny Einstein a chance to wet his enormous appetite. She frowned. \"Thanks Oliver, but we can't take your food. Your family's already been so good to us, we can't abuse that now.\" Rita wondered if it was her own pride that was getting in the way. She hated that the young cat had sensed that they were growing weak and hungry. Einstein's smile and tail drooped; he felt like Christmas had been cancelled. Oliver pulled a face, a little offended. \"Are you sure you don't want to just take a bite to eat from my bowl? I really don't mind.\" Rita looked over to Einstein, knowing that she couldn't in good conscious say 'no' any longer. \"All right Einy, go ahead. But we really have to get going soon.\" Einstein followed Oliver jauntily into the kitchen. As they emerged again, they heard the squeaking of the front door opening, and the sound of voices. Jenny was overjoyed to see Einstein and Rita as she came in through the house. Winston 'hmmphed' and wondered how the dogs were managing to get into the unattended house- it was a complete mystery to him. Rita offered Jenny a friendly lick and a tail wag, but quickly motioned to Einstein for them to leave. As Jenny hugged Einstein goodbye, she noticed how easily she could feel his ribs under his coat, but before she had a chance to mention it, the dogs were off out the front door. The chill in the air hit the dogs as they stepped outside. Feeling guilty that they were now running out of time to find something substantial to eat, Rita sighed, and led Einstein out into the city. Rita and Einstein arrived back at the barge a few hours later with nothing to show for their efforts. While they'd managed to scrounge a few small nibbles here and there, they didn't find substantial enough to be worth bringing home. Ashamed of her failure, Rita avoided eye contact with Dodger as she retired to her bed. Once he'd gotten over his brief illness, Fagin had made efforts to keep the barge warm and dry, using tarpaulins to cover up leaks and gaping holes in the roof. It was a vast improvement, it had been getting almost impossible to sleep when water was forever coming in. Although far from perfect, the relative comfort of the barge was now very pleasant to come home to. \"Ah man, you too?\" Tito scowled. It hadn't been a very successful day all round. Neither he, nor Francis had brought anything back to the barge to eat, and Dodger had brought back only a bread roll, which by now had mostly been eaten. Rita emerged from her bed several minutes later, unable to settle. \"No luck then, Rit?\" Dodger asked. \"What does it look like?\" she snapped, fur bristling defensively. \"Ya know, not everyone can be 'The Dodge'. Just leave it, will you?\" Dodger recoiled, surprised by her hostility. He stared at her for a moment, but then turned back to the others, who were watching curiously. It wasn't often that Rita responded in such a brusque manner towards Dodger. The dogs' attention was diverted as Fagin walked through the door, carrying a small box of dog biscuits. Immediately, the atmosphere changed, as all five were clamouring to greet him. Fagin laughed as he was bowled over by his enthusiastic canine friends. Dodger dropped the remainder of the bread roll beside Fagin, who took it appreciatively and scratched Dodger behind the ears. Despite her frustration, Rita felt that bit cheerier as she greeted Fagin with licks, and bounded around him in excitement. She knew that their master would not begrudge the fact that they were going through a rough patch. The six of them settled in for another long night. Einstein excitedly told Francis, Tito and Dodger about their visit to the Foxworths', but to Rita's relief didn't go into too much detail. As the conversation slowed, Tito ran to fetch a bedtime story and made to drag it to Fagin, which was not a simple task for a dog of such small stature. Einstein picked Tito up by his tail, and dropped both the Chihuahua and the picture book in Fagin's lap. Rita made to move back to her bed, and Dodger caught her eye, watching her with a look of concern. She looked down, embarrassed. \"Look, Dodge,\" she said quietly, \"I'm sorry I took your head off earlier. I'm just a little stressed and tired and just... I'm sorry, really.\" She looked him in the face, her cheeks feeling hot. \"Hey, don't worry about it.\" Dodger grinned. He looked her over, aware that she was becoming ever thinner. As she disappeared through the curtains of her bed, he called quietly after her. \"Ya know, Rit, if you've been feelin' the cold, maybe you could do with an extra body in there.\" \"Don't expect it to be as comfy as yours.\" Rita managed a small smile, and moved slightly to one side, inviting Dodger to squeeze in next to her. Though she usually preferred her own space, she welcomed the extra warmth that Dodger lying beside her would bring, and though she wouldn't admit to it, it felt wonderful to have him near. Dodger moved in close, and lay down with his head resting on her neck. Rita exhaled in contentment and snuggled into him, his rough fur surprisingly nice to touch, and found herself feeling self-conscious. She had no doubt that he could feel her lack of condition, but the warmth and company would be worth any embarrassment. Feeling her body pressed up against his, Dodger could tell in an instant that Rita had lost a lot of weight, her ribs obvious beneath her fur. She'd not said a thing, always too proud let him know when she was struggling. Really, there wasn't a lot he could do to help anyway except to make sure she was warm at night and try harder to bring back enough food. Dodger glanced around; it had been a long time since he'd shared Rita's bed. No one else had ever been allowed in there; Rita hated anyone invading her space, but every now and then she'd make the exception for Dodger. As he lay with her, eyelids drooping, he felt the same confusion over his feelings for Rita that had only been growing stronger. The pair of them had always been close, ever since they were pups, and they had long shared a mutual attraction- playful, but an attraction nonetheless. She'd caught Dodger's eye when he was only little, but it had, of course, come to nothing, and they had simply grown up as good friends. Rita quickly became his most trusted confidant. Dodger knew that things had been different between them recently; he'd realised it had been since the run in with Sykes, and the arrival of Oliver into their lives. Dodger had been allowing himself to show his softer side just that little bit more, and it had been Rita who'd been seeing that part of him continue to grow. As he opened up to her further, the closer they continued to become, and despite all his attempts to distract himself, he could barely hold back his feelings. Somehow she managed to simultaneously be one of the toughest people he knew, and also one of the kindest and most compassionate; she could go from sweet to hard as nails in a second, she was cunning and street smart- and beautiful. Dodger was beginning to realise that he was in love with Rita; and the thought of it terrified him. He was a proud ladies' man, a womaniser, never one to get too serious or settle down, and he liked it that way. Though he'd never let on to anyone, the thought of allowing himself into a position where he was so intimate with someone, and therefore vulnerable, made him nervous, and he wondered if he'd really ever be able to trust even Rita to that extent. Rita stirred a little, rolling onto her side despite the lack of room. She looked to Dodger with half-closed eyes and smiled, unable to disguise her pleasure at having him close. She rested her head beside his, and was soon fast asleep, enjoying the warmth and comfort that her best friend provided. \"G'dnight, Rita.\" Dodger whispered. This felt nice, and she seemed every bit as happy that they were together as he was. He was vaguely aware that the others had been silently watching the two of them, but ignored this and allowed himself to relax, enjoying the soothing feeling of Rita's chest rising and falling beside him.[Chapter 5] The next day felt different, and Rita was feeling better and more refreshed than she had done for several weeks. While there was still a chill in the air, the sun was shining onto the newly fallen, bright white snow. For the first time since winter began, Rita found herself bounding around playfully in the fresh snow, quickly enticing Einstein into a happy frolic. On a day as beautiful as this, Dodger had decided to keep everyone together to work as a team rather than splitting up. It was a welcome change, and the whole gang seemed to be in high spirits. The fact that Dodger and Rita had spent the previous night in the same bed was of great interest to their companions, and Tito in particular was quick to tease. \"Dodger man, you sure that you weren't getting up to nothing? You two looked pretty cosy from where I was standing!\" Tito quipped, trotting alongside Dodger with a wicked gleam in his eye. \"Ya know, Tito, if we're measuring relationship status by time spent sleeping together, you and Francis would be married with twenty-eight pups!\" Dodger retorted, rolling his eyes. \"Hey man, that's different! Frankie's like an inflatable air mattress, all big and squashy. He is the bed,\" Tito laughed. Francis was affronted, and took a swipe with his paw at the Chihuahua, who bounced effortlessly out of the way. \"You can't tell me that bag of bones is comfortable!\" Tito added, glancing over to Rita. This was clearly a mistake, and he wasn't quick enough to avoid being swatted over the head and knocked off his paws. \"Tito, cool it, will ya? We've got some Christmas shoppin' to do.\" Dodger was keen to get down to business, if nothing else to get Tito to shut up. He was having enough trouble getting his head around his own feelings without everyone making such a big deal out of what might be nothing at all. Rita grinned in anticipation. Taking advantage of Christmas shoppers with more than they could carry was always good fun, and the thought of bringing Fagin home some serious loot after a relatively dry spell was exciting. She looked to Dodger for instruction, although she already knew to a large extent what would take place… she could do this in her sleep. After the previous day's abject failure, Rita was ready to prove that she was still at the top of her game. Granted, the hunger was a pretty good motivation as well. \"All right; Francis, get a crowd goin', you can think up a distraction, right?\" Dodger instructed. \"Tito, I know you're not classically trained or nothin', but you're gonna have to work with Francis on this one.\" Francis was pleased to have a chance to perform, and went over his techniques in his head. Tito wasn't thrilled with the idea of being the bulldog's assistant, but was eager enough to get some work done that he made his feelings clear with just a small scowl. Being too small to knock over shoppers, he'd just have to play a less exciting part in the operation. Dodger continued. \"Einstein, search out people with too much to carry, knock 'em off balance and grab what you can. Got it?\" Einstein nodded, his tongue lolling out in excitement. A dog as big as he would have little trouble in 'innocently' sending shoppers tumbling. \"Rita, you're with me.\" Dodger jerked his head slightly, signalling for her to follow him. The two of them found a spot out of sight, and watched as the others got to work, waiting for a good moment to rifle through the pockets and purses of distracted shoppers or to take off with bags of newly bought gifts. While Einstein was too large to do anything in a stealthy manner, knocking people over and making off with dropped goods was where he could shine, as there was little need for subtlety. His job was made easier by the fact that his victims were caught off guard- having been focussed on Francis, who was putting on a most impressive melodramatic performance in the middle of the street as Tito egged him on. Dodger and Rita took the opportunity to move silently through the crowds, working stealthily as they went. Rita mentally congratulated herself as she managed to pull a small purse, and then a newly bought Christmas sweater, from unsuspecting onlookers. The trouble was to get the loot safely out of the way- not easy when there was so much to carry. As Dodger realised that they were getting to the point where they had more than they could carry, he called out to the others, who moved swiftly out of the way of the crowds that milled around all around them. Struggling slightly to keep hold of her earnings as she raced after Dodger, Rita followed him for a few minutes until they found a quiet place to reconvene. She dropped the loot at his feet, alongside the small box containing a shining watch that Dodger had stolen. \"Not bad, Rit.\" Dodger said, inspecting the wallet and finding a crisp twenty dollar note inside, along with some coins. \"Not bad yourself.\" Rita responded, with a flirtatious half-smile. The others soon caught up, carrying Einstein's stolen goods- a shirt, a toy car and (to everyone's delight) a Christmas pudding, which was wrapped in cloth. Pleased with the morning's work, the gang headed back to the scooter to bring Fagin the fruits of their labour. They knew that their master would be over the moon with their efforts, and it was the first time in weeks that they wouldn't be ending the day with the feeling that they'd let him down. The impressive haul meant everyone was free to do as they wished for the afternoon, and for Rita, that meant staying close to Dodger. Since the previous night, Rita found she just couldn't get the tough guy mutt out of her head. She was surprised by the sudden intensity of her feelings for him; the attraction had been there a long time and usually she'd just ignored it. It was now getting increasingly difficult to pretend the feelings weren't there; her love for him was only growing stronger. There was no one else like Dodger; he was braver and smarter than any dog she'd ever met- and he could put on the charm to get just about whatever or whoever he wanted. Somewhere just beneath the hard man exterior though, was a real heart of gold, and every time it showed Rita would just get drawn in further. Sometimes she wondered if he did it on purpose to wind her up. Ever since they'd been pups, Rita had known that part of Dodger was there; he'd tenderly nursed her through a brush with death and made her into the dog she was today. When Dodger let his guard down and made that connection with her, Rita felt an overwhelming warm feeling of home. She realised that she couldn't deny to herself how she felt about him any longer. There was something, very subtle, just a slight change in the look in his eye when he glanced over at her; that led Rita to think that, just maybe, Dodger might be feeling the same way. It was more than she dared hope, but she'd have to take the risk and confront it with him sometime soon. \"Hey, slow down,\" Rita called after him. \"Where're you off to?\" Dodger turned around, his breath visible in the cold air as he panted slightly. \"I was headin' to Murphy's, just gonna see who's around.\" By 'Murphy's', Dodger was referring to the deserted warehouse by the docks, that now took the form of a meeting place and general socialising hub for street dogs. There were a few who permanently called the old building home, led by the ever-serious Murphy, who acted more as a guardian of the place than actually going out to find food anymore. Rita's litter sister also frequented the hangout, following a rough start to life in an abusive home. It was a sanctuary to some of the more damaged dogs who roamed New York's streets, and a place where all were welcome. \"You'd better hope Willow's not around; she's probably spent the whole few months since we've been 'round thinking up insults to hurl your way.\", said Rita. Dodger smirked. \"I can handle myself.\" He walked closer to Rita as she caught up with him. \"Besides, I think your little sister's just jealous of my charm.\" Rita raised an eyebrow at him. \"All right, you'd better try and keep a lid on that charisma of yours then, otherwise you might have a few pieces bitten out of you before we leave.\" They took the long route to the hangout, taking the time to enjoy a light-hearted chase through the slow-moving afternoon traffic. It was the first time in a long while that Rita had been able to really let herself go, free of the worries that came with the ongoing challenge just to keep fed and healthy. The sun on her back was a wonderful feeling after a long stretch of dreary, cloudy days, leaving her feeling energized and joyful. With Rita in high spirits, Dodger was more than happy to push her playful abandon as far as he could, daring her to keep up as he threw himself into one reckless stunt after another. Finally, they approached the warehouse, panting and laughing. Both of them immediately picked up the strong smell of dog that hung around the place. As they came to the main entrance, a large, shaggy grey-brown mixed breed stood up defensively, before relaxing as he recognised the visitors. \"Dodger! I've not seen you for a while, what's been keepin' ya? You haven't been bringin' home more cats have you?\" barked Murphy, who thought that the gang's association with Fagin was ridiculous enough, but the stories of their escapades with a kitten were truly something else. Dodger and Rita spent the next hour catching up with old acquaintances. The majority of the dogs that hung around the warehouse were of the same school of thought as Murphy; that spending too much time around humans was just plain idiotic, no matter how trustworthy a human companion could seem, the risk was never worth it. Because of this, Dodger and Rita were always received with great curiosity, and just a little disdain. Every now and then, a lanky hound appeared around the corner of the room before hastily retreating. \"Hey Rita, I'm gonna head over and see the kid for a bit. You gonna stay here to talk to your darlin' sis?\" \"Yeah, I probably should.\" Rita replied reluctantly. \"You say 'hi' to the kid for me though, okay Dodge?\" \"Absotively.\" he winked, and got up to leave, bumping his head playfully against her shoulder as he went. As soon as Dodger had moved out of earshot, a slim hound appeared at the doorway and sauntered over quietly to sit beside Rita. She was slightly thinner, slightly scruffier than her sister, with dull brown fur and her tail carried high and ringed. She studied Rita curiously, with a frown upon her features. Rita sighed, knowing from the look in her sister's eyes that she wasn't happy… but with Willow, that was the norm. \"Hey, Willow. You been keeping warm okay?\" \"Fine, thanks,\" Willow responded. \"You're looking all right yourself.\" She studied her sister carefully, and then threw a look to the door that Dodger left through. \"You and your mutt were looking pretty friendly just now, there's nothing going on is there?\" Rita was taken aback by her sister's accusatory tone. \"No, not really. We're just friends. Same as always.\" \"I saw the way you were looking at him, that arrogant little mutt's got you wrapped around his little paw.\" Willow scoffed. \"It took a lot of effort for me not to throw up.\" \"Maybe I do have feelings for him, but it really is none of your business. Don't pretend to know the first thing about Dodger and me, 'cause you really don't.\" Rita's fur bristled in anger. She was regretting staying behind to talk to Willow; she should have known that her sister would only want to pick a fight. Willow had never been particularly fond of any of the gang- even Rita, but she had always downright hated Dodger. \"You know, there's a whole lot more to Dodger than you think, just give him a break for once.\" \"Really, Rita? And here's me, thinking he's just a self-obsessed womaniser. I don't expect you to listen to me, but maybe just think for a moment before you get in too deep with this jerk. Do you honestly think he'd even have it in him to be faithful to you? To dogs like Dodger, women are just playthings. He wants all the attention he can get; no matter how much you might wish otherwise, one woman will never be enough for him.\" Rita had turned to leave, furious, but looked back to face her sister. \"You can think whatever you want, I've got better things to do than listen to you tearing apart my best friend. Whatever Dodger might be, he's always treated me a whole lot better than you ever have. I only stayed so I can talk to you, but you just can't stop yourself from picking a fight. Willow, you're gonna wind up real lonely if this is how you treat anyone who makes an effort with you.\" \"Just go back to your jerk of a mutt, Rita. He must be lost without the head of his fan club singing his praises,\" Willow jeered. \"Don't come crying to me when he uses you and drops you straight after.\" Rita left the abandoned warehouse feeling angry and upset. She wondered why she even bothered with her sister, who did nothing but lash out. While she knew that Willow was mostly just full of hot air, some of her words had touched a nerve. What was it that she really wanted with Dodger? She'd had several relationships in the past, but they'd never lasted long. Being as closely bonded as she was to Fagin and the gang, it wasn't easy to find anyone accepting of that part of her life- especially as most street dogs had a deeply ingrained hatred of humans. It wasn't that she didn't like the idea of having a single committed mate; a part of Rita imagined herself settled with a devoted lover and a litter of pups at her paws. But all the same, she never felt as though she needed all that in her life; she was perfectly happy already. It was just Dodger… he brought out a longing in her that she was beginning to wish would just fade away. Rita couldn't help but wonder if it was the long-brewing feelings she had for Dodger that had gotten in the way of romance elsewhere all those times before. No one else had ever touched her in quite the same way. But did Dodger want her in the way that she wanted him? Even if he did, did he have it in him to make a real commitment? However much she cared about him, Rita still felt those doubts at the back of her mind. Doing her best to shake off Willow's words, Rita headed home to the barge. The thought of being amongst friendlier folk- and of enjoying whatever was left of Einstein's Christmas pudding, sure was inviting. It was already dark by the time Dodger came close to Oliver's place. A part of him had wanted to stay back with Rita; he'd always enjoyed teasing her sister, it was all too easy to get a rise out of Willow. But it had been a while since he'd seen the kid, and his being around did little to improve Rita's relationship with Willow. It occurred to him that it might be worth talking to Oliver about Rita… when Dodger woke up that morning, lying beside her, he'd finally decided that he needed to try and move forward with their own relationship. Sure the kid was young, there was no one else he could talk to, not about something like that. Tito and Francis would think it a massive joke, and Einstein was likely to accidentally say something out of place to Rita. While Dodger was continually wrestling with his thoughts, he was glad that Oliver was around to lend a listening ear, even if it was a hard subject to broach. He barked an announcement of his arrival and waited. Perhaps he was imagining it, but it felt like Oliver was taking his time. Oliver made an appearance at the window and let Dodger in, his expression sour. \"It's kinda late, Dodge, you know Jenny's home from school.\" Dodger was less than impressed by Oliver's unenthusiastic response to his presence. It was unusual. \"Come on, kid, she's not goin' to mind. I've not seen you in ages. Besides, I want to talk to you 'bout something.\" Evie's voice called out from the next room, \"Ollie, it's just Dodger isn't it?\" \"Yep, you can come on in,\" Oliver called back. He looked to Dodger, not really wanting to turn him away but a little put out by the disruption to his evening. With Jenny home from school, it was meant to be his special time with her. He supposed it wouldn't make much difference if Dodger stuck around for a little while as Jenny was busy eating her dinner for the time being. \"It's good to see you, Dodge, just maybe come a little earlier next time.\" \"Good to see you too, Ollie ,\" Dodger smirked. Knowing that there was nothing to fear from the mutt, the smaller cat trotted jauntily into the room to join them. Evie placed herself right by Oliver's side, and he purred in her presence. They all moved up to Jenny's bedroom, whilst its usual inhabitant was downstairs enjoying her dinner. The two cats walked side by side, close enough that their fur brushed against one another, and quickly immersing themselves back into a conversation, with Dodger bringing up the rear. Evie was much more confident than she had been on his previous visits, and it was difficult to get a word in edgeways with Oliver busy fawning over her. Maybe it was because Evie had only one dog to deal with this time. Dodger was quite sure that he liked it better when Evie was too shy to stick around when Oliver had visitors… and he'd definitely rather Oliver dropped that simpering love-struck expression from his face. After a while of being given very little notice from his friend, Dodger wondered if it was worth him even being there at all with the kid so distracted, especially when he could have kept enjoying himself with Rita. Oliver should be grateful that he made the effort to be with him! \"So Dodger,\" Oliver had finally turned his attention away from his pretty companion, \"Did Einstein and Rita tell you that they came round here yesterday? Are you guys finding enough to eat? They were both looking pretty thin. You're welcome to take from my bowl at any time if you're hungry, Winston is always refilling it.\" \"We're fine,\" Dodger said, a little too harshly, resenting the implication that he wasn't taking proper care of his gang- as if this spoiled cat had a clue. \"You can keep your pity offerings.\" Oliver fell quiet, realising quickly that Dodger was even less likely to accept a well-intentioned offer of assistance than Rita had been. Evie shifted nervously beside him, and he felt for her. After an uncomfortable silence, Oliver spoke. \"Sorry, I'm only trying to help. Do you think you could bring someone round here with you next time? We've been talking about it, and we think Evie's ready to meet someone new… just maybe not Einstein, he's probably still gonna be too scary for her.\" \"You didn't meet Einstein yesterday?\" Dodger asked Evie. He noticed that hadn't taken long for Oliver to turn the conversation back to his new friend, but at least he was now included in the discussion. Evie shook her head. \"I was a little scared, just because Oliver said that Einstein is really big.\" \"You're gonna have to get over that sometime, kid! Einy's not gonna hurt no one,\" Dodger said gruffly. \"Or maybe you should just give up and live up in the attic where no one will come and scare ya.\" \"Give her a break, Dodger!\" Oliver stepped in, surprised by Dodger's sudden unhelpfulness. He quickly turned his attention back to Evie, fearful that she'd been upset by Dodger's being less than friendly. She looked frightened, as though she couldn't trust that Dodger wasn't going to suddenly lash out. \"Hey, I'm only tryin' to help! It's not my fault she's making a big deal over nothing.\" Oliver's face had hardened. Why was Dodger suddenly being so difficult? \"You can't talk to her like that, she's my friend, part of the family.\" It seemed to Dodger that the cat's family was growing a bit too fast for his liking- and room was going to run out for him in Oliver's life. \"Fine. But d'you wanna go hang out, just us?\" \"Dodger, I…\" Oliver started, but he was stopped his tracks by the bedroom door swinging open. Jenny had finished her meal and had quickly come back upstairs to play with her beloved kitties. Dodger greeted her with a wagging tail, but his heart sank as he knew that any chance of getting quality time with Oliver without anyone intruding had gone. The kid was already all over her little mistress and purring, and Dodger might as well have not been there. Finally having had enough, Dodger left to go home. Oliver was just too distracted to really hang out with him the way they used to, and for the first time ever, Dodger got the feeling that Oliver was growing up and away from him. It felt like their relationship was changing, and as far as Dodger was concerned, it wasn't for the better. There was so much that he'd wanted to talk to the kid about, but there was no chance of that when Oliver clearly didn't really want Dodger to be there. Despite knowing that Oliver hadn't even been aware that it was happening, Dodger was hurt- the little cat had found yet another person to take his place. As if sharing his feline brother with Jenny wasn't enough! He'd barely gotten over the sadness he'd felt over Oliver leaving the gang, and already he was drifting even further away. Dodger hoped desperately that it was just a response to Evie's newfound confidence, and that Oliver would get over the excitement soon. Didn't he understand just how much he meant to him? As he carried on home, taking the longest possible route so he could just be left alone with his troubled thoughts, Dodger couldn't help thinking of his first taste of rejection, years ago when he was just a pup. The abandonment by his own mother had left the young Dodger deeply hurt and mistrustful. She'd walked out on him, leaving him with Fagin at only a month old, unwilling to take responsibility for the pup. At the time, the mother had told a bewildered Einstein that she was returning to her previous master, that she really couldn't handle the street life and that her master would never welcome the pup. It wasn't until many months later that Dodger discovered the truth. He stumbled across his mother at a gathering of street dogs, surrounded by eager males. Dodger found out that she'd never gone home- she'd simply dumped her son in order to live a carefree life with no responsibilities. Apparently it was too difficult to have a good time with a pup in tow. When he talked to her she didn't even recognise him, barely offering him even a glance, other than to briefly taunt him; he was nothing but a bad memory to her, a mistake that was erased at first opportunity. The discovery that his own mother had simply never wanted him had left the young Dodger shell-shocked, and he kept the knowledge to himself for many weeks, before eventually confiding in Rita who'd promised to keep it between the two of them. It had taken a lot for Dodger to share something that had hurt him so deeply and filled him with shame, but it had strengthened the bond he had with Rita and had given a firm foundation to a friendship that had now lasted several years. The experience had left Dodger reluctant to get close to anyone, and the strong bonds he'd formed with his small circle of friends were all the more important to him as a result. It was also the reason why it had been so utterly heart wrenching for him to let Oliver go, and why his rejection hurt so much. With the sun's warmth now gone, the biting cold returned with a vengeance, and the miserable night complimented Dodger's mood perfectly. Thinking of his mother, and of Oliver; Dodger wondered what it was about him that drove everyone away. He'd built his defences high, but that didn't do much to lessen the blow every time that it turned out that he, Dodger, wasn't enough for someone who mattered to him. As he approached the barge, he thought about Rita once again. He'd been so sure that he was ready to tell her how he felt, that he loved her, and perhaps they could try and take things further between them. Dodger sighed miserably, all the certainty that he'd felt that morning and been lost. Perhaps he'd be better off if he just left things as they were; if he couldn't pull off the whole relationship thing, he could end up losing someone else that he loved. Dodger knew that if he drove Rita away, after all they'd been through together, it would tear him apart, and who knew what the effect might be on the gang as a whole. She was family, and what they had was worth too much for him to risk it falling to pieces. He went down towards the boat, dreading seeing Rita again and feeling utterly deflated. Rita came home to find Fagin had returned, and that her master was delighted with all that the dogs had brought in earlier. As Rita greeted him, Fagin pulled the woolly Christmas jumper over her head, and helped her front legs through the sleeves. The baggy sweater was not remotely flattering- and Tito, Francis and Einstein roared with laughter, but at least it was nice and warm. With a quick glance around, Rita saw that Dodger had yet to come home. On her way to her bed, she took a mouthful of pudding (taking care to avoid slobbery bits from where the others had dug in), and lay down for a welcome rest and bite to eat. It was very late indeed by time that Dodger had finally dragged himself back to the barge; the mutt taken the longest route home that he could, unwilling to face the others while feeling so miserable. Fagin was already settled in his chair and reading aloud to a captivated audience. Dodger stole past them and went straight to his bed. He could feel Rita staring at him, but didn't let himself turn to look back at her. There was much that he wanted to say, but it would only complicate things. He had to keep his distance, avoid the temptation of looking into those pretty eyes and letting his feelings out. Rita quietly approached Dodger's bed. \"Hey baby, you okay?\" \"Fine.\" Dodger replied harshly, and shifted away from her slightly. There wouldn't be any cuddling tonight, no matter how cold it got. Rita continued to look at him for a moment, wondering what could possibly have upset Dodger so much. He was like a completely different person to the dog that she'd spent most of the day with. Just a few short hours ago he'd been full of the joys, laughing with her and revelling in her attention. Surely, a visit to see Oliver should have lifted his spirits further- he absolutely adored that kid. But something was definitely wrong. Rita returned to her bed, confused and a little hurt, and curled her back legs and tail into the sweater. It was warm, but it was nothing like the comfort of snuggling up to her closest friend. All she could do was hope that he'd be feeling more himself in the morning. As Tito, Francis and Einstein settled down for the night they all looked over curiously to Dodger, and then to Rita, seeing a scene very different to the one the previous night and wondering what had changed. Dodger sighed quietly, trying to ignore the unwanted attention of his companions. Exhausted after getting himself worked up into such a state, he closed his eyes and waited for sleep to come and give him an escape from the worried stares of his friends.[Chapter 6] Rita awoke the next morning to a more cheerful Dodger. She got the impression that something was still not quite right with him, and noticed that he seemed to be avoiding her. It wasn't that he was hostile, just acting as though she wasn't even there. Rita was confused, wondering what on earth had changed Dodger's attitude toward her so dramatically- it had been so little time since he had been closer to her than ever before; and now he just didn't want to be around her. While Dodger's avoidance of her stung, she was happy to see he was at least a bit more upbeat than the previous night. She watched his every move closely, searching for any clues as to what had so deeply troubled him, and what she'd done to push him away like this, but as per the norm, Dodger made every effort to disguise any weakness. If only she could get him alone to talk… but that would be easier said than done while he was actively keeping out of her way. Rita's thoughts were interrupted by the unexpected sound of a car outside. Everyone immediately looked around, fully alert. No one ever drove down their way. Not since Sykes, and he was long gone. Rita joined Dodger at the doorway, hackles raised, ready to defend Fagin should the need arise. They shared a supportive glance, any tension between them put to one side for the time being as they prepared to see off a threat. Fagin moved forward, cautiously approaching the door to investigate, when a knocking sounded. Dodger stayed protectively by his master's side, but was more curious than concerned- any dangerous intruder was more likely to force their way in rather than politely knock the door. Rita waited, tense, for a sign from Dodger as to who was there. She exhaled in relief as Fagin brought a rather disorientated Winston through the door. She'd forgotten that Winston had been to the barge before, having brought Oliver over for a visit a few months earlier. The others gathered around in great interest and wagging tails as they saw that Winston came with several large bags of dog food, and warm blankets. \"I'm very sorry Mr Fagin, but I can't stay,\" Winston said hurriedly, from behind a large bag of kibble. \"Jennifer and I would like to invite you to come and spend Christmas Day with us. Unfortunately her parents have just gone away again, and she would so love to have you all join us for the day. You can imagine how disheartening it is for the poor child, and I know it would mean a great deal to her if you could join us. Jennifer has also been concerned that your dogs are rather underweight as late, I hope that these will be of some help.\" Fagin took Winston's hand and shook it enthusiastically in gratitude. \"Thank you!\" he stammered, his voice full of ill-disguised excitement, \"Thank you very much!\" \"Not at all,\" the butler said kindly, though he felt as though his hand might be shaken right off his wrist. \"It is thanks to your bravery that Jenny came home safely that dreadful night. That won't be forgotten. I feel we should have been doing more to help you out, especially in this ghastly weather we've been having.\" The news of the invitation was met with stupendous excitement. Everyone was thrilled to be spending Christmas with Oliver at the Foxworths' place; it would certainly be a welcome change from spending Christmas Day out in the cold. Only Dodger was subdued. After his experience the previous day, the thought of visiting his feline brother just wasn't as exciting as it usually would be. Chances were, Oliver would snuff him all over again. Rita noticed how unenthused Dodger was by the promise of spending time with Oliver, which left her confused, this certainly wasn't like the Dodger she was used to. What could have happened last night to get him so low? Dodger headed off into the city shortly after Winston left; there was no real reason to work today, but he felt that he needed some space to himself so he could just be alone with his thoughts. Christmas was just over a week away, and Dodger hoped that Oliver's obsession with his new friend would wear off a little before they all came to visit. He really missed the kid since he'd gone to live in that big house, and it had hurt Dodger deeply to find that even when he did visit Oliver their connection wasn't there in the way that it had been before. He needed to get away from the rest of the gang for the day. Right now he didn't feel like being around anyone, and his conflicted feelings towards Rita were not helping in the slightest. Dodger hopped in the back of Fagin's scooter, and headed off with his master. Watching as Dodger left, Rita had to fight the urge to follow. She'd known Dodger long enough to realise that pushing him too hard to open up and share his feelings only made him build his defences higher. She resigned herself to the fact that there wasn't a whole lot she could do for him, and decided to let herself enjoy the opportunity to have a relaxing day, with no need to find food for a change. Examining the new blankets, she chose a soft blue one to drag into her bed. Finally, she might be able to make her bed into something truly cosy. Einstein was already chewing at the corner of the largest bag of kibble, tearing a hole in the top so as to get to the much wanted contents. Francis and Tito were looking on eagerly, their eyes wide and saliva forming at their mouths. Even when jumping up and down, Tito could not reach the top of the bag, and Einstein had to shovel out some biscuits with his large paws for that the Chihuahua could tuck in. \"Hey guys, go easy won't you? We want it to last a while.\" Rita grumbled from her bed. Who knew when this streak of rotten weather would let up? This food was precious, and it was endlessly frustrating that she seemed to be the only one who realised that. \"Come on, chica ! Don't ya want breakfast in bed\" Tito kicked a few pieces of kibble in Rita's direction. \"Tito, that's not 'in bed', that's in the middle of the floor.\" Rita got up to eat all the same, whilst keeping an eye on Einstein, who was all but climbing inside the bag- quite a feat for such a large dog. \"Einy! Take it easy! You're gonna be sorry when it's gone.\" Rita returned to her bed, and curled up in the soft folds of the new blanket. She was vaguely aware of the others having an animated and somewhat heated discussion over what they should watch on the television. It occurred to Rita that maybe Oliver would be able to shed some light on what was up with Dodger, and that it might be worth paying him a visit to see if he knew what set Dodger's mood off. It would also be a good opportunity to thank the kid for the gifts from his family; Rita knew that Oliver had been concerned about the gang's rough patch and that he'd wanted to help. That could wait though. For the time being, Rita was going to enjoy a relaxing day at home; it had been far too long since she'd had one. It took a lot of will power for Rita to drag herself outside that evening, leaving behind warm blankets and all the food she could hope for. Still, she felt she had to talk to Oliver, the only person who might know how Dodger could be helped through whatever it was that had been troubling him. It was already dark out, and the fact that Dodger still hadn't made an appearance back at the barge strengthened her resolve. It wasn't exactly unusual for him to stay out late, but as it was accompanied with his odd behaviour since the night before, Rita was worried about him. Usually, visits to see Oliver took place during the day while there tended not to be any humans around who might object to having dogs coming and going, but Rita was certain that Jenny wouldn't mind too much- after all, it was the little girl's concern for the dogs' wellbeing that had led to the generous gift of food and blankets earlier that day. The lights glowing in the windows confirmed that everyone was home. Rita barked outside the front door. She shivered, the cold already biting, and hoped that it wouldn't be long before someone let her in. It was Jenny who came to the door, and as hoped, she was thrilled to have a guest and was soon in the kitchen rustling up something nice for Rita to eat. Winston wasn't quite so happy to have a dirty street dog in the house, but didn't fuss about it for Jenny's sake, aware that she was feeling very sensitive and needing reasons to smile. Oliver bounded down the stairs to greet Rita, a cheery spring in his step and Evie following a short way behind him. \"Hey, Rita! What are you doing here so late? Isn't it a bit cold out?\" called Oliver as her padded over. He hadn't left the house all day, but it certainly didn't look like nice weather outside. \"Hi,\" said Evie without any hesitation. By now she'd decided that Rita wasn't someone to be scared of. Rita smiled warmly, \"Hey, you two. I thought I'd better thank you guys for the gift earlier, can't tell you how good it is to have a new blanket in my bed- I've been freezing my tail off.\" \"You're welcome,\" said Oliver. After previous attempts of his to help his friends had been most unwelcome he was pleased to know that Jenny's gestured had been received well. \"I'm kinda nervous to have all you guys round here for Christmas, but I'm excited too,\" said Evie. \"If Oliver's going to be around, then I won't be so scared.\" Oliver beamed proudly and gazed adoringly at the smaller cat, who looked just as smitten as he did. \"Course I'll look after you, Evie, no one's gonna hurt you while I'm around.\" The little show off , thought Rita. It appeared that Oliver had hit adolescence with a vengeance. \"Actually, I think none of us have any intention of hurting you whether you've got Ollie standing guard or not,\" she said, \"You know you can trust us, okay sweetie?\" Very quickly the two cats were jabbering on- about the time Jenny took them to school for show-and-tell, about the time Evie got stuck on top of the grandfather clock, too afraid to get down, about the new song Oliver had been 'helping' Jenny out with on the piano, about the time Oliver made Evie her own little fort out of books in the library… the stories kept coming, and Oliver seemed scarcely able to take his eyes off Evie. It was sweet and all, but Rita could imagine Dodger getting put out by this new obsession. Used to being the centre of attention, it didn't seem likely that he'd appreciate struggling to get a word in edgeways. \"So, kid,\" Rita said, finally finding a break in the conversation, \"Did Dodge seem okay when he was here last night? Don't tell him I'm asking you 'bout this, but he's not been himself since he came back from here. I was just wondering if you had any idea what was bugging him.\" Oliver shrugged. \"He was kinda grouchy. He got all huffy when I asked if he wanted some food from my bowl…\" he hesitated a moment trying to ascertain whether Rita would respond similarly, \"I was a little worried 'cause you and Einy didn't look so good.\" Rita frowned, not appreciating concerns for her wellbeing from someone living in the lap of luxury and very little idea of the realities of her life, but she said nothing of it. Proud though she was, she had bigger things to worry about. \"And he was acting really weird to Evie too,\" Oliver continued. \"-Yeah, he was real rude. Like he didn't like me, but he never seemed to have a problem before,\" said Evie, \"It hurt my feelings a little.\" \"I know it can seem like Dodger has all the sensitivity of a steam roller, but he cares. I just feel like something must have happened; we were having a great time, and then he came back from here and he wasn't the same dog.\" They were interrupted by Jenny's bringing over a bowl of dog biscuits and breakfast cereal topped with whipped cream. Rita gratefully licked the little girl's fingers and started to tuck in. Somehow it bothered her less to take food offered by Jenny than by Oliver. It felt less like she was stealing from friends, and no one was going to get in trouble over such sharing. \"You've no idea what might have upset him, then?\" asked Rita, looking up before Oliver could steer the conversation back towards his pretty new friend. An offer of food surely couldn't have done anything to bother Dodger so much- and it certainly didn't explain why he'd been avoiding Rita who'd left him perfectly happy in her company beforehand. Oliver just shook his head. \"I dunno. Maybe the weather's put him in a bad mood? I wish he wouldn't take it out on Evie though, she's done nothing wrong.\" Rita sighed. \"Well, thanks, I guess,\" she said. \"If he comes round here, let me know if he's all right, okay?\" \"Sure, I can do that,\" Oliver said. \"I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. He's gotta be excited about you all having Christmas with us- it's gonna be such a big step for Evie, and I'll need his help.\" Again, it came back to Evie. It was hard to resent that though; Rita knew that Oliver was just trying to help his friend through a scary time in her life, all the while suffering his first crush. Though he clearly didn't know how to show it, Oliver wanted Dodger to be a part of it all. Left with little to go on, Rita supposed she'd just have to bite the bullet and try to have a proper talk with Dodger. The only thing that really seemed to have changed was the fact that Evie was now confidently including herself- and Oliver came across as being downright besotted with her. Knowing how much Oliver had meant to him, it certainly wasn't too much of a stretch to imagine that Dodger might be jealous. Still, Rita just couldn't understand the change in his attitude towards her, it simply made no sense. Why was Dodger so keen to avoid her? She had to get to the bottom of this.[Chapter 7] As Rita was finishing her goodbyes, she saw Dodger hastily move away from the Foxworth home. She wondered how long he had been sitting there, watching the house in silence. Quickly, she moved after him, keen to take the opportunity to talk to him without anyone else around. Dodger sighed. There was no way of pretending she wasn't there now, no avoiding this one without causing a real fall-out between the two of them. He stood and waited for Rita to catch up, hoping that she'd soon just leave him be. The decision that he'd made was for her own good, and in time, he wouldn't need to keep his distance so much… he'd train himself to see Rita as a sister- completely off limits, but that wouldn't happen overnight. Rita panted a little as she caught up with Dodger, her hot breath visible in the cool night air. She walked along beside him. \"What're you doin' out here Dodge?\" she asked, slightly out of breath. \"What about you? I would have thought that you'd be stayin' in, outta the cold. You're already shiverin'.\" \"Just checking in with the kid, saying thanks for all the food. I was wondering how Evie was going, and how she was gonna handle having the whole gang round-\" \"Bet he liked that, he could talk about his little girlfriend all day and never get bored.\" Dodger scowled. Rita was slightly taken aback by the hostility in Dodger's voice, and realised that her suspicions about what had upset him so much were spot on. \"Come on, Dodge, he's growing up! You can't expect to be the centre of his little universe all the time. Of course he's going to be a bit carried away with his interest in Evie- he can't have a lot of exposure to girls shut up in that big house.\" Rita couldn't help thinking that Dodger was overreacting. \"You know what that kid means to me, do ya think it's easy losin' him after all that's happened?\" Dodger growled, hearing his fears out loud made them seem more real. \"You're not losing him,\" Rita said, exasperated, \"Oliver looks up to you… he loves you. You can't just start pushing him further away because of what others have done to you. He's different.\" Rita was frustrated with Dodger's inability to cope with the perceived threat to his friendship with Oliver, but at the same time felt sympathetic towards him. She knew that this would be hard for him to take; Oliver meant so much to him and it was natural to fear losing something like that. Dodger raised his hackles defensively, but he quickly forced himself to calm down. Getting into a fight with Rita wouldn't do anything to improve the situation. She was obviously only trying to help; Dodger often wished she'd just leave him be, but he knew she had good intentions. \"I don't know what to do,\" he said, \"The kid's changed somethin' in me… I didn't want to care so much, but I can't get away from it.\" \"Honey, you're just gonna have to learn to trust him. You've given too much of yourself not to, you'll just keep on hurtin' yourself otherwise,\" said Rita. \"You think it's easy for me to just blindly trust?\" Dodger demanded, \"You know what…\" He stopped himself unable to talk about his mother, even in the heat of his frustration. \"He already left me, Rita,\" he said, righting himself, \"How can I expect anything else?\" Rita sighed. \"I don't know. But you're gonna have to find a way through it, for both your sakes. I know he's all caught up with Evie right now, but Oliver would be heartbroken if you just walked away. After what you've already come through together, there's no way he'd ever want to lose you.\" Dodger slowly relaxed his stance, knowing deep down that Rita was right about this one. There was nothing for it but to stick it out and hope for the best. \"All that food they gave us, we're not going to need to work so hard for a while,\" Rita said. \"Maybe you should take the kid out sometime… a bit of male bonding time or whatever it is you do. I don't think you'll have to worry about Evie following you around once you two get out of the house.\" Relieved to see Dodger calming down a little, she decided to risk pushing him to open up a bit more. \"So, if that's what's been bothering you, why have you been avoiding me?\" she asked earnestly. \"You can't tell me that you're jealous 'cause I was spending time with my sister. I'll tell you now; I'd take your company over hers any day!\" In spite of everything, Dodger smirked. \"Nah, it's nothin' like that.\" He noticed that the concerned look on her face wasn't shifting. Why did Rita always have to be so stubbornly worried about him all the time? \"Really, it's nothing, Rit.\" \"So we're all right then?\" Rita was still confused by Dodger's behaviour, but was happy that Dodger was at least talking to her again. He wasn't an easy person to get close to, and she'd learned long ago to just accept small victories. Dodger was still not sure about how to deal with their changing relationship, but realised that pushing Rita away was only making things worse. She didn't deserve to feel as though she'd wronged him, when nothing could be farther from the truth. Even as he knew this, he just couldn't bring himself to just tell her how he'd been feeling. It couldn't come to anything anyhow, so there was no point in making her feel uncomfortable. \"Course we are, pals to the end you and me.\" He playfully nudged his head against her shoulder, and appreciated the smile that it brought to her face. The pair carried on through the city streets together, and the tension that had built up between them had soon disappeared into the cold evening air. Dodger strutted around with his usual self-confidence and swagger, telling a rather exaggerated story of a recent escapade… not that he thought for a moment that Rita was buying a word of it. Whether she was convinced or not, Dodger knew that such stories always amused her. Rita rubbed her head affectionately against Dodger's as they walked, happy to have her beloved friend back to his old self. Suddenly it was as if the previous night had never happened. All the same, Rita wanted to reassure him that she was there for him. As they came to a quiet alley, she stopped, and gently pulled Dodger nearer to her by his bandanna. He looked amused, eyeing her curiously, one eyebrow cocked. \"It's so good to have you back to normal,\" Rita said, \"You had me real worried there. And don't be afraid of caring so much, or showing it. You're strong enough to put your heart on the line, and deep down you know it's worth it.\" She paused for a moment, trying to find the right words to reassure her friend, and shivered slightly in the cold. \"No matter what anyone else might do, I'd never leave you- not ever. You do know that, right?\" Dodger looked into Rita's eyes and saw only sincerity there. He had to believe that she meant every word. He trusted her. \"Yeah, I know. We're solid.\" Rita smiled, and playfully nuzzled his face. She felt that the time was right to tell him, otherwise she might just keep on hiding her feelings forever. As much as she feared rejection by the person she cared about most in the world, she couldn't hold it in any longer. \"I love you, Dodge,\" Rita whispered. Her heart was pounding hard against her chest as she spoke. \"More than I can say.\" She continued, her voice growing stronger and more confident. \"I know it's probably never going to come to anything, but I can't stop feelin' it, and I'm not ashamed to say it.\" Rita could barely believe that she'd said it out loud after all this time; and she blushed fiercely beneath her fur. She held her breath, waiting, not knowing how he'd react to her confession. Exposing her true feelings to someone like Dodger was a huge gamble, and the moments' wait for his response agonising. Dodger's eyes widened and he stared at her in surprise. Rita had caught him off guard; even though he was aware of her attraction to him, he'd managed to convince himself, despite the feeling deep down that she was in love with him, that it was all just his imagination. It had been easier that way, with no risk of hurting a dear friend. But there was something in the way she said those words that told him loud and clear that it wasn't just an expression of friendship- she wanted more. Having just spent the past night and day telling himself that it would never work, Dodger was briefly at a loss for how to respond, his mind racing. \"Ya know; we don't have to head back just yet,\" he said, his usual self-confident smirk returning to his face, his decision almost made. \"If you're not too cold, you and I could hang out for a while.\" Dodger headed casually back out onto the sidewalk, gesturing to Rita to follow and giving no outward impression of the battle still unfolding in his head. Finally, he decided that he had to trust his deeper feelings- it was time to take the plunge. Rita was disheartened by Dodger's lack of response to the confession that had taken her so long to build up the courage to make. She was certain that she'd just made a real fool of herself, making herself vulnerable and all for nothing. Still, however much it hurt, she'd just shake it off; if nothing else, they were still the closest of friends. As Rita reached Dodger's side, he quickly leaned up to lick her cheek and said quietly in her ear, \"Love you too, Rita.\" He flashed a cocky grin, and dashed out, leaping away and onto the roof of a nearby car. Rita's heart skipped a beat at those words, the words that sounded more wonderful than she'd even imagined. Although stunned for a moment, she was soon hot on Dodger's heels, lifted by the feeling of ecstasy that pulsed through her. As they chased one another through the busy streets, moving through the bustling city with the greatest of ease, Rita was filled with an indescribable joy. Taking in the atmosphere of the bright city lights against the snowy night, Rita couldn't imagine anything more beautiful; and now she had Dodger with her sharing in her happiness. She ran after him, overwhelmed by a desire to be close to him- suddenly there was nothing else that mattered. They skidded joyfully across the snow-laden cars, sending powder flying out into the air. Faster and faster, they ran side by side, tails high in euphoria as they shared in a dance through their noisy and constantly-moving home. After skilfully manoeuvring themselves up onto a rooftop, the pair playfully pounced and nipped at one-another, laughing the whole time. Backing her up toward the edge, Dodger looked lovingly into Rita's face. Her soft dark eyes searched his, looking for confirmation that he'd meant what he'd said. Dodger had never imagined that he would feel this way, and yet it felt right. There had never been anyone else, not like this. He leaned closer, feeling the tickle of her whiskers as their muzzles met, and drew her into a sweet and loving kiss. Rita closed her eyes, allowing herself to get lost in the moment. The kiss was everything she'd ever dreamed, and she was filled with a brilliant warmth that defied the icy wind. She'd never felt closer to Dodger, her best friend in all the world, and it was wonderful. She laughed as she finally came away, and snuggled up to Dodger as he nuzzled her neck and ran his tongue tenderly over her body. Rita felt a pleasurable shiver run up her spine as he caressed her neck and chest, and she let out a soft moan which brought a grin to his face. She then reciprocated, lovingly licking his ears, his face, his neck. They collapsed in a heap, huddled close to keep out the cold, kissing and laughing until they could barely breathe. \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" Rita said softly once she'd gotten her breath back, looking out at the wonderful view of the home that they both loved. The gentle snowfall was soft and fluffy, giving the evening a magical quality. She stuck her tongue out playfully to catch a snowflake. \"You should see it from where I'm sitting.\" Dodger grinned, admiring his friend turned lover. He didn't know if he'd ever seen Rita so completely lit up with happiness, and she looked all the more beautiful to him for it. Her eyes were sparkling with pure joy and deepest affection. He felt an enormous weight lifted off his chest; they were finally together and it was more than he could have imagined. There was something oddly thrilling about leaning in to kiss the old friend he'd known near all his life, all the boundaries falling away. Rita relaxed into him, closing her eyes blissfully as he licked her. Away from the rest of the world, they revelled in their newfound intimacy, passionately loving one another without a hint of apprehension. They were together at last. Dodger and Rita lay side by side, enjoying watching the world go by and one another's loving company. The pair lost track of time, caught up in the pleasure of being together, but were brought back to reality as the light snowfall suddenly became heavy. Though they made their way back towards the barge, by the time they reached the docks the weather had become too wild to continue onwards. Rita took shelter in an overturned shipping crate facing away from the wind. Dodger followed after, and lay down close to her, with his chest against hers and his paws draped over her back. \"I love you, Rita.\" Dodger said, his heart still pounding against his chest with exhilaration each time he said it. He came together with her in a long, tender kiss. \"I love you too, Dodgie-baby.\" Rita whispered as they parted, and she pressed her forehead against his. The pleasure of finally being able to openly express her affections to the friend whom she loved so much was near overwhelming. She'd not fully realised just how much she'd been holding onto for the past few years, and it was a huge relief to know that she'd no longer need to suppress the extent of her feelings toward Dodger. What lay ahead for them as a pair was a great unknown, a vague notion that couldn't even be properly considered in the whirl of excitement that had taken over. They loved one another, and huddled up together for the night, sheltered from the cold and howling wind, that was all that really mattered.[Chapter 8] Dodger woke up late the next morning to find Rita still fast asleep, huddled up beside him. During a break in the wild weather the night before, he'd found a thick, heavy blanket in one of the many crates littered around nearby boats. The two dogs had curled up together in the blanket's soft, heavy folds, and it made for a very comfortable night's sleep, despite the snowfall that surrounded them. Even as he lay there beside Rita, Dodger felt a twinge of doubt, and wondered if he'd made a huge mistake in allowing his relationship with his good friend to change so dramatically. Last night had been wonderful, but that didn't mean that everything wouldn't fall apart in the future. Had he simply let passion get the better of him? There was no going back now, and whether he'd admit it or not, that was scary. He gently ran his paw down Rita's side and watched her sleep, allowing himself to push away his fears. She looked peaceful and content, and beautiful even in her poor condition. As vivid memories of the night before rolled around Dodger's head, he smiled. Something so good simply couldn't have been a mistake. Rita stirred, and felt Dodger's gaze upon her. She moved herself around slightly so she could look him in the face. Dodger's eyes held a great tenderness, and it warmed her to the core. \"Morning, Dodge,\" she whispered, her eyes still bleary and half-closed. Dodger leaned in and licked her cheek. \"You sleep all right, hot stuff?\" Rita smiled and nodded, the events of the night before coming back to her. \"Best sleep I've had in ages. You must have really tired me out last night.\" She gave Dodger a cheeky wink. \"You?\" \"Yeah, I had a good night. We've probably slept through a little late though. Any chance of subtly slinkin' home before sun up is long gone.\" Dodger stretched out as he got to his feet. Ideally he would have liked to have kept this new development between the two of them, at least to begin with, but in reality it would never have taken long for someone to work out what was going on anyhow. Still, he could have done without the extra pressure of having everyone knowing that he and Rita were moving their relationship forward, especially when he wasn't sure himself where it would all be going. Dodger would just have to put up with the inevitable teasing until the novelty wore off- and it wasn't as if he had anything to be ashamed of- and hope that he and Rita could settle into this new phase with as few bumps in the road as possible. \"We're really gonna cop it from the guys, aren't we?\" Rita furrowed her eyebrows, but kept grinning all the same. She couldn't be happier, and if the others found it funny that would be nothing to her. This was new territory for the pair of them, but she had enough faith in their friendship that there was no room for fear. \"Absitively posolutely,\" Dodger yawned. \"I don't think any of this will surprise anyone, but Tito for one is going to think this is hilarious.\" Rita scoffed. \"We're gonna get some serious payback for laughing at him and Georgette, but still, I don't think he's in any position to tease. If last night's anything to go by, we've got something pretty good goin' on here.\" She got up and moved over to Dodger, licking his ear playfully. Rita could still barely believe that the events of the night before had even happened; just as things had gone downhill, suddenly it had all turned into something special. \"Love you, Dodge\" she said, and she relaxed into a long and tender kiss. \"I'm sorry it took so long for me to tell you, to be sure of what I really wanted. I didn't even want to admit to myself that I was in love with you, even though I'd felt it for years. Guess I was scared.\" \"I doubt I'd have been ready to hear it from you earlier. It doesn't really matter anyhow; we can always make up for lost time.\" Dodger nipped at her fur affectionately. He shrugged his shoulders. \"I still don't even know what I'm doin', but I do know that I love you. I think I'm ready to give settlin' down a shot, and make this work. I've never felt this way about any other woman; it's you, and it's only you. And if it doesn't work out, it won't change our friendship, 'cause that's forever, right?\" Rita nuzzled Dodger, smiling at him. \"Right.\" Those words meant more than her than she could say. As a team, the two of them could do anything, they might just be able to do this… together as lovers after all this time. Suddenly, a thought came to Rita. \"You gonna go see the kid today, honey? You'd probably feel a lot better if sort out all those issues you were having with him. I bet he'd appreciate some help getting Evie ready for Christmas Day.\" \"I guess so.\" Dodger frowned. He wasn't keen to go and see Oliver, only to feel constantly brushed aside. Dealing with his insecurities surrounding the kid wasn't nearly as appealing as the thought of spending the whole day fooling around with his new lover. Obviously, he'd have to get past the jealousy he felt if he wanted to have Oliver in his life, but he didn't want to be left feeling kicked aside as he had been just a couple of nights ago. Thinking back to the day of his disastrous visit to his feline brother, he remembered what Rita had been up to that evening- he'd hardly spoken to her since then, up until last night anyway. \"Hey Rit, I never asked- how was Willow the other night? Still a charmin' bundle of sunshine?\" Rita noted how quick Dodger was to change the subject and was determined not to have her concerns brushed aside so easily. She was no fool, and had no intention of being treated like one. Rita shrugged. \"Fine, I guess. Not real friendly, but that's nothin' new. She did mention something about you and me being all over each other, and something along the lines of that 'I shouldn't get sucked in by your charms if I know what's good for me'.\" Rita smirked. \"My sis is not gonna be a happy pup when I tell her about us. You can expect an earful comin' your way.\" \"So you've not been put off me at all?\" Dodger winked. He couldn't help but be a little bit satisfied that he'd been winding Willow up- it was just too easy to push her buttons. \"What do you think?\" Rita laughed and licked his cheek. \"So, are you going to head off to Oliver's soon? The quicker you two patch things up, the quicker you can stop feelin' sorry for yourself.\" \"Geez Rita, I thought I was takin' ya to be my lover, not my mother!\" He playfully nipped at her side, taking the hint, but not being entirely pleased about it. Apparently, romance would have to wait. \"I'm goin', all right?\" \"You know you should,\" Rita said. \"I'm going to head back to the barge, get something to eat. Maybe come back for breakfast with me first? You didn't touch any of that kibble yesterday. And that way I won't be subjected to questioning on my own.\" \"Sounds like a plan, babe.\" Dodger said with a broad grin. Dealing with Oliver could wait just a little while longer. Dodger waited in the bushes outside the Foxworth household later that afternoon. He'd barked a greeting to alert Oliver of his presence and was patiently waiting for the cat to open the front door for him. When he had gone back to the barge with Rita, it had been late enough that everyone had already left for the day. Dodger and Rita had enjoyed a pleasant breakfast lying side by side under one of the new blankets, before finally going their separate ways. Once they'd parted, Dodger felt strangely as though the events of the past day had been a dream that he'd woken from. It was back to reality, and he couldn't put off making peace with Oliver any longer. As he approached the door at the sight of it opening, Dodger saw two familiar faces looking out of the window- Tito and Francis. Well, that explains why they weren't back at the barge. He wondered what Evie would make of these two often-fiery canines; Oliver might have his work cut out for him. The door opened, and Dodger was greeted by his three friends. \"Hey Dodger man, where ya been all night?\" Tito shouted, bounding around Dodger. \"You can't tell me there's nothin' goin' on with you and Rita; you were out with her all night, man!\" Dodger rolled his eyes. Talk about jumping to conclusions! Nonetheless, he had to give Tito this one. Francis raised his eyebrows expectantly as he looked at Dodger. Something about the mutt's expression was very suspicious. Could Tito actually have called it right? \"All right, all right! Yeah, I was with Rita. We had some stuff to sort out. Business, ya know?\" Dodger responded casually. \"...And that is all that the two of you have been up to?\" Francis enquired, not convinced that Dodger was coming clean. Something had happened last night, he was almost certain of it. \"...And we've come to the agreement that we should take our relationship further.\" Tito howled with mirth and fell about laughing. \"I called it, man!\" \"Cool it, Tito.\" Dodger grinned. He knew very well that Tito would be teasing the two of them for a long time to come, but he was happy enough with the new development that it was water off a duck's back. What did he have to be ashamed of, anyway? Being the lover of someone like Rita was hardly something to sniff at. \"Wow, Dodger, that's really cool. You two are going to be great together,\" Oliver said, smiling. It was a relief for him to see Dodger wasn't nearly so grumpy now, and that any hard feelings appeared to have been forgotten. \"Well, it has certainly been a long time coming. I was beginning to wonder if the two of you would ever work it out,\" Francis chuckled. \"Congratulations, Dodger.\" \"Yeah, I know we took a while, but we got there eventually. There's gonna be some very sad ladies around the city, I'm tellin' ya.\" Dodger had noticed that Evie was not practically glued to Oliver's side as she had be the last time he visited. It was a very welcome change in his eyes. \"So, you guys made acquaintance with Oliver's new pal yet?\" \"Young Evangeline?\" Francis asked, \"Why yes, she was right here until a moment ago.\" Oliver beamed proudly. \"She's been really great, hanging out with all of us. She just didn't want to stick around and see who was at the door. I'm sure she'll be back down here soon once she realises it's only you.\" He thought he saw a grimace flash across Dodger's face. Oliver remembered that Rita had been worried about Dodger the night before, had it been something that Evie had done that had caused Dodger such upset? It didn't make a lot of sense to him, but he was determined to find out. Had he been so swept up in his own feelings for Evie that he simply hadn't realised that Dodger actually disliked her? As he watched as Dodger happily caught up with Francis and Tito, Oliver knew that he'd need to somehow get him aside to have a real talk. When Oliver managed to get Dodger by himself some time later, he jumped straight to the point and confronted him about Evie, almost certain that she was the reason behind his odd behaviour. \"Are you sure you're all right with Evie?\" Oliver looked a little sheepish. \"I figured she's what's been bugging you; Rita said you were pretty upset after you were here last, and I can't help feeling that you really don't like her.\" Dodger was surprised and embarrassed that Oliver had picked up on his ill-feeling towards Evie. \"I just overreacted.\" Dodger huffed. \"I hardly see you, and it was like she was the only thing that mattered to you anymore.\" Oliver suddenly felt ashamed. \"I'm sorry for making you feel that way. I guess I just got carried away that night; I really, really like Evie. I mean I like her, and I'm really getting close to her now she's coming out of her shell. I've never had a crush on anyone like this before, and it makes me so nervous and excited, all at the same time. I didn't even realise I was pushing you out- I'd never want to do that. You're like my big brother, Dodger, and that's not ever gonna change.\" Dodger raised an eyebrow. \"Ya know kid, if ya want some help with the ladies, you're pretty fortunate to have The Dodge to look up to. I'll teach ya all the tricks in no time.\" \"Really?\" \"Absitively, kid.\" Dodger grinned his cocky grin. \"But first; do you want some help gettin' your pretty lady friend ready for the big day? Two days isn't long to dog-proof her.\" \"Sure.\" Oliver smiled up at his big brother. \"I think we can do this. Actually, I think if we work together, we can do anything.\" \"Man, you're one sappy little cat,\" Dodger said, and he gave Oliver a playful shove. He needed no more reassurance; nothing and no one would take away their bond of friendship. Truth be told, he rather appreciated Oliver's momentary sappiness. A mighty crash sounded from upstairs, causing both Dodger and Oliver to look up in curiosity. That, thought Oliver, would not do much to keep poor Evie calm. \"Sounds like Tito's having a bit of trouble with The Champ. Come on, kid, we better go and rescue him.\" Dodger laughed. With a heavy weight seemingly lifted off his chest, it now felt as though nothing could bring him down. In the shelter of the barge, Rita lay on her back in a pile of the new blankets in front of the television. After a late night, and with no real need to rush around finding food, she was happy to take it easy. Soon enough, the rest of the gang would start coming home, and in as good a mood as she was, she was excited to see her friends. Einstein, who had missed out on the visit to Oliver because he'd busied himself with gazing longingly at all the holiday displays in shop windows, was first back to the barge. Seeing that Rita was back at home after the night before, he greeted her with a wagging tail and a wide grin. \"Where have you been? Weren't you cold out there all night? You missed a great story; Fagin told us the one about Rudolph and his red nose.\" \"I was out with Dodger; he kept me warm, I kept him warm.\" Rita said, feeling about as happy as Einstein looked. \"We were fine. I hope you were all sheltered from the snow storm.\" \"Oh, that's good. I was a bit worried about you- we were all nice and cosy in here,\" Einstein said. \"Are you and Dodger friends again? I thought maybe you didn't like each other anymore.\" \"Einy, Dodger and I were always friends; we just had a bit of a rough patch. You know how huffy he gets sometimes,\" Rita replied, \"So yes, we're friends, and maybe even more.\" Einstein looked puzzled, and then asked, \"What's more? Is Dodger your boyfriend now?\" \"I guess so, yeah.\" Rita said, feeling her cheeks flush; it felt strange to say it out loud. \"I told him I loved him, and he said he loved me too. We spent the night together,\" she said, a smile coming to her face. \"It was a perfect night, Einstein. I'm happy, and I think Dodge is too.\" \"Are you going to have his puppies?\" Einstein asked excitedly, eyes lit up. By his reckoning, it had been far too long since there were last kids around the barge, and this new partnership of Dodger and Rita could well be promising. Rita's eyes widened in surprise- talk about jumping the gun! The thought of having a litter with Dodger hadn't even entered her head until that moment. \"No, no, no- it's a bit early to be thinkin' of that, this is all new for us. But who knows? Maybe someday we will. There's no need to rush into anything.\" Einstein was a little disappointed, and his ears drooped slightly. \"It's starting to get dark out, do you want to come out with me and see some Christmas lights?\" Rita was keen to cheer Einstein up again, and rather fancied going out for a while after a lazy day. Now that the pressure was off to find enough food to get by, Rita wanted to get out and really enjoy the best parts of the holiday season. The city would be lit up with decorations, and it would all look beautiful in the dark of the late afternoon. \"That sounds like fun!\" Einstein gambolled back up the stairs, with no more encouragement needed. \"What are you waiting for?\" Rita followed a short way behind, stepping out into the cold air, for once with the knowledge that she'd have a genuinely warm and cosy home to return to afterwards. She couldn't remember ever feeling free to just let loose and enjoy the holiday season- not while it was always such a struggle even to survive. This Christmas was be special, that much Rita was sure of. Einstein surged ahead, his long tail wagging in circles like a furry propeller as he and Rita happily headed out into the bustling city, ready to take in the festive atmosphere that reverberated all around.[Chapter 9] Christmas Eve for the gang had always been a big deal, far greater an occasion than the big day itself. Even with the promise of a very special Christmas Day with the Foxworths'- and the first time the gang had been there all together since Jenny's birthday party, tradition was honoured, and the dogs were out late the night before, celebrating together as they always did. Between the hundreds of window displays, the countless lights that glittered all around, the stirring singing of carollers, and, of course, the festive delights of Rockefeller Center; the night was filled with wonder. It was a perfect culmination to a year that had challenged Dodger and his friends in many ways; they'd stared down the threat of Roscoe and DeSoto, welcomed the first feline member to the gang, and Dodger and Rita had found in one another a deeper level of love that they hadn't even known was there. Looking up at the brilliant, sparkling Rockefeller tree, it was impossible to feel anything less than utter contentment. It would be very late before the gang finally made their way back to the barge to rest, but with so much merriment in the air, sleep was hardly a priority. Rita and Dodger were last home; their first Christmas Eve together as partners had been truly magical, and neither had really wanted it to end. Tired or not, Einstein was up and bounding around at the first sign of daybreak the next morning. \"It's Christmas, it's Christmas, it's Christmas!\" he barked, almost falling over his own paws in excitement. Dodger groaned and turned on his side. Perhaps next year he should ask for his gift from Einstein to be a lie in. \"Chill out, man! It's still half dark out!\" he grumbled. His enthusiasm not dampened one iota, Einstein flopped onto Dodger's bed, almost dislodging him, and gave the disgruntled terrier a big, sloppy lick. \"Happy Christmas, Dodger!\" he cried. Fortunately for Einstein, Fagin was also eager to get right into the festivities. \"Morning, boys!\" he called out, and he stretched his long, skinny arms above his head. \"Who wants presents?\" Fagin pulled out a bag from behind his chair, and began pulling out rawhide candy canes- one for each of his canine friends. In no time at all, everyone was up and getting into the spirit of the day. Gift giving had always been a low key affair with the gang, what with their limited resources, but there was never a lack of seasonal goodwill, and tails were wagging all round. It had been several days since Dodger and Rita broke the news that things had changed between them, and the initial obsessive interest of the rest of the gang had waned somewhat, to the relief of the pair. Christmas made for a happy distraction, and the new couple could enjoy one another in relative peace. Still, though, there had been some business to attend to. On Christmas Eve, Dodger had helped Oliver introduce Evie to the lumbering Einstein, ready for the big holiday get together. It had been at first a nerve-wracking experience for the flighty cat, who had never encountered a dog of such massive proportions. In the end, the introduction had gone pretty well and everyone was confident that the Christmas get-together would be a very pleasant experience for all. When they arrived at the grand house late that morning, Fagin and the gang saw Jenny sitting at the window, waiting for them with a cheery looking Oliver sitting on her knees. The ginger cat's whiskers were trembling with anticipation- this was his first Christmas after all, and he had a feeling it would be something he'd remember for many years to come. It wasn't every day he had both his families- the Foxworths, and Fagin's gang- around him all at once. There was much merriment, and a wild game of chase was soon underway. Evie climbed up onto a high shelf, where she could watch with no fear of being trampled. As far as she could tell, this was going to be a very long day. Having grown tougher and more robust as he'd matured, Oliver had developed a fondness for play fighting, and he was very happy to be in the thick of things, roughhousing with his canine friends. Georgette did her best to pretend that none of it was happening, busying herself with keeping Winston on his toes and giving the occasional filthy look to any dog who dared come to near to her with their uncivilised behaviour. This wasn't her idea of a high class Christmas party, and she could only hope that word of such an occasion taking place would not find its way to her many admirers. Admittedly though, seeing the devilish glint in Tito's eye brought back good memories; these dogs were, perhaps, not all bad. If only her Alonso had been of higher class, then who knows what might have come of their whirlwind romance? Christmas lunch was like nothing the gang had ever experienced before- never had they encountered so many glorious smells, all in one place, and all for the taking. Einstein drooled hungrily as he watched the mountains of food get plated up by Winston, who was quick to shoo him out the kitchen. When the great piles of food were put down for everyone to eat, the dogs tucked in with utmost enthusiasm. After the impressive lunch, Mr and Mrs Foxworth phoned to wish Jenny a merry Christmas, and concerned to hear of Fagin going back to the freezing cold barge, offered him a room to stay in for a few days. Winston volunteered to help Fagin to patch the old place up a bit, to make it that much more comfortable through the harsh winter. Fagin was overjoyed and full of gratitude, and excitedly stammered his thanks while roughly shaking the butler's hand. \"Oh, this is going to be so great!\" Oliver said cheerily between bites. \"We can hang out all the time if you're staying here!\" \"It'll be like a vacation- I've never been on a vacation before!\" Einstein exclaimed with a mouth of food. The promise of their home becoming leak-free and cosy, and the thought of staying with good friends in the meantime made for great excitement, even on what had already been a day of high spirits. After lunch, Dodger took the opportunity to take Rita away for a walk in the park. It was a beautiful day after all, and he was happy to take advantage. The sun on the snow made the ground shimmer, and it was quite hard on the eyes initially. \"So, you havin' a good Christmas?\" Dodger asked over the sound of snow crunching beneath his paws. Rita nodded, smiling warmly, \"I can't remember the last time I ate so well. We get to spend time with the kid, I've got you with me,\" she bumped her head against his, \"pretty close to a perfect day.\" They came to a bridge, and Dodger sat atop it, his forepaws resting on a railing. He looked over at Rita; there was a great happiness in her eyes as she stared back at him. The past few days had been strange as they both adjusted to the change in their relationship. Neither of them were completely sure where they'd be going with it all, having not really talked it out. There was still that constant worrisome niggle in the back of Dodger's mind; that no matter what he felt for Rita, sooner or later temptation would get the better of him elsewhere. And then what? If he and Rita had a major fall out, they would not be the only ones affected. This whole thing was a massive gamble. But, Dodger told himself, he loved her so much, and she loved him. That might just be enough. He looked away and stared into the distance and rubbed his head against hers as she moved close to him. \"Rita? D'you think this is gonna work?\" Dodger asked quietly, finally voicing the fear that had troubled him for days. Rita's smile faltered. \"I hope so. You and I have been through enough together that we can make it work. Maybe we should just keep this relaxed, and see how it goes?\" \"I don't want to slow down, this has been great. I've never felt this way about anyone. I just don't want to hurt you, but a part of me is sure I'm going to.\" Dodger nuzzled Rita's face. \"Don't worry about me, I know what I'm getting into. I'm not stupid enough to think you got your reputation for no reason- and I've not exactly been good at long-term relationships either, but in the end it doesn't really matter. I trust you. And if it ends up that you need a bit on the side every now and then, I know it wouldn't mean anything and I'd get over it. As long as you're putting us first and being there for me when I need you, I can take it. I want to be with you, and only you, Dodge, it's simple as that.\" Rita spoke with a fierceness that made it clear that she meant every word. She loved Dodger, and if when it came down to it, monogamy just didn't work for him, she'd love him all the same. She knew how much she meant to him, and that was enough… more than enough. Dodger found himself smiling. \"I want to be with you too. You're my rock, and you always have been.\" \"Even if this doesn't work out, you are first and foremost my best friend. Nothing's gonna change that, not ever.\" \"In that case,\" Dodger said, getting down from the railing so he could face her, \"let's do this- make it official. Will ya be my mate, Rita? Till death us do part and all that?\" Rita beamed her response. \"Absitively posolutely.\" Dodger laughed and kissed her. For a few minutes more they sat together enjoying the sunshine, before heading back to the Foxworth's to re-join the party. It had been decided- as Winston not particularly enamoured by the smell of several dirty street dogs- that Fagin's dogs should be bathed if they were to be staying for a few days. Seeing as he'd have to face enforced cleanliness anyway, Tito reluctantly allowed Georgette to work her magic. Winston and Fagin took Francis and Einstein to the biggest bathroom, thinking that to thoroughly wash Einstein would be a two person job. Winston had become rather fond of Francis, despite their earlier run-ins, and the bulldog was his first choice when given the option of which dog to give a spruce up. Fagin figured that neither Dodger nor Rita should be too much trouble, so their grooming was entrusted to a very eager Jenny, who led them to her own private bathroom. Even as she heard the crashes and splashes of Einstein struggling against his bath, Rita quietly enjoyed the rare pampering. The whole experience was rather relaxing and she was already feeling refreshed. Every now and then, Oliver and Dodger would pop their heads around the door though would both be quick to retreat if ever it looked like Jenny was about to come for them and place them in the tub alongside Rita. \"You'll get your turn Dodge.\" Rita called to him. Dodger could be such a child when it came to cleanliness, but really he was missing out. After the enjoyment- or trauma, depending on your point of view- of bath time, Dodger, Rita and Oliver lay on Jenny's bed as she went through the finishing touches of the grooming session. Rita rolled contentedly onto her side as Jenny brushed her newly blow-dried fur. It was all very soothing. Dodger and Oliver were still mucking around, rolling around on the bed in play. The shy and quiet Evie had joined them in Jenny's room, and watched from the floor, jumping a little whenever her friends got too boisterous. How strange, thought Evie, that Oliver is happy to roughhouse with a dog like that, and one from the streets no less. Even after several weeks, she still found the relationship between Oliver and Dodger to be somewhat bizarre, and it intrigued her greatly. With so many dogs running around, she had been keeping herself away from the action, and Oliver had taken the opportunity to really catch up with Dodger properly. \"You all right there, Evie?\" Rita asked, having been watching the young cat through half-closed eyes. \"I can get them to knock it off if it's getting too much for you.\" Evie smiled shyly, and opened her mouth to speak just as Einstein bounded into the room, still wet from his bath and sending toys flying in his enthusiasm. Overwhelmed, Evie scuttled into the hallway, where she was passed by a newly-clean Francis. Rita frowned, but decided to wait a little while before checking in with the nervous young cat. If she was overwhelmed now, having a dog following after was unlikely to help. It couldn't be easy for poor Evie to feel at ease while everyone was so over-excited. Rita moved to the head of the bed- with all the sudden activity her pampering session was clearly over- and rolled onto her back amongst the pillows. \"Where's Tito?\" Rita asked, stretching her neck to towards Francis who was watching the goings-on from the floor. \"It appears that Tito has once again become rather enamoured with young Oliver's glamorous friend.\" Francis sighed. \"I don't imagine we'll be seeing much of him this evening.\" Dodger laughed. \"What, again? It'll last two weeks at best!\" \"I dunno, he must like her a lot if he's letting her give him a bath. Baths are horrible.\" Einstein said, pausing from his attack on Jenny's pillow. \"He would've got a bath anyway. It's hardly a great act of devotion.\" Rita smirked. \"It's good though, it means Tito's gonna come and visit us here more often!\" Oliver said excitedly from on top of Dodger's back. \"Yeah, for maybe a week or two!\" Dodger grinned. The relationship between Georgette and Tito had always been volatile, and it was only a matter of time before it was all change again. Dodger suspected, though, that the fiery Tito liked it that way. While her friends occupied themselves with tussling on the bed, Rita slipped away to seek out Evie. The poor kid sure looked overwhelmed, and she wanted to check in with some support. Coming down the stairs, Rita found Evie lying on a plumped up cushion in front of the window, looking out onto the snowy streets. \"Are you feeling okay, honey?\" Rita asked kindly. \"If you want to be left alone, I get it, but I thought you might like to hang out for a bit- away from the chaos.\" Evie had instinctively stiffened at the sight of even a friendly dog approaching her, but she quickly regained a calm composure. In her experience, Rita was good-natured and understanding. \"I'm fine, I guess. It was just getting a bit loud up there,\" she said, \"and Einstein still makes me a little nervous.\" \"Fair enough, he's a lotta dog.\" Evie smiled. \"That's for sure,\" she said, feeling more comfortable. \"It would be nice to have someone to talk to, if you don't mind- I know you'd probably have more fun upstairs with the others.\" \"Evie, it's a pleasure,\" Rita said with a wag of her tail. \"You've always been nice to me, and I really appreciate that. It's just been so hard to stop thinking about everything that happened before… I want to be able to trust you all like Oliver does, but I don't really know how.\" Rita lay down on the rug, feeling that Evie would be more comfortable sitting above her. \"You should be proud; you've come along way already.\" She paused, studying the shy cat's face. \"If you don't mind me asking- and I understand if you don't want to talk about it- but what happened for you to get wound up with a dog like Flint?\" Evie shifted anxiously and took a little while to respond. She wanted to talk, knowing that she was with an understanding friend, but those memories haunted her and were very painful. Rita made no attempt to hurry her along, which Evie appreciated. \"I was left behind… I had humans before, but they left. Said they were going somewhere that they couldn't take me.\" She kneaded the pillow with her paws as she spoke, the fidgeting making it easier somehow. \"I- I wandered around on my own for a long time, and then I ran into him. Flint.\" Evie swallowed uncomfortably. \"He told me that he could make sure I was fed, find me safe places to sleep at night… he seemed nice enough so I went with him. He took me back to a junkyard where his gang had been staying round that time; there were a lot of dogs- at least five others and all real big. I was scared, but Flint said he needed someone like me and he'd protect me in return. I couldn't run away then, there were too many dogs, I'd have been caught in an instant and torn to pieces.\" \"Are you okay?\" Rita asked gently as Evie fell quiet. Perhaps she was asking too much of the traumatised cat. Evie nodded, but took a moment before she continued talking. She wanted to move on from her past, and it seemed the best way to do that was to share with someone who might understand. \"Flint showed me a sheltered place to sleep… but I couldn't sleep until I knew none of those dogs were awake, I couldn't trust them. I knew I'd made a mistake in going with him, I could feel it. Next day he told me what he wanted from me. See, they'd had some trouble with another dog gang, old Flint had some history with the leader. He wanted me to spy on them, 'cause I was small and quiet and agile. I didn't really have a choice by this point, so I went along with it.\" She continued on. \"So I went after these other dogs, following them. I was so scared they'd find me- they came close one time, one of them caught my scent and would have had me if a car alarm hadn't spooked him. I didn't think I could risk it again so I went back to Flint, told him that I appreciated his offer but I couldn't keep it up. He waited until I turned to walk away then he grabbed me. He held me tight in his jaws, squeezing tight so I was gasping to breathe… he shook me up above his head like I was just some little toy.\" Evie's voice quivered and she closed her eyes tight. \"I thought I was going to die for sure. He threw me in the air and I was caught by another dog, and then they just passed me around, laughing. Finally they just let me fall. Flint came up close and asked me if I'd changed my mind about leaving or if I needed more convincing. I was too scared to move, even to nod, but I managed to say 'yes'. I crawled back to my sleeping space and stayed there all night. The next day I went spying on those other dogs; I came back to Flint with information to try and reassure him that I wouldn't make a break for it, but when I went out a second time I just ran. I jumped into the back of a garbage truck and hid. I guessed it would be harder for them to track me that way, and I couldn't have run far anyway; I was so sore, all bruised from what they'd done to me. When I was a long way away I jumped out… it was a few days before Mr Foxworth found me, and I hardly ate in that time. I don't know what I would have done if they didn't take me in… I was starving.\" Rita was sympathetic. It was small wonder Evie didn't trust dogs. \"You poor kid,\" she said kindly. \"You know, it took a lot of guts for you to make a run for it like you did- you should be proud.\" Evie gave a weak smile. \"Thank you, Rita.\" \"If there's anything I can do to help you out, Oliver knows where to find me. I'll always be there if you need to talk, or if you need help with Georgette. Most dogs aren't like Flint, honey. You just got unlucky. But your luck's changed, and you're gonna be just fine- Ollie's gonna make sure of that, and Jenny. Just hang in there.\" Sensing Evie's trust, Rita got to her feet and gently licked the cat's forehead. Evie purred. She was certain now, that she'd made a true friend in this tough but kind hearted dog. If that wasn't a big step in facing her fears, then she didn't know what would be. All too soon, it was time for bed- while the dogs and Oliver could easily have stayed up much later having fun together, Winston wanted Jenny to get some sleep, and everyone else followed suit. Fagin had been offered a very comfortable room to sleep in, and very quickly he found himself sharing his bed with Einstein, Francis, and Tito, who'd finally come scurrying from Georgette's grand bedroom. \"Hey, Dodge, do you want to stay with me and Evie in Jenny's room?\" Oliver asked cheerfully as he climbed up the stairs. It mattered to him that Dodger felt as though he truly valued their friendship, and the young cat had promised himself to make sure not to let go of that. \"You can sleep on the bed- Jenny won't mind.\" He turned to Rita. \"You can stay there as well, I'm sure there will be enough room.\" \"Thanks kid.\" Rita smiled. \"I think I'll spend the night with the others though, it wouldn't be fair on Evie to have two dogs around all night. I'm sure she'll be fine with Dodger, but best not to push it, right? She's a sweet kid, and she's been amazing today. I think Evie deserves a peaceful night's sleep- must be exhausting being on alert all the time.\" Oliver nodded thoughtfully, appreciating his friend's consideration for the most sensitive member of the household. \"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow then.\" He rubbed himself around Rita's legs before trotting off towards Jenny's room. \"You coming, Dodger?\" \"Right behind ya, kid.\" Dodger called after him. \"I'll just be a moment, all right?\" \"Sure!\" Oliver pushed his way through the door to 'his' bedroom. Finally, Dodger and Rita were alone in the hallway. \"You're sure you're cool with me sleepin' in the other room?\" Dodger asked. It was still early days for them as a couple, and quality time spent together was important. More than that, he was determined to show her that he was truly serious about where they were going. \"I'm sure I can survive one night without you close by, I'm not a pup you know.\" Rita smirked, quietly appreciating Dodger's concern for her feelings- unnecessary though it was in this instance. \"Dodge, you've gotta make the most of the time you've got with the kid. Oliver's growing up, and things are gonna change between you and him. I don't want to see the two of you drifting apart.\" Dodger sighed. \"Yeah, I guess that's true. I'll just have to try and see him through all the changes. Thanks, Rit.\" He yawned, reaching forward in a stretch, and glanced upwards at the mistletoe above their heads. \"So… this mistletoe thing, you want to try it out?\" He smirked, cocky as always. Rita smiled flirtatiously, and hooked her paw in Dodger's bandanna, pulling him into a long, loving kiss. \"That work all right for you?\" she asked as they parted. \"Definitely no complaints from me,\" Dodger said with a broad grin. \"Happy Christmas,\" he added quietly, looking back at Rita as he headed to Jenny's room, the usual smugness absent from his voice. \"You too.\" Rita responded gently, and with a look of great tenderness towards her mate, she left to join the others in the room that Fagin was staying in. She jumped up and gave her master a lick on the face before settling down at the foot of the bed. Even with the sound of Francis snoring noisily, and the damp on the quilt from Einstein's drooling in his sleep, Rita was happy. She sighed in contentment and closed her eyes, ready to drift away. Surely, no dog could ask for a happier Christmas.[Chapter 10] A new year rolled in, and while Fagin and Winston busied themselves with making the barge more habitable and winter-proof, Dodger and the gang enjoyed coming back to the Foxworths' warm and comfortable home each night. With their bellies kept full with rich food, both Rita and Einstein had lost the 'ribby' look and were brighter within themselves. It was as though spring had come early, and all were grateful for the generosity of Jenny's family. Rita sniffed at her breakfast bowl, taking in wafts of what she'd been offered… today it was three fat sausages. It seemed unbelievable to her that she'd been given such a thing as breakfast all, and it was hard not to feel that the gang was taking advantage of Winston's good nature. Still, though, the butler seemed happy to have more mouths to cook for. Rita tucked in, savouring the delicious taste, but leaving one of the sausages untouched. Einstein, his head resting and the floor, found himself salivating. \"Can I have it if you're full? I always have room.\" He inched nearer, crawling forward on his belly and leaving a trail of slobber on the tiles. \"Don't get excited,\" Rita said, \"I'm taking this one to Willow. She's not lucky enough to have anyone else looking out for her.\" Einstein lifted his head and looked at Rita curiously. Willow had always been a confusing individual to him; she seemed like she simply didn't want friends. \"It's sad she doesn't want to stay with us; Fagin would treat her good. Does she really want to be all alone? She can't be happy.\" Rita shrugged and sighed. Most of the gang had no interest in building friendships with the prickly Willow, but Einstein, good-hearted as he was, had made several valiant attempts to connect with her. Perhaps he saw her as extended family, or, Rita thought, he remembered back to when she and Willow were pups, and how much she'd missed her. \"I don't think she's been happy since she was a kid,\" Rita said sadly. \"She doesn't have much reason to trust anyone, I guess.\" \"She probably needs the sausage more than me,\" said Einstein, and he wagged his tail. \"Sausages are good for cheering a dog up.\" \"Well, it can't hurt,\" Rita said, smiling just a little. Einstein was a good guy. As Rita picked up the sausage and made to walk toward the door, the Great Dane pulled himself to his feet and ran after her. He mouthed at her neck, growling, trying to incite a play fight. Since the gang had temporarily moved in with the Foxworths, play had been frequent and vigorous- a result of the new health and security they felt in the sheltered environment. In this instance though, Einstein had chosen the wrong target, and Rita just shook him off. \"Einy!\" Rita grumbled, her voice muffled by Willow's breakfast in her mouth. \"Get off.\" She dodged underneath him, and he collapsed down, rolling on the floor. Skipping over Einstein's writhing form, she turned back to him with a cockeyed smile. \"Later, okay?\" When Rita stepped outside, the cold was biting. It was tempting to retreat back to the warmth and comfort of the house, but as she'd said, Willow didn't really have anyone else. Many months ago, Rita had taken a step back, encouraging her sister to form bonds with the dogs she lived alongside, but they remained acquaintances at best. Willow was closed off, and Rita knew there was little she could do to change that. The occasional gift of food- though Willow would never accept anything stolen- was the least she could do. In truth, Rita had been avoiding an encounter with her sister since taking Dodger as a mate, knowing that a confrontation over the matter was highly likely. Having swung by the barge to pick up a blanket to offer to Willow, Rita arrived at the old warehouse. The place was heaving with dogs. There were only ten 'regulars', including Willow, who resided at the warehouse hangout full time, but with the foul weather, street dogs had come from all around to find shelter, warmth in numbers, and allies with whom to share resources. Aggression between rival street dogs was rampant when the temperatures dropped, so a place where none of this was accepted was highly sought after. Immediately, Rita was greeted by an acquaintance, a boxer by the name of Tango, who was one of the warehouse's permanent residents. \"Hey, human-licker,\" Tango barked. \"How's it hangin'? Keepin' warm?\" Rita nudged her head against Tango's in polite greeting. \"I'm doin' all right. It looks like all five of us will come through this winter in one piece… no one's been badly sick so far.\" \"Well, ya can't ask for more than that. You're gonna be wantin' Willow, aren't ya?\" Tango eyed the sausage that Rita had placed on the floor. If Willow turned out to be too proud to take a gift, she'd happily take it off Rita's paws. \"Yeah, I gotta make sure she's doin' okay. Last time I was here we had an argument-\" \"Again? You know what, chick? You two might be better off cuttin' your losses. Some dogs just aren't meant to get along.\" Rita gave a sad smile. \"But who does get along with her? I mean, really? Girl's gotta know I'm at least tryin'. I owe her that much.\" \"We try, ya know,\" Tango said defensively, \"but it's like she's goin' through the motions. Every time any of us start getting close to her, she shuts it down and we're back to square one. Sly's even tried to ask her out- you know, on a date. She just don't wanna know anyone.\" \"Sly? I thought he was more interested in Babe.\" Tango barked a laugh. \"Guess there's only so many knock backs a dog can take. Anyway, Willow's probably out the back. You know she hates it when it gets busy round here. She'll be off sulkin' somewhere.\" Willow was indeed out around the back of the building, curled up tight in an old overturned trash can. Though she'd been staring into space, lost in her own thoughts, she snapped to the present the moment Rita came around the side of the warehouse. She nervously wagged her tail; it had not been on good terms that she'd last left her sister. \"I thought you might appreciate some extra sustenance,\" Rita said, and she nudged the sausage towards Willow, who avoided eye contact. She pulled the blanket off her back and laid it down in front of her. \"And some extra warmth. Are you all right?\" \"I'm alive, aren't I? About as good as it gets.\" Willow glanced behind Rita, almost expecting Dodger to be coming around the corner. \"Is it just you?\" Rita stifled a groan. This wasn't a good sign for the conversation to come. \"He's not with me; he's runnin' round somewhere with the cat probably.\" Reassured that she wouldn't be sharing her sister's attention, Willow was quickly up and tucking into the sausages. With breakfast eaten and pleasantries exchanged, the two hounds set off into the city. For Willow, long jaunts away from the docks were almost unheard of; the hustle and bustle of city like was all too much for her if she didn't have someone to rely on in the case of a sticky situation. With Rita by her side, the streets could be explored with little threat from other dogs- there was definitely safety in numbers. While Willow trotted along with her head and tail held low, Rita bounced through the snowy streets with the playfulness that had come out in the whole gang. She nipped gaily at Willow's tail, which was met only with irritated snaps. \"Cut it out, will you? I'm not sure what you're so happy about… it looks like it's gonna snow again.\" Willow's attitude was in stark contrast to Einstein's earlier eagerness for frivolity. Rita was undeterred; well aware that no one else would make the effort to bring out her sister's well-hidden sense of fun. \"You've got a blanket, you've got a full belly- just unwind a little, won't you,\" she said, dropping into a play bow. \"It won't hurt, I promise.\" Reluctantly, Willow nipped Rita's shoulder, signalling that she'd go along with this nonsense, at least for a moment. Seeing the broad smile that came to her sister's face, Willow couldn't fight the new and growing urge to make playful contact. \"Come on, Willie,\" Rita pressed her, \"run with me.\" She surged forward, trusting that Willow simply wouldn't be able to resist; dogs of their kind could rarely turn down an invitation to run and chase. Even as they played though, Willow's movements were stilted, as though she was forcing the matter. While Rita rolled over her back in the snow, Willow remained uptight. She wouldn't allow herself to truly become drawn in. Rita was frustrated. Something just wasn't clicking with Willow, and she was at a loss as to how to overcome it. Giving up on any level of frivolity- fun would just have to wait until she was back with the gang, at least Einstein was keen- she opted instead just to have a leisurely stroll along the streets with her sister. Relieved that the uncomfortable feeling that came with trying to play had dissipated, Willow quietly walked by Rita's side. There wasn't a lot she could think to say; conversation was not her strong point, and it would be all too easy to pick a fight as they were completely different in their ways of seeing the world. \"So, what's the gossip round the warehouse? Not much that gets past you.\" Rita gave Willow a kind nudge. \"Uh, I've been outta the thick of it; it gets so crowded this time of year,\" Willow said. \"Murphy's gettin' old, so it's more Athena taking charge these days. You probably already know that Pink and Midnight got together; I think they're gonna try for a litter soon.\" \"Must be a while since there's been any puppies round that place- living there I mean.\" \"Not since I moved in,\" Willow said. \"It's a bit early for anyone to get excited, but I know Athena's hopeful. She likes puppies.\" \"What about you, fancy taking on pupsitting?\" Rita asked, fairly confident she knew what the response would be. Willow tossed her ears. \"Certainly not! If that fluffball wants to get herself pregnant, the results are her problem to deal with. There's gonna be plenty of others wanting in on it all anyway, no need for me to get involved.\" Rita rolled her eyes. Close contact with her extended 'family' for want of a better word was definitely still a stumbling block for Willow. \"Has Blizzard shown up round the place yet?\" she asked, remembering that one of the warehouse regulars had disappeared mysteriously a while back. \"It's gotta be a few months now.\" Willow just shrugged. \"Not that I know of,\" she said with an air of disinterest. \"Winter seems convinced he's got caught up with Flint's lot; he reckons that Lab girl he was hooking up with was involved with them. Not sure how Flint would like some kid sniffin' round one of his women- maybe the idiot got smart and ran off before he got in too deep. I dunno. I never really talked to him or Winter; they're a pair of morons, almost as charming as your precious Dodger.\" Again, Flint. Everything Rita heard confirmed that he was an extremely dangerous dog, and it made her quite relieved that the nervous Evie was happy enough staying in the safety of her Fifth Avenue home. Young Blizzard had been an arrogant idiot, but he certainly didn't deserve to lose his life to nutters like that. Rita quietly hoped he would indeed have had the sense to lie low as soon as he knew Flint was involved. More pressingly though, the conversation had turned to Dodger, and there was news to be shared… news that Willow would not take well. Rita took a moment before speaking. \"Will, you're not gonna like this,\" she started, \"but it's better you hear it from me.\" She could feel Willow become tense beside her. \"Dodger's my mate now. It happened just before Christmas. I know you think it's a mistake, but I'm happy- we both are.\" Willow's face screwed up in disgust. \"You're pathetic!\" she said, scowling. \"If you had any self-respect at all…\" \"Look, I don't expect you to like this, but it's my life. I'm not fool enough to not realise that he's a womaniser, but sometimes that's not what matters. Dodger loves me, I love him; simple. Anything more than that is none of your business.\" \"I'm actually surprised it took him this long to get on top of you. Living round here, there's a lot of dirt being dished out, and your smarmy creep features in a lot of it.\" \"It's not your place to pass judgement, Willow,\" Rita growled. \"I'm a grown woman, and I can be romantically involved with whoever I like. And even if Dodge and I were still just friends, you still gotta grow up and get over it.\" Willow's fur bristled. \"How am I meant to get over it?\" she spat. \"You've been falling at his paws ever since you were a kid. He changed you! He made you leave us- he made you leave me . If you're stupid enough that you trust a dog like Dodger, you deserve what's coming, and it ain't gonna be pretty.\" \" Willow ! I've had about enough of dealing with your garbage. This isn't about you, so quit playing the victim. When you get yourself a successful relationship, then I might ask you for advice.\" With a look of intense venom, Willow turned and stormed off. She stopped and turned back. \"Well, I don't need your help either! You can keep your pity offerings; I can take care of myself.\" \"Glad to hear it; guess you won't need me at all. I'll catch you round, Willie, or maybe not.\" Rita watched as Willow flounced away. It hurt; it hurt deeply. She felt powerless, unable to build the bridge between the people she cared about. When it came down to it though, Dodger and the rest of the gang actually cared about her in return. It would take time for Willow to calm down, Rita knew that much; she'd taken the development as a personal betrayal. After many months of trying to reach her, she still couldn't understand Willow, who remained damaged. There was nothing to do but give her space, but Rita grew weary of treading on eggshells whenever they did interact. When it came to family, it felt better for her to stick to the one she chose for herself. Rita stumbled in the front door, welcomed into the Foxworth home by a jovial Oliver. The young cat had been having the time of his life- with Jenny and Evie, and Dodger and the gang around the place, he rarely had a moment that he wasn't having fun with someone. \"Hey, Rita!\" Oliver cried, \"Nice morning? You must be freezing!\" He affectionately wove between her legs, rubbing against her cold, damp legs. It had been snowing for the past hour; not soft fluffy snow, but harsh icy shards. With no need to find food, and with most of the gang enjoying the luxuries indoors, it hadn't seemed worth continuing to shiver out in the cold once Willow had walked off. \"I wouldn't say nice,\" Rita replied, pleasantly, \"but it makes it all the better to see you.\" She stretched out her tired body, taking in the scents of the warm home; it smelt like Winston was cooking something for lunch. In the front room, Francis had joined Georgette in her exercise routine in front of the television, apparently working on his New Year's resolution to get fitter, while Tito sniggered into a pillow on the window seat. Rita had to stifle a giggle herself. \"You know you've got the park literally on the other side of the road, right?\" Rita asked, failing to see the point in their awkward prancing and posing. \"Ain't it easier just to go for a run?\" \"In the snow? You must be joking,\" Georgette scoffed. \"As if I'd go out and let my fur get like yours.\" She sneered at Rita's windswept look. There was no way on earth she'd go out in public like that. Rita jumped up and lay down beside Tito, who continued to chortle. \"Hey, Dodger, man!\" Tito shouted, \"Wifey's back!\" Not particularly happy about being addressed as such, Rita nonetheless bit her tongue; he'd had quite enough confrontation for one day. Dodger sauntered in with his usual swagger, and Einstein at his heels. Something in the mutt's rough face lit up as he saw his mate, and it raised Rita's own spirits. Einstein, in contrast, did not look cheerful. \"What's up, old man?\" Rita asked. \"Looks like you lost the wag from your tail, hon.\" \"Poor idiot,\" Dodger replied on Einstein's behalf, and he jumped up between Rita and Tito. \"Spent all morning bouncin' Jenny's basketball everywhere we went- thought he was gonna chew a hole in it- then musta smelt somethin' cookin' 'cause he put it down and lost it.\" Einstein's ears drooped. \"I'm a bad friend,\" he said miserably. \"Jenny's gonna be so sad.\" \"Aw, she'll live,\" Oliver said reassuringly. \"She's got so many toys she probably won't even notice.\" \"Einstein,\" Rita said, shaking her head, \"you'd lose your own tail if it wasn't screwed into your bony rump. We'll just have to find her something to replace it.\" She felt her body relax as Dodger began grooming her, dislodging bits of snow from her fur. \"Don't feel too bad; I'll play with you in a little while- at least I know you appreciate the gesture.\" Einstein furrowed his brow, slowly remembering where Rita had gone that morning. \"Did Willow not want to play? Wait- did she not want her sausage?\" He groaned; extra breakfast would not have gone unappreciated with him around. This just wasn't his day! \"Let's just say, I won't feel the need to give her handouts in the future.\" Dodger looked up, suspecting what had happened. \"You okay, babe? Don't worry about her- ya know she's messed up. Nothin' personal, just her.\" \"If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it right now.\" Rita made eye contact with Dodger. He was obviously trying to make her feel better, but it wasn't working. In that moment, surrounded by the family that actually did genuinely care about her, she just wanted to forget about it and hang out- it wouldn't be long before they'd be saying goodbye to Jenny and the Foxworths, so this time was best made the most of. Dodger got the message. He briefly nuzzled her cheek, just to reaffirm that he was there for her if she needed him. \"'Course not,\" he said, smirking, \"life's too short to waste yappin' over hopeless causes. Besides, don't wanna miss any of Francis' earth-shatterin' dance moves.\" He winked as the bulldog gave him a scandalised look. \"I'll have you know that this exercise regime has several celebrity endorsements that shower it with praise!\" Francis pronounced huffily. Oliver bounded after, joining in enthusiastic and quickly getting right under Georgette's feet. \"I gotta admit, it's pretty fun. And we always eat candy afterwards as a reward!\" Rita again caught Dodger's eye, smirking. That sounded like Francis' idea of fitness. She relaxed her weary muscles, feeling the warmth from her mate against her side. Poor Willow really didn't know what she was missing… Dodger was right, your pals really were all you needed.[Chapter 11] Rita closed her eyes happily as Dodger caressed her muzzle with his, and returned the gesture. It was late at night, and deep in the park, there was quiet and rare solitude- save, of course, for one another. The snow on the ground was now patchy, leaving damp grass and cold, bare earth; and the lake remained frozen around the edges. It was here, overlooking the vast expanse of water, that the two dogs had laid down in snow, beneath the skeleton of a large tree. It could be perceived as a rather bleak outlook, but in a world of concrete and steel, it had its beauty. For Dodger and Rita, it made a romantic destination for a night out; the harshness of winter in the city did not faze them. Large though the Foxworth house was, few places in there felt private . Most nights, Dodger would talk with Oliver until they both fell asleep, taking advantage of the opportunity to spend time with him as a brother. If he did leave to meet with Rita late at night, she'd not been keen on the idea of sneaking around the house- they were guests after all. During the day, there were dogs and cats coming and going all over the place, so it was hardly conducive for some alone time. Out here it was cold, and it was damp, but it was hard for enthusiasm to be dampened when passion was running so high. The two had roamed far, taking in the sights of the park side by side, punctuated by romantic interludes before settling in this quiet spot for a blissful hour. Of course, Central Park could be a dangerous place in the dead of night; it was near empty, but anyone encountered was unlikely to be good news. Dodger and Rita had needed to side-step a gang of human youths who were drinking and smoking under a bridge. Both dogs knew better than to go to close to teenage humans at this time of night; often the testosterone charged adolescents brandished weapons, and this coupled by their erratic behaviour made them best avoided… even if they did smell to have food on them. Here though, there was no one in earshot, adolescent human or otherwise. Rita and Dodger were alone, and revelling in it. Dodger reclined on his side with a lopsided grin, pleased with himself. \"Will you quit smirkin' at me?\" Rita grumbled, holding back a smile of her own. She lay down her head against his chest, and just the feel of him was blissful. \"Impressive though that was, you wanna watch you don't get too conceited. It ain't a good look, honey.\" \"Tha's what they all say, baby,\" Dodger said, grinning all the more, \"but ya know they keep comin' back.\" He wriggled a little closer, and rested his head on Rita's shoulder. Her fur was soft; regular grooming by an eager Jenny had kept her coat in wonderful condition ever since her bath at Christmas. Dodger closed his eyes and took Rita's feel, her scent, even the little sounds coming from her belly. Such intimacy was still new to him; for years he'd made a point of staying detached whenever getting close to women, but he no longer felt uneasy, just happy to feel a deep connection with Rita. \"Don't matter anyhow, as long as you're not plannin' on goin' off me.\" Rita smiled in contentment. \"Well, I don't think you've got anything to worry about,\" she said. \"I'm pretty happy if you are.\" The sound of barking rang across the water, causing Rita to lift her head. The calls became fierce, putting her on edge. Park dogs were numerous, but most would not be active in the dead of night, even with the lack of human presence to draw them out. Dodger looked up. \"Someone's in trouble,\" he said, unconcerned. He went to put his head back down against Rita, but she was already getting to her feet, alert. Listening to the voices on the wind, Rita was tense. She had no real reason to be nervous; even if there were aggressive dogs nearby, she and Dodger were perfectly capable of steering clear of trouble, but she paid attention nonetheless, knowing that the last thing they wanted would be to get taken by surprise by unfriendly strangers. \"Relax, babe,\" Dodger reassured, \"they're not gonna bother us- probably on the other side of the water.\" Rita walked up over a fallen tree, using it as a vantage point to look out past the water. The bare trees and bushes hid little, but she saw no dogs. Perhaps the voices were echoing around the bare landscape. \"I know,\" she said calmly. \"but it sounds serious, whatever's goin' on out there. I'd feel better knowing where those dogs are, whoever they are.\" The ferocious barking faded into the distance, and Rita looked back to Dodger, whose eyes were alight with the strength of his feeling for her. It was just a few weeks ago that she'd felt self-conscious around him, all too aware that she'd looked about as ill as she'd felt. After getting back to a healthy weight, Rita was more comfortable within herself, even knowing that Dodger wanted her just as much either way. She now felt attractive again, perhaps, she thought, because she felt generally healthier since the gang took refuge with Jenny's family. It was the break from the harsh realities of winter on the streets that they'd all needed. A wind was now beginning to pick up, and the comfortable house once again was inviting. Rita strutted back down to Dodger, swishing her tail seductively. \"Nothing left to disturb us,\" Rita whispered by her mate's ear. \"We should start back,\" she paused to give Dodger a lingering kiss. \"…we can take our time.\" She grinned flirtatiously, her eyes locked on his, knowing that he'd receive the message loud and clear. Dodger responded enthusiastically, kissing her with fervour. He looked deep into her dark eyes, which twinkled with the light that bounced off the snowy earth. It was hours before sun up, and the park was theirs to enjoy. They'd get back to Jenny's, but only by taking the long road peppered with intimate moments. \"We'll take all the time ya need, Rit,\" he said, coming away but not taking his gaze from her face, \"I'm in no hurry.\" When Dodger woke the next morning, curled up at the end of Jenny's bed as per the norm, Oliver was right by his side, purring. He smiled. Right now, it felt as though he had absolutely everything. It was all about to change- with the barge fixed up and given some much-needed added comfort, Fagin would be taking the dogs back- but Dodger felt secure in where he was with his little ginger cat brother. As long as he didn't give up on Oliver, he knew that Oliver would never give up on him. The sort of tie they shared could not be broken by distance, and Dodger knew would never let his buddy down. He closed his eyes again, hopeful that he'd be allowed a lie in… just this once. Oliver lay awake, happy to feel his friend right there next to him. For the past weeks, he'd enjoyed the best of both worlds; sharing his home with both Jenny and the gang. It was almost too good to be true, and now it was coming to its inevitable end. The house had been buzzing with dogs, and though it had been a challenge to keep the experience comfortable for Evie, it had been an absolute joy. Even Georgette, despite her frequent and loud complaints, seemed to at very least appreciate having Tito around, and it had brought Oliver closer to her- perhaps because he was no longer the person she liked least in the household. Each day was filled with laughter and shenanigans- how could it not with five street dogs taking up residence? Oliver dreaded to think how quiet and still the house would become in just a matter of hours. In his heart, he'd always been part of the gang, but this time had deepened that connection immeasurably. It felt as though this was the way it was meant to be, but in the end, they remained worlds apart, however much he might wish otherwise. He edged closer to Dodger, and wished once more for things to stay this way. As per what had become the norm, there was a morning buzz around the house as everyone rose and clamoured around the kitchen for breakfast. Francis and Einstein stood in the doorway with eyes wide and tails wagging as they watched Winston prepare bacon omelettes. While the butler did not usually go so all out with feeding the Foxworths' own pets, he was keen to do his bit to keep some healthy weight on Fagin's lot. The dogs were certainly not complaining. Einstein in particular was keen; he'd missed dinner the night before, having arrived back at the house late. It hadn't been on purpose; for a third time, he'd completely forgotten that the gang were staying there, and he'd waited around the empty barge for hours before it finally clicked. The old Dane made a conscious choice not to mention this to his friends, allowing them to assume he'd just been out having fun in the park. He was used to being teased by his friends about being 'a bit dumb', and Francis could be especially mean towards him. Einstein never took it too much to heart, for he knew they loved him really, but was embarrassed enough by his mistakes to keep it to himself. Rita was slow to rise; having been up for most of the night with her Dodger. She padded into the kitchen just as the bowls were placed on the floor, and joined her friends. While Einstein, Francis and Tito inhaled their food, she took her time, savouring the substantial meal- one that would not be replicated once they went back to the barge. As Dodger came into the room, Rita exchanged a glance with him and smiled. \"You musta been comfortable, hon, almost missed breakfast.\" \"Hey, Rita, I time my entrance perfectly. Ya know that.\" Dodger grinned and began tucking in; soon he was under the watchful gaze of the other boys whose breakfasts hadn't hit the sides. Tito edged closer, hoping that Dodger would be distracted enough by Rita's presence that he wouldn't fiercely guard his meal. Crawling flat to the floor, the Chihuahua prepared to strike. Francis watched closely, knowing that if the mutt took a swipe at Tito, it would present a real opportunity for him to swoop in and go for seconds. Rita shook her head, sighing. Those boys would take any opportunity to stir up a squabble. She quickly downed the rest of her food, effectively taking herself out of the firing line, and retreated to the living room. Within seconds, the kitchen had erupted into barks and growls, and a clattering of paws on the tiles. True to form, the boys were starting the day with a scrap, which quickly rolled out of the kitchen and into the main area of the house. In the ruckus that ensued, Evie found herself intensely fearful of being swept into the writhing tangle of teeth and claws in her attempt to get away. Then, her eyes found Rita. Evie was an intelligent cat, and she'd learned very quickly that when things got scary, the safest place to be was with the slight, silky-furred hound. No one messed with Rita when she meant business- no one - so she made an excellent protector, even being a dog. Evie scuttled across the floor and scampered up onto Rita's back. \"Sorry about those idiots,\" Rita said, rolling her eyes. She'd kept her own inclusion in rough-housing to a bare minimum since taking up with the Foxworths, mainly out of sensitivity to Evie's anxieties. It worked both ways though; if Rita had Evie with her, the rest of the gang would leave her out of any brawling, which in some ways was a blessing. Back home, she'd have little chance of being left alone once things got really rowdy. With Evie perched on her back, Rita suspected that she could walk right through the middle of the scuffle and the others would simply part. Everyone respected Evie enough to ensure she never got caught up in what she might deem to be frightening behaviour. \"Just relax, 'kay? I'll take ya somewhere quiet.\" Evie remained tense, digging her claws into Rita's flank as she moved away from the tangle of dogs. It wasn't exactly comfortable for the hound, but she remained patient and understanding. To Evie, she knew, the playful scrap would be a reminder of her own experiences getting caught up in the aggressive games of Flint and his crew of thugs. Rita took the cat out to the balcony out of Mr and Mrs Foxworth's bedroom; out the way of the rest of the gang, and the often-unfriendly Georgette, and sat down. \"You okay, kid?\" Rita asked kindly. Evie slid down and looked at her own paws, embarrassed that she was still so frightened. \"Yeah. I'm fine.\" \"You've done great, hon. I know it don't feel like it- but you've had five extra dogs runnin' round here for weeks; that's a lot to deal with.\" \"I guess so,\" said Evie, not entirely convinced. \"Look, think about it,\" Rita said, \"you were expecting us round for what? Christmas dinner? And ya ended up dealin' with so much more, never even complainin'. You're a brave kid, Evie.\" \"Thanks.\" Evie found herself looking up at Rita with a smile. Having her as a friend had been an enormous help over those past gruelling weeks, with the kind hound doing everything she could to ease Evie's distress whenever it all became too much. In fact, Evie rarely left the security of Jenny's bedroom in that time unless she knew that Rita was around. Oliver remained her perfect, devoted best friend, but when it came to giving a sense of safety from the rowdier dogs, Rita was exactly what she needed. \"I wish you didn't have to go. You've been so good to me,\" Evie said softly. Just a few months ago, she couldn't have imagined enjoying the company of a canine- and a street dog at that- but her gratitude to Rita was strong. Rita gave her tail a wag. \"I'll be seeing you again, don't you worry about that, child. I could use a girlfriend to talk to; I love the boys, don't get me wrong, but it would be nice to have some girl time now and then. I don't have a lotta close friends outside the gang. Besides, I've got Ollie to keep comin' back for too.\" She lay down, looking out to the street below, and the snowy park beyond it. As Evie rubbed her little face against her foreleg affectionately, Rita felt honoured. Here was a child damaged by her kind, and yet she was forgiving, open to build the trust they now shared. She suspected that Oliver's bold and loving nature had helped in this recovery, and that he'd continue to help the timid Evie take even more brave steps forward. Rita began grooming Evie, running her tongue gently over her back and head. Taken by surprise, having never been given such affectionate contact by a dog, Evie jumped, but quickly relaxed. She closed her eyes and purred. \"I'd like that,\" she said, \"I've never had a girl friend; I only had brothers… and Georgette's not really my type friendship-wise.\" Rita laughed, bark-like. \"I don't think Georgette's many people's type friendship-wise,\" she said. \"Ollie's probably told ya this, but she's not as bad as she makes out- when it comes down to it she'll take your side… but only if you're down to the wire. Maybe she's just not practiced in havin' friends; you might find her softer side if you poke around a little.\" Evie was not convinced. To her, Georgette was nothing short of a bully; someone best avoided at all costs. It had been a great help to have Oliver's friends- Rita in particular- to step in and stand up for her when needed, but they'd be leaving that very day. \"She's insecure, that's all,\" Rita added, sensing the young cat was still ill-at-ease. \"She what?\" Evie demanded. Surely, the hound was talking about a different person. \"Georgette's totally full of herself!\" \"They're not mutually exclusive. Georgette's spent most of her life getting her own way, she's never had to share anything that mattered to her. She was jealous of Oliver, and probably a part of her is jealous again.\" \"Maybe, but there's no way she wants to be my friend. She has too much fun pushing me around.\" Rita placed her slender paw over Evie's back; a show of support. \"You'll learn to stand up to her in time,\" she said, \"and until that happens, Ollie's got your back. He knows where to find me if you ever need to talk, or just want some female company.\" Evie purred, surprising herself with just how at ease she felt with this tough street dog. It was a sign that she was growing stronger within herself, and it gave her hope that she might be able to get over her past in time. She smiled up at Rita, grateful for her friendship. \"So, kitty, wanna hang out for a while?\" the hound asked, \"Fagin's not takin' us home 'til the afternoon; we can have some girl time.\" As Oliver had feared, the day flew by all too quickly, and the gang was soon piling up into the back of Fagin's scooter, ready to head home. The young cat felt a strong urge to hop in with them; they were his family, just as much as Jenny was. Saying goodbye after the wonderful time spent together was painful. Jenny scooped him up into her arms and waved his paw for him. As his friends howled their goodbyes he howled back, and wished that things didn't have to go back to normal. Dodger looked wistfully back at Oliver, who was soon out of sight, knowing that he'd miss him desperately in the days and weeks to come. But this was the way it was; he was a street dog, and he didn't ever feel at home in Oliver's place, even surrounded by family as he was. The patched-up barge was tidier, with the junk sorted into neat piles and boxes, and the roof reinforced with fresh planks of wood that would provide the necessary shelter from the wind and rain. The dogs took in the surroundings; which included a sofa-bed for Fagin to sleep on, and a second-hand television set. As Roscoe had destroyed their last T.V., this was of particular excitement- to most anyway. Francis sniffed. \"Well, I can't say I wouldn't rather have stayed in the magnificent 5th Avenue abode,\" he muttered as he looked around. \"You serious, Frank?\" Rita asked, bewildered by her companion's attitude. This was home, and it always would be; and now it was even better than it had been before. \"You belong here, my brother.\" \"Well, I've never been more flattered in all my years,\" Francis replied, scowling. \"And I won't be having any of this 'Frank' business, Rita.\" Tito jumped up onto Francis' back, and then onto his head, causing the bulldog to shake irritably. \"Aw, man! Ya gotta unwind, man! This is home- we should be celebratin'! Look; we got a T.V. and everything!\" Einstein, for one, did not share Francis' disappointment at returning to the barge. He spun in a circle, with an expression of pure glee on his face. \"We're home!\" he howled, and he tripped over Dodger in his excitement. \"I really missed this place,\" he said, pulling himself to his feet and gazing happily around. Rita scooted past her companions and lay down in her familiar old bed. Looking up, she saw that the holes in the roof had been patched up, and it seemed she would no longer have to put up with rain coming in while she tried to sleep. It was the same shabby old barge; it still smelt of dog and damp, the floor still creaked, and nothing about it was remotely luxurious, but in her eyes, it was perfect. Francis really did not know how lucky he was. Unlike him, Rita had been homeless on the streets during the depth of winter, and she knew it was no walk in the park. The Foxworths had a nice place; but in every way that really mattered, the barge was just as good- at least now all the leaks had been fixed. Rita exhaled in contentment, and watched without really listening as Francis and Tito argued over goodness knows what. She grinned as Dodger, making himself comfortable in front of the 'new' television, caught her eye with an affectionate glance. Yes, she was sure of it; there was nothing more a dog could need.[Chapter 12] When spring rolled around at last, it was met with much relief. The warmer weather made a great deal of difference to Einstein in particular, as the cold had made him more stiff and uncomfortable in his old age. As the change swept through, a spring came back his step, and for the time being at least, Einstein was not feeling his age so much. Not being constantly cold lifted everyone's mood, and the gang barely went a day without at least one high-spirited dog pile or game of chase. With the sun shining down, the living was easy- at least by the gang's standards. Rita woke slowly; there was no real rush as they were going through a good spell, having eaten well all week. She was vaguely aware of Tito and Francis bickering. It was a sign she'd overslept; clearly they'd both been up long enough to get on one another's nerves, though it had to be granted, that didn't always take long. Rita sighed; for all that they were at each other, Francis and Tito were very close, but the noise wasn't exactly welcome for someone trying to enjoy a comfortable lie in. Still, it was not worth the effort to sort them out. She rolled over, trying to block the noise out. Blearily looking across the barge, she saw that Dodger was still fast asleep. She smiled and watched him for a few moments, feeling peacefulness radiating off him in contrast to the bickering of the others. Things were good between the two of them, and Dodger had been happier since Oliver had worked out how to get to and from the barge without assistance, and so visited more often. Suddenly, Rita was startled by a wet splash on her snout and looked up to see Einstein standing over her, drooling. \"Good morning!\" Einstein said cheerfully. \"Morning, Einy.\" Rita smiled. She didn't particularly enjoy being dribbled on, but it was hard to begrudge Einstein that; he couldn't help it. She shook herself and got to her feet. Instantly, Francis and Tito fell quiet, knowing that Rita was prone to snapping at them when they fought. Rita was rather satisfied by their response to her presence, it sure made life easier. As always, her first port of call for the morning was to greet Fagin who was resting half-asleep in his chair, with a lick (or several) and an enthusiastic series of tail wags. Rita then sidled up to Dodger's bed, having decided that he'd slept long enough. \"Dodge, you awake? You know you've got work to do, right?\" Dodger opened one eye and grinned, seeing an opportunity for mischief. He quickly grabbed Rita by her ear, and with a paw over her side pulled her roughly off her paws and onto his bed. She laughed as they tangled playfully, sending Dodger's cushions flying. It was only moments before the pair slid to the floor in a heap, and needing no more encouragement, Einstein and Tito were on top of them biting and growling, with Francis only a short way behind. \"Great job, Dodger, look what you've started.\" Rita said, after pulling herself briefly from the flailing mass of paws and teeth. Caught up in the good feeling of the morning, she was soon back in the fray. After all, someone needed to kick the boys into line. \"Woah, woah- calm down! It's a bit early in the day to be scrapping, come on- no! Enough!\" Fagin's words fell on deaf ears as he got up to sort his dogs out. This was not his idea of a wake-up call, and a good sign that it was time to get going. \"Looks like we'd better get going, you've all got to burn some energy off. Come on boys, cut it out!\" Finally, the rumble died down as everyone was eager to get out into the city, where they could really make the most of the good day. Still laughing as they headed out, Rita walked close to Dodger and exchanged an affectionate glance. Stepping out into the sun, Rita took a moment to appreciate the beautiful day. The water was shimmering in the bright light, and the city was full of colour- and so inviting. \"You comin', Rit?\" Dodger called her from the back of the scooter, budging up a little to encourage her to sit beside him. Several hours working the streets had proven to be fruitful for Rita. Having been fortunate enough to have encountered a rookie hotdog vendor, she'd had no trouble at all in securing dinner for the gang. Being no fool, Rita always made certain to not focus too heavily on single targets when it came to theft; humans didn't take kindly to a perceived 'dog problem', and the last thing she wanted was an animal control thug on her tail. Fresh meat, clearly inexperienced in dealing with canine pests, was always welcome, and Rita was quick to take advantage. She'd give the newbie vendor a couple of weeks' reprieve and then go in for a second siege. After such success, Rita made her way back to the barge; she might go back out later to search for trash that may be of use to Fagin, but for the time being at least, she was a lady of leisure. Rita came down the steps, and immediately became aware that she was not alone. She wagged her tail cheerfully. \"Hey kid, how long have you been waitin' here?\" She greeted Oliver with a friendly nuzzle. The ginger cat was now over a year old and filling out, becoming quite a large cat. Even though he was now a young adult, Oliver was still referred to by the dogs as 'the kid', not that he particularly minded. He was grinning, obviously pleased to have caught someone at home before he had to return to his own. \"Not too long, I guess,\" he said, \"I wasn't really sure what time you'd be back- I really better get back home soon. Jenny will be coming home from school.\" \"I'll take you back if you want, I could probably get you there quicker.\" \"You don't mind?\" \"Nah, it's no problem. I get to catch up with you properly that way.\" Rita wagged her tail cheerily. \"You can ride on my back if you want; poor little cat like you, you've only got little legs. Your car surfing could use some work too- easier if you leave it to me.\" \"Wow,\" Oliver said. \"Thanks, you really know how to flatter a guy.\" Rita barked a laugh. \"Oh, sweetie, you're all right.\" The pair headed back out onto the docks and started towards Oliver's home. Rita crouched, inviting the cat to ride on her back. Being more used to riding around on Dodger's back (with a bandanna to hold on to!) Oliver was sure to hang on tight, his paws around Rita's neck, careful not to dig his claws in. It wasn't actually too uncomfortable, Rita moved much less erratically than Dodger did, with long, graceful strides. It was only when she started leaping around through the traffic that Oliver had to struggle slightly to stay on board. \"It's great that I can see you guys more often, now I know my way around a bit more,\" Oliver said, as Rita came smoothly back onto the pavement. \"Yeah, I know Dodger's been enjoying havin' you around too,\" Rita responded. \"Maybe I could bring Evie sometime, she's gotten a whole lot more confident. You guys wouldn't mind if she tagged along?\" Rita slowed down a little. \"I don't know if that's a good idea, kid,\" she said, solemnly. \"I know Evie's come a long way, but it's a big difference between getting her comfortable being around a few dogs, and expecting her to cope with what the streets might throw at her. There's no avoiding strange dogs, and her confidence doesn't need knockin'.\" \"Yeah, but we'll be looking after her, right?\" Oliver asked, taken aback by his friend's response but undeterred. \"She won't have anything to be scared of if she's with us.\" \"Oliver,\" Rita said, firmer, \"I'm not gonna be responsible for someone who'd be better off in her own home, where she's happy and safe.\" As Oliver made a noise as if preparing to argue, she added. \"Have you thought of what might happen if she got recognised by one of Flint's lot? Do you have any idea how messy things could get?\" \"They can't be worse than Roscoe and DeSoto.\" Oliver said confidently. He'd dealt with dangerous dogs, and was certain he could do so again if the situation required it. Oliver's apparent lack of fear made Rita uneasy… there was bravery, and then there was being stupid. Even Tito had more sense than to tangle with dogs like the brutes in Flint's gang. \"Only a fool would underestimate dogs like that,\" she said. \"They're much smarter than Roscoe and DeSoto- they've gotta be, surviving on their wits. There's a lot of them, and they know dogs all over; we could be in deep trouble before you know it. Evie doesn't deserve that.\" Oliver's fur bristled. \"She didn't deserve to be abused by them in the first place! If I got the chance, I'd take them on, inflict just a little bit of the pain they put on her.\" \"Don't be so stupid. You're no good to Evie in pieces. What she does need is a friend. I gotta tell ya, kid, right now you don't sound like someone mature enough to take care of yourself, let alone anyone else. After all we've done for you, you'd be willing to put us all in danger to make a point? Grow up; this isn't a game.\" The cat fell quiet, hurt by Rita's putting him down, but getting the point. His blood boiled at the thought of any dog treating Evie cruelly, and the urge to make a stand was hard to ignore, but if they were as dangerous as Rita thought they were, Flint's gang would be too much to take on- even with the support of his friends. The last thing he wanted was to put their lives on the line, and was now ashamed that he'd even brought it up. He hadn't even thought… Despite her harsh words, Rita was sympathetic towards Oliver. She had to admire his tenacity and desire to help his friend, even if he wanted to go about it all the wrong way. \"Think of it this way, kid,\" she said, softening, \"how'd ya think Evie would feel if you got hurt, or worse? That wouldn't do a thing to help her. She needs stability and a little understanding, that's all. If she's gonna move on, you're gonna have to as well.\" \"Okay,\" said Oliver finally. \"I guess you know best.\" He shrugged, feeling deflated. What he'd really wanted was a quick fix for Evie's fears, but it seemed he'd just have to be patient. Perhaps his dreams of roaming the great city with her by his side were just fantasy, and would always stay that way. \"Hey, Rita, I'm not thinkin' about doin' anythin' stupid, but what do you actually think the chances would be to get caught out by those jerks in a city this size? Don't those guys have a sorta territory they stick to?\" \"It's not likely,\" Rita said, glad that Oliver had taken her words on board. \"but they do get around. They used Evie to gain information on enemies; it's how they work, manipulating the weak to expand their own knowledge. If they did track her down, I'm sure they'd kill her. It's a small chance, but there's a lot on the line. It only takes one little bit of bad luck.\" Oliver sighed heavily. It had been so easy in the past to see Dodger and the gang as invincible when it came to the street life, but the reality was far from it. \"Look, kid, if Evie really wants to get outta the house, we might be able to take her out to places that are busy with humans- hardly any dogs would come near.\" An idea came to Rita, and she wagged her tail. \"Maybe you could even give her a little disguise or something; she's changed a lot since Flint had her, and if she you put her in a little outfit, she could probably pass right under one of their noses. And we'd all come with you two. Just a bit of back up as a precaution.\" \"All right, that sounds good.\" Oliver cheered up a little. \"I know Georgette's got a few cute little numbers that she's tried on Tito,\" he said with a laugh. \"I guess I'll talk to Evie, see what she thinks, and you can talk to Dodger.\" For a little while, Oliver ran alongside Rita, taking many quick strides to keep up with her long, loping ones. \"Are there a lot of dog gangs around?\" Oliver enquired, realising that he didn't actually know much at all about the street dog life, despite his bond with Dodger's gang. \"I've only really seen street dogs skulking 'round on their own.\" \"Not really; most groups of dogs on the streets are quite loose; there's a lot of coming and going,\" Rita explained. \"If you get too many dogs together, it unnerves the humans. Most street dogs want to avoid attention if they can. There are a couple of places where a load of dogs will meet up, but a lot of them don't really know each other. There are a few serious gangs, like Flint's lot, but there aren't many around thankfully. There's some real nutters out there, and they always seem to find each other. It helps if you know who to avoid.\" \"So how did you guys all get together then?\" Oliver asked. \"You're not doing a great job of avoiding humans; you're lookin' pretty cosy of Fagin.\" Rita smirked. \"Well, to start with it was just Fagin and Einstein,\" she began, \"they just sorta found each other. Both of them were on their own before then, so I guess they enjoyed the company. Einstein was a pet, and I think he missed having someone to give him a good scratch behind the ears; he was never nervous of humans. It was just the two of them for a few years, and then Dodger came along as a tiny pup- they raised him, and then Dodge brought me home. We were just kids then, Dodge and me; we grew up on the streets together, learnin' from each other. He used to say I was his 'apprentice'.\" Rita grinned and continued. \"Francis and Tito came along later; Fagin found them. It wasn't exactly easy to start with. Francis wasn't really used to livin' with other dogs, or bein' on the streets for that matter. Dodge and I were maybe a bit full on back then too. We were teenagers and we didn't exactly make it easy for him. Francis had it in his head that he was better than us, what with his privileged upbringing- but we didn't put up with any of that. Frankie used to always say that we were a bad influence on Tito, but really that was never giving Tito enough credit, he didn't need any influence to be a pain in the tail; it came naturally to him.\" Oliver laughed, trying to imagine his friends as adolescents. They all went back such a long way… \"But, it all worked out in the end, I guess some of us grew up- or I did anyway. We're family now, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, I love those guys.\" Rita finished as she trotted along beside the fence surrounding the park. He'd never regretted his decision to stay with Jenny, but Oliver couldn't help wondering how he'd have fitted in if he'd never left the gang. He regarded them as his second family, and often felt torn, wanting to see more of them, especially Dodger. At the same time, he couldn't lose sight of his responsibility to Jenny and Evie, who both relied on him greatly, and whom he loved dearly. Even Georgette meant a great deal to him, and he knew he'd miss her if he was away with his other friends all the time. Rita stopped outside the house and gazed through the window. \"Best I don't come in, right?\" she asked, remembering that recent developments were likely to have reduced the family's tolerance for dirty street dogs making themselves at home. \"Yeah,\" Oliver said sadly, \"Mrs Foxworth's not so keen to have you guys hanging around the house, not now she's home waiting for the baby to come.\" \"You say 'hi' to Evie for me though,\" Rita said, \"And Georgette as well if you catch her in a good mood.\" Oliver chuckled, \"Stranger things have happened. I'll see you round then. Thanks for taking me home, it was good to talk.\" \"Anytime.\" Rita winked and turned to go, \"See ya later, kitty.\" As night fell on the Foxworth's grand 5th Avenue house, Oliver was merrily playing with Jenny, tumbling around on her bed. With a new baby on the way, and her parents largely distracted, Jenny was lonely and took a great deal of comfort in the companionship of her animals. Oliver was devoted to her as ever and was concerned that the little girl was struggling with the changes taking place in her life. Evie watched them quietly, smiling to herself. \"Jennifer! I think it's time you went to bed!\" A voice came from the hallway. \"Okay, Winston,\" Jenny called back. \"That's enough playing for tonight, Oliver, it's getting late.\" She headed off to wash, leaving her cats sprawled on the bed. \"So, Oliver, are you going to take me out into the city soon then?\" Evie asked, \"You've not mentioned the idea since this morning.\" \"Sorry Evie, I was going to talk to you about that, I've been so busy taking care of Jenny,\" said Oliver. \"Jenny's fine, you practically live on her lap, she can hardly be lonely with you around.\" \"But she is lonely, and I feel responsible for making sure she's all right.\" Oliver responded, somewhat defensively. \"Her parents hardly have time for her as it is, and soon she'll be even less of a priority. Someone's gotta be there for her.\" \"I'm not criticising, I think it's sweet that you care about her so much. I'm just not into the constant cuddles nonsense myself.\" Evie stretched out, purring, her body much fuller in figure than when she'd first become a fixture of the Foxworth household, and her coat much shinier. Oliver laughed, he didn't imagine Evie would ever be the outgoing sort, apart from her friendship with him, she definitely liked to keep herself to herself. \"Anyway, I did talk to Rita about taking you out with me,\" Oliver furrowed his eyebrows, \"She didn't seem that keen on the idea actually, which kinda surprised me. She's worried about you, and I think worried that sooner or later one of Flint's gang might catch wind of where you are. Evie suddenly became very unnerved. \"But that wouldn't happen, right? They don't really come around these parts I didn't think. They were from a rough part of town.\" \"Yeah, Rita said it's unlikely. I think she just wants to make sure we're careful about it, she said you should go out with the gang so at least you've got some back up in an emergency. And we could put you in some of Georgette's clothes, so no-one would recognise you if they were around.\" \"Really?\" Evie asked with a sigh. That didn't sound like what she'd had in mind. \"How am I supposed to actually enjoy myself if I've got five dogs hanging round me the whole time? I like them, really I do, but I don't know if I could handle that kind of situation. Wouldn't just one or two of them be fine?\" Much as she wanted to get out and live a little- and spend more time with Oliver when he went out and about, Evie found the prospect was getting more and more unattractive. Seeing the look on Evie's face, Oliver rubbed his face against hers in what could best be described as a cat hug, \"Hey, we'll sort something out, I promise. Maybe we'll just hang around near the house for now- no way the likes of Flint would be seen dead round here!\" Evie purred appreciatively, and got up and quietly retreated to her own bed, a sturdy basket with a wonderfully soft and squashy cushion. She curled up, and watched as Oliver greeted Jenny, who was now all ready for bed and, as always, settling down with Oliver right by her side. \"Goodnight Oliver, goodnight Evie.\" Jenny said sleepily. Evie closed her eyes, and smiled to herself. No matter what, she was grateful for Oliver. She'd never known another cat quite like him, and she couldn't imagine having a better friend to help her get through all her fears and worries.[Chapter 13] With work done for the day and Oliver safely back home, Rita had been enjoying the night out and about in the docks surrounding the barge, with Dodger by her side. They gladly took advantage of the chance to have some time alone together. In the weeks since the change in their relationship they'd both needed to adjust to it all, particularly Dodger, who often struggled to keep a lid on his tendency to tease random women as he went about the city. Their relationship remained pretty relaxed, but Rita did sometimes tire of Dodger's antics. Still, things were getting better all the time and both had reached a point where they were content with the arrangement. Out on the docks there was no one else around, so the pair could freely express their affections to one another without intrusion- in contrast from the usual lack of privacy back at the barge. Dodger was eager to hear how Oliver was, knowing that Rita had spent time with him that afternoon. \"You might have to go 'round and see the kid soon, he's wanting to take Evie out,\" Rita said, sitting up from a long cuddle with her mate. \"I figured it would be best if they were accompanied, just to be safe. Although I think she'd be better off just staying at home. I know she's gotten better, but it wouldn't take much to give her a scare.\" \"Aw, babe, sooner or later, kid's gotta push herself sometime. If she thinks she's up to it, what's stoppin' her?\" \"She's been in trouble before,\" Rita said solemnly, \"I don't want her to go through anything like that again.\" \"What, you're worried about Flint or something?\" Dodger stretched out, completely at ease. Trust Rita to be a worry-wart. \"Ya know it's not like those creeps are likely to be hangin' around those parts, there's hardly any chance at all of her getting spotted by anyone. Besides, that was months ago, she looks real different to when she last saw any of them.\" Dodger was well aware that Oliver would be around more often if he wasn't feeling guilty about leaving Evie home on her own. Much as he preferred not to share the companionship of his feline best friend, Dodger was bright enough to see the benefits. \"You're right, I know you're right.\" Rita murmured. \"It's just the thought of that kid gettin' mixed up in all that…\" She shivered involuntarily. Stories of Flint and his gang had reached the ears of just about every street dog in the city… and many dogs Rita knew had friends and relatives that had met a mucky end when they'd crossed those brutes. Others had gone missing after being rumoured to have been involved with Flint. Rita had enough sense to know when to keep away from such dogs, but Oliver was young and naïve; it couldn't be expected of him to stay safe without a bit of guidance. She knew enough about the young cat to fear that his foolhardiness and sense of chivalry could easily get him into deep trouble. \"Don't worry about it,\" Dodger winked, \"It'll be good to hang out with the kid anyhow, and in the unlikely event of an emergency, they'll have the Dodge to help them out. And if he needs any romantic advice with Evie, who better to help with that too?\" Rita scoffed. \"Honey, you are the last person to be giving romantic advice. We're together in spite of your way with the ladies, not because of it.\" She licked his cheek with a smirk. \"Thanks Rita, it's good to know my contribution to our partnership is appreciated.\" Dodger nipped at her ear. \"Love you.\" \"Love you too, Dodgie-baby,\" Rita laughed, and she leaned to caress his face with her muzzle. Dodger grinned, and nuzzled Rita's chest and neck. He loved being close to her, and their connection had only gotten stronger. Rita gently bumped her head against his and smiled back. It had been months, but Rita felt that same giddy excitement when she was close to him. She exhaled in contentment as she felt Dodger beside her, allowing her concerns for Oliver to disappear from her mind for a while. With no reason to rush off home, the pair snuggled close and allowed themselves to lose track of time in one another's company. The pair headed home some hours later, and quietly padded past their sleeping friends. Recently, Winston had gifted Fagin a small sofa-bed, which had quickly become a greatly sought after place to sleep. Fagin was slowly being edged to a smaller and smaller portion of the bed as Einstein happily stretched out, snoring in contentment. Francis was snoozing in the space between Einstein's outstretched fore and hind legs, and Tito was, as usual, using his companion as a mattress. Comfortable though the new piece of furniture may have been, Rita headed straight for her usual bed. In her eyes, the thought of sleeping in such a cramped area was not favourable, no matter how comfy the bed was, nor how much she loved her friends. She happily settled down and closed her eyes, ready to drift off. \"Hey Rit, you want some company in there?\" Rita opened her eyes and saw Dodger sitting beside her bed. \"Really, Dodger? I know I got myself the best spot, but I don't know why you think I'd want to share with you, I don't need keepin' warm. What's in it for me?\" She frowned, feigning annoyance. \"Wait, I'll make it worth the intrusion,\" Dodger made a beeline for his bed, pulled out a couple of cushions and dragged them back across to Rita. \"Nice try, but if there's barely enough room for the two of us, you're not going to win me over by takin' up more of my space.\" She budged over to one side all the same, \"But if you insist…\" Rita pulled a pillow in tucked it comfortably under her forelegs and rested her head. \"It's a good thing you're just a little mutt, you might be able to squeeze in here.\" Dodger lay down next to her, resting his head on her neck. \"Night, Rita.\" He closed his eyes, \"We should hang 'round the park tomorrow, might take the kid out for a bit.\" \"Sounds good,\" Rita whispered sleepily, though she was hardly listening. \"Night, Dodge.\" The sun was shining brightly the next day as the gang headed out into the city. As planned, they first paid a visit to the Foxworth home, to invite Oliver out for the day after he'd missed most of them the day before. Hearing the barking from outside, Oliver ran to the window excitedly and quickly made off to join his friends. \"Hey kid, how ya been?\" Dodger playfully gave the cat his signature high-five, pulling his paw away at the last moment. \"Just you today, huh?\" Tito looked hopefully behind Oliver. Disappointingly, Georgette didn't appear to be coming along for the ride. With Mrs Foxworth unwilling to have Fagin's dogs wandering through the house, it didn't make it easy for Tito to enjoy a romantic relationship with the pampered poodle… though some might say the distance was the reason it hadn't all fallen apart again. \"Just me; Georgette says she's got a reputation to maintain. To be honest, I'm not really sure if it's me she doesn't want to be seen with or you guys.\" \"Both, I'd imagine.\" Francis sniffed. \"But it's been weeks since I've seen her!\" Tito shouted in frustration, \"It's no good for our relationship if I'm not allowed in there and she won't come out here!\" \"What about Evie, is she not wanting to come out with you?\" Rita asked over the top of Tito's complaints. Oliver shook his head, somewhat sadly. \"Nope, she's still not keen to be around all you guys at once.\" \"Her loss,\" Dodger said coolly, not at all minding that Oliver would not distracted by the pretty young cat, \"She'll come around eventually.\" \"So, what're we doin' today Dodge?\" Oliver asked eagerly, choosing not to get too hung up on Evie's continued resistance to joining them. \"We might just hang around the park,\" Dodger stretched out. \"Maybe share in a picnic or two. If you're up for it.\" \"Yay, food! I'm starving!\" Einstein bounced along enthusiastically. \"Einstein, feeding you is a simply pointless exercise; you could consume your own bodyweight and still complain of hunger.\" Francis said loftily, following behind. \"Einy, you comin'?\" Dodger called over to the Great Dane, who appeared startled to hear his name being called. They were now deep into the park, managing to keep out of the way of dogcatchers and enjoying all the sights and scents. Einstein, though, was way away from the main group, and had the misty-eyed expression of someone only vaguely aware of what was going on. \"Sorry Dodger, I got a bit lost.\" Einstein replied, somewhat embarrassed. He'd wandered away, off in his own little world, and had found himself confused and disorientated once his friends were out of sight. It seemed to be happening to him more and more but he hadn't been letting it worry him. His friends always told him that he was a bit dumb, and he guessed this was just what being a bit dumb entailed. \"How'd ya get lost, we're right over here?\" Tito demanded, \"You did this yesterday too- we're gonna haveta put ya on a leash, man!\" \"I guess I'm just getting confused,\" Einstein said sadly, \"I'll try and pay attention better.\" It occurred to Rita that Einstein seemed to be getting confused quite frequently these days, and as she thought about it, she realised that recently he'd been rather forgetful. But then, Einstein wasn't exactly on the ball a lot of the time anyway, it was probably nothing to worry about. He was just being his usual dopey self. Rita pushed the concerns to the back of her mind; today was for enjoying quality time with the kid, not worrying over nothing. Oliver ran along after his friends, and was pleased to be able to keep up fairly well and finding the rough-housing not nearly as alarming as he had in his younger days. Everyone still made the effort to go pretty easy on him- after all, a dogpile is no place for a cat, but Oliver was happily getting stuck in and giving almost as good as he got. The wide open space meant they could really run, and Rita loved the sense of freedom it brought. Her speed gave her a good advantage in such an area, in that she could make a quick getaway between playful assaults on the others and avoid retaliation. Such a tactic soon led to being targeted by everyone all at once, and very quickly Rita was back in the thick of the scrap. Rain from earlier in the day had left the ground wet and muddy, and in the chaos of the 'fight' everyone became extremely dirty- not something the usually immaculately kept Oliver was all that used to. Finally everyone began to wind down, except for Tito who was still bouncing around and spoiling for a scrap. Rita swatted her paw at him irritably and lay down next to Francis, who was getting very close to giving in and chasing after the Chihuahua who continued to taunt them. Dodger sauntered over, \"Hey Tito, chill out man.\" He sat down, and Oliver, who had been riding around on his back, slid onto the ground. \"Is it time for food now?\" Einstein asked hopefully. The Great Dane was sprawled on his side, recovering from all the fun, so much activity had left him with quite the appetite, even more so than usual. \"All right, all right. You guys ready to get to work?\" \"Okay Dodgie-baby, best not to leave Tito in charge of lookin' after the kid this time, huh?\" Rita teased, at the risk of getting Tito all flared up again. \"Maybe we should barbeque you and see how well you babysit!\" Tito shouted, jumping up in anger. \"Thing is, Tito, I'm smart enough not to go fryin' my brains,\" Rita got to her feet, \"Come on, let's get goin'. I'm starving.\" Dodger led the others through the park, keeping an eye and an ear out for opportunities for an easy meal, with Oliver trotting eagerly by his side. He looked down to the cat with a grin, loving having him around. Before long, they came onto a family of picnickers, who had left their meal almost totally unguarded as they played Frisbee nearby. An elderly lady hunched over a book was the only thing standing between the dogs and a real feast. Dodger's ears pricked in anticipation and the others gathered around him under the cover of some large bushes. \"Okay troops, we're goin' for the picnic, that meatloaf has our names written all over it. Francis, you get the old girl away from the rug, give her a performance to remember. Tito, Einstein- keep those guys busy,\" he motioned with a shake of his head towards the preoccupied family, \"They look like they could use a couple more players.\" Francis puffed out his chest, proud to undertake duties of such a theatrical nature. Einstein drooled, and licked his lips involuntarily. Dodger turned back to Oliver, \"Right kid, you're with Rita and me. We're gonna swipe ourselves a feast.\" The cat nodded eagerly. As the others headed off, Dodger and Rita watched carefully for the best moment to make a move, knowing there would most likely be only a narrow window of opportunity. As the family chased after Einstein and Tito, who had made off with their toy, Dodger moved forward stealthily with Oliver close behind. He saw the old lady move away from the picnic, concerned and distracted by the apparently dying bulldog who moaned and writhed in grass, and he made his move, reaching the feast at the same time as Rita. Without a moment's hesitation, Dodger swiped the leftover meatloaf that was sitting on a plate in the middle of the rug, and Rita uncovered a large meat pie. It was a struggle to properly grip the pie in its dish, and Rita glanced around hastily to ascertain whether there was enough time to remove it. Desperate to be of some help, Oliver got stuck in with his little paws and managed to dislodge the tempting treat from its casing. \"Thanks, kid!\" Rita said, somewhat muffled as she had managed to get a proper hold of the pie in her mouth. Hearing a shout from the old woman, who had turned to see the chaos that had been made of the picnic, she nudged Oliver to get him moving to safety, and made a quick dash to cover a safe distance away where Dodger was waiting. \"Hey, ya missed a bit!\" Dodger laughed, noticing that a large portion of the pie had been dropped in the quick exit. Rita frowned, looking down to see that her prize was not all there. \"Still, should be enough to feed everyone. And at least I managed not to lose the kid.\" They were soon joined by Tito, Francis and Einstein, who were all eager to enjoy the fruits of their labour. Oliver held back, eating a little just to be polite but not wanting to take away from a meal that meant much more to his friends that it could for him. Dodger noticed Oliver looking a little uncomfortable. \"You want to hang out for a little while, just you and me?\" \"Yeah, sure, just as long as I get back in time for Jenny coming home from school.\" Oliver replied, brightening up a little. \"No problem, I'll get ya home.\" Dodger let the cat climb onto his back. \"See you guys 'round.\" \"Later sweetie.\" Rita licked Dodger's cheek, and turned to Oliver, \"I'll see you soon, kid.\" After saying their goodbyes to Oliver, the gang went their separate ways. There was still time in the day to get some more work done and bring home some loot for Fagin, but first Rita wanted to pay a visit to Evie. She figured it might be some use if she could talk to Evie about what had happened with Flint and his gang, then maybe they might be able to work out a way forward. Rita made her way out of the park and back towards Oliver's place. Though she barked to alert Evie of her presence, she was not surprised when he calls were not met with a response- being scared of dogs as she was, Evie was not likely to come running to the sound of one barking outside. Neither could Rita really expect Georgette to respond; the poodle had no intention of being seen to socialise with common street dogs. Moving closer to Jenny's bedroom window, Rita shouted up to Evie, letting her know who it was making all the noise. Finally, Evie got the message and opened the front door. \"You know,\" she said, \"you're not meant to come in here, the mistress won't be happy.\" Evie peered cautiously behind Rita, making sure that no other dogs were following after her. \"I'll be out of the way soon. Just wondered if you'd like to talk- I figured you might be a little lonely with Oliver out all day,\" Rita said, \"We could go outside and just hang out for a while.\" \"Oh,\" said Evie, a little taken aback. She'd not really had a visitor come for the sole purpose of talking to her before. Being shy as she was, it had been comfortable for her to socialise with Oliver by her side, but this was different. Still, all her prior experiences had told her that Rita was trustworthy, and it did feel nice to be thought of. \"Uh, uh yes. Okay. It would be nice to have someone to talk to- other than Georgette, that is, she's real mean.\" Rita frowned. \"She's still treatin' you bad? I would have thought she'd have got over herself by now.\" \"She doesn't really talk to me, just looks at me like I'm something dirty,\" said Evie, \"Oliver says it's because she's worried she'll get forgotten about with me and Oliver here and a baby on the way as well. She doesn't mind Ollie so much, but she really doesn't like me.\" \"Guess she's used to having her own way and no competition, huh? Don't worry about it too much- and if she's givin' you too much trouble I can give her a talking to,\" Rita said. Evie smiled appreciatively. \"Thanks. Ollie does stick up for me too, he's not nervous of her or anything.\" They went back outside, avoiding trouble with Evie's pregnant mistress, and sprawled on the lawn. It wasn't a large yard, but it was neat and tidy, every bush or tree perfectly trimmed. The garden caught the sun and it made for a very pleasant place to rest, with a gentle breeze wafting around scents from the flowers. Rita shook the fur from her face and looked to Evie, noticing that the young cat still appeared slightly unsure about being called on to socialise with a canine. \"So, sweetie, I hear you've been wanting to get out a bit more.\" \"I hear you're not thinking it's a good idea,\" said Evie quietly. \"I think you should be careful,\" Rita said, trying to assess whether the young cat was really comfortable enough to talk about the issue. \"If it means anything to you, Dodger doesn't feel you've not anything to worry about. The chances of bumping into any of them are remote and you've changed since then anyhow. I know I'd feel better if you had someone with you who could help you out in a worst case scenario type situation. I'd hate for you to get yourself in more trouble with that lot.\" Rita looked at Evie thoughtfully. \"Maybe you could do something to change your appearance somehow? I'm sure Georgette's got plenty of make-up lyin' around.\" \"Yeah, maybe. I could get Oliver to talk to her,\" Evie said, \"And I wouldn't mind going out with one or two of you guys, but more than that and I just couldn't enjoy myself. I know you wouldn't hurt me, I just get so jumpy with a lot of dogs around.\" \"I understand, kid; if you do feel up to coming out sometime, even for just a little walk round the park, we'll be happy to be around to help,\" said Rita kindly. \"You don't have to be scared anymore, sweetie, you've got friends on your side.\" Evie still didn't quite know if she really felt up to adventures of any sort- even though she so wanted to share that part of Oliver's life with him. Trapped though she might often feel in her home, at least the only dog she had to deal with was the harmless if not pleasant Georgette. All the same, it was a nice feeling to know that Rita wanted to help- and the fact that she felt able to talk about the trauma of her past told Evie that she was making real progress… and real friends.[Chapter 14] In the early hours of the morning, Oliver was woken by the sound of barking outside. Grumbling, he buried his face in his paws and tried to block it out. He lay there for a few minutes, trying to ignore the horrible noise, before it dawned in him that the sound was coming from right outside. Bleary-eyed and sleepy, Oliver got to his feet and headed to the window, where he peered through the curtains to see Dodger waiting on the pavement. The puzzled cat slipped out the window and clambered down to the street. \"Einstein's missing,\" Dodger said, as Oliver reached him. The urgency in his voice was obvious. \"You haven't seen him around here have ya?\" He was tense, it had been long enough that it was obvious something was not right. Remembering how easily Einstein had gotten disorientated earlier only added to the concerns. \"What? You mean you haven't seen him since the afternoon?\" Oliver was surprised, and knew that if Dodger was coming around at this time of night that he must be seriously worried. \"I've not seen him.\" With a soft 'flump' Evie landed on the pavement beside Oliver, startling him. \"What's going on? Oliver, isn't it a bit late for mucking around with your friends?\" As much as she liked the gang, there was a time and a place for everything- and three in the morning was no time to socialise. \"Hey, no one made ya get outta bed,\" Dodger growled. \"Einstein's disappeared, and I just came round to check you guys hadn't seen him.\" He turned to leave. He knew that Evie meant well, but he had much more important things to think about than whether the young cat enjoyed an uninterrupted sleep or not. \"I'm sorry, I didn't realise.\" Evie said quietly, blushing in embarrassment. \"I'll help you look for him, Dodger.\" Oliver said, \"You coming Evie?\" Evie nodded firmly. Oliver's friends had always been kind to her, and she was keen to help in any way she could, even if it meant facing her fears. \"Thanks,\" Dodger forced a smile, \"The more help we've got; the better. Fagin's out searchin' as well, he's gonna check the pound in the morning if we still haven't found him.\" The frown returned to his face, \"Hopefully it won't come to that.\" Oliver and Evie followed close on Dodger's heels, to where the others were waiting. Both were taken aback at the sight of a stranger amongst them; Rita had recruited her sister, Willow, to assist with the search. Oliver felt Evie tense up beside him, and moved nearer to her in reassurance. Rita was equally surprised to see Evie had come with Oliver at a time like this, considering how anxious she'd been about the thought of being surrounded by the whole gang. More preoccupied with fears over Einstein, Rita shook off her worries regarding Evie and decided just to trust Dodger's judgement on the matter. \"Okay, we're gonna split up and meet back here every now and then to check in. When you're ready for a break, come back here an' wait for everyone else. Francis, you can go back to the barge in case Einstein goes back home. You two,\" Dodger turned to the cats, \"come with me.\" Evie gulped, and stayed close to Oliver as he moved to follow Dodger. She was extremely thankful that she wouldn't have many dogs around her at once- and especially not that stranger about whom she could not help having a bad feeling. Rita whined softly. She'd had niggles telling her that something was not right with Einstein, and felt guilty for not thinking much of it. It wasn't that they hadn't been aware that Einstein was getting older, but no one had given much thought to what it might mean for his mental health and his ability to keep himself safe. They'd failed him, it was as simple as that, and Rita was ashamed. \"We'll see you later, Dodge,\" Rita said, and she exchanged a worried glance with him; it was obvious that Dodger was taking the situation badly. Not knowing how to reassure him, she headed off towards the docks, her sister close behind her. It seemed that Willow had grasped the urgency of the situation, as she was being unusually civil and had become more eager to help. Rita wasn't sure how long Willow would be able to keep it up, but for the time being at least, she was grateful that she cared enough to contribute to the search. \"Do you think something's happened to him?\" asked Willow, once she and Rita had split from the others. Rita frowned. \"He's old. I'd like to think he's got the street smarts to stay safe, but he's not fast in the body- or the mind. Of course I'm worried he's got himself hurt; that's why we gotta find him as soon as we can.\" \"Do you even know where to start?' Willow asked, but the look on Rita's face said it all. \"He's strong for his age, and he's got a whole team out looking for him. I know we haven't seen eye to eye on a lot of things, but I'm here for you on this.\" The two bitches barely spoke to one another for over an hour, concentrating on a silent search after calling out Einstein's name proved fruitless. This late at night, drawing attention to one's self was not wise. Rita dictated the direction of travel, looping around the areas she knew Einstein tended to frequent. Twice she crossed paths with Tito, who had the same ideas of places to check, but still there was no sign of the elder dog anywhere. She took the search to the docks surrounding home, where Einstein was familiar with, and where Willow was comfortable to wander. \"How do ya lose a Great Dane anyhow?\" Rita grumbled in frustration. \"He's big enough, and he doesn't even wander around that much- it shouldn't be this hard to find him.\" Fearing for her old friend, Rita realised just how much Einstein meant to her, and felt a gnawing guilt for failing to look after him as he reached his golden years. When she had been at her must vulnerable, a lonely pup without a clue how to get by in the world, Einstein had given his all to ensure she was loved and supported. In Rita's eyes, she had failed to return that support. Had she been so wrapped up in her love life that she'd barely noticed that he'd needed help? Willow could see the pain in Rita's face, but the barriers that still stood between them prevented her from making a motion to comfort her. She looked down, avoiding eye contact. \"I need to thank you for this, Will,\" said Rita quietly. \"We haven't seen eye to eye for a long time; but this means a lot. Really, it does.\" \"Family means something to me. Einstein's yours, and you're mine, so I'll do what I can. You'd do the same.\" Rita remained unsure of Willow's intentions; it was completely out of character for her to put herself out for anyone. But at least, she thought, she had someone by her side on what would have been an even sadder and lonelier night. Dodger's strides were fast and purposeful, and his he sniffed high and low as he went. If Einstein was in trouble, it was he who bore the brunt of responsibility; he was the gang's leader, and he owed the guy that much. Focused as he was on his search, he barely even noticed the two cats who were running to keep up with his frantic pace. \"Dodge, slow down! We can't help you look if we're running after you!\" Oliver panted, knowing that Evie was really struggling. \"We got the whole park to cover, kid,\" Dodger replied harshly. \"The longer it takes us to find Einy, the more chance he's got in trouble bad.\" Nonetheless, he slowed the pace slightly, taking the opportunity to look out over the expanse of grass in front of him. There was no sign anywhere of that enormous, galumphing Dane. Oliver walked closer to Dodger's side, no longer needing to rush. \"Rita said you've known him since you were a little kid.\" He hoped that talking would do something to calm his friend. \"Yeah,\" Dodger said, finally coming to a stop, but continuing to scan the surrounding city wilderness for signs of movement. \"I've known him all my life. Wouldn' say he was like a father to me- I never needed one of those, but he was like a brother left with the babysittin'. You know, Einstein is what a dog's meant to be; loyal, takin' anythin' from us and not even thinkin' of needin' to forgive. It's easy to take advantage of that, and we all do it. Francis picks on him the worst; I tell myself I'm on Einy's side, but I know I've let him down really. Poor, stupid idiot has been gettin' disoriented for weeks an' weeks. I never thought to keep an eye on him, make sure he's all right. I'm meant to be the gang's leader… I'm meant to be his brother.\" Suddenly, barks rang out. Dodger, Oliver and Evie all jumped in surprise, and looked around for the source of the noise. Certain that none of the canine voices belonged to Einstein, Dodger quickly lost interest, but Evie was frantic. \"Cool it, toots, you're with me, remember?\" Dodger growled. He got to his feet, ready to move on. Being saddled with a panicking cat was beginning to look like a real hindrance. Oliver was on high alert, listening to pinpoint the location of the strange dogs. He realised that they were close; much too close for comfort. \"Dodge, I don't like this. I can smell them; they're right on us.\" Squealing in terror, Evie scrambled up onto a deeply disgruntled Dodger's back. It felt as though they were surrounded. In the gap between two spring bushes, she could have sworn she caught the flash of dark eyes. They were being watched. \"Chill out! Geez!\" Dodger had had enough, and retreated back into the cover of thick bushes and trees; Evie hanging onto him for dear life and Oliver falling over his own feet in his own hurry to get away. Right now, he didn't much care of the threat those dogs might present, not while Einstein was still vulnerable. Still, he couldn't stick around while Evie was making a scene, and angrily, despite the fact that this part of the park was where he'd last seen Einy, he conceded that it was time to look elsewhere. Away from city lights and the contrasting green cover of the park, Rita searched fruitlessly alongside her sister for most of the night. Occasionally, they checked back with the others in case they'd had any luck, but by the early hours of the morning there was still no news. Farewelling Willow with showers of thanks, Rita retreated to the barge, where she'd be taking her rest break. She was drained, and could not remember her paws ever aching quite so much, but it was difficult to imagine getting any sleep while visions of the worst played constantly around her mind. With every passing hour, Rita's concerns for Einstein's safety had intensified. She had to keep reminding herself that he had always perfectly competent at moving around the city streets and there was no real reason why that evening should have been any different, but it was totally unlike Einstein for him not to come home. She was certain that he must have gotten lost and confused somewhere; the question was whether he was safe, or if in his disoriented state had stumbled into trouble. This late at night, the old dog would be tired and probably scared if he couldn't find his way, and so vulnerable to the countless dangers in the city. It was a long few hours as Rita tried to get some sleep, while remaining aware of any sounds that indicated that someone was approaching. Awoken from a short and unsettled sleep, Rita heard footsteps. After an initial buzz of excitement, it was clear very quickly that it wasn't Einstein, the sounds were all wrong, far too light for a dog of his size. \"Hey Tito,\" she sighed, and got to her feet to greet him. \"Still nothing?\" It was more a statement than a question, but she still hoped that there might be some good news. \"Nah, no sign of him.\" Tito replied, lacking his usually boundless energy. \"Dodger's takin' the cats back home so Jenny doesn't miss them when she gets up.\" It was only then that Rita noticed that the sun was beginning to rise; Einstein had been lost all night. Never had he ever failed to come home to Fagin; something had to be seriously wrong. \"You know, Dodger's not doin' too well, he's takin' it hard.\" Tito said as he settled down to rest. Rita shook her head sadly. \"I guess he's feeling responsible. He sees it as his job to make sure we're all okay, but really none of us took much notice of Einstein getting so muddled in the head.\" She sighed, feeling guilty. \"Einy seemed to be moving around better after the cold weather ended, so I guess it wasn't so obvious that there was anything going on with him.\" She felt a great urge to be at Dodger's side, supporting him in whatever way she could, but knew there was very little she could say or do to make the situation better. Tail hanging low, she headed up the stairs and into the new day. \"I'll see you later, Tito,\" she said gloomily. \"Try and get some sleep, okay?\" The search continued into the next day. Dodger accompanied Fagin to the pound, where it became apparent that Einstein had not been captured. While Dodger was relieved that Einstein had not found himself in such a place, for even the thought was enough to make most dogs shiver, it left them no closer to finding him. The worst case scenarios were seeming more and more likely, or at least it felt that way to the worried gang. By mid-morning, Dodger was exhausted and emotionally drained, but still determined not to give up the search, not even for a rest break. His job was to take care of his family, and he simply couldn't stop until he knew that Einstein was home safe and sound. To contemplate a situation in which he couldn't be found would be just too much to bear, so Dodger kept on trudging the streets, feeling as though he might break down at any moment. \"Dodge? Dodgie?\" He didn't turn around to the sound of Rita's voice, but nuzzled her neck half-heartedly as she sat down beside him. Dodger was aware of Rita studying him closely, trying to ascertain how he was holding up. He made every effort to mask the fear that he was feeling; the moment he let the outward appearance of coping slip would be the moment he'd know that it really was out of his control. A terrible voice in his head reminded him constantly that in reality there was every chance that if something had happened to Einstein that they'd never find him. There were a million places he could be- Einstein could be lying dead somewhere and they'd never know. He knew that everyone else was thinking the same, but no one would voice it. Who'd want to be the one to put that greatest fear into words. \"Come on,\" he said, his tiredness coming through in his voice, \"we gotta keep searchin'.\" They dragged their paws as they wandered, looking back over the same old places over and over again. For hour after gloomy hour, they barely exchanged a word; several times Rita went to speak, to try and reassure Dodger somehow, but she thought better of it. Nothing could be said that would really help anyway. The longer they searched, the bleaker their chances of every finding Einstein alive seemed. The terrible thought plagued Rita's mind, however hard she tried to push it away; how many long days and nights could they keep this up, before accepting that the old dog was gone? \"Dodge, we should meet up with the others, Francis is probably ready for a rest break,\" said Rita gently, determined to focus on making the search a successful one. She licked Dodger's ear, knowing full well that she could only do so much to help him. He needed to sleep, but he was far too hard-headed to admit to it. Dodger nodded. \"Yeah, they're probably waiting for us, it's been a while.\" He turned to head back to the docks and glanced over his shoulder to Rita. She looked completely spent, her eyes lacking the spark of hope he'd seen there just a few hours ago. \"You okay, Rita?\" \"No, not really,\" she sighed, \"You?\" \"I'm tryin' to be,\" Dodger forced a painful smile. He'd already let Einstein down; he was now going to stay strong for the rest of the gang, no matter what. The mates walked home side by side, once again in troubled silence. They came down to the barge, struggling to keep their balance on the rickety trail that led there. Even with all the dreadful fears playing in their minds, to come home gave some comfort. They came into the doorway, and a flash of grey left them both falling to the floor in stunned amazement and relief. Einstein was home at last. \"Hey Dodger man, look what I found!\" Tito yipped, bouncing up and down excitedly. His exclamation was met with deaf ears. Dodger exhaled loudly in surprise and stumbled forward. \"Einy! Where've ya been all this time?\" As if a most enormous weight had been lifted from his chest, he felt he could finally breathe. He laughed, hysterical, as Einstein bounded around him, none the worse for wear and beaming from ear to ear. \"I got lost, then I had a long sleep, and then I found my way home again.\" Einstein said cheerfully. His long, strong tail was wagging wildly. It had been a stressful night, followed by a stressful day, and seeing his old, dear friend after such an ordeal lifted his spirits to no end. It appeared that Dodger, and Rita as well, was just as happy to see him. \"What do you mean you got lost, hon?\" Rita asked, getting over the initial surge of ecstasy and still concerned. Einstein had been through the wringer, and they needed to care for him. \"Were you someplace new, or did you just get confused?\" \"I dunno, it's all a bit fuzzy in my head.\" Einstein's ears drooped slightly. \"Come on, Rita, just drop the interrogation. He's home, what else matters?\" Dodger grumbled, the tight feeling returning to his chest in an instant. In truth, he was deeply worried about how easily Einstein had been getting disorientated, and that it could be the start of a general downward spiral for him, but Dodger was not prepared to talk about it. To do so would mean facing up to the inevitable- Einstein really could not be around for much longer. Besides, Dodger told himself, the old guy was probably exhausted from being out all night, sorting out the problem could wait. \"Would it not be wise to determine the cause of Einstein's misadventure so it may be avoided in the future?\" Francis implored. He'd arrived back at the barge a short while before, ready for a sleep after a long day of searching. All Dodger wanted to do was to just relax knowing that Einstein was safe, to enjoy his being home without having to worry. No chance of that now. He glared at Rita, wishing she could have just let it be, and then turned around to Francis and Tito. \"Guys, can't we just deal with that tomorrow. Some have us haven't slept in ages.\" Rita bristled her hackles angrily. \"Fine, it can wait. Dodge, you know we're only tryin' to help, don't make a fight outta this, not now.\" Opening his mouth to argue, Dodger was distracted by the sounds of footsteps- Fagin was home. In seconds, all five dogs were on top of their master, tails wagging and licking his face and hands joyfully. Fagin threw his arms around Einstein's neck and hugged him tight, the Great Dane squirming with delight as he almost squashed his friend. \"Good to have you back, Einstein!\" Fagin laughed, \"What did you scare us like that for?\" He was thrilled to have him back safe and sound; Einstein had been Fagin's first dog, and first friend in a very long time. While Fagin didn't like to have favourites, he had a special bond with the huge Great Dane and was worried sick at the thought of never seeing him again. As evening came, Dodger watched from a distance as the others gathered around Fagin, entranced by the story as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. He wondered how long they'd have left, just the six of them. Nothing had ever mattered more to him; to Dodger his family was everything and it was his responsibility to look after them. The feeling that he'd failed Einstein was battling the sense that there had not been a thing he could have done to stop the effects of age on his friend. Dodger was not sure which hurt more. He got to his feet, wanting to get away from the painful thoughts that were swirling around his head. \"Dodge?\" Rita had turned to see Dodger leaving. She could tell he was greatly troubled by the whole thing, but felt the same old barriers go back up- Dodger didn't want to reach out to her and there was little she could do about it. Even if Dodger didn't want her support though, she needed his. After the scare they'd all had, Rita wanted the comforting presence of her family near her, but especially her best friend. She looked at him, beseeching. Come on, Dodge. Don't walk away from me now. \"I'm gonna go tell the kid that Einy's home safe. Don't bother waitin' up for me.\" Dodger headed up the steps, desperate to be away from everything that reminded him of his responsibilities and the fact that he was powerless to prevent Einstein's aging and decline. Soon enough, everything that mattered to him was sure to unravel, and he just couldn't face it. Rita watched after him sadly, silently resisting the urge to go after him. Despite knowing that he was upset, she trusted that he'd get home quickly, back to the family that needed him. He was exhausted; he couldn't stay out long if he wanted to, she was sure of it. Until then, she'd just wait quietly, and try to get her own head around what had happened. Out in the cool evening air, Dodger was relieved to find himself alone, and the need to put on a brave face gone. He had to unwind somehow, all the fear and the stress was getting all too much for him. Anything to escape from what he was faced with, to forget. By the time Dodger arrived at Oliver's place the sun had almost completely gone down. He barked outside the window, and the young cat responded quickly, eager for news. \"Hey kid, good news- he's home.\" Dodger grinned, his spirits lifted immediately at seeing Oliver. Landing down on the pavement, Oliver's face lit up as his worries left him. \"Really? That's great! What happened?\" \"Dunno, I guess he just got lost. He found his own way back eventually. I knew he would, Einstein knows what he's doin'.\" Oliver was well aware that Dodger's assurance was feigned, but said nothing of it. \"Thanks for letting me know; you guys must be pretty tired after all that, I'm surprised you're not home sleeping.\" He thought he saw Dodger's expression harden, but brushed it off as just his imagination. \"The others are probably sleepin' by now, but I'm stayin' out tonight. I need to get away from it all and just have a good time, no responsibilities, ya know?\" Dodger stretched out casually. \"You can come along, I'll show ya how to have a real good time.\" \"Thanks Dodge, but I think I'll give it a miss. I'm pretty tired after last night. Maybe some other time, right?\" Dodger was disappointed, but didn't show it. He figured that it would probably be easier to enjoy himself without a kid to take care of anyway, especially if he wanted to let himself unwind in female company. \"Sure, I can find the time.\" He winked, and started on his way. \"I'm gonna hold ya to it though.\" \"Dodger, you say 'hello' to Einstein for me when you get back, okay?\" \"Yeah, 'course, kid.\" Dodger said, looking back over his shoulder, \"See ya 'round.\" He moved on, back towards the docks, but past the turn he have taken to go back to the barge. The sounds of dogs filled the air as he approached the abandoned warehouse. As with most nights, there were many dogs off the streets getting together to let loose and have it all hang out. There was surely no better place in the city for a dog to go to pick up women, and the thought was just too inviting. No responsibilities to anyone, nothing at all to worry about, in fact, except for ensuring that he himself had a good time. He forced himself to push his fears for the future out of his mind. What could be the harm in forgetting about it all, just for one night? It was all a bit of fun, just what he needed to get his head back where it should be. Coolly, he made his entrance, with rhythm in his step and an arrogant smirk on his face. Suddenly, faced with the freedom, the escape he was now craving, he felt wide awake; sleep deprivation, if anything, only added to his recklessness. Tonight, The Dodge was going to take this party by storm.[Chapter 15] The hours dragged on, but still Dodger had not returned home. The stress of the past day had left everyone exhausted, and by this point Einstein, Francis, Tito and Fagin were fast asleep. While they had wondered where Dodger had got to, they were not particularly worried; it wasn't unusual for him to come home late or even not at all. Still, Rita lay awake, getting more and more concerned and angry. The whole incident with Einstein had been very confronting, and she was shaken. Didn't Dodger realise that she needed him now? Why was he not supporting his family when things had gotten difficult? She was almost resentful of how easily the others had managed to doze off, seemingly without a care. Rita felt alone, and frightened by the turn of events, knowing that it was a sure sign that things were changing. Without Dodger's reassuring presence, it all just got magnified in her head. She wanted him to be there for her, and she wanted so much to be there for him. Through her growing anger towards him, Rita couldn't help but worry; Dodger hadn't slept in two days, and whatever he wanted to show, he was clearly in some measure of distress. In a state like that, it would only be too easy for an over-confident dog to come into trouble. Dodger approached the barge, feeling ill. Everything had spiralled out of control incredibly fast and he was left wishing that none of it had ever happened. It had started well enough. He knew the best place for a good time late at night was the old warehouse by the docks where Willow lived; most nights it was crawling with street dogs. Those who gathered there were of a similar mindset; a simple desire to have fun, however wild the party might get. It was always a little awkward when he caught eye contact with the eternally miserable Willow, but he could easily shrug it off and get on with what he came there for. He'd been in a room upstairs, against the window with a handsome if distinctly scruffy sheepdog-mix bitch. Dodger had already had the pleasure of getting close to this shepherd's friend, and was now far removed from the weight of responsibility and stress that had been weighing him down. In the heat of the moment, all he could take in was the feel of that woman, her scent, and the chills that were going through his own body. And then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw on the dock below a flash of a figure that made his blood run cold. He pulled away hastily, feeling his proud confidence falling away from beneath him. The bitch cooed. \"What's the matter, sugar?\" Dodger stumbled from the window, shaking. That the sheepdog had even spoken was lost on him. The haunting familiarity of the figure he'd seen struck him. He was near certain he'd just laid eyes on his mother; the mother who'd abandoned him for no reason other than that he was an inconvenience. Not uttering a word to what had been a lover for the night, Dodger took himself down the stairs, taking care not to fall over has his legs shook beneath him. His breath caught in his throat as he came to the bottom. The memory was now seared on Dodger's mind, and he couldn't let it go. Looking away had been a great struggle, transfixed as he'd been by what he knew was the woman who'd turned his young life to turmoil. What had struck him most was just how much like him his mother appeared to be. The way she teased the men that surrounded her was alarmingly similar to his own self-serving womanising tendencies. But, he desperately tried to tell himself, that didn't make him like her in any way that really mattered, Dodger would never abandon a vulnerable and dependent family member as she'd done to him all that time ago. With that horrible surprise encounter, his night out had become a huge mess, an awful mistake, and the reality of what he'd done finally dawned on him. He'd been far too desperate to escape from his responsibilities and the fear he felt to even consider all that he might be risking by having that one night of meaningless fun with whoever would have him. It hadn't helped anyhow, he now felt worse than ever. Dodger's stomach was tying itself in knots at the thought of facing Rita, but it couldn't be avoided, there was no point even trying to hide what he'd been up to. It hadn't been the first time he'd been with another woman since they'd gotten together, but with everyone so strung out over Einstein, him doubted very much whether Rita would be in the frame of mind to just shrug it off as nothing. The more he thought about it, the more it dawned on him that she'd been distressed, and silently crying out for him to comfort her. Dodger felt a cold shame from deep within. All he could do was hope that it would all blow over quickly. Hearing the creaking of footsteps on the stairs, Rita lifted her head expectantly. Though she was angry that Dodger had just deserted them when he was needed, it was a relief to know that he was fine. Upset as he'd been, she couldn't help but worry about him. She got up to greet her mate. \"Where've you been, Dodger? You know I needed you- we all did. Or did you forget that you're meant to be the leader round here?\" As she came closer she noticed a change to his scent; the smell of other dogs was all over him… and definitely female. Her expression hardened in disgust, and Dodger grimaced. His reaction all but confirmed what she feared to be true, and she felt her heart drop like a lead balloon. \"It didn't mean nothin', I promise you. I needed to escape from it all, that's all it was.\" he whispered back, trying to retain a cool composure. \"Did you even give me a second thought? You're not the only one struggling with all this, Dodger!\" Rita was furious, but tried to keep it in check, knowing that the others were sleeping. \"You left me to deal with all this while you're fooling around with other women- do you have any idea how much that hurts?\" \"Look, I'm sorry. I had a moment of weakness and it just went way too far. Really, you can't feel worse about this than I do, if I could go back and undo it I would.\" Rita scoffed. \"Yeah, I bet you had a lousy time,\" she snarled, \"Why don't you tell me all about it? How many was it? I know you've had more than one tonight, I can smell it on you. So how was it, baby? Picked up any pointers you can give me?\" \"Hey, don't be like that. When did you get so uptight about being exclusive anyhow?\" Dodger asked, hoping that he could cool Rita off. He knew he couldn't claim innocence, but after the night he'd had, there was only so much insult he could take. \"I don't believe you,\" Rita hissed, struggling to keep her voice down when she wanted to scream at him, \"You knew that I was upset. The only person you care about is yourself,\" She knew that it wasn't completely true, but tired and emotionally over-wrought, she wasn't in a state to hold herself back. \"As long as you can get your kicks, it doesn't matter what anyone else is feeling. I have made so many excuses for you, just shrugged it off whenever you'd make eyes at another a woman, I accepted that you didn't want to feel tied down, I tried to be understanding- what more do you want from me? You know what, I don't even care what you want anymore. We're through.\" Suddenly panicking as he realised that his relationship with Rita was falling apart, Dodger moved closer, but his attempt to smooth things over with a loving nuzzle was met with a dangerous glare. \"Rita, I love you, you know that. It won't happen again, I swear.\" He looked to where the others were sleeping, nervously, hoping that they wouldn't wake to hear what was going on. \"Just forget it, Dodger,\" Rita fought back tears; the last thing she wanted was to let Dodger see her cry. She headed back to her bed, it wasn't the time or place to let things escalate further. \"You know, I never thought you'd let me down, not like this. Guess I'm as stupid as you are thoughtless.\" She lay down, facing into her bed, not wanting to see him. \"Hey! You don't get to just say it's over and then walk away!\" Dodger demanded, unable to believe that she could turn her back on him with such ease. \"I'm not giving up on us; how can you finish it so quick? You said you loved me, that you wanted me, if that was true you would fight for what we've got.\" Angrily, Rita turned behind her, glaring Dodger down. \"So you think I deserve to be treated like I don't even matter? That's not love, it's just convenient for you to have me around when no one else will have you.\" \"Rita, that's a load of…\" Rita snarled. \"If you don't back off right now, I'm getting out of here. I don't want to talk to you, I don't want to see you, and I don't want to hear you. I promise you, I will walk right out!\" Incensed that she could think so little of him, Dodger nevertheless took a step back, leaving Rita to calm down in her own time. Her words had been driven into him like knives, making the tender moments they'd share together feel like lies. Dodger stared after her, feeling lost, before heading over to his own bed. What on earth had just happened? Rita found herself shaking as she tried to settle. It was all she could do not to start sobbing; but she would not let Dodger hear her cry. She could hardly believe that it had all gone so wrong, and that all the trust she'd had in her most treasured friend had been lost. Images of Dodger getting close to faceless, nameless strangers swirled around her mind as she closed her eyes. All she had wanted was for him to stay close, to be the friend he was supposed to be. Surely, that wasn't asking too much? Even after all that they'd shared, she wasn't enough for him when the going got tough, and it cut deeply. If he was going to treat her like garbage, then Rita would be better off without him. Hot, silent tears ran down her cheeks as she settled in for a lonely night. Gazing over from beside his bed, Dodger thought desperately for some way to fix things, but with no ideas forthcoming, lay down and tried to get comfortable. He thought of his mother, the image etched onto his mind, refusing to leave him alone. Maybe he was just like her after all- selfish, arrogant, thoughtless. He'd abandoned his family when they really needed him, how different could he be from the mother who'd left him as a tiny pup? Dodger promised himself that he wouldn't let them down again; if Einstein was going downhill, he'd be there all the way. The gang was his responsibility, and somehow he'd just have to learn to handle the hard times that inevitably lay ahead. He whined, deeply troubled, and looked back over towards Rita's bed. He knew she was crying, and it was hard to stop himself from going to her side to make it all better, every urge in him told him to go to her. His best intentions simply couldn't make it all better, not now. Rita was the only person he'd ever spoken to about his abandonment by his mother, and being cut off from her while he was drowning in turmoil. For all his need to keep up the appearance of supreme coolness, it had always been good to have her to confide in when he needed it. But that was gone now, and he could only blame himself. After years spent flitting between women with not so much as a care, none of that could compare to what he'd had with Rita. She meant the world to him, really she always had, and knowing that he'd hurt her for the sake of one night of 'freedom' left Dodger feeling disgusted with himself. All he could do was hope that her vicious anger towards him would subside once the stress of the past days was put behind her. They'd have to work through it… somehow. Rita woke early the next morning, and for a moment forgot about the events of the night before. She sighed as it all came flooding back, and couldn't bring herself to get up and face Dodger. She couldn't hear the others, presumably they were still asleep, and she made up her mind to stay quietly in bed until it would be easier to avoid being alone with her now former mate. Despite all the hurt she felt, Rita was keen to put her issues with Dodger to one side, at least until she knew Einstein was all right. Hearing heavy footsteps, she decided it was safe to get up. \"Morning Einy, you sleep okay?\" she asked, her tone as upbeat as she could muster. \"Yeah, I was real tired after being lost so long. It sure is good to be home.\" Einstein glanced over to Dodger's bed. \"See, I told you Dodger would come home! You worry too much.\" Rita tried to remain cheerful for Einstein's sake, \"I guess so. Maybe I wouldn't worry if you didn't disappear on us like that. We'll try and avoid that in the future, huh?\" \"That sounds good, it wasn't much fun.\" \"We won't let it happen again, I promise. It shouldn't be too hard to keep sight of you, you're not exactly small.\" She smiled and stretched out, before turning back to him, \"You are all right though?\" \"Yes, I'm fine, just happy to be home.\" Einstein wagged his tail. Rita was relieved that he was none the worse for the ordeal, Einstein was never really one to fret or mope but it was still a lot for him to go through. She still felt guilt for not taking better care of him as he entered his twilight years, and was determined to be the supportive friend he deserved from now on. His positive attitude reassured her that it would all be fine, it would maybe just take a little adjustment. At least that was one less thing to worry about. Rita looked back over to where Dodger was sleeping and frowned. With the feeling of betrayal refusing to let her go, she knew that the breakdown in their relationship might not be such an easy fix. But could she really sever the bond that her life had been so greatly influenced by? Tired and hurting, Rita just didn't know.[Chapter 16] With a full day without the time to find anything to eat behind them, the gang were up and out in the city early, forced to ignore the strong desire to sleep in after all the drama. As they headed out on the back of Fagin's tricycle, there was an uncomfortable silence between Dodger and Rita as each avoided making eye contact with the other. They'd managed not to speak to one another up to that point, helped largely by the fact that Einstein was still the centre of attention. With all that had happened, Rita figured it best to avoid a public confrontation, but at the same time she dreaded getting Dodger alone and having to face the issue. Judging by his avoidance of her, he was clearly not keen on the idea either. \"Okay troops, we're gonna have to split up, it'll be easier to find food that way.\" Dodger remained upbeat, not wanting give the impression of anything being amiss. He had a an image to keep up. \"Einstein, you stick with me today, best avoid a repeat of your misadventure, huh?\" As they started to go their separate ways, Rita forced herself to turn back around. \"Dodger, we need to talk,\" she said. \"I know you've been avoiding me, and if I'm honest I don't want to talk to you right now, but we gotta try and sort this out.\" \"Einy, just wait here. I'll just be a few minutes, okay?\" Dodger said quietly, before turning back to Rita. Her expression was stony, just as it had been during the fiery confrontation the night before. \"Are you two all right? You seem kind of sad.\" Einstein asked, worried. \"Hey, you know me. I'm fine.\" Dodger managed a smirk, which soon faded as he walked over to where Rita was waiting for him. \"You doin' okay, hot stuff?\" \"What do you think?\" she growled, \"I don't think you have any idea how worried I was last night… and you couldn't 'a cared less about me. I just don't get it; if nothing else, we're meant to be friends.\" \"Friends screw up, ya know. I'm sorry, and I don't know how many times I gotta say it.\" Dodger said, the usual smugness completely absent from his voice. \"I just felt helpless. I couldn't face it- I'd never even given it a second thought, Einstein getting old an'…\" He shook his head sadly. \"Rita, I was terrified of losing him, and knowing I had no control at all. You guys mean everything to me, and it's my job to take care of you. I was scared, and I wanted to just forget about all of it. I thought I'd feel better if I could have a good time- no responsibilities, just a bit of fun. It went too far- I know it went too far, and I'm so sorry for doing that to you.\" He looked up to her, desperate to make her understand. \"I know you're sorry,\" Rita said, \"And I know how stressed out you were over Einy; I sorta get why you'd want to just escape from everything, but you hurt me real bad, Dodge. You didn't have to go so far; you obviously didn't even give me a second thought, and it's hard for me to get past that. I want us to get through this, but I'm gonna need some time.\" Dodger nodded, understanding. It was a relief that Rita had cooled down somewhat since he came home the night before, but he knew that it would take a lot to repair the damage. Trust had been broken on both sides. \"Guess I'll see ya later then?\" \"Yeah,\" Rita turned to leave, still feeling miserable. \"See ya round.\" As soon as Dodger was out of sight, Rita broke into a run, stretching her legs properly after a restless night. Any ill-feeling within her was exacerbated by hunger; it was small wonder she was exhausted. Rita was grateful for the distraction of the hustle and bustle all around her, the morning was buzzing with noise and activity. Feeling a part of it all lifted her spirits. Scrounging through rubbish bins, she quickly managed to find scraps of food to keep her hunger at bay, at least a little, but never anything substantial enough to be worth taking home to the others. However hard she tried to busy herself though, the events of the night before would not leave her mind. In the cold light of day, she realised that she'd been cruel in her words towards Dodger, fuelled by her own fears and distress. He'd wronged her for sure, but she too had caused hurt. Rita wished she didn't care so much for her former mate, but it was not something that could be switched off overnight. If anything, though, the guilt made her feel even angrier toward Dodger; she hadn't deserved to be pushed to her limits. An opportunity to steal a fast food burger left unattended came about, and Rita was instantly in focus-mode. The more she ate, the better she'd feel, so it seemed that meal would be invaluable. Striking swiftly, she seized the burger, box and all, in her slender but strong jaws. She leapt into the moving traffic, making a quick escape. Tired and holding onto grief and turmoil, her usual precision was lacking, and she misjudged a jump. Rita yelped as her shoulder caught a car mirror with a loud smack, throwing her careening to the asphalt. She rolled over her head and neck, narrowly avoiding a deadly collision with a car that blasted its horn as it swerved past. With a gasp of pain and shock, she scrambled back to her feet, and out of harm's way. Shaken, Rita retreated down the next street, where she huddled down and cried. There was no escaping the enormity of the loss she was feeling. All she could do was to go easy on herself; getting her head around all this would take time, as would finding some way of moving forward. In many ways, that hard knock was exactly what she needed; Rita was reminded that she had to let herself feel the grief and hurt, but she was tough, a hardened survivor, and she wouldn't let any amount of heartache take that strength from her. \"You really need to keep a tighter leash on that mutt of yours.\" Willow called snidely, a cruel smirk on her face as she watched Rita approach. Living at the warehouse as she did, she was well aware of Dodger's misstep, and the urge to say 'I told you so' was strong. \"I didn't ask for your opinion,\" Rita snapped. She'd expected Willow to be gloating, in fact, she'd have been shocked if there was any refrain from barbed comments at all. That did not mean, however, that Rita was about to lie down and take it- she had enough garbage to deal with in her life without putting up from it from Willow. \"I don't want to talk about it, Will,\" she said firmly, \"I just wanted to thank you for helping us out the other night. It meant a lot.\" Willow's expression softened; ultimately, she respected Rita's dedication to her elder friend. \"You found Einstein then?\" \"Yeah, he came home of his own accord yesterday afternoon.\" Rita replied, quietly relieved that the issue of her love life had been dropped. \"He's tired obviously, and I think from now on he's not gonna be roaming around on his own, but he's fine.\" \"Glad to hear it.\" \"Hey Willow, if you're not up to much, do you want to just hang out?\" Rita asked quietly, feeling uncomfortable such a suggestion, with the relationship she shared with Willow being rocky as it was. \"I could really use the company.\" Willow was taken aback but pleased. She wagged her tail, giving away her delight. \"Sure, as long as we can keep away from that human of yours. I guess you're not wanting to be around Dodger right now, huh? Rita tensed up angrily. She wasn't so desperate for company that she'd put up with poorly described jabs about her crumbling relationship. \"I told you, just leave it. If you just want to pick a fight I'll be happy enough on my own.\" \"No, you're right,\" Willow said hurriedly, knowing she'd pushed her luck about as far as would be tolerated. \"I won't bring it up again.\" \"Good. Let's get goin' then, I've had hardly anything to eat all day.\" By late afternoon, Rita and Willow had achieved very little in their search for food, though Rita had managed to swipe a purse from the back of a pram, much to the distaste of her sister who gave her a firm, but entirely ignored, lecture on how morally wrong it is to steal. Still, such disagreements kept Rita's mind from wandering back to Dodger, and it made the day easier to get through. As they turned into a quiet alley, Rita was surprised to see a familiar face. \"Good afternoon, ladies,\" Francis said cheerfully, looking up from the pile of rubbish that he'd been snuffling and sifting through. Tito ran out from the overturned trash can, eager to get a load of the women to whom Francis was talking. He was rather disappointed to see that it was only Rita, and not a potential date. \"So much for splitting up.\" Rita scoffed, wagging her tail. \"You guys found much?\" \"Yeah man, check it out!\" Tito excitedly dropped a tatty watch at her feet. \"Still tickin' and everything!\" \"It's not particularly useful though, is it?\" Francis sniffed. \"Fagin has several already, I don't imagine this is any less worthless than the others.\" Tito immediately flew into a rage. \"What have you got, Francis?\" Rita asked, with an appreciative glance back to Willow who was holding Tito down with her paw. The bulldog immediately became very flustered. \"Oh, well, u-unfortunately my search has not been, well, terribly fruitful…\" he mumbled uncomfortably. \"You're not exactly in a position to give Tito a hard time, Frankie.\" Rita grumbled, while Francis blanched under her withering gaze. Tito managed to pull himself free and bounced back over. He sniffed at the purse that Rita had dropped to the ground. \"Whoa man, it's not empty! Fagin's gonna be real happy!\" \"I guess so, but we've still gotta bring some food home.\" \"Well, if you are in need of my dramatic services I am more than happy to oblige.\" Francis said proudly. Rita thought for a moment. Having Francis around to provide a distraction certainly opened up a lot more opportunities to steal something more substantial than the scraps she'd been picking on all day. She knew that Willow would not very much appreciate their going near to crowds of people, but they had to eat. \"All right, it's worth a shot.\" The four of them continued on, into busier parts of the city. The activity all around them made Willow nervous- in the year or so that she'd been living on the streets, she'd always made sure to keep away from humans as much as possible and very rarely strayed far from the docks around which she lived. The noise was overwhelming. She walked close to Rita, trusting her just enough to keep going, even as her body trembled with anxiety. Their ears pricked to the sounds of diners eating outdoors at a restaurant. The smells that wafted towards them were wonderful, and served to emphasise the hunger that they all felt. Rita dropped the purse to the ground, as Tito gave a most ravenous groan. \"Willow, you mind keeping hold of our stuff while we work?\" Rita asked her sister, who was still clearly out of her element. Willow nodded, but did not look impressed, \"More thieving. Really? And to think I ever looked up to you.\" \"Since when did you care so much about humans?\" Rita said, exasperated. \"No one's gonna make you join in, but I'm not going to apologise for surviving the best way that I can.\" \"Hey, if they're eatin' at a fancy place like this, they can afford to share a meal.\" Tito piped up, bouncing on the spot, eager to get started. He'd eaten nothing more than tasteless old scraps all day, and nothing and no-one could dampen his enthusiasm now. Willow said nothing, but looked at Rita disapprovingly as she gathered up the purse and watch in her mouth and turned to find a hiding spot a short way away. At least, she thought, she had an excuse to get away from the heavy threat of human interference. Rita shook her head; there was no point in trying to reach an understanding with her sister. They could enjoy some more bonding time later, but unlike Willow, she had a responsibility to a family. \"Okay, Francis, let's see what you've got,\" she grinned, choosing to ignore her sister's attitude. Francis proudly stepped up, and ran into the midst of the diners, crashing into chairs and tables as he went for maximum effect. Once he'd gained the full attention of his startled audience, he collapsed to the ground, moaning and groaning in apparent agony. Several diners leapt up to try and assist the 'dying' dog, leaving their table exposed and vulnerable, immediately catching the attention of Rita and Tito, who seized the opportunity to help themselves. They made a quick getaway, carrying with them a lamb shank and a large steak. It wasn't an easy feat in Tito's case due to his small size, but he was well practiced, and not one to be defeated. Francis followed a short way behind them, leaving the confused, and soon to be furious, diners wondering what on earth had just taken place. Rita loved the thrill of it all; really Willow did not know what she was missing. They kept running, past where Willow had been waiting for them, until Rita was satisfied they'd put a safe distance between themselves and their victims. She grinned as she threw down the piece of lamb. Between the three of them -Willow stubbornly refused to eat the stolen goods and no one felt any desire to encourage her otherwise-, Rita, Tito and Francis polished off the lamb in a matter of minutes. It was very tasty and met with a great deal of enthusiasm. Unfortunately, it really did not go far between the three dogs, but they'd already decided to that the other piece of meat would be taken home for Dodger and Einstein. Rita lay down and watched Tito and Francis fighting over the bone that remained of their meal. The thought of returning home to the barge filled her with dread. She'd enjoyed being out, working, and just being a part of something alive and constantly moving, leaving no time to wallow in sadness over her failing relationship with Dodger. The city healed her wounds, at least while she was submerged into it. Back home, it would all come flooding back; she would no longer be the hard, capable survivor, but a lonely victim, let down by the person she most cared for. Willow interrupted Rita's thoughts, gently nudging her shoulder. \"I'm going to head home now, I'll see you round sometime.\" The skinny hound made eye contact with her sister. \"I know it won't make everything better, but I'm here if you need someone.\" Shaking herself to the present, Rita gave Willow a genuine smile. \"Okay, bye Willie. Thanks by the way, for the company.\" \"No problem. Catch you tomorrow maybe\" Willow headed off, without so much as a glance or a word to the other two, who were of little interest to her. Francis glanced up at the darkening sky, then back down to look at Rita enquiringly. \"Should we not be making haste towards home ourselves? It is getting rather late.\" To his surprise, she grimaced in clear discomfort. \"You guys mind if we stay out just a little bit longer?\" Rita asked with a barely disguised sigh. She had been reluctant to talk to the others about what had happened, but was desperate to stay out even just a little while more. Out here, she was in control- some old Rita she'd always been, back home, everything felt wrong. \"Things aren't so great between Dodger and me right now. I just want a bit more time to be away from it all.\" \"What? What happened?\" Tito exclaimed, surprised, \"Since when are you not all over him like fleas on a pound dog?\" Rita stiffened, but allowed herself to open up. These guys were family, and if she couldn't talk to them, it didn't say much about her. \"He cheated on me, last night when I was upset about Einy,\" she said quietly, \"It was with strangers and not anything serious, but I can't say it's not a kick in the guts.\" \"He did wha-?\" Tito jumped to his feet, shouting in a rage, \"He's gonna wish he never even laid eyes on another woman when I'm done with him! You messin' with my sister, you messin' with me, man!\" \"Tito!\" Rita snapped, immediately regretting the decision to open up. \"You keep outta this, I don't need anyone fighting my corner. Don't you even think about startin' something.\" She glared the Chihuahua down, hoping that he'd have the intelligence to refrain from interfering. He wasn't one for missing any opportunity to start trouble, but Rita was not having it. Francis looked at her, concerned by her clear distress. \"Of course there is no rush to get home. If there is anything you need, we are more than happy to be of assistance.\" Put in his place, Tito had calmed down somewhat. \"You wanna just hang out for a few more hours? Have a bit of fun to take your mind off it?\" Rita smiled appreciatively, and pulled Tito with her forepaws, into a playful hug. This was what she wanted from them, not righteous anger on her behalf. \"Right, you're on,\" she said as she grappled with the squirming Chihuahua who gnawed at her legs. Stashing away their loot in a secret spot for later, they trotted back into the thick of the action. Despite everything, Rita almost felt light and content inside. The support of her friends meant the world, and she could think of nothing she'd rather do than to run and laugh amid the city lights with them beside her. The feeling would not last, but she'd hold onto it while she could.[Chapter 17] Rita returned home to the barge after a morning of hard work, ready for a quick rest before back to Willow. Over a week had passed since Einstein's misadventure, and the tension between Dodger and Rita was still holding up. The distraction of working the streets was welcome for Rita as she'd been feeling increasingly isolated. Not that it was anyone's intention, but it wasn't easy to avoid Dodger without avoiding everyone else for a lot of the time as well; he always seemed to be at the centre of their world. Rita spent more and more time off on her own, or more closely following Fagin around. She wondered how long she could keep it up; the loneliness was starting to get to her, but she still struggled to get past the hurt. At least Fagin enjoyed having her close; she'd spent the most part of the morning riding around in the back of the scooter and throwing herself wholeheartedly into her work whenever they stopped somewhere. Despite the recent drama between Dodger and Rita, things were actually pretty good, and it had been a good while since they'd gone without food, and Fagin was very upbeat and positive as a result. Having successfully brought her master some decent loot, Rita was keen to spend time with her sister, the only dog whom she hadn't drifted away from. Quite the contrary, they were closer than they'd been since they were small pups, largely thanks to the fact that, for the time being at least, Rita wasn't particularly bothered by Willow's strong dislike of Dodger. Willow was perfectly happy with the current arrangement, and as long as she kept a lid on the outright gloating, Rita was content to enjoy her company. Rita came down the stairs and noticed a few flowers lying by her bed. They appeared to have been roughly pulled from the dirt somewhere, perhaps from someone's garden, as bits of soil were hanging from the ends. She sniffed at the gift Dodger had left her. He wasn't really the type for romantic gestures, but it seemed he was trying. A few cruddy flowers would do nothing to rebuild Rita's trust in him though, all it meant was that he was feeling guilty, and so, Rita thought, he should. He wasn't the only one though; it was hard to let go of the feeling that she herself had hurt a friend. Pushing the flowers aside, Rita lay down in her bed, and started chewing on a bagel that she'd picked up on the way home. It was a chance to really think about her present situation, which she knew couldn't continue on like this. Rita hated to see Dodger hurting, and she hated that it bothered her in the slightest after what he'd done. It was hard for her to get a grip on her true feelings for him; one minute she pitied him for how deeply he'd been shaken by that scare over Einstein and wanting to be there for him as a friend, but then the next, she couldn't get over his apparent lack of care for his family and his supposed mate when his presence was needed. No one else seemed all that hung up on that side of things; all the other guys could see was that Dodger had been unfaithful, but to Rita that wasn't what had hurt the most. She kept her distance where she could, and spoke to him only in regards to work or anything that really couldn't be avoided. The creaking of paws on the steps alerted Rita to the presence of someone coming home. Tito, she thought, as the sounds were not loud enough to be the much heavier Francis, Einstein or Dodger. \"Hello? Anyone home?\" called Oliver into the quiet barge. Surprised, Rita looked up from her bagel, \"Oh hey, kid. Just me right now, the guys are still out.\" Oliver padded over and rubbed his face affectionately against Rita's shoulder. She looked happier for it. \"I just wanted to see how you guys were all going- especially Einstein.\" \"He's fine. He's getting old, that's all. Einstein's happy enough, not really bothered by it, but it is going to get tough.\" \"What about Dodger?\" Oliver asked earnestly, \"He seemed really weird when I saw him last.\" Rita's face clouded over. \"Don't worry about him. Dodger's been worryin' about Einy, and sulking because I've had enough of dealing with his garbage. He'll get over it.\" She changed her tone, noting the troubled look on Oliver's face, \"I was actually going to head out now; my sister's expecting me. If you want to come along too, you're welcome- unless you'd rather stick around and see if Dodger makes an appearance. There's gonna be a load of other dogs where I'm going, but you'd be safe as long as you're with me.\" \"Sure, I'll come along with you,\" Oliver said, \"I'm not scared of dogs.\" \"Just watch you don't get too overconfident, kid. Plenty of dogs out there wouldn't think twice before turnin' ya into mincemeat,\" said Rita darkly, \"you're gonna want to keep your wits about you.\" It appeared that the young cat still had an excess of bravado, probably as a result of hanging around with Dodger all the time. The facts of the matter were simple though, Oliver lived a sheltered life as a pet, and tough cookie or not, he'd still be easy pickings. Oliver grinned, full of himself, \"I know, I know. But if I can take on Roscoe and DeSoto, this will be a piece of cake.\" Rita shook her head, half concerned by Oliver's underestimation of what was a dangerous world for a cat, and half amused by the cockiness that he'd picked up from Dodger somewhere along the way. \"Maybe… but don't go round these sorts of places on your own, got that? I don't want a dead cat on my conscience.\" She stretched out and got to her feet. \"Come on, you can ride on my back, it will be quicker. The two of them set out, Oliver riding happily on Rita's back. He hung on especially tight as Rita clambered up from the barge to the sturdier docks, not wanting to fall into the cold water below. They kept going, past Sykes' old warehouse, into a dark and grimy corner in which several run-down buildings stood. A smell of dog and damp hung in the air, far stronger than back at the barge, and Oliver became slightly tense. In front of the largest building, a warehouse, a shaggy brown dog stood on guard. \"Just over there, Ollie.\" Rita shook her head toward the old building, \"A load of us hang out round there, street dogs from all over. My sister's been living here about a year now; a few of them do, but mostly dogs come and go.\" Oliver looked over with great curiosity, but was pleased to have the security of Rita's back as a vantage point. \"Your sister's the one who was helping you look for Einstein, right?\" \"Yes, that's her. I gotta warn you, she's not the friendliest person you're ever going to meet. She won't hurt you, but she's pretty messed up,\" Rita said with a sigh. \"It's not her fault; she's had a real hard life- just don't take it personally if she doesn't give you a warm welcome. It's the way she is, that's all.\" \"That's okay, I'm used to rudeness- I live with Georgette, remember?\" Oliver said, and Rita chuckled in response. The shaggy brown dog scoffed as Rita walked past. \"So the rumours are true, then? You better keep a close eye on your little pet if you're taking him in with you.\" Rita just offered the dog a glance and kept going. Oliver gripped tighter to Rita's back as she slipped through the door which was hanging on its hinges… suddenly he didn't feel so brave. The first room was full of dogs- nine, Oliver counted. Rita kept on through the next room and up the stairs; it was quieter up there, away from most of the canine inhabitants. Willow lifted her head from where she lay, and she frowned as she noticed the extra baggage Rita had brought along. \"What's this?\" asked Willow, moodily. \"Guess I better introduce you properly. This is Oliver. Kid, this is my sister, Willow.\" \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Oliver brightly. Willow was not impressed. No sooner than she'd finally been enjoying some quality time with Rita already there was this stupid cat muscling in on things. \"He came round to see us but no one else was home, it wouldn't have been right to just ditch him for your sake,\" explained Rita. She didn't expect Willow to be all that nice to Oliver, but hoped that she could at least not be hostile. Willow sniffed at the cat and then sat back, still slightly put out. \"We're not going to be able to go far with him following along behind, he's only got little legs. You don't want to be carrying that lump around all afternoon.\" There was that rudeness I'd been warned about , thought Oliver. Rita shrugged. \"I'm happy to hang around here for a while, but I got no problem with taking the kid out, I'm sure he'd keep up.\" After a morning's work, Rita was more than happy to kick back and chill out, and she lay down beside Willow. Oliver slid down from her back and looked around curiously. It was a dark and dingy place. There were two other dogs in there; one sleeping in a corner, softly snoring, and another who was lying alert, his eyes drifting over to them every now and then. It was a little unnerving. A third dog came through the door, taking the second's attention away from Oliver, which was a relief to the cat. Looking away from the intimidating stranger, Oliver zoned back into Rita and Willow's conversation. \"I hear that ridgeback, Leo's been around this place in the past few days,\" Willow was saying, \"If you want a bit of rebound action, I know he'd go for it. You two had a thing one time, didn't you? \"I'm not interested in seeing other guys, Willow,\" Rita growled, getting annoyed, \"And yes, we had a thing. More than once actually. But that doesn't matter, 'cause I really don't feel like getting involved with anyone right now.\" Unperturbed, Willow carried on. \"You don't have to be involved as such, just a little bit of fun to make you feel better. Come on, he's hot and you know it- and there's plenty of guys around if you're after something different.\" Rita scoffed, \"You think a bit of harmless fun is the solution here? Worked out well for a friend of mine, didn't it?\" She wasn't keen to openly put Dodger down in front of Oliver, it just wouldn't be fair, but it was hard with Willow pushing buttons. \"You're free and single. Why don't you go chat someone up? Like you said, Leo's fairly easy on the eyes.\" That shut Willow up. She was not the type to talk to strangers- let alone make flirtatious advances, and Rita knew it. Finally getting the hint that Rita still didn't want to talk about her love life, Willow moved the conversation on, sharing all the latest gossip she'd picked up from lurking around the warehouse. They chatted happily for a long while- though any input from Oliver was completely ignored by Willow. While Rita called her out on it, there was no way Willow would take kindly to sharing the closest thing she had to a friend with some pampered cat. In contrast to Willow's response to him, Oliver's presence caught the attention of other dogs passing through without fail; some lifted a lip in a growl before moving on, others teased and catcalled Rita, and the odd few were simply intrigued and interested in the novelty of an unusual visitor to the warehouse. Rita noticed the large dog on the other side of the room gazing at Oliver as he had been doing before. Something about the way he looked at him made her uncomfortable, it was strangely sinister, unlike even the glares given by other disapproving canines. \"We should go out and get some fresh air,\" she said, wanting to get away from that dog who was giving her the creeps, \"You probably need to get home soon, won't you, Oliver?\" \"Yeah, I don't want to miss Jenny,\" the cat replied. Willow frowned moodily. As far as she was concerned, the little furball had all but ruined the time she was supposed to be spending one on one with her sister. \"I can come with you some of the way, but I won't be going near his house.\" She gave Oliver a filthy look. \"If you really have to, Willie,\" Rita said, \"Just try and be nice to the poor kid. He's not doin' you any harm.\" Rita and Oliver moved quickly, not wanting Jenny to come home to find a cat missing. Willow sulkily carried on behind, becoming rather moody as she felt left out of the conversation the other two were having. As they came close, Willow stopped to wait in a safe, quiet alley, not wanting to get too near to humans. It wasn't too long a wait before Rita was back. Willow rushed to her, but slowed down at the sight of the frown on her sister's face. \"You know, you can't go treatin' people like that. He's a friend of mine and he's not done anything to you.\" Rita scolded. Willow bowed her head a little, hoping that she hadn't blown it with Rita after they'd been getting closer. \"I can't help it, I am trying. It's just been nice to have you spending time with me for a change, I didn't want the cat getting in the way.\" \"You're not helping your cause,\" said Rita, and she nipped at Willow's ear. \"Look, it's done a whole lot for me to have you around since Dodger went and screwed everything up. Don't know what I'd have done without you, honestly. Just cool it down a notch, okay sis?\" Willow nipped back at Rita and smiled. \"Fine, but I can't help the way I am. Do you want to hang out a little longer? You can't be in a hurry to get back to that awful mutt.\" \"No, no hurry. We can go for something to eat,\" Rita said, starting to head off. \"Hey, you could stay with me,\" Willow suggested quietly, \"If you don't want to be around Dodger, maybe it would be better,\" noticing Rita starting to frown she added quickly, \"I'm not gonna keep on at you about it, just think about it, okay?\" Rita didn't say anything and just kept walking. She imagined coming home to yet another awkward silence as Dodger avoided even looking at her. She had a bed that was now filled with dirt from those stupid flowers, and a former mate who'd be hanging around waiting for her to take him back. The rest of the gang would gather around Dodger as usual, in awe of whatever clever feat he'd pulled off. Rita could feel herself drifting away from the family she loved, and it was all Dodger's fault. Still, she knew she couldn't leave Fagin and the others no matter what Dodger had done to hurt her. What kind of a dog could just walk away from their family? She'd done it before and she swore she'd never do it again. Something had to give- and it was Rita herself who had to start to move forward with Dodger, or her feelings of isolation would only get worse. Rita knew that what she'd said was true; she really wouldn't know how she'd have been able to stand it without Willow on her side. \"Sorry, Dodger,\" Evie said, hanging out the window, \"Oliver wandered over to your place a while ago; I'm hoping he turns up back here soon, or Jenny's gonna worry.\" Seeing the disappointed look on the mutt's face, she added quickly. \"I'll tell him to wait around for you here tomorrow if you like?\" Dodger sighed. \"Thanks, kid.\" With no real reason to hang around, he turned to leave. He was not aware that in just a few minutes' time, Oliver would come bounding up to the house with Rita by his side, and so resigned himself to going home. Being back at the barge these days felt strange and uncomfortable. Everyone was tiptoeing around him and Rita, knowing that their lifelong friendship was teetering precariously on the edge of total collapse. No one said anything about Dodger's betrayal of trust, and had they known about it, no one would have said anything about Rita's cruel words either. The boys were hopeful that the fragile situation would resolve itself, but none of the three dared interfere… the worst case scenario of the gang's disintegration was too much of a threat. It was a worry that played heavily on Dodger's mind. Rita was on the outside, and it felt completely wrong. He tried to reach her, in spite of her own part in their fall out, but she remained closed off to his attempts to extend an olive branch. Still, her words haunted him; after all this time, after all they'd been through, could she really believe that he didn't care for her deeply? \"Dodger!\" Jumping with surprise, and hastily covering it up, Dodger turned to see his former mate coming from his side. Not only had he not expected to see her, but this was one of the few times she'd spoken to him in the past couple of days. He dared to greet her with a nod and a smile. \"You missed Oliver?\" Rita asked. She was tense, but knew she had to start making friendly overtures if she was to salvage something from the relationship that had been so important throughout her life. \"Yeah,\" Dodger shrugged. \"I'll catch him tomorrow.\" They walked side by side in silence for a while. The frost that had built up between the two of them seemed to be thawing, and for the first time in what felt like an age, neither felt the urge to avoid the presence of the other. Dodger wanted more than anything to tell Rita that he'd seen his mother that night. There was no one else he'd ever dreamed of sharing that dark part of his life with, and now Rita was no longer open to him. Would she ever be again? Her words had cut him like a knife, severing the hard-won emotional intimacy that had built between them over the course of their turbulent childhoods and adolescence. Dodger knew he could get over her barbed insults, born as he was well aware in the heat of distress, exhaustion and worry, if only she could bring herself to forgive him in return. Unable to form the words he so wanted to, he simply inquired after Rita's own well-being. \"You are all right, babe? I know you've kinda been pushed aside, and it ain't fair.\" \"Fares are for tourists, Dodger, you know that.\" \"Einy needs companionship- I know I've been hoggin' him, but you should take advantage of it. He misses hangin' out with ya.\" Rita bit her lip. \"I miss you,\" she said, unable to hold back her feelings. \"I miss you too,\" Dodger said, finding himself heartened by her statement. He looked her in the eye for the first time in days. There was something like longing in her face. She wished that Einstein had never gone missing, and that the resulting strain hadn't torn her apart from her dearest friend. That wound could only heal with time. Neither Dodger nor Rita, however, had an inkling of the greater impact of that night that was still to come.[Chapter 18] Willow was waiting outside the warehouse, lying on her belly and enjoying the sun on her back. From her vantage point of a near-collapsing shipping crate, she would see her sister's familiar figure as soon as she came into the vicinity. She'd been spending time with Rita every single day, and felt that they'd finally turned a corner in their tumultuous relationship. While Willow had plenty of dogs whom she knew at home, she didn't have any close friends, and time spent with her sister was precious- and she was very grateful that Rita hadn't seen fit to drag that cat along with her since Oliver's first outing to the warehouse. \"Afternoon, Rita!\" called Willow. She got to her feet and playfully milled around her sister as she approached, her tail wagging in circles. The usual loneliness that troubled her was lessened by her closeness to Rita, and she greeted her with a good deal of enthusiasm. It was a long time since she'd felt inclined to try and play with anyone… but she couldn't deny that it was a nice feeling. Willow gave an exultant bark, and jumped forward. Rita found herself frantically wagging her tail at the sight of her little sister so happy. \"Hey, Will,\" she said, smiling, \"You want to go for a walk?\" The time they'd spent together had softened Willow a little, and allowed her to trust her sister more. It was hard to move past the resentment that had built up since they were pups, but both of them felt the change between them. It grew with each day, and now the sisters gave one another a deep comfort that, for the time being at least, could not be matched elsewhere Spending more time with the infinitely more streetwise Rita had meant that Willow was slowly building confidence around humans, opening up so much more of the city to her and allowing her to seek sustenance through avenues other than just hunting down rats and birds. The pair set off together with wagging tails, with Rita confidently leading the way. It was actually getting to be enjoyable for her to share more of her life with Willow, and it certainly lessened the sadness she'd been feeling over Dodger's betrayal. Rita missed being close to Dodger, and still feeling on the outer of the gang, she missed everyone else too. Everything was so much more strained nowadays, and she found herself in Willow's company instead simply because she couldn't face making the move to heal the great rift that had built up. She still loved Dodger, of that much Rita was certain, but the hurt had yet to fade. Why was it, she wondered, that she let emotion cloud what she should logically put down to the trauma of nearly losing a member of the family? Dodger had been distraught, and not in his right mind when he left her that night; so why could she not just swallow her pride and return to his warm embrace? She wanted to be with him, to feel that unity, and to love without fear of heartbreak. Willow didn't understand the ache that kept a hold of Rita, but she cared, and that would be a comfort in the short term. Dodger arrived at the old warehouse after a quick visit to see Oliver, knowing that it was likely that Rita would be hanging around there with Willow. The past week or so had been hard, aside from the sadness he felt due to the distance that had formed between himself and Rita, things had become uneasy between Dodger and the others as well. For the most part they ignored the situation, but every now and then Dodger would pick up on hints of resentment. They still rallied around him, looking to him as their leader, but something was definitely different. Probably, Dodger imagined, they were concerned that Rita might be driven away completely if the situation couldn't resolve itself soon. The fear was constantly on Dodger's mind, along with the haunting memory of seeing his mother that night. He missed having Rita to confide in, and wished they'd never attempted to take their relationship further, then maybe he'd at least still have his closest friend by his side. Now, she just didn't want to know him, and after four years spent together as trusted companions that was a tough pill to swallow. All of Dodger's attempts to reconcile with Rita had been rebuffed, and they were now simply coexisting, barely speaking. He had to hold out hope though, and the few words they did share were civil, more so than had been the case early on. Dodger had to believe that they might slowly get back the friendship that had always meant so much to him, it just might take some time… a lot of time. As he came through the door, Dodger saw Rita lying, forepaws crossed, on a window ledge, her sister sat beside her. The sun coming through the window illuminated her elegant form, and Dodger couldn't help but admire her. She looked happy… and he wasn't sure whether it spoke well of their chances of reconciling, or the contrary. Dodger pointedly avoided eye contact with Willow; he was struggling enough with the present situation without having to deal with insults as well. For a split second, he thought he saw a glimmer of deep affection in Rita's eyes as she noticed him there, but then it was gone. It had occurred to Dodger that Rita's spending so much time with her sister might hinder his chances for a rebuilding their own relationship, but there was really not a lot he could do about that. \"Yo Rita, I got news,\" Dodger called, \"The kid's got himself a new human.\" \"The baby's been born? How's Oliver taking it?\" Rita jumped down from her perch and walked over, with Willow close behind her. Such an enormous development for the Foxworth family was of great interest to her, and immediately she felt a strong desire to check in with Oliver, Evie- and even Georgette. \"It's a boy apparently, and very loud.\" Dodger said, grinning at the look of excitement on Rita's face. \"Kid doesn't seem quite sure what to make of it, I reckon he's missing having all of Jenny's attention. The baby was born a few days ago, sounds like it's been pretty crazy around their place since then.\" Dodger casually scratched his ear with his back paw, still avoiding looking directly at Willow who stood beside Rita, her stance tense. \"Don't tell me you've gone and passed your jealous streak on to the poor kid.\" Rita said, half-joking. Dodger pulled a face, pretending to be offended, \"No jealous streak here, baby. I'm flawless- and you know it.\" He winked, and was pleased to notice that Rita did not appear put out by the flirting. To the contrary, he saw a glimmer of that old knowing smile she used to give him. How he'd missed that look. \"I'm gonna go round a bit later, hang out with the kid some more. Figured he might appreciate it with all that's been goin' on. You want to come?\" His casual tone hid the urgency of his request well, though he did not expect Rita to be fooled; she knew him too well. \"If she wants to see the stupid cat, she can manage without an escort, Dodger.\" Willow snarled, sensing the slightly thawed atmosphere between the pair and not liking it one bit. If that slimy mutt weaselled his way back into Rita's heart, she, Willow, would be thrown aside, unneeded and unwanted. \"Willow, I can think for myself, thanks.\" Rita snapped. \"Just butt out, will you?\" She was tempted by the offer, and she knew that sooner or later she'd have to make the effort to move forward with Dodger, but Willow's presence made it uncomfortable. For the time being, Willow was her closest confidant, and it made Rita reluctant to risk a fall out. At any rate, she couldn't talk to Dodger properly with her snarky sister determined to stick her oar in. She looked back at Dodger, hoping he'd understand. \"I'll just go on my own, Dodge, maybe tomorrow. The kid's probably gonna enjoy just being with you anyhow. You don't really need me around.\" Rita was furious with herself for letting Willow influence her decision. As much as she loved her sister, she couldn't let her get in the way of any hope there might be for a reconciliation. \"If you change your mind, I'll be hangin' round here for a while. Otherwise I'll see ya back home.\" Rita nodded, and retreated back to the window ledge where she and Willow had been resting. She was vaguely aware of her sister talking to her, but was hardly taking any of it in. Staring after Dodger as he caught up with old friends, she realised that she'd been foolish to continue harbouring resentment after so long. She missed him, and giving him the cold shoulder was only hurting herself. Every now and then, Dodger would glance in her direction, and his eyes would light up as they met hers. It was time to forgive and move on; just as he had done all the times she'd broken his trust- she herself was not perfect, after all. Her soft eyes following Dodger as he weaved between acquaintances, no doubt boasting heartily as he went, Rita was disconcerted to realise that she was not the only one gazing at him intently. A large dog, tall and muscular with a wiry tan coat, kept looking Dodger's way, his eyes noticeably remaining fixed on the terrier mutt as he moved around. Beside this stranger was the very same burly white dog who had been unnervingly focused on Oliver when Rita had brought him along to the warehouse. Surely it couldn't be a coincidence, and Rita was alarmed. \"Willow, do you know that dog?\" Rita nudged her sister's shoulder and gestured towards the stranger, who was flanked by the white dog, and a muscular bullmastiff. \"That guy next to him is familiar, he had his eye on Oliver the other day.\" Willow looked over, only vaguely interested. \"Looks familiar, I'm sure I've seen him before, but I can't place him. Anyway, I'm pretty sure everyone here was eyeing up the cat, what with him being… well, a cat.\" Rita frowned. \"I might be overreacting, but something just doesn't feel right. I'm gonna keep an eye on him.\" Willow was not bothered by Rita's concerns and carried on with her one-sided conversation as her sister half-listened. \"You think someone else might know him?\" Rita asked over the top of Willow. She got to her feet and started moving around the room, much to Willow's irritation. \"I don't know. Maybe?\" Willow grumbled, \"If we ask around, will you just forget about it for a while?\" She might just as well have not bothered asking, for Rita was already off and looking for a familiar face to ask. Willow followed after her, up the stairs to where the hangout's more permanent residents tended to frequent. \"Who?\" An old Weimaraner, asked, responding to an anxious Rita. \"Big guy, he had a couple of others with him. Tan sort of coloured fur, dark mask on his muzzle. I don't know what it is, but something about him just makes me nervous.\" The Weimaraner's face hardened. \"Oh, that's Flint,\" she said. \"You'll have heard of him, but in case you need reminding, you should keep your distance. I've seen too many good dogs killed by that lot. If Flint's after Dodger for some reason, you'd better watch out.\" Her voice was tired and tinged with sadness, and she registered the fear that flashed in Rita's eyes at her words. \"Unfortunately, this place is free to everyone. As long as he doesn't kick up any trouble in here, I can't do anything to get him out.\" \"I know, Athena,\" Rita said, trying to keep the fear from coming through in her voice, \"Thanks.\" She turned away, anxious to get back to Dodger, to put him on guard. Had there been a reason why Flint's companion had been so fixated on Oliver that day? A dreadful thought came to her. Had one of Flint's gang seen Dodger and Oliver with their old prisoner, Evie? As she headed back down the stairs, Rita's blood ran cold as she found that Dodger was nowhere to be seen- and neither were Flint and his two companions. She took the rest of the stairs at a run, and frantically looked around, hoping that Dodger was somewhere just out of sight, and safe, but he was gone. She crashed into Willow, who had been following close behind her, as she turned to make a hasty exit. \"Wait, slow down!\" Willow demanded, confused by Rita's response. \"Why would this Flint guy be after Dodger? You've never even seen him before, and I'm guessing neither has your jerk boyfriend! Don't you think you're overreacting a little?\" \"Willow, you remember I said our cat got himself a friend off the streets? The one who's scared of dogs? Before they found her she'd got caught up with Flint's gang, she managed to get away, but if one of them saw her when she was out that night with Dodger there could be real trouble.\" Rita felt ill at the thought. If Flint knew Dodger had a connection to Evie, they'd both be in grave danger. \"Will, he's headin' over there! I've gotta go after them. I'm sorry, I've really gotta go.\" She looked at Willow apologetically and ran off sniffing the air as she went to try and ascertain which way they'd gone. \"He's not worth it Rita, please !\" Willow cried, \"If Dodger's got himself in hot water it's no less than he deserves. You saw those dogs; if you try and pick a fight with them they will tear you apart.\" Rita paused and looked back to her sister, her face filled with despair. \"I don't care what he's done- he's family. I'm not standin' by when he could be in danger.\" Not expecting Willow to get it, she turned and kept running, hoping desperately that her fears would be unfounded. He legs felt shaky beneath her as she ran, and her breath caught in her throat. The cold feeling in the pit of her stomach told her that her fears were not for nothing; something was terribly wrong, and she had to get to Dodger- fast. Staring after Rita, Willow grew scared. Sure, it could well be that Flint's leaving at the same time as Dodger was purely coincidental, but if something was about to go down, she hated to think of her only real friend being caught up in the middle of it- and Rita was far too stupid to listen to reason and just leave Dodger to whatever might be coming to him. Those dogs were large, muscular and obviously no strangers to brawling; Willow had no doubt that if a fight broke out neither Rita nor Dodger would stand much chance.[Chapter 19] Rita darted around nervously, trying to pin-point the scent that she needed to focus on. She'd never been very good at tracking. While she knew that Dodger would be heading over to see Oliver, there were plenty of routes he could be taking. She didn't expect that Dodger, nor his pursuers, had gotten very far in the time since Rita had seen them last, and was hopeful that she could catch up quickly. As she moved away from the docks, Rita was startled by the sound of footsteps behind her, and spun around, snarling, fearing that she too had been followed. \"Calm down, it's just me!\" Willow hissed. \"Thought you might want some back up, just in case things get ugly.\" \"I thought you said I was overreacting?\" Rita was thankful that it was only Willow, and no one threatening who'd followed her, but her sister would not be the first person she'd have chosen to back her up in a fight. Willow was all bark and no bite, and not terribly confident away from the quieter parts of the city. If they were heading up to Oliver's, she could well end up being more of a hindrance than a help. Still, Rita supposed, maybe having an extra dog on their side would at least make them appear more threatening if it came to a fight. \"Better to be safe, don't you think?\" Willow frowned. Rita didn't appear all that appreciative of her support. Rita nodded, \"Thanks Willow. I think… I think they came through here, smells like Dodger.\" As they'd gotten further away from the warehouse, the confusing mixture of the scents of many dogs was less of an issue. Rita kept moving, and gestured for Willow to follow. It had been a little while since Dodger first had the feeling that he was being watched, catching a glimpse of a large tan furred dog behind him as he crossed a road. He'd not seen the dog since, but the scent seemed continually present as he carried on his way, and the scent made him suspect that there was more than one following him. Knowing that most street dogs, lacking in the street savoir-faire that Dodger was proudly well endowed with, tended to avoid traffic, he changed his route slightly, making sure he stayed as close to human activity and busy roads as he could. Still, he was largely unconcerned, chances were there'd be nothing to worry about. Dodger had made up his mind just to wander- it wasn't worth the risk to go and see Oliver, or even to return to the barge if there was someone after him. As he turned down an alley he was cut off by a large white dog. The stranger was tall and well-muscled, a feature accentuated by his smooth coat. Dodger coolly made to step around the stranger, cautious but with no outward impression of it. The white dog moved quickly to block his path. \"What's the hurry? Is your little feline friend waiting for you?\" The sneer came from behind Dodger, and he turned to see the wire-haired dog whom he'd suspected of following him. \"Actually- our little feline friend. The weasel gave us the slip a while back, and I'm hoping you can reunite me with her. Seems the cat needs to learn a lesson in loyalty.\" So this is Flint , Dodger thought to himself. He was suddenly filled with dread, but forced himself to push it away. A third dog, a burly bullmastiff, had appeared behind Flint and was staring at Dodger with a threatening gaze. \"Sorry, can't help you there,\" Dodger knew that lying would do him little good if these dogs had already seen him with Evie; it wasn't exactly normal for street dogs to be hanging around with cats. \"Maybe you oughtta address why people are walkin' out on you in the first place. Sounds like you've got yourself a relations problem there.\" \"Listen, terrier, and listen close. You were seen with the cat, no mistakin' it. And if you're not going to cooperate, maybe the little kitty's not the only one who's going to need teaching a lesson…\" Rita stuck with the scent; it seemed that Dodger, if it was actually his trail she was on still, was no longer going the direction she'd expect him to if he was going towards the Foxworths'. She felt a niggling doubt that she had been following the wrong scent the whole time, but reminded herself that if Dodger had become suspicious he would probably have changed his course. Willow quietly tagged along behind, already starting to regret her decision to join Rita. Suddenly, the sound of barking rang out, apparently not too far away. Rita and Willow lifted their heads simultaneously. Rita could feel her heart pounding as she picked up the sounds of fierce growling, and then a yelp- it was a dogfight. She broke out into a sprint, tearing towards the direction of the noise, certain that it was Dodger and that he was in serious trouble. Within seconds she was on to them; all three strangers were going at Dodger as he was trapped up against a wall. The sight filled Rita with an intense fury, and she pounced onto Flint, who was biting ferociously at the base of Dodger's neck. Surprised, the attackers withdrew slightly, allowing Dodger to get himself into a better position to retaliate. One of the dogs, a bullmastiff, turned his attention to Rita, biting at her hind leg as he pulled her to the ground. She fought back, biting the back of his neck, and was filled with courage as Willow joined her side. Flint backed off again, and his supporters followed suit, unnerved by the sudden appearance of the two hounds- they could not be sure that they would not be joined by others. Dodger slipped away, confident that Rita and Willow would follow close behind him. Leaping out onto a slowly passing car, Dodger immediately felt safer, confident that out in the traffic there was no way the aggressors could match him. He glanced back over his shoulder to make sure Rita was behind him, and picked up his speed, knowing that they desperately needed to put some space between themselves and his attackers. He was already battered and bruised, and knew he'd be at a great disadvantage if it came to blows again. By now Flint had recovered from the surprise and was in hot pursuit, with the bullmastiff and the stocky white dog joining in the chase. \"You all right, Willow?\" Rita called behind her, knowing that running over the tops of cars was way out of her sister's comfort zone. Willow didn't reply. She was too preoccupied with keeping up, and she panted nervously. Running over the tops of cars was a new experience for her, but there was nothing else for it but to follow Rita's lead and hope for the best. It was strangely thrilling- Willow had managed to get in a few bites at those awful dogs before running off, and she was rather impressed with her own bravery. As the chase went on, however, she found herself struggling to keep going, and all the while she was terrified of being left to the mercy of those dogs. By this time, Rita was right beside Dodger. It was an enormous relief to not have found him torn apart by Flint, and despite the fear she felt, having him near was reassuring as it always had been. They paused to allow Willow to catch up; and it was all that Flint and his companions needed to ramp up their pursuit. Rita felt a sinking feeling that Willow wouldn't be able to stay ahead of them for much longer. She exchanged a glance with Dodger and knew that he understood. Willow crouched submissively, finally giving up on an escape and prepared to take the beating that was coming her way. She knew they would be on her in a matter of seconds. The roar of the human noise all around her was for once a welcome distraction. Rita clashed with the bullmastiff, who was first to reach them. The force of their collision sent them both sliding over the edge of the car roof and onto the bonnet. They hardly noticed the scream of the driver as the car screeched to a stop. For a moment, the bullmastiff found himself outnumbered as Dodger leapt into the fray, snarling fiercely, but then Flint and the large white dog arrived and it turned to chaos. The fight moved away from the traffic and into a builder's yard; Flint was much more comfortable away from the threat of human activity and confidently regained control of the situation, separating Dodger from the others and driving him up on the roof of a tired building. Dodger was already wounded from the first attack and despite the defiance of his stance and snarls, he was nervous. He was furious with himself for getting driven to this place away from his allies- not only was he vulnerable, but he could not properly tell what was happening to them. Rita was family, and in Dodger's eyes, his responsibility to protect. He braced himself as Flint smashed into him, smacking him hard against a pile of bricks and crashing down on his chest again and again with ferocious blows of his paws. Dodger yelped in pain as Flint pounded into him, and fought back, biting the brute's leg and holding on stubbornly. He was not about to give in. Flashing lights and shouting voices heralded the appearance of a group of intoxicated youths in their cars, and tyres screeched as they pulled up by the building site. Momentarily distracted from the fight, the eyes of Rita, Willow, the bullmastiff, and the powerful white dog flickered over to the young men, whose voices heightened in drunken excitement as they saw their canine observers. The white dog took the opportunity to change tactic, and he followed after Flint, prepared to help him take down their real target, Dodger. The sound of human yelling, a sound that was coming closer and dripping with aggression, was the final straw for the flighty Willow. Panicked, she broke free from the main fight and ran for her life, all logic and thought lost in her desperate scramble to get away. Rita had been torn between standing by her sister, and keeping the white dog away from Dodger, but something made her turn around, and she realised that the brawny bullmastiff was in pursuit of Willow, who was now all alone and vulnerable. She glanced up to where she'd last seen Dodger and forced herself to make the decision quickly; Dodger might be able to outsmart Flint and his mob, might even be able to put up something of a fight- Willow had no such hopes. Feeling fear from deep in the pit of her stomach, Rita took chase, following the bullmastiff's path to where her sister had fled. It became clear very quickly that the bullmastiff's new tactic was to drive away Dodger's allies, and targeting Willow- clearly the weaker of the two, was the way to do it. His pursuit was relentless; by no means could he match the hound for speed, but he followed steady, a look of supreme focus on his deeply wrinkled face. Rita caught up with no trouble at all, but his sheer bulk meant that her efforts to drive him away were futile. The bullmastiff would harass the panicked hound for as long as it took for him to be sure that Flint would have had the time to deal with the terrier mutt. Gasping for air, Willow could no longer keep running, and once more she dropped into a ball on the ground, accepting of her fate. Rita surged forward, growling a deep, rumbling growl, ready to defend her sister with her life. She stood over Willow, her whole body tense and shaking with the strain of the prolonged fight and chase. The bullmastiff charged the two bitches, barrelling past them with a rough shove. And then he kept on going, leaving them panting behind them. Flint was not here; there was no reason to subject himself to further wounds for the sake of putting down these two women. They were out of the way, and by his reckoning, that was enough. Stunned by the bullmastiff's turn, Rita continued her loud threat, but watched him go. The urge to chase, to lay into the brute, was strong, but it would achieve nothing. Bizarrely, he'd spared Willow's life. The poor, terrified hound was still panting on the ground, shaking from muzzle to tail. She was fine, but they were now probably miles from where they'd left Dodger. A cold feeling of dread swept through Rita's body, taking away any awareness she might otherwise have had of her own wounds. She kicked out, swearing, as tears prickled her eyes and her heart caught in her throat. She'd kept Willow safe, but at what cost? Already badly injured, he'd be completely at their mercy. She had to get him back to him… she had to get back. \"Rita?\" Willow whimpered. She'd never been in a serious fight in all her life, and while every instinct in her told her to run for shelter before it got even worse, she still couldn't bring herself to leave her sister to face the danger alone. That bullmastiff could come back at any moment, and even if he didn't, Willow couldn't imagine her sister rolling over and just letting her mate go. \"Should we go for help? Your gang, they'd want to help Dodger.\" Rita's mind was racing. While her natural response would have been to run home, to get the others by her side, she couldn't shake the feeling that it would be much too dangerous. There was every chance that the bullmastiff still had their eyes on every move she and Willow made; if they'd followed Dodger to try and find their way to Evie, they could well do the same again now. If Flint's powerful pack were to raid the barge, there was no way Fagin's motley crew could put up a fight for long. Besides, Rita thought, none of the boys would be much help if things really got nasty anyway- Einstein was old and easily confused, Francis had all the fighting instincts of limp blanket, and Tito would be bitten in half in a second. Any assistance they might give was drastically overshadowed by the risk to their own lives. She couldn't be responsible for that. Neither could Rita take the risk of going to the Foxworths' to get help from Evie, who might be able to describe where Dodger was being taken. Rita turned to Willow, despair showing in her face. \"Will, we can't,\" she said, her mouth dry. \"If those dogs followed us, Fagin wouldn't stand a chance. We've gotta do this alone.\" \"We'll be killed!\" Willow gasped, horrified at the task ahead of them. Taking on Flint with just two allies was one thing, but on his own turf they'd be drastically outnumbered. She knew enough to know the brutish dog had gathered quite a following, and the dogs he sought were no shrinking violets. \"You don't have to come with me, you know. But I can't just leave him.\" Rita's voice trembled as she spoke. She feared that Willow was right; what on earth would Fagin and the gang think when she and Dodger never came home? Would anyone ever know what had happened to them? \"I'm fast,\" she said, covering up her own fears, \"There's no reason why I wouldn't be able to escape if I can't save Dodger.\" \"And then what? They could still follow you home!\" Willow demanded. \"I say you take the cat to them- it's her they're after. They might just leave you be once they get what they want.\" \" No ! Do you take me as someone who could carry a friend to her death? Really ? Evie's vulnerable, and Fagin's vulnerable. I'm not risking their lives to save my own skin. I can sense it, Will, we're being watched. If I cause enough of a stir, we can escape in the chaos or die trying.\" Willow looked deep into her sister's eyes. She had to be certain before following her on this near suicidal rescue mission. \"But what about Dodger,\" she said calmly. \"Whatever I might think about him, on some level he likes you a lot. Would he really want you to die for him? What about those other idiots you hang around with? What about the old Dane- doesn't he need you to help keep him safe?\" Rita swallowed anxiously, unwilling to truly comprehend a worst-case scenario. She tried to imagine how the gang would carry on without their two strongest members. They'd get by; hard as it would be, they'd get by. And Dodger… Dodger would do the same for her without a second thought. Rita returned Willow's gaze. \"Dodge would do it for me,\" she said firmly, \"and if there's even the smallest chance I might be able to bring him back home, I can't just walk away.\" \"And I can't walk away from you,\" said Willow. \"If you're really going to do this, I'll be on your side.\" Her whole body trembled as the magnitude of this mission truly dawned on her. Going into Flint's lair to fight for Dodger's release sounded like pure madness. There was no question of her standing by her sister though; aside from Rita, Willow felt alone in the world. Perhaps, she thought, it was this same depth of love that led Rita to put herself in danger for Dodger, in spite of all his faults. Rita gave her sister a solemn nod of understanding and sincere appreciation. Come what may, they'd be in this together, and she could only pray that the rescue mission would not end in tragedy.[Chapter 20] Dodger walked behind Flint, all the while feeling the hot breath of the muscular white dog at his flank. With his captors keeping close, it was clear that making a break for it would be near impossible, but still he kept his senses sharp, waiting for any opportunity. Whatever these thugs had in mind for him, he wouldn't give in and betray Oliver and his vulnerable friend. He trusted that Rita and Willow would have been able to get the better of the bullmastiff- he had to, with his own rather dire predicament to deal with. Every now and then, the white dog would give him a hard nip on the rump, making it known that any funny business would not be tolerated. Dodger growled, his head down. \"Pipe down,\" Flint said, sneering. \"You may have put up a fight before, but you're all alone now. If you want to live to see the sun come up, you'll have to start being more cooperative.\" He gave Dodger's ear a sharp bite. \"And if we catch scent or sight either of those bitches, you'll get a front-row seat while we put them down. Better hope they learned their lesson.\" They twisted and turned through the streets, while the skies darkened. Dodger knew that they were heading toward the docks, but further north from where he and his gang frequented… and where many of the dogs he knew had disappeared after run-ins with Flint had. The big, wiry Flint stopped them as they came in front of an eerie derelict building, and howled his presence. Within seconds, a sturdy blue-grey Pit Bull mix emerged through the gaping hole beside the front door. Her lips were tight and serious as she looked over what her leader had brought in. She bowed her head before talking to Flint. \"I take it this is the one who was hanging around with our cat.\" \"Correct,\" said Flint, \"He'll be under your guard. Bring him to me if he has a change of heart about helping us reunite with our little furry friend, but otherwise just let him die slowly.\" He turned to look Dodger in the eye, his eyes flashing in threat. \"It's amazing what starvation can do to loosen the tongue. I'll see how long you last.\" Dodger looked at the tyrant with a seething hatred. He wouldn't be backing down, and he stared back defiantly, making sure that Flint knew it. \"You,\" Flint snarled, now facing the bullmastiff, who'd slunk forward from the shadows. \"can assist Flash.\" The bullmastiff looked dejected, and Dodger wondered why. Still, though, the big, burly dog lowered his head respectfully and said, \"Yes, sir.\" Flash led Dodger into the dark and foreboding building, while the bullmastiff tailed, continuing to push his captive forward. There was a strong smell of dog in the air, and Dodger could see canine figures moving in the darkened corners of the building. It was just one large and cavernous room, with old furniture, planks of wood and old trashcans littered throughout. Dodger suspected that Flint's gang had been taking shelter here for some time. Evie had said that they'd been in a junkyard, but clearly they'd found more comfortable digs in the meantime and fitted it out to suit their needs. Coming to a wooden crate, Flash stopped. Before Dodger could react, the bullmastiff jumped onto him, pinning him against the cold concrete floor. The mutt barked and growled up a storm, but he was powerless to get out of the much larger dog's grasp. Flash, unconcerned by Dodger's futile struggles, pressed her weight against his left hind leg, holding it steady. Then, she bit deep into his paw and pulled, tearing his pad deeply, so that it was half hanging, and bleeding profusely. Dodger yelped, unable to contain himself in spite of his desire to put up a defiant front. He fought further, and was thrown into the crate. \"That should keep you from making any fast getaways,\" snarled Flint as he walked past. He met the eye of Flash, whose face was darkened with blood. \"Have fun with your new pet, Flash.\" \"I intend to, sir.\" Again, Flash bowed her head as she addressed her leader. She watched him saunter back to the front room, where most of the dogs were gathered, and turned back to Dodger. \"Don't waste your energy growlin'. You're not gettin' a thing to eat, so better make yourself comfortable for a long few days if you're not gonna talk.\" Her cropped ear flicked back to the doorway that Flint had slipped through. \"The bite to the foot is a precaution. Can't have you runnin' away 'til the boss gets what he wants. I'm just doin' my job.\" Something in the pit bull's tone was almost sympathetic; perhaps she'd been on the rough end of Flint herself. Dodger grunted and turned away. Flash did have a point- this was going to be a long haul, and he'd have to save his energy if he was going to get himself out of this corner alive. He lay down, staring straight ahead, paying his two guards no notice. His eyes closed, he could almost block everything out and concentrate on thinking up a plan of escape. A worry lingered, that Rita- and Willow for that matter, might still be in danger. Dodger had to hope that Rita's sense of self-preservation would have kept her from trying to follow where Flint had taken him… but still he couldn't imagine her just giving up while he was in danger. He'd know though- if Flint and his gang got hold of his friends, they wouldn't keep it quiet. Dodger sighed. For the time being, he'd just have to take in his scenario and learn about his captors; somewhere, Flint had to have a weakness, and he was going to find it. From the building site where she'd last seen Dodger, Rita had followed her nose, while Willow stumbled along behind, exhausted. Initially, she'd been fearful that Flint would have killed Dodger on the spot, but the scent trail confirmed what she'd thought was more likely- that the terrier had been taken prisoner. Rita imagined that a blood-thirsty dog like Flint would be unwilling to give up his best chance of tracking down a deserter like Evie. It meant they had time, a chance, and she knew that Dodger's life could depend on her own ability to outsmart one of the most dangerous dogs around. \"The scent's getting stronger,\" Willow remarked, shuddering. Every instinct in her screamed for her to turn back, but still she kept trudging onwards. Rita's senses sharpened as she realised they had to be coming close. If they were spotted and hunted down, the fight to get Dodger to safety could be over before it began. \"Keep your voice down,\" she hissed. \"If we're close, they could find us before we find them.\" She lifted her head, feeling the evening wind against her fur. \"Once we've found the hideout, we gotta keep downwind.\" As they carried onwards, neither dog spoke a word, all too aware that they were wandering into perilous territory. The scent of dog was now heavy, and Rita knew they were upon Flint's lair. Suddenly, her heart beat faster, and her instincts told her to find cover. She pulled at Willow's ear, tugging her down behind a pile of old truck tyres. They each held their breath, as a large, lumbering grey dog- a wolfhound of some sort perhaps, and a sturdy black Labrador-like dog trotted past. Rita froze, not daring to move a muscle. If these dogs were in league with Flint, then she and Willow were already outsized and vulnerable. The wolfhound lifted a shaggy head, appearing to scan the surrounds for intruders, and then slunk forward to a darkened and foreboding building, clambering over the rubble that lined a hole that had been opened up beside the unhinged door. This, Rita was now certain, was it. After the lab mix had followed the wolfhound out of sight, Rita cautiously sat back up. \"Come on,\" she whispered to a shaking Willow, \"we gotta find better cover- somewhere we can see them, but they can't see us.\" Rita retreated to a shipping container, and checked that it was downwind from the hideout. With several wooden crates stacked on top of it, the container looked like the perfect place to wait and watch. The addition of a heavy tarpaulin that the two of them had dragged up and over the crates, they could remain completely hidden. Seeing that Willow was still shaking with nerves as they huddled up in their makeshift lair, Rita gave her a gentle nudge to the shoulder. \"What do we do now?\" Willow asked quietly. In all honesty, Rita did not know what to do, and was scared silly. \"I- I dunno, Will. We've gotta try and get an idea of how many are in there, and when the best time would be to run in. Just goin' in without knowin' anythin' would be suicide. If nothin' else, we gotta make sure Flint's outta the way before we try anythin'. So, I guess now we just wait and watch.\" Willow groaned. When she'd run after her sister all those hours ago, she'd no idea what she was getting herself into. \"Should we take turns sleeping tonight, to be safe?\" \"I think so. We should be fine for now though; it's getting cold out, and they'll probably be bedding down soon.\" Rita pressed herself closer to Willow's side, more for reassurance of having an ally close than anything else, but knowing they'd need to keep one another warm through what she was sure would be a very long night. Neither Rita nor Willow slept well that night. They were relieved when the sun finally came up, warming their bones after hours of shivering, but knew that with the daytime came an exponentially increased danger from the vicious gang of dogs that they were hiding out so close to. Tired or not, they'd have to remain alert. The battle-scarred Flint was the first to appear at the doorway, and his quiet observers ducked behind the tarpaulin, peering out through tiny holes. Rita and Willow lay flat on their bellies while Flint's posse filed past. They tried to keep their very breathing as quiet as possible, knowing that they remained vulnerable and grossly outnumbered. When the coast was clear, they finally lifted their heads. \"How many did you see?\" Willow asked. \"Six or seven,\" Rita said. \"The bullmastiff wasn't there, though, I'm sure of it. Must be in there with Dodger.\" \"Flint left though, and the white dog. So, there's only one left in there that would recognise us.\" Rita bit her lip. Now could be a perfect time to make a bid to free Dodger, but still she wasn't sure. She didn't know how many dogs were still inside, and she knew at least one of them was big and powerful enough to put up a fight against herself and Willow at the same time. Dodger, she knew, would have had the perfect idea of what to do, but he wasn't here. \"I think we should wait 'till tomorrow. If there are other dogs in there, they'll come out sometime today, and then at least we'll know what we're dealing with.\" Willow was quietly relieved; she would live at least one more day, and that had to be something to be grateful for. Having seen her boss off, Flash lay down, facing away from Dodger, but with an ear frequently twitching in his direction. \"Still keepin' your trap shut about that cat?\" \"I'd love to help ya, babe, but somethin' tells me ya boss ain't about to welcome her back with a waggin' tail. I'll have to decline.\" Bruiser spoke. \"I hope your friends had the sense to scarper,\" he said. \"Flint will want to find them.\" Something in the bullmastiff's tone told Dodger that he was genuinely concerned, and it took him by surprise. \"They're smart; one of them anyway,\" he said. \"Nice to look at too, real leggy and exotic,\" Bruiser said. \"You've done all right for yourself. Take it at least one of 'em's your mate?\" Dodger remained baffled by Bruiser's light, conversational tone. Was he trying to get information out of him? \"Definitely easy on the eyes,\" he said, not letting his guard down. \"You can relax a little,\" Flash said gruffly. \"Neither of us are about to sell you out. If you have strong allies, we might just be able to swing an escape for all of us.\" \"Ya expect me to believe that?\" Bruiser gave a low growl. \"You're not goin' anywhere. Hearin' us out won't do ya any harm. My brother was driven out, left for dead. I'm no fool; I know I'm on thin ice.\" \"I've wanted out pretty much since I got in; it's easier said than done,\" said Flash. \"We maybe got one or two on our side, and Bruiser's brother Charlie, but not enough that we wouldn't get hunted down for trying. If you wanna get outta here alive, you're gonna need to cooperate with us.\" Dodger was unmoved. It wasn't his own safety that was at stake, but Rita's and Willow's. Bruiser knew what they looked like, and he wasn't getting any more information than that. All the same, what he'd just been told might be of some use… if he could use Bruiser, Flash, and any other dissenters to get away from here without putting Rita in danger, he'd do it. \"I'm not bringin' anyone else into this. If you really wanna help, you won't need information in return.\" Flash nodded her head, but frowned. \"If we're gonna throw a mass desertion, we're gonna need all the help we can get. The minute you turn your back on Flint is the minute you sign your own death warrant. At least five of 'em will fight for the death for the boss, and with you and Charlie we're only four- six at best, but some of them we can't count on. If your friends can fight with you, we might be able to swing it in our favour. This ain't just life or death for you- if Bruiser gets caught with his brother, he's gone. You saw the mother with the half-grown pups? She's a mess, she needs outta here before he makes her raise more kids for him. We're desperate, buddy, and the way I see it, you are too.\" Bruiser whined, his own fears finally showing through the hardened exterior. \"I'm begging you- this is our best hope of getting out from under this psycho,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I chased those girls down; if I wanted 'em dead, I'd have done it. Why would I let 'em go? You tell me what to say and where to find 'em, and I'll talk to 'em.\" Finally, Dodger had to concede that the best he could do was trust Bruiser… to a point. Rita and Willow could outrun a big, lumbering dog like that if they had to anyway- they'd already done so once before. \"Willow- the blonde one, hangs out at Murphy and Athena's warehouse,\" he said, figuring that Athena would be capable of keeping her 'lodgers' safe from aggressive intruders. \"She's a regular, and they all know her there, so you'll find her there no problem.\" Flash's neck snapped around, and she looked at Dodger with a penetrating stare. \"This Willow, she's a leggy, blonde bitch, you say? Built like a greyhound, but with long fur?\" Dodger frowned, not sure what to make of the pit bull's response… it was almost as if Flash knew who he was talking about, but Willow didn't have friends. Unless they'd met at the old warehouse; the place was always crawling with dogs from all walks of life, so it was at least a possibility. \"Blonde, and darker brown fur. Kinda flighty and snipey. No sense of fun. You know her?\" He was taken aback by the expression on Flash's face, almost as if she were about to cry. \"My yard-mate. My Willow. I've known that skinny fluff-ball since she were a pup. It's gotta be her.\" Flash suddenly jumped to her feet, her tail wagging fast. \"I lost her when I we got bailed up by Flint's lot- she ran, and I fought. I fought so good, Flint said he'd let me live if I joined him. If this is my Willow, I gotta find her. She'll trust me; I know she will.\" Her face was set with determination, as if suddenly her fight for freedom had meaning- she had someone she had to go to, someone she knew would have missed her. Bruiser, like his companion, was grinning and wagging his tail. \"This is perfect! That's a guaranteed number on our side, right there.\" Dodger couldn't help but scoff. \"You know that woman's got all the fighting instincts of a marshmallow, right?\" Instantly, he felt that he was being most unfair to willow; she had courageously defended him by Rita's side. \"Look, if what you're sayin' is true, you might be able to get the girls on side. But they're gonna see a dog comin' their way and scarper. You'd be lucky to get close enough for old Wills to get a good look at who you are.\" \"And the other one?\" Bruiser asked, cocking his head. \"If you don't mind me sayin', the dark one packed a mean bite. My hunch is you'd want to be cautious approaching blondie with her around.\" \"The 'other one' don't live with Willow, but I'd bet anythin' they're stickin' together.\" Dodger was reluctant to give anymore away about Rita; doing so could get the rest of the gang involved as well. \"They're sisters, so you'd be right not to underestimate what they'd do for one another if pushed.\" Flash listened thoughtfully. \"Willow spoke of her sister. Rita?\" The look on the terrier's face told her that the dog they were after was one and the same. \"Willow is family to me, like both of them obviously are to you. I need to find her, not just for our benefit, but to make sure she's clued out on how to stay safe from Flint.\" The pit bull's voice cracked with emotion; she'd had no one else for so long… just her timid waif, Willow. There was now so much more at stake for her, and it was terrifying. \"I'll go to Athena's place, and I'll find my Willow. I won't give up until I do.\" Dodger's instincts told him that Flash was genuine. Having a true friend of Willow's- albeit one that had savaged his paw- on side gave him a glimmer of hope. He watched as Flash paced to the opening by the door. \"Good luck; tell 'em I'm not givin' in, and that I'm gettin' out.\"[Chapter 21] Growing hungry, Dodger's rescue party of Rita and Willow had returned to the surrounding streets and alleys to scavenge. They remained on edge, cautious, but knew that they couldn't go without eating indefinitely. Rita had been in a half mind for them to split up; one keep watch over Flint's lair while the other foraged, but she couldn't bring herself to leave Willow's side while they remained in dangerous territory. The younger sister was simply lacking in street smarts, and out here it would take very little for that to be a fatal flaw. The search for food was hasty; Rita just wanted to take the edge off her hunger before returning to monitor the movements of Flint's gang, but still she hated the feeling of returning to that place. The sense of danger was stifling, and as she and Willow make their way back towards their lookout, it took a great deal of courage to put one paw in front of the other. Suddenly, Rita froze, an unnerving feeling of being observed halting her in her tracks. She nipped Willow's shoulder, telling her to stop where she was. \"What is it?\" Willow hissed, crouching nervously. Rita hesitated, sniffing the air. There was a dog near. She went around the back of Willow, so the two of them could see in all directions. \"Someone's watching us.\" Out of the shadows, a figure emerged. Her head was held high, unafraid. And then she spoke. \"Willow?\" Rita was dumbstruck. Who was this? More importantly, how did she know Willow? None of the dogs from the warehouse would have followed them out this way. Willow's mouth hung open. That face brought back a stream of memories, both painful and comforting. \"Flash? Is that… you?\" The newcomer squirmed and wagged her tail, painting a picture of a non-threatening figure. Willow ran forward, ignoring Rita's attempt to hold her back, and she bounded around Flash. A deep growl interrupted the reunion. Close to enemy territory, Rita was not about to let her guard down. \"It's okay, Rita,\" Willow said, a grin on her face. \"This is Flash; she was in the yard with me, she escaped with me… she's my friend.\" Rita took on board her sister's words, but nonetheless gave the stranger a penetrating glare. \"Are you alone? Were you sent to search for us?\" \" Rita! She's my friend ! We can trust Flash, all right?\" Flash nuzzled Willow's shoulder. \"It's fine, Will, she's right to be careful.\" She returned Rita's gaze, hoping to convince her to at least listen. \"I'm alone, and I chose to search for you because I wanted to find you.\" She paused, knowing that what she had to say next was unlikely to be met well. \"I'm part of Flint's gang; I know where your friend is.\" In an instant, Rita's face had curled into a vicious snarl. \" Flint! And you want me to trust you…\" \"I'm not with him! I've come to you for help. For me and for Dodger.\" Willow whined. \"Rita, please listen! She wouldn't hurt me, she wouldn't…\" \"Just hear me out; please.\" Rita growled, her hackles still raised. \"Talk, I'm listening.\" \"Thank you,\" said Flash. \"We should move further away from Flint's lair, though, I can't be overheard.\" The three dogs slunk through darkened alleys until Flash was satisfied with the distance that had been built between them and her home. \"Okay,\" she began, her voice still hushed out of habit, \"I'll start at the beginning. Willow and I were roaming around together, not really knowing where we were. We were cornered in an alley when he came upon us. Flint. He had a bunch of others with him, and they threatened us.\" She looked to Willow. \"Will ran, and I fought. Flint saw something in me, a fire in my belly and the tenacity to fight. He thought I'd be useful, so he let me live. I didn't know what I was getting caught up in, but I'd take it over getting ripped to shreds.\" \"And you've been with him all this time?\" Willow asked. Flash nodded. \"It hasn't been fun, I can tell you that much. I wanted out soon after I arrived, but it was clear that wouldn't be possible. I saw two dogs beat to death for trying. I knew I wasn't the only one disloyal to Flint, but it took a long time to communicate with others- there was always the risk of word getting back to the boss. Things only really changed a couple of months ago; one of the young dogs, a bullmastiff called Charlie, tried to challenge Flint for mating rights- he'd seen the way the boss had treated his brood bitch, and wouldn't stand for it. He was driven out, and his brother Bruiser was only allowed to stay after being beaten to within an inch of his life. When he was still broken and battered, Bruiser came to me. We started looking for a way out, but we knew it couldn't happen with just the two of us- even if we could get Charlie to fight alongside us.\" \"So, you want to use Dodger… and us?\" Rita asked, frowning. \"You won't be able to get him out of there without my help,\" said Flash. \"Only Bruiser and I are guarding him most of the time, but if he gets away on our watch, we will be punished- Bruiser could well be killed. I won't let that happen.\" Rita growled, realising that she was getting dragged into something bigger than what she'd expected. Still, she listened, wanting to hear exactly what Flash was proposing. \"So, what do you want to do?\" \"Bruiser and I will need to mount a challenge to Flint; without a clear dethroning observed by the others, we'll only be setting ourselves up to be killed. With Dodger, the two of you, and Charlie, we will be strong enough to make a powerful statement- and we may well have others onside.\" \"But Flash,\" Willow said, \"how many of them are there? Flash bit her lip. \"Aside from me and Bruiser, nine.\" \" Nine? \" Willow gasped. Rita hung her head. This sounded like suicide. \"I know,\" said Flash, \"but they'll be unprepared, and not all of them will want to fight us. I know how crazy it sounds, but you're the only hope Bruiser and I have. We're trapped.\" Looking into Flash's eyes, Willow nodded. \"We'll do it.\" \"You're kidding!\" Rita demanded. \"Challenging Flint directly will get us all killed! And we're supposed to go along with it just because she said so? If we stick to the original plan, we might be able to get Dodger out of there. We didn't come here to dismantle Flint's gang.\" Willow was shocked by Rita's continued hostility. \"I can't help you if that means putting Flash in harm's way, not any more than I could expect you to put Dodger's life in danger,\" she growled. \"You might not trust her, but I do. Flash was with me through my darkest days, since I was a scrawny, scared little kid.\" She stared hard into her sister's eyes, willing her to understand. \"She is my Dodger.\" Rita's hackles remained raised, and she breathed heavily. She had little choice; whether she liked it or not, Willow's circle of trust extended into a part of Flint's gang, and she'd just have to retain faith that Flash was not just trying to keep the rescue attempt at bay. She looked to Flash, who was as tense as she. \"If you're a friend of Willow's, you're a friend of mine,\" she said finally. \"Give her your word that no harm will come to Dodger as a result of our holding back- holding back at your request- and I'll work with you.\" Nodding her head, Flash looked back to Willow. \"You have my word, Will. Bruiser and I will fight if need be. We can only free ourselves with your help, and with Dodger's.\" \"Thank you, Flash,\" Willow said, and she came forward to nuzzle her face against her old friend's neck. She feared for Flash, and wished desperately that she could stay rather than return to her dangerous post at Flint's side. \"We'll look for your signal.\" Peering up from her old friend's embrace, Flash met eyes with Rita. \"I'm the best hope your Dodger has right now. Bruiser told me you're a smart and fierce fighter; it would be an honour to join you against Flint. Please, try to trust me.\" \"I will,\" said Rita firmly. Flash seemed genuine, and what she said was true, aligning with her was Dodger's best hope. \"Tell Dodger I'm coming for him.\" Willow whimpered as Flash pulled away. Could it be that they'd lose one another so soon after being reunited? Flash was powerful and wise, but if Flint cottoned on that she was working against him, she'd surely be killed. Flash turned to the sisters once more before leaving. \"Tomorrow at sun-down,\" she said. \"I'll be at the entrance, and will give three yawns in turn. We'll be ready, then; Bruiser will bring have his brother in waiting too. Flint and the others will be tired at the end of the day. It's our best chance. Good luck, and stay hidden.\" In his prison, Dodger could do little but quietly try to conserve his energy. Bruiser was standing guard, and had been joined by another of Flint's gang, the lanky fawn Great Dane mix, Harper. From Dodger's own observations, he knew that Harper was the mother of the two half-grown pups in the gang, and that she was incredibly fearful of her leader. She wanted out, but Dodger knew that all he could do was keep to himself and let Bruiser try and talk her into supporting their challenge to Flint. If Harper, and by extension the young ones too, took their side, it could be the difference between success and defeat. But, Dodger thought as he looked at the timid bitch, he wasn't sure he could hope for much from someone whose spirit had clearly been broken. Harper was licking her licks, her eyes darting around the room. Should Flint or his allies walk in on the hushed conversation she was having with Bruiser, their punishment would be severe. She understood, though, that she might never again have an opportunity like this to free herself from the bully that had made her life a living hell. \"With you, Flash, Charlie, and the prisoner and his two friends, that will be seven including me,\" she whispered. \"Comet and Star?\" Bruiser urged. He didn't expect Harper would want her son and daughter involved, but when it came to the fight, they'd be forced to choose; their mother or Flint. \"Every number could make the difference. If your pups join us, we might be able to tip this in our favour; decisively defeat Flint without too much bloodshed.\" \"I don't want them to get hurt, Bruiser, but if it comes to a big fight, I don't know that Comet will take our side. You know how loyal he is to his father.\" Harper flinched at the thought. Her son was Flint's too, and was ever eager for his approval. Even if it meant turning his back on his mother, it seemed likely to her that Comet would fight in Flint's defence. \"If I can get Star out of here though…,\" her voice trembled. \"She deserves better, she deserves a chance. If she can't get away, her future will be my present. I'll talk to her; even if she won't fight with us, she would never sell us out.\" \"I want you to know that I will never lay a paw on either of them, except in self-defence, no matter what happens. Comet didn't choose who his father is.\" A creaking of the wooden door frame ended the conversation abruptly; someone was back home. Harper hastily scuttled away from Bruiser and lay down on the other side of the room. She exchanged a meaningful look with him, confirming her support. From the entrance hallway came a band of three dogs; a young black bitch, who appeared to be at least half Labrador, Harper's half-grown daughter, Star, and a burly bull terrier mix who was limping badly. \"Mom,\" Star called as she ran over to greet her mother, \"Jag got hurt in our raid of the bridge territory- if it wasn't for Comet, he'd have been dogfood. You shoulda seen him out there.\" Harper licked her daughter's shoulder. \"He's still out there with Flint?\" she asked, sick with worry. If Jag, an experienced fighter, had gotten into trouble, the green Comet would be flirting with danger. The Labrador barked. \"He's fine, Harper, calm your tail,\" she said. \"He's taking after his father- thankfully. Flint's gonna have him join the night patrol with him and Stone.\" She smirked at Bruiser, who gave a low growl. Joining Flint on the evening march was a great privilege; one that the bullmastiff had been stripped of. Bruiser shook off the taunt. Though he couldn't show it, he was very pleased. Jag had a serious injury to his leg- maybe a torn tendon, and just when an opportunity for a challenge was arising. If one of Flint's strongest allies was hobbled, they might just be able to pull off the mutiny. The Labrador approached Bruiser, swishing her tail. Her scent told him that she was coming into heat. \"It's a shame, Bruiser, that you went and disgraced yourself over your fool brother,\" she said snidely. \"You were almost looking like a fine mating prospect for a while there. Now even the kid, Comet, has better chances than you. Actually, I think that terrier you're guarding has too.\" \"Don't worry, Panther, you're not my type,\" Bruiser replied gruffly. He wasn't about to be goaded into a reaction. In Flint's gang, there were four bitches of age to mate; Flash, Harper, Panther, and the tall and wild-looking Wolfie. Of the four, it was only really Wolfie that Bruiser had ever really been interested in, but no male in the gang could so much as talk to a bitch in season without Flint's permission. In the coming days, the leader would begin to aggressively guard Panther, allowing her contact only with males who had earned the privilege. Dodger listened to all the interactions with great curiosity. Like Bruiser, he'd been buoyed by the obvious handicap to one of Flint's strong loyalists, but felt a nagging worry about Harper and her two pups. It sounded likely that Flame would stand by her mother, but Comet was in a position to bring the whole endeavour crashing down. Conflicted loyalties couldn't much be relied upon when it came to a fight to the death. It was too early to hope; for all he knew, Rita and Willow might have disappeared to safety, away from Flash's reach. Without them, he was left with his two guards, Bruiser's brother- a dog he'd never even met, and Harper. It just might be enough, especially if Harper had Star's support, but it still sounded a huge gamble. A couple of hours passed before Flash returned to the hideout. She'd been careful, swimming in the river to wash away Willow's scent. One of Flint's gang, Nico, was a keen-nosed beagle, and had always been utilised to track enemy scents. If he noticed the odour of a stranger on Flash, he could start asking questions. She'd also taken the time to scavenge for food, and was bring back a foot-long meaty sandwich that she hoped could be discreetly shared with Dodger. The mutt was a prisoner, forbidden to be fed, but Flash also knew that he needed to keep his strength up if he was to join her and Bruiser in the fight against Flint the next day. When she came through the hole by the door, she was greeted by the sight of an injured Jag. \"How's your pet? You're trusting Bruiser with him?\" he barked gruffly. \"You'll find Bruiser is wise enough to take his duties seriously, he's not going to push his chances with Flint any further.\" She carried on to the next room, where her captive was waiting. Dodger lifted his head at the sight of Flash. Did she have news of Rita? They couldn't speak openly while Panther remained in the room with them, but he searched Flash's face for subtle efforts to communicate to him. As Panther turned her head away, Flash caught his eye and nodded. \"Get back in your box, terrier,\" Flash growled, maintaining a show of hostility for Panther's benefit. She dropped the sandwich in the box, once more catching Dodger's eye. She whispered in his ear. \"Best wait until they are all sleeping. It's safer to eat in the dark.\" With a small smile she added, \"Your friend is coming for you.\" That evening, Fagin home to the barge to find that for a second time, neither Dodger nor Rita had returned home. In itself, it wasn't unusual ; they were not pets and comfortably spent time away from the barge, doing their own thing. What was unusual, was how on edge the rest of the boys had been in that time; there was a distinct air that something was wrong. \"Did you try Oliver's house?\" Einstein asked Tito, his ears drooping. \"Hey, I toldya, man! They're not there, they're not anywhere! Somethin's goin' on, man, I'm tellin' ya.\" \"I would not be so concerned, Einstein,\" Francis said. \"Considering their recent marital troubles, one can only assume that Dodger and Rita have taken the time to rebuild their relationship. They are sure to want some privacy.\" Einstein was momentarily placated, but Tito was unconvinced. \"Yeah, but when ya went round the warehouse, no one had seen Willow either!\" he yapped, \"I doubt she was invited to a love fest, Frankie!\" \" Fraaaahhhn-cis, you imp!\" Once again distressed, Einstein whimpered. \"But you don't think they're hurt or anything? Do you?\" Swallowing his own doubts, Tito leant on the Great Dane's huge toes. \"Don't worry, man. They're tough; whatever's goin' on, they'll be home soon enough.\" \"He's right, old fellow,\" Francis added, cooling down enough to try and ease Einstein's fears… and if he was honest, his own. \"You ought to ask Fagin for a story, that always lifts your spirits.\" Einstein's ears pricked up, and he jumped to get one of his many storybooks from his stash of treasured possessions. When his back was turned, though, Francis and Tito exchanged concerned glances. Unless Willow's simultaneous disappearance was just a bizarre coincidence, her being missing as well didn't fit with Dodger and Rita trying to work on their romantic relationship. Oliver hadn't seen them, nor had any of the dogs at the warehouse where Willow lived. It felt as though the three of them had fallen off the face of the earth; and no amount of telling themselves that their friends would simply show up home, completely fine and happy, would convince Francis or Tito. They joined Einstein at Fagin's feet, but could barely take in the story. Neither could quite shake the feeling that wherever Dodger and Rita were, they weren't fine at all. Huddled up under their tarpaulin, Rita and Willow lay awake, too cautious to make sound and too on-edge to sleep. For all either of them knew, the next day could bring absolute carnage. Rita could only go on Flash's word that Dodger would survive in there for long enough for their rescue attempt to reach him. Rita looked over her sister's quiet form, her heart heavy. Never had she wanted Willow to be put in danger for her and Dodger, but there wasn't a thing she could do now. Willow was stubborn, and now that she had Flash to fight for too, there was no way she'd back down. Rita didn't know if she'd ever loved her little sister more; after years of turmoil, Willow's true colours were shining through- something strong and beautiful that no one had ever appreciated. Draping a paw over Willow's back, and giving her a soft lick to the cheek, Rita willed the depth of her affection to come through without words. If they wouldn't make it to lie together for another night, they had this, and they had now. The dark shadow of fear and uncertainty couldn't take that.[Chapter 22] Dodger was woken by a high-pitched yelp. Jumping in surprise, he felt a sharp pain in his foot, where Flash had given him the deep bite two days ago. It still struck him as strange that he was now relying on the very same dog to orchestrate his escape, but, frankly, his position was such that he'd take allies wherever he could find them. Silently, he listened to the altercation in the other room, that had split through the quiet of the morning. Dogs were milling around, shouting and barking, and one was screaming and yelping as if being attacked. Beside Dodger, Flash lifted her head and growled. \"Bruiser,\" she said quietly, \"keep an eye on the terrier for me, I've gotta check this out.\" The ruckus continued, until the Dane mix, Harper, crawled into the room, bleeding and crouching as close to the concrete floor as she possibly could. Flint jumped on her, shaking the scruff of her neck, before allowing the younger Comet to finish the disciplinary action. Dodger remained quiet, yet horror-struck. That was Comet's own mother he was viciously attacking, but why? Harper must have done something to earn Flint's wrath, but could their son be so loyal to his father that he'd show no remorse in his brutal punishment of his mother? Even with Dodger's own hard feelings towards the bitch he'd once called 'mother', he couldn't bring himself to even imagine sinking to such abject cruelty. \"Didn't I tell ya, Harp?\" Flint was laughing, \"The kid don't need you interferin'; he's got it all worked out. Best ya worry about keepin' yourself in ya place, ya dumb bitch, Comet don't need ya no more.\" He spat at Harper's quivering form, and skulked up the stairs. \"Comin', Comet?\" The young dog followed his father and leader, up to the second level- where only those in favour with Flint were allowed to set foot. With the leader gone, Flash came to Harper's side and licked her wounds, while young Star joined them, whimpering in distress and with her tail tucked against her belly. Feeling sick, Dodger had to look away. It couldn't be clearer that it wasn't just himself in desperate need of a way out, but Harper, Star, Flash and Bruiser too. Bruiser poked his big head into the crate that had become Dodger's prison cell. \"She's in- Star too,\" he whispered, \"and it's happenin' tonight. We can't wait any longer.\" Dodger gave a nod of acknowledgement. The coming confrontation terrified him; it wouldn't just endanger the lives of himself and his closest friend, but Willow as well, and the friends he'd reluctantly made whilst being held captive. He couldn't imagine a way out that didn't involve bloodshed; for all he knew, the next day could completely change life as he knew it- or take it away completely. The sound of heavy pawprints told him that Harper was limping back to the place where she'd been sleeping not so long ago. He doubted Flint would take her out with the rest of the gang, which, unbeknownst to the tyrant, would work in favour of those planning to overthrow him. Flash returned to Dodger's side. \"She'll live,\" she whispered, \"and given some rest, she'll be able to join us.\" Muffled voices- laughter- told them that Flint and his close allies were now wide awake and ready to face the morning. It wouldn't be long before the main group would embark on their daily maraud of this part of the city, tightening Flint's grip of fear through brutal intimidation. An injured bitch like Harper would have no place in such a band, but then, Dodger wondered, did that mean the potentially dangerous Jag would also be left behind- right when plotting would become truly vital. He was powerless, unable to even speak while the risk of being overheard was present. Any sign that he'd befriended his guards would prove fatal, and he knew it. By the time the sun was high in the sky, all of Flint's gang aside from Dodger's guards and the injured Jag and Harper had left the hideout. With Jag lying down by the entrance, Flash raised her head to speak to her allies. \"We've got to take him out,\" she said quietly. \"Overpowering him won't be a problem, but we'll need to get him in the prison crate, and fix it so he can't get out.\" \"I been thinkin' 'bout it too,\" said Bruiser, \"and I don't want him on Flint's side either. One number they are down is one number we are up.\" Dodger got to his feet, holding his mangled paw gingerly. \"If you're sure, let's do it.\" Neutralising Jag meant that he and his allies would be met with just six threatening figures to face when the big confrontation came; and despite himself and Harper being badly wounded, they were still part of an eight-strong allegiance, and the numbers would be in their favour. \"We'll need to hobble him,\" Flash said, \"he needs to be lame enough that he won't be a threat, even when Flint returns. Feeling the effects of his own 'hobbling', Dodger blanched at the thought. It was extreme, cruel even, but this wasn't about being fair, it was about getting out alive. Harper whined. \"Shouldn't we give him a chance to work with us?\" \"No,\" said Bruiser, firmly. \"He is not to be trusted; he'd never betray Flint despite what he might say to save his own hide.\" The four dogs rose together, ready to confront Jag. Upon hearing footsteps, Jag looked around, and snarled as he saw Dodger walking alongside Flash, Bruiser and Harper. \"What is this?\" he growled dangerously. Flash spoke, collected and unafraid. \"This is a challenge. We're rising up against Flint.\" \"You fools, you're going to get your stupid throats torn out!\" he spat, but could then say little more as Bruiser threw his considerable bulk at him, pinning him to the floor. With Bruiser holding down the screeching Jag, Flash waded in and ferociously tore at the bull terrier's foot, until the pad hung limp in a bloody mess, just as she'd done with Dodger. The attack had been easy; Jag was already wounded, and both outnumbered and outmuscled. Harper looked on, shaking, while Dodger assisted his guards in dragging the struggling bull terrier to the prison crate, where he'd be able to be securely trapped. The three of them were panting as they returned to the front room. They'd passed the point of no return, and would be faced with Flint's wrath sooner or later. Dodger looked to Flash. \"We should bring Willow and Rita here- and Charlie. We'll be able to deal with Flint an' his followers as they come home; we'll have total possession of the hideout.\" \"I think you're right, terrier,\" she said. \"I'll go to them. Make sure there's no way of Jag getting out.\" \"He's got two useless feet; he's not goin' anywhere… or fightin'.\" Flash sighed. \"Just as well; when Flint gets back, there's gonna be carnage,\" she said, darkly. Flash led Rita and Willow close to the hideout. \"I'll have to leave again to find Charlie, but the sooner you're with the main group, the better. We don't know when any of the others will be back, and when they are, things are going to get messy.\" Willow shuddered, and Rita nudged her shoulder encouragingly, though she herself felt downright ill with apprehension. Then, as they rounded on to the hideout, a familiar face appeared at the entrance. \" Dodge! \" Rita ran forward, paying no heed to the fact that this could all have been a trap, whatever faith Willow had in Flash. All she cared about, was the fact that her friend was finally within reach. \"Well, ain't that a face for sore eyes,\" Dodger said with a smirk. Whatever bad feeling there had been between them meant little when their backs were against the wall. He'd hurt her, but Rita was still fighting for him; and he loved her all the more for it. Even still, he didn't dare try and push his luck with too much outward affection. Rita glared in through the doorway, taking in the sight of Bruiser, with him she'd already had a none-too-pleasant encounter, and the frail-looking Harper. Her eyes travelled down, onto Dodger's savaged paw. Her fur stood on end. \"Did Flint do that?\" she snarled. For the first time, Flash looked sheepish. \"On his orders,\" she said quietly. Rising to her full height, Rita bristled up to Flash, a look of disgust on her face. \"You vicious piece of…\" \"Rit, it's all right,\" Dodger cut across, appreciating his friend's defence of him, even if it wasn't necessarily helpful. \"She's been feedin' me in secret, can't do more for me without raisin' suspicion. It'll heal up.\" Rita looked deep into Dodger's eyes. Do you have any idea how scared I was for you? She saw understanding in his face, and it calmed her. \"I'll do what you need me to,\" she said, and then looked back to Flash with a softer expression. \"Are they likely to all come back at once?\" \"It's hard to say. Usually, Flint will be flanked by Stone, and recently Comet's been close as well.\" Harper whined, thinking of her son, and Bruiser licked her forehead, trying to comfort her. \"I don't want us to harm the pup, unless in self-defence,\" the bullmastiff said solemnly. \"It isn't his fault who his father is.\" \"Thank you, Bruiser,\" Harper said. \"I fear he's already in too deep to be helped, but I can't abandon him.\" Flash nodded, but Dodger wasn't so sure. That kid was a monster, plain and simple. He knew what he was doing, he just didn't care. It was painful to see the trodden-down Harper still so desperate to protect the son who had clearly been the source of much of her suffering, and it conflicted glaringly with his experience with his own mother. Simultaneously, he admired and pitied Harper. Willow, who had been quiet, trying to take in her rather alarming situation, spoke for the first time since coming close to the hideout. \"So, what do you want from us? Just to wait here and fight them as they arrive? Is one of you going to be taking on Flint?\" \"Bruiser will make a challenge to Flint,\" said Flash. \"He's the largest and strongest of us, and will have unquestioned support from Charlie. And yes, we'll let them come to us, and then fight. With you, we'll have the numbers, so there's a good chance at least one of two of them will simply roll over and surrender. Bruiser, Charlie and I will focus on Flint and Stone- that big white dog. The rest of you will hold off the others.\" \"Harper, you could even just guard Jag,\" Bruiser suggested. \"You're already hurt enough; no point in putting you at risk if we already have numbers.\" Willow secretly wished she could be delegated to hanging back, but said nothing of it. Flash meant the world to her, and if fighting would help, fight is what she'd do. \"And with that,\" said Flash, \"I'd better go and collect the last of our numbers. Charlie will be close, so I shouldn't be too long.\" She nuzzled the shoulder of her old friend. \"It's gonna be all right, Willow. Trust me.\" Rita, Dodger and Willow sat side by side, quietly surveying the surrounding area of run-down old warehouses and dockyards for any signs of movement. Behind them, Bruiser paced restlessly back and forth, waiting for the reassuring sight of his brother, safe with Flash. Had Willow not been there, Dodger would have taken the opportunity to really talk to Rita in the first time in ages. They were about to face a great danger together, and it would be better with nothing left unsaid. With Willow around, though, it would only dissolve into an argument, and that was the last thing he wanted. Rita spoke. \"We should fight in pairs, that way everyone with have some degree of back-up, whatever happens. Willie and Flash, Bruiser and Charlie, you and me.\" \"We have the numbers, so we might as well take advantage of them,\" Dodger agreed. \"And Star's gonna want to stay close to her mom.\" Just then, barking rang through the air; loud, aggressive hollers of fury. All heads lifted and wide eyes turned towards the source of the sound. Flint was onto them. Flash careened into sight, a red-sable bullmastiff at her heels. \" They're coming!\" she howled. Flint had seen her with Charlie, a clear signal that she was a traitor. Wasting no time, Rita, Dodger, and Bruiser ran forward, their hackles raised and tails held high. Willow, shaking, made a beeline for Flash, whose side she knew she wouldn't be leaving. Storming into the clearing on the docks, came Flint. His eyes were popping with rage as he charged to a halt, taking in the extent of the revolt. Within seconds, the muscular Stone was at his side, howling a threat to his enemies. Young Comet, followed by Panther, Wolfie, the little beagle, Nico, and then a petrified-looking Star came forward. None said a word or uttered a bark or growl; they waited for Flint. The tyrant lifted his head and sneered. \"I'll admit it Bruiser, you've got more backbone than I gave you credit for.\" He spoke smoothly, as though not even perturbed by the uprising; the danger in his voice quiet and subtle. \"It's a pity we'll soon be chewing on it.\" Flash stepped in front of a growling Bruiser, defiant. \"This is a challenge, Flint,\" she said loudly. \"You will hold no more power over Bruiser, or Charlie, or Harper and Star. We don't work for you anymore.\" Behind Flint, Star's eyes darted around. Where was her mother? Beside her, the others, bar the staunch Stone and Comet, were shifting nervously, aware that they were on the verge of a great fight. Bruiser held Flint's gaze. \"It's over. You can let us walk away, and there'll be no blood shed here tonight. I've slept beside you all for many nights; I don't want to end this with violence.\" The growl in his voice gave him a threatening air, but Bruiser knew that his boss would not be intimidated easily. Slowly, deliberately, Flint walked over, never taking his eyes off Bruiser's. Around them, the other dogs watched in silence, the tension stifling. Snap! Flint slammed his jaws shut around the bullmastiff's neck, and all descended into chaos. Bruiser screamed, but recovered enough to try and use his weight to his advantage. Around them, dogs were charging together, clashing in a mess of claws and teeth. Weakened by his existing injuries, Dodger was an easy target, and Comet quickly zeroed in on him. The young dog looked much like his father, but his coat smooth- and not yet marked by deep scars. He was young, but big and strong- and clearly had been raised from a young age to be a killer. \"What do you think you're doing, prisoner?\" Comet jeered. \"Had to be rescued by your girlfriends?\" He lashed out with his forepaws, easily knocking the lame and much smaller mutt sideways. Dodger rolled over, using agility to get the better of the much larger Comet. Even with his wounded paw stinging in the cold afternoon air, he could twist and turn. As Rita jumped into the fray, biting at the young dog's rump, it became clear that even together they were outmuscled; Dodger was wounded, and Comet was fit and energetic. Elsewhere, a terrified Willow was fending off the duo of Panther and Nico, while Flash desperately tried to intervene to prevent her vulnerable friend from being overpowered. What Willow lacked in fighting instinct and bravado, Flash had in abundance, and together they presented their opponents with an even match. With Stone and Wolfie taking on the resistance's strongest fighters in the form of Bruiser and Charlie, and Star confused, distressed, and trying to seek out her mother, Flint himself was unchallenged. The tyrannical leader purposefully strode into the hideout, intent on seeking his wounded supporter, Jag. Fighting against Comet's relentless onslaught, all Dodger and Rita could do was to try and keep moving, out of his firing line and away from his allies that would give him confidence. She'd been given the same memo Dodger had; to fight back, but to avoid going in too hard on the pup unless it became truly necessary. Quietly, Rita thought that they'd have little hope against the confident and vicious young dog even with their full force, and she gradually increased the intensity of her defensive attacks. Comet drove Dodger and Rita into a dark and rundown part of the docks, behind Flint's lair. The ominous creaking and cracking of wood beneath their feet as they continued to brawl could not slow down the fight. With a great heave, Comet finally managed to fling Rita off him, releasing the strong hold she'd maintained on the loose skin around his neck. Taking his opportunity, he then took hold of the smaller Dodger, and threw him hard against the collapsing edge of the dock, which gave way with the impact. With a scream of pain and a crack of bone, Dodger collided side-on with a piece of metal framework, and tumbled into the rough waters below. \" No! \" Rita yelped, running forward, helpless as she watched her friend fall. Hurling himself down into the water after his victim, Comet's eyes were hard and focused. As Dodger tried to recover himself, and drag his battered body back up to dry land, the young dog struck. Comet used his size in his favour, hauling himself right on top of the terrier, pushing him under again and again, totally ignoring Rita's attempts to fight him off. Her vision obscured by fur and splashing water, Rita at last managed to get a good hold of Comet, and positioned her whole body over his head and neck, forcing his face under. \" Dodger! Come up! Come up!\" she shouted, falling quickly into a state of panic, and struggling not to become dislodged as Comet tried to free himself of her. As the pup writhed, Rita fought harder, holding his head below the water with all her strength, while trying to release his grip on Dodger. With a gasp, and after what felt like a age, Dodger finally managed to break through the surface of the water, just as Rita felt Comet become still beneath her. Desperately trying to get back up onto the wooden frame, Dodger clambered over the limp body to get to safety. He panted as he shook the water from his coat, and looked back down to the water. Rita had stopped struggling, and was now catching her own breath against one of the metal supports. She appeared horror-struck, realising that the pup would not move again. \"He's dead. Just a kid and I felt the life leave him,\" Rita said softly. \"I killed him.\" She felt like a monster, a sick feeling rising up within her. With Dodger's own life at stake, there had been little choice but to be ruthless, but she couldn't shake the weight of what she'd just done. Her chest felt tight, as though something invisible was crushing her. She couldn't breathe. Dodger was still gasping for air. \"You didn't make him try an' drown me,\" he said, trying to comfort his friend. He himself had played a firsthand role in the death of Roscoe, but had never suffered guilt as a result. It was a natural response in the face of a threat, and a risk that was taken when living the life of a street dog. There was no point in getting all emotional. Dodger had held a faint hope that the pup would have seen sense and turned against Flint- for his mother's sake if nothing else, but it was his own choice, and Comet had just paid the price. The time to dwell on the wasted life was not now, when they still had their own lives to fight for. Pulling herself together, Rita scrambled up onto the docks. The sounds of a great dog fight were moving further away, and she knew that they'd have to move quickly to get to Willow before she came to harm. She gave a single soft whimper before following a limping Dodger towards the yelps that cut through the night air. What have I done? What have I done? They weren't out of danger yet, not by a long shot. All the same, Rita couldn't stop the agonised face of Harper, Comet's mother, from swimming into her mind's eye. What have I done?[Chapter 23] Following the sound of the fighting, Dodger and Rita came back around to the front of the hideout as rain began to fall. The main group had moved on, away from their home turf, in what appeared to have dissolved into a chase. Alarmingly, Jag was lying by the entrance, his jaw red with blood. \"Dodger,\" Rita whined, \"Harper…\" Dodger's blood ran cold, but they had to get to the thick of the fight, where they might be able to make a difference. Limping badly, he remained one step behind Rita as they moved into an area of increased human activity. They were jolted to a halt as they almost ran right into Panther, who came charging around the corner. Rita lifted her lip in threat. She wasn't afraid of Panther, but could not know what other allies of Flint- or even the dog himself- were not right behind her. Panther snarled in response, and was joined by a petrified young Star, who was sporting a nasty bite wound to her neck. \"You can stand down,\" she growled. \"I've left Flint.\" Her voice broke. \"He and Jag killed Harper. She was weak and no threat to them. My loyalty is gone, and I'm getting Star to safety.\" She stood closer to the pup. \"She's been through enough.\" That Star's brother lay dead in the river was too devastating to convey to her, and Rita could do nothing but nod in sympathy. Star spoke, her voice shaking. \"He killed my mom. He needs to be stopped.\" Neither Dodger and Rita knew what to say to the grief-stricken support, and could only hold eye contact for so long. The fight, going on without them, was now four-on-four, and their support would be vital if they were to have a chance of coming out on top. With poor Harper and her son lost, the fight was already going badly, and Rita was terribly fearful for her sister. The fight had sprawled into a builder's yard, a concrete and metal maze of hiding places and hazards. In the rain, the metal frames and structures had become slippery, and already Charlie had badly hurt his shoulder after missteps in pursuit of Flint. Bruiser ran to his brother's side, standing over him as Wolfie homed in, ready to take advantage of his weakness. Flash and Willow were left trying to fend off the trio of Stone, Nico, and Flint himself, and were flagging from the ongoing effort. Rita sprinted over, leaving Dodger behind; her eyes on her sister, who was in a desperate situation. \"Willow!\" she called, over the rain. \"Get away off of her!\" She launched herself at Stone, and secured her teeth around his throat. She could never overpower such a dog, but she'd fight for Willow until her last breath. Willow and Rita fought together, their combined forces holding back Stone just enough to remain in control, while Dodger joined Flash in trying to separate Flint from his final supporter, Nico. The smaller Nico was easily deterred, and he retreated to stand on the sidelines, egging Wolfie on as she continued to torment Bruiser and Charlie. With a great swipe of Flint's paw, Dodger was knocked down onto a lower platform, winding him, and leaving Flash facing her former leader, the dog who had controlled her for the past two years of her life, alone. \"You should have known you'd pay, Flash,\" said Flint, his voice soft and dangerous. With one swift movement, he took her by the throat and shook her. Down on the ground, Willow glanced up to see her old friend clawing at Flint, fighting for her life. Without so much as a thought, she pulled away from Rita and Stone, and jumped at the wall beside the scaffolding, launching herself upwards, where her wide-open jaws made contact with Flint's tail and closed hard around it. With an almighty lurch, he was pulled off balance, and in his surprise, released his grip on Flash. In what seemed like slow motion, he fell, along with Willow. As Flint cracked his head against a brick on his way to the concrete below, Stone let out an almighty howl. Her eyes wide with fright, Rita ran to her sister's side. Willow was stunned, unable to move as pain shot up the foreleg that she'd landed on. Stone nudged Flint's lifeless body, and realised it was over. Rage pulsing through him, blurring his sight and mind, he focused in on the two skinny hounds. That bitch killed Flint. Dodger, scrambling despite his injuries to get down to his friend, shouted over the top of the now pouring rain. \" Rit, watch out!\" But Rita couldn't run; not while Willow was left broken on the ground. She stood firm, howling a challenge to the sky. The proud and psychotic Stone did as she'd hoped, and took the bait. She ran sideways, and the great brute followed. Without anyone to hold her back, Rita could stretch out and run, fast bringing her pursuer into a busier area, with roads and cars- where she was more in her element. She could remain one step ahead of Stone, but there was no way she could fight him. If she kept him moving until the others caught up, they could drive him away from their injured friends. The rain grew heavier, and obscured her view. A distant yelp caused Rita to snap her head around; for a moment she felt herself slipping, and then… Stone's powerful body collided with Rita's as he slammed her into the sidewalk with all the force he could muster. Caught off guard, Rita hit her head hard against the concrete, and for several long seconds, everything was black. She came to a few seconds later to find herself pinned down, the attacker heavy on her chest, his claws raking into her side, and unable to defend herself from the huge dog. She felt a cold panic in the pit of her stomach; there was no escape, she could barely even move. She screamed and yelped as Stone savagely bit deep into the side of her face. Though her vision was still blurred from the force of the impact, and blood pouring towards her eyes, the heat of his breath on her face was terrifying, and told her with no uncertainty that she was now in too deep to escape. Dodger ran forward, forcing himself to ignore the crippling pain in his chest and side, and shouted out to his friend. \"Rita, watch out!\" He knew that she was much better equipped to deal with traffic than the vicious dog who had her pinned down, but what he had in mind still presented a huge risk. In a split second, he made the decision to trust in Rita's ability to get herself out of there. Dodger charged into them, knocking Stone off balance and leaving him stumbling into the road… taking Rita with him. Feeling Stone's hold on her slacken slightly, Rita wrenched herself free, tearing her ear with a great howl of pain. In a rush of adrenaline, she skilfully dodged out of the way of an oncoming car. Stone inadvertently staggered into the way of the vehicle, and before he had a chance to react, he was pushed under the wheel by Flash, who had followed Dodger's charge. Rita staggered back onto the pavement, her heart thumping, where she was met by Dodger who pressed himself up against her protectively. Dodger looked over to see the huge white dog dead on the road. Flash had left the scene, and was beside Willow, who was on her feet, stumbling into view. Exhaling in relief, Dodger put his head on Rita's shoulder. They were alive. It was all over, and they were alive. Panting heavily, Rita dragged herself to her feet. Her vision was obscured on one side due to a wound above her eye, which was bleeding profusely. Despite the pain, she felt relief that the ordeal was over and, in spite of everything that had happened recently, comforted by Dodger being so close. But Willow… where was Willow? \"You okay, Rita?\" Dodger asked, tentatively licking her cheek. \"Yeah, yeah I think so.\" Rita winced as she spoke. \"Is Willie okay? Are you…?\" \"Been better, but you should see the other guy.\" He smirked, but was stiff and uncomfortable in his movements, going to a great effort to mask the pain. By charging to Rita's rescue, he'd pushed his battered body to its limits, and he was feeling it now. \"Willow's on her feet. Flash has got her covered.\" Bruiser came around the corner, supporting a limping Charlie. \"It's over,\" he said. \"Wolfie and Nico ran off once they realised Flint had died.\" His expression was akin to someone who'd been hit by a bus, completely stunned. For a little while, no one knew quite what to say, taking in the weight of everything that had just happened. Harper was dead, killed by Flint and Jag. Flint and his staunchest ally, Stone, had died in the final confrontation. Though only Dodger and Rita knew exactly what happened, Comet was gone too. \"Did Star get away? And Comet?\" Charlie asked, his head cocked. That awful, sick feeling returned to Rita's stomach. \"Comet went down in the river,\" she said, ignoring the searing pain in her head and the fall of rain. All that seemed to fall away as her mind took her back to the horrific struggle in the water. \"He was holdin' on to the death,\" Dodger added hastily. \"An' Star went off with Panther, I think she's all right.\" Bruiser hung his head. \"It was probably for the best,\" he said sadly. \"Flint really screwed that kid's head up.\" \"I guess it's some small mercy that Harper had to come to terms with his death,\" said Flash. \"I really thought we were going to get her away from Flint…\" Willow nuzzled her friend's side. \"We did our best. Her daughter's safe; that would have meant everything to her.\" \"We'll have to track her down tomorrow, make sure she's being taken care of. She didn't ask for any of this.\" Rita, feeling increasingly dizzy, knew that she and Dodger needed to get home soon; her wounds were severe, and the bleeding hadn't slowed. \"Willie, are you gonna go with Flash? I need to get back to Fagin; he's gonna be worried sick.\" \"Yes,\" Willow said, and then looked back, pleadingly, to Flash, \"if that's not a problem.\" A broad smile came to Flash's tired face. \"I wouldn't want it any other way. I've missed the hell outta you, Will. We'll keep you fed up 'til your leg heals.\" Rita's gaze shifted to Willow's foreleg, which she was holding awkwardly. \"Honey, you should get that looked at. It might be broken- and I'd get you right back to Flash once that's been fixed up.\" Willow frowned. \"I know you only want to help, but I'm not going near any human, and that includes yours.\" She paused. \"But you should get back to him; you've been cut up real bad there.\" Her eyes shone with concern. She didn't know much, but guessed that losing so much blood would be very dangerous. Rita opened her mouth to try to convince her sister, but thought better of it. The last thing they needed right now was to fall out. Instead, she busied herself with licking clean Willow's wounds; tender contact that until very recently would not have been accepted. She was immeasurably relieved to know that Willow hadn't lost her life in fighting for Dodger, Flash, and their friends. Rita knew that she could have never forgiven herself if Willow had come to real harm because of her. \"Come round Willow's place,\" said Dodger, looking to Flash and Bruiser, two dogs that just some days before he'd despised. They were family now. \"We'll catch up there sometime.\" He struggled to his feet, and winced as he took the first step on his way home. \"Sure thing, partner,\" said Bruiser with a wag of his tail. \"You sure you'll be okay, Willow?\" Rita asked quietly, still wobbling on her feet. She looked over her sister lovingly. It was hard not to see her differently after all they'd been through, and more than anything, she wanted Willow to be taken care of after what had been a harrowing ordeal. Rita still carried the weight of letting her down in the past, and she'd never do it again. \"I'm fine. You two had better get home, your human will be worried. Besides, I've got Flash with me now.\" Rita nodded, \"You take care of yourself. Thanks, by the way; you didn't have to put yourself at risk like that.\" \"Don't mention it. You're family, and even if I don't always like you, it means something. I'll see you later.\" Willow smiled. The feeling surging through her was strange- she was battered and in pain, but oddly she was happier than she'd felt in a long time. It was a connectedness to Rita that she'd long missed, reformed in the heat of the battle they'd fought side by side. Even if a reunion with Flash hadn't happened, she knew she'd not feel alone as she once had. She retreated back to her home leaning against her old friend, but feeling strong in spite of everything. With an appreciative glance over her shoulder toward Willow, and their allies against Flint, Rita started to walk beside Dodger. It was not far to the barge, but the journey would be hard. It was slow progress with Dodger badly limping and Rita feeling increasingly dizzy. It had been a long time since they'd really talked to one another, and neither knew what to say. Until walking away from Willow, she'd been Rita's focus and primary concern. Now, Rita was left alone with Dodger for the first time in a long while. The dreadful fight had confirmed to her that he still meant the world to him, but she was still unsure of the way forward. Thinking about it was more than she could manage; it took all of her focus to keep putting one paw in front of the other. After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, Dodger spoke. \"Thanks for everything, Rit; I know I don't deserve it after how I treated you but-\" he said quietly, his head held low. Rita cut him off, knowing that she had to speak while she could physically manage it. \"No matter what stupid thing you might do, you're still my best friend. After everything we've been through, all those times when you've made everything better without even knowing, I'll always fight your corner. I love you, Dodge. You should know that by now.\" Rita sat down again, feeling faint. The hurt that Dodger had caused her seemed so insignificant now, overshadowed by the gratitude and protectiveness she felt for him. She wondered if the knock to her head had addled her judgement, but still Rita knew that whatever he'd done couldn't be enough to make her walk away from everything they'd shared. The relentless downpour of rain washed blood from her coat, but still it wouldn't stop. She was injured and weak; should the worst happen and her wounds overcome her, she would part with Dodger as a friend- as it should be. \"I really thought I was done for back there; I owe you big time.\" She gave a feeble smile and bumped her head against his lovingly. \"Hey, without you- well, you and Wills, I wouldn't have stood a chance. I reckon we're even.\" He sat down beside her, resting for a moment. They were almost home, but the short distance remained daunting. Dodger could tell that Rita was getting weaker, and was torn between pushing to get back to the barge as soon as possible and letting her set the pace. A quick rest stop wouldn't hurt. He looked into her tired eyes and moved closer to gently lick her wounded cheek, which, worryingly, was still bleeding. \"'Course I know it, Rita. I wasn't born yesterday. I love, ya, babe. I've never felt this way about anyone else, and I'm never going to.\" Rita smiled, and rested her head on his, her eyes closed. She tried to ignore the throbbing pain in her head, and held in a groan. \"You know, baby, it's not so much that I was jealous. I'm not stupid… I know that what you did with those women meant nothing. But I needed you that night, and you didn't need me… and you didn't want me.\" She slumped down further, exhausted and struggling not to collapse to the ground. It was hard to focus on her surroundings, the world appeared to be spinning. \"It hurt that you couldn't tell me what you were feeling, and you didn't even give a second thought to what I was going through.\" \"It was a mistake,\" Dodger nudged Rita back to her feet, anxious to get going. He winced in pain at the movement. \"I thought I'd feel better if I let myself completely forget about everything. I figured out pretty quickly that it doesn't work. I'm sorry, Rit. Guess I had to learn the lesson the hard way.\" They stumbled onwards. It was too much effort to keep speaking, so Rita instead clumsily nuzzled Dodger, letting him know that all was forgiven, and that their bond remained strong. Understanding, Dodger returned the gesture, and slowly limped along beside her. If nothing else, they were friends again, but the relief that Dodger felt was tainted by worries over their current predicament- in truth, he couldn't see how Rita could carry on much longer; it looked to him as though she was on the verge of passing out. Finally, they came close to the barge. Relieved, Rita lay down, and the dizziness subsided just a little. She was still losing blood from the deep wounds on her cheek and above her eye, and from her mangled ear; and with each minute she lost more of her strength. Dodger sat down next to her, shivering in the rain, and beginning to get truly scared. He hoped that they were near enough to home that they could call for help without being picked up on by dangerous strangers. He didn't feel comfortable in leaving Rita to go and bring the others; he couldn't get to the barge quickly while he was limping so badly. Dodger barked loudly, praying that his calls would be heard quickly so there would be no need to get her up and moving again. Rita joined him, howling weakly. It was a long while before there was any sign of help coming, and Dodger came close to pushing forward, but then Tito appeared with the others a little way behind him. \"You took your time!\" called Dodger, feeling as though he could sing with relief. Tito's eyes were wide as he met with his friends, both of whom were bloodied. \"Whoa, man! What happened to you?\" \"Oh no, have you two been fighting?\" asked Einstein, sadly, \"I thought you were friends.\" Dodger couldn't help but laugh. \"You really think we've been beatin' each other up? Come on, Einy, I'd never lay a paw on her-\" \"Not in aggression anyway…\" Rita mumbled with a weak smile. \"It was Flint-\" \"Good grief!\" exclaimed Francis. \"Surely not?\" \"He saw me with Evie last week, thought he'd teach me a lesson. Bit off more than he could chew with me and Rita though,\" Dodger grinned. \"You took down Flint? Man, you're bad!\" yipped Tito, bouncing up and down. \"How d'ya do it, man?\" \"Yeah, I know it's impressive an' all, but can you bring Fagin round? I can hardly walk, and Rita...\" Dodger tailed off, looking down at the injured hound who was looking worse than ever. He couldn't lose her now; not after they'd survived two great fights for their lives, not after they'd made it all the way home. Rita rested her head on the ground, exhausted. Her friends standing in front of her appeared to blur into one another. She spluttered and coughed as blood ran into her mouth. Alarmed by Rita's poor state, Einstein hurriedly ran back to the barge and dragged Fagin outside by his sleeve, while Dodger and Francis tried to clean her face so she could breathe easier. Fagin was shocked by the sight of two of his loyal companions battered, bloodied, and in Rita's case, barely conscious. Frantically, he bundled Rita into his coat and carried her to the scooter, where he wrapped a scarf tight around her head to stop the bleeding, before coming back for Dodger. The rest of the gang piled in after them, and together they sped off in search of help.[Chapter 24] Rita slowly awoke, exhausted and disoriented. For a long while, everything felt hazy, but gradually, her vision became clearer, and she could try to take in her unfamiliar surroundings. Her initial uncertainties were soothed by Dodger's scent; he was near her, and they'd both come through the ordeal. Rita realised that she was in a cage, lined with a soft blanket and looking out into a sterile, strange-smelling room. There were dogs all around her; strangers, save for Dodger. Several were whining. She could only come the conclusion that she was at the vet, an experience that was all new to her. The pain in her head and ear had dulled, and the blood that had darkened her coat had been cleaned up. Tentatively, she tried to move, and found her body sluggish to respond and heavy. \"Rita?\" came Dodger's hushed voice. \"That you?\" Not sure if she was awake enough to form words, she nonetheless tried. \"Hey,\" she managed to slowly get out, \"I'm okay. You?\" \"Fine. Turns out I had a couple a' broken ribs, an' they sewed up that nice hole Flash put in my paw. Ya sound like ya just woke up.\" The sound of Dodger's voice was more comforting than she could say, and for the time being, Rita wasn't up to saying much at all. \"Still comin' round. I can't remember anything. We were outside the barge, and then… nothin'.\" Dodger, still recovering from the drugs in his own system, gave a wide yawn. \"How 'bout I bring ya up to speed? Ya really scared the hell out a' Fagin; he thought you could drop dead right there. Ya looked pretty grim. He took us to Oliver's, and Winston gave us a lift to the vet. He's probably still moppin' up the blood from the back seat of the limo!\" He gave a weak laugh. Dodger would not say it, but that night had been a hellish experience for him. It had looked to him as though Rita was slipping away; he'd felt her grow weaker with every minute, and her breathing had been terrifyingly shallow by the time they reached help. He suspected it had been touch and go, and was profoundly grateful that he'd been unconscious himself through what would have been an agonising wait for news. Dodger had woken to Rita's scent in the air beside him, and from that moment, all was right in the world. \"I'm pretty sure Fagin's takin' us back to Oliver's in the morning.\" Rita was quiet for a little while, trying to regain her sense of all that had gone on. So much was a swirling haze in her head. She remembered being pinned down by the enormous white dog, Stone, and she remembered feeling a young dog die beneath her paws, but most of the fight was a blur. \"Did you see him at all… Ollie… before we got here?\" \"Yeah. Poor kid looked freaked when he came downstairs and saw us. Didn't get a chance to say much; you were, well, half-dead, so I was a little preoccupied.\" \"Guess that's why I don't remember much.\" Rita yawned widely. The pain to her head was not as sharp as it had been, but it was there, quietly throbbing away. She assumed that the vet had given her something so it would not hurt so much. \"I'm assuming Evie kept away from all the drama. I wanna talk to her, you know. She must be so distressed.\" Dodger found himself yawning too. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so tired; the relief of his ordeal with Flint being over was huge, but the weight of it all had clearly caught up with him. He hadn't slept properly in days, and had eaten only pitiful scraps. Taking in and registering what Rita was saying took all the concentration he could muster. Drained, exhausted, spent; he nonetheless wanted to talk with her. It had been weeks since he really had, and since then, everything had changed. \"I'll bet. Poor kid's prob'ly blamin' herself. Good thing ya didn't die, huh?\" \"I didn't realise it was as bad as that,\" Rita said quietly. \"I just remember feelin' dizzy. I need to talk to Evie, I gotta talk to her…\" \"Hey, it's all right, babe. Fagin woulda' let 'em know we both came through okay.\" He yawned again. \"You oughtta get some sleep.\" Rita felt relief. Her eyelids were heavy, but she'd been forcing herself to remain awake to feel close to Dodger. His presence was comforting, especially as flashes of the night before… the violence and the fear, came back to her with every minute that she regained her senses. They'd both been pushed their limits, physically and emotionally. \"I think you're right. You too actually, you can't have slept well with Flint breathin' down your neck.\" His head laid down against the soft blanket that lined his cage, Dodger closed his eyes. \"See ya tomorrow, Rit.\" Coming back from the vet after the overnight stay, Dodger winced at every movement of the dilapidated tricycle. His broken ribs were now supported by an unsightly bandage, but it didn't stop the smallest jolts from giving painful twinges. Another bandage was wrapped around the deep gash in his hind paw that had needed stitches. Miserable with his appearance of being beaten down, Dodger figured he'd have talk the whole thing up a bit to impress the others. Rita was sat beside him, still groggy from the anaesthetic she'd been given at the vet, as she'd been out cold for rather longer than Dodger had been. They'd had the chance to look one another over properly, and it transpired that Rita's deep wounds had been sewn shut, and her ravaged ear pieced back together. It was sore, but she was well aware that she could have come off a whole lot worse; that Dodger had been genuinely frightened for her was obvious, and it did a lot to put things in perspective. Since their brief exchange in the vet cages, they'd said little, but the recent tension between them seemed to have disappeared. At least, Dodger thought, near death experiences were good for something. He put his head on her shoulder affectionately, and she smiled slightly, not pulling away as he still half expected her to. As they stumbled through the Foxworths' door, close on Fagin's heels, they were greeted by the gushing of a concerned crowd. Oliver had been up all night with his friends, frantic, blaming himself for Dodger's getting in hot water with Flint's gang, and Einstein, Francis and Tito had spent a fretful night pacing and fearing the worst. Bubbling over with relief and excitement, everyone was clamouring to get the full story on what had gone down, and Rita happily left it to Dodger, who would no doubt be thrilled to have a chance to show off. It was nice to have their friends around them again, but Rita struggled to focus on what anyone was saying. The loud voices came crashing down on her, but little meaning came through. \"Hey kid, you don't mind if I go and lie down somewhere?\" Oliver nodded, \"'Course, just stay downstairs- Jenny's mom doesn't want you guys hanging around the baby.\" \"Are you all right?\" Francis asked, worried by his old friend's drowsiness. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\" Rita replied, staggering to her feet, \"I just need some quiet, that's all.\" She retreated to a spot underneath the grand piano, where she could still see and faintly hear the others. She lay down, curled into a ball and almost instantly drifted to sleep. Rita woke to find the room quiet, and the other dogs having made themselves scarce. She stretched and looked around, trying to get her bearings. Pulling herself to her feet, she set herself to the conversation she knew she had to have, with Evie. She quietly padded through the house, coming to the library- a quiet spot that she knew Evie was prone to hiding out in. From up on the highest shelf, Evie lifted her head. \"Hi,\" she said quietly, a sheepish look on her face. \"I'm sorry I haven't been out to see you; it's just been a bit much for me.\" \"Don't worry, kid, no offence taken.\" Evie avoided eye contact. \"Are you feeling okay? I know it's my fault, and I can't say enough how sorry I am. I know what he…\" She shuddered. \"I know how dangerous it must have been.\" Rita's expression remained kind and gentle. \"It's not your fault,\" she said. \"It all worked out for the best; you can breathe easy now.\" \"Is he really… gone?\" Evie asked. \"I mean, Dodger said… but I know he exaggerates…\" \"Flint's dead,\" Rita said. \"He hit his head. They're disbanded now; five of them turned against him, two of his closest supporters are dead, and that just leaves three- one of whom can hardly walk. It's over, sweetie.\" Evie dared feel heartened. Neither Dodger nor Rita held any ill will towards her, which was more than she felt she deserved. Still, now she really looked at the battered hound, there was something like sadness behind her eyes. Evie jumped down to the floor, and rubbed her fluffy body against Rita's legs. \"But are you okay?\" In spite of herself, Rita winced. \"I've been better, I gotta admit. I feel like I've been steam-rollered.\" She paused, and the vision of that pup becoming still beneath her drifted through her mind once more. Poor, frail Harper would have been heartbroken if she'd known what had become of her son. \"It was hard… emotionally. Stuff happened, stuff that I wish I coulda stopped. But, ya know, in an all-out fight like that, it's always gonna get messy. It's just a lot to process.\" Rita shook herself, letting it go for the time being. \"What matters is that it's all finished, and the world's just got a whole lot bigger for you. If you want to see some of it with Ollie, Flint's shadow won't be hanging over you no more.\" Tears formed in Evie's eyes, and before she knew it, she was weeping. Rita gaze the little cat a nuzzle. \"Don't you worry at all, child. It's all up from here.\" There was the sound of paws on the tiled floor, and to Rita's surprise, it was Georgette who she saw in the doorway. \"Oh! Hey, Georgie!\" Rita said, \"Sorry you've got all of us bargin' in on your space, it must be the last thing you want when you're already kept up all night by a new baby. I appreciate it.\" Georgette gave a smile, one that looked rather uncomfortable and forced. \"I don't have much choice in the matter,\" she muttered, then paused. \"I… uh, I'm sorry you got caught up with those crazy thugs… I didn't realise what Evie must have gone through.\" Evie stared. Never before had the poodle given her any indication that she cared about her at all. Something had changed. \"I guess you're lucky you never have to deal with dogs like that; you can't understand what you don't know,\" said Rita with a wag of her tail. \"I've got to be honest,\" said Georgette, \"you look disgusting… even by your usual standards. Do you want to use my mirror? I'm used to some serious grooming, I'm sure I can tidy you up.\" Taken aback by what sounded like a gesture of kindness from someone who'd looked upon her only with disdain in the past. \"Thanks, sister, but I thought we were keepin' down here so we didn't disturb the baby.\" Georgette ruffled her fur. \"I've put up with a lot with that screaming monster since it came home, but I am still in charge of what happens in my own boudoir. Come on, I'll fix you up.\" Rita came back down the stairs with Evie close by her heels. It was obvious that Georgette's attitude shift had made a big impact on the little cat, who had been nervous of her for months. Georgette had indeed been a dab-paw in the grooming department, and had tidied Rita's fur up nicely. The hair on her torn ear had been cut right back, even shaved in parts- but the worst was covered up by the long fur surrounding it. After the grooming session, her uninjured ear now matched the other in fur length, leaving her feeling light headed by the physical change. \"Hey, where you been?\" Tito yapped, bounding over. \"I thought you'd curled up in a corner and died, or somethin'!\" \"Tito, don't be stupid,\" Rita said, shaking herself. \"I've been with Georgette; she'd actually come down to look for you.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I bet she has,\" Tito grumbled. \"I was romancin' her real good, but crazy woman wanted to dress me up again- so I got outta there!\" Rita smirked. It always ended this way, but she suspected that it was part of the fun for both of them. With Tito freed up though, he could well be of some use for a change. \"Hey, you don't mind checkin' up on Willow do ya? She got hurt in the fight and might need help findin' something to eat, she wasn't walking too well last night. It'd get you out of Georgette's reach for a while.\" Tito groaned; Willow wasn't exactly much fun to be around, and if she was injured she'd probably be in an even worse mood than usual. Still, anything had to be better than one of Georgette's horrific makeovers. \"Take Francis too, you've both been cooped up all day.\" Dodger yawned as he walked over, Oliver at his size. It was only mid-afternoon, but the lack of sleep from the night before was catching up with him, and he was starting to think that Rita had the right idea in taking a morning nap. With Tito gone, Dodger's eyes fell on Rita. \"Ya holdin' up all right?\" he asked, \"I'm wrecked to be honest.\" Rita smiled. \"I'm okay. Still feel like I got hit by a bus, but that'll pass.\" She stretched out her lean body. \"I'm ready to crash out again.\" The group made their way back into the cosy sitting room. Dodger gingerly pulled himself up onto the window seat, leaving enough room for Oliver to curl up beside him. Rita lay against the arm of the large couch, while Evie perched on the top, high enough that she could avoid any canine rowdiness- though it appeared that, for today at least, rowdiness was the last thing on anyone's mind. Closing her eyes, Rita was just about to drift off when a troubling thought hit her. \"Dodge?\" \"Yeah, Rita?\" \"Are we gonna be okay? I mean, how are we payin' that vet bill? We're not gonna be in debt again are we?\" she asked, fearful, \"It's not gonna be easy to make ends meet with you out of action.\" \"Relax, baby. Winston's helpin' Fagin out, guess they're friends or somethin' like that. You musta been asleep for that bit.\" Dodger carefully rolled onto his side, and stifled a whine at the pain of the movement. \"When you're done restin' up you can take care of the troops for me. Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.\" Rita yawned widely, placated, at least for the time being. She considered Dodger quietly. Her feelings for him were strong, heightened by the very real fear of losing him that had hung over her in the past few days. The attraction was there, the affection was there, but the trust? Rita wasn't quite sure. She hoped that this period of recovery and healing would give her the chance to process everything that had happened, and a chance to come to understand what she really wanted from him. Einstein rounded the corner, his tongue lolling out after a game of fetch with Jenny in the backyard. Sensing that he was being left out, he bounded over, delighted to be in the fold with his oldest friends after what had been a worrying and traumatic night. \"Oh Rita, you're awake!\" \"Just about.\" She gave a small smile. The affection was plain to see in the old Dane's eyes, and following such a harrowing ordeal, it meant a lot. \"You must be pretty brave taking on twenty dogs like that,\" Einstein said, his eyes wide with wonder. \"Twen-?\" Rita looked over at Dodger, an eyebrow raised. Trust him to turn it all into a tall tale . \"Einy, I'm not sure it was quite that many, ten tops.\" \"Oh, no, Dodger said it was twenty-\" \"- at least twenty.\" Dodger interjected with a smirk. Einstein nodded solemnly, \"At least twenty. You must be sleepy and confused still, Rita.\" Rita shook her head in exasperation. \"Maybe I am. Time for another nap I guess?\" Einstein lay down on the floor between his friends, unable to fit onto the sofa himself. \"I'm so happy you're both okay.\" \"Thanks Einstein,\" Dodger said sleepily. \"But you shouldn't worry so much. You know it would take more than that to take either of us down.\" Despite several comfortable nights at the Foxworths', back home at the barge, Rita was still getting the sedatives out of her system. Never had she spent so much time fast asleep, and when she finally did wake, she barely had the energy to do anything. Having slowly tuned into the world, Rita's ears pricked to the faint sound of the television, and she silently listened in to the football game that Dodger was watching. By this time everyone had already left for the day, bar Dodger who had also been prescribed rest. The painkillers Rita been given had worn off, and her head was throbbing. She closed her eyes again, trying to block it out. \"Afternoon, sleepin' beauty!\" Dodger called from the couch, relieved to have Rita awake finally- anything to break up the monotony of staying home all day. Not being able to move around much was hugely frustrating, and even after just half a day, Dodger was terribly bored. How much longer he could stand this, he really didn't know. \"Sorry,\" Rita said, and then snapped a yawn, \"I'm not much fun right now, am I?\" She and Dodger had talked little; a part of her was glad of the excuse of still recovering when she felt small desire for conversation. The initial buzz of relief had subsided, and she was left with haunting memories. Dodger watched her sadly. They were friends again, but something still wasn't right. Rita appeared to be retreating into herself, stewing in an emotional storm. Such feelings were not alien to him, having a great deal to come to terms with himself. He'd come to care for his allies in Flint's gang, and it was difficult to shake the guilt, knowing that had he never been captured in the first place, she wouldn't have been killed. Scorched even deeper were the images of his mother, a cruel and careless figure that he'd been terrified that he was turning into. The result was that he doubted who and what he was, and he knew that Rita's confidence in him was not totally restored either. All he could do was take it slow, and be the friend she deserved. \"Hey, Rita,\" he ventured, \"do you think a lot about… about Harper an' her pup. You know, the one…\" \"I know.\" Rita grew tense at the mention. She'd been in more fights in her life than she could count, the fact that she'd killed another dog was confronting. When she first took to the streets, she'd been so determined that she wouldn't be overcome by the darkness that took hold of so many in what was often a desperate struggle to survive, but it had happened. It had taken a while, but it had happened. She pulled herself, staggering, to her feet, and sat down on the floor in front of her friend. \"I can't help but think of myself differently. I can tell myself I didn't have a choice, and my head tells me that's true, but…\" she sighed heavily, \"I didn't think I'd ever be pushed that far.\" \"Tha's understandable. I know it ain't the same, but I've been blamin' myself for what happened to Harper. She was too weak to fight; we shoulda got her outta there.\" Dodger stifled a whine; saying it out loud was almost more than he could bear. \"At least she never knew what happened to the pup… some small mercy.\" The two of them sat in silence for a long while, sharing the guilt and grief and feeding off the wordless support that each offered the other. No one else could possibly understand, and now that Dodger and Rita were finally alone together, their inner turmoil could begin to be let go of. Dragging himself to the present, Dodger looked at Rita, seeing the pain in her face, the same pain he himself could hardly contain. \"Old Harper, ya know, she knew her daughter was gettin' out of there- gettin' away from Flint. That kid woulda been broken by her crazy dad, just like Comet was. The old girl did what she could with what we had, right? And I think part of her would be grateful Comet won't ever just become another Flint.\" \"When you and me have kids, we'll do better, right?\" Dodger said, his old cocky grin returning to his battle-worn face. \"Keep 'em outta trouble.\" Rita found herself taken by surprise, jolted from the daze she'd been existing in. This had to be the first time he'd talked about having puppies of their own. She recovered quickly. \"Darlin', I'm not gonna doubt your ability to keep anyone outta trouble, but I'm really not in the baby makin' zone right now. You don't mind?\" Dodger's smirk turned to a look of tenderness. He edged over, inviting Rita to lie with him. Saying nothing, he met her eye. She understood, and walked over to the couch, coming close so that her nose almost touched his. Once more, their eyes locked, and then her gaze shifted to his mouth. Dodger felt his body relax, feeling warmed from deep within by their intimacy… a sensation he'd missed so much. And then Rita was kissing him, soft and gentle. Up on the couch, Dodger and Rita spooned together, eyes closed. They were tired, hurting, and broken, but as long as they were side by side, they'd heal; they always had.[Chapter 25] Rita woke with a start, jolted awake from yet another nightmare. She had been back in the fight; Stone holding her down, tearing at her, his hot breath against her face. She whined, laying her head back down. It was to be expected; she'd suffered similar nightmares about Roscoe and DeSoto all those months ago, and they'd haunted her for weeks. She supposed these nightmares would be gone soon enough as well, or at least she hoped so. At least the vision of Comet's body had faded from the forefront of her mind… something to be grateful for. Fights were simply a part of life for a street dog, but this one had been more than Rita had ever experienced; the ferocity of it all, the feeling of losing sense of her own self, and the terror for two of the people she cared about most in the world. It was very clear that memories like that would not fade into the distance anytime soon. The sounds of her sleeping companions were soothing somehow; Fagin was snoring, as were Francis and Einstein. It was familiar, safe, and just what she needed to hear. Rita glanced over to Dodger's bed, where he slept soundly, apparently untroubled by the recent trauma. He'd bounced back mentally within the first few days of being home, or at least, that was the image he made a point of projecting, but physically he'd taken a real knock. It'd be a while yet before Dodger could be back out leading the gang, and it was obviously causing him great frustration. Rita felt for him, but more than anything was grateful that he was alive at all- most dogs who got on the wrong side of Flint didn't live to tell the tale. In the few days that they'd been resting at home, Oliver had visited them, often Einstein had stayed back to provide some extra company, and there was a television set for some semblance of occupation, but there were only so many hours one can stare at the same walls and not become terribly bored. Einstein's staying home on occasion had been appreciated, but they really needed his contribution to finding enough to eat. It had become very clear that he was deeply upset by almost losing two of his closest friends, and Dodger and Rita had been told of his distress and utter confusion on the night that they'd arrived back, bleeding and limping, at the barge. Einstein was more fragile than his size belied, and making sure he was well emotionally was a high priority. By now, Rita really didn't need to rest any longer, her wounds unlikely to be disturbed by running around the city, and the gang needed her to be up and working while Dodger wasn't. It meant she could give Einstein the reassurance he needed, whilst keeping the gang afloat. She'd always been a sort of second-in-command to Dodger- in his absence, even briefly, the others looked to her as a figure of authority. Rita took pleasure in the respect that her position in the gang gave her, but hoped the necessity for her being a stand-in leader would be short-lived; working the streets just wouldn't be the same without Dodger around. Most importantly, though, she'd finally be able to check in with Willow for the first time since the great fight. She'd been reassured that her sister was well, but Rita needed to be with her. The sun was coming up, which was just as well, as Rita didn't imagine it very likely that she'd be able to drop back off to sleep. Stone's image followed her around whenever she closed her eyes. To her relief, she was distracted from her thoughts by the sound of someone stirring. She smiled to herself. \"Morning, Tito.\" There was little need to look to see who had awoken; experience had told Rita that Tito was the first to rise each day, almost without fail. Tito yawned, \"You comin' out today then?\" He spoke slowly, his voice muffled- it was early enough in the day that he was not yet his usual over-energetic self, though it never really took long. \"Yeah, I think I used up all my sick leave.\" Rita stretched out and got to her feet, glad of the excuse to get up and get on with things. \"So I don't haveta visit Willow for ya no more?\" Rita shook her head. \"Nope, I can take care of that now,\" she said, \"I appreciate you guys checkin' up on her for me, I know she's not always easy to be around.\" \"How come your sister gets all the action anyway? Take me with you next time you go lookin' for a fight- I coulda taken them easy!\" Tito was on his feet now, jumping around and posturing proudly. \"Sure, Tito,\" Rita said, rolling her eyes, \"You wouldn't have lasted ten seconds, they'd have bit you in half. I don't know what Dodger's been tellin' you, but it actually wasn't a whole lot of fun.\" Tito was not convinced, and leaped around, putting on a fine display of his fighting moves culminating in a collision with Rita's head. Rita groaned, she'd hoped the Chihuahua would remain sleepy for at least a little longer than this. It was a cue to get up, staying in bed would only make her a sitting target for her friend's mock aggressive outbursts. Soon everyone was up and raring to go- except for Dodger, who ignored Fagin's call to get going. While the others happily milled around their master in the usual excitement, Dodger just sighed, readying himself for another long day. Oliver had said that he'd try and make it around today, but otherwise he could look forward to a dull stretch of doing absolutely nothing. \"You gettin' up, hon?\" Rita gently nudged at his side. \"What's the point?\" Dodger grumbled, carefully adjusting his position. \"It's not like I'm goin' anywhere.\" Rita felt immediately guilty for excitement in getting back out on the streets while Dodger was left alone in the barge all day. \"Why don't you just go around in the back of the scooter? You know Fagin would be happy to have the company.\" \"Nah, the kid might be comin' round today. I don't want to miss him.\" \"If you're sure.\" Rita nuzzled up to him, but it did little to change his miserable expression. The two of them had been intimate in these quiet days together, but doubts remained in her mind. What she needed was for him to trust her completely, as she was doing with him, but her deepest instincts told her that he was holding onto something, keeping something important away from her. Rita told herself that his moodiness was down to frustration, but that feeling remained. What future they'd have as a pair, she didn't know, not while Dodger was still holding back. \"Say 'hi' to the kid for me, okay Dodger?\" Dodger grunted, but then looked up. \"Sure thing, Rit. An' just go easy today.\" He managed a forced smile, just for her benefit, \"Later, babe.\" It was wonderful to be back in action after several days of sitting around in the barge, and Rita was revelling in the joy of being part of the bustling city. Francis, Einstein and Tito followed her happily, and by the time afternoon rolled around, they'd all eaten fairly well and had each brought Fagin -mostly useless, but no less appreciated- gifts. While it had felt odd initially for Rita to be running the show, it quickly became easy and she ended up enjoying it, feeling confident that she could keep things afloat in Dodger's absence. She heavily suspected that the usually bickering Francis and Tito would not be giving her such an easy ride if they weren't concerned that she was still fragile. Whatever the reasoning, she appreciated their willingness to work with her. As Rita had anticipated, Einstein stayed close to her, and admittedly, it gave her a feeling of greater security. There was no getting away from the fact that she was very visibly injured, and that it would make her an easy target for any street dog with bad intentions. It was hard to feel vulnerable, though, with a dog as large as Einstein standing proudly by your side. Appreciating his care towards her, Rita took short breaks from work to play with the old dog, which always ended with all four of them in a wild tangle of paws and claws- even with the others going that little bit easier on the wounded hound. Satisfied with the morning's work, Rita turned her attention to getting back to Willow. \"All right, Einy,\" she said, looking over her shoulder, \"I'll get you to just stay with Francis and Tito until they head back home. You did good today.\" Einstein wagged his long tail. \"Willow will be happy to see you,\" he said. \"I think she has been worried.\" \"Nah, man!\" Tito yapped, \"That's just how her face looks!\" Rita snapped her jaws. \"You watch it, Tito. We're talkin' 'bout the girl who took down Flint. I'd be careful where I was throwin' my insults if I were you.\" Brimming with excitement at the thought of seeing her sister for the first time in what felt like forever, Rita broke into a run, ignoring the sting of the wind against her wounds. She couldn't get there quick enough, and it wasn't just Willow she wanted to talk with; their allies in the fight were the only dogs that understood what she and Dodger had been through… and if anyone would know what became of Harper's lone surviving pup, Star, it would be Flash. Rounding the old warehouse, though, Flash was nowhere in sight- but Willow's long, flaxen fur stood out in the sunlight like a glowing halo as she waited atop a shipping crate, and Rita gave a long howl of delight. She charged forward her tail going around like an out of control windmill. \"Oh Rit, what did you do to your hair?\" Willow demanded as she limped towards her sister, shocked to see how little of Rita's ear feathering was left. Despite her forceful tone, her own tail was wagging, revealing how thrilled she was to see her visitor. \"Just one of the fun extras that came with my visit to the vet.\" \"See, this is why you shouldn't trust humans.\" Willow said, staring. \"You poor thing; you look like you got your head caught in a lawnmower.\" Rita shook her ears uncomfortably; truth be told she wasn't all too pleased with the new look herself- even after Georgette's attempts to tidy her up, and the shorter fur did little to hide her ugly, tender wounds. \"It'll grow back. Besides, it still looks better than when my ear was all torn up. What about you? You doing okay?\" A smile came to Willow's face. \"I'm alive, you're alive, Flash is alive, Dodger is alive. I don't think we could ever have hoped for more than that. I thought we were all gonna die, but I came out with the best friend I thought was lost to me for good. I can't sleep at night thinkin' about the fight, and my leg's still hurtin' like mad, but I don't feel so… alone now.\" \"I'm happy to hear it. I guess Flash gives you something I can't… but these past weeks I've felt so much closer to you. I don't want you to feel alone, ever. 'Cause you're not. I'm so proud to be your sister.\" Willow gave a squirm if ill-disguised pleasure. Their relationship had its ups and downs over the years, with feelings of betrayal on both sides. Beneath it all, though, Willow had always craved Rita's approval, for the elder sister not to be burdened by her anxious presence. As Rita bounced forward to give her a happy nuzzle of greeting, she no longer felt the need to hold back from reciprocating. \"Come on,\" Willow urged, \"Flashie's gonna be so happy to see you… and she's not the only one.\" The two of them headed indoors, and Rita was unnerved by the immediate turning of heads to get a look at her. The elder Athena was quick to notice what had captured the attention of her guests. \"So,\" the old Weimaraner said, \"finally, the other heroine emerges. You've got some admirers wanting to hear your account first hand.\" Rita looked around, stunned, while Willow chortled. An old friend, Tango, came forward. \"I didn't think a human-licker could have pulled off somethin' like that. You're crazy bad, girlfriend!\" Another dog, a white husky Rita knew to go by the name of Winter, rushed over. \"Blizzard's back!\" he exclaimed, talking of his long missing brother, \"He'd been in hiding from Flint all this time. I got my bro back 'cause of you guys; I owe you one, big time!\" More dogs gambolled around, tails wagging, firing questions and showering compliments and thanks. Flint's shadow had been cast far and wide over the dogs of this part of the city, and the news of his demise and the liquidation of his once powerful gang had spread like wildfire. After the crowd finally thinned, Willow gave a smirk. \"See, Rit? We're the talk of the town. It's kind of nice to be considered a hero rather than just the weird, quiet loner; makes a definite change.\" That Willow was comfortable with all the attention at all was, Rita was certain, a product of the boost of self-confidence Flash's presence had given her. She herself, however, couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with the heapings of praise. Rita knew her part in the destruction of Flint's gang, and it wasn't something she was proud of. And there was the horrible feeling of knowing that poor Harper's death was among those being rejoiced. Sensing her sister's unease, Willow nudged her towards the stairs. On the upper floor, it was generally respected that dogs could take respite from the heavy socialisation downstairs… which is why it had always been a first stop in seeking out the standoffish Willow. As Rita soon saw, it had become a favourite resting spot for newcomer Flash, too. \"It's good to see you, Flash,\" Rita said with a wag of her tail. The pit bull mix looked as tired and sore as Dodger, Willow and herself, but she didn't have the tension in her face that she'd carried while under Flint's paw. Flash grinned. \"Likewise,\" she said. \"We're the talk of the town, you know that?\" Rita shook herself, still taken aback by the attention that was coming their way. \"I noticed. It must be pretty full on for you guys around here.\" She paused. \"Especially since you lost friends that night.\" \"I have to remind myself constantly that they mean well.\" Flash spoke with a slight growl. \"But it is clear to me how much fear Flint caused; that they are feeling relief is justified.\" Choosing her words carefully, Rita broached a subject that had played heavily on her mind. \"Have you been able to find out what's become of Harper's pup? The black bitch took her away from the fight, but I've been wondering how… she must be in pieces, poor kid.\" Flash bowed her head. \"It's a heavy burden to carry. Knowing that I instigated something that led to her losing her mother and brother,\" she said, her voice hoarse. \"I know that she is with the black bitch, Panther, still. She's looking out for her. The others all ran their separate ways, which is good; it means it really is all over.\" The three of them talked together for a long while, able to share their ordeal. It eased Rita's mind somewhat to know that out of the carnage, there were brighter futures ahead for those left behind- even poor young Star. Even knowing she had Dodger to return home to, it was difficult for Rita to leave. For so long, she'd have given just about anything to have a warm relationship with Willow again, and the long-absent feeling of familial love was addictive. She'd be back the next day, and then the next. They both had a long road to recovery ahead, but at least they were no longer facing their troubles in separation. This was a new beginning, and Rita was left feeling stronger in herself, ready to face it. \"Anybody home?\" Rita called as she came down the stairs into the barge. The faint sound of the television was a giveaway- not that Dodger would have gone far. Dodger limped into view, and could only smile in spite of the boredom he'd endured all day. His old pal was back home with him, and he wasn't about to waste that time sulking… not after all that time he'd had been desperate for her to even talk to him. \"Hey, baby, you missed me?\" \"After all this time holed up with you, you didn't realise how desperate I was to get away?\" She strutted forward, and ran her tail against his side. If she was going to get past those barriers he had up, flirting could only help. Still unsure of the direction their relationship was headed, Rita was nonetheless determined to give it her all. Just as it was with Willow, this was a new start for this relationship, and it was all up to them. \"You'll be happy, your reputation has swelled dramatically since your heroic escape- I might have some competition as head of your fan club if the buzz doesn't die down before you're on your feet.\" Rita stretched out on the couch, Dodger by her side. He carefully wriggled closer to her, and licked her wounds tenderly. It felt nice, but still she sensed something beneath the surface, something that he wouldn't let her reach. She wanted her mate back, but was that really what he wanted? This wasn't a fling she was after, but a lifelong commitment, and she couldn't do that if he wouldn't let her in. She reciprocated, but couldn't quite relax, distracted by the nagging feeling that Dodger's mind was elsewhere. Frustrated, she pulled away. \"What? What is it?\" Dodger asked, his heart sinking as he realised it was not all going to be plain sailing after all. \"Don't ya know how sorry I am for screwin' everythin' up? I dunno what else I have to give if this ain't enough. I thought I'd lost ya for good back there, an' I can't lose ya again.\" \"I'm not tryin' to hold back, I'm sorry. I just can't help but feel you're keepin' somethin' from me, and honestly, I'm worried we'll just have another communication breakdown. You're everythin' to me, so if we're wantin' to get serious again, it has to be all cards on the table.\" She slowed, seeing Dodger's eyes cloud over, hurt. \"Baby, I just don't want us to fall out again. I missed you, you know.\" Dodger shifted next to her. It wasn't a subject he'd been keen to broach. They'd been picking up where they'd left off, and returning to the night of their break-up seemed to be dicing with danger. He knew exactly what Rita had sensed in him; his encounter with his mother that night had never been far from his mind, and he'd hoped events since would have put her off the scent, but Rita remained perceptive as ever. If he didn't love her so much, it would be more than just a little irritating. \"I get it. I woulda told ya, but after everythin' that happened, it sorta got swept under the carpet. What happened, well, happened on the night we found Einy. When I was off on my own being an idiot. I didn't think you'd want to go back and talk 'bout all that.\" \"Don't worry, hon; I'm over it. If somethin's botherin' you, I'm here, okay? Otherwise what's the point in us makin' another go of it?\" Dodger could think of at least one thing, but bit his tongue. Joking around could wait; he had something to get off his chest. \"All right, if you're sure. My mom was hangin' out 'round the warehouse. It took me by surprise, but I'm sure it was her- she looked exactly the same.\" He saw Rita close her eyes and shake her head, as if she herself were upset that he'd gone through it. \"That was the first time, wasn't it?\" she asked, sympathy showing in her scarred face. \"Since you were a kid… you would have only been about a year old.\" \"Yeah, first time,\" Dodger murmured, \"I thought I was well and truly over it by now, shows how things take ya by surprise. A part of me wanted to say somethin', but I couldn't do it. I froze up completely, like I was some pathetic, frightened pup,\" he scowled. \"Not that she'd probably even recognise me anyway.\" His frown faded as he looked into Rita's face, relieved to be able to tell someone after stewing alone for so long. \"Better than what I'd have done if I walked into that piece of garbage,\" Rita growled, resentment bubbling up for the dog who'd hurt her closest friend. \"Look, hard as it is, don't let it get to you. You know she must have been real messed up to have left you like that. It wasn't about you, it was all her.\" She licked his cheek, wanting to give him comfort somehow. Knowing how much Dodger would have been suffering, it was hard for Rita that she hadn't been there for him while he'd been dealing with it. Of course, that had been his own fault, but she wished it could have been different. Dodger sighed heavily, the weight of his burden catching up with him. \"Ya know, she left me just so she wasn't tied down with the responsibility, and I hated it, I hated that anyone could just walk away and not give a damn at all. But that night when I saw her, she was just like me; flirtin', messin' with strangers just for the fun of it, and not a care in the world.\" Dodger spoke quietly. It was not something he could talk about easily, but Rita had always been unflinchingly supportive. \"And I was doin' what she did; tryin' to escape from everything that mattered. It hit me bad.\" \"Dodge,\" Rita said kindly but firmly, \"There's a big difference between walking out on your tiny kid and having some stupid night out. Look, I'm not gonna deny it, you can be a jerk sometimes; but you've always taken care of your family. What about Oliver? You've been there for him no matter what, there's been nothin' stopping you from walkin' away if you wanted to.\" \"Aside from running off with those hot dogs, and then letting him get scared half to death by you guys when he followed me home,\" Dodger pointed out, a small smirk on his face. \"Like I said, you can be a real jerk.\" Rita grinned as Dodger batted her with his paw. He seemed to be feeling a bit better. \"But you're also loyal, and brave, and we all look up to you. You're not the leader of the gang for no reason. If it wasn't for you, I doubt I'd have survived past puppyhood.\" \"I am pretty great, huh?\" Adequately reassured, Dodger had slipped back into his usual smug tone. It was what he needed to hear; after a good dog lost her life in his escape from Flint, the feeling of guilt was only exacerbated by the thought that her sacrifice was in aid of someone who didn't deserve it. He'd been round and round in circles placating himself, but the support of his most trusted friend allowed him to close a door on that turmoil once and for all. That, he supposed, really was why they were better together. \"And you're not bad yourself. No matter what happens, with Einy, or anythin' else, we'll get through it together. 'Cause we're real family.\" \"Now, that's better.\" Rita grinned, and licked her mate's ear. \"We need The Dodge on top form, can't have you mopin' around here feeling sorry for yourself forever; not least 'cause Evie's waiting on you to show her all that she's been missin' out on.\" Dodger gingerly rolled onto his side. \"I guess I can paint a smile on for ya in the meantime… as long as ya ain't too busy gallivantin' to make up for lost time?\" \"You can count on it.\"[Chapter 26] Oliver was hanging out the window, looking over the cars as they jostled for position in the morning traffic rush. This day had been awaited for many weeks; the day Dodger finally took back to the streets after an agonising period of rest and recovery. It wasn't just a time of excitement for Dodger, though, with Evie having waited to take to the streets with the full force of the gang behind her. She felt she owed a great debt to Dodger, who'd faced down a most dangerous threat to keep her safe. While she didn't imagine she'd ever really be completely at ease surrounded by dogs, but the bond she now felt with the gang- and Dodger and Rita especially- had given her a greater sense of self-confidence than she'd believed possible after her ordeal. Evie looked at Oliver and felt a tremor of nerves. Saying that she was ready to face the city on a busy summer's day was one thing, but actually getting out there and experiencing it was quite another. Last time she'd ventured out, it had landed her friends in hot water with the demons of her past, and though it was irrational now, the experience had increased the young cat's apprehension. \"Relax,\" Oliver said, sensing his friend behind him. \"This is going to be fun. As long as you're with us, you'll be totally safe.\" \"Didn't they lose you the very first time they showed you around? Safe, my tail!\" Evie scoffed, but somehow felt better. She was going to be with friends, and there was nothing that could boost her confidence more. \"Like Dodger always says; 'when you've got your pals, you've got all you need'. And you're gonna have me, no matter what.\" Just a few streets away, the dog himself was dancing through his domain, not missing a single step as he slipped through the traffic; it was as though he'd never been away. Around him in a circle of wagging tails were the rest of the gang- united in the place where they belonged for the first time in two months. Running behind Dodger, Rita kept close to Einstein, whose increasing habit of absent-mindedly drifting away had to be kept on top of. She nudged his side, encouraging him down 5th Avenue, and towards Oliver and Evie. \"Dodger, hey!\" Oliver hollered, hanging out the window. \"Ollie,\" Evie hissed, \"be careful!\" \"Hey, don't worry,\" he said, turning back to her with a smirk so reminiscent of his canine friend's, \"I know what I'm doin'.\" Dodger bounced on the pavement, for one paying no heed to maintaining a cool composure; he was excited, and after the couple of months he'd just been through, he couldn't help but show it. He was quickly joined by Rita, Tito, Francis and Einstein, who were all feeding off their leader's energy and barely containing their own eagerness to get going. When Oliver tumbled out the door, he made a beeline straight for Dodger, and greeted him with an enthusiastic face-rub. \"I almost didn't recognise you without the bandage!\" he teased. \"An' how did I wind up smashed to bits anyhow? Whose butt was I savin'?\" Evie's small furry face appeared at the door. She peered out, her heart pounding. Had she waited too long to take this step? The world outside looked all too vast now that she was on the edge of stepping out into it. For Oliver, going beyond their own safe walls was nothing, and he'd never even think to hesitate. How she envied him. It wasn't just nerves that had her stomach doing flips either; she had not seen Dodger or Rita since they arrived back at the Foxworths', grievously wounded and patched up as best as possible. They'd almost died, and Evie could only blame herself. How could she face them? She bit her lip, suddenly struggling to fight the urge to retreat back to safety. \"Going somewhere, little kitty?\" A startled Evie jumped around to see the figure of Georgette, a figure who had been a source of grief for much of her stay with the Foxworths. \"G-Georgette… I was going…\" Georgette cut across her, as if forcing herself into something she knew she'd quickly talk herself out of. \"I've not really done this myself, either.\" She scowled, unable to believe what she was about to say. \"Why don't we both try something new?\" \"You want to come with me?\" asked Evie- once she'd picked her jaw up off the floor. \"I don't know if want is the right word… but yes, I'll go with you.\" Evie beamed, truly touched. Something had shifted in Georgette since the sleepless night several weeks ago, when the threat of Evie's past caught up with Dodger and Rita. The change had not gone unnoticed by the young cat, who suspected that the sheltered poodle had been given a stark reality check about the realities of the street life that Evie had once faced alone. \"That'd mean a lot. Thank you.\" \"I think -no, I know - I'll regret this, but, you're welcome.\" The motley crew set out all together, with Dodger proudly striding forward in the lead. Oliver was right behind him, while Evie was so close to her friend's side that they had to be careful not to step on one another's paws. Bringing up the rear, the reluctant Georgette was, of course, getting reacquainted with her part-time lover, Tito. \"So, they're… on again?\" Rita asked Francis, an eyebrow raised. The bulldog shook his head. \"I can only assume so; I have long since passed the point of following.\" Rita laughed. \"To be honest, I think he likes the drama of splittin' up and gettin' back together. Whatever makes 'em happy, I guess.\" She was quietly grateful of her own romantic relationship, which was now stable and easy. Having gone through a brief separation, she had no intention of it happening again, nor did a totally committed Dodger. They knew how to make their partnership work, and it could only go from strength to strength from here on out. \"Where are we going, Dodger?\" Einstein called from his safe spot by Rita's side. In the weeks since his misadventure, he'd not become lost once, thanks to the vigilance of his friends. His tendency to become disoriented hadn't diminished; if anything, it was more obvious now that everyone was actively looking out for it, but he was able to happily plod along without a care- with his pals around, there was no reason to worry. Dodger turned, feeling immediate satisfaction at the sight of the gang all together again. \"We're takin' 'em to Times Square. Nothin' like jumpin' in at the deep end. There an' back should be far enough.\" Evie didn't know what or where Times Square was, but she knew what 'jumping in at the deep end' meant. Suddenly anxious, she looked up to Rita, who was coming along behind her. \"There aren't… lots of dogs there, are there?\" \"Don't worry, child. It's not exactly dog central, but plenty of humans and traffic. Will give you a good idea of what this city's all about. But you can even ride on my back if you're feeling nervous.\" The walk wasn't a long one, but Rita found herself very busy ensuring that neither Evie nor Georgette stumbled under an oncoming car, in addition to making sure Einstein didn't wander away from the group. She had no doubt that Tito would be insulted and enraged if he knew she was looking out for 'his woman', but there was no way he'd have the physical capability of helping Georgette out in an emergency, so she subtly kept an eye out. When the group stopped to look out into the bustling square, Rita could finally relax. \"Here ya go, kid,\" Dodger said, stopping on a corner and gesturing to the bright flashing screens and chattering humans all around. \"Really somethin', huh?\" Evie gazed upwards, on the verge of a sensory overload. \"Woah,\" she breathed. It really was something, but she struggled to take it all in. \"Evie, are you okay?\" Oliver asked, concerned. He moved closer to her, so she could lean against him if needed. \"It's just so big.\" \"It's a lot to take in,\" said Rita, kindly, \"just sit and watch- see if you can get used to all the noise and activity. You don't have to go any further; you can even take a step back if you want.\" Evie crouched, Oliver right by her side, taking the time to get a hold of her surroundings, while the rest of the gang began to move off, showing Georgette a fast-paced part of the city she'd barely seen. As the little cat looked around, she realised what it was that those dogs loved about this place so much. It was loud, it was frenetic, it was dirty, it was bright; there was a pulsating energy that ran through the place, and the dogs somehow seemed to be totally in sync with it. How exciting, Evie thought, it must be to feel part of something so big. This must be why Rita called them 'streets of gold'. When Rita came by again, Evie was ready. \"Is it still okay if I watch from your back?\" the little cat asked, feeling brave. Rita crouched down to let Evie clamber on up. \"Just relax, kid. You're safe with me. Coming, Oliver?\" Oliver surged forward, weaving through the jungle of human legs, all the while aware of Rita just a little way behind him. He ran to join Georgette and Tito; seeing the pampered poodle out and about with the gang was quite a turn up for the books, and he wasn't going to miss it. \"See?\" said Dodger, \"You got this, kid. Piece a' cake.\" Evie smiled shyly, as Rita walked backwards across a zebra crossing, turned to chat with Georgette, who looked more than a little out of her element. \"Does Winston ever take you out this way, or is the park more his style?\" she was asking, comfortable enough in her surroundings that she needn't look where she was going. \"Once you get used to the hustle and bustle, it's fun; you'd never run out of scents to smell or sights to see.\" Georgette winced, another one of those 'fun' smells reaching her nose. \"The park is more our scene- though I've ventured so some of the high-end pet boutiques uptown. At least it's busy enough here that I'm not going to be seen by anyone I know…\" Laughing, Rita reached the other side of the road and began walking by the poodle's side, pride evident in her every step. \"Your secret's safe with me, sister.\" She winked. Georgette wasn't a bad sort really; they'd likely never be close, but there were the beginnings of a friendship there. That Georgette had made kind overtures when Rita was hurt had not been forgotten. \"I think Tito's your tour guide; he'll get you to all the romantic spots that your fancy suitors never find.\" Tito puffed his chest out proudly. \"I know how to treat my woman! I gotta show you a real date; I had baths for you- this makes it even.\" \"Ugh,\" Georgette groaned, realising that her giving in and being seen in public with the mangy little Chihuahua would only have strengthened his resolve to pursue her. Truth be told, though, she wouldn't have it any other way. \"I'll go out with you only if you have been properly groomed. Today is your exception, and that's just for Evie.\" From up on Rita's back, Evie was enjoying the stroll through the busiest parts of the city. She'd spotted only one other dog amongst all the humans, and hadn't felt fearful. Frequently, she'd look down to Oliver, and he'd look back up at her, always concerned for how she was coping with the adventure. \"Thanks so much for coming, Georgette,\" she said earnestly, \"I don't know if I'd have done it if you hadn't given me the last push; and I'm so happy I did.\" \"You're doing great, Evie,\" Oliver said, beaming up at his friend, who'd made him so very proud. There was sudden shouting, and Einstein bounded towards the mutt, a box of fried chicken hanging from his jaw and Francis running along behind. \"Looks like lunch is served,\" Rita said, wagging her tail. \"All right!\" Tito yapped, jumping forward, \"lunch is on , baby!\" Making a quick retreat back to the relative peace and quiet of the park, the gang settled down under the cover of foliage to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Einstein puffed out his chest proudly; he was old, but he wasn't ready for retirement quite yet. Georgette sniffed at the meal, unimpressed. \"You can't tell me that's not horrifically fattening.\" She winced imagining the impact on her figure. \"Baby, that's why it's so good!\" Tito crooned, already climbing face-first into the box. Dodger smirked. \"Relax, champ. I'm sure we can get this polished off without your help.\" Under the cover of all the shady trees and underbrush and with her canine companions settling down to eat, Evie could relax at last, and gambolled around the dogs' feet in an easy gaiety that had eluded her for so long. Oliver couldn't stop himself from joining her; all the while looking at her with utmost adoration. \"See how he looks at her?\" Rita whispered to Dodger, \"Our kid's growin' up.\" She smiled warmly, somewhat relieved that this foray with Evie had not been beset with panic as she'd begun to envisage. The little cat found security in her friends, and Oliver's growth into a responsible and caring protector had made all the difference. Rita imagined that as long as he was there, Evie could do anything. Dodger watched, and realised that his jealousy of Evie was now truly a thing of the past. Oliver had plenty of room in his life for friends, and what he had with Evie was something completely different. With Evie more confident and Flint out of the picture, Oliver would be spending more and more time living it up with his favourite mutt, and Dodger knew that things would only be looking up from there. Besides, it wasn't as if he was lonely- not at all. \"Growin' up, growin' away… guess I can live with it.\" \"You drive me crazy, you know that?\" Rita said, and she gave Dodger's cheek a lick. He just grinned, full of himself, but with ill-disguised affection behind his eyes. \"As long as you can live with a little crazy,\" Dodger said. \"You pretty much keep me sane, so I guess we're a perfect match.\" Rita stretched out in the grass, settling down to just enjoy being with her family in the place she loved. Living on streets of gold with her soft-centred daredevil of a hard man was worth whatever crazy might be thrown her way. She leaned her head against Dodger's foreleg and returned the grin. \"Honey, you might just be onto something there.\" ","Summary":" The late afternoon foot-traffic became hurried- even more so than usual- as the skies over New York"}]
