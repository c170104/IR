A/N: French translations available at the bottom. ~0~ Breathe in. Flap wings. Propel forward. Breathe out. Don't think. Breathe in. Flap wings. Propel forward. Breathe out. Don't think about it. Breathe in. Flap wings. Propel forward. Breathe out. Don't think about her. Don't think about her pain. Don't think about how you're not there. Don't think about the screams of pain she's probably belting out. Don't think about all the blood that's surely pouring out and staining the sheets. Don't think about the tears streaming down her face as she fights the pulsation of agony ripping through her body. Don't think about the fact that you're responsible for the battle she's fighting right now. Just breathe in. Breathe out. \"You're highness! You can't go in there!\" It was an accident. \"She needs me!\" They hadn't meant for it to happen. \"Cornelius, darling! Just let the doctors do their job!\" They hadn't put much thought into their actions. \"Listen to her! I need to be there!\" They were just caught up in the moment. \"And what are you going to do about it?\" Even after it happened, it took them a while to figure out the consequences. \"Just let me be with her.\" Who could blame them though? \"Your majesty, has anyone called her mother?\" They were still young, just coming into and understanding their responsibilities as young adults. \"No. Would you…?\" When the signs started presenting themselves, they called the doctor right away. \"I'm not going anywhere until I see Thumbelina.\" The doctor took his time, just to be sure. \"Stubborn boy.\" When he was, he delivered the news swiftly and without preamble. \"I'll take care of it.\" They were shocked. \"Thank you, my love. At least someone here is thinking sensibly. Child, stop pacing!\" Tabitha threw a fit when she was told. \"She's in pain!\" Colbert put a supporting hand on Cornelius' shoulder. \"Don't you think I know that?\" Thumbelina's mother offered her services if they were needed. \"This isn't helping anyone.\" Thumbelina shed a few tears as new symptoms as time went on. \"I'd be helping if I could be in there with her! She's alone!\" Cornelius could do nothing but give comforting words and embraces. \"She's hardly alone. The doctor is in there with her.\" Royal servants tried their best to make Thumbelina's days comfortable. \"As if she's anything but another patient to him.\" The royal guard worked overtime to keep the Vale safe during this vulnerable time. \"Of course, she's not just another patient! She's the princess!\" Common fairies couldn't help but gobble up any new news about the princess. \"And my wife! I should be in there with her.\" The news had been unexpected after all. \"Of all the preposterous things-\" It was just an accident. \"Your highness?\" A very happy accident. ~0~ Cornelius could barely hold himself back from running into Thumbelina's chambers. He hadn't been in the Vale when Thumbelina had to frantically call the doctor to her chambers. He wished he had been. In fact, today was the only day of the week in which he chanced leaving Thumbelina alone in their home – well, not really. He always had guards and a maid wandering around – to go out and just ride on the winds weaving through the trees' leaves. He even left Buzzby behind as a form of companion for Thumbelina when he took these breaks. The breaks weren't even his idea initially. They were Thumbelina's, actually. It came to her to make him go on relaxing outings when he wore himself sick once from all the hovering and worrying he did 24/7 ever since the doctor was first called to check on Thumbelina. He had protested the idea vehemently, and even managed to resist her subtle cues to go outside for a breather when he got too hassled for days afterward, but when Thumbelina and he got into an argument when she announced she was feeling smothered by his constant presence, and he took off to calm down before he said something he'd regret, he had to concede to Thumbelina's point. He had come back later that night feeling more at ease and with a clearer head, and a greater appreciation for Thumbelina's plight as she couldn't just take the day off from her ailments. It didn't mean he was entirely happy leaving Thumbelina, however. Hence, he and Thumbelina compromised on having a designated day of the week for these breaks. What a coincidence that it would be the same day he would be most needed by his wife, no matter what his mother said. When he finally lays his eyes on her, she's sweaty, sleepy, and sagging against the pillows behind her. Her face is red, there are tear tracks down her cheeks, and – despite how much the servants tried to cover it – he could see faint outlines of blood on the sheets. Even so, she's still the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. Her eyes opened when she heard him come in and she smiled. \"Cornelius.\" \"Thumbelina,\" he sighed out, his wings upturning from their downtrodden state, and made his way over to her side. He grabbed her hand and caressed her hands. \"Are you okay? Are you hurt? You're tired, aren't you? Where-?\" He looked around. Thumbelina cut through his rambling with a shout of his name. He turned to her sharply, expecting an order to get her something. \"Turn around.\" Confused he did so. Behind him was the doctor, smiling in amusement, carrying a bundle in his arms. Cornelius looked at the bundle in awe, while Thumbelina watched both her husband and the bundle with love. \"Is that…?\" The doctor walked closer. \"Prince, Princess, meet the new fairy princess, your daughter.\" The bundle was placed into Thumbelina's arms. She was beautiful. A perfect combination of Thumbelina's face and Cornelius' hair, Thumbelina's high cheeks and Cornelius' nose, Thumbelina's lips and Cornelius' eyes. Eyes the same shape and color as his, eyes that looked right into his when they opened sleepily and fixed upon the first thing they saw. \"Oh, Cornelius. Isn't she beautiful?\" Thumbelina sighed out happily, despite being tired and fighting the grips of sleep. Gently placing a hand on his newborn daughter's head, Cornelius replied, \" Une beaut é , vraiment .\" \"What shall we name her?\" He stroked her head. \"Liliane. My darling Liliane.\" He kissed the baby's brow, which was protested with a gurgle, making the new and proud father smile. \"Liliane.\" Thumbelina said, rolling the name along her tongue and liking the way it sounded. \"It's perfect. Welcome to the world, Liliane. I'm your Maman and this is your Papa .\" ~0~ Breathe in. Calm down. Don't listen. Breathe out. Don't look. \"Cornelius!\" Breathe in. Calm down. Don't listen. Breathe out. Don't look. \"Oh, come on, Cornelius!\" Breathe in. Calm down. \"Nothing is going to happen.\" Don't listen. \"It'd be better if you were watching her.\" Breathe out. \"Cornelius, look! Look! She's doing it! She's off the ground.\" Don't look. \" Papa!\" Oh no. \"Thumbelina, it's too early for this!\" Cornelius said, grabbing his daughter out of the air where she hovered unbalanced as Thumbelina guided her with her hands. Thumbelina, hands now free, crossed her arms and gave her husband a bland look. \"It is not too early. Your mother told me you were flying earlier than this!\" \"That's different, Thumbelina.\" \"How?\" \"She's my petite fille .\" Uncrossing her arms and resting her hands on her lips, Thumbelina pursed her lips. \"It's not like I'm throwing her off a tree limb and letting her fend for herself.\" \"I know that.\" Cornelius frowned, irritated. \"I'm holding onto her the whole time, we're standing on a soft petal, and I'm keeping her low to the ground. She needs to fly sometime.\" \" Papa !Me fly!\" Liliane giggled in his arms, waving her arms and accidently hitting her father's lips. He paused, and then, \"I'm standing behind her the whole time.\" \"Fine by me, Papa plus ch è re .\" Thumbelina changed her stance to smile happily at her daughter. \"Let's show Papa how well you can fly, petite amie .\" Minutes later, after Liliane successfully flew (slowly) from one side of the flower to the other, with only one near tumble from which she quickly righted herself without her father's help, Thumbelina smiled smugly at her husband. ~0~ Breathe in. Adjust hair. Check teeth. Breathe out. Smile at your reflection. Breathe in. Fix suit. Comb eyebrows. Breathe out. \" Papa ?\" Turn around. \" Papa , how do I look?\" \"Hmmm…\" Cornelius hummed, jokingly. He rubbed at his chin in a thoughtful manner, glancing her over. \"Well, you could do without that flower in your hair, and that color just does not suit you at all-\" His six-year-old gasped. \" Papa ! You said fairies don't lie.\" \"Who said I was lying?\" Cornelius smirked, before protesting at the swat his wife gave to his arm. \" Vous ê tes belle , Liliane. Almost too belle . Are you sure you want to come to the ball? We can always sneak away and fly off to the pumpkin patch by your grandma's house.\" He offered. \"Cornelius!\" Thumbelina said aghast. \"Oh, come on, amour. It's not like you want to go either. I told you those balls were more fascinating to the guests than the hosts.\" \"Even so,\" She knew he was right, \"we can't just run away, mari . This is a ball to celebrate our up-coming coronation in two days. How would it look if the stars of the show weren't present?\" \"It would look like we were doing more fun things.\" Cornelius joked. Thumbelina didn't smile. Liliane pulled on his shirt's tail. \"Will Christopher be there? I want to play with him.\" Liliane asked innocently. Cornelius mockingly put a hand to his chest, acting wounded. \"You want to be with Christopher more than me? More than your father? The one who raised you and changed your clothes and took you places and fed you ice cream behind your maman's back?\" \"Nooooo.\" Liliane moaned out, grabbing at her father's hands. \"I always want Papa . Christopher is just a friend.\" \"A friend you like more than me.\" Cornelius pouted, sitting down dejectedly. He heard Thumbelina try to cover a giggle. \" Papa silly. I love Papa , only like Christopher.\" Thumbelina let out an aww at that. \" Like ?\" Cornelius raised an eyebrow, pulling Liliane onto his lap. \"You're too young to like boys, missy. Besides,\" he put his lips closed to his daughter's ear, and whispered the next part, \"they've all got cooties.\" He lightly tickled her tummy, causing her to giggle. Liliane pushed at his hands, and replied, \" Maman says cooties don't exist.\" Cornelius shook his head. \"Mommy is lying.\" \"Your Daddy is lying.\" Thumbelina pipped up, walking closer, thoroughly amused at her husband's antics to isolate their daughter from all the boys he deemed a threat. \" Papa just wants you to himself.\" \"Of course, I do. You're both my filles pr é cieuses . I don't want any boys coming around and hurting you, Liliane. Ok?\" He looked into her eyes. \"You tell me if this Christopher character hurts you, alright? I'll give him a good whack to set him straight.\" He vowed. \"Cornelius!\" \" Papa !\" ~0~ Breathe in. Don't panic. Just search. Breathe out. \"Liliane!\" Breathe in. Don't panic. Just search. Breathe out. \"Liliane, where are you?\" Breathe in. Don't panic. Just search. Breathe out. \"Liliane, please answer me! Liliane!\" Breathe in. Don't panic. You'll find her. Breathe out. \"Liliane, can you hear me?\" Breathe in. She's okay. She's only lost. Breathe out. \"You're doing great, Buzzby. Let's search over there.\" Breathe in. This isn't the same as last time. It's not winter. Breathe out. \"Cornelius! She's not here!\" Breathe in. You have others helping you look. You've taught your daughter how to fight. Breathe out. \"Where could she have gone, Cornelius? Is there a place she showed interest in?\" Breathe in. She hasn't been kidnapped. She's just wondered off. Breathe in. Wait. \"Thumbelina! We told her about your kidnapping!\" \"Yes, we did.\" Thumbelina replied, confused. \"What does that have to do-\" \"Remember how she said she wanted an adventure like yours?\" Thumbelina gasped. \"I thought we warned her about that!\" \"Apparently, not enough.\" Cornelius said, infinitely upset. He ground his teeth. \"She is so grounded when I find her, mark my words.\" \"Don't be too harsh on her, cher . She's only ten. She doesn't know better.\" Cornelius scowled at her. \"You baby her too much. She does,\" he stressed the last word, \"know better, because I taught her to know better. At least, I thought I did.\" He pulled at Buzzby's antennae. \"Come on, I have an idea of where to look.\" A few minutes later would show that Cornelius knew his daughter well. His intuition was correct in that Liliane would surely be at the pond that started Thumbelina's troubles oh so many years ago. Although, she wasn't exactly at the pond, which probably accounted for her missing status as she wandered around overgrown shrubbery almost a meter away. She wasn't alone either. She had with her her best friend, Christopher, and another friend of his, what-ever-his-name-was. Cornelius didn't care. His eyes were zeroed in on his daughter, who now had a look of fright at seeing her father and mother bearing down on her. \"Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in, missy?\" Cornelius asked, jumping off of Buzzby and choosing to fly the remainder of the distance to the ground. \"Uh…\" Liliane was fortunate enough to have her answer delayed by her mother's sudden hug, not that she had an answer prepared anyway. Thumbelina pulled back to gaze worriedly into her daughter's eyes. \"We were worried sick about you!\" \" Were being the key word. Now, I'm upset. Do you have any idea what could have happened to you?\" Cornelius pipped up. Liliane feebly protested with, \"I just wanted to-\" She got cut off. \"And you!\" Cornelius turned an accusing finger on Christopher, who jumped at suddenly being addressed. \"I trusted you to keep my daughter safe. What do you have to say for yourself?\" Christopher looked down in guilt, having nothing to say as it seemed to be a good idea at the time. Cornelius turned to the third party. \"I don't even know you!\" \"Ames, your highness.\" He responded, the only one brave enough to answer an irate King. Cornelius deflated slightly at getting an answer. \"Ames. All right then.\" He grew irate again as he turned to his daughter. \"On Buzzby. Now. And you two with Thumbelina. We're discussing this at home.\" He turned back to Buzzby and grumbled under his breath, \"I can't believe this.\" Minutes later, all three members of the royal family sat across from each other in the princess' chambers, having sent away the two boys to reunite with their families and receive their own punishments. They spent a tense couple seconds just staring at each other, with Thumbelina attempting to calm her husband down with gentle pats and reassure her daughter with caresses simultaneously. Cornelius took a deep breath in. \"What were you hoping to accomplish, Liliane?\" \"Uhhh… Adventure?\" Liliane answered sheepishly. Cornelius stared at her silently. \"It's not like I went alone!\" Liliane continued defensibly. Cornelius' eyes narrowed. \"Come on, I just wanted to have fun like Maman .\" \"Fun?\" Cornelius responded indignant. He tensed to stand up but stopped at a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Thumbelina sharply. Thumbelina ignored his stare. \" Petite amie , I don't know exactly what part of the story you find so interesting but I wasn't having any fun. I was scared. I wanted to be home. I wanted to be with Grand-m è re or your Papa . We told you this story so you'd be careful— \" \"And not run off.\" Cornelius interjected. Thumbelina sent him a look. \"—and stay within the Vale where your Papa and I could reach you quickly if anything like that were ever to happen to you. We didn't tell you— \" \"—Just so you could go looking for it!\" Cornelius shouted, unable to keep back from saying anything. Liliane got a look of exasperation that thoroughly resembled Cornelius' own. \"And you were definitely not supposed to take your friends along on this quest of yours! Do you have any idea how worried we were? You have no idea what kind of thoughts raced through my mind. I thought I wouldn't be able to find you for months! That'd you'd been kidnapped, held hostage, sold off, forced into whatever!\" \"It's not like I went defenseless! I took my sword!\" \"I gave that to you for cases of emergency! Not to go searching for willy-nilly dangerous 'adventure'.\" Liliane led out a grunt of anger. \"You used to be so much cooler! You never take me anywhere anymore.\" She stalked off. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Cornelius ground out. \"Away!\" Liliane responded, then slammed the wooden bark door that led to her private chamber pot and bathing area. Cornelius stalked to the door. \"Grounded! Until the next new moon!\" He shouted through the bark. \" Tout ce que !\" came a muffled response. Thumbelina sighed behind him. ~0~ Breathe in. Square shoulders. Sigh heavily. Breathe out. Open door. Breathe in. Approach. Sit down. Breathe out. \"You hurt your mother, you know.\" Cornelius commented, crossing his arms as he stared down at his daughter, not caring that she lay petulantly across her bed after hearing the news. He had thought his daughter would be ecstatic at the news. After all, she had been asking for one since she was little and witnessed her friends having some, but it seemed she had grown out of that phase long ago, if her little cry of dismay and judgmental words earlier were anything to go by. Cornelius guessed he could see why. He himself had wanted a sibling when he was very young, when everyone in the immediate vicinity was years older than he, at least until he realized that any addition to the family meant divided attention from his parents. \"We won't love you any less, Liliane.\" Cornelius expressed, thinking that that was the source of the problem. \"That's not it!\" Liliane shouted out, turning her head to give her father a brief glare before tucking her head back into her crossed arms. Cornelius was confused. \"Than what is it?\" \"It—Nothing. Never mind.\" \"Liliane…\" Cornelius groaned out. \"Look, I'm not good at this whole 'girl talk', but your mother is currently crying in our room much like you are here and I'd really like to know why. We thought you'd like having a sibling to play with.\" Liliane huffed. \"I'm not a little girl anymore, Papa . I don't want to play.\" \"Oh, so that wasn't you and your friends I found having a water fight in the nearby pond the other day?\" Cornelius teased. \" Papa !\" Liliane moaned, embarrassed. \"It's not the same! We didn't have any little kid around demanding our attention.\" \"Oh.\" Cornelius said wonderingly. \"So, you just don't want to be stuck with an annoying brat that'd embarrass you in front of your friends?\" \"No!\" Liliane huffed, annoyed that her father didn't get it. \"Than what is it ?\" Cornelius was getting annoyed now. He crossed his arms to show his displeasure. \"You wouldn't understand.\" Liliane grumbled. \"Because I'm an only child?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then make me understand. What's the problem?\" \"You're a boy.\" Liliane stated. \"I would sure hope so.\" Cornelius replied, smirking when Liliane's lips pulled further down. \"Be serious, Papa ! You're a boy. You were an only child. You were the Prince héritier !\" \"What's your point?\" \"What if the baby is a boy too?\" Liliane shouted in despair. Cornelius was slowly starting to see the problem, but not wanting to come to the wrong conclusion, asked \"What's so wrong with having a brother?\" \"Everyone will like him more than me.\" Liliane said tearfully. \"People only like me because I'm the only royal child for now.\" \"And you think the Vale will be more inclined to a male heir.\" Cornelius stated. Liliane nodded her head meekly. Cornelius sighed. \"I'm sorry, Liliane. I wish I could say the Court wouldn't prefer a male heir.\" Cornelius admitted, sitting down next to his daughter to wrap an arm around her. She leaned into the embrace. \"But I know for sure that that doesn't mean everyone will suddenly dislike you now.\" \"Yes, they will.\" \"No, they won't. See, just because you're a royal child doesn't mean the people are obligated to love you.\" \"They have to be nice.\" \"They respect you because you respect them . You haven't been treating them horribly, have you?\" \"Of course not!\" \"Then why wouldn't they like you? See, the people wouldn't turn on someone they find nice and honorable. And what of Christopher? Did you think he'd stop wanting to be your friend? It's not like he'd want to be friends with a baby.\" Liliane tilted her head down. \"What if he became my friend because I'm the princess?\" Cornelius frowned. \"Hey now, you can't think that way. You'll end up alone if you think everyone had ulterior motives for talking to you.\" Liliane sniffed. \"He better not have.\" \"I'll throw him into the dungeons if he does.\" Cornelius said confidently. Liliane tugged hard at her father's hand in displeasure. \"Ok, I won't but I'd definitely have a few words with him.\" Cornelius rubbed his hand up and down her arm. \"And we don't even know if the baby is a boy yet. You might be getting worked up for nothing.\" \"You don't know that it's not a boy.\" \"Look, petite amie . I know it sounds like the best thing in the world, being a Queen, having power, all this money, being like your Maman is now, but it can be the most boring and annoying job in the world.\" Liliane snorted. \"Oh please. You get to throw parties whenever you want. Everyone does everything you say. You can do whatever you want.\" \"Ha! That's what you think! Don't you remember how I met your mother? You think I'd run away from my responsibilities if all I did was party, dance, and frolic around? You're greatly mistaken.\" \"I don't see how public counsels with the people to hear their problems or having dinners with foreign visitors or having to listen to reports on the economy is so bad.\" \"Oh yeah? How about having to do mountains upon mountains of paper work every day before I'm allowed to eat dinner with my family? How about having to watch what I say and act lest I accidently offend those foreign visitors? Or having to watch what strategies I use to come up with the best yield and profit possibly for our economy, monitoring the lords that watch over more distant villages for potential corruption, honoring all treaties and making up with contingency plans in case we ever must engage in a war? Or how about how I still have to attend lessons to stay to date on languages, history, and inventions? I must keep physically in shape as well and who do you think has to direct those parties you so love to attend? Not only that, I must keep watching my back and my family's back in case a spy or traitor is amongst us. Being the Prince h è ritier and later Roi is a dangerous and stressful job and I sometimes wish I had had an older brother so I could have lived with your Maman on her mother's farm instead.\" \"…oh.\" Liliane wiggled a little, not having thought about it that way. Behind her, Cornelius secretly smiled at having gotten through to her. He put back on an impassive face when Liliane pulled away and turned to look at him. \"I want to name it.\" \"We'll see.\" ~0~ Breathe in. Fix glare. Raise eyebrow. Breathe out. Cross arms. Breathe in. Glance him over. Make him squirm. Breathe out. Stand up. Breathe in. Walk forward. Stand stiffly. Breathe out. Question him. \"So, Christopher , what makes you think you're worthy of my daughter?\" \" Papa !\" Liliane cried indignantly. \"Don't scare him away,\" hissed the fourteen-year-old quietly. \"I really like him.\" Cornelius wasn't at all discreet with his reply. \"If he is man enough, and loves you enough, I won't be able to scare him away,\" he directed to his daughter, before turning and addressing the young man once more, \"So again, why should I allow you to court my daughter?\" \"Well, sire, sir,\" Christopher wriggled his hands together, barely able to look into the eyes of his ruler so instead bowed his head, and replied with what he hoped was enough to appeal to the fair and just King's heart, \"I know that I don't have the riches, or title, or extensive schooling that should rightfully be your princess' due, but I love your daughter dearly, sir, and I will make utterly sure to strive to give her life's comfort and make her happy, if you allow it, sir.\" He bowed deeply. Cornelius raised an eyebrow and asked sharply, \"If I allow it?\" Christopher gulped. \"Yes…?\" \"So, if I forbid this courtship, you'd leave her alone?\" \" Papa !\" \"Cornelius…\" sighed the Fairy Queen from her place at the thrown. \"Well?\" Christopher hesitated, glanced at Liliane and stood slowly, wondering if what he said next would make him an enemy of the King. \"With all due respect, sir…\" \"Is that a no?\" \"Yes.\" \"It's a yes?\" \"Ye-No. My answer is no.\" Christopher tried not to squirm. Christopher tried not to squirm as the Fairy King got closer, and he had to look up to look straight into his eyes. \"No? You'd disrespect your King?\" \"That,\" Christopher began before pausing, glancing quickly over at Liliane again, who stood off to the side frowning occasionally at her father and smiling encouragingly at her beau, and changed course, \"I wish to court your daughter, sire. I love Liliane. And frankly, sir, it would make your daughter happy if we had your blessing to court and get married, but if we don't, no, I will not stop loving her or visiting her.\" He stood as straight as he could as he waited to hear his fate. Cornelius hummed, and stared right at the young man with a stern face, giving nothing away of his dismay at the fact that his daughter was growing up. He had not been expecting this day so soon. Though, truthfully, he should have as his daughter was at the age his wife had been when he first met her, and this Christopher character was at the age he had been at the time too. Still, he hadn't been anticipating waking up that morning to his daughter announcing she had plans to court her childhood friend. If he had known their friendship would lead to a more romantic relationship he might have tried to separate them more, kept his daughter away, in hopes of delaying the inevitable. Still, if his daughter just had to choose a suitor, at least she had chosen someone Cornelius had witnessed grow up, and thus, someone who had been under his watchful eyes. He preferred it being the boy he had to frequently send home once it got too dark to play in the past than some random boy he had never heard of or seen before. \"Do you know where your beloved Queen came from?\" Cornelius asked, confusing his audience at the seemingly random question. \"The human village?\" \"A farm.\" Cornelius corrected. \"I found my dear wife as she was dancing on her windowsill of her mother's house at a farm.\" He walked back to said wife, and held her hand as he sat back down. Liliane stood next to her beau as they both faced the King. \"I didn't pay attention to where she was at the time, what she was wearing, where she grew up, or what her station in life was. All I saw was a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice and an even more beautiful personality to boot. I fell in love with her instantly. She didn't need to have 'riches', a 'title', or 'extensive schooling'. I just needed her.\" Thumbelina, although having heard praises and sweet nothings for more than a decade now, blushed hearing his appraisal. Liliane leaned on her chosen, and whispered, \" Papa ?\" Christopher gazed on, with growing hope. \" Mon roi ?\" \"If I ever find out you hurt her in anyway, I'll come after you with my sword. Understood?\" Cornelius said sternly. \"You'll never have to.\" Christopher assured him, shaking his head along with his words. Liliane grabbed his hand, biting her lip to futilely stop her smile from spreading. \"Good.\" Cornelius said sharply, before suddenly smiling. \"There is a ball coming up to celebrate a successful harvest this year, I expect you to escort my daughter in.\" \"Of course, sir.\" Christopher said, smiling now and bowing briefly. \"I'll take good care of her.\" Liliane giggled excitedly, jumping slightly from next to her chosen, before she launched herself into her father's arms. \"Thank you, Papa !\" She kissed his cheek. \" Je t'aime .\" She grinned and flew back to Christopher, grabbing his hand and pulling him along in the direction of the door. \"We're off to meet up with our friends, ok?\" Cornelius frowned. \"Uh, wait. Ch éri , it's time for-\" She was gone. \"Oh, never mind.\" He sat back and sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. Thumbelina giggled next to him. \"And what's so funny?\" \"You.\" Thumbelina answered, reaching over and grabbing his arm to run a soothing hand down to his hand. She placed her other hand on his cheek to turn his head in her direction. \"She reminds me of you when you were younger.\" Cornelius snorted. \"No, she is definitely just like you. That Christopher, though,\" He wagged a finger in the air and nodded to where he and Liliane were last seen, \"he is definitely like me.\" He puffed out his chest and smirked, \"I was far braver though.\" Thumbelina shook her head briefly at his cheekiness before answering. \"But just as in love with Liliane as you are with me.\" With sudden suspicion, Cornelius squinted and accused her with, \"You knew about this, didn't you?\" Thumbelina smiled at being caught. \"Maybe.\" Cornelius scoffed. \"Should've known.\" Thumbelina snickered. \"You know who you sound like, right?\" She tensed up in preparation. Sensing this, Cornelius cautiously asked, \"What do you mean?\" Thumbelina shifted, said, \"You sound just like your mother,\" and launched out of her chair toward the doorway as Cornelius gasped in horror at her words. \"You take that back, Thumbelina!\" He flew after her. \"Thumbelina!\" Her laughter echoed off the ways as her indignant husband reached out to grab her and missed. ~0~ A/N: I hope Cornelius didn't come off as being OOC. His personality here is based heavily on the scene where he is talking to his parents. I felt Cornelius would act a little sweeter around the girl he has a crush on, as we do in RL, and so I used that scene as a focal point on how he'd act once they grew comfortable together in married life, especially after adding children to the mix. Either way, I hope you as the reader enjoyed this fic.

Too many rules! The storybooks never said anything about there being so many rules! Don't slouch. Stand upright. No twittering. No moaning, whining, or tripping. Don't walk too fast. Shoulders back. Use this spoon. Don't clean the plate. Leave the work to the servants. Bow your head to anyone noble. Curtsy a little lower. Be in bed on time. Don't dawdle. Go to your lessons. Sit still. Acknowledge the people, but remain regal. Laugh daintily, not gregariously. Always be dressed. Be friendly but detached. Be fair and logical. Stay within sight of the guards. Stay present, stay pleasant, stay proud. She understood now why Cornelius was so eager to skip out and hide with the humans. Thumbelina tried really hard not to yawn as her designated professor continued on and on with sharing the history of the royal fairy family, how King Colbert was actually King Colbert the Third, how his great-grandfather united the fairy people and began a royal dynasty, how Queen Tabitha came from a long line of nobles where she was the first born female, how Cornelius had cousins scattered across France acting as lords and dukes who watch over more distant villages and report to the King and Queen. It was all fascinating but not when she had been plowed over with the information for the past three weeks, four times a week, three hours at a time. It was a blessing that Cornelius felt a little rest and relaxation was in order after he himself had been subjugated to more lessons on etiquette – after forsaking his kingdom during his search for Thumbelina, even if it was a noble cause – and sword lessons – because how could a prince have so much trouble warding off a ghastly toad with barely a weapon at hand? Sneaking away was easier than she thought, but she guessed having her angsty and rebellious fiancé – who was more than knowledgeable about their kingdom's defenses and knew about a hundred ways to get around it off the top of his head – had a lot to do with it. She only hoped their absence wouldn't be noticed for a while yet, but considering how worried and paranoid her future-mother-in-law could be, she guessed that was a fruitless hope. Still, she couldn't help but giggle as the wind carried them further from the Vale and closer to their destination, wherever that may be. Only Cornelius knew where they were going. Although, to be honest, she was pretty sure she had seen that particular group of trees and that rock before. Various times. \"Um, Cornelius?\" He didn't even turn around. \"Don't say it.\" \"So, we are lost?\" She asked softly. \"You said it.\" \"Do you have any idea where we are?\" \"Not a clue.\" \"Cornelius!\" Thumbelina grumbled, slightly annoyed. \"It was supposed to be on the left side of the fork in the forest.\" \"And what happened?\" Cornelius scowled. \"If I knew that would we be lost?\" He replied harshly. Silence. \"Sorry.\" He muttered. \"Do you know how to get back to the Vale from here?\" \"No.\" \"I see…\" Thumbelina looked around, although she knew she wouldn't find anything that would help her, being as she was even less knowledgeable about the forest than her fiancé. \"Cornelius, stop. We're only getting more lost in here.\" Cornelius tsk-ed but complied, aiming Buzzby toward an outcropping by a river. They alighted close to the edge and Thumbelina gratefully dropped out of Cornelius' arms after he picked her up off Buzzby. She stretched a little, relieving some of the soreness in her limbs after being in the same position so long. She silently moaned when a crick in her neck sounded. She watched for a few seconds at what Cornelius was doing before moving closer to the water. With his back turned to Thumbelina, Cornelius gazed up at the sky, paying close attention to the position of the sun without looking directly at it. He recalled that from the Vale he could see when the sun set over the horizon so if he could only figure out where the sun was heading then they could head in that direction too. Too bad for them, it was midday and the sun was high in the sky perfectly centered. Cornelius' eyebrow twitched in annoyance. He turned at hearing a splash behind him. It seemed Thumbelina had no problem with where they had landed. Looking in to the water, Thumbelina grinned at her reflection before smoothing down her wind tussled hair a little. A breeze passed by and she inhaled the scent of spring in the air. The ledge they were at was a hop above the water and considering that she could see the river's floor, she gauged that it wouldn't be a bad thing if she jumped in and refreshed herself. Cornelius had taken the time to teach her to float the past few weeks. She bit her lip and glanced at Cornelius. He was still turned away so she lifted her heavy dress off her shoulders and placed it on the ground. She had a thin camisole under her dress, and thankfully no corset – wings didn't allow for corsets much to her relief. Kicking off her shoes, she gleefully jumped feet first into the water. It was cold but getting completely submerged helped ward off the chill quickly enough. Extending her legs, she stood and looked up to see Cornelius looking at her with a raised eyebrow. He blushed and looked away at seeing what she had on, or didn't have on. The dress had gone unnoticed. \"Come down here, Cornelius! The water is amazing!\" \"I don't think that's the best idea…\" \"Why?\" Thumbelina giggled, then dropped a hand into the water and splashed him causing him to hold up a hand. \"Come on!\" \"Oh man.\" He muttered, but resolutely sighed and turned to take off his tunic and weapons. He laid them down next to Thumbelina's dress, stretched briefly, and took a running start toward the ledge. He smiled at both the thrill of falling and Thumbelina's joyous laugh as she swam further away. The water really was refreshing. \"I miss days like this.\" \"So do I.\" Cornelius agreed, swimming closer. He nudged at her playfully. \"I told you being royalty wasn't all it was cut out to be.\" \"There's a lot more work than I thought for sure.\" \"Still want to marry me?\" Cornelius smiled playfully. Thumbelina turned to him sharply and gave an uncharacteristic glare. \"Of course I do! How could you ask that?\" Cornelius' smile widened. \"Sorry, princess.\" \"Not a princess yet.\" \"Soon.\" Cornelius asserted. \"Very soon.\" He racked his eyes down when she turned away, and muttered to himself, \"Not soon enough.\" Thumbelina glanced back. \"I'm sorry?\" \"Oh nothing. I stubbed my toe.\" He passed off easily. \"Oh.\" She kneeled down further into the water with a sigh. \"What were you doing before?\" \"Something my father taught me. See, if you know where the sun rises and sets you can figure out where's east and west, north and south. Stars would've worked best but that's obviously impossible now. Not that the sun worked very well,\" he gestured to the sky, \"it's smack in the middle of the sky.\" He frowned up at it and immediately looked away when he got spots in his eyes. \"Ah, well. At least, we get to go swimming for a while.\" \"I guess.\" And swimming they did, or as much as Thumbelina could while staying close to shore. Cornelius had no problems swimming further out, periodically diving under the water and coming back up with goodies from the floor, like shells and colorful rocks he swiftly handed over to Thumbelina. One time he even dove a little further down when he saw a shiny golden glow behind a rock, discovering it to be a coin the humans use to purchase items. This little escapade ended with Thumbelina expressing worry over how long he had spent under the water and Cornelius coming up with a particularly foolish and diabolical idea. He deliberately swam a little further out before diving again, grabbing hold to a plant so his body wouldn't naturally float up, and looked to where Thumbelina's legs were standing in the water. It wasn't long after that he could hear Thumbelina's muffled voice calling out his name above the surface. He smiled and carefully swam closer, making sure Thumbelina couldn't see him yet. \"Cornelius? Cornelius! Where are you?\" He swam closer. \"Cornelius! This isn't funny!\" She turned around. Cornelius took the opportunity to swim up behind her. \"Please, Cornelius?\" He jumped. Thumbelina shrieked as she was suddenly scooped up into a pair of arms and was taken to the sky. She looked up into Cornelius' laughing face and shivered as he projected forward. Looking down to where they were going, Thumbelina yelled in protest as the land grew further away and the water got darker and darker signifying how deep it was. Cornelius paid her no mind as he hovered above the middle of the river for a moment and thrusted his arms up, effectively throwing Thumbelina out of his arms. Not being instinctively used to wings yet, Thumbelina plummeted to the waters below almost unable to close her mouth in time before it swallowed her whole. Cornelius laughed merrily looking down before diving in after her. Thumbelina fumbled around underwater, trying to see where the surface of the water was as she demanded her limbs to move the way Cornelius instructed her too, before the effort was rewarded with a warm body grabbing her from behind and dragging her to the surface. \"Cornelius!\" She protested, coughing up some water and taking in lungful's of air after the scare. \"Don't do that! I can't swim!\" \"You'll only learn how to swim with experience.\" Cornelius replied, chuckling. \"Not if I drown while trying.\" \"You won't drown if I'm holding you. Now,\" he scooted back and Thumbelina grabbed fast to his hands, \"like I taught you, leaned back, relax, and be like the wind: weightless.\" Thumbelina hesitated. \"Um…\" Cornelius turned her around. \"Come on, I have you.\" A brief kiss on her lips and Thumbelina began to slowly lean backwards, releasing a small bout of breath, and loosening her muscles. When she felt arms across her back and thighs, she further let go of her fear and closed her eyes against the sun, feeling the water get into her ears as she sunk slightly into the water. She looked up into Cornelius' eyes and grinned. \"Ok. I'm going to let go now. No! No. Relax… Good, just stay like that and… See? You're floating!\" Thumbelina grinned but didn't move a muscle. Cornelius chuckled. \"You can still move, you know?\" \"I think I'm okay the way I am, thank you.\" He shifted away. \"Then by all means.\" He almost chuckled at how Thumbelina didn't even glance at him when he swam toward her head, but did feel her tense when he grabbed at her hands. Feeling Cornelius' hands stretch to grab at hers, Thumbelina tensed and tried hard not to make any sudden movements as he pulled her arms further up so they stayed linked, forming a kind of diamond with their linked arms outstretched and legs straight out. She felt when his arms relaxed and let out a breath to match his languid demeanor. Soaking in the sun from above, the lovers stayed adrift for minutes more, becoming one with the river, letting the water massage tensions from their muscles and cool their mental states. With the winds tickling their exposed skin and the water muffling the sounds of the natural world it was only reasonable for the engaged couple to turn their reflections inward and let the times of the past come forth once more. For Thumbelina, memories of the past few weeks soaked her mind with unforgiving ruthlessness. When she had first heard of the possible existence of fairies from her Mother, she welcomed the news that on the off chance there could be people her size in the world, people that could take her in their arms and talk to her like a normal person. She even briefly wondered herself if she were one of those fairy creatures, if only it weren't for the significant lack of wings upon her back. Not that it wasn't wonderful having her Mother be her mother, and spending those early days on the farm were delightful enough, but having everything around her, everything humans of her mother's sizes would find miniscule and hardly heavy at all, dwarf her and drag her down brought down her spirits. Even those twigs that barely caused a batting of an eye to the farm animals proved to be bigger than her small frame. Who could help it but feel alone in the world, the great big world where she was barely a speck of dust to the creatures inhabiting it? When Cornelius descended upon her windowsill, it was like he brought the sun with him, in more ways than one. He filled a part of her soul that felt empty, he taught her that there was hope in the world, he taught her that she wasn't alone, that she could be loved. And she loved him in return. He was bright, and warm, and wonderful. He was everything she ever wished for and he gave her a place in the world. But her new place in the world brought many hardships and new, not all completely pleasing, experiences. For one, she was entering the world as a nobody. No one knew her. No one had heard of her. She just appeared in their little vale, on the arm of their beloved prince, the cause of his near death, with little idea of how the fairy world worked. She wasn't particularly liked by the more noble ladies – though she could guess why, she was naïve but not stupid – and the males certainly didn't look at her with respect. They tolerated her and spoke to her only when necessary lest they disrespect the royal family in some way. It hurt that they could so easily dismiss her. It was only the continual ranting of her fiancé about the behavior of the Court and how much he couldn't stand being in the same room as them that stopped her from running to her chambers and crying. In his eyes, they were all stuffy and stuck too closely to tradition for his liking, not to mention how angered they become when the rules aren't followed. That the prince himself, her future husband, held little regard for them came as an odd comfort to her. If what he said was true, even a little bit, than it wasn't necessarily her that was disconcerting to them but rather what she represented: a deviance from the laws and traditions they knew and held dear. That didn't mean it still didn't hurt. At least the royal family, her future family, weren't so setback in their ways. Sure, it seemed like the Fairy Queen was rather concerned over the future princess being a barely educated once-human but she wasn't dismissing her as a worthless being. In fact, it seemed like the Queen was taking her under her wings in a way, as a daughter of her own. It was her that arranged to have Cornelius' past tutors come in and teach her all things history, economic, and political. It was her that arranged to have more clothes in her closet. And it was her that called her over to fill out papers so she could have a more hands-on experience, even if the time was mostly spent answering her questions about things she didn't quite understand yet. She was grateful for her efforts just as much as she was for Colbert's efforts. While to many it didn't seem as if the Fairy King was putting too much time getting to know his future daughter-in-law, she knew the opposite was true. He wasn't as outspoken and attention drawing as his Queen was, but behind doors, where no one was around to eavesdrop, he would often encourage and salute her efforts to understand her role as both fairy and princess. He was a man of few words but the words he did utter were full of wisdom and often left her reanimated. Cornelius' thoughts ran along the same, yet different, lines. Being the sole heir of the fairy royal family, he had more realistic views on how the Court system truly worked. So far, he had been able to shield Thumbelina from the worst of the degrading comments and snide remarks made behind doors where the speakers didn't think he'd be able to hear them. Comments such as Thumbelina's bastard status as a fairy, how undeserving she was of wings, and on her lack of education for a system she didn't even know existed. Not to mention how harsh they were in their beliefs that she had seduced him somehow even though anyone that ever spoke to her could tell how sweet and endearing she really was. Cornelius would often be left clenching his teeth and balling his fists whenever he overheard such comments and his father – who had recently taken to bringing Cornelius' over to many of his meetings and other activities in hopes of molding the wayward teenager into the model leader he was meant to be – would have to step in and chastise his Court members on their flippant and atrocious behavior. He could overhear their hurried apologies but Cornelius knew they were only ashamed at being caught; they had no love for Thumbelina. At least not all of his people were as close-minded and rude as those noble families, however. Often, he would escape the flower patch his family was housed in and oversee the activities of the less noble families before he left on an expedition, bringing with him Thumbelina half the time, and he couldn't be more pleased at how accepting some of the families were at Thumbelina's attitude. In their eyes, she was a welcome change to the royal family. She was eager to know how they did many of their trades, spoke to them as their equal, and seemed genially interested in their affairs and wellbeing. It wasn't that his parents were unfair in their judgement and execution of laws, but they often neglected getting down and personal with the people they led. To Thumbelina, who had never been able to do much at her mother's oversized house, everything that seemed so mundane to the fairies seemed to be an amazing and incredible discovery. He wasn't dumb though, he knew some of them were hesitant and dubious at having a non-royal, inexperienced girl as the next Queen but he was sure that once Thumbelina caught up with the studies they would be more relaxed at the thought. Of course, thinking about how the fairies reacted upon meeting Thumbelina brought forth thoughts about when he met Thumbelina for the first time. It hadn't been planned. In fact, he had no plan that night other than getting away from that ridiculous parade his parents forced him to partake in while they washed the Vale with fairy dust. He had managed to escape having to ride on that white butterfly – How manly! Not – only through years of experience. Coming across Thumbelina's window was a very, very, very , welcome surprise. He thought love was overrated and that happy couples always exaggerated how they felt about their significant other, but upon gazing into Thumbelina's eyes he knew he was wrong in his thoughts. She was a beacon of light in his lonely life. Sure, he had his parents with him, but being that everyone else in his life treaded carefully around him due to his social status, he never knew how amazing it would feel to have that special someone that would make him feel on top of the world. He was just drifting off into a dream of him and Thumbelina during married life when he felt Thumbelina shake his hand. \"Cornelius?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Can we visit Mother next time?\" Cornelius yawns. \"Sure. Whatever you want.\" He squeezed her hand back. \"Thank you.\" She answered with a squeeze of her own. A moment passed before, \"Cornelius?\" Cornelius opened his eyes. \"Yeah?\" he elongated the word a little. \"I can feel myself burning. Can we go back to the shore?\" \"As you wish, my princess.\" He answered mischievously, standing up in the water. He held on to Thumbelina as she did the same but was too short to reach the floor and pulled her along as they got back to where Buzzby slumbered. On the shore both parties wrung out their wet clothing and redressed in the garments they came in. Wanting to give Thumbelina a little privacy and preserve what little modesty they still had between them, Cornelius turned his back to her as she pulled her dress over her head. At doing this, though, his eyes landed on a fairly flat piece of bark no bigger than the size of a fully-grown human that would work perfectly for the sudden idea he had in mind. He flew over and stood on it, testing its freshness and sturdiness before moving to drag it to the waterfront. \"What are you doing, Cornelius?\" \"I…\" he grunted as the bark was dragged over a pebble, \"am going to make a boat.\" \"A boat?\" Thumbelina's eyebrows shut up in surprise. \"Why would you ever want to do that?\" \"Because it will be fun.\" He smirked at seeing her dubious expression. \"You'll see.\" And she did see, well, sort of, when Cornelius found a particularly long stick that wasn't too heavy and pushed the bark into the water, waiting a moment to see if it floated, and then pulled her – and the stick – onto the 'boat'. She sat on the backend of the bark and watched Cornelius' back on the frontend as he dropped one end of the stick into the water. When it reached the floor, he pushed against the floor to propel the bark forward, much like how a human would use a crutch when a leg failed them. Soon they were drifting down the creek and Thumbelina relaxed a little seeing how the experience was very different to her time on that lily pad. At some point in their journey, Cornelius felt a drop of water fall on his hand. He paid no attention to it until a few more fell on his arm. Figuring it was Thumbelina splashing him, he turned and looked at her. She was leaning over the makeshift boat and looking at her reflection in the water as she brushed her hair down. Cornelius turned back around thinking she'd stop now that he knew. Seconds later, though, another droplet fell on his face. \"Thumbelina, are you splashing me?\" \"What? No. Why?\" she responds immediately. Seeing that the river wasn't particularly rough, Cornelius looked up and cursed seeing a dark cloud hanging above their head. He had noticed the vicinity get darker but had assumed it was a random cloud blocking out the sun momentarily. He was very wrong. Buzzby came over as the rain picked up. Being the gentleman he was, Thumbelina was lifted up by Cornelius onto Buzzby first before he leapt on and the trio were on their way looking for shelter. The closest haven they could find was a nearby dense bush so they huddled there for protection. \"This is so not how I wanted the day to end.\" Cornelius bemoaned. Thumbelina hummed and leaned on his shoulder with a smile. \"It wasn't all terrible. Thank you for taking me out, Cornelius.\" Cornelius snorted. \"You do realize without the sun I have no way of getting us out of here.\" \"So? The sun will come out again, but we'll never get to repeat today ever. There was a phrase for something like this. What was it again?\" She put a finger to her lips. \"Oh, yeah. 'Carpe Diem'. Seize the day.\" ","Summary":" Adrift ~0~ Rules, rules, rules! Too many rules!

There was a young girl with strawberry blonde hair as she was sound asleep in a big enough cot for herself as she was getting rest for the big morning ahead of working on the farm. A fairy with long white blonde hair, a long dress and silver sandals was flying, not realizing how close to the farm she was as she was tired, through the sky aiming towards her home. The rooster was about to crow, then glanced at the fairy, wondering if he was seeing things or not. The fairy's eyes were half closed as she ended up flying close to the rooster. The rooster's eyes widened as he let out a small squawk in surprise. The fairy gasped, surprised from the squawk and flew hastily off in another direction. The rooster watched her go and looked confused. The girl woke up and rubbed her icy blue eyes and blinked a few times. \"Ouch!\" The fairy yelped as she hit the glass of a window. The rooster cringed to that. The girl crawled out of her bed and came to her window and opened it to see the fairy which made her gasp in surprise. The fairy didn't notice the human girl yet, and looked over her wing that had bent slightly when she hit the glass. \"Oh, no...\" she whispered. The girl looked down. \"H-Hello...?\" she gently called to the fairy. \"A-A-Are you okay?\" The fairy looked up and gasped. She went to fly, but due to her wing, almost fell off the window ledge. \"Oh, you hurt your wing...\" the human girl pouted, putting her hands to her face. \"I can try to fix that, I used to heal my dolls all the time.\" she then held out her hands to scoop up the fairy in, she wondered if this was a dream, but it felt too real, it felt like the stories that her parents used to tell her all the time. The fairy trembled in her hands, but let the girl scoop her up. \"Come here... Let Auntie Naomi take a look at you...\" the girl cooed as she carried the fairy in her hands, she may had been almost a teenager, but she did believe a little bit in magic, but she was mostly in the attitude that she had to see certain things in person in order to believe them. In a world where manners were often taught, and especially since she was a princess, the fairy felt she had to reply. \"M-My name is Artemis...\" she said quietly. \"Artemis...\" Naomi repeated the name as she knelt down to a drawer to take out a first aid kit. \"That's a nice name.\" \"Thank you.\" Artemis said quietly. She noticed a walnut on the top of a windowsill. Naomi then went to take out bandages and anything else to help Artemis's broken wing. \"Ricky didn't give ya any trouble, did he?\" she then asked about the rooster which was supposed to crow to wake her and her guardian up for the day. \"Um, who is Ricky?\" Artemis asked politely. \"That's the rooster out there,\" Naomi pointed out the window to the rooster in place. \"He wakes us up in the mornin'.\" \"Oh... No, he caused no trouble, but he accidentally scared me.\" she told her. \"I'm sorry...\" Naomi said as she catered to the fairy's wings. Artemis winced as her wings were quite sensitive but let the girl fix it. After all, this human seemed nice. \"Sorry, I'm trying to make this as painless as possible.\" Naomi cooed. Artemis nodded, not trusting herself to speak until it would be done. Soon, Naomi finished and put away the kit. \"Try flapping a little bit.\" Artemis nodded, standing up and tried to 'hover' in the air. She did a few millimeters, but plopped back down, wincing. \"Just as I suspected,\" Naomi said. \"You need to stay off those wings for a little while, I'd say about three days tops.\" \"B-But I have to g-go h-home... and help th-the moon rise!\" Artemis gasped. \"Help the moon rise...?\" Naomi tilted her head. Artemis nodded, then stood up and curtsied. \"I am Princess Artemis: Fairy of the Moon.\" she introduced herself properly. \"Whoa...\" Naomi did not see that coming. \"I believed in magic and fairies when I was really little.\" Artemis looked up at her, hoping she wouldn't say the words every fairy hoped never to hear as it was practically an execution. Naomi gently scooped Artemis in her hands again. \"Maybe I could try to take you home?\" \"Oh, humans can't find it... M-Maybe you could c-call my b-brother here?\" Artemis suggested quietly. \"What's your brother's name?\" Naomi replied. \"Prince Cornelius.\" Artemis replied, grabbing her bag of magic dust to enable her to call for him. \"Prince Cornelius...\" Naomi repeated. \"He sounds so handsome.\" \"Oh, my brother is.\" Artemis smiled. She grabbed a small handful of the fairy dust. Naomi then collected the fairy dust. \"Now what do I do?\" \"Sprinkle the dust on the windowsill as you call his name.\" Artemis smiled. \"Like this?\" Naomi asked as she sprinkled the dust as Artemis taught. \"Prince Cornelius...\" Artemis nodded. \"Now, all going well, he'll be here within the hour.\" she smiled. Naomi smiled back. Artemis yawned and stretched. She leaned against Naomi's thumb and closed her eyes. Naomi smiled to that. \"Poor fairy~...\" she cooed. \"Can I rest a little until Cornie comes?\" Artemis whispered. \"Sure...\" Naomi said, she then gently set Artemis down and went to an old dollhouse of hers from when she was little, she then picked up a small crib for her baby dolls and put it on the windowsill and let Artemis sleep in it. \"Here, this should be comfortable.\" \"Thank you, Naomi.\" Artemis smiled sweetly at the girl. \"You're welcome, Artemis.\" Naomi smiled back as she let the fairy settle into the toy bed which was big enough for the fairy. Artemis hugged Naomi's finger, but then nipped it too. It was one of the fairy's ways to show affection. If a fairy was feeling threatened or caught a full bite was their defense. Naomi giggled. \"That tickled.\" Artemis tinkled a laugh, before starting to settle down. Naomi smiled. \"Is there anything else you need? I'm about to get myself some water.\" \"No thank you.\" Artemis smiled. \"Naomi!\" The girl's aunt called. \"Yes, Auntie?!\" Naomi called back then. Artemis opened one eye slightly. \"Time for breakfast, then we have a few chores to do.\" her aunt replied, kindly. \"Yes, ma'am!\" Naomi called back, then looked to Artemis, apologetic about her shouting. \"Sorry about that, but I've gotta get to work.\" \"It's okay, Naomi, if I am gone when you get back, I'll be back to visit.\" she smiled. \"Take care, Artemis.\" Naomi smiled back. \"You too.\" she said quietly before falling asleep. Naomi smiled, she then went to get dressed and did her hair in low pigtails. She wore a faded blue jumper with boots and she went downstairs to meet her guardian. \"Mornin', Aunty.\" \"Good morning, dear.\" the pleasantly plump, slightly elderly woman smiled to her niece. Naomi smiled back and hugged her aunt. Hugging her niece back, she directed her to the breakfast table. Naomi then let go and sat across her aunt so they could eat their breakfast and get started on their chores for the day. Her aunt smiled. \"Who were you talking to earlier?\" She smiled. \"Huh?\" Naomi replied, then smiled nervously. \"Um... I was having a dream.\" \"You've never talked during a dream before.\" her Aunt said, confused. \"This... Almost felt real...\" Naomi said. \"I saw a fairy... Her name was Artemis and I fixed her broken wing...\" Her Aunt smiled. \"I see.\" she said, sounding as though she believed her. \"I didn't think you would believe me...\" Naomi said. \"I mean, I haven't dreamed about fairies since I was just a kid.\" she then said, she was almost twelve now, but she thought it seemed childish if she told her aunt she saw a real live fairy. \"Between you and me? I still believe in fairies.\" she told Naomi. \"Y-You do...?\" Naomi asked in surprise. Her aunt nodded. \"Yes, dear.\" she smiled. \"I thought you'd think I was being silly.\" Naomi smiled sheepishly. \"No.\" Her aunt said and reached over patting Naomi's hand. Naomi smiled softly then. \"It was weird, but I tried to take care of her... She said the prince is going to come for her.\" \"Oh, my.\" Her aunt smiled happily. \"I'd hate for her to go so soon, but I hope she gets back home okay.\" Naomi then said as she took a sip of her juice. \"Well, we could sort something out so she could come by whenever she wants.\" her aunt suggested. \"That would be nice.\" Naomi had to agree. \"Now, time for some chores.\" her aunt smiled, once they were done eating. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Naomi nodded back with a smile.

For what seemed like forever, the world had been a frozen wasteland. But today the ice was melting away. The girl knew that this would be the day that she could start to anticipate the end. Nothing lasts forever, and as much as she had enjoyed being safely hidden in the earth, soon she would be able to see the world. Soon she would be able to walk to places she had never dreamed of. Today would not be the day she blossomed, that would take even more time, but instead it would be the day she laid down her roots. Water, icy water, trickled down next to the casing of the girl. She shivered, and the casing softened enough for the growing roots to push their way out. Days passed, each with a new discovery, and soon a small bud had found its way to the sun. Though the weather was still brisk, inside the bud a girl felt the warmth of the sun for the first time ever. Though she could feel and understand she was still as asleep as ever. And one day, the bud opened. The sun shone brighter than it had ever before, and the waking girl had to shield her eyes. She looked around. The entire world was full of colours. The sky was blue, the clouds white. None of this would have been visible underground. Flowers bloomed in every colour, and all across the garden other people were waking up for the first time.

A/N: I watched this movie yesterday with my little cousin and was inspired to write this one-shot. As always, comments are highly appreciated :) There was once a beautiful young woman, who, more than anything in the world, wished for a child. She was barren, you see, and her husband was constantly away and travelling as often merchants do. The beautiful young woman, Eve, was lonely. She prayed for a child every night. One day, she was walking through town and saw and old beggar lady. Providing her with food, the crone pressed a seed into Eve's hand with a smile, telling her to care for the plant as if it were her own, to love it unconditionally. Eve did. Every morning, she would coo at the contents of the flowerpot, kissing its closed flower and stroking its green leaves before giving it water. She repeated this ritual for weeks, until one day, with the rise of the sun, her pressed kiss to a gorgeous purple bud caused the flower to open. A small figure lay its golden middle, tiny body naked and covered in pollen as she gasped, tears springing to her eyes. Amazed, Eve reached out a finger, elegant appendage stroking over a delicate body as the being lifted its head, blinking tiredly. She was beautiful. A light mess of hair tangled atop her head and she had sapphires for eyes, their brightness and colour ethereal. But perhaps most impressive were her wings. They were large compared to his small body, inky blue against dark purple flower petals and boasted the tiniest, softest feathers the young woman had ever seen. \"Oh, my miracle,\" Eve breathed with a watery smile. \"My angel: Thumbelina.\" And so Thumbelina was her name. *** Life was difficult when you were so small. While Thumbelina loved her mother dearly, and the world she had been brought into was nothing short of magnificent, the tiny being often felt awkward and out of place in its wide expanse. She couldn't get into any of the cupboards if she was hungry, nor could she properly use… well, anything really. Eve modified it all for her. It made Thumbelina feel incredibly guilty; that she'd done so much and yet never be able to truly hug her or kiss her cheek, or that caring for her when she was old and grey would be a near impossibility due to her size. She'd tried to fly once, twice, three times… But no matter much she stretched her wings, intent of taking off and flying toward the sun, Thumbelina would tumble to the ground. She didn't understand why they didn't work, only that they were useless at her back, and got ruffled very quickly. She hated them in their impracticality, especially because grooming was always difficult. She was much too small for her mother to help without hurting her. And so, the tiny being spent most of her days wandering around the garden or in the library; almost killing herself in her attempt to open heavy things. Eve had taught Thumbelina to read. \"Mother, would you tell me a story?\" But sometimes, it was nice to simply listen. \"What would you like to hear?\" \"Something different,\" the little being requested through a yawn. \"Engaging. Romance, perhaps?\" Eve clucked her tongue once, brows pulling together in thought before she snapped her fingers in triumph, reaching for a novel. \"Here we are: Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there lived a Faerie Prince…\" Thumbelina was enthralled. Were there really others like her? Other people the size of the average human thumb? It seemed wildly improbable at best. After all, if there were other flower children, what were the chances any of them were within a reasonable distance for attempting communication? \"They are little, just like me!\" Thumbelina gasped in surprise. \"These are faeries, Thumbelina. And faeries have wings so they can fly.\" \"Mother, have you ever seen a faerie?\" Eve smiled, though the thing soon turned sad on her face. \"Well, I thought I did once.\" \"Really?\" Thumbelina asked, astonished that her mother might have seen an actual faerie before. \"Yes.\" Her mother chuckled and then continued the story. \"And here, the faerie prince and princess are having a wedding.\" Her mother moved her spectacles closer to the book so that Thumbelina would have a better view. \"And, they live happily ever after,\" Thumbelina exclaimed excitedly. \"Oh, usually, dear.\" Thumbelina kept her eyes firmly trained on the page, eyes roving over pictures of tiny people in crowns and fancy dress, their large, gorgeous wings so different from hers. Where she had dark feathers, they had sparkling transparent matter, like a dragonfly but more colourful and beautiful. Even if they did exist, who was to say that they would not view her as an abomination? \"Hmm, I suppose it works best...if two people are about the same size.\" Thumbelina looked at down at the handsome prince in the picture and then up at her mother. \"Yes, of course.\" Her mother agreed with her, nodding her head and smiling a sad smile. \"Yes..\"She stood up and walked along the book's edge. \"Well, that's not fair. I must be the only little person in the whole world. I wish I were big.\" Thumbelina sat down on top of the book and pulled her knees against her chest in an effort to console herself. \"Oh, no. Thumbelina, no. Don't ever wish to be anything but what you are.\" Eve said softly, a tip of her finger moving to lift her chin. \"Do not despair. You are not alone in this world, I am sure of it.\" Thumbelina gave her mother's face a passing look and couldn't help but disagree. No, she thought, an inexplicable sadness tightening in her gut. I am the only one my size. But the light-haired being gave her quirk of a smile, closing her eyes as her mother placed a kiss to the top of her head. \"I love you,\" she murmured. \"With all my heart.\" \"I love you, too, Mother.\" \"Bedtime, my dear. It's been a long day.\" She held out her hand as Thumbelina climbed into it, carefully holding her in the palm of her hand. She then carried her beautiful daughter upstairs to bed. \"You must go to sleep now. Sleep tight.\" \"Mother?\" Thumbelina asked as her mother gently tucked her in. \"Mm-hm?\" \"Would you please leave the book open?\" Thumbelina asked politely. With a soft smile on her face, her mother replied, \"Of course, dear.\" \"I wanna look at the pictures while I go to sleep.\" Her mother set the book up nicely next to her small bed, giving her a great view of the pictures. \"There.\" \"Good night, Mother,\" Thumbelina said as she looked at her, silently thanking her. \"Good night, Thumbelina. Don't stay up too late, all right?\" Thumbelina watched as she left, stepping in front of the makeshift mirror by her window as she observed herself: light hair, blue eyes, ineffectual black wings, fairly rumpled white and blue dress, her feet perpetually bare… She looked tired, she thought, and certainly not like a faerie. She was nowhere close to their delicate beauty. Not that it mattered anyway; faeries were fictional. Which honestly, was okay. This way, Thumbelina didn't have to worry about socializing. She could spend her days in her wonderful cocoon of solitude, comfortable and safe. She was not enthusiastic about people to begin with, so not having them his size… it wasn't so much of a drawback as just curiously disappointing. For some reason, Thumbelina felt lonely. \"Hmm..I know there's someone, somewhere. Someone, who's sure to find me soon.\" Thumbelina began to softly hum a tune and dance around on top of the windowsill. \"After the rain goes, there are rainbows.\" She gave her skirt a twirl, hoping against hope that there really will be a rainbow after all that she's had to endure. \"I'll find my rainbow soon.\" Walking over to the book, she stood beside the picture of the faerie prince. Looking up at him, she longed to be with him. \"Soon, it won't be just pretend. Soon a happy ending. Love, can you hear me?\" Thumbelina turned her head and glanced at him, hoping that he was listening, somehow. \"If your near me, sing your song, sure and strong, and soon.\" She leaned in slowly and gently pressed her lips against the picture of the faerie prince and looking into the eyes of the young man, wondered to herself, \"I wonder if there really are such things as faeries.\" She sighed, longing for company. A young prince was riding through the vale when he heard the most magnificent voice. It seemed to be coming from someone inside the window of a small farm. He slowed his Bumble down to get a closer look. \"Woah…Oh! Hello! What a beautiful voice. I wonder who she is. Stay here, boy. I'll check this out.\" He then tried to sneak around the side of the window and into the bedroom. Not watching where he was headed, the young prince hit his head against the window and fell onto the sill, out of sight. **Something hit her window. Immediately, Thumbelina hid behind the book at her bedside, tucking her wings tightly against her back as she held her breath, baby blues widening when she heard something push its way through the opened crack of her window. Taking a deep breath, the tiny being forced herself to take a peek over the spine of the book, gritting her teeth when she saw nothing. Her heart was pounding wildly in her chest, and she briefly thought to call for her mother, but then remembered that there was no way she'd be able to hear her. So, Thumbelina did what any logical person would do in that situation: she crawled over to the pincushion at the corner of the desk, and pulled out a needle. Brandishing it like a sword, the blue-eyed being narrowed her eyes, stance confident and wings extended like in the stories despite the fact that her insides were trembling. That's when she heard the whistle. It was low and impressed, and Thumbelina jolted the needle towards the sound without a second thought, ears picking up an indignant 'Hey!' as she swiped at the air again and again, barely seeing in her haste to protect herself. \"Jesus!\" Thumbelina stopped. \"Thank you. Christ.\" Hovering before her was a faerie. Beautiful with his sun-kissed, golden skin and copper hair, Thumbelina felt her arm drop limp, her eyes widening as she observed a straight nose and strong jaw, mouth perfect and pink against high cheekbones. His eyes were sparkling green gems in his face, their colour and playfulness unparalleled as they observed her in return, a delicate brow arching at the faerie landed with a soft 'thump'. Oh, his wings were gorgeous; shimmering gold and white and elegant against his back. His bare back, as the faerie wore no shirt. He was clad in pants that cut off just before his knees, the material a deep green embroidered with different swirling patterns of gold. Atop his head sat a delicate looking crown of the same yellow, its design one of flowers and leaves with tiny gems inlaced into the metal, one slightly pointed ear hidden from where it had fallen lopsided. His feet were bare, but his forearms were covered in odd bracelets, a single amulet hanging from his neck. And the best part? He was only an iota taller than Thumbelina herself. The needle clattered to the floor. \"W-wait a minute. What are you staring at?\" When she didn't say anything he asked, \"Well, say something, will you?\" \"You… You're…you're one of them.\" She said in astonishment as she pointed at the picture in the book. \"I beg your pardon?\" the faerie asked, incredulous. \"I thought I was the only one my size in the whole world.\" She said, trying to explain to him what she was feeling. When she looked at him, she could feel his eyes traveling down her body, stopping at her giant wings behind her. \"You've got-\" he made some sort of vague motion to his back, wings fluttering delicately to try and make his point. Thumbelina understood. Quickly, she tucked her own wings away again, stepping back in alarm when the faerie stepped forward in protest. \"No, don't-\" The faerie paused, their eyes locked. \"Woah,\" he breathed, awed smile turning into a smirk. He stepped forward again, hands up in a peaceful gesture as he approached Thumbelina, the ginger being tense and nervous and she eyed the faerie warily. It touched her. Pressing a palm to Thumbelina's cheek, the other being bit his lip, hand sliding to his chest before yet again falling to his side. \"What's your name, beautiful?\" Thumbelina blushed wildly. \"Thumbelina,\" she replied softly. \"Well, Thumbelina, you're kind of adorable.\" Thumbelina blushed harder. \"I'm Cornelius,\" the faerie offered with a charming grin. \"Cornelius,\" Thumbelina repeated, a smile forming on her lips. Giggling, she said \"Well, that's a funny name.\" Her cheeks turned a rosy red, \"Oh! I mean it's perfect. Uh, It's nice to meet you.\" \"Likewise.\" He replied, trying to hide his smile. \"You're a… faerie?\" \"Since I was born,\" Cornelius answered. \"But my wings are nowhere near as cool as yours.\" \"Oh,\" Thumeblina breathed stupidly. She was completely overwhelmed. It was one thing to have some misconstrued, far off hope that other tiny people existed… It was another to be standing face to face with one. One who, apparently, enjoyed making others blush. And blush, Thumbelina did. Her entire body was flushed and warm and just couldn't look away from Cornelius and his gorgeous eyes. All her life she'd spent her time scoffing at romance novels because she couldn't understand them; how was it possible to fall in love with someone at all, let alone in an evening? It didn't make sense. It wasn't a concept Thumbelina had been capable of grasping. She thought that she understood it a little bit better now. \"Can I, uh… touch them? Your wings, I mean.\" Cornelius asked bashfully, a light pink dusting his own cheeks. \"You can say 'no'. I don't want to make you uncomfortable or anything.\" Thumbelina pondered this. Nobody, other than herself and her mother, had ever touched the inky black masses at her back, and even then, Eve had only over run her finger across them in what she'd hoped had been a comforting gesture. \"Yes,\" Thumbelina said, albeit a little shaky. \"May I… touch yours?\" Cornelius nodded, his cheeks turning a darker red as Thumbelina observed him with sharp interest, extending a hand and a wing in unison. Her fingers brushed a smooth, hard surface as she stood with Cornelius, bodies close but not touching. It felt like a beetle shell. Infinitely more delicate and cool to the touch, Cornelius's wings felt smooth and sent tingles up Thumbelina's spine, her lip parting in surprise. \"Yeah,\" Cornelius said breathlessly. \"They, um, they've got— fuck.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Thumbelina's hand dropped to her side, her ears flaming with embarrassment as she looked down, stepping away. \"The last thing I meant was to harm you,\" she babbled. \"I swear, I-\" \"Hey hey,\" Cornelius said softly, his own ears just as pink. \"It's okay, you didn't hurt me. It felt… It was good. I liked it.\" He approached Thumbelina slowly then, the other watching nervously as Cornelius wrapped an around her waist, tugging them flush. Thumbelina's eyes widened but she made no move to pull away, and Cornelius gave her every opportunity to. \"You can keep going, if you want,\" the faerie said warm and low, voice like butter against the shell of Thumbelina's ear. \"I'd like it if you did.\" Thumbelina exhaled shakily. \"O-Oh.\" Cornelius smirked, lips brushing the other's cheek as he pressed a ghost of a kiss to the smooth skin there. \"Yeah, Belina, oh.\" Thumbelina acknowledged the nickname with a flutter of her heart, hands moving to grip Cornelius's shoulders tightly. \"Can I..?\" the faerie asked. \"Yes.\" Thumbelina spread her wings, breath hitching as Cornelius ran his fingers over dark primary feathers, not daring to do anything else but lightly touch. Until he felt the feathers at the base of Belina's right wing. He only barely touched the out of place plume but Thumbelina hissed in pain all the same, blushing and looking away from Cornelius as she composed herself. The faerie frowned, hesitantly reaching back to dig his fingers into the soft black mass, straightening and stroking and watching feathers float to the floor. Thumbelina sighed in relief, unable to stop herself from burying her face in Cornelius's neck, arms draped haphazardly about his shoulders. \"Thank you,\" she breathed. \"Don't mention it,\" the faerie replied kindly. \"I can do the other one, too, if you wanna sit somewhere.\" And that's how Cornelius spent the evening grooming Thumbelina's wings. \"So, nobody to do this for you?\" Cornelius had asked casually at one point, fingers sifting through primary feathers. Belina had shaken her head. \"My mother is a normal-sized human,\" she'd explained. \"It's just the two of us here.\" \"So, like, no boyfriend…\" Dean leaned forwards, breath ghosting the back of Thumbelina's neck. He scooted forward, groin practically flush against Thumbelina's back. \"Or any type of friend?\" \"N-No,\" the light-haired being breathed. \"I've never- I never knew there were others my size.\" Cornelius could see Thumbelina's blush paint the nape of his neck. He grinned, nudging the area with his nose as he smiled playfully, humming in thought. \"Well, now you know.\" \"Do you?\" Thumbelina asked quickly, the words tumbling rushed from her mouth. \"Do I what?\" \"Have a girlfriend?\" Belina had tacked on the last question like a quick afterthought, her heart pounding and face flushing and body overall out of her control. They were odd, these feelings, but definitely not unpleasant. Thumbelina only hoped she didn't sound like too much of an uneducated idiot… Which was odd in and of itself, as she'd never cared for the opinions of others before. \"Nah, I'm flyin' solo,\" Dean said easily, untangling another mess of feathers. \"But… I don't have to be.\" \"I see.\" \"With that tone,\" the faerie teased, \"I'm not sure you do.\" That was the end of that conversation. But it was by no means the end of the evening. They talked about everything; stars, books, the Universe; absent fathers and love for their mothers. Cornelius said Tabitha had been beautiful and wonderful and kind, and Thumbelina had absolutely no doubt in her mind that she had been. Mostly because Cornelius was beautiful and wonderful and kind. She'd told this to the faerie, who had looked on in absolute amazement, like he couldn't believe somebody was uttering those words when he didn't believe them himself. Because Cornelius didn't. There were people who told them how handsome he was on a daily basis; those who tried to court him or gain his favour… But Thumbelina had no idea who he was, and the tone of her voice was so earnest that Cornelius almost broke from the truth of it. \"Thanks, Belina,\" he'd replied lamely. \"You're pretty awesome yourself.\" Apparently, Cornelius hated the smell of roses, but adored dandelions, and he had a younger brother named Sam with whom his sun rose and set. He was a prince. Cornelius's father was named John, and once Tabitha passed on, he was never the same. Cornelius told stories of gruesome hunts and even grislier victories, of how John wanted his sons to be survivors. Sam and John often didn't see eye to eye, and Cornelius explained that he'd crashed into Belina's window while on a ride to simply get away from their arguing. He'd met some unfriendly visitors on his way, however, and his bumble, Buzzby, had thrown him at the last minute, buzzing off somewhere nearby to keep him safe. Dean had no doubt she'd soon return. Then wings came up. Embarrassed, Thumbelina had admitted that hers were ineffectual; useless things on her back only good for mild gliding. She had been prepared for Cornelius to shun her in disgust then, but the faerie had only set to grooming with newfound fervor and delicateness, praising the dark masses at Thumbelina's back with a reverence the blue-eyed being could barely understand. \"Do you want to?\" \"Sorry?\" \"Do you want to fly?\" \"Well, I- yes, of course, but-\" \"Come with me.\" Cornelius held on tightly, arms encircling Thumbelina's waist as her face buried into the crook of his neck and Buzzby went faster and faster, wind whipping against Belina's face as the light-haired being vibrated with excitement, laughing high and happy and full. Cornelius decided he wanted Belina to laugh all the time. Thumbelina discovered she loved flying. She slipped from Buzzby's back, black wings tucked into her back as she stroked the bumblebee with a soft smile, her vibrating ticklish against her palms. \"Thank you, Cornelius,\" Thumbelina said softly, sincerely. \"How can I ever repay you?\" \"Kiss me.\" And it was out without Cornelius's permission, but the words hung in the air like some sort of deflating balloon. The faerie pasted on an easy grin. He'd wanted to kiss Thumbelina since the young woman had looked at him, blue eyes wide and lips parted in awe, but not because Belina felt she had to. \"Sorry, that was… that was a mistake. You don't have to-\" \"Was it?\" Thumbelina asked, tone nothing but curious as she relaxed from her previously tensed position. \"A mistake?\" The way Belina was looking at him made Cornelius's heart knock against his ribs fast as a hummingbird. \"No,\" the faerie said slowly. \"No, it wasn't.\" Belina nodded, stepping up to the fae as she licked her lips nervously, leaning forward with an almost business-like attitude as she pressed their mouths together. Thumbelina melted into him, their bodies joining together. Gently, he pulled Thumbelina flush against his chest, one hand moving to tangle in light red hair while the other played against the other's back. Cornelius sighed. Slowly, Belina began to unwind. He was by no means completely pliant, but the blue-eyed being released some of the tension from her shoulders, wings wrapping around them both as they moved seemingly of their own accord, one hand holding tightly to Cornelius's forearms while her other arm encircled the faerie's shoulders, pressing them more tightly together. \"Mmmph.\" Cornelius grinned, tongue pushing out to lick at Thumbelina's bottom lip as the other being jumped in surprise, pulling away flushed and flustered as she swallowed thickly, looking from Cornelius's eyes to his mouth rapidly. \"Was that… adequate?\" \"Adeq- Belina, that- yeah. Yeah, that was more than adequate.\" \"Oh,\" Thumbelina said. \"Good.\" \"Yeah.\" They stared at each other for a long time. \"Do you think,\" Belina started nervously. \"I mean, would you be opposed to possibly… Perhaps we could-\" Cornelius pecked her mouth sweetly, pulling back with a playful grin. \"I think so.\" Thumbelina didn't know how much time they spent kissing, but it was long enough for her legs to grow tired and her mouth to feel swollen and numb, her body revving for more and more and more and more. She pulled away when she felt a sharp bout of pleasure hit her where Cornelius's hand had brushed her abdomen, sparks shooting up her spine to tingle at the back of her head and at her cheekbones. \"C-Cornelius…\" It felt so different than touching herself. Not that Cornelius was actually touching bare skin, but for some reason, the knowledge that it was somebody else, that it was Cornelius, made everything different. It was terrifying. Abruptly, Belina pulled away, reaching out for the faerie before she realized what she was doing and pushed the hand down. \"Cornelius, I can't- I'm sorry-\" Because it felt so good and she wanted it so bad but it was too much. She wasn't- it was too much. Maybe after some practice, maybe when she'd gotten used to the shortness of breath and the blood rushing in ears they could- but not now. Not when it was all so new. Thumbelina turned her back, wings encircling her body as she waited, with baited breath, to hear Cornelius leave. Cornelius did no such thing. \"Hey,\" the fae said softly, hand touching her lower back lightly. \"Belina, you've got nothing to be sorry for.\" He paused when the wings didn't open, palms pressing entirely against his companion's thin dress. \"Thumbelina, the last thing I want is for you to be uncomfortable. I don't- All this other stuff, I don't really care about it.\" Belina turned around then, raising a brow as her wings once again tucked behind her back. \"You're lying.\" \"Fine. Maybe I like kissing you. Maybe I want to kiss you all day long; touch you, and taste you and…\" The faerie had managed to gather Thumbelina in his arms, breathing out the words as intimately as a lover would, his tone soft and secret. \"And maybe I want to love you, completely and fully and until you can't remember your name. Maybe… maybe I do love you. But Belina, if any of that makes you uncomfortable, then I'll stop. I promise, I'll stop.\" Thumbelina was overwhelmed. Her hands gripped Cornelius's shoulders again as she swallowed thickly. \"You can't just stop loving someone, Cornelius.\" \"Says who? I'll be the first one to do it.\" Belina exhaled shakily, pressing a hesitant chaste kiss to the corner of Dean's mouth. \"I don't want you to do it.\" \"You don't… You want me to love you?\" Thumbelina bit her lip. \"I can't- I'm not comfortable with… everything, as of yet, but I can-\" \"No, Belina, everything at your pace. Everything-\" Cornelius let loose a happy breath, smiling brilliantly as he kissed Thumbelina hard and deep, feeling the same smile against his mouth as they pressed and pushed against each other, Belina taking the lead. \"Come.\" The blue-eyed being, tugged Cornelius toward the windowsill, grabbing the blankets and pillows from her small bed as they walked over. Unceremoniously dropping everything to the ground, Thumbelina sat back, tugging Cornelius down with her as they cuddled and whispered and watched the sky, sneaking little kisses and big ones and all the kinds in between in there place almost under the stars. The sun was beginning to rise when Cornelius turned to Belina, brushing his fingers along beautiful inky feathers. \"Let me be your wings,\" he whispered. Thumbelina felt her heart skip a beat as she leaned forward, looking into the mesmerizing green of Cornelius's eyes. This was not just a confession of love, this was an invitation. This was Cornelius asking for her company, always and forever, outside this room and this hour and this garden. Pressing their mouths together in a tender kiss, Thumbelina pulled away only to nudge Cornelius's nose with her own, smiling contentedly. \"Whatever makes you mine.\" ","Summary":" Thumbelina!AU based off of a prompt where Thumbelina has wings.

I do own the poem Thumbelina sang in this chapter. Author note: As much as I like Cornelius and enjoy the Thumbelina/Cornelius pairing it always bothered me how fast they fell in love and thought Thumbelina would be a better match with someone else. Plus, I love Gilbert Gottfried. Chapter 1: The beginning It had been one month since Thumbelina came to be at her mother's farm. Although she was born with the body of a sixteen year old, her personality and behavior was very reminiscent of a newborn fawn. She was still getting used to the new big world when all she had known before were red enclosed walls made of a soft material. When she was inside the flower she wondered at the world beyond the petals of her birthplace and at the huge lifelike shadows darkening the areas not covered by a strange bright warmth. She discovered newfound hope in the warmth which was prevalent for a good part of the day through the gossamer petals. Before falling asleep with the sweet scent of her rose bed filling her nose she caught the sound of voices of various timbres in her ears. She passed the time by imagining up stories of what the outside world would be like. Would she be surrounded by other little people who also lived in flowers or would those talkative moving shadows reveal themselves to be giants so big they could crush her flat? Did little beings other than herself even exist? All she knew was that the flower was gentle on her skin like a mother's hug and she hoped the beings outside would be as loving. When the day of her introduction to the world came she marveled as the strange warmth revealed itself to her by way of the petals slowly opening upon around her. She was shocked at the sight of the new world and all of its huge living things and objects. She felt fear mixed with excitement at the thought that perhaps the lady she came to call mother was as kindhearted as she initially presumed. She was also startled that the farm animals had the ability to talk as well as sing. Her mother called herself April and was quick to welcome her, with April halving a nut, hollowing it out, and placing bits of cloth soaked in lavender to make a bed for the young lass. She also used her sewing and mending skills to make dresses for her new daughter, with the ones of lighter colors being Thumbelina's favorites; as well as giving her some of her old doll clothes from when she was a little girl. In her time since her birth April also showed Thumbelina step by step how to mend, sew, knit, sing, dance, wash and dry clothes, clean, cook, garden, write, and read (most of which were fairytales) She marveled at the images in the books, getting wide-eyed when seeing the pictures of little beings her size: bugs, beetles, spiders, toads bird and fairies. She felt as if a huge weight had been lift off her shoulders upon discovering the existence of fellow little people. April also made it a priority to read the words of the fairytales to Thumbelina to improve her literacy. She liked these stories. But though reality was all well and good it was still nice to mentally use the stories to spark her imagination and take her on wonderful daydreams, especially when her mother taught her lessons in etiquette. She managed to curtsy without falling over but April was insistent that she perfect it and also that she'd wear a corset which she obtained from her childhood dolls. One day when Thumbelina was reading with her mother she had a thought. She worried how her mother would perceive it considering how out of the blue it was but she gave it a go. She asked her how she came to be in the flower and April answered that she didn't understand it either but that her dreams were answered the day she went to visit a good old witch who gave her a barleycorn to plant. \"And I was created from that barleycorn, Mother?\" Thumbelina asked. \"That's right Thumbelina.\" April answered. \"If only the good witch could've made me big. I would get into a lot less trouble then.\" \"I suppose but I wouldn't ask for you to be anything but what you are, Thumbelina. It's a part of you.\" April said calmly. \"Mother, do you think I can meet this good witch one day? I would love to ask her some things.\" Thumbelina said. \"Perhaps you will, child. Perhaps you will.\" In addition to flowers, Thumbelina took much enjoyment in the sun and feeling it on her skin. It enveloped her like a hug and she made a game out of putting her hand in the air in such a way that it looked like she was holding it. When speaking with April one day she sought her advice on the matter. \"Mother, is the sun really so small to be able to fit in my hand?\" Thumbelina asked. April gave her a curious look. \"Oh my dear, I can do so as well. The sun is actually quite massive.\" Thumbelina looked flabbergasted. \"Then that means its bigger than the whole world?\" \"Bigger than a majority of the planets around it too.\" April agreed. \"These are called Mercury and Venus before us followed by Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. On earth here we wouldn't last long without it.\" Thumbelina wondered at this. \"So mother, does that mean we could either end up dying from the cold if the sun ever went out or be crushed by it due to its size or…\" April stopped her. \"Heavens my dear, the things you come up with in that pretty little head of yours.\" She shook her head with a smile on her face. She then picked up Thumbelina with her hand and gently touched her to her own face in the form of a hug. \"My darling, you are near and dear to my heart. You needn't worry about the sun. It will be here long after were gone for future generations to enjoy as well. In fact should you ever lose your way you should look to the sun and know that I shall be looking at the same sun as well. We all share a place in this world after all. And that goes for the moon as well since it shines at night with the light from the sun and the stars would also guide you.\" Thumbelina hugged her mother back, tiny tears pinpricking her eyes. \"Thank you Mother.\" The animals, contrary to her first impression, were very friendly and warm to her barring moments where they would unintentionally breath so hard that it would send her toppling over once into the animals drinking water. As Thumbelina grew into her singing abilities she discovered one day that her singing was so beautiful and clear it could not only charm people but also animals as well. Of course, what else could one expect from a world where animals had the ability to speak? Since discovering this she would spend afternoons calling the farm animals as well as wild animals such as birds. One such bird, Jacquimo, was a friendly swallow who spoke in a different language (French is what he called it). He also had a knack for singing and telling stories. She found enjoyment in spending time with her new animal friend whom offered her rides on his back and showed her the sights of the land. He sang with her, and discussed his favorite fairytales. They kept in touch with Jacquimo informing her that should she ever need him for anything she should whistle and he would surely come find her. With time she grew used to her limbs that were graceful at times and sent her awkwardly stumbling at other times. Though despite the trouble her tiny body often put her in she felt she was becoming slowly accustomed to her new world and managed to get by intact each day, always getting out of trouble in just the knick of time. Though she felt everything was as it should be she couldn't help but silently resent the fact that she was tiny, wondering if she would ever find someone her size to interact with, maybe even fall in love with. It was perhaps the feeling that there was something missing from her life which led her to go flying occasionally with Jacquimo or go off on walks, the wonderful sun her constant companion. It was a beautiful day in Thumbelina's opinion. Her mother had given her permission to wander the woods, provided she was back by late afternoon and took the family dog Hero with her. Hero's guidance was due to several factors, one in which she left home on a particularly nice day when daydreaming and singing and was snatched by a mother bird gathering food for its young. She was so frightened she didn't think to call Jacquimo and was saved by the timely intervention of bees that made a hive right above the birds nest, because they had been made fractious by the onslaught of wings and chirping. Whatever the case, the incident conditioned her to fear birds, except her swallow friend Jacquimo. Another reason for Hero's accompaniment on her walks was the close bond they had developed in the weeks since her birth. He was essentially her guard dog when she was sleeping and provided a comfort during cold nights, sleeping near her to share body heat and barking in a language she could surprisingly understand. She would cling to his side, counting down the time until sunrise, yearning for the warmth of the sun. But she also came to find, due to the words of her mother, comfort in the moon and stars; their silver glow promising tranquility and peace. Thumbelina alternated between enjoying the sights of the forest around her, reveling in the warmth of the sun on her face, and doing her best to avoid Hero's drool as she was walking near him since every so often a dollop of his spittle would nearly fall down on her like huge raindrops, which she felt she could drown in, or worse yet, get on her dress and hair. Plus, she smelled Hero's breath before which wouldn't exactly make her smell pleasant. She hoisted a metal thimble in her arms which her mother gave her so she could gather some of the sun kissing smelling foliage to take home. She would gather what she'd find on the ground, herbs mostly and flower which she found that she had an attachment to, and Hero would grab plants that were too high for her to reach. Her mother had told her about the other seasons and she found that while she wasn't looking forward to the cold of autumn and winter she knew her mother would provide her with the shelter and clothes needed to endure it. As she walked along she was stunned by the sounds of the forest and thought to include her own music into the foray. She thought long over what she wanted to sing about and opening her mouth, a sweet airy passage from a book sprang forth she remembered reading from during April's lessons. She often found herself using her imagination to ease boredom and turning poems into songs would be one of her ways of doing so. It put Hero at ease as soon as he heard it. As she sang she imagined her mother reading to her and it put her at ease. \" Oh detritus of falling leaves Encased below ever warming seas The saccharine nectar spreads on my lips Blowing warmth to others with your sips Feeling the warmth with my hands Spreading joy across the lands A calming feeling drapes upon your form\" She stopped suddenly as they passed a pond. She caught the sparkle of the sunlight in the water with her eyes and continued with her song unaware of the ponds occupants, including one now amorous toad named Grendel whom was voicing his opinion to his mother that he was enamored by Thumbelina and her singing. \" Beautiful shade shields you briefly As I carry you with me most politely Cradling a lovely smile in my dream Letting your goodness reign supreme\" Hero twitched his ears at a sudden rustling of leaves and barked at Thumbelina. She jumped upon hearing a fluttering of wings. \"Hiya toots!\" Cackled an obnoxious high voice in between peals of laughter. Upon seeing the ugly beetle before her Thumbelina suddenly found herself regretting how her voice seemed to travel and enrapture all who heard it.

She wept great tears of sorrow; alone, beaten and broken. Buried deep in the torment of emotional and physical despair. Thumbelina tilted her head, almost hearing the glimmer of that familiar and youthful melody once sang to her by her lover. \" Let me be your wings. Let me be your only love. Let me take you far beyond the stars...\" \"THUMBELINA!\" Mr. Beetle, the manager of the Love Shack, buzzed; signaling the call for the next customer to come in. He untied her. \" Oh Cornelius...\" She whimpered. Thumbelina knew that she would never see her handsome prince ever again, Mr. Beetle reminded her of this daily. She slowly simpered into the bed next to the usual customer, Jachimo the narrative sparrow. \"Get your sweet ass over here.\" He said in a rough voice. The sweet, soothing French accent no longer existed in bed. He was a morbid fan of role-play. Tonight he was a Russian mobster and she was a sexy, American, pirate. Mr. Beetle closed the door with a smirk, pleased the sounds of sex in the background; the lights went dim. Cornelius POV Frozen tears; frozen heartbeats; memories locked in the chambers of my mind. I cringed at the sound of her name as it flew off of my lips and my tender tongue. I was too late to save her; it was my fault. When I discovered her tragic fate was sealed, I flew to the help of my parents. But to no avail. I remembered the conversation I had had with them. \" I'm sorry son, but she's a whore now, tainted, and could never be the future fairy queen.\" The fairy ruler stated with the pounding of his staff. \" You'll have to forget her! Before that, you must by all costs retrieve the ring that you had given her. It's a family heirloom!\" The fairy queen demanded.

Thumbelina turned to what she thought was just another meaningless face, but there he stood. The one she called her only love. Her shining knight. Her hero. \"Corny! Oh! You've found me!\" Thumbelina attempted to throw herself into the arm's of her fairy prince, but he rejected. \"Stop! I'm sorry but I only came here for my ring.\" He awkwardly explained. Thumbelina, dumbstruck, even more so than usual, shakily took off and returned the ring. \"Well... I've got to go! There's the fairy ball tonight and Mother is making me dance with every girl that arrives. But it was great to see you, good luck on life!\" He cheerily said goodbye and left. Thumbelina felt the sickening numbness gravitate throughout her entire body. She felt light, like she was flying. Then all of a sudden, POOF!

So, I decided that I had to write it. DISCLAIMER: THIS IS PURELY FANMADE. I OWN NOTHING. PLEASE DO NOT STEAL. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN USING ANY PART OF/OR ADOPTING THIS STORY, PLEASE PM ME FOR PERMISSION. Chapter 1: Once Upon a Time... Today was an exhausting day for me. My older sister had asked to babysit for her, and she just picked up my 5 year-old niece. She was like a wound up spring that just wouldn't unwind. To say the day was busy would have been an understatement. From having to follow her down stairs, to looking for toys, to having to chase my three dogs with her in the backyard, to many other things. My brief moments of relief only came when she asked for a snack, or sat down to watch episodes of My Little Pony, (which I was secretly a fan of). Finally, I some time to myself. So I decided to watch one my favorite movies of my childhood, Thumbelina. Being in the mood for a rush of nostalgia, I found myself going through my bookshelf of movies, I finally found the one I was searching for. put the disc in the DVD player, and pressed Play on the remote. Leo went over to my recliner and climbed onto the seat. He was obviously waiting for me, so I climbed in beside him, and kicked out the footstool. As the movie started, a big smile spread across my face as I heard an instrumental version of my favorite song, \"Let Me Be Your Wings\". No doubt I would be singing along later. I giggled to myself as I grabbed one of our plush blankets, and settled in the chair, ready to enjoy the movie. The words, Once Upon a Time in Paris appeared on screen. They were followed by a bird in flight, singing and gliding through the city. La, la la la la la la la la la If you follow your heart ho, ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho When you follow your heart The bird landed on top of a building and turned towards the audience, removing his hat in introduction, \"Hello! Welcome to Paris, city of love. Who am I? I am Jacquimo! Swallow Extraordinaire, and lover of beautiful things.\" Jacquimo placed his hat back on his head, and took off in flight, singing once more. You're, sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart. You're sure to fly on magical wings, When you follow your heart! Jacquimo dipped a wing in the river as he glided past a bridge, and flew up to land on top of a statue that was perched on one of the towers of Notre Dame, \"Oh, that is very nice, nes pas? And I like what it is saying. It is saying, follow your heart, and nothing is impossible!\" He took off again disappearing through a cracked stained-glass window, landing in what seemed to be a makeshift home. \"You're sure to do impossible things,\" Jacquimo sang, extending the note. He let out a high-pitched \"oh.\" Then he said, blowing a kiss, \"I love the sound of my voice.\" Jacquimo started singing once more, finishing his song with a flourish. When you follow your heart! When you follow your heart! He then got comfortable and leaned back into a big plush cushion, \"I love great romances. I myself am a swallow of great pleasure.\" He gestured to a vast array of books and said, \"These are stories about people with impossible problems.\" He then proceeded to list a few of the books, and then added with a chuckle, \"But the most impossible of all the stories, is impossibly small. The story of Thumbelina.\" After the movie was over, I moved a few loose stands of blond hair out of my face, then proceeded to get up. After shutting the TV off, and decided to get ready for bed. Slipping on a black long-sleeved shirt with matching Mickey Mouse bottoms, I was about to climb into bed, when I heard my mom yell, \"Violet! Could you take the dogs out please?\" Letting out, a heavy sigh and slipped into the fuzzy purple slippers that I had gotten as a present last year. \"Leo, Misty, Bailey!\" I called, as they came running to greet me at the back door. Opening the door, I barely had time to move out of the way before the dogs bolted out the door. As I followed out behind them, I took in the refreshing scents of our nearby flower garden. I laughed as I watched Leo attacked Bailey, almost dangling by her collar, While Misty just laid down, happily content in the grass. I grabbed one of our fold-out lawn chairs and placed it in my favorite spot, on the small porch, with my two rose bushes on both sides. Noticing my bushes needed water, I went into the garage to grab the watering can. After the plants were watered, I sat down and watched Bailey break up a small fight that had broken out between Misty and Leo. Then Bailey proceeded to lick little Leo clean. I smiled; sure that Bailey would make an awesome mom one day. As I waited for the dogs to finish their business, I inhaled the sweet scent of my pink roses, but before I knew it, I had already dozed off. Just before I drifted off to dreamland, I swore I could hear Jacquimo's voice off in the distance. His words were soft, but I was able to make out four words before falling asleep completely, \"Once Upon a Time.\" A/N: So there's the first chapter.

She remembers being born. Long grass, an empty tea kettle, the scent of rain from the day before; three other bodies beside her and all of them looking for a teat to drink from, hungry . She remembers her family being killed by a housecat from the big farm on the hill. A Calico with one bad eye and a bobbed tail, claws digging into her parents' hides first and then setting her jaws to grind and devour her brothers; the last thing she saw of them as she hid among the reeds of the river was her deep brown brother's arm dropped to the ground while the cat considered whether to spit him out at the taste flooding her mouth when she bit into his stomach and tasted the wheat he'd eaten for breakfast . She remembers how long it took her to dig three feet underground and begin building her own home right next door to a rather rich aristocrat of a mole. Three months in dry heat and then a flash flooding thunderstorm, mud encasing her clothes and then her fur; water entrenching her lungs for days after contracting pneumonia that had nearly killed her . She remembers meeting Mr. Mole for the first time. His big hands offering up a golden hairpin with a white pearl on the end of it for a welcome gift to the neighborhood, his blind eyes unable to see just how bad she looked wracked with a burning hot fever and swaddled in as many blankets as she had in her possession after finishing construction of her house, his nose alerting him to the fact that she barely had warm coals in her fireplace and that she was really very sick; all leading him to haul her up clumsily to his own house, set her down in front of his roaring fire and made her a poor excuse for tea, but after the days of sickness it was almost like heaven for Ms. Field Mouse. He kept her there until her cough was gone and all the while told her stories of his youth and discovering his fortune through mere curiosity and luck . She remembers finding Thumbelina. Poor thing from all the rumors spread around about the hub-bub at the Fairy Court and then the Beetle Ball asleep and half frozen in an old shoe on the hill. She'd hate to think of what might have happened if she hadn't gone out that morning looking for ingredients for her corncakes and dry wood for her fireplace . She remembers feeling so very bad about being the one to tell her that her prince was dead like it was nothing at all and then trying to brush it off with a visit to Mr. Mole. No young girl—odd tiny human-thing or fairy or field mouse—wants to visit an old man after hearing from a complete stranger that the love of their life is dead and gone; but really, Miss Field Mouse had nothing else to go on. She couldn't think with Thumbelina writhing in agony of loss in the mouse's comforter and she'd never been good with any company other than Mr. Mole's and a few of the Jitterbugs. It was the best she could do under the circumstances and she defied anyone who thought that they could do better . She remembers feeling oddly betrayed by the mole when he asked her to find a way to get Thumbelina to marry him when the girl was looking over the dead bird he'd taken them to see. She took his money, of course she took his money, but it didn't help and, if anything, made her prod more than forcefully to get Thumbelina to consider over the proposal. If it had been anyone else, Miss Field Mouse may have given up after the first hour of prodding and given the money back—disappointed old man or no. But, in a strange way that a mouse should not feel for most creatures (other than other mice, of course, she wasn't a savage), she felt obligated to get Mr. Mole what he wanted. When the girl accepted the next day, Miss Field Mouse put on a happy face, but was more irritated underneath her skin (the wedding dress she'd chosen for Thumbelina more than revealing her true feelings of the event; disgusting grey thing that it was ). She remembers calling out Thumbelina's name in admonishment when the girl had gotten to the altar and told Mr. Mole he would never marry him because she didn't love him. She crossed her arms, ready to march up there, haul the girl out to the hall and give her a good talking to about what they'd talked about (marriage had nothing to do with love; it was just a partnership of two consenting parties where they would take care of each other until one of them died) the other night, but felt something odd other than surprise and fright when Mr. Toad crashed the party. Something akin to excitement rose up in her as they chased the girl and then the toad and then the beetle and then (wonders!) the prince down the tunnel that lead to Up There . She remembers after the tunnel rained down Mr. Mole's treasure and the days following. She and Mr. Mole had been astounded to hear of Thumbelina marrying the Prince in a grand ceremony in the Veil of the Fairies. Mr. Mole had shrugged it off and said that there would be other girls—always . They are all fond memories that Miss Field Mouse dare not forget, because those shining shadows in her mind that bring up such emotion that she often cannot give names to on most days keep her visiting her dear friend in not-obligation but in the attempt to rectify something she'd told Thumbelina the night before her crashed wedding. \" Love? Love is what we read about in books, my dear .\" She had been proven wrong by Miss Thumbelina marrying through that divine love that had brought the Fairy Prince back from death and beyond to find his love in the young woman. It stood to reason that, maybe, a simple kind of love from a friend to a friend could exist somewhere not in story books, but in a tunnel shared between a mouse and a mole. Maybe she would remember that as she finished up a batch of corncakes and tucked them into a basket, the shawl she'd pressed the day before wrapped professionally on her shoulders as Miss Field Mouse smiled and made down the tunnel. She hummed a song she'd heard on the wind a few days ago while out near the river looking for herbs and such; a large French swallow twittering-twittering-twittering. \"… You don't need a chart to guide you…Close your eyes and look inside you …\" ","Summary":" Title: Oh, Memory Summary: Things to remember, things to forget.

A beam of sunshine gold bounces off the dreary clouds. A slight gray mist lazily lays over the village. A small sailboat rocks down the river. And a kingdom slowly welcomes the start of a new day. Farmers awake to till the fields. Bookkeepers open their shops doors. Mothers wake their children up for school. And priests begin their morning prayer. It is a quiet morning like any other. Until… \"Oh… La la-la-la-la la-la la la If you follow your heart Ho ho-ho-ho-ho ho-ho ho ho When you follow your heart…. Hello! Welcome to Paris, city of love. Who am I?

I love the sound of my voice. … When you follow your heart When you follow your heart!\" Kicking off his boots and dancing a little jig, the blue swallow drops down on the hat behind him, and putting his hands behind his head, he claims: \"I love great romances. I myself am a swallow of great passion. Vive l'amour .\" And gesturing to the great collection of fine works of the written word, he continues, \"These are stories about the people with impossible problems. Samson loves Delilah . Ah, that was impossible. Romeo et Juliet —Oh, impossible. Ha ha ha ho! But the most impossible of all the stories is impossible small. The story of Thumbelina …. Once upon a time… ~0~ The day was dark and dreary from the summer rain clouds, growing darker as the sun passed the horizon and the land welcomed the black, invincible new moon. Most of the people were off getting cozy in their homes; windows were shut, lights were being put out, and mothers sang their children to sleep. Only few brave souls ventured the wet stoned road, mostly men but the occasional woman. One of these women was dressed in a dark cloak bringing more attention to the pale face it surrounded. Dark bags were found under her eyes and her nose was pink-tipped. She suddenly was racked with coughs as the sky decided to let down buckets of cool water, which quickly soaked the poor woman's clothes. All the other town residences quickly scurried into their warm, dry houses, never looking back at the slowly moving woman. She sneezed and continued on, willing her sore muscles to aid her to a safe spot for the evening. She only made it so far as the secluded house yards away from the main town. Her vision grew blurry before all she saw was black. Her body fell limp onto the ground with a thud, her cloak covering most of her body except for her scraped hands and feet; the rain never stopping its assault on the land below. ~0~ The next time she opened her eyes, she noticed she was staring not at the sky or the ground, but a slightly cracked ceiling. The surface beneath her was soft and comfy. A wet, cold towel was on her forehead and the smell of a freshly made pie hung in the air. And just like she had since her eyes opened, she wondered where she was. \"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" a quiet motherly voice came from her left. She jumped and quickly turned her head to gaze at an old middle aged woman with grey hair and blue eyes. A small smile aligned her red lips and her cheeks were light shade of pink. \"I'm alright, but…\" the woman looked around at the room she was in, and quickly came to the conclusion that she was in the woman's bed, before looking back and asking, \"… what am I doing here?\" \"Why I found you outside, you poor dear. You were burning hot with a fever! It's a good thing I had looked out my window just as you fell or who knows how long you would've been out there!\" \"And you helped me?\" the woman exclaimed totally taken by surprise. \"Of course! Why wouldn't I dear?!\" \"Well, it's just that most people wouldn't take me in, since I will 'cause them problems' they say.\" The woman struggled to sit up, and was only able to manage through the help of the older woman. \"Oh! You're not causing me any problems. I'm happy to help.\" She left the room, only to return a few seconds later carrying a tray of food. \"Here. You need to get some food in that empty stomach of yours, before you go take a bath.\" \"Oh no. I couldn't.\" \"Oh, I insist! Trust me, there's no trouble. I've been wanting a little company anyway…\" The older woman sighed out. \"Well… if you insist.\" Sometime later, after the younger of the two had a full belly and was dry from her bath, the two women sat by the fire place talking about idle things. The elder of the two was knitting a blanket whilst the younger was gazing out the window, not that there was much to see other than a white landscape from how much rain was pouring. She sighed and turned from the depressing scene. Gazing for a moment at her generous host, she said \"I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality. Not many would be as kind as you are to me.\" \"Oh! Think nothing of it, my dear. I couldn't very well leave you out to fend for yourself in the freezing rain in the state you were in.\" Pausing with her knitting for a moment she asked, \"Whatever were you doing outside by your lonesome anyway?\" \"Oh, ah… well-\" Seeing her fumble for an answer, the elder gave her a tender smile. \"It's alright. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I just hope I won't catch you in the rain again.\" Smiling back, the younger giggled. \"Thank you. I hope I won't ever have cause to brave the rain again either.\" Pausing for a moment and glancing around the otherwise empty house, the younger wondered why her host seemed to only have animals for company. Seeing only a slumbering dog in the house and no others, she gnawed at her lip and wondered if she wasn't being too forward when she asked, \"May I ask where your husband is?\" Pausing at her knitting for a long moment, the host stared with glazed eyes at the fire before quietly admitting: \"He's… gone.\" \"Oh.\" Feeling awkward and afraid that she brought up painful memories, the younger sat back and tried of thinking up a new subject of discussion. But just as she opened her mouth, her host said, \"He died from pneumonia four years ago. It was just after a rainstorm like this one when he developed a fever. He had been working on the henhouse outside when the rain hit. He was stubborn, you see, and he didn't want to come inside until the rain was too strong to see through. At first we thought it was a mild cold, until it progressed to the point where he couldn't leave the bed anymore.\" She sniffed, and looked up when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Seeing the look of concern, she swiped at the single tear that escaped her eye-lids. \"I still remember the loud racking cough he had in his last moments.\" \"I'm sorry that I brought up such bad memories,\" the younger said as she rubbed the teary woman's shoulder. \"No, no. It was a reasonable question. I'm sorry that I spouted my burdens on you.\" \"No worries. Hearing your story was the least I could do after you helped me today.\" The rest of the night was spent quietly in each other's company and seeing how the rain was not letting up anytime soon the elder woman insisted upon setting up a bed for the younger one. After much protest, the younger relented and the two slept without further drama until the sun rose in the sky the next morning. The rain had stopped sometime in the night and so with the beginning of the new day, the two ladies parted ways, with the younger continually thanking the elder and insisting that if there was ever anything she could do to help her savior to call upon her without a second thought. The lady of the house smiled and thanked her, never believing that she would take her up on her offer. But as time went by, and loneliness began to weigh down upon her, she found out from gossipers in the town square that the young lady she saved was a witch that lived on the outskirts of town. And thinking back on her once-visitor's insistence to come to her if she ever wished for anything, she began to dress one morning intent on speaking with the witch. After all, she longed to have a child to call her own. Her visit could not have gone more smoothly. Upon arriving at the good witch's home and explaining her desire, the young woman – no longer hiding the wings that marked her as a magical being – jumped at the chance to help the kind woman. Giving her a tiny barleycorn, she said \"Plant it in a flower pot and see what happens.\" The elder did not even for a moment doubt the woman's sincerity and doing as she was told the moment she arrived home, she watched anxiously as each day the flower began growing until at last… \"Oh, what a pretty flower.\" And acting upon impulse, gave the pretty bud a kiss, which, to her surprise, bloomed upon the gentle impact. Staring as the tulip's petals spread, the woman was only mildly surprised at seeing a little girl dressed in white and blue laying in the center of the flower. \"Oh…\" yawned the girl as she stretched her limbs and stood. The tiny being, who looked no older than fourteen years, turned to see a vastly bigger female standing next to her, smiling a tender smile as she gazed at her with twinkling eyes. Already knowing who she is, the little girl walked to the edge of the petal in front of her, calling \"Hello, Mother.\" Tenderly picking up her new daughter with the palm of her hand, she gazed elatedly at the girl and said, \"I will call you Thumbelina.\" ~0~ \"Thumbelina…\" sighed the pretty swallow. \"but can you imagine the troubles for a little girl no bigger than your thumb? Hmm?\" ~0~ \" Who is the girl no bigger than a bumble bee? \" sang a duck before she quacked. \" Who is the angel with a funny name? \" caroled a goat right before little Thumbelina fell into the animal's water bowl. \" Oh, we don't know where she's from or how she came to be \" mooed a cow as he leaned down so that Thumbelina could grab hold of his nose ring, accidently dunking her for a second time, to save her. \" But happy was the day she came Thumbelina She's a funny little squirt Thumbelina Tiny angel in a skirt Thumbelina First she's mending then baking, pretending, she's making things up Thumbelina\" Thumbelina giggled at the antics of her furry and feathery friends. She loved hanging out with them outside on warm, sunny days such as these. They were about the only beings she could actually talk to outside of her mother. Being the tiny being that she was, not many people took notice of her and when they did, most just scoff and ignore her. But she tried not to let feelings of hurt weigh down on her. But still she wondered… Seeing her mother taking up the broom to sweep the yard, Thumbelina grabbed hold of a single feather of the floor. And with thoughts of her size still whirling in her mind, she sang: \" Who would believe the wonder of the world I see \" She tried not to cry as she fell through a hole in the wood and into one of the hens' nest of eggs, right as they began to hatch. \" Each little minute brings a new surprise There's only one peculiar thing that bothers me Seems I'm the only one my size\" When the inside of the henhouse darken a little, Thumbelina looked up to see her mother gazing through the hole down at her. She smiled sheepishly when her mother giggled and left, presumably to open the door for her daughter. After doing so, and finishing up the sweeping, her mother left to get her bag of feed. Seeing their owner walking out of the house with a sack of corn, the chickens clucked and flapped their wings in excitement before running over, as did one of the baby chicks. But fearing that it would get trampled, the chick didn't join in the feeding in time before one the bigger chickens pushed him out of the way. \" Thumbelina Thank the Lord and save our meals Thumbelina Maybe if you had high heels Thumbelina \" Seeing the sad chick's dilemma, Thumbelina took advantage of her size and join the frayed, successfully gathering four pieces of corn without hassle. Chirping happily, the chick rapidly chowed down on two pieces while giving Thumbelina grateful eyes. \" If you stay here forever we know that we'll never be glum By gum!\" Sometime later, Thumbelina found herself helping her mother lode a pie with cherries, one of the few tasks she could successfully do as well. But one rather large cherry, about the same size as she, caused her to lose her balance and she fell into the pie right as her mother closed it off with a layer of dough. \" Thumbelina She is always in the thick Thumbelina \" Squirming her way out of the pie, she got out just as it was raised to her mother's eye level. \" But I get out in the nick \" she sang as she climbed out and pulled off the cherry on her head. \" Thumbelina Fortune sometimes has tricked us but this time it's picked us a plum \" Thumbelina gazed dismayed at the pile of plums she stood on, as picking plums was one of the aforementioned tasks she could not do. Trying to pick even one of the low hanging ones was difficult as one of the ducks had to help her with picking off the twig. \" Oh, a plum so big And a fig so big And they call it a twig But a twig's so big \" Almost at the end of her chores, Thumbelina's mother took this time to join the antics as Thumbelina began running across the field. \" It's a great big world Thumbelina Thumbelina Thumbelina…. That's me! \" Thumbelina giggled, finishing the song the farm animals so carefully crafted together. Having been lifted by her mother, she hugged her mother's thumb as that was the only way she could do so. ~0~ Several hours later, as darkness set upon the little village, Thumbelina's mother sat in the rocking chair she kept in Thumbelina's room, getting ready for story time with her daughter. It was one of the few daughter-mother moments they had where it was just the two of them – not including the ever guarding dog, Hero – with no work needing to be done. Opening one of the many books she collected over the years to share with any child of hers, Thumbelina's mother addressed the girl who sat upon her nose, as she had taken to doing for the past four months, \"Now here's a story about the noble dog (\"Woof, woof\" barked Hero, posing as if he were the character in the book) who saved the king from the wicked wizard. Once upon a time…\" \"Oh, Mother, please\" cried the now fifteen year old girl, whilst looking into her mother's eye. \"Are there any stories about… about little people?\" \"Well, as a matter of fact, there are, Thumbelina. Look.\" Making sure to hold out her hand as she bent over, Thumbelina's mother flipped to another story, and set her daughter upon an illustration of a finely dressed male, only half the size of a mushroom he called a house. Thumbelina gazed wonderingly and amazedly at the little painted figure who couldn't be much taller than herself on the page. This being the first time she heard of others such as she possibly being real, Thumbelina couldn't help but exclaim, \"Oh, they are little, just like me\" as she gestured to the picture. Turning to gaze at it once more, she noticed a peculiar set of objects sprouting from behind the little man. Unable to figure out what they are, she asked \"But—But what are those?\" Smiling at her daughter's enthusiasm, Thumbelina's mother answered, \"They're wings, Thumbelina. These are fairies, and fairies have wings so they can fly.\" Dancing and twirling in her excitement, Thumbelina couldn't help but wonder why she has never seen little people like them. And wondering if they even existed outside of fairy tales, she paused her dancing as she gnawed at her lip in puzzlement. \"Mother, have you ever seen a fairy?\" Cocking her head to the side, and briefly remembering a time in which unexplainable sparkles of light passed her window when she was around her daughter's age, Thumbelina's mother said, \"Well, I thought I did. Once.\" \"Really?\" Thumbelina sighed happily. If her mother claims to have seen one than why couldn't they exist? Her mother giggled. \"Yes, and here, the fairy prince and princess are having a wedding.\" She took off her glasses in order to magnify the image. \"And they lived happily ever after.\" Thumbelina smiled. \"Ho ho ho. Usually, dear.\" Thumbelina's mother said as she fingered the locket around her neck, a gift from her late husband as an anniversary present. Looking at the picture for a moment, Thumbelina couldn't help the pang of sadness that passed through her. Crawling under the glass covering the picture, Thumbelina played with her thumbs a little as she looked up at her mother. \"Hmm. I—I suppose it works best if, uh, if two people are about the same size.\" Creasing her eyebrows a little, Thumbelina's mother hesitantly responded, \"Yes, of—of course.\" \"Yes. Well…\" Turning sad eyes away, Thumbelina stood to sit at the corner of the page. Thumbelina's mother gazed at her sadly, knowing what was going through her mind. \"Well, that's not fair. I—I—I must be the only little person in the whole world.\" She sighed almost teary eyed. \"I wish I were big.\" \"Oh, no, Thumbelina. No. Don't ever wish to be anything but what you are.\" Trying to pat her daughter's shoulder as best as she could with her index finger, Thumbelina's mother didn't even look up when Hero growled and woofed in agreement with her words. When Thumbelina barely even acknowledged her actions, she sighed, and not knowing what else to do called for bedtime. Carrying her daughter over to her nut bed on top of the crib – which was commissioned by her late husband – Thumbelina's mother explained, \"It's been a long day. You must go to sleep now. Sleep tight.\" Setting aside her sadness for the moment, Thumbelina smiled at her mother. \"Mother, will you please leave the book open?\" \"Of course, dear.\" \"I want to look at the pictures while I go to sleep.\" Setting her daughter next to the window and wishing her goodnight, Thumbelina's mother had no idea how much her daughter's world was going to change soon. ~0~ Elsewhere at the same time, away from the prying eyes of the humans inhabiting the same land as them, fairies of all shapes and sizes gathered around the outside of their homes in preparation for the seasonal royal parade the royal family partakes in as they help nature run its course. Many wings fluttered in excitement as neighbors whispered and betted on who was to be a part of the action this season. Aside from the royal family only a pre-selected group of individuals were allowed to help them in their endeavor. Along with being a part of the procession for a brief moment, these helpers got to meet the royal family first hand, and were always given a hefty reward for their troubles at the end of the night. It was a worthy and honorable cause for those lucky fairies, and many longed for the day in which their talents proved useful enough to merit a spot on the committee. But while many viewed this occasion as an extraordinary moment, one particular individual looked upon this time with dread. He could never understand why this event was so grand as it happened four times a year every year. Looking at the white butterfly which was to be transportation, he looked at his mother in exasperation. \"Do I really have to go, Mother?\" \"Of course, son! Why do you even ask? You know this has been a tradition of the royal family for decades now! You can't just skip it and go gallivanting god knows where!\" cried his mother as she waved her wand about, causing golden fairy dust to sparkle across the room. \"Why?! It's not like I help you out much anyway. Need I remind you that I only have this sword in my possession?\" He crossed his arms and glared a little when his mother frowned at him. \"Cornelius, son. We've been over this. As part of the royal family, you must partake in the duties of the royals. What kind of impression on the court will you make if you continually slack on your responsibilities?\" \"But what about what I want to, Mother? I have plenty of time before I have to take over for you and Father! It's just one season. There will be plenty more.\" \"That's what you always say every turn of the season. No, Cornelius. You are not permitted to shack your duties.\" Seeing his son open his mouth to argue some more, Colbert stepped in to assuage the situation. \"Cornelius, please, don't argue with your mother. After all, it is your responsibility as the Crown Prince to 'prance around', as you say. Your time to reign is drawing ever closer and your mother and I worry about you.\" Cornelius sighed exasperated. \"It's not like I haven't done this before, Father.\" \"There is always room for improvement.\" Tabitha chimed in. Cornelius rolled his eyes. \"And besides this is the perfect opportunity for you to make an impression on the available ladies of the court. We're not getting any younger.\" \"Ha! I think it should be the other way around, Mother. None of those girls interest me.\" \"You just haven't found the right one, son.\" Colbert said. Cornelius rolled his eyes and stalked off toward his bumble, which had Tabitha wrinkling her nose at the sight. A few hours later, as night began to paint the sky black and several stars introduced their lights, the royal family and their small entourage prepared to board their designated transportation. But seeing as the Crown Prince was taking his sweet time meandering over, Tabitha began to get irritated at the delay. \"Where is he?!\" \"Tabitha dear, relax. He'll come eventually.\" \"He needs to be here now!\" she cried just as Cornelius appeared around the corner. \"Where were you?!\" \"Admiring the artwork, Mother.\" Cornelius claimed cheekily. In truth, he was making plans with a certain bumble in hopes of escaping the dull parade. No way will he spend the whole night sitting on a butterfly while he could be out exploring. \"Admiring the—Oh, never mind. We're late! Hurry up!\" Tabitha glared as her son slowly waltzed over to the white butterfly, looking as if the world would wait for him, before turning and fixing her dress. Signaling to the others in her party to begin takeoff, she sighed when she heard from behind her: \"Are you sure I can't take Buzzby?\" ~0~ \"You take good care of her, Hero.\" Getting a muttered response of compliance back, Thumbelina's mother made her way out the room. Waiting until her mother's footsteps could no longer be heard, Thumbelina leapt out of her nut bed to gaze upon the book once more. Giving a curtsy to the painted fairy prince, Thumbelina bit her lip and walked closer to the window. \" I know there's someone, somewhere, someone Who's sure to find me soon …\" Picking her skirt up, Thumbelina gazed at her reflection in the different colored panels of the window. \" After the rain goes There are rainbows I'll find my rainbow soon \" Hearing the beautiful voice of his charge, Hero leapt upon the desk with a happy sigh. \" Soon it won't be just pretend Soon, a happy ending Love, can you hear me? If you're near me Sing your song Sure and strong And soon \" Letting the note resound across the room, Thumbelina crept closer to the image until her lips settled upon the males painted cheek. \"I wonder if there really are such things as fairies. Hmm…\" ~0~ As more and more stars littered the sky, golden hues of dust fell on the plants and trees that covered the ground for miles and miles around. Stems and leaves turned from brilliant shades of green into bright shades of orange and red. Fruits and vegetables everywhere grew ripe for the picking and a slight cold breeze began to blow through the foliage, bringing testimony to the successful work of the fairies flying through. Tabitha smiled with pride seeing her fairy dust at work, at least, until she turned and saw the empty seat where her son was supposed to be instead of just his crown. \"Oh, my dear. D-Don't look now, dear husband, but our son is missing again.\" Can't say she wasn't too surprised. She didn't fool herself into thinking that their earlier conversation would get anywhere with him. Looking to where his wife gestured, Colbert answered, \"So he is. I think he feels a bit silly riding that white butterfly we gave him.\" \"Why should he feel silly?\" Tabitha frowned. She found the butterfly to be quite astonishing. \"It doesn't quite make the right impression on the young ladies,\" Colbert retorted as he grabbed a leaf within his reach to hand to his wife, unconcerned over his son's whereabouts. If he had been forced to ride a butterfly during his youth, he would be embarrassed too. \"Well, what about the impression on the court? Colbert, my love, it is autumn today, and we've begun the golding of the leaves. He should be here!\" \"Tabitha…\" \"He'll hurt himself. I just hope he's not out buzzing the vales on that wretched bumblebee. He is the crown prince, for heaven's sake.\" Her leaf fan kept flapping faster and faster as her nervous rambling progressed. Placing his hand over his wife's, Colbert chuckled. \"Tabitha, dear, have you forgotten what it's like to be 16?\" Neither of them noticed as said aforementioned bumblebee, along with its royal rider, passed right through the dandelions they had just sprinkled dust over. \"I don't remember ever being this reckless when I was 16.\" Tabitha ground out. \"Maybe not as often as our son, but I do remember our courting days. Remember when we snuck out to fly with the northern winds? And how long it took us to find our way back?\" Colbert chuckled out. Tabitha blushed and huffed slightly. \"I'll give him two more hours to himself. Nothing more.\" ~0~ Cornelius couldn't help but bellow his laughter. He had managed to escape! And without his parents noticing! No doubt they knew by now but it was too late to catch him! \"Great job, Buzzby! It couldn't have gone more perfectly!\" Cornelius grinned as his bumblebee buzzed back in reply and sped up his trek across the small town they were in. \"Now to find something to d-What was that?\" Hearing a humming noise a little ways off, Cornelius steered his ride a little further into town. Passing a slightly open window, and hearing the humming noise briefly increase in volume, Cornelius pulled back at the antennae in his hands. \"Whoa!\" he cried, flying back a little, and getting off Buzzby to investigate the noise, Cornelius was slightly surprised to see a human – who was to his surprise just a few centimeters shorter than him – dancing next to the window sill. And a beautiful human girl at that. \"Oh, hello…\" was whispered as the prince gazed at the girl in amazement. \"I wonder who she is.\" Looking a little longer at the twirling girl, Cornelius decided to take a closer look. \"Stay here, boy. I'll check this out.\" Walking across the windowsill close to the wall, Cornelius couldn't have been more glad – and amused – that the girl's eyes were closed. But not wanting to take any chances he waited until she twirled away before squiring over behind the book, trying to make his footsteps as silent as possible. Once he was certain that she couldn't see the light all fairies emitted when they take flight, he took to the air and flew slowly, keeping his own natural twinkling noises as low as possible until he reached the open page. He smirked at the image of the 'fairy prince' and almost let loose a chuckle when he heard \"Oh, do you have to go now?\" coming from the girl. Seems someone is interested in seeing a fairy prince. \" I see.\" He looked down at the sword on his hip and slowly dragged it out, biting down on his lip to hold back his smile. \" You are a wonderful dancer.\" He most certainly was. \" Will I ever see you again?\" Deciding to play along with the humorous girl, Cornelius prepared to cut through the paper, being sure to aim for the 'window'. \"May I cut in?\" In hindsight, suddenly talking and waving a sword at a girl that didn't know he was there probably wasn't the best idea. Seeing the girl gasp in fright, before running toward a ceramic figure, Cornelius really should have thought his plan out better. \"No, wait. Wait! Come back!\" Dropping down to the closed book on the floor, Cornelius shook his head as the girl dropped into the oddly shaped ceramic figure. \"Oh, I—I apologize. I didn't mean to frighten you.\" Seeing something white wave into his peripheral vision, Cornelius looked at the sword still in his hand. \"Oh! Tsk tsk tsk.\" He forgot that he was still waving the thing around. Sliding the sword back into its sheath, he called out to her, \"There. See? No more sword.\" And flying over to the opening at the top, he looked down at her, and asked \"Now will you come out?\" The girl gazed at him for a moment and he laid his head down on his hand, signaling with his other that he was waiting. Giving a wiggle of his fingers in greeting, as the girl turned and went up the hole in the side, he wondered why the girl still hid herself. Looking up and seeing that the girl was actually coming out of her hiding spot, he \"ah\"-ed in understanding. \"W—Wait—Wait a minute. What are you staring at?\" he asked, upon seeing the peculiar look on her face. Getting annoyed, he jumped closer, only to have her back away. \"Say something, will you.\" \"You're…\" She gasped, finally. \"You're one of them.\" She gestured to the picture Cornelius saw earlier and he couldn't help but wonder what was so amazing. Didn't this girl ever see a fairy before? She must have, cause she was most definitely not a human at that size. Confused, Cornelius asked, \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I thought I was the only one my size in the whole world.\" So she hadn't seen a fairy before, but how is she here than? As far as he knew, only fairies had human-like appearances and no human he had ever seen before was the same size as them. But at the same time, she had to be a human. He had never heard of a fairy ever being born wingless before. Whatever she is, she certainly is beautiful, though . Cornelius thought to himself. But his thought process was interrupted upon hearing a growl from behind him. Not stopping to wonder how he missed the giant dog when he entered, Cornelius took out his sword and jumped in front of the lady. But apparently the lady didn't need any saving. \"Oh no. Hero, no, no, no. He's a friend. Look.\" Smiling at the dog awkwardly as his 'friend' gestured to him, Cornelius looked back at her in puzzlement. \"Uh, hello. My name is Thumbelina. How do you do, sir?\" What was she doing? \"Uh, thank you—thank you for coming to visit.\" Looking down and seeing her hand gesture and the pleading look she gave him, Cornelius finally figured out what was going on. \"Oh, Oh, Oh. No trouble at all. The—the pleasure is mine.\" He played along, looking back at her constantly to make sure he was doing this, whatever this was, right. He felt kind of silly bowing to the dog. Gazing at her as she continued to smile at the dog, Cornelius once again had to admire how beautiful the girl was. And her voice! Oh man, was her voice the most beautiful thing he had ever heard. Peculiar, though she was, she was interesting to him. His smile widened when she looked back at him. \"Ooh! Sorry about that.\" Thumbelina said. Oh yes, was Cornelius happy to know her name now. \"Thumbelina.\" He sighed. He liked how it rolled off his tongue so easily. \"Oh, it's a lovely name.\" Thumbelina blushed at the compliment and smiled bashfully. \"Thank you.\" \"I'm Cornelius.\" \"C-Cornelius. Ha ha ha! Well, that's a funny name.\" Catching how rude that might sound, Thumbelina amended, \"Oh, I—I mean, it's perfect.\" Not taking offense, Cornelius just moved closer, and seeing as she had her back turned, he raised his arms to wrap around— She turned. \"Uh, tell me about the fairy court.\" Trying to play off his gesture, Cornelius acted coy as she asked, \"Is there a-a-a prince?\" Smirking in amusement, he mumbled \"Yes.\" He wondered what she'd do if she found out that he was the prince in question. \"He must be terribly handsome.\" Of course. \"Oh, he is.\" \"Strong and brave.\" Oh yes, please keep going. \"None like him.\" \"I would love to meet the prince.\" I love meeting you too. \"Oh, I'll tell him.\" This close to her he couldn't help but see how beautiful her eyes were or how nice she smelled. Thumbelina blushed under his intense gaze as he moved his face closer. \"Oh, thank you.\" \"Oh, you're welcome.\" Her lips looked so nice. Buzzby buzzed. \"What was that?\" Really?! Frowning in annoyance when her back was turned, Cornelius answered. \"Oh, that's Buzzby, my bumble. See I left him on the sill. He doesn't like staying in one place too long.\" Cornelius could swear the bumble had done that on purpose. \"Why didn't you say something? Come on.\" Surprised at having his hand suddenly snatched, Cornelius followed her without protest. Upon arriving outside and seeing the bumblebee waiting on her sill, Thumbelina let out a gasp of astonishment. What a beautiful bumble! \"Oh, my. Why he—he's amazing.\" Seeing the girl's amazement and delight, Cornelius got a sudden idea. \"Hey, would you like to go for a spin?\" Thumbelina paused for a moment, looking at the bumble. She had never ridden one before, especially with a guy she just met. Oh, what would her mother think if she saw her now? \"I don't know…\" she answered, playing with her fingers. Cornelius got closer to her, and grabbed at her hands. \"Come on. What are you worrying about? I promise I won't drop you.\" She bit her lip. This would be her first time leaving the house without her mother or even Hero with her. Cornelius, seeing her indecision, thought quickly of places that might appeal to her, and when a certain place crossed his mind, he grinned widely. Putting pressure on her hands to bring her attention back to him, he slyly asked, \"Have you even seen lightning bugs?\" That got her attention. \"Lightning bugs?\" she asked wonderingly. \"Yes, lightning bugs, bugs that glow brightly at night. I know where they live….\" Cornelius said in his best persuasive tone. Seeing her thoughtful look slowly turn into a smile, he grinned. Throwing caution to the wind, Thumbelina allowed Cornelius to lift her up onto his bumble, and grabbing hold of his waist after he hopped on, Thumbelina smiled at the thought of a new adventure. She hoped to have many more, maybe even with the man sitting in front of her. Unknowingly to her, Cornelius' thoughts ran along the same lines. ~0~ Riding on a bumblebee had to be the most thrilling moment of Thumbelina's life. Never, not even when she rode on Hero's back or sat on her mother's shoulder, had she gone so fast and seen so many sights as she did now. Feeling the wind flowing through her hair and adrenaline racing down her veins, Thumbelina couldn't help but laugh and squeal every time Cornelius took a rough turn or sped down in a spiral. Cornelius, for his part, was paying more attention to the girl sitting against his back than the passing scenery. This was the first time he had taken anyone with him on Buzzby and he couldn't be happier. He grinned whenever she let loose a laugh, and purposely turned without warning just to feel her snuggle into him tighter. In fact, he took the longer route to their destination just to have her with him for a little longer. Arriving at their destination a few minutes later, Cornelius guided his bumble to land behind a fern, and quickly climbing off, he offered a hand to Thumbelina. He gulped slightly when her dress rode up a little on her way down. \"Where are the lightning bugs?\" Thumbelina asked, shaking Cornelius out of his thoughts. He quietly shushed her quickly, and grabbing her hand, he whispered, \"Stay quiet. They don't really like company and they get spooked easily. And—And cover your eyes.\" He smiled at her. \"Why?\" \"Please? I want it to be a surprise.\" Thumbelina pursed her lips but did as he said. A moment later she felt a tug on her hand and an arm wrap around her waist. Putting her trust into her companion, Thumbelina let him lead her under upturned roots, over rocks and gravel, and through tall grass blades. Feeling him pull away, she stayed where she was, until he pressed on her back and quietly whispered, \"Okay, now open them.\" Thumbelina could never have imagined the sight that befell her eyes. Looking up at the sky from a clearing in the middle of the forest, Thumbelina gasped in delight at the many floating lights up ahead. Twinkling like the stars millions of miles above, the lightning bugs swayed and danced in the new autumn breeze. With the coming of the new season, these precious bugs were preparing their homes to house them until next summer. Being one of the few bugs to hibernate this early, they had a lot of work left to do. Looking down at the wonder on his companion's face, Cornelius was glad to have caught them in time to show Thumbelina. He hadn't much appreciated the view when he first discovered the place but seeing how Thumbelina reacted to it, he took in the sight with a new found appreciation. Although… he much rather liked gazing at the girl in his arms instead. \"Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?\" Thumbelina mumbled. \"Yes. Definitely,\" Cornelius breathed, still looking at her. Feeling that he was talking about something else, Thumbelina turned and blushed when she caught him looking at her. Was he was talking about her? Thumbelina thought that he was, but having never met any other male her size, she didn't know if she was attractive or not. Her mother told her she was pretty but all mothers tell their children that. Right? Deciding not to comment, Thumbelina leaned against Cornelius a little more as they both watched the fireflies flitter about until only a handful were left in the sky. Hearing Buzzby start to buzz with boredom, Cornelius led Thumbelina back to their transportation. And just like before, took the longest route back to her house, with many more twists and turns than before. Landing on her windowsill again, Cornelius helped Thumbelina down reluctantly, knowing that the night was quickly coming to an end. Thumbelina, for her part, also felt saddened that they were back home, but still riding off the adrenaline of the flight and the lightning bug display, she giggled and twirled. Cornelius laughed at her display. \"So I take you had fun?\" Cornelius asked, already knowing the answer forthcoming. \"Oh, yes! Very much. I have never seen anything like it before! Do you think we can do it again?\" Thumbelina enthusiastically implored. Cornelius was delighted at the prospect. This meant she wanted to see him again! \"Of course! But we're going to have to wait until summer comes again,\" he replied, but seeing her face fall slightly, he quickly said, \"But we can do other things in the mean time. Like tomorrow?\" \"Tomorrow?\" Thumbelina perked up. He wanted to see her tomorrow? \"Yes. Do you want to?\" Cornelius implored hopefully. \"Yes!\" Thumbelina squealed. \"Yes, of course.\" \"Great!\" Cornelius exclaimed, doing a turn in his excitement. \"I can't wait.\" \"Until tomorrow, good sir.\" Thumbelina said playfully. Playing along, Cornelius answered \"Until tomorrow, my lady.\" ~0~ And the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that , until finally Cornelius had been visiting Thumbelina every night for the past two months without failure. He was surprised at how long their meetings had been going on, especially as he wasn't originally looking for a relationship with anybody. And yes, he said relationship. Although he hadn't outright asked to court Thumbelina, both of them knew that their relationship was far more than just mere friendship. Cornelius smiled at the thought of being in a relationship with his beautiful Thumbelina. Never had he expected to find the girl of his dreams that night he snuck away, but here he was, currently flying toward her window for the nth time in a row. Arriving at his love's home, Cornelius took a moment to see if her mother was in the room before fluttering through the window. On the lookout for his dear Thumbelina, he called out, \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina, are you here?\" \"Down here!\" Looking in the direction her voice came from, Cornelius flew over to the fireplace where Thumbelina sat trying to keep warm as the night's grew colder and colder the closer to winter it got. Upon setting foot on the floor, he braced himself for Thumbelina's hug, and whirled her around when he had her in his arms. \"Hello, Thumbelina.\" He chuckled. \"Cornelius! Oh, what a surprise. What are you doing here so early?\" cried Thumbelina in excitement. Cornelius laughed. \"I just missed you so much.\" \"You saw me yesterday!\" Thumbelina laughed in reply. \"I know. I just had to see you.\" Cornelius said, momentarily forgetting what the real reason he had gone to collect her so early for was. A growl and huff from behind alerted them to the un-amused forgotten third inhabitant of the room. Turning at the sound, Cornelius smiled, bowed, and said \"And hello to you too, Hero.\" Getting a mumble, smile, and a head shake in greeting from the dog before he went back to sleep now that he knew no danger was present, Cornelius shook his head in amusement. Turning back to Thumbelina, a thought passed his mind, and he snapped his fingers. \"Oh, yes! Now I remember. Will you come with me, Thumbelina? There's something I want to show you.\" \"Now?\" Thumbelina breathed, biting her lip worryingly. Every other time they had gone on an adventure, they had done so while the moon was already up in the sky. The moon was nowhere close to coming out yet. Cornelius grabbed at her hands. \"Yes, now. I know we normally go out later but this can't wait.\" He stepped closer to her as he continued to stare into her eyes. \"Please Thumbelina?\" Thinking it over for a bit, Thumbelina came to a conclusion. Turning away from Cornelius, she called out to Hero. \"Hero? Hero, do you think you can distract Mother for a bit?\" Cornelius beamed but Hero snuffed and growled in denial. \"Oh please, Hero? It's just for a few hours.\" Thumbelina begged. Hero grumbled some more. \"Please? There's no other big, strong dog like you around I can trust.\" Knowing where Thumbelina was going, Cornelius played along with \"She's right, Hero. I've never seen a more worthy dog than you around. You must be the best of them all.\" Cornelius grinned. Hero, hearing the praise being thrown at him, posed much like he did when Thumbelina's mother talked about the story of the noble dog who rescued the king. Giving a bark, Hero grinned with pride before happily nodding at his charge and her friend. \"Oh, thank you, Hero!\" Thumbelina exclaimed, already being pulled by Cornelius toward the window where Buzzby awaited them. \"I'll take good care of her, Hero. Don't you worry, boy.\" Cornelius told him. After helping Thumbelina up onto his bumble, Cornelius took off as fast as he could toward the festivities hosted by the humans. Every year, as far as he could tell, inhabitants of the human village celebrated the end of a good harvest, and remembering the location of the one he found last year, Cornelius took a detour that morning just to see if it was still there. It was, and he could only hope that Thumbelina found the celebration to be as fascinating as he found it. He couldn't have been more right. Upon catching sight of the first stalls of the festivals, Thumbelina squealed, \"Oh, the autumn festival?! You took me to the autumn festival!\" Cornelius chuckled. \"I take it you like it?\" \"Yes! I've heard stories about it but Mother never bothered to come.\" Thumbelina replied. \"Thank you for bringing me, Cornelius.\" Cornelius hugged her to him. \"Anything for you, darling\" he said, making Thumbelina blush at the endearment. Grabbing hold of Buzzby's antennae again, Cornelius encouraged the bumblebee to fly closer to the stalls to which Thumbelina ooh-ed and ahh-ed over the merchandise being sold. They even got to see one of the many performances a traveling group passing by presented from behind a pillar. Unfortunately, neither one of them could join in the festivities on account of one being no bigger than a thumb and another being of a different species. But aside from that one detail, the couple immensely enjoyed seeing the sights and smells. Hearing music off in the distance, Cornelius directed Buzzby toward the sound, and feeling Thumbelina start to wiggle in rhythm to the music, instructed Buzzby to land in one of the trees. Jumping off of the bumble, Cornelius turned to see Thumbelina looking confused. Bowing and holding out his hand Cornelius asked, \"May I have this dance, my lady?\" \"Oh!\" Thumbelina said with realization, and grinning, took him up on his offer. \"Why, of course, kind sir.\" She grabbed at the outstretched hand. They started off with a slow waltz but as the music they listened to increased in tempo so did their steps until eventually they ended up close to a body of water close by. And seeing how still and calm the waters were, Cornelius held on to Thumbelina tightly as he stepped onto the small lake. Slightly surprised, Thumbelina tightened her hold on Cornelius' hand, expecting to fall in the water any second. But when she remained dry and still suspended in the air, she turned surprised eyes to Cornelius. Getting a reassuring smile in return, Thumbelina relaxed her hold slightly, trusting that Cornelius wouldn't suddenly allow her to suddenly plummet into the frigid waters below. She smiled when they began to glide across the surface of the lake in a dance not unlike those of ice-skaters. But the lake was a small one and soon their dance of over. However, to Thumbelina's surprise, the other side of the lake was privy to a nice stone chateau. Scurrying over to a small slab of rock wall, Thumbelina turned to sit down, with Cornelius not far behind her. Throwing one leg over the rock and then the other, Cornelius shimmied close to Thumbelina. Throwing an arm across her shoulders and another across her waist, Cornelius leaned his head on Thumbelina's, just breathing in the scent of her hair. He sighed in contentment. Thumbelina hummed a little tune in happiness. Sitting in silence for a few minutes, Cornelius started to rub his hand on Thumbelina's arm. In response, Thumbelina nuzzled her head into her beloved's neck. Grabbing hold of her chin with the hand on her waist, Cornelius lifted her head, and started leaning in. Thumbelina did the same. Their eyes drifted shut, their breath mingled, and their hearts pounded in their chests, until... Their lips touched in a kiss. ~0~ Thumbelina was still smiling as they left the festival. Never in her wildest dream did she ever hope for a relationship with anyone. Sure, she wished to have a love and a happily ever after. But her size was always on the forefront of her mind, and never previously knowing that there were others the same size as she, she lamented never being able to have a partner in life. She always assumed it was impossible. When Cornelius showed up on her windowsill, and her fright at seeing a stranger inside her room passed, Thumbelina could not believe her luck. Here was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and suddenly her dream of love and happiness no longer seemed so impossible. No longer was she unhappy and upset over the unfairness of her size. Instead, she looked forward to the coming of each day as it brought with it Cornelius' arrival. Arriving at her home, Thumbelina was glad to see that her mother wasn't waiting for her in her room, meaning that Hero had succeeded in distracted the elder woman successfully. Not having her around for the moment meant that she could spend a few extra minutes with her beloved. Feeling Cornelius grab onto her waist, Thumbelina leaned over to help aid him. Once down, she threw her arms around his neck and nuzzled his neck, sighing his name in happiness. \"I had the best time of my life.\" Hugging her back tightly, Cornelius replied, \"I'm glad, Thumbelina.\" He kissed her forehead. \"You have no idea how happy I am right now.\" In a spur of excitement, he twisted Thumbelina around so her back was to his chest, nuzzled her neck, peppered her with kisses, and swayed to a song only they could hear. Thumbelina giggled. Turning her head, she found Cornelius' lips and pecked him. In a burst of playfulness, she flittered out of his reach when he leaned in for a longer kiss. \"Wha-Why? Get back here!\" Thumbelina laughed at him. What followed was a game of cat and mouse, with Thumbelina in the role of mouse. If anyone from the town was to walk close enough they would hear the squeals of a female, the grunts of a male, and the buzzing of a protesting bumblebee. If they were to look up they would notice the tiny girl successfully dodging the advancing fairy, occasionally hiding behind the large bumble and using it as a shield. They would notice when the fairy trapped his companion against the wall and how the girl ducked when he leaned in. And they would also notice when the fairy changed tactics and unfairly tackled the girl and flew her into the air. \"Cornelius! That's not fair. I can't fly like you can.\" Thumbelina gasped in false indignation. Cornelius wiggled his eyebrows. \"You shouldn't have run away, Thumbelina. Now hold still and let me kiss you.\" he said, taking her lips in a deep kiss as they drifted down to the floor. She sighed. Their kiss was interrupted a few seconds later when Buzzby pushed against Cornelius' legs with a buzz. Cornelius grunted as he steadied Thumbelina from falling. \"What did you do that for, boy?\" He frowned when Buzzby buzzed in urgency. \"What is the matter?\" Thumbelina asked worried. Cornelius sighed in frustration. \"I have to go. But I'll see you tomorrow, okay?\" Thumbelina pouted in disappointment. \"Come back soon.\" Pecking her lips, Cornelius turned to hop on an awaiting Buzzby, \"Good night, Thumbelina.\" \"Good night, Cornelius,\" Thumbelina cried back as her love took off. ~0~ The next time Cornelius came to Thumbelina's house, he came with a grumpy disposition. \"What's the matter, Cornelius?\" Thumbelina asked. Walking briskly up to her, Cornelius gathered her in his arms and planted a deep kiss on her lips. Thumbelina gasped and pulled back slightly in surprise, but feeling Cornelius follow with his lips she gave in and kissed back eagerly. The need for air pulled them apart. Licking his lips, Cornelius answered, \"I'm sorry, Thumbelina. But I won't be able to see you for a week.\" Thumbelina grew worried. \"What? Why? What's wrong?\" Seeing her worry, Cornelius placed a hand on her cheek. His thumb rubbed the underside of her eye. \"Nothing's wrong, Thumbelina. It's just-My mother told me we would be leaving on a…business trip soon.\" He dropped his head on her shoulder. \"I won't be able to see you for a week.\" Thumbelina un-furrowed her eyebrows a little at that. \"Oh...uh, well. A week isn't too bad.\" Cornelius grimaced. \"It is when it's just another stupid meeting with more stuffy old men than I ever want to see in my whole life!\" he suddenly growled as he pushed himself away from her. \"Why can't my mother just let me enjoy my youth! I have the rest of my life to learn all the rules and responsibilities of the mona-business!\" Cornelius quickly interjected the last word, taking a peek at Thumbelina's face. He hadn't meant to almost reveal what he really was in the world of the fairies. Thankfully Thumbelina didn't catch his almost slip as she grabbed his shoulder in support. \"Have you talked to her about that?\" she asked. \"Of course I have!\" Cornelius yelled and jumped away to face her. \"But she doesn't listen to me at all! It's all 'You must keep tradition going!', 'What will the Court think?', 'Cornelius, my son, why must you fight what's been in the family for centuries?' I'm not fighting tradition! I just want to live my life before I'm tied down for the rest of my life!\" He sighed out in frustration as he slumped onto a nearby thimble. Seeking to comfort him, Thumbelina wrapped her arms around her love. She rubbed his back and laid her head on his. She smiled when he reciprocated the embrace. \"What of your father? Have you talked to him?\" \"Yes.\" Cornelius sighed. \"He's not much help. He just tries to keep the peace between us without picking a side.\" He groaned in frustration as he furrowed his head into her stomach. Not knowing enough about the situation, Thumbelina had no clue how to comfort her beloved. Cornelius had told her about his relationship with his mother before, and from what Thumbelina could tell from only hearing one side of the story, she knew his mother loved and worried over her son very much. It seemed, to her, that what the woman most worried about was her son's future. She couldn't recall exactly how many times Cornelius had mentioned an argument between his mother and him, but she did recall that almost all had to do with his future, even if it seemed like she worried more over what society thought of him than her son's wishes. After all, one of the most important things to a mother was seeing her child(ren) settled and happy once they flew the nest. Thumbelina knew her own mother thought the same. Rubbing his back some more, and occasionally passing her hand through his hair, Thumbelina waited for Cornelius to settle his thoughts for the moment. She didn't need to wait long as only a few minutes later Cornelius pulled back to look at her with apologetic eyes. \"I'm sorry Thumbelina. Our last night before I'm gone for a week and here I am wasting it.\" Running her hand down his cheek, she replied, \"You're not wasting anything, Cornelius. I'm happy you feel that you can talk to me.\" He reached to grab the hand on his cheek. \"Oh, Thumbelina... these days I think you're the only one that I can really talk to about anything.\" Hearing a buzz, Cornelius amended, \"Of course, you're a great listener too, Buzzby.\" Thumbelina giggled. Cornelius' lips twitched at the sound. With the recent argument in his head still Cornelius looked upon Thumbelina with thoughtful eyes. While the argument had been over his recent neglect of his responsibilities, one thing he had deliberately failed to mention to Thumbelina was that his mother had also mentioned his continual 'bachelor' status. He had never told his parents of his newfound relationship, not for shame of Thumbelina not being a fairy or of the Court, but from a need to keep this part of his life untouched by his mother's worrisome and slightly controlling ways. But looking at his beautiful Thumbelina now, Cornelius imagined having his girl next to him once he took the throne. It wouldn't be the first time he thought of making Thumbelina his princess. The past few months have been the best of his life and he couldn't imagine a day in which Thumbelina wouldn't be there to kiss him goodnight. But would she be happy becoming royalty? Not only has he withheld such vital information as him being the crown prince of the fairies, but Cornelius knew that the life of a royal came with vast responsibilities, endless spoken and unspoken rules, and a distinct lack of privacy. He also knew how much she would miss her Mother. As this thought passed through his mind, Cornelius tactfully asked, \"Thumbelina? Do you plan on living with your Mother the rest of your life?\" Thumbelina frowned. \"Why would you ask that?\" Plowing on Cornelius continued with, \"If I asked you to live with me in the Vale of the Fairies, would you go?\" Thumbelina took a step back in surprise. \"What-Cornelius? What are you saying?\" Pulling her back to him, Cornelius said, \"I'm not asking you to come with me now but if in the future... would you leave your mother to be with me?\" Looking down at the floor, Thumbelina's mouth opened and closed as she tried to come up with a response. \"Leave Mother? I-I-I never thought of leaving her before. I mean, I'm the only one she has besides the farm animals and Hero.\" She looked into Cornelius' eyes. \"What brought this on so suddenly?\" \"It is not sudden, Thumbelina. I've been thinking about it for a while. You have no idea how difficult it is to leave you every night, to kiss you goodbye.\" He pulled her hand to his chest. \"Please, Thumbelina. I don't want to only see you a few hours every day.\" Shaking her head, Thumbelina answered, \"But Cornelius! I'm not even a fairy! How can I live in the Vale of the Fairies with you? How would that work?\" \"You not being a fairy makes no difference.\" Cornelius chimed in. Thumbelina threw her arms up. \"Yes, it does, Cornelius! I'm not like you. I have no wings, no dust, no powers. I don't even know how to maintain a house very well. Mother had to take over with everything being so big!\" \"That doesn't matter to me, Thumbelina.\" \"It does to me, Cornelius.\" She turned to look at him. \"What would your fairy friends think of me? A wingless thumb-sized human? No. What would your parents think of me?! I'm probably what they least suspect-\" Thumbelina stopped as Cornelius jumped in front of her. She hadn't realized she was pacing. \"What if I were your wings?\" Cornelius asked excitedly. Thumbelina blinked. \"What?\" Grabbing her hand, Cornelius pulled her towards Buzzby. \"Come on! Let's go.\" Practically throwing her onto Buzzby, Cornelius was quick to take flight. \"Hold on tight.\" he said, looking back at her. And grabbing hold of Buzzby's antennae, Cornelius urged his bumble to speed off into the meadows. Complying, Buzzby took off as fast as he could. \"Whoa!\" Feeling the wind smack into her face, Thumbelina's worry was pushed into the back of her mind and she laughed. And of course, hearing her laugh had Cornelius laughing. \"Let me be your wings Let me be your only love... Seeing three jitterbugs ahead of him carrying a flower necklace, Cornelius leaned forward as they flew to drop the arrangement over Thumbelina's head. And directing Buzzby to fly over a creek, he leaned back to drape an arm around Thumbelina's waist when he felt her shift to the right. Let me take you far beyond the stars... Thumbelina smiled as she watched the water part under her finger. When she sat up, Cornelius had Buzzby land in the very same water. Lifting off of his ride, Cornelius turned to grab hold of Thumbelina and began to dance with her over the surface of the stream. Let me be your wings Let me lift you high above Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours... A swan flew by them and getting an idea, Cornelius flew with Thumbelina to land on the swan's head. Anything that you desire Anything at all Every day I'll take you higher And I'll never let you fall... Cornelius took off when he felt the swan settle into the water. Spotting next a golden pumpkin growing in a field, Cornelius flew in that direction as he continued: Let me be your wings Leave behind the world you know For another world of wondrous things We'll see the universe And dance on Saturn's rings Fly with me, and I will be your wings. They left behind the floating pumpkin to fly over a meadow. They were too entranced in each other to notice two jitterbugs - a mother and son pair - gazing at them. Nor did they hear as the son asked his mom, \"She's gonna marry the fairy prince, huh, Mama?\" to which she responded, \"Well, perhaps.\" They didn't even notice when they flew through a dandelion. \"Anything that you desire Anything at all... Thumbelina, entranced, joined in the song with, \" Anything at all\" , as Cornelius twirled her away and back into his arms. Every day I'll take you higher And I'll never let you fall... In a complete show of faith, Thumbelina purposefully let go of his shoulders when she felt him remove his hands to gesture. Showing no fear as she free-fell through the air, Thumbelina continued to sing. You will be my wings... Cornelius was quick to dip and catch his love bridal style before she fell too far. Let me be your wings (You will be my only love) Get ready for another world of wondrous things (Wondrous things are sure to happen) They flew over to a floating boat in a nearby pond. We'll see the universe And dance on Saturn's rings... Cornelius turned Thumbelina around to sit on the boat's edge. Heaven isn't too far (Heaven is where you are) Knowing that at least one of the boat's inhabitants was watching their display, Thumbelina blew a kiss to the toad. Cornelius rolled his eyes at her action, before lifting her up on her feet again. Stay with me And let me be your wings\" Flying off with her in his arms, Cornelius lifted his love further above him as she threw back her arms and enjoyed the feeling of wind on her face. They wouldn't know how much trouble Thumbelina's simple action would cause for the both of them later on as two toads spoke beneath them. ~0~ Minutes before the lovely couple made their appearance around the pond in which they lived, Mrs. Toad and Grundel were speaking once again of Grundel's mischievous older brothers. For what had to be the hundredth time, Grundel had brought Mama outside to complain of how his brothers were mocking his dance moves and hoped that his Mama would interfere with his brothers' teasing. \"How many times must I tell you, hijo , to stand up for yourself?\" Mrs. Toad hissed. She was tired of hearing her youngest hijo to complain like a little niño to her. He was old enough to solve his own problems. Grundel threw out his arms. \"But Mama...\" \" Pero nada, niño . I won't help you. You need to fight your own batallas . You hear me.\" Staring her son down, Mrs. Toad waited until he sighed and nodded his head before walking away. She didn't walk far when she heard two voices harmonizing outside her door. One of them sounded suspiciously like a certain fairy prince, who was known across the vale to have a magnificent singing voice. But that wasn't what caught her attention. No, it was the voice that accompanied the prince's that had her walking briskly out to her patio/stage again. Stepping up next to her son just as the couple lifted up into the air, Mrs. Toad commented \" Ay, pero que voz mas bonita. Her voice is fantastica .\" in awe. Her hijo sighed. \"Mama, I love her.\" Is that so? , Mrs. Toad thought. Well, it seems their act would be having a new chiquita as a member. ~0~ Quickly locating Buzzby again, Cornelius flew his beloved back to her home. Something had shifted between them, he felt, and he couldn't have been happier with the result. Singing to Thumbelina had been a spur of the moment idea but it was the best idea he has had yet. Everything he sang to her was -is - true and he hoped he brought her some reassurance because he now knew that he definitely wanted Thumbelina around for the rest of his life. Particularly as his wife. Landing on her by now very familiar windowsill, Cornelius whirled Thumbelina in a circle bridal style. \"Oh, Thumbelina.\" he sighed. \"Something-Oh.\" He turned in excitement. \"Something happened to me tonight. Something-something I never want to forget.\" Thumbelina smiled. \"Me too,\" she said softly. Remembering the flower she acquired during their flight, Thumbelina reached to take it off. Incidentally, the flowers were forget-me-nots. They were perfect for what she said next. \"Do not forget me,\" she said, not forgetting how he was to leave her alone for the following week. Cornelius lowered his head so Thumbelina could place the necklace around his neck. He also didn't miss the type of flower it was made of. \"Forget-me-nots.\" he breathed. Wanting to give her something in return, Cornelius removed the ring on his finger, which symbolized his royal status. Having noticed that Thumbelina neither knew nor recognized what the ring represented he hadn't bothered removing it. He was glad he hadn't. \"Oh, I'll never forget you. Never.\" he continued and cheekily slipped the ring onto Thumbelina's left ring finger, knowing what such an action meant to humans. Also not failing to notice his actions, Thumbelina grew giddy inside. \"Never. Never.\" she whispered, leaning in for a kiss. \"Cornelius!\" cried a woman in the distance. In annoyance, Cornelius replied \"Oh, Mother.\" automatically before pausing as he turned back to Thumbelina. \"What-Mother?\" What was she doing here?! , he thought frantically as he fluttered his wings in agitation. He pulled Thumbelina inside away from sight as the voice registered in his mind. \"Cornelius! Come now!\" was heard from the same source. Cornelius grew more panicked when Thumbelina obviously not having missed his reaction to the voice, asked \"Cornelius, who are those people?\" Pushing an also panicking Buzzby out the window, as there was no time to move the gigantic window frame at the moment, Cornelius was quick to shush her. \"Shh! There's no time to explain. That's the queen of the fairies.\" He rolled his eyes in annoyance. And hoping to show her the urgency of the matter, he continued with \"My mother.\" Not fully registering the comment yet, Thumbelina asked, \"Your mother?\" Cornelius tried and failed to stamp his worry over his parents finding his secret getaway spot - and his secret love - down as he said, \"Yeah. Look, I must go now, but, well... I'll see you in a week, alright?\" Thumbelina, however, was still reeling over what has just been revealed to her. \"Wha-Your mother?\" She pulled away to hold her head. \"Uh, then you're the... you are-are the-\" Not able to register the newfound information quite yet, Thumbelina decided to turn her attention to the second matter at hand. \"Wait. You're leaving already?\" \"Yes, I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting for my mother to find me here.\" And not failing to notice her inability to comprehend his earlier statement, he pulled her down to him again and clarified, \"Yes, I'm the prince.\" He smiled a half smile, sheepishly. \"The prince?\" Thumbelina breathed out. \"Yeah,\" he said. And knowing the gig was up, as well as hoping to make her part of the family one day, Cornelius said, \"Look. Will you meet my parents?\" He looked imploringly into her face. \"Cornelius!\" came from outside again, closer than before. Feeling the sense of urgency, especially as Buzzby was plainly visible outside, Cornelius begged, \"Oh, say you will.\" \"I-\" Thumbelina started, only having to think for a moment. \"I will.\" She said determined. She didn't need to think too long on something that she had fantasized about before already. \"You will?\" Cornelius asked in happy surprise. He thought she would at least take longer to reply. \"I will.\" Thumbelina said again. Already fantasizing about what to wear when meeting her love's parents, Thumbelina giggled in excitement. \"I will, Prince Cornelius, yes!\" Well, I guess I needn't have worried over her reaction so much , Cornelius thought as Thumbelina threw her arms around him. Initially accepting her hug, Cornelius struggled to unwind her arms when she didn't let go immediately. \"Cornelius!\" cried his mother again. \"Cornelius!\" joined in another voice. His father was here too?! Shrugging off his love's arms quickly, Cornelius whispered frantically, \"I-I've got to go.\" He turned at Thumbelina's inquiry of \"Will they like me?\" and grimaced when he noticed her looking out the window. \"Shh! Get down! Yes. Yes, they'll love you.\" he said, but realizing how his actions might make her think that he was trying to hide her from shame - which he wasn't, as he hoped he showed her with his song earlier - he continued, \"But, uh, let me talk to them first tonight. Alright? And when I return, I'll take you to meet them, okay?\" Thumbelina smiled. \"And then you can meet my mother.\" Having heard so many storied of the woman, Cornelius was happy to do so. \"Well, great, but... well, wait here.\" He grabbed her hands. Knowing from various stories how meeting the parents signified a great step into creating an everlasting relationship, Thumbelina happily sighed, \"And then we'll live happily ever after.\" Cornelius gladly interjected with, \"Oh, much longer.\" He leaned in to seal the deal. \"Cornelius!\" yelled his father this time. Said male groaned in frustration. \"Oh! Good-Goodbye!\" He pecked her lips and ran out. Thumbelina followed him. \"You won't forget to come back, will you?\" \"I promise.\" he said, leaning in for his goodnight kiss. He never got it as Buzzby flew off when he couldn't hold his fear back anymore. Thumbelina continued to wave goodbye until even Cornelius' bright fairy dust could no longer be seen by her human eyes. \"Oh, Cornelius...\" she sighed and hummed in pleasure. ~0~ A few minutes later, Cornelius could be found following behind his parent's chariot. They really had been close to finding out where he went to every night. He had picked up on their trail of fairy dust just as they reached the gates of the human town. Any longer and they might have spotted his bumble resting on one of the closest houses. \"Cornelius!\" yelled his mother again. \"Yes, Mother?\" he asked, grinning inside at the jump his mother did. She turned upset eyes at him. \"Cornelius, my sunshine, where have you been?! Do you know how worried we were?! And what are you doing on that wretched bumblebee again? You could've been hurt! What have you been doing?\" Cornelius opened his mouth to answer, but Tabitha held her hand up. \"Nope! Never mind, tell me when we get home. It's late, young man. We shouldn't even be out here. What were you thinking?!\" \"Tabitha...\" \"Let's go, Colbert. Cornelius, we'll talk about this at home. First, we have business to attend to.\" Colbert sighed as he flicked the reigns in his hand. Cornelius stayed right next to them, not wanting to risk more of his mother's wrath. And he stayed right next to them as they conducted last minute business before they all left for business with the fairy monarchs of the south. But in retrospect, he probably should've spoken with his parents about his 'bachelor' status before he announced to the entire fairy court that he had found the girl of his dreams and planned to ask her to marry him when they returned from the trip. Standing in his parents designated 'flower bedroom', Cornelius scowled as his mother ranted about how she should've known he would find all kinds of trouble out by his lonesome. \"Thumbelina is not trouble, Mother. She's the love of my life and my future princess!\" \"How could she be the future princess? We haven't even met her!\" Tabitha shouted. \"I certainly don't know of any fairy girl named 'Thumbelina'!\" Cornelius shifted his weight from foot to foot. \"Ahh... Thumbelina isn't a fairy, Mother. She's human.\" His parents gasped. \"A human?!\" his mother screeched. \"What do you mean, son? How did you fall for a human?\" inquired his father, shocked at the new development. The surprises just didn't stop coming. Cornelius grinned at the thought of his love, and both his parents glanced at each other upon witnessing his eyes sparkle. \"Well, you see, she's no ordinary human. She's our size. Smaller than me, actually! If she wasn't missing wings, I would swear she was a fairy who lost her way!\" Cornelius commented, excitedly. \"Wha-How can that be? That's impossible!\" Tabitha exclaimed. \"Oh, but it is, Mother. She's who I've been seeing every night since the golding of the leaves. She's amazing! You'll love her, Mom. I know it!\" Cornelius grinned at her. Surprised at hearing him call her \"Mom\" as he hadn't done since he was a child, Tabitha paused before she unleashed exactly what she thought of this mysterious maiden. Was this girl really so extraordinary as to capture the attention of her wayward son? She knew how hard it was to keep his attention for long, as can be witnessed by his continual escapes from royal responsibility and his countless unfinished lessons. The sword on his hip - which she knew he didn't much know how to use - being one of them. She sighed. \"Cornelius, dear, before you go ahead and ask this girl to be part of the royal family I want to meet her.\" She was skeptical but she'll give this girl a chance. Cornelius jumped and gestured excitedly with his arms. \"Well, that's perfect! I told her she could come meet you the day after we return. I'll even get to meet her mother!\" He turned in one place. His parents were surprised at this. They hadn't expected for the two to already have planned their meeting. \"Does she know who you are, Cornelius?\" Looking at his father sheepishly, Cornelius answered, \"Uh, yeah. I told her tonight. She kind of heard you two calling for me.\" \"Do you mean to tell me you heard us calling for you? You had me worried for nothing?!\" Tabitha was quick to interject. Cornelius rubbed the back of his neck. \"Sorry, Mother.\" \"Tabitha, dear...\" Colbert trailed off. \"What? He had me worried sick! Who knows what could have happened to him when we didn't know where in heaven's sake he was!\" Tabitha started and Cornelius had to sit through another long lecture about safety and propriety feeling as if he was a kid again. But his safety while on his escapades would be the least of their problems as trouble brood in a pond nearby. ~0~ Exactly one week later, on the eve of Cornelius' arrival at Thumbelina's home once again, a female toad hopped to the front yard of a certain human home. Mrs. Toad had had a particular stressful week. Not only did most inhabitants of the Vale have no clue as to who the girl was - let alone where she lived - but rumors of the girl's impending engagement to the fairy prince was running amok. And worse, some were even calling the girl their fairy princess as if she was already married to the boy! Mrs. Toad had to work fast, but as time passed and no information could be gathered on this mysterious girl, Mrs. Toad became more frantic to find the niña who could make her big in show business. She could not let talent like hers get away! But as luck would have it, on that very same day she spotted the girl amongst some captivated animals in the backyard of a human's house. Ay, que suerte tuvo ella! And now here she sat, in the dark, gazing up at the lit window as she waited for the niña's madre to leave her alone for the night. She didn't wait long before the lights were blown out and all sound seized. Waiting for a few more minutes just to be sure, Mrs. Toad began her trek up to the second floor window. She was ecstatic to note the opened window. Probably to let the silly fairy boy in if he came , she thought. Spotting a small bed made from a nut not far away, Mrs. Toad only paused long enough to make sure the niña was inside before she slammed the bed closed. \"Gotcha!\" she cried in success. She failed to notice the dog sleeping not too far away. She knew she got the right niña when she heard la voz fantastica say, \"Oh. What?\" from inside. Tuning her cries out of her immediate attention, Mrs. Toad focused on carrying the rather heavy bed over to the window and getting it through the crack. Suddenly hearing a growl and having the window slam shut on her, Mrs. Toad looked up and cried, \"Oh! A dog!\" It growled at her some more and barked. In terror, Mrs. Toad jumped away with her prize. \"Ay! Get away from me!\" Speeding away from the dog as quick as possible, Mrs. Toad paid no mind to the now suspiciously silent girl in the nut in her hands. Eventually getting to the window, which opened under the force of Mrs. Toad's jump, the mother of three boys was quick to jump down to the river close by. It would take her directly to the pond on which her home was temporarily planted. She watched in fear and anxiety at the approaching dog in the sky and barely got through an opening in the town's gate. When the river took her far out of the dog's reach, Mrs. Toad took off her mask and waved goodbye at the dog with it, victorious. ~0~ Getting close enough to her home through ways of the river, Mrs. Toad made quick strokes to her home with her new member close at hand. Grundel waited for her on the porch/stage. \"Did you find her, Mama? Is that her?\" \" Si , mi hijo . Had to fight dog for her but as ever, your mama gets what she wants.\" she said as she jumped onto her home and set the bed on one side of the stage. \"Can I see her? Can I see her?\" Grundel jumped from leg to leg much as a human child might when their parent mentions there being a new pet in the box they held. In response, Mrs. Toad opened up the top half of the bed to reveal an unconscious tiny human girl within. Mrs. Toad tsk-ed at this. \"Must have been all the jumping.\" she murmured. Grundel looked on with his hands pulling on his lips and his tongue hanging out. \"Well,\" Mrs. Toad clapped, \"off to bed. We can't put on good show if we sleep on our feet.\" She grabbed at Grundel's shirt and dragged him off when he made no move to do so. ~0~ The next morning proved to be a devastating one to the mother of the tiny girl in the nut bed. Thumbelina's mother had woken up much as she did on any other day. She woke up just as the sun hit the horizon and set out to dress herself so she may cook breakfast as always. Poor Thumbelina had tried to help her out once but her tiny size didn't allow her much movement with the kitchen utensils. Ever since, Thumbelina's mother made sure to have breakfast made before her daughter woke up as to not make her feel bad for her size. Once she had the ingredients for a stew set out, Thumbelina's mother went outside to collect some firewood to heat the stove later on. As she approached the stacked pieces of firewood next on the side of her home, she paused when she heard what sounded like a familiar whine coming from a little further away. She turned toward the sound, and wanting to help the creature, walked briskly toward the river. She gasped when she discovered it was Hero making the noise. \"Hero? Hero, what are you doing here? Where's Thumbelina?\" She wondered if her daughter had woken up earlier than usual. Hero let out a louder whine at her last question and sniffed once more at the opening he was situated in front of. He turned to his owner and barking raced back to her home to show her. Starting to feel dread well up in her chest, Thumbelina's mother raced behind the dog as fast as she could and gasped when she reached her daughter's room. It was trashed. No doubt because Hero gave the intruder a tussle. How could she not have heard anything? \"Thumbelina?\" she cried out in fear. \"Thumbelina? Thumbelina, please, answer me!\" She felt tears well up her eyes as she continued to call out to her daughter and rummaged through the overturned furniture. When she thoroughly scored the room, Thumbelina's mother turned her attention to the rest of the house until all the rooms had been checked as she arrived back at the kitchen. Practically falling into the only chair in the room, Thumbelina's mother began to sob. Hero left the room in shame. ~0~ At the same time Thumbelina's mother found out of her daughter's kidnapping, a certain fairy prince made his way eagerly back to his beloved's home, wearing a helmet his mother insisted on him wearing. He bore gifts he acquired for her while on his trip to the south. \"Thumbelina!\" His quick jump off of bumble cause him to drop all the gifts in his hands. \"Ooh!\" Unflustered, Cornelius chuckled and called out, \"Thumbelina. Thumbelina!\" as he popped the tight helmet off his head. \"Oops.\" he sighed. \"Got it.\" Putting the helmet under his arm, Cornelius wondered why his love hasn't come crying his name happily yet. \"Thumbelina, it's me. Where are you?\" He looked around and finally spotted the disaster that was his Thumbelina's room. He gasped, horrified. And much as Thumbelina's mother had done earlier, Cornelius searched the room for his girl before hearing whimpering from the corner of the room. Spotting Hero, he flew right over and stood on the dog's nose. The dog opened his eyes at feeling a foreign weight on his nose and began barking at his charges' nightly visitor. Cornelius was unprepared to be tossed into the air by the dog's enthusiastic greeting. Cornelius chuckled slightly. Knowing that Hero would know, Cornelius asked, \"where is she?\" Hero whimpered. She's gone. \"What? What happened?\" Cornelius was surprised at this news. A growl. Stolen away ... window . Cornelius flew away in more surprise and with impending dread in his stomach.\"She was stolen away? Wha-Out the window?\" Hero woofed, happy the fairy comprehended what he said. Growing angry, Cornelius demanded, \"Who did it?\" Hero whimpered and half growled, half murmured a response which took a moment for the prince to comprehend. He snapped his fingers once he got it. \"A toad?\" He dropped his head in his hands, remembering the toad pond he took Thumbelina to last week on their latest flight together. Was this his fault? he wondered. Hero continued to bark at the flying boy. Cornelius murmured a brief, \"good dog\" before flying over to an awaiting bumblebee. He dragged his sword out in anger and flicked it as he made a promise to Hero. \"I'll find her.\" Hero ran after him wanting to help. Cornelius turned to the determined dog. \"No, no, Hero. Look, you stay here and take care of Thumbelina's mother. Let her know everything will be all right.\" He took off toward his home. Hero whimpered as Thumbelina's only hope flew away. ~0~ Not too far away from the scene of the crime, said girl in question was just coming to full wakefulness as the morning sun's rays hit her eyes. She groaned at feeling a pounding headache and raised a hand to her head. She frowned when she felt a bump on the side of her head that was thankfully not bleeding. When the smell of pond water invaded her nose, Thumbelina opened her eyes only to shut them at the brightness. \"Oh, mmm.\" Trying again but slowly this time, Thumbelina gasped at seeing clear blue waters in front of her, covered with lily pads and surrounded with giant green grass. She jumped when she heard a strongly accented voice next to her. \" Buenos dias . I hope you sleep very, very good.\" Mrs. Toad cheered. Turning, and holding up her bedspread as if it could shield her, Thumbelina cried, \"Huh? Uh, w-who are you?\" Shrugging off her pink rode to reveal a green spotted dress underneath, Mrs. Toad answered with, \" Nosotros ? We are the very happy family Singers de España . These are my sons Mozo, Gringo, and Grundel.\" The former of the two jumped in with smiles on their faces but the latter had to be made to smile. \"We are very rich and famous.\" She danced a little. \"Rich and famous?\" Thumbelina repeated dumbly, still wondering what was going on. \"Si. Si, mucho.\" Mrs. Toad said with pride. \"I bring you here to become famous singer like me.\" She wiggled her fingers over her head. Initially imitating her move to try to understand what she spoke about, Thumbelina grew surprised when what she said sunk in. \"Oh, goodbye.\" She had no desire to make a living by singing. \"Uh, my mother will be very worried.\" She cried out when the three sons blocked her path. She missed the lovesick look the youngest one gave her. \"Mama, no worry. Mama proud.\" Mrs. Toad reassured. \"When you are a star, she make big fiesta, and invite all the neighbors to come see her little niña who have become big, big, very big.\" Honing in on the last word Mrs. Toad said, Thumbelina asked, \"Big?\" momentarily forgetting about Cornelius as she heard something she wanted for years. Standing up on her head and spreading her arms Thumbelina excitedly asked, \"Oh, you mean big?\" Her grin fell when Mrs. Toad corrected her. \"I mean important and loved by everyone.\" Now remembering about Cornelius, Thumbelina commented, \"But, uh, Cornelius loves me already.\" She shimmied to the edge of the bed. \"I think I'm gonna marry him.\" She only added the first part as Cornelius hadn't asked for her hand yet. She had no idea most of the Vale already thought of her as his fiancé after she announcement he made a week prior. \"Marry him?\" Mrs. Toad asked in disgust. \" Ay, chihuahua . That will be a very big mistake.\" she said, remembering how she almost lost her starlight at the hands of her late husband. \"It will get in the way of your career in show business, while doing all the time those things domesticos. \" \"What things?\" What was 'domesticos'? \"The scrubbings and the washing And the noses with the drippings And the sopas always boiling\" Her three sons nodded their head in agreement. \"Si, Si\" \"The panes and windows falling With the diapers changing With the rood, she's leaking And the enchiladas spoiling... The boys groaned dramatically. Do you know how to do these things Like you will have to do these things Or does the very thought of it make you wince?\" Thumbelina grimaced at hearing all the work she knew she would not be able to do with her tiny size. The boys chimed in with an \"Uh.\" of disgust. \"I thought so.\" Mrs. Toad said, not knowing the real reason Thumbelina grimaced. \"Then don't marry the prince... Still not knowing what exactly she got herself into, Thumbelina breathed \"Oh, dear\" in worry. She looked at the fast moving hips of the female toad wondering how she was able to do that. \"You see, hey? You become a big a-star like me. We make big moneys together. You make Mama rich. You're important person. You are famous. You are a star.\" Giving up her imitation of Mrs. Toad, Thumbelina moved to the edge of the boat home. \"A star?\" Would Cornelius not mind her being a star? \"Well, I suppose.\" \"Now, repeat after me.\" \"We are the Singer de España , the original cast And there hasn't been a town we haven't played in (We are the Singers de España And we sing very fast We get on We get off We get paid) \"Sing!\" Mrs. Toad demanded. \"Could you say that a little slower?\" Thumbelina begged, unable to keep up with the foreign music, foreign words, and fast tempo. Mrs. Toad wrinkled her nose. \"Slower? We don't do ballads.\" \"Oh, maybe I could take notes.\" \"We are free and independent We go everywhere And we goochee goochee goochee all the way We're going to teach you how to samba And to rumba y la bamba And every number Thumbelina say ole! The audience they accumulated cheered. \"Come on the road, my little castanet Come on the road And famous you will get I'll make you star Get your small guitar You'll be hot muchacha once I gotcha On the Road Thumbelina started to grow annoyed with the toads pushing her every which way. Backing away from Mrs. Toad, she didn't notice when her three sons showed up behind her until she turned to get away and saw them conga lining toward her. She backed away from them swiftly. \"Thumbelinacita No one could be sweet-a Sing with mamacita We go on the road, uh! Thumbelina found herself jumping back onto the lily pad she escaped from when she could not back away any more. The lily pad rocked under her feet, and fearing a fall into the water she jumped onto the next one, effectively placing her front and center to the musical going on around her. She tried not to cringe at the high pitched... something that Mrs. Toad let out. \" Ay, yi yi yi yi. Ay, pero que bien bailan mis ranitos la conga !\" Thumbelina pulled at the hand that grabbed her arm. She wished these toads would stop manhandling her. Unfortunately, Mrs. Toad was behind her again. \"We open Monday in Medina Then we do Babylon Then we hop to Barcelona for a week Then for a month in Athens At the Parthenon Where they love us cause we do the show in Greek Thumbelina almost fell over when the three boys hopped onto her lily pad to dance. \"We are the finest in the business It's a well-known fact And you'll forgive us if we have to blow the horn They turned to grab at Thumbelina's legs. And Thumbelina couldn't hide the fact that being pushed into the air was exciting. It reminded her of how Cornelius would sometimes lift her higher than himself so she could feel like she was flying. \"Cause this isn't any ordinary animal act And today a star is born! The toads jumped away again. \"Go on the road You'll hear the peoples roar You're not a toad (But that's what makeup's for) Just sing on pitch We get very rich Grundel rubbed his hands together seeing Thumbelina seize her struggle to get away. He knew that lift earlier was a good idea. Never mind that his brother, Mozo, was the one to think of it. \"Wait until they see the Thumbelina (On the road) But just because Thumbelina seized her struggle to leave, that didn't mean she wanted any part in the ordeal. She refused the behest of Mrs. Toad to start singing and dancing. She shook her head vigorously at all the toad's prompting. \"Singing Thumbelina Dancing Thumbelina Something Thumbelina Growing tired with the niña's refusal, Mrs. Toad sang, \" Now I make her sing .\" Thumbelina didn't expect the sudden pain in her foot. She cried out in pain and decided to join in in fear that Mrs. Toad would do something similar. Satisfied with the result, Mrs. Toad kissed herself. \" Bueno. Muy bueno . You got it.\" \"Come on the road We make you big success Come on the road (You're in the union, yes?) The life, she's sweet Lot's of flies to eat Thumbelina gagged at witnessing firsthand a toad catch and eat a fly raw. \"Yum. Yum.\" Mrs. Toad went and pushed her back into the boys. Thumbelina stayed still in hopes that they wouldn't drop her and raised her arm to hide her nervousness. \"So why be little fish in little pond When you can go so far beyond (I think perhaps we make you blonde) When we get on the road Thumbelina's heart almost jumped out of her chest when she was thrown onto the lily pad. \"Ay yi yi yi yi!\" Even Thumbelina had no clue why she joined in with: \"On the road... The toad family weren't complaining as they harmonized: \"Let's hit the road... \"Ole!\" they yelled, posing at the end and making their audience cheer is appreciation. Hearing the applause, cheers, and seeing the money they made Thumbelina grinned and seriously wondered for a moment whether a career in show business was the way to go. She bowed under their praise. From behind her Grundel told his mama, \"Mama, you'll give her to me. I will marry her.\" Not seeing a problem with that, Mrs. Toad answered with, \"Very well. You can marry la niña . We can keep the money she earns in the family.\" She turned when la nina ran up to her. \"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Toad. Thank you.\" Thumbelina couldn't help but say. Never before had she been so readily accepted by anyone outside of her family and Cornelius. Being a creature that didn't much belong to any species, as she was a thumb-sized human without any wings, she wasn't one to have many people look at her and actually talk to her like they would anybody else. Here and now she had other beings actually praising and applauding her. She felt like she had worth. \"They really like me.\" Glancing around once more, she asked, \"Am I a star?\" \"Yes, and you can call me Mama.\" \"Mama?\" Thumbelina frowned. Why would she do that? \"You are going to marry my son Grundel.\" What?! \"I-what?\" Thumbelina was stupefied and looked at the toad in question. She grimaced at the look the boy had on his face. \"I love Thumbelina.\" Grundel sighed. \"You wait right here, Thumbelina chiquitita . We'll be right back with the padre.\" When did she say yes to this?! \"Oh, no, no, no. See, I love Cornelius.\" Unhindered Mrs. Toad continued, \"Today you marry my son.\" \"Oh no, no, no. No, I'm not marrying-no, come back here. Now, now wait a second, w-where are you going?\" Thumbelina grew desperate as she cried out to leaving toads. When they were no more than a speck on the horizon, Thumbelina looked around and saw that she had been left alone, and frustrated and fearful she called, \"Doesn't anybody care what I think?\" She fell over, unaccustomed to an ever shifting surface under her. \"Oh.\" she groaned. ~0~ Not far away, drifting with the breeze, a full grown swallow hummed to a tune that only he knew. He was a friendly swallow who more often than not took to the skies to dream and fantasize about whatever struck his fancy. Most recently, it was the idea of achieving the 'impossible' that occupied his thoughts. As he flew over a pond, Jacquimo was disrupted from his thoughts as he heard a cry for help. \"Whoa, whoa! Help? Who is saying help?\" He looked around and finally the girl crying for his attention. \"Mr. Bird? Over here.\" Landing on a cattail plant, Jacquimo took in the worried look of the little girl. Her unique appearance did not even cross his mind. \"Oh! Oh, little one. Are you having a bad day?\" The little girl stood. \"I was sleeping on my windowsill waiting for Prince Cornelius to come back. And he said he would come when he returned because he loves me.\" Jacquimo gasped. \"He loves you?\" A love story! \"Yes.\" Jacquimo shook her hands enthusiastically. \"Congratulations!\" \"Thanks.\" The girl sniffled. \"But-but I was stolen away by Mrs. Toad, who says I have to marry her son, and I just-\" Jacquimo grimaced. \"A toad? Ptooey! Toad.\" Of all the creatures he had ever met, toads had to be the worst. They were slimy, cunning, selfish, and egotistical. What a poor girl indeed to have been stolen by such créatures dégoûtantes . \"That is a very bad day, mademoiselle . Uh, mademoiselle ...\" The girl curtsied. \"Thumbelina.\" \"Ah, Thumbelina. I am Jacquimo. How may I be of service to you?\" He reciprocated her greeting with a bow. The girl - Thumbelina - stumbled. \"Well, I must get off this lily pad, but that's impossible.\" Jacquimo laughed at Thumbelina's negativity. \"Ha ha ha! Nothing is impossible.\" To show her just how wrong she was, he took it upon himself to dive into the water and snip at the stem of the lily pad, making it start to float away with the current. \"Voila!\" Thumbelina fell over with the movement. \"Oh my, well that was easy.\" Jacquimo chuckled. \"Now...if I could just reach the shore before those awful toads come back.\" Jacquimo looked up from his wringing in time to see the edge of the water disappear down a cliff. He looked back at Thumbelina in alarm. \"You mean if you reach the shore before you go over the waterfall?\" \"What waterfall?\" \"That one!\" Jacquimo jumped about in panic. \"Is it bad?\" Thumbelina questioned with unease. In response, Jacquimo dove to grab the edge of the lily pad in a futile attempt to pull it away from the waterfall that was fast approaching. \"I am slipping!\" \"Hey, don't let go!\" Thumbelina yelled in despair. He didn't, but knowing the futility of his efforts he asked, \"Can you swim?\" Her response made him panic some more. \"No, I can't swim. I can't even float!\" They both began to cry for help. \"Please, somebody help!\" \"Help!\" \"Somebody help!\" Thankfully that last cry grabbed the attention of a lovely fish couple quietly enjoying the morning on their patio. Seizing her hanging and seizing his reading, the helpful Samaritans raced to help out. They also grabbed the attention of two Jitterbugs cutting a cattail with a saw. Jacquimo called out them in fear, \"Jitterbugs, help!\" \"Look out!\" one of them screamed helplessly. They both screamed as they came within inches of the waterfall. Fortunately, a fish's tail reached them in time to slap them further back. Unfortunately, the slap also hit Thumbelina on the still healing bump on her head. She passed out from the pain. Still not out of danger yet, though, the two fish, the Jitterbugs, and a still awake swallow continued to pull and/or push on the lily pad as much as they could. \"Pull, mes amis , pull!\" Jacquimo cried. Feeling the lily pad move further and further away, albeit slowly, he yelled encouragement to all. \"That is it. That is it. Higher! Higher!\" He accidently swallowed water from his efforts and unable to fly due to his wet feathers the male fish had to slap him out of the water and onto the land. At the same time, the jitterbugs and the remaining fish were able to pull Thumbelina's makeshift flotation device onto the very same land. Jacquimo gasped and held his chest. His heart threatened to beat out of his chest. \" C'est bon .\" \"What is it?\" \"Yeah, who is it?\" \"Look, Mama, she's waking up.\" Indeed she was, and with only a minor headache to boot. \"Aw, are you feeling better, little one, hmm?\" Jacquimo asked. \"Yes, I think so.\" She wiped some water from her face. She looked around to see unfamiliar faces gazing at her in relief(and some more who showed up at hearing the commotion). \"But who-who are you?\" \"Thumbelina, these are the Jitterbugs.\" \"The Jitterbugs?\" \"How do you do?\" Remembering from that fateful night they flew over them, the youngest Jitterbug - Baby bug as he was called - asked, \"Are you really going to marry the fairy prince?\" Everyone surrounding the two - excluding Jacquimo who already knew - gasped at the question. As stated before, news of the fairy prince's announcement had spread like wildfire and every critter and animal aware of the existence of fairies knew of the prince's new found love. Of course, as he had never introduced the actual lady in question nor even revealed her name, no one outside of the couple or his parents knew who the girl actually was. Yet here was the very girl in question! Said girl giggled at the question, unaware of the whispered that now occurred between the jitterbugs around her. \"If he asks me. He will call for me at my house.\" But remembering how far away from said home she was, she explained, \"That's why I want to go home. Beside's Mother will be terribly worried.\" She sighed. \"If only I could find my way home.\" Even without the newfound knowledge that she was the future fairy princess, the sadness in her voice would have caused even the most stubborn and indifferent Jitterbug want to help the poor girl. As it was, Baby Bug volunteered all their services for them. \"Aw, we'll help you Thumbelina.\" \"Yeah, nobody'll hurt you, Thumbelina.\" \"Not with us on the job, right?\" Smiling at the ready willingness to help, Thumbelina acknowledged them by saying, \"Oh, you are all very brave. Well, thank you, but I'm afraid I'll never see my home again.\" Not liking the hopelessness in the girl's voice, Jacquimo chirped in with, \"Oh, do you love the prince?\" \"Yes.\" she affirmed. \"Well, then follow your heart! It will lead you home.\" But secretly knowing that would not be enough asked, \"Now, where does the prince live?\" Thumbelina grew hopeful as she knew the answer. \"Oh, oh, he-he lives in the, um...\"It was on the tip of her tong-\"the Vale of the Fairies.\" But she quickly deflated at the realization that \"Oh, I don't know where that is either.\" \"Do not worry. I, Jacquimo, will find it and bring him home to you.\" He chuckled. In a pessimistic state Thumbelina couldn't help but claim, \"Oh, it's impossible.\" Jacquimo could not believe his ears. \"Impossible? Nothing is impossible.\" \"You're sure to do impossible things If you follow your heart Ha ha Your dreams will fly on magical wings When you follow your heart Growing excited with the singing swallow, three jitterbugs - including the one who asked about Cornelius earlier - pushed Thumbelina toward where the swallow danced and three little birds rested. She sat on a nearby mushroom, slightly upset she was being guided again, even if by little jitterbug children. \"If you have to journey far Here's a little trick You don't need a guiding star Trust your ticker, get there quicker Ha ha Thumbelina shook her head in disbelief and resisted the efforts of the jitterbugs to pull her up to dance. \"You're sure to do impossible things If you follow your heart Flying up to two flower buds covered in dew, Jacquimo yelled out, \"Come on, Thumbelina! You are going home. Your mother is waiting. Get up. Get up.\" Hearing his vehement encouragement, she did so and was soon running through a path made up of dancing and cheering birds. \"Yay!\" \"Yay!\" \"You're sure to do impossible things If you follow your heart Your dreams will fly on magical wings When you follow your heart Landing on the ground again, Jacquimo twirled and addresses Thumbelina directly. \"North or South or East or West Where to point your shoes? Which direction is the best? If the choosing gets confusing Maybe it's the map you're using You don't need a chart to guide you Close your eyes and look inside you He accompanied the line by covering and uncovering Thumbelina's eyes much like someone would do when presenting a surprise. She smiled widely, playing along. He held out his arm and strutted with her down a half buried book on the ground. \"You're sure to do impossible things If you know where to start Your dreams will fly on magical wings When you follow Just trust the Swallow And always follow you heart... Jacquimo let her go so the jitterbugs could hold on to her hands. \"Bon voyage, Thumbelina! Never fear! I will find the prince!\" he cried out to her as he took to the air. Thumbelina giggled, now hopeful. \"Goodbye!\" she said back to him with a wave. \"Oh, he's wonderful. And... I'm going home.\" she commented happily to her new little friends, who parted some blades of grass to let her pass. ~0~ At the same moment in the Vale of the Fairies the other half of the famous couple was fast approaching insanity as he spoke to his parents. His wings turned down to reflect his mood. \"Oh, Cornelius, my sunshine, first you buzzed in here the other day on that wretched thing and announced in front of the entire court (here Cornelius frowned and thought, 'Why must she always bring up the court?' ) that you'd found the girl of your dreams and now you've come back to say she's vanished?\" Tabitha was skeptical about this new development, especially as she had yet to meet the girl in question. If she had to be honest, she wasn't too sure that the girl was any good for her son, and with the new discovery of her disappearance she wondered if perhaps the girl wasn't playing her son for a fool. She desperately hoped her son didn't fall for a girl who has after him for his title. Hearing the skepticism in his mother's voice, Cornelius was quick to jump to his beloved's defense. \"Kidnapped, Mother. She's been kidnapped.\" \"You're joking.\" she said in disbelief. \"Tabitha.\" Colbert scolded. He was not as close-minded as his wife was. Choosing instead to focus on his father, the more of accepting of the two, Cornelius begged. \"Father, please delay the winter frost as long as you can. I need time to find Thumbelina.\" He gestured wildly before he set out to do what he most desired. \"Cornelius!\" his mother yelled. Not stopping his trek, Cornelius yelled back assuring, \"Don't worry, Mother. I'll be back.\" \"Cornelius!\" his parents yelled simultaneously. \"I'll find her!\" they heard from the trail of dust flying away. No matter her reserves over the matter, Tabitha was worried for her son. \"Oh, my poor boy.\" She moaned. \"Colbert, my love, we can't delay the frost for more than a day.\" She bit her lip with a frown on her face. ~0~ Simultaneously, another creature of the vale was biting its lip. But this time it was in despair and anger. Despair that his would-be wife was no longer where they left her or even anywhere near there (they checked) and anger that his brothers immediately started laughing upon the discovery. \"Maybe next time you should make sure that you have a bride before rendering my services.\" El padre reproached, dryly. \"Good day to you all. I have other matters to attend to.\" Grundel didn't bother to turn at the splash behind him, still gazing in disbelief at the empty water in front of him. \"What a loss. We would have made big moneys with a voice like that.\" Mrs. Toad tsked and walked off, uncaring for her lamenting son. After all, relationships never last when you have a career in show business. \"Guess she couldn't stand to see an ugly face like yours anymore.\" a heavily accented voice laughed. \"Only a face our mama could love.\" laughed the one next to him. Grundel snarled even as the voices faded into the background. Looking around at some of the artifacts and souvenirs collected, he began to grab and throw the objects in frustration and anger. He grunted and growled, but the violent catharsis proved not enough to make him feel better. This only caused him to become more violent. The noise was enough to bring his mother back outside. \" Ay! What is wrong with you?! Stop! Stop!\" Grundel grunted as his mother wrestled the vase in his hands away from him. \"Have you lost tu mente ?! You clean up right now! Estoy para darte una galleta !\" \"She left me, Mama!\" \" Si , she did. But there are other toads in the pond.\" Mrs. Toad hissed. \"Now clean this up. Or no flies for you tonight!\" One hour later, the boat was cleaned up and Grundel was sufficiently tired. He currently lounged on the very edge of the boat's stage dipping a finger into the water below thinking of what could have been. \"Hey bro-\" Grundel's eye twitched already knowing what was coming- again. \"Go away.\" \"Pond talk say Thumbelina gave you the slip and is going to marry a fairy prince.\" He mockingly flapped his hands. Truthfully, this was news to him. While he had been aware that Thumbelina was with someone the first night he saw her, he was so entranced by her beauty and her voice that he neither paid attention to the person she was with nor what she was actually singing. Hearing of her 'engagement' made him feel like the floor was pulled from under him. In his mind, Thumbelina was his and was meant to be his wife. This 'fairy prince' was intruding on his territory. \"What fairy prince?\" he ground out. Mozo laughed. \"You'll not be able to show your ugly face on the stage no more.\" \"Everybody laugh at you,\" Gringo mocked. Grundel slapped his hand down. \"Nobody laugh.\" They guffawed in response. Annoyed beyond reason, Grundel grabbed his brothers in a chokehold. \"I said nobody laugh.\" They cackled some more. \"I go get Thumbelina and bring her back.\" Grundel asserted. His brothers laughed in disbelief, their stomachs' contracting painfully. Beyond upset, by his failed wedding, by his missing wife-to-be, by his brothers laughter, by this new rival, Grundel made a decision. Grabbing onto his brothers he used all his strength to throw them into the water and claimed, \"I marry her.\" Oh yes, he would. He tried to walk with as much dignity as possible into the surrounding foliage. ~0~ In all the years that Mr. Beetle had been in show business, never has he been in danger of losing his job. Vastly popular with the ladies and highly talented, if you asked him, he had always had a gig lined up before his current gig even ended. Now however, his show at the beetle ball was in danger of going funk. Currently he was strolling along - more like jumping, running, and wallowing - at the bottom of the beetle ball tree in hopes of coming up with a new idea. \"I cannot believe this! What do they think I am? How can they want to be rid of me? Me! The greatest performer of all!\" He gestures wildly to himself, turning and stomping along the beaten dirt path. \"They think they're gonna get anyone better than me? Ha!\" He yelled this out to the sky. \"I'll sure show them.\" He twisted his moustache mischievously. \"I'll give them the best show they'll ever have and when they beg on their knees for me to stay, I'll quit! Ha! I'll make those sucker cry.\" He rubbed his hands together, cackling. \"Hey boss!\" \"What?!\" He screeched, turning to see one of his back up dancers - his youngest cousin - perched on his stomach on a nearby mushroom. He was looking at something further along the path. \"It's a wingless fairy!\" was the response. \"What?\" He asked again. \"Move out the way! Move out the way, grub lover!\" He squinted at the figure coming up the rear. He whistled. \"Boys, I think we found ourselves our next show!\" ~0~ The subject of their scrutiny remained unaware of the eyes trained on her. Instead, she focused on the three Jitterbugs that danced around to her humming. They hardly spoke throughout the journey, which may seem unusual for three little kids, but they were content to simply guide their new found friend through their forest home. They were too entranced by her voice to sense anyone near them until they already saw the shadow of a looming figure on the ground. And looking up, they barely gave Thumbelina time to react when they shouted \"Look out!\" and ran into the surrounding flora. \"Aha!\" Thumbelina screamed as a male beetle suddenly jumped in front of her. The beetle laughed at her fright. \"Hiya, toots! Beetle's my name, and razzmatazz is my game.\" He leaned close to her face. \"How do you do? How you feeling? Everything O.K.?\" He made sure to tickle her face with his moustache. Thumbelina didn't much appreciate his touch. \"I'm not your toots.\" She slapped the moustache away from her face. \"Where do you come from?\" \"Where?\" Beetle shouted obnoxiously. \"Up there.\" Changing the subject, he leaned against the base of a nearby fungi. \"I'm a connoisseur of sweet nectars, \" he switched to rubbing the base, \"a designer of rare threads,\" he backed away and twisted his moustache, \"and a judge of beautiful women.\" Hooking his walker on Thumbelina's back, Beetle turned her to lean on the fungi. \"And you are beautiful, Miss, um...\" Cringing, she answered, \"Thumbelina.\" Slapping away his moustache again, she pointed at him. \"And I'm going home.\" Spinning to block her path, Beetle told her, \"Relax. Take a loaf off.\" Thumbelina moaned in disgust when his facial hair touched her again . \"Ooh, I wish you wouldn't do that.\" \"Perhaps you'd prefer this...\" What he did next disgusted her more. \"Oh, Mr. Beetle, I don't even know you.\" Not even Cornelius had kissed her arms like that. \"Would you stop?\" \"Stop?\" He switched arms. \"How can I stop?\" Another smooch to her hand. \"I'm crazy about you, toots.\" Thumbelina's conviction lowered. \"Stop.\" \"You're gorgeous.\" \"Oh.\" She sighed, her conviction almost nonexistent. However, she pulled her arm from his reach. Barely noticing how her hand was no longer in his, Beetle continued to kiss his own. \"Ooh, you're exciting, ooh, delicious!\" Not seeming to notice how his appreciation transferred to himself, Thumbelina asked, \"I am?\" Remembering what his mission was, Mr. Beetle got back on track. \"And I love the sound of your voice.\" \"My voice?\" Thumbelina sighed happily. \"Don't talk!\" Mr. Beetle demanded, not really caring. \"Sing, sing to me.\" Thumbelina hummed thoughtfully. After a moment, she sang, \"I have an idea. Can you fly me up there?\" Thumbelina unknowingly pointed to the same tree that housed the beetle ball. Earlier on their trek through the terrain, the Jitterbugs had commented their idea to fly her up to the tallest tree around in hopes that she may spot where her house was located. Of course, being that they were only small bug, and children at that, they had no idea of how exactly to get her up the tree in the first place. They had planned to simply have her yell up to one of them what her house looked like, but with it having no unique features they weren't too sure how well that plan was going to go. Now, with a full grown beetle standing in front of her, perhaps their dilemma was solved, Thumbelina thought to herself. Mr. Beetle, who was not apt to help out others out of the goodness of his heart, frowned. \"And why should I, toots?\" \"From the treetops I could see my house. Then I'd know if I'm traveling in the right direction to get home.\" Seeing an opportunity to trap the girl in his scheme, Mr. Beetle slyly claimed, \"That would be a big, big, oh, very big favor.\" \"I'll sing,\" she sang, making Mr. Beetle smirk in victory. \"I'll sing for you.\" \"No, no, you'll sing at the beetle ball...and dance.\" With no warning, he threw Thumbelina over his shoulder and laughed as she screamed in terror. \"We're gonna be the talk of the town, toots!\" Thumbelina covered her mouth, hoping her queasiness would go away soon, but at hearing his favorite nickname for her, she had to say, \"I'm not your toots! And I don't even look like a beetle.\" Oh, he knew. Mr. Beetle knew oh so well. He was counting on it. ~0~ Off to the side, forgotten by both Thumbelina and the beetle, three Jitterbug children looked up at the two leaving adults with apprehension. They had heard everything that was spoken, not wanting to leave Thumbelina alone even if they were unwilling to stay present around the beetle. They weren't too sure what his motive was for stopping them after all. Most beetles tended to stay amongst themselves but the rare few that interacted outside their own species were prone to trickery and manipulation. Seeing what this beetle had planned with Thumbelina, they were glad to have stayed around. \"Come on, let's get help.\" the elder Jitterbug whispered. ~0~ It was a good thing Mr. Beetle found Thumbelina so earlier into the week or otherwise his new idea might not have come to fruition. As it is, they had just enough time to come up with the music and force the beetle ball designer to construct an outfit for Thumbelina... ...but with a little twist. You see, when Mr. Beetle had initially seen Thumbelina, he had found her to be one of the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen. Being one of the few beetles who interacted outside of his own species, he had seen his fair share of creatures, ranging from tall to short, wide to thin. However, he had also spent enough time around his own kind to know that they did not take well to creatures who lacked certain... features. The poor girl would definitely be ugly in the beetle world. Due to this, halfway into creating a song about how beautiful Thumbelina is, Mr. Beetle decided to take a route never explored by him. He settled on surprising the audience with a comedic reveal. So, he made sure to tell the costume designer to make a collapsible outfit. Poor Thumbelina never suspected a thing. And speaking of Thumbelina, the tiny girl spent the better part of the whole week locked away in a room by herself. In fact, the only people who knew she was there was Mr. Beetle, his backup singers, and the costume designer. And for the most part, they only entered on special circumstances. Fortunately for the lonely girl, there was a surprising amount of books and magazines, perfect for someone of her size. Unfortunately, they were all about beetles, the history of beetles, famous beetles, historical beetles, the anatomy of beetles, and so on, and so on. Oh yes, beetles were definitely full of themselves. Thumbelina tried not to complain, still believing Mr. Beetle fully intended to help her once the show was over. Days later at the end of the week, after much advertising by way of mouth to mouth, Mr. Beetle and co. plus Thumbelina set up for their first (and only) show. To Mr. Beetle's delight, it was a full house that night. If the show went according to plans than everyone was sure to have heard about Mr. Beetle and gang by the end of the night. He would be a sensation! \"Let's go, you munch crunchers! Get to your places!\" Mr. Beetle screeched, waving his arms frantically. Hearing a giggle behind him, he turned with a frown and smirked. \"And you...\" he tittered, kissing Thumbelina's hand again, \"little lady, are a vision of loveliness. You should get going to center stage.\" He wiggled his antennae, fortunately not in her face this time, \"The show can't go on without you.\" \"Oh, why, thank you...\" She giggled again and made her way to her dedicated place. Mr. Beetle grinned darkly after her. And then the lights turned down. He quickly hurried to his spot. Minutes later, Mr. Beetle could hear the enthusiastic cheers from the crowd as the curtain hiding them from view rose. To the beetles waiting down below, the sight of the well-known but not yet famous band had them applauding in mild excitement. They knew all about the band that went around making a name for themselves across the glades but they also knew about the recent decline in the group's popularity. In fact, many of the ones in the audience were present due to a desire to watch the 'very last show' of the group's career. They wanted to get a good laugh out of the gig. They would be laughing for a whole different reason. \"Ladies and gentlebugs, Berkley Beetle proudly presents... Thumbelina!\" The crowd's attention was brought to the figure they previously paid no mind to. They gasped at vision presented before them. They hardly paid any attention to the choreography of the five beetles in front of her until Berkley Beetle himself started singing. \" Baby, it's the beetle ball And bugs are crawling to get in When they hear that beetle beat Those beetle feet'll start to spin And how they'll cheer For you, my dear You're beautiful, baby... Thumbelina blushed and acted bashful. \"Oh, my little butterfly You flutter by, and there's romance Every chance to dance with you Puts the ants back in my pants... Thumbelina wiggled a little to the song, not really able to move around much in the outfit. She turned to face Mr. Beetle when he jumped onto her platform. He held out his arm to strut with her down a little ways. \"Let's cut a rug My ladybug You're beautiful, baby... By this point, the audience had taken out their magnifying glasses to get a better look at the beauty. Mr. Beetle twirled Thumbelina before 'serenading' her on his knees. \"I get a burst when I have you on my wing You tie my antennae in a knot Now the room's reelin' And I'm feelin' So ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho- Hot to trot! Jumping back onto the platform, Thumbelina smiled at Mr. Beetle's crazy movements. \"Let's dance Baby!\" he sang as he began to dance a little jig next to her. \"Isn't she beautiful?\" commented the male of an older couple in the audience. His wife, hearing the comment, agreed. \"Just adorable, darling.\" Another beetle, who overheard the commentary, wiggled his eyebrows in accord. The same could not be said for another couple in the audience as when the male said, \"What a piece of work\", his date was not at all amused. The commenter smiled apologetically. Up on stage, Mr. Beetle, knowing that it was his cue to introduce the secret twist to the show, spoke up with, \"O.K., toots, let's wing it.\" Thumbelina's eyes widened in surprise and she frowned in worry. As was said before, she had no idea but this 'sudden change' in the show. \"I-I can't wing it,\" she protested even as Mr. Beetle unapologetically grabbed her hand, \"I don't have any wings,\" and twirled her under his arm, \"I'm getting dizzy!\" The backup dancers expressed their disgust as her outfit 'fell' apart, revealing the humanoid figure underneath. It was all going according to plan. And just as Berkley Beetle predicted, the audience absolutely loved the twist to the song as they laughed at the tiny human girl. \"Ha ha ha ha ha Hee hee hee, ho ho ho ho She's she's she's she's, so so so so Hey, that bug is a dog... Apparently deciding to settle onto what she did understand and know, Thumbelina began to dance the routine taught to her before. \"My, My.\" \"Unattractive.\" \"The word, my dear, is ugly.\" A wife said to her husband. \"She's so ugly, she's hurting my feelings.\" A male interjected. \"I hope it ain't catching.\" \"Disgraceful!\" Of course, these words weren't quiet enough for Thumbelina not to hear. All throughout the routine, she appeared to be smiling but inside she was having a raging battle with herself to keep the smile on her face. She gave up the act to hold her knees in mild pain when one of the dancers hit her popliteal with their stick. \"Would you look at that? She ain't got no wings Good gracious me, what are those things? She ain't go no feelers... \"No feelers?\" the audience gasped to the rhythm of the song. \"She ain't got no shell (\"Do tell\") She got scrawny legs And knobby knees For all we know, the gal's got fleas She can't even fly No that won't do... Mr. Beetle frowned when one of his dancers stepped on his foot. \"So say goodbye, she's not for you\" Dancing up to Thumbelina, Mr. Beetle dramatically claimed, \"I'm sorry, toots, I guess you're too-\" He slapped her butt with his stick. \"-too ugly!\" Thumbelina yelped. \"Don't worry,\" he assured her arrogantly. \"You'll get over me.\" He tipped his hat to her in mock politeness. Thumbelina, however, was more focused on what he said before. \"I'm ugly?\" she whispered brokenly to herself. ~0~ Not far off - in fact, a little too close for Thumbelina's liking if she had known - was her self-acclaimed fiancé, the Toad. Ever since she had managed to escape his capture, Grundel had taken it into his head to search out his missing future wife. And so far, he was having little luck locating her. At first, he had only searched out the immediate vicinity surrounding his temporary home. When that proved useless, he began to expand the area, even heading out directly to where his mama said she had found Thumbelina. Gazing through the window of her room, all he had found was an empty room - neat and clean. Searching the perimeter, and finding only other animals and a very large human woman, Grundel had left grumbling and wondering where his precious girl could be hiding from him. Returning to his home after, he was immediately met with an angry mama, who started hissing at him over his neglecting their show last night. A fight ensured between them and he left feeling more upset than before, vowing to get Thumbelina back so they can make up the money they had lost over his neglect. Heading out east from his home, Grundel moaned over where to next look for Thumbelina, until he came across two beetles talking about some kind of 'going away' show at the beetle ballroom. Ordinarily, this wouldn't have interested him much as he was already aware of how beetles loved entertainment, but the words \"beautiful girl\" caught his attention. Vaguely hoping that the \"beautiful girl\" they talked about was Thumbelina - as there was none as beautiful as she - he set out in the direction of the big tree the beetle ballroom was housed in. It was only pure luck that he came across three Jitterbugs crying over helping Thumbelina. \"Hey, wait for me!\" cried the one with a hat. \"Hurry up! Thumbelina needs help,\" yelled back the seemingly older one. Taking pleasure in scaring the wits out of the children by jumping in front of them, Grundel roared. The Jitterbugs screamed and ran. He laughed as he shook the dead tree they were under to make debris fall down. Unfortunately for the children, enough dead bark fell down to cover the only escape route they had. \"Help!\" they cried. \"Do I hear one of you say Thumbelina needs help?\" Grundel implored. Unthinkingly, Gnatty blurted out, \"Yes.\" \"Gnatty!\" his friend said nervously. \"The beetle took her and flew way up there.\" He was shushed way too late. \"Hmm. The beetle?\" So the beautiful girl was Thumbelina, which means she was captured by the beetles. He spit at the thought. \"I want her back!\" He claimed angrily. The Jitterbugs screamed. \"Come on, let's go!\" They took the opportunity to run under the toad's body. The toad laughed amused. \"You big ugly wart face!\" Grundel laughed again before sobering up. \"Now we see about this beetle.\" ~0~ Fortunately for Thumbelina, even if (and when) Grundel managed to find the beetle the Jitterbugs spoke about, she was no longer with the guy. Unable to stand the jeering and mocking laughter of the beetles after the show concluded, Thumbelina had taken the first chance she had to run away from the ballroom. And knowing that the beetle would most likely not be holding up his end of the bargain, Thumbelina tried her hardest to climb down the big tree all by her lonesome. She only made it so far, however. Only a few steps away from the entrance, Thumbelina dropped exhausted onto a broken tree limb that had dandelions growing out of it. She scowled as her face was reflected back at her from a dew drop. Sniffing a little she dropped her face into her upturned knees and cried silently for a while. When no more tears fell from her eyes, she turned her head to look at the scenery. She frowned at hearing an increasing fluttering sound. She breathed out at seeing Jacquimo appear next to her. \"Why, what is the matter Thumbelina.\" Jacquimo asked. Hearing the concern in his voice, Thumbelina's tears made an appearance again. She sniffled. \"I'm cold... I'm lost... And I'm hungry. And the beetle says I'm ugly.\" She glanced sadly at the dew drops. She almost felt like they were mocking her just as the beetles had done before. \"The beetle?\" Jacquimo had an idea of what beetle she was talking about. \"Ho ho,\" he chuckled. He found it funny that Thumbelina would pay attention to such an egotistical person. \"You love the beetle?\" \"No.\" \"Then never mind the beetle. Good riddance to the beetle.\" And remembering how the girl was here in the first place, \"And good riddance to the toad.\" He blew at the dandelion to make a point. \"Does Prince Cornelius think you are ugly?\" A sniffle, and then, \"No. He thinks I'm beautiful.\" Thumbelina smiled at the thought of her love. \"And so you are, mon amie .\" He turned her around. \"Look.\" With the thought of her beloved in her mind, and the reassurance of her feathery friend, Thumbelina gazed at the dew with new eyes. She gasped, and smiled. \"I'm going home.\" Walking over to her friend, Thumbelina called, \"Jacquimo.\" He hummed. \"Will you find the Vale of the Fairies?\" \"I promise.\" He yawned. \"I promise, but now we must sleep.\" He sighed. \" Bonne nuit .\" he whispered holding out his arm for her. \" Bonne nuit , Thumbelina.\" She laid down on his chest. \"Thank you, Jacquimo. Thank you.\" All her crying had her tuckered out. \"Tomorrow is a new day, and I will go to the forest and see if I can find your Prince Cornelius.\" With that, both the swallow and his friend fell asleep to the gentle breeze. Only the bright sunshine of the new day waking them up. A few days later, Jacquimo found himself working hard at maintaining his promise when he came across a running rabbit. He didn't even think about what the rabbit could be running from. \"Bonjour! Eh, nice sunny day.\" He landed himself on the rabbit's nose. \"It's sunny, all right, but I'm not too sure about the nice.\" was the response. \"Oh, well, I am, uh, looking for the Vale of the Fairies.\" Annoyed already at the distracting swallow, the rabbit asked nasally, \"Fairies, huh? Beats the heck out of me. Why don't you ask a fairy?\" \"Oh, you know one?\" Jacquimo asked, hanging on for dear life to the rabbit's hat. \"No, but he might.\" The rabbit replied, bringing the swallow's attention to the pursuing fox he hadn't noticed somehow. \"Oh, ah, merci .\" Jacquimo let the wind slam him into the rabbit's pursuant. \"Uh, excuse-moi, monsieur . I am looking for the Vale of the-\" The fox was not as friendly as the rabbit was. \"Amscray!\" he interrupted, and almost succeeded in knocking off Jacquimo thoroughly with his paw. Jacquimo didn't let this deter him, but he grew a little nervous as he found himself in the fox's open mouth. \"Where were we? I can see that you are a very busy fox, so I will be brief.\" The fox was irritated. \"Buzz off, buster!\" He slapped away the pesky stranger with his tongue. Sadly, this action forced Jacquimo into a dead tree, whose limbs were so jagged that one of them rammed a thorn into Jacquimo's left wing. \"Now, now look, look what I do.\" Jacquimo winced. \"I have a thorn in my wing.\" Pain shot through his wing as he moved it slightly. \"Oh, this is bad, very bad.\" He stood. \"Oh, mon dieu . I hope I-I still can fly.\" Fortunately he could, though not without a fair share of pain. \"Oh, oh, I fly. Oh, merci .\" He flew to where a vine stuck out from the ground. \"It only stings a little,\" he assured to no one in particular. \"Now, where was I?\" Several leaves falling from a tree was his response. Jacquimo gasped, not having realized how far into the new season they were. \"Autumn. It is Autumn. Oh, I must hurry to find the fairy prince. Winter is almost here.\" ~0~ Jacquimo could not have been more right as only three days later a mighty gust of wind swept through the forest, bringing with it a taste of what the winter frost would be like. Prince Cornelius knew all too well how awful the upcoming winter can be. \"Thumbelina!\" Buzzby and he fought against the leaves blowing onto them. \"Thumbelina, where are you?\" Cornelius groaned when a leaf slammed him off of Buzzby. The wind was too powerful for him to take control of his fall. He grimaced in disgust when he fell into muddy water. \"Oh no.\" Buzzby barely gave him enough time to brace himself when he fly under his master's legs. \"Whoa!\" Seconds later, Cornelius reached his original destination of the Jitterbugs' den. Thankfully, it was still warm enough that most Jitterbugs had yet to fly further in to the log they took possession of, so Cornelius was able to quickly inquire: \"I'm-I'm looking for a beautiful young woman. Her name is- is Thumbelina.\" Cornelius looked down as a small Jitterbug - Gnatty - walked up to him. \"Are you the fairy prince?\" he asked. \"I am.\" \"Thumbelina's gone.\" \"Gone?\" Prince Cornelius couldn't believe his ears. \"Where? Where did she go?\" Why didn't she wait for him? \"The beetle took her away.\" Gnatty replied sadly. Beetle? Wasn't it a toad? \"What?\" \"They're out there. Somewhere.\" answered another Jitterbug. Cornelius' stomach dropped. \"She-She's out there...\" He pointed. \"...in that?\" \"There's a toad after her too.\" Slapping his face, Cornelius muttered, \"Oh, no. I've got to find her. Winter's almost here.\" One day off in fact. The Jitterbugs looked on in encouragement as the fairy prince flew off on Buzzby. \"Hurry, Buzz! The father can't hold back the frost much longer.\" ~0~ It didn't take long for Grundel to find the very beetle that he searched for. Aside from the fact that very few beetles actually cared enough to go into 'the public', this particular beetle liked to brag about how fantastic his show was, what a genius he is, how much fame he would get, and how upset he was for losing Thumbelina before he could get any more inspiration from her. \"Did you say Thumbelina?\" Grundel spoke up angrily. \"What? Who said that? Come out and show your face!\" Beetle asked bravely before yelling in fright when a toad jumped in front of him. His back up dancers weren't so brave. They immediately hid behind some nearby boulders. \"Where is Thumbelina?\" Grundel asked menacingly. \"Thumbelina? The tiny wingless fairy? That chick? What do you want with a gal like her?\" Berkeley Beetle cowered. \"I marry her!\" He declared. \"Where is she?\" \"You're marrying her?!\" Beetle asked bewildered. \"I heard she and the fairy prince were engaged to each other?\" Grundel growled and reached to choke the beetle, who wasn't able to move out of the way fast enough. Mr. Beetle let out some choking sounds, \"O.K. O.K.\" He tried to gasp in some air to continue. \"Can I explain something?\" \"What?\" Some more chocking sounds. \"Look, I don't know where she is.\" Mr. Beetle made sure to articulate each word for the simple-minded toad. \"We didn't hit it off too good, so I let her go. She's not my type. She's an ugly type. I don't like ugly.\" He shook his head at the thought. This wasn't the best thing to tell the toad as he punched Berkeley Beetle's head to the ground. \"She is beautiful!\" he declared angrily and stomped on the beetle's foot. With a scream of pain, Beetle amended, \"Whatever you say.\" Fearful for his safety, he continued, \"Look, I got an idea. I hear that she loves the fairy prince, right?\" Annoyed at the audacity of the beetle to say that Thumbelina loved anyone but him, he beat at the beetle's head as he roared. Mr. Beetle screamed. \"I crush fairy prince.\" Grundel emphasized this statement with a hand gesture. \"O.K. O.K. Shut up and listen.\" Mr. Beetle said annoyed. He straightened his antennae. \"Why don't you just nab this prince, and set up a trap for the girl, using him as the bait? You know, get her to come to you.\" Grundel rubbed at his chin in thought. \"Nab the prince.\" \"And set up a trap.\" Mr. Beetle was glad seeing the toad think about his idea. Maybe he would leave him alone after this. \"Nab the prince.\" he muttered again. Annoyed now, Mr. Beetle reiterated, \"Yes, nab the prince and set up a trap.\" He shook the toad. \"Do you speak English? Try to keep up, Grundel, O.K.?\" In all the years he had known about the pond-side road show, Berkeley Beetle was now glad he had never bothered to go see the toads in action. If he had to keep talking to this fool even one more minute he was going to explode. Grundel pulled at his hat. \"Don't shout!\" \"You're making me very nervous here.\" \"You go capture prince.\" Grundel growled at the beetle, clapping onto the man's back before he cheerfully removed his wings to ensure his compliance. Mr. Beetle shouted in surprise and anger. \"Aah! My wings! You took my wings! You can't do that.\" \"Yeah?\" Grundel cheekily asked as he held back the beetle. \"I keep wings until you nab prince.\" He waved the wings menacingly. \"Listen, pal,\" Mr. Beetle started with false confidence, \"this harassment has gone far enough, and I know my rights!\" He bumped into Grundel's chest. \"I'll report you to the pond patrol.\" Grundel chocked him in response. \"O.K., O.K., cool it. Cool it!\" His bravado left him as quickly as he pretended it came. He coughed when Grundel let him go. \"Where's your sense of humor?\" Grundel shook his hand in warning. Mr. Beetle's sense of preservation kicked in in high gear. \"All right. I'll nab the prince. Come on, guys, mind the wings. I'll be back.\" He walked off with false confidence. ~0~ Jacquimo was not sure about this. He was not sure at all. Winter was only days away and most hibernating animals were packing the last of the food and water they needed for their seasonal sleep. Which made Jacquimo more diligent to get through as many creatures as he could in his quest to find the Vale of the Fairies. Coming across a cave dwelling which housed a sleeping bear, Jacquimo tried not to let nerves get to him as he flew in. \" Excusez-moi, Monsieur Bear .\" A snore, but his head lifted up slightly. \"I am looking for the Vale of the Fairies.\" Apparently, the bear wasn't too awake. \"I don't want no berries.\" The bear grumbled, ending with a sigh that knocked Jacquimo off his feet. Annoyed, Jacquimo said, \"No, no, no.\" He lifted one of the bear's eye-lids. \"Fairies, not berries.\" A snore. Even more annoyed at being ignored, Jacquimo grabbed into an ear. \"Wake up, you fat lummox!\" Awake now, the bear looked around for the noise, not noticing the bird he accidently lifted and dropped into his empty honey pot until said bird cried, \"I said, wake up!\" Unwilling to wake up and hear what the bird wanted, he simply knocked the pot out of his cave. Jacquimo oomph-ed as he went air-born and slammed into a tree. He groaned at his misfortune. \"I am having a very bad day.\" He climbed out and shivered at the cold breeze. \" Mon dieu , it is so cold.\" A piece of icicle bumped his head. Jacquimo gasped as he looked up to see ice settling on the tree behind him. \"Winter! Winter is here.\" A sudden gust of wind threatened to blow him away. \"Whoa!\" Jacquimo cried out as he held on for dear life to the honey pot, but eventually losing in the battle. Trying to take control of his involuntary flight, Jacquimo winced at the pain in his wing, which grew in intensity the longer it went without treatment. \"Oh, this thorn. Oh, it hurts to fly.\" ~0~ Jacquimo was not the only one having trouble with the incoming winter as the cold wind quickly turned into a snowstorm. Cornelius and Buzzby were having a grand old time trying to steer through the tumultuous storm, which actually did come later than normal. Well, just one day late, Cornelius couldn't really fault his parents for such a small delay. \"Don't worry, Buzz. We're going to make it.\" Cornelius said encouragingly even though he felt the opposite was true. But trying to push back the negative thoughts, he yelled out, \"Thumbelina!\" right before flying at top speed through a leaf. So fast they went that Cornelius had to look back to see what exactly they had hit in the first place. Unfortunately, this little action was enough for them to lose control of their flight and Buzzby quickly did a downward spiral. Cornelius was quick to react and managed to keep his friend from slamming them both into the ground, however, he was not quick enough to stop them from landing haphazardly onto a rock face. Cornelius didn't have time to call out as a ball of snow knocked him off of Buzzby and into a thin sheet of ice floating on a pool of water. But so cold was the weather that Cornelius didn't have enough time to swim out before the water froze. As it was only his right index finger met the air. It was a good thing indeed that fairies had magic circulating within their bodies. If not for that and their vastly hotter body temperature, he would have surely perished in an instant. Of course, that is not to say that they could live for millennia while encased in ice but Cornelius could very well survive through the winter with no problems. This ability to perpetually 'hibernate' was a closely guarded secret of the fairies, which fairies used to their advantage when wars or battles broke out. It was so close a secret that even Buzzby had no idea of this ability and therefore, he could not be faulted for buzzing in despair as he landed on the frozen water. He flew off to the Vale of the Fairies, unable to help his master. Thumbelina's forget-me-not necklace broke and flew off with the wind. Not too long later, just a few hours after he froze, an 'infamous' wingless beetle and his four pals shivered across the snow covered terrain and onto the frozen waters. And apparently the leader of the group had been complaining about a certain toad the whole way. \"See, no, he takes my wings away. Now I have to walk to find the prince. See, if he let me keep my wings, I could fly after the prince and bring him back in two seconds.\" Mr. Beetle complained as he shivered in his dress shoes and faced away from his cousin, currently on his knees to see what the dark matter under the ice was. He turned at his cousin's excited claim of: \"Hey, Beetle, this guy's the prince!\" \"The prince?\" Mr. Beetle muttered, taking a second for the information to sink in. \"Aah! The prince!\" he shouted when it finally did. \"Somebody up there loves me!\" \"The prince. O.K., O.K. You pick him up.\" Beetle directed to his cousins as they cracked the ice with their feet and lifted the encased prince out of his prison. \"Let's get out of this stinking weather before we're statistics.\" Beetle shivered. His cousins began to push at the ice cube he stood on. \"I can't even feel anything in my feelers anymore.\" He complained about the cold until they got to a cliff side, where an old human's shoe rotted on the edge, and where he switched back to the original topic of discussion. \"A guy with my brains, I got to talk to a toad. What kind of conversation can you have with a toad? They're toads. They're greens. They're toads...\" He trailed off when he turned to look at his dancers and noticed a silhouette moving toward the old shoe they passed. \"Wait. Wait. Wait. You guys wait here. I gotta see if that's who I think it is.\" Mr. beetle was quick to scurry back to where the shoe laid and smirked when he noticed a familiar head of hair. He waited. ~0~ A month and one week. A month and one week since she last saw her beloved prince. And a month since she last saw her beloved mother. It really was true that you didn't know what you had until it was gone. Moving out of the tree trunk cavern they trekked through Thumbelina almost turned back when she felt the bitter cold of the winter. But plunging on through the cold, Thumbelina actually did plunge through a half-frozen puddle when she flew through some grass blades. She coughed as she climbed out and shivered when she fell onto the snow bank. Looking around in despair, Thumbelina's gaze caught sight of an shoe and taking her chances - because what else was around that might help her? - she climbed to the cliff edge. Burrowing under the old sock still present, Thumbelina grumbled, \"Jacquimo was wrong. I will never find my way home. It's impossible.\" She pulled the sock over her head and got as comfortable as she could. \"Oh, Mother, where can you be?\" She began to sob. ~0~ It appeared that two hearts can beat as one as both mother and daughter's hearts panged with need and sorrow for each other. As Thumbelina wallowed over missing her mother, so too did her mother reciprocate the feelings. Once again spending the evening in her daughter's room, Thumbelina's mother stood to close the wind from the frosty draft flowing in. She gazed sadly and worriedly out to the white landscape. She wondered if Thumbelina, wherever she may be, was somewhere safe, sound, and warm. She refused to believe that her daughter was anything but. \"I know there's someone Somewhere Someone Who's sure to find her soon... Bringing out the formal yellow dress she had hoped to gift Thumbelina for Christmas, she laid it out on the crib's pillow. \"After the rain goes There are rainbows She'll find her rainbow Soon... She opened the last book she had read to her daughter. \"Soon my breaking heart will mend Soon a happy ending Troubles behind her She patted Hero's head. \"I will find her Homeward bound Safe and sound And soon...\" ~0~ Mr. Beetle waited far longer than he actually needed to. And waiting cost him the chance to act. But he couldn't say that the alternative actually upset him too much. You see, originally, Berkeley Beetle intended to wait until Thumbelina fell so deeply asleep that he could drag her off to the toad without her noticing. Maybe then he would gain his wings back since he would bring both the prince and the girl at the same time! But he had waited too long and apparently he wasn't the only one to see the girl take refuge in the old shoe as he found out when a female field mouse showed up sniffing right as he was about to act. He cursed inwardly as he watched the field mouse scurry off with his prize. Following silently, he saw the mouse enter a underground dwelling and he hung back a moment, watching to see if she came back out. She didn't. He hurried back to where his cousins waited. ~0~ It was a while before Thumbelina became fully conscious again as Ms. Fieldmouse would come to find out. Well, in actuality it would be a little more than a while before Thumbelina would wake. Three days in fact. Ms. Fieldmouse had had a mighty tough time taking care of her unconscious guest as just hours after rescuing her from the shoe, the girl had developed a high fever, the likes of which Ms. Fieldmouse had never seen before. On and off, her guest would awake with rough coughing fits and shivers, and Ms. Fieldmouse would have to wipe her down with warm water from her kitchen. So much so that she had to keep the poor girl right in the room so she wouldn't have to continually roam back and forth inside her house. But thankfully, after two days of fighting off the fever, Thumbelina was on her way to a full recovery. Sadly, news from across the Vale might upset her back into a relapse. Midday on the third day, Thumbelina showed signs of waking up. First, with a flutter of her eyelids. Second, with mumbled nothings every once in a while. In the mean time, Ms. Fieldmouse began to prepare the corn cakes Mr. Mole - her neighbor since she could remember - absolutely loved. It wasn't something she did all the time for her neighbor, but with her new guest dwelling not far from here, she felt it was something she had to do. You see, during the springtime, Mr. Mole and her had had a very enlightening conversation about what he sees for his future. Aside from keeping his riches and furthering his studies, Mr. Mole was searching for a wife to keep him company. And the more talented she was the better for him. Ms. Fieldmouse had smirked at the time because he had also mentioned that he would pay handsomely to anyone who acted as matchmaker between him and his wife. Coming across the very girl that rumors had mentioned had a lovely singing voice was just pure luck and a blessing. Of course, that was not to say that she wouldn't have saved anyone else that was freezing to death but her generosity wasn't free either. Hearing movement behind her, Ms. Fieldmouse asked, \"Feeling better, my dear?\" She checked the soup she was making and sniffed at the air appreciatively. \"Ohh...\" moaned the girl. \"Where-where am I?\" \"In my kitchen.\" Ms. Fieldmouse answered as she brought over warm tea. \"I'm Ms. Fieldmouse, and we're snug and safe underground.\" \"I'm underground?\" Thumbelina asked astonished. \"Yes, dearie. Three feet under. I dug it myself with my own two hands.\" Ms. Fieldmouse replied proudly. She poured some tea in a mug. \"Here. Drink this.\" \"At least that toad won't find me down here.\" Thumbelina commented, passing the mug between her hands waiting for it to cool down. Knowing about the toad through the grapevine Ms. Fieldmouse let out a \"Ha.\" She scurried back to her kitchen to check on her soup. \"You know, there's something I don't understand. Did you really think you could survive the winter in that old shoe?\" She giggled. \"Honestly.\" She shook her head. Thumbelina sighed. \"I want to go home.\" \"Well, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait here till spring, Thumbelina.\" It took Thumbelina a moment to realize that she never told this stranger her name. \"You know my name?\" \"Oh, that's easy. I know much more like, you were engaged to the fairy prince, um, Cornelius, I believe.\" \"Well, almost.\" Thumbelina answered not noticing the use of the word, 'were'. \"Oh, that is so sad.\" \"What?\" \"That he was found stone-cold-frozen dead in the snow.\" Ms. Fieldmouse said unthinkingly as she batles with the carrot she was cooking into her soup. Thumbelina gasped as pain slashed up her body and through her heart. (\"But of course, you knew that.\") She didn't feel the tears that poured from her eyes. She fell back onto the bed when her knees wobbled and failed under her. \"No, no, no... Cornelius,\" she gasped out around her sobs. The tea mug shattered on the ground. \"No!\" she cried in despair. Up above a certain beetle listened through the smoke pipe, and he smirked at hearing the despair from the girl. It sure showed her , he thought with a chuckle. He listened for a few more minutes before quickly leaving to report back to the toad. \"That is so sad.\" \"No, it's not true. No!\" Thumbelina sobbed. Ms. Fieldmouse bit her lip not knowing how to comfort the girl so hanging back for a second she turned to finish her soup. She frowned hearing the wet sobbing behind her go on for minutes, almost an hour, before it turned to dry heaves and sniffles and finally finishing with the occasional sniffle and gasps. She carefully walked back to the girl to see her wiping at her tear tracks. She frowned. \"Oh, Thumbelina, forgive me. I just blurt things out without thinking.\" Ms. Fieldmouse said, but not truly sympathetic, continued, \"You're still young, though. There'll be another.\" \"He was perfect.\" Thumbelina sighed. \"Nobody's perfect.\" Ms. Fieldmouse wiggled her finger at the thought. \"Now, if you like, you can stay with me the whole winter, but you must keep my room clean and neat, and tell me tales, for I am very fond of them.\"(1) Thumbelina, not seeing any other alternative, agreed. Ms. Fieldmouse handed her a bowl of soup and they ate quietly for the next half-hour, mostly as Thumbelina was lost in memories of her departed prince. Seeing this, Ms. Fieldmouse cut into her thoughts, \"Come on, Thumbelina, everyone this side of the Vale knows of you through the fairy prince. I'm sure you'll be getting marriage proposals again soon.\" Hopefully from a certain mole , she added in her head. \"Cornelius was the only one-\" Ms. Fieldmouse interrupted her with a thrown shawl. \"Now, put this on. We'll take these corn cakes to Mr. Mole. He lives just down the tunnel.\" \"I'd rather not.\" Thumbelina whispered. \"Oh... I saved your life this very day and you'd rather not?\" She put a hand to her chest to emphasize the statement. Thumbelina sniffed. \"Very well.\" Taking the pan out of the oven, Ms. Fieldmouse asked, \"Oh, one more thing. Is it true that you have a beautiful voice?\" Thumbelina's head fell into her hands. \"I don't feel much like singing.\" \"Oh, you must sing for Mr. Mole. He loves sweet things.\" Turning to Thumbelina, she implored her to stand. \"Come on.\" She handed over the basket of corn cakes. \"Mr. Mole loves his corn cakes.\" Pausing as a thought crossed her mind, Thumbelina muttered sadly, \"Cornelius was looking for me.\" She sniffled. \"That's what must have happened.\" ~0~ Walking under a sign that announced \"What's mined is mine\", Thumbelina followed Ms. Fieldmouse through what appeared to be a crown turned into a mud room. Walking through another door, she heard her host say \"Good afternoon, Mr. Mole.\" \"Oh, yes...\" said the other person in the room. He sniffed. \"Ms. Fieldmouse. Good afternoon. Lovely day.\" He answered back, spilling his tea every which way. \"Meet a new friend of mine-Thumbelina.\" Said girl stepped up unsure. \"She just came down from... up there.\" \"Up there?\" Mr. Mole tilted his head up, not noticing as Thumbelina held out the basket of corn cakes. \"Up there.\" Ms. Fieldmouse reiterated. \"Terrible place.\" The mole groaned in disgust. He sniffed and hummed at the delightful smell - of Thumbelina. \"How do you do, Miss Thumbelina? Please to make your acquaintance.\" As he looked a little lower than was appropriate and held his hand much higher than he should've, Thumbelina finally realized what Ms. Fieldmouse withheld on their way here. Mr. Mole was blind. \"Uh, h-how do you do, Mr. Mole?\" Thumbelina stuttered, unsure how to handle someone like him. Thank fully he turned away just as quickly. \"Come in. Come in. Uh, don't touch anything.\" He turned to give them a sharp look. \"These are my things.\" \"We brought some corn cakes for you.\" Thumbelina felt her be pushed forward. \"Just you try one, Mr. Mole.\" Thumbelina held out the basket again. Mr. Mole ooh-ed and hummed as he forcefully grabbed one - almost causing Thumbelina to drop them - and stuffed his face with it, barely even chewing it before swallowing. \"Very nice,\" he complemented, spitting out crumbs without care. \"Now, tell us about... up there. Went up there once, nearly blinded me. Hurried as fast as I could back down where it's dark and decent.\" Choosing to push back depressing thoughts to focus on more happier ones, Thumbelina set down her basket. \"Oh, but, uh...I love the light.\" She twirled. \"I hate it. End of story.\" Mr. Mole said, forcefully ending the discussion. Seeing an opportunity to show how amazing Thumbelina could be for a future wife, Ms. Fieldmouse interjected with, \"Story? Thumbelina, tell Mr. Mole a story, a lovely, sad story.\" She fell back into the chair she sat in. \"Well, uh-\" Thumbelina sighed unsure, but still set down her cargo. \"Stand right there where I can see you.\" Mr. Mole demanded, gesturing to a music box he used as a coffee stand. He squinted as he moved to sit next to Ms. Fieldmouse where a giant 'M' indicated his ownership of the furniture. \"O.K. Um-\" Thumbelina muttered before climbing up on said music box. \"Oh, I love love stories, don't you?\" Ms. Fieldmouse commented to Mr. Mole, subtly trying to appeal Thumbelina to him. She turned back to her guest when she began speaking. \"Once upon a time, there was, um, the sun.\" \"Sing it, Thumbelina. Sing.\" Ms. Fieldmouse demanded. She smiled inwardly when Mr. Mole finally showed interest. \"She sings?\" She shushed him. \"Oh. Um...\" \"Once there was the sun Bright and warm and wonderful Shining like the love within my heart... Thumbelina smiled at the memory of when Cornelius took her to the autumn festival and danced with her across the water. Acting out their dance moves, Thumbelina grinned until she remembered how they will never enjoy a moment together again. \"Now there's no more sun Winter has killed everything And although it's dark December Forever I'll remember sun\" She finished with a pout as the memory of their dance faded away. \"Winter has killed everything...even the sun.\" She rubbed her hands sadly. \"Wonderful story.\" Ms. Fieldmouse sighed content, after all she was not a big believer in love. \"Dreadful thing, the sun.\" Mr. Mole commented. He picked up his walking stick. \"And now, I have a story to tell you.\" He walked to a door on the other side of the room. \"Just this morning on my early morning stroll, I stumbled across the most extraordinary thing in my tunnel- a dead bird.\" \"No.\" Ms. Fieldmouse gasped softly. \"Yes.\" Mr. Mole assured strongly. Thumbelina paid no attention as she looked disturbed at her surroundings. While the sight of rare gems and treasures amazed her, the sight of cobwebs and moth-eaten fabrics sent chills through her body. \"How do you suppose a dead bird got into my tunnel?\" Mr. Mole continued as they walked into a room full of nailed up bugs, which had Thumbelina staring amazed and disgusted. \"Oh, well, I'm certainly glad I'm not a bird...bothering the world with endless twittering, twittering, twittering.\" \"My, yes.\" Ms. Fieldmouse agreed before setting sights on the bird. \"Oh! There it is.\" Thumbelina turned at this and gasped at seeing that the bird they spoke about was none other than Jacquimo. Her legs threatened to buckle again. Ms. Fieldmouse held her cheeks. \"Whatever do you suppose happened to him?\" Mr. Mole squinted at the figure, trying to magnify it with his glasses. \"Well, there's one less bird to twitter, twitter, twitter up there.\" \"Oh, Jacquimo.\" Thumbelina breathed. \"Jacquimo, my dear, dear friend.\" For the second time that day, Thumbelina broke down into sobs over her friends' body. And there they will find her every time Ms. Fieldmouse and her would visit Mr. Mole for the next seven days. Every time, Thumbelina would be forced into telling a story through song and so the mole fell in love with her because of her beautiful voice.(2) But neither of them could stop her from visiting her dead friend in the tunnel. One such time, Mr. Mole and Ms. Fieldmouse stood behind the girl and gazed as she rubbed at her friend's chest. \"Tender little thing.\" Ms. Fieldmouse sighed. \"Yes. Quite lovely,\" the mole agreed and cleared his throat. \"Ms. Fieldmouse, could I have a word with you?\" Mr. Mole looked down to where he thought the field mouse still stood. \"I wish you would.\" Ms. Fieldmouse said happily, thinking that she knew exactly what the mole was going to ask. \"Ms. Fieldmouse...you know I have been meaning to take a wife for some time now.\" \"What a lovely idea.\" she responded, slyly. \"I find myself sometimes...um, you know...lonely for companionship.\" \"What could be more natural?\" \"And I wonder if...\" \"Yes?\" \"If I could ask you to help me persuade Miss Thumbelina to-to-to be-be my wife.\" She acted surprised at the revelation. \"Thumbelina?\" Mr. Mole smiled gaily. \"She could keep me company and tell me stories, don't you think?\" \"Yes.\" \"And for your service in helping to arrange this match, I will reward you handsomely.\" Mr. Mole held up one of his gold coins. Quickly grabbing hold of the precious coin, Ms. Fieldmouse assured enthusiastically, \"Oh, I will. I will.\" much like a girl would when being asked for her hand in marriage. \"Dear Ms. Fieldmouse.\" Mr. Mole said appreciatively. \"Leave the arrangements to me.\" She wiped at the coin until she saw her reflection. \"Thumbelina...\" she called. But the girl was too busy with her new discovery as she pressed her ear close to Jacquimo's chest. \"I-I hear your heart. You're not dead. No! Jacquimo...\" Thumbelina sighed happily. \"Jacquimo...\" she rubbed at his face. \"I'll come back tonight.\" \"Thumbelina?\" called Ms. Fieldmouse again. Thumbelina stood reluctantly. ~0~ \"One ice-cold prince coming up.\" Mr. Beetle yelled proudly, riding on the ice as his cousins pushed it. \"Where do you want him?\" Grundel grinned. \"There.\" His grin turned into a frown as he looked closely at the prince. \"He looks dead.\" \"Dead? Dead, schmed! What difference does it make?\" Beetle cried falling over onto his butt. \"You killed him.\" Grundel accused. \"O.K., O.K. Have it your way. I killed him. There. You satisfied? Huh?\" Mr. Beetle said, fed up with the toad's ever-changing attitudes. \"Forget the prince. All right? Now, uh, what if I were to tell you I know where Thumbelina is right now, huh? What if I were to tell you that?\" he revealed slyly. \"Would you give me my wings?\" He wiggled his fingers hopefully. Grinning at the thought of finding his future wife, Grundel cheered, \"I'm glad you kill prince. It's a deal.\" He shook the beetle's hand. \"Good. My sources tell me she's buried alive with the mole.\" \"Mole?\" Grundel asked angrily. \"What mole?\" \"If I were you, I'd get my tail over there and save her. Go, get hopping.\" He pushed at the toad. \"Oh, and my wings, please. Would you please? My wings.\" \"Quiet! Where does mole live? I go kick down his door.\" He picked up the beetle roughly. \"Ow. Oh, ooh. Stop, stop, stop. Let go of my arm. What's going on? Where are we going?\" \"We go rescue Thumbelina from the mole.\" Being let down onto his feet, Beetle tried to pull his arm out of Grundel's. \"Mole? Are you out of your mind? I'm not going down there. You know what that guy does to beetles? You have any idea what he does? He stuffs them. He stuff them and pins them on his walls.\" He gestured dramatically, accidently slapping the toad's nose. Grundel pushed him down. \"Quiet!\" \"Look, why don't you just go home and marry a toad? You ever think about that? You find yourself a pretty toad with warts and you marry her.\" Beetle pointed out as he was dragged across the snow. \"Quiet!\" \"Toads, toads.\" Beetle moaned woefully. \"I'm going to be stuffed...\" Thankfully, neither males noticed the three Jitterbug children eavesdropping on them. \"They've got the fairy prince. We've got to help him.\" said the littlest one. Agreeing, the elder one declared, \"Come on, guys. Let's build a fire.\" Which was all well and good except that with snow littering the ground without barriers all the wood around was wet, meaning that fire was not so easy to build. They unanimously decided to fly back to where all the other Jitterbugs slept for the winter to collect from the stack they had already built up. But upon arriving home and explaining to the adults what they needed the wood for, they were told to guide them to where the fairy prince was. Of course, all of them still remembered the girl they saved from drowning and the boy that showed up days later desperately searching for said girl. So they were only too glad to help move the prince to a safer location. They even helped stack him on top of ice posts. This maneuver, though, took them days to accomplish with how heavy the ice was and how small they were. They left with a warning to the children to stay out of trouble. ~0~ Things were not going so well over at Ms. Fieldmouse's home. Especially not for Thumbelina. You see, even with the knowledge that Jacquimo was still in fact very much alive, the thought that both Cornelius and her friend would not have been out in the snow storm if not for her had her noticeably less hyper and outgoing than she normally would be. Every night, she found herself to be shedding tears next to Jacquimo even as she nursed him the best she could, bringing him warm blankets and filling his throat with water. She also laid the tender stamina of flowers, which were soft as cotton, and which she had found in the field-mouse's room, around the bird, so that he might lie warm.(3) She normally had to sneak her way to the tunnel as both the mole and her host were not fond of the swallow at all. The news that Ms. Fieldmouse had arranged for her marriage to the mole also hit her like a rocket. \"Now you are a bride, Thumbelina,\" said the field-mouse. \"Our neighbor has asked for your hand. What a great piece of luck for a poor child! Now you must will have to make your outfit, both woolen and linen clothes; for you must lack nothing when you are the mole's wife.\"(4) \"What?\" Thumbelina cried incredulous. \"But I don't want to marry Mr. Mole.\" \"But of course, you do! It's not like you have any other prospects around.\" \"Cornelius was the one I wanted.\" Thumbelina told her depressed. \"All the same, we'll make it a thrilling wedding.\" Ms. Fieldmouse said ignoring her, turning the key to lock her door. \"Why, it's a wonderful match. Mr. Mole is the richest rodent for miles around. Educated, well-dressed, highly thought of. Never mind that he can't see.\" She pinched at Thumbelina's cheeks, making the girl squirm. \"Ha ha. That's all the better.\" \"How could I possibly marry Mr. Mole? I don't love him.\" \"Love?\" Ms. Fieldmouse rolled her eyes at the word. \"Love is what we read about in books, my dear.\" She took off her robe to jump into a pin cushion. \"'Here Comes the Bride' Is a lovely little ditty But marrying for love Is a foolish thing to do Cause love won't pay the mortgage Or put porridge in your bowl... \"Dearie...\" she sang, bopping Thumbelina's chin with a pin. \" Marry the mole .\" Thumbelina rubbed at her chin. Pushing her head through a white fabric she used as sheets, Ms. Fieldmouse let it fall around her in an imitation of a white wedding dress. She grabbed a nearby string to tie around her waist. \"True, it's a fact That he's not exactly witty He's blinder than a bat But at least his eyes are blue... She batted her eyes in emphasis. \"His breath may be alarming But he's charming for a troll Dearie... She handed over the pin to Thumbelina, who used it to rest her head. Then she pushed some powder into Thumbelina's face making her sneeze as it got into her nose. \" Marry the mole .\" \"Romeo and Juliet Were very much in love when they were wed They honored every vow So where are they now? They're dead, dead... She kicked at a key next to her and Thumbelina looked on shocked at what the field-mouse just said, even though she had no idea who Romeo and Juliet were. \" Very, very dead .\" Ms. Fieldmouse danced down her front steps during her pause. She leaned to grab a flower she set up for decoration next to them. \"Poor Thumbelina Your brain's so itty-bitty I hate to seem a pest But I know what's best for you... Thumbelina furrowed her eyebrows in annoyance at what her host said but kept quiet. When Ms. Fieldmouse wiggled the flower she held in her face, she gritted her teeth and pull at the flower as she handed over the pin, upset. \"Just think of all the ways that you Can decorate a hole Just take my advice I'll bring the rice Dearie... Marry the mole... Seeing her host thrust the pin at the sack she knew held rice above her head, Thumbelina hurried to stand on the chair she sat on, lest she be buried with grain. She looked on only a little surprised as her eccentric host danced about the rice on her cushion as she waved about the white cloth she was once dressed in. \"Marry the mole.\" Thumbelina almost lost her balance when said cloth was thrust over her head without notice and was wrapped around her body. \" Marry that mole...\" sang the field-mouse as she pushed the cushion onto Thumbelina's head. she gathered some rice to throw up like confetti. \"'M' is for money\" she continued kicking up some more rice. \"Oh...\" Thumbelina moaned as a grain hit her eye. \"L-E\" finished Ms. Fieldmouse. Later that night, Thumbelina snuck back out with only a small blanket and a candle this time with her. Walking slowly so as not to accidently wake up the mole, who's hearing seemed to increase with the loss of his sight, Thumbelina gazed sadly at her friend. She crouched and draped the small blanket over the swallow as much as she could. \"Please be warm, dear friend. Please live.\" Thumbelina sighed. She frowned at Jacquimo's pained filled face, even in sleep. \"I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. I know now... there's no place in this big world for little people. We-We cannot do impossible things. Perhaps I should marry the mole. He could take care of me. He could.\" She hummed thoughtfully and a moment later said with resolve, \"I will. I will marry the mole.\" It seemed as if her negative thoughts roused Jacquimo's conscious for at that very moment he moaned and groaned, signaling his awakening. Thumbelina was quick to raise up to her knees to stare into his face. \"Uh, you are joking.\" Jacquimo groaned. Seeing his eyes open, Thumbelina beamed. \"Jacquimo?\" \"Marry the prince.\" Jacquimo demanded lifting his head to look at her. Thumbelina paid his statement no mind as she threw herself into him. \"Jacquimo! You're awake.\" She didn't notice his grimace as she giggled in happiness. \"Oh, oh, Jacquimo.\" He sputtered in pain. \"Oh-Oh, I'm sorry.\" Thumbelina sighed finally noticing. \"I have a thorn in my wing.\" Jacquimo told her by way of explanation. \"A thorn? Well, let me see.\" Thumbelina moved to the wing he indicated and looking at it now she wondered how she could have ever missed such a thing. Too wrapped up with his death-like sleep she supposed. \"Well... hold still,\" she said as he moved around already anticipating pain. When she got a firm hold of the thorn she was quick to pull it out. \"There.\" \"Ah!\" Jacquimo smiled as Thumbelina kissed at the wound. \"Oh, now it will get better.\" He moved to stand. Thumbelina waved her hands at this. \"Don't get up.\" \"I'll go to find the Vale of the Fairies and the prince.\" Jacquimo declared, swaying around dangerously. \"You silly bird.\" Thumbelina scoffed. \"Don't you understand?\" She did not want to go through this again. He wiggled his finger at her. \"Get on my back. Get on my back. I will take you to the Green Forest.\" \"Be realistic. Cornelius is gone.\" Thumbelina reminded him, forgetting that with him having been unconscious for the start of winter there was no way for him to have heard the news of the fairy prince's death. Paying no attention to the girl, since surely she was spouting off more negative nonsense, Jacquimo assured her, \"I will find him.\" \"Jacquimo, don't. (\"Remember-\") Jacquimo. (\" You're sure to do impossible things \") Stop! Stop it, Jacquimo!\" Thumbelina yelled out angrily. \"Your heart...\" he sang, clutching at his wounded arm. \"Bon voyage, mon amie. Bon voyage!\" He yelled back flying into the winter sky. \"No... Jacquimo...\" Thumbelina sighed, falling to her news. \"Oh, Jacquimo, stop torturing me. Cornelius is dead.\" ~0~ Jacquimo was not the only person still positive about reuniting the prince with his princess. Three Jitterbug children, in fact, were highly anticipating the moment the prince would wake up from his icy sleep. They only hoped the fire would be quick in melting the ice away. Adding more wood to the fire, Li'l Bee turned as Baby Bug asked, \"Does he know Mr. Mole's going to marry Thumbelina?\" \"We'll find out when the ice melts, then we'll tell him.\" They all flew up to the top of the cube, where they promptly almost slipped right back off. \"Whoa!\" \"Unh.\" They reached for the finger sticking out of ice to hold on to. He wiggled from their weight which Li'l Bee misinterpreted. \"Look, he's waking up.\" They would soon find out he wasn't as hours later they had to kick his body away before it plummeted into the fire directly below. \"Oh no...\" Gnatty mumbled, looking at the unconscious prince. \"What do we do now?\" Looking at the prince with a finger to his lip, Li'l Bee replied bravely, \"We make him better again, of course! He's the only one that can save Thumbelina from Mr. Mole!\" It would be days before Cornelius showed signs of awakening, and even more before he would open his eyes and be able to stand. ~0~ It was during his recovery time that Ms. Fieldmouse would hire four spiders to weave for her day and night, whilst Thumbelina was forced to turn the spindle. Every evening they would visit with the mole, or he them, and Thumbelina was sick at hearing him talk so badly about all the things she found beautiful. Repeatedly she would be forced to listen as he ranted about how awful the sun was, that it burned the earth as hard as stone, and how he was glad to be celebrating his marriage with Thumbelina on Spring's eve.(5) Thumbelina lamented not having anywhere to escape to. When winter was due to end in one week, her outfit was ready. When Ms. Fieldmouse pointed this out to her, Thumbelina wept and said she would not have the mole. \"Fiddlesticks!\" came the reply. \"Don't be obstinate, you ungrateful girl. He is a fine man whom you are going to marry. He's almost as rich as the royals! He has a full kitchen and cellar. Be thankful for it!\"(6) The wedding came all too soon for Thumbelina, who stood downtrodden out of sight waiting for the organist to begin playing. She was wearing a gray and pink wedding dress with gold trimming, not at all to her liking but what was she to do when Mr. Mole made all the decisions about the outfit? He had even made the decision of what her hair was to look like and what jewelry she was to wear. Fortunately, she had been able to pass off Cornelius' ring as a family heirloom - since Mr. Mole had never bothered to find out enough about her background to know her mother was human - and as he was unable to see for himself that the ring was a royal ring he amended to her desire. One of the few he had allowed his precious \"gem\" to have. He wouldn't even be allowing her to see the sun once spring came! Thumbelina had wept at that. She gnawed her lips to keep from crying and moved forward at the sound of the organ playing the Wedding March. As the guests stood in attention, Thumbelina gazed sadly down at her ring. In a much happier world, Cornelius and her would be the ones getting married that day, sharing a honeymoon on the first week of spring. But that was not to be. He was dead and Thumbelina had to move on with her life, even if it resulted in an unhappy one. Maybe she could learn to love the mole some day. She covered the ring with her other hands. But it seemed Cornelius' spirit was not going to leave her alone on her wedding day as only a few paces down the aisle, his voice and image on the window made her pause in her trek. Let me be your wings Let me be your only love Let me take you far beyond the stars- Thumbelina turned from where she had unconsciously faced the tinted glass at the sound of the priest's voice. \"Uh, Mr. Mole, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded, uh, eh, wife?\" She only made it about two-thirds of the way before his voice cut through her mind again, seemingly coming from his ring. It's bright green gem theoretically sucked her into a trance as it reminded her strongly of Cornelius' eyes. Let me be your wings Let me lift you high above Everything we're dreaming of Will soon be ours She snapped out of it when the mole cleared his throat and answered, \"I do\". Her hallucinations weren't through with her as Cornelius' image was projected into the wax of the candle at the end of the aisle. Anything that you desire Anything at all... \"And, uh-eh-uh, Thumbelina, do you take this, uh, mole to be your lawful wedded, uhh, husband?\" The mole turned to look at her with a very disturbing look on his face. Thumbelina, however, was too engaged with the memory of when Cornelius gave her the ring to notice. \"Do not forget me,\" she said, not forgetting how he was to leave her alone for the following week. Cornelius lowered his head so Thumbelina could place the necklace around his neck. He also didn't miss the type of flower it was made of. \"Forget-me-nots.\" he breathed. Wanting to give her something in return, Cornelius removed the ring on his finger, which symbolized his royal status. Having noticed that Thumbelina neither knew nor recognized what the ring represented he hadn't bothered removing it. He was glad he hadn't. \"Oh, I'll never forget you. Never.\" he continued and cheekily slipped the ring onto Thumbelina's left ring finger, knowing what such an action meant to humans. Also not failing to notice his actions, Thumbelina grew giddy inside. \"Never. Never.\" she whispered, leaning in for a kiss. \"Speak up.\" \"Never.\" Thumbelina whispered coming out of her daydream. She knew now why Cornelius' image haunted her this day. \"What?\" The priest asked surprised. He wondered if his hearing was playing tricks on him again. \"Never.\" Thumbelina reiterated louder. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I cannot marry Mr. Mole.\" At hearing a collective gasp from behind her, Thumbelina explained, \"I don't love him.\" Mr. Mole's eyes grew in surprise. \"What?\" He had been sure that she loved him. She had even agreed to the wedding! \"Thumbelina!\" cried Ms. Fieldmouse in outrage. It was at that very moment a certain toad crashed through the ceiling of the makeshift chapel. \"Yaah!\" \"You!\" shouted Thumbelina. Why now? Grundel gestured to himself, happily. \"I marry her.\" He was sure she had refused the mole to be with. He opened his arms wide anticipating her running into his arms. \"No!\" She cried instead. She threw her puny bouquet into the audience. \"I no marry you. I go home.\" Upset by her refusal after he wasted a whole season searching for her, Grundel pulled on her arm. \"No!\" \"Go away!\" Thumbelina kicked at his leg with all her power. She ran when Grundel let go to hold his aching leg. The audience gasped at the display of violence playing out in front of them. Mr. Mole scowled at the girl, upset at the turn of events. \"After her!\" he demanded. The organist played a dramatic tune as the bride ran away. He was secretly happy at the events as he was bored with having to see the same event over and over again. They rarely ever changed a beat. Thumbelina huffed as she ran down the corridor. She mentally shouted in despair at how heavy her dress was. She angrily pulled at the veil on her head as she felt it slip with each movement. She scowled as the beetle jumped in front of her. \"Ha ha! Hiya, toots!\" He grinned evilly and pulled her back by her veil as she ran past. \"I'm not your toots.\" She didn't stop to watch him fall as she removed the veil. \"Hey, wait!\" she heard from behind her. She ran faster when she heard the toad join in with a cry of her name. \"My wings! My wings!\" Beetle cried, even as first the toad and then the hoard of wedding guests trampled him. Fortunately, from a few feet up above away from her sight, her beloved prince came falling through a hole in the ceiling placed to let in some light for the guests. It was very fortunate, indeed, that Cornelius had recovered with enough time to find the mole's underground burrow. And likewise was it fortunate that the fairy prince was aware of where this 'Mr. Mole' generally resided in the Vale or else Cornelius might have found himself sobbing in despair as Thumbelina was whisked away to her honeymoon by another man. As it was, with the time ticking ever closer to the end of winter and not having any idea of exactly when the wedding was to take place, Cornelius used a great amount of his dust to create a spell - a spell which would remind Thumbelina of the last memory they shared together. Cornelius hoped this might delay the wedding until he was able to get there. It would work much better than he thought as he would come to find out later. But for now, as he tumbled into the rocky tunnel of the 'chapel' Cornelius was more focused on saving Thumbelina from marrying anyone but him. He lamented not ever telling her that he wasn't so easy to kill as a fairy. He breathed deeply as the wind was knocked out of him but gasped as he saw his beloved girl being chased by a hoard of creatures. \"Thumbelina...\" He scowled at hearing a toad shout, \"She marry me!\" \"That's the toad we've been telling you about!\" Is that so?, Cornelius thought as he jumped down to block its path. He took pleasure in the toad's shocked face as he pulled out his sword. \"We meet at last, Mr. Toad.\" \"Fairy prince? No!\" The toad shouted. He pulled a beetle next to him by his throat. \"You killed him.\" He punched at the beetle's head and growled. he grabbed the mole's torch as a weapon. Thumbelina was too focused on running to notice she wasn't being chased or that the voice of her 'late' almost-fiancé was coming from the same direction. So focused was she that she ran into some hanging cobweb and frustrated she pulled at the cobweb to create a path. Light up ahead caught her attention and she smiled when she realized it was natural. \"Oh...\" she moaned. \"The sun. The sun is shining again.\" Next door a battle waged on between her fairy prince and the toad as they each parried and launched with their respective weapon at each other. \"Ha!\" went Cornelius as he poked the toad's butt. \"Aah!\" \"Ha ha. Come on. Show me what you got.\" Cornelius mocked, but as it was only a few days ago that he recovered from his 'death' he was a little slow to react to the torch coming toward his head. He fell as the room rotated and the toad multiplied into three. The toad laughed as he threw away the prince's sword and batted away the Jitterbugs. Not giving up, the prince grabbed at the toad's ankle, unbalancing the amphibian. Cornelius had a hard time trying to stop the toad from hanging onto him. The rest of the wedding party hurried past at the first opportunity. \"Let me go!\" A scream came from the next room. \"Thumbelina!\" The distraction gave the toad the opportunity to grab the prince's head. They both fell down over the ledge. \"Aah!\" Thumbelina ran at the sight of the horde catching up to her. She scurried to run up the hill of jewels and gold and toward the light, not wanting and not able to find an actual door out of the place. She panted from the exercise of running, climbing, and lifting the dreadful dress up. \"Thumbelina, come back!\" Mr. Mole begged. Thumbelina grimaced and shivered at hearing that. Using a nearby key she moved it to cause an avalanche of jewels and gold, which thankfully cleared the path for her. She bit her lip when her mouth pulled involuntarily into a smile and looked back to see the result. She let her smile show when the wedding party ran in the opposite direction they were headed in. Among them, unnoticed was two of the Jitterbugs who flew back quickly to Prince Cornelius to update him on the situation. Settling next to Gnatty who they left behind to watch, they listened as he caught them up to the action. Apparently, the fall from the ledge proved to be an advantage for the fairy, the only one of the two with the ability to fly. On the way down, Cornelius had managed to kick the toad away from his person, which resulted in the toad getting a mighty fracture in his leg when he tried to stop his fall. Toads weren't very good at catching themselves it seemed. With the new impairment the toad wasn't so quick to leap back into the battle with as much vigor as he would've, and now without his torch, he was unable to block himself successfully from the sword Cornelius recovered. He got a nice long slash when he blocked it. Lunging at the prince resulted in a black eye to complete the look. \"Prince Cornelius! Thumbelina is leaving the tunnel!\" Li'l Bee told him, feeling that the fight was essentially over. \"What? She's leaving?\" Cornelius responded. He quickly hit the blunt end of his sword on the growling toad's head, effectively knocking him out. \"Show me where she went.\" \"O.K. Follow me!\" Li'l Bee gestured with his arm in the general direction. Grundel was unable to follow with his broke leg. ~0~ Thumbelina did not stay too long in the tunnel. She was quick to rip off the collar of the dress to scurry up the little hole above her. She didn't even care when the rock walls ripped her dress apart. She just focused on reaching the outside air to feel the warm rays of the sun heat up her skin, to feel the wind comb through her hair, to smell the natural scent that all forests emitted. She was desperate to see light cascade upon her unforgiving. \"Oh. The sun!\" She basked at her acquired freedom. Noise and a shadow coming from behind her had her turning. \"Follow your heart...\" finished the new comer. \"Jacquimo, it's you!\" Thumbelina gasped. Jacquimo laughed. \"Of course! C'est moi. Oh, Thumbelina. I found it. I have found it. I find the Vale of the Fairies!\" Jacquimo informed her, ecstatic. \"Oh, Jacquimo...\" Thumbelina shook her head at the news. It was too late now. \"No, no, listen. It is true.\" Jacquimo explained, misinterpreting her reluctance to mean that she didn't believe him. \"I talked to the rabbit, who talked to the fox, who talked to the deer, who know for sure. You see-uh, no, I show you. Jump on.\" \"No, no, Jacquimo!\" Thumbelina cried in surprise as Jacquimo picked her up and deposited her on his back. They flew off as Jacquimo began to hum. ~0~ Cornelius and the three Jitterbugs made it out of the same hole Thumbelina went through seconds after Jacquimo took off. As it was, all they saw from their location was a small dot in the distance with a stream of orange hair flying behind it. \"It's Jacquimo!\" Gnatty pointed out happily, somehow able to tell who it was. \"Jacquimo? Who is that?\" Cornelius asked, wondering how many people actually met Thumbelina during her little adventure. \"oh, don't you worry fairy prince! Jacquimo is Thumbelina's friend.\" Baby Bug replied as they took off in their direction. \"They're probably heading to the Vale of the Fairies right now! He's the one that helped Thumbelina escape from the toads.\" Cornelius relaxed a little at that. At least it wasn't another potential kidnapper. His poor Thumbelina already had had one too many as it was. But at the thought of how close he was to Thumbelina he grinned in anticipation. He would finally be reunited with his love. He only wished that Buzzby was around to fly him there. Animals were known to go faster when it came to long distance. ~0~ \"La la-la-la-la la la-la... We go find us a fairy prince.\" Jacquimo claimed. \"Oh, that's impossible.\" Thumbelina sighed, not caring that her hair was unraveling with the breeze. She didn't like it anyway. \"Ho ho. You are wrong.\" He informed her happily. Riding along for a few more minutes, Thumbelina giggled at what she escaped from. \"Jacquimo, I nearly made the biggest mistake of my life. (\"La la-la-la-la la la-la\") I nearly said yes to the mole.\" She told him as she stopped his hat from flying away. \"There's the mountain that looks like a turtle.\" he said out loud. \"But, well, I don't love the mole.\" She giggled with relief at being able to say it out loud without any pesky field-mouse around to put ideas of love being fake into her head. Jacquimo paid her no mind as he dove to a nearby valley and landed on an outstretched limb. Thumbelina bounced on his back. \"Ah. We are here. We are here.\" He put a hand to his mouth, barely noticing as Thumbelina slid from his back. \"Hello, hello, hello! Fairies!\" His voice echoed off the mountain walls. He looked upside down at Thumbelina. \"This is it.\" \"This?\" Thumbelina asked doubtfully from under the hat. \"It just looks like a patch of ordinary weeds.\" Jacquimo let her doubt bounce right off him. And knowing about how skittish the fairies can be when a stranger is close to their home, Jacquimo came up with the perfect plan to lure them out. \"Sing, Thumbelina, sing!\" Perhaps the fairies, who were known for their curiosity would come out from their hiding place. Thumbelina was not so positive. \"Oh, Jacquimo, please, can you take me home?\" Growing slightly annoyed with her, he demanded again, \"Oh, sing!\" Thumbelina sighed giving in. \"You will be my wings You will be my only love You will take me far beyond the stars... Jacquimo grinned as an icicle shattered next to him. \"Jacquimo, this is silly. This is a weed patch.\" Truly annoyed now, Jacquimo insisted, \"This is the Vale of the Fairies.\" He angrily stomped his foot and put on his hat. \"Take me home. Please.\" Thumbelina begged. Unwilling to comply, Jacquimo sang, \" Let me be your wings . Like that. Sing-like that.\" \"You will lift me high above... \"Oh, ho! Magnifique .\" Jacquimo laughed as ice shattered to reveal the beginning of buds protruding from plants. \"Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours...\" \"Ho, ho! Incroyable .\" Jacquimo waved his hat in triumph. \"Everything that we desire Anything at all Everyday you'll take me higher... Thumbelina sighed at the impossibility of this statement. \"Let's be practical. This isn't the Vale of the Fairies, and Cornelius is never coming back.\" \"...And I'll never let you fall.\" finished a familiar male voice behind her. Thumbelina turned shocked to see a picture of beauty. Strong, healthy, and very much alive her dear prince stood surrounded by falling ice and the Jitterbugs with the suns' rays illuminating his person. She felt her eyes fill with tears. \"You. It's you. Cornelius, you're alive!\" Thumbelina barely held in the urge to laugh loudly in relief and happiness. Cornelius didn't hold back his urge to run for her. He barely stopped himself from slamming into her. They didn't hold back as they embraced each other passionately almost as if they feared that letting each other go now meant that the other would be lost forever. Their lips met in a passionate kiss. Jacquimo flew to block the kids view, to which they protested vehemently. \"Oh, Cornelius...\" Thumbelina sighed into the kiss. Cornelius turned his head and bit at her lip. \"Cornelius, I thought I would never see you again.\" She clutched tighter at his shoulders. \"Thumbelina...\" Cornelius mumbled, giving her a big smooch. \"I never want to leave you again.\" He pulled back from their kiss to lift her into the air. \"Thumbelina, will you marry me?\" He smiled at her. She smiled softly. \"I will,\" she whispered as he brought her down to his lips. She giggled around his lips and he smiled. They pulled apart when they heard cheers coming from their audience. They grinned as the Jitterbugs plowed into them. \"Gnatty! Li'l Bee! Baby Bug! It's so great to see you again!\" \"Are you going to invite us to your wedding, Thumbelina?\" Gnatty asked. \"Of course I am! You are my friends!\" Thumbelina informed them, grabbing them into a big bear hug. Cornelius looked on happily, briefly imagining the day they would have a little one of their own. Jacquimo flew over, and unable to hold his excitement, shook the fairy prince's hand enthusiastically. \"Congratulations, mon amie ! You have found each other! Oh, I just love weddings. \" Cornelius had a hard time keeping his footing but when Jacquimo let him go abruptly, he laughed in merriment. \"Thank you, uh, sir...?\" Prince Cornelius left open, having forgotten what the Jitterbugs had called the swallow in his hurry to get to Thumbelina before something else happened to her. Overhearing his question, Thumbelina hurried over. \"Oh, Cornelius, this is Jacquimo he's the one who helped me escape from the toads. Jacquimo, this is Prince Cornelius.\" She gestured to each as she spoke. Taking off his hat and pressing it to his chest, Jacquimo bowed. \"Yes, c'est moi ! Oh, the fairy prince! We have looked for you everywhere!\" He smiled widely. Cornelius bowed back in turn. \"Oh yeah? Well, you've found me now and I am not letting her go for anything.\" Cornelius said cheekily, wrapping his arms around her waist and bringing her close. Thumbelina giggled. \"Thank you, Jacquimo, for saving her. I don't know what would have happened if you were not there.\" Jacquimo flapped his wings and placed his hat back. \"Oh, ho! Think nothing of it, fairy prince! I would never ignore a cry for help.\" Any further conversation was interrupted as the children could no longer hold in their excitement. \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina! Did you see? Did you see?\" Gnatty cried. Baby bug vigorously nodded his head. \"Yeah, the toad is never gonna bother you again!\" \"Nope! The prince sure got him good!\" Li'l Bee praised. \"Oh...\" Thumbelina giggled and looked at her love amused. She put a had to her lips Cornelius blushed slightly and gestured for them to settle down. \"Oh, no. Please, call me Cornelius.\" Ignoring his efforts to shush them, the children began the tale of how after the beetle took her they returned to their home only for the prince (\"Cornelius\") to show up asking for her and how he bravely went into the storm to look for her and how they went looking for her after only to see the beetle and the toad talking over Cornelius's body - It was trapped in ice, Thumbelina! - (\"I'll explain that later.\"). Then how they had to start a fire but all the wood was wet so they went back home and how their parents helped move the prince (\"Cornelius!\") to a safe place so they could wake him up. But then he didn't wake up 'cause he was sick and he had a fever! (\"Oh, Cornelius, are you okay?\" \"Yes\") And when you were running away from the toad today he went down there and fought him (\"You were there? Oh, no, I didn't see you!\"). The toad didn't know what was coming for him. He's probably still down there now! Thumbelina pressed her hands to her cheeks. \"Oh, my. Well, you were all very brave. Thank you for helping us along the way.\" \"You're welcome, Thumbelina.\" They cried simultaneously. Cornelius chuckled. \"Well, little ones. Why don't we leave the tourtereaux to themselves for now?\" The Jitterbugs let out sounds of disappointment at that. \"No, no. None of that, now.\" Jacquimo wiggled his fingers at them. \"Come with me. I will show you a mountain that looks like a turtle.\" He gestured to his back to which the children climbed on reluctantly. \"Your parents are probably worried about you.\" \"Goodbye, Thumbelina!\" \"Goodbye!\" \"See you later, Thumbelina!\" \"Goodbye, my friends!\" Thumbelina shouted happily as she waved at the retreating swallow and his entourage. She bounced on the balls of her feet and squealed when she was roughly turned and pulled into a masculine chest. \"Why don't we get out here? Huh?\" whispered his voice into her ear before he dropped a kiss to her shoulder. Thumbelina laughed breathily. \"Ok...\" Pulling back, Cornelius grinned and took to the air with his beloved finally back in his arms. Clutching at his shoulders, Thumbelina looked around at the passing scenery, amazed at the melting snow and the green that peaked through the white landscape. Only now that she was back with her prince did she truly enjoy the view presented to her. Sure she had felt safe with Jacquimo early but she was still wrapped up with finding her way home to truly take a look around and just bask in all that nature had to offer. She breathed deeply, her smile never leaving her face, as they flew into a small cavern in the side of the mountain. Reluctant to let her go once they touched ground, Cornelius kept his arms around Thumbelina and pulled her into another kiss as they sank to the ground. They kissed passionately for the next few minutes as they expressed their relief at finding the other and their happiness for their new found engagement. They pulled apart only when the need for oxygen demanded they do so. \"The next time I have to leave, I want you to come with me.\" Cornelius informed her as they puffed for breathe. Thumbelina tilted her head at him, relaxing her arms around his neck.\"Oh? And what would your mother say about that?\" She smirked lightly. Cornelius scoffed. \"Mother? Probably lecture me about getting distracted from my duties.\" He leaned his forehead on hers. \"I don't care about that. I'm not leaving you alone anymore.\" He rubbed his hand down her arms. \"I didn't know what to think when I found your room ransacked and you nowhere around.\" Thumbelina held back some tears. \"Oh, Cornelius, I was so scared. I woke up to some toads wanting me in their show and Mrs. Toad telling me I had to marry her son! And I don't know how to swim so I couldn't escape! But Jacquimo was there to save me. I don't know what I would have done if he wasn't.\" Thumbelina took a shuddering breath. \"And eventually finally myself in the hands on Ms. Fieldmouse who told me you were dead-\" She hugged him tightly. \"Oh, Cornelius, I'm so glad you're alive!\" He dropped a kiss on her lips. \"I'm sorry, Thumbelina. I never did tell you much about fairies.\" He proceeded to inform her of just how he was able to survive being frozen, as their bodies worked differently from humans, and Thumbelina listened closely in amazement. \"This was my fault. If I had told you sooner maybe you wouldn't have almost married the mole.\" He frowned as he rubbed her cheek. Thumbelina shook her head. \"I couldn't marry the mole. I didn't love him.\" She held the hand on her cheek. Cornelius smiled and gave her a butterfly kiss as he said huskily, \"I love you.\" She blushed. \"I love you too, Cornelius.\" They kissed some more. Sometime later, they found themselves contently gazing at the slowly departing sun as they leaned against each other and played with the other's hand. Cornelius sighed happily as he laid his head on top of Thumbelina's. She hummed in response. And suddenly remembering something he learned from his travel to the south, Cornelius tilted her head to look into her eyes. \"Hey, do you-do you still wish to have your own wings?\" Thumbelina frowned puzzled. \"What-Why, yes, I do. Why do you ask?\" \"If I were to tell you that you could, would you accept?\" Thumbelina's face showed surprise. \"But-But that's impossible.\" Cornelius smirked. \"Not so impossible. See, I didn't know how to do it but when I went to the south I took lessons in how to turn others into fairies.\" Cornelius' smirk turned into a wide smile at her shocked face. \"I can give you wings, Thumbelina.\" \"Wings...\" she breathed out. \"Really?\" she whispered hopeful. He hummed in response. \"Is that a yes?\" He tightened his hold on her. She threw her arms around his neck in excitement. \"Yes! Yes, Cornelius. Of course.\" She kissed his face all over earning a chuckle from him. She pulled away abruptly. \"What do you have to do?\" He leaned into her face, \"I'll show you,\" and promptly placed an open mouthed kiss on her lips. Thumbelina's eyes widened when she felt his tongue enter her mouth but shut her eyes seconds later, kissing him back. Her eyes opened again when she felt warmth shoot through her body unexpectedly. She tried to pull back instinctively but Cornelius tightened his hold and rubbed his hands up and down her body soothingly, though his motions had another purpose which was for him to feel if stubs sprang up on her back. When they did, Thumbelina moaned in pain. She scrunched her eyes tightly and leaned heavily upon her fiancé, who pulled back now that he did all he had to do. Apparently the process dictated that the one performing the spell have a pure desire for the non-fairy to become one, and for the non-fairy to want to be one in turn. Once the desire was innate, for the spell to take place the non-fairy had to ingest some fairy dust into their body. Of course, this could have been done by simply mixing fairy dust with a drink but Cornelius just had to put his own twist to the spell. Looking on as Thumbelina sprung two beautiful fairy wings of her own on her back, Cornelius mentally praised himself on a job well done. But he shifted his attention to his girl as she breathed deeply through the diminishing pain. \"Are you okay, Thumbelina?\" Thumbelina hummed. \"Yes.\" she responded once the pain went away completely. When she felt Cornelius rubbing at the base of said wings, she pulled away and looked back. \"Wings.\" she gasped. \"I have wings. My very own wings!\" She exclaimed happily. She jumped slightly as they flapped. Cornelius chuckled at that. \"I'll teach you how to control that later.\" He turned her face back to his by her chin. \"Are you happy?\" \"Oh, Cornelius, you have no idea. Thank you!\" She hugged him fiercely. ~0~ There was much rejoicing in the Vale of the Fairies, for not only the return of their prince, but for the news of their future princess having been found. With spring roaring upon the land, out of every flower came a lady and a gentleman and each one wanted to personally meet the dame who so captivated the heart of the wayward prince. (7) Even the King and Queen managed to get their heart stolen by the sweet and beautiful girl presented to them. As was a certain human when she was presented with both her lost daughter and her newfound beau. Thumbelina's mother had never shed as much happy tears as she did the day her daughter flew - flew! - right into her kitchen crying for her. She was so happy at seeing her daughter alive and well in front of her that she barely noticed the wings she sported or the male that followed her until Hero came running in, barking happily at the couple. Having not been aware of her daughter's late night meetings with the fairy prince, the old woman was pleasantly surprised at both the existence of fairies and the announcement of their impending marriage. She had to sit down in a nearby chair as they recounted the story of how that had come to pass. After she had thoroughly scolded Thumbelina for her secret trysts, to which Cornelius and her apologized profusely for their silence, she had given them her blessing. She was an active participant in their wedding when it came to pass in her garden at the end of spring. She happily tore up some of her blossoms to throw petals onto the runway as her daughter and her new husband walked back down the aisle. \"Hello, mother!\" She waved at her daughter happily. My, did her daughter look beautiful. Anything that you desire Anything at all Thumbelina giggled as she waved back. Cornelius bowed at his new mother-in-law before holding out his hand to Thumbelina. Bowing his head to a few guests nearby, he began to glide with his wife down to where a carriage awaited them. Every day I'll take you higher And I'll never let you fall... Not that Cornelius planned on using the royal carriage. He whistled to call for his most trusted steed. He could almost feel his parents' cringe as Buzzby picked them up right before they reach the carriage. He waved back at them happily. His parents let it go just the once. The Jitterbugs gave each other a high five at that. They were the ones tasked with making sure Buzzby was nearby. Thumbelina turned back before they got too far away and tossed her bouquet to no one in particular. It was just pure coincidence that Jacquimo flew right in its direction to wave goodbye at them with his hat. \" Au revoir !\" The bouquet fell right onto his head and into his hat. \"Oh! Ha ha...\" He picked it up with amused triumph. The couple smiled widely at that. He deserved to get a happy ending. Waving goodbye at him, Thumbelina turned when she felt Cornelius' arms around her waist. They gave each other their second kiss of the night. And always follow your heart... ~0~ \"And, of course... they lived happily ever after.\" The End ~0~ A/N: Some passages were inspired by or are direct copies of the actual text written by Hans Christian Andersen's \"Thumbelina.\" (I do not claim ownership of these.) They are as follows: (1) \"Now, being pleased with Thumbelina, she said: \"If you like, you can stay with me the whole winter, but you must keep my room clean and neat, and tell me tales, for I am very fond of them.\" And Thumbelina did what the good old field-mouse wished, and in return was treated uncommonly well.\" (2) \"Thumbelina had to sing, and she sang: \"Cockchafer, cockchafer, fly away,\" and \"When the parson goes afield.\" So the mole fell in love with her because of her beautiful voice: but he said nothing, for he was a prudent man.\" (3) \"But at night Thumbelina could get no sleep; so she got up from her bed and wove a fine large carpet of hay, which she carried along, and spread out over the dead bird. She also laid the tender stamina of flowers, which were soft as cotton, and which she had found in the field-mouse's room, around the bird, so that he might lie warm.\" (4) [Exact excerpt from the text] (5) \"Thumbelina had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired four spiders to weave for her day and night. Every evening the mole used to visit them, and was always saying that at the end of the summer the sun would not shine so warm by a long way, that it was burning the earth as hard as stone. Yes, when the summer was over he would celebrate his marriage with Thumbelina. But the latter was not at all pleased, for she could not bear the tiresome mole.\" (6) \"'Fiddlesticks! said the field-mouse; \"Don't be obstinate, or I will bite you with my white teeth. He is a fine man whom you are going to marry. The Queen herself has not such black velvety fur. He has a full kitchen and cellar. Be thankful for it!'\" (7) \"And out of every flower came a lady and a gentleman, so dainty that they were a pleasure to behold...There was much rejoicing, and the little swallow sat up in his nest, and was to sing the bridal song; this he did as well as he could, although in his heart he was sad, for he was so fond of Thumbelina, and would have liked never to separate himself from her.\" ","Summary":" A Tale of Little People ~0~ An old wind mind whirls at the slight breeze.

She soon grew so lonely she asked for a spell from a white witch. Hearing the wise woman's tale the white witch took pity and gave her a single seed, a single tiny seed. \" Take care of this seed, and place it under moon light , water it and you shall have you wish.\" The wise woman rushed home and planted the seed in a small pot and as soon as the moon had shone through the sky she watered the plant,and as she did it grew a large stalk and a beautiful red rose at the end of it. \"What a beautiful flower,\"the wise woman said as she kissed the top of the flower. As her lips left the flower it opened and revealed a small girl with (h/c) hair and (e/c) in a blue skirt and white top. The wise woman immediately fell in love with her and called her. \"Thumblelina, shall be you name.\" \"Thumbelina, I like that name.\" Said the girl only the side of a thumb. Even thought she was so small she still helped on the farm. Thumbelina had many talents but the one she was most praised for was her ability to the animals on her farm loved her, even though every day was a hassle for her.

Hours turned to days. Days turned to weeks. Weeks blended into the never-ending white. White, which stood up and around and around and around until color was almost forgotten. White, which crawled its way down to the bone, which bared and exposed all the underlying ignorance, all the unattainable skills for survival. Winter had come too soon. Winter was impossible to escape now. It had descended unforgivingly onto the land, harsher, almost to highlight its displeasure with recent events. Yet, adding to it. Thumbelina couldn't recall a winter as harsh as this. Of course, it could very well be due to her being in the gist of it. Never had she been outside during the winter season. Always snug and cozy in her little blankets, sitting on her mother's shoulder or nose, Thumbelina had never had any desire to wonder out into the yard to have the chilling wind knock her off her feet. Yet, here she was, unwillingly crawling through the frozen Earth, lost and bewildered, hoping to spot a familiar face – a kind one – yet not wishing them to suffer the same misery bestowed upon her. Winter had come too soon. Thumbelina no longer had control over her body. How could she, when the cold has taken refuge in her skin and left her turned inside out, exposed to the elements? It shivered against her will, protesting over her environment. She wondered how she was going to make it out. Oh, how she wished Cornelius would miraculously fly by, calling for her, to embrace her and warm her and take her back home to her mother. It had been weeks since she had last seen him. Her only comfort now was she that she had not lost the ring he had bestowed upon her their last night together. She rubbed her cheek on it to feel a sense of closeness with her beloved, but ended up flinching at the piercing cold of the gold. She missed his warmth. ~0~ He couldn't blame his father. He couldn't blame his mother either. He had been asking a lot when he implored them to hold off the winter frost for as long as possible. And while they had been able to hold it off for a day, he knew fairies were born to aid Mother Earth, not compete with her. No, he couldn't blame them. But he could blame himself. Sure, he wasn't the one to take his beloved from her home, nor was he the one to strand Thumbelina in this never-ending sea of frozen water, but he was the one to expose her to the occupants of the forest, to the ones who would forcibly whisk her away from all she had known. He knew that as the crown prince he shouldn't have been so frivolous and carefree in where he took his Thumbelina. After all, anyway who was discontent with the current fairy rulers would find any method to get back at the royals, and keeping the little human girl the prince had fallen for hostage was a good opportunity for them to do so, even if she wasn't the prince's fiancé as of yet, unlike what the rumors claim. Oh yes, he knew the rumors all too well. He cringed upon first learning of them. Not because it was partly untrue – he wished it was all true already! – but that he had wanted his proposal to be a surprise for Thumbelina. He hoped she hadn't heard them yet. He smirked to himself at the irony of his thoughts. Just a month – no, a week – before meeting Thumbelina he had scoffed at the idea of settling down with a future Queen when his parents suggested the idea. But look at him now, worrying over whether his princess had heard some flimsy rumors. There were more important issues to worry about. Like this blasted winter that had come too soon . \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina, can you hear me?\" He called, desperate to find her before the frost threatened to freeze him into an icicle. \"Thumbelina!\" He grunted went a particularly strong gust of wind threatened to blow them off course. Out of reflex, he tightened his hands around Buzzby's antennae, which had the bumble buzzing in protest. Cornelius loosened his hold. \"I'm sorry, Buzz.\" He had to lean forward to the bumble's head so his voice wasn't lost to the wind. Not that it mattered as the wind shifted direction again and threw back in the direction they were originally going in. Cornelius and Buzzby took advantage of this for the few minutes it was in their favor, before it shifted again. Cornelius grit his teeth and called out \"Don't worry, Buzz. We're going to make it!\" encouragingly to the bumble, although a grand measure of doubt failed to ease its grip on the fairy prince's mind. His worry wasn't unwarranted as they accidently flew through an obstacle in their path and he made the mistake of looking back to see what it is instead of where they were going. Without his passenger helping him steer, Buzzby soon lost control of his flight and both he and his cargo plummeted into the frozen land below. Buzzby was lucky enough to get stuck in a bank of snow, but Cornelius wasn't having the best day it seemed as a snowball hit his back and he plummeted into the icy waters of a pond. It was a good thing fairies didn't always rely on flight as he oriented himself and started swimming for the surface. It was a difficult task. The water was frozen over yet but it certainly wasn't completely fluid either. It was thick and dense, and he could feel heavy resistance against his limbs. His wings were stiff, his eyeballs burned from the water, his hair felt heavy on his head. He also felt like a thousand knives were pricking at his skin, it was so cold. His hearing was dull, his clothes were an uncomfortable wrapping, and his sword proved to be an annoying asset at this moment. He could feel the pressure of the water settling in to his bones. It swirled around his neck like a ring of death. His limbs didn't stroke as much anymore. The water wasn't as fluid anymore. The prickling knives ceased to poke but instead just held themselves there. His movement slowed more and more. It felt like eternity before his finger breeched the surface, followed by his wrist, his arm, head, shoulder, torso, leg, his other leg as the water grew denser and denser until it was a solid wall encasing his left foot, unwilling to let go of its first winter victim. Cornelius grit his teeth at his uncomfortable predicament. Buzzby, now having shaken off the snow preventing his flight, buzzed around the captured form of his master. \"You have got to be kidding me!\" Cornelius growled in frustration, as he flung out his sword and began hacking at the ice around his foot. He barely made a dent with his first strike. He channeled fairy dust into the sword and tried again. A chip. He sighed sharply. It was going to be a while. Two hours later and the fairy prince's arms felt like rubber. He had gotten most of the ice chipped away but his arms barely had the will to raise and strike again. The sole of his foot was still stuck in the ice. Right as Cornelius was going to cry out in anger, Buzzby – his ever faithful companion – nudged his head. The bumble lowered its head, indicating his antennae when the prince turned to look. It only took a second for the prince to understand what his friend was saying. Using all his might to fling his hands onto the antennae, the fairy prince grit his teeth as the bumble flapped his wings as fast as possible. He flapped his own in an effort to help, and it seemed as if their efforts paid off as Cornelius' foot popped out of the ice and he went stumbling onto the ice face first. Cornelius groaned at the pain and sat up, clutching his nose. Eager to get his mistress back so they could return to the warmth of the Vale, Buzzby pushed against the prince's back, which flung him haphazardly onto the bumble. They took off once again. After righting himself and rubbing his nose for a bit, Cornelius resumed his mission of calling for his lady. Having lost his helmet in the tumble from earlier, he had to shield his eyes using his arm. He shivered. \"Thumbelina, where are you? Thumbelina!\" ~0~ Even if it was an annoyance, it was a very good thing Cornelius got delayed at the frozen pond for not far away now was the very lady he has been looking for. She thought she had found a site of haven when she found the little tree truck cavern. She saw a roof, a tree trunk on two sides, and some darkness signifying it was a long tavern. Unfortunately, it was a straight and true route, meaning the openings on either side created a steady and freezing draft that cut sharply into Thumbelina the moment she stepped close to it. She shuddered violently at the blast of cold air and whimpered. It wasn't what she thought it was but with no other route around, she grit her teeth and dashed through it. She still couldn't figure out where she was, so she trekked on in a vain hope that she could spot her mother's house in the distance. She didn't see the puddle fast enough. Thumbelina gasped as the half-frozen water seeped into the folds of her dress and embraced her skin below. She coughed immediately after as the cold air harshly moved down her throat and chilled her insides. She dropped onto the snow next to the puddle and shivered violently. She would've cried had she been able to produce any tears. Thumbelina couldn't help but wonder if she would ever be able to find her way home. \"….na!\" Thumbelina didn't immediately react as the wind whistling through could have made the sound. But the sound came again a second later. \"….lina!\" Thumbelina looked around frantically. \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" She shouted before coughing. \"…belina!\" There was definitely someone there. \"Hello?! Cornelius?! Is that you? Hello!\" \"…you? Thumbelina!\" Thumbelina jumped up and started searching the sky. \"I'm here! Cornelius? Anybody? I'm right here!\" She started jumping around despite her feet getting soaked with the snow, before spotting an old shoe on a hill and deciding that a little elevation might help her. She continued shouting as she hiked to the shoe. ~0~ \"….nelius!...ov…ere! Cor…lius!\" Cornelius' head shot up as the sweetest voice he ever heard cut through the unforgiving winter gust. \"Thumbelina? Thumbelina, is that you?! Where are you?\" \"O…here! Cornelius!\" came the voice from his right. Cornelius didn't even have to prompt Buzzby over to the voice, before he was already coming upon his sweetheart. \"Cornelius!\" she cried out in relief, with a huge grin on her face. Cornelius could almost cry in relief too. \"Thumbelina, I found you! I'm never letting you out of my sight again!\" He proclaimed, shooting off of Buzzby in order to twirl around his love. Thumbelina laughed cheerfully, before Cornelius' mouth covered her lips. Thumbelina was surprised but eagerly reciprocated and pulled him close. She shuddered at the feel of his warm chest pressed against her own, creating a sharp contrast against the biting cold against her back. Cornelius' felt the shudder too, and the cold-water enveloping Thumbelina's form, so pulled back. \"We need to get you out of here.\" Thumbelina nodded as Cornelius picked her up and settled her on Buzzby, her back to his front, and sighed contently. Feeling safe, her eyes started drooping. She blinked fiercely trying to remain awake now that she had Cornelius to keep her company but she lost the battle soon after. When he spotted his beloved and had her in his arms, tension had left the fairy princes body. He had his girl, she was safe, and they both could finally escape the winter frost. However, a new tension was stiffening his body as he just started noticing just how gray the world looked now. Gray and white blended together to make a disorienting combo that would throw any weary traveler off. There was nothing to see for miles around. The only thing Cornelius could see nearby were the trees and the banks of snow littering the ground. \"We have to find shelter, Buzzby! We're going to have to wait for morning!\" Buzzby buzzed in agreement and they booked it out of there, searching for any kind of shelter. It was difficult though. Not only was every crevice covered with snow or frozen over, but the very air they breathed continued to pelt them with snowballs which they had to dodge frantically. Feeling Thumbelina slipping out of his arms, Cornelius looked down and cursed at seeing her unconscious form. \"Wake up, Thumbelina!\" She was too cold for his liking. \"Don't do this to me, Thumbelina!\" He shook her a little, \"Thumbelina!\" No response. Cornelius grit his teeth and tried to keep his mind focused on getting out of the blizzard. He gasped and dodged a low hanging branch. He didn't make the mistake of looking back this time. He tightened his grip on his sweetheart and began searching frantically for shelter. He tried and almost failed at keeping his mind sharp and positive until salvation arrived. Spotting a pile of rocks, Cornelius guided his bumble close to it and – while not the best shelter – deemed it suitably enough for their purposes. He was quick to make his unconscious future bride comfortable in the meager dwelling. Feeling her face, he crinkled his eyebrows in worry at feeling no warmth seeping from her skin. Looking around he spotted some twigs on the ground and hastily went to work collecting all the twigs and piling them close to Thumbelina. Grabbing a pebble and pulling out his sword, Cornelius sent a mental thanks to his father for making him learn how to make a fire as he tried to ignite a flame on the makeshift fire pit. It took a few tries but Cornelius sighed in relief when the first signs of smoke began wafting to his face. He held his breath when the flame wavered for a moment before it got stronger. He was quick to return to Thumbelina. \"Oh Thumbelina…\" Cornelius sighed when he moved to shift her closer to the fire and felt her trembling form. He frantically rubbed at her arms and hugged her form. \"Please, please warm up Thumbelina. You need to wake up for me, please.\" He muttered to her. A few minutes later, she was still trembling. She also started perspiring. \"Oh dear. Oh no, oh no.\" What should I do? How do I warm her – oh. Glancing down at her wet clothes, Cornelius blushed. He glanced at Buzzby almost looking for guidance but saw the bumblebee looking away, already snoozing. Shaking his head a little, Cornelius bit his lip and threw caution to the wind. Come on, boy. Thumbelina's life is in danger! Still, keeping a sense of propriety, Cornelius made sure to keep his eyes only on his fingers as they unbuttoned the back of Thumbelina's dress and most definitely not on Thumbelina's smooth milky bare ba- Focus! Cornelius grimaced as he pulled her dress away as quickly as possible, making sure to look at the rock wall, before turning around and laying her dress to dry next to the fire. He stood up on his knees and took off his top. It was made of various fabrics and patting the inside proved that it was not completely soaked through. He turned and spread the jacket across her back like a blanket before lying down next to her. He gathered her up and swallowed at feeling skin to skin contact. Oh dear, she's not wearing any-Leave it for the wedding! Cornelius dropped his head onto Thumbelina's shoulder and sighed deeply. Now was not the time for him to be thinking of Thumbelina's state of undress. She was definitely showing signs of fever now. He hoped his above normal-for-humans body temperature could help warm her up until morning. Cornelius wouldn't get any sleep that night. Not just because he had to keep watch over Thumbelina, who was suffering the effects of being out in the snow with only a flimsy dress made for autumn – which was a big part of the reason – but because Thumbelina's little puffs of air were tickling his neck and running down his chest in a very pleasant way and there was no way he was going to be able to go to sleep with that sensation distracting him. Cornelius sighed and prayed for morning. ~0~ Surprisingly, Cornelius' eyes opened when he felt sunshine upon his face. He had fallen asleep at some point that night. It seems the cold was affecting him too. He shifted a little to relieve some ache in his body and smiled when he heard Thumbelina mumble into his neck. The smile turned into a frown when he looked down and saw her flushed face. Placing his hand on her forehead, Cornelius grimaced at how hot her skin was now. \"Buzzby,\" Cornelius hissed, looking toward his loyal companion. No response. \"Buzzby, wake up. It's morning we need to go to Thumbelina's mother.\" Slight stirring from the bumblebee. \"Buzzby!\" Cornelius screamed in a whisper, finally getting the attention of his friend, though he had to rub Thumbelina's back when she mumbled and shifted slightly. \"Come on, we have to go.\" Buzzby buzzed. \"I promise we're going someplace warmer. Trust me.\" Buzzby flailed his antennae in acquiesce. \"Ok, good.\" Cornelius smiled, pulling back to sit up, forgetting momentarily how he had to undress Thumbelina and receiving an eyeful accidently. He looked away sharply, blushing slightly, and adjusted his top over her body. Picking up her dress, he was grateful at seeing it dry – if not a little wrinkled and torn up – as he had no other clothes to give Thumbelina at the moment. He imagined Thumbelina's mother wouldn't be too happy if some boy she didn't know showed up with her unconscious and barely clothed daughter. Redressing her again proved to be another battle with his eyes as the morning light revealed a few more contours of her body that he couldn't see the night before. As it was, he got a bit distracted when his fingers accidently grazed her back and he unconsciously caressed the skin for a few seconds more, his eyes fixed on that one spot, until a buzz brought his mind back to order. He was quick to finish after that. Pulling his own top on, Cornelius hastily covered the fire pit with some dirt using his foot before bending down and picking up Thumbelina delicately. Hoping not to jostle her out of sleep, Cornelius chose to fly with her onto Buzzby and made sure she was comfortably positioned before signaling Buzzby to take off. Once outside and slightly high in the sky, Cornelius sighed in relief at seeing that that day was much calmer and clearer than the previous. In fact, as Buzzby flew higher Cornelius let out a \"Yes!\" at spotting Thumbelina's house not too far off. He laughed in glee. At least the winter frost wasn't entirely against them if it drove them this close to her home. ~0~ In the same dwelling currently being stalked by a fairy prince and a bumblebee, one could hear the occasional clanging of pots and cutlery coming from the kitchen. If one paid closer attention, one could also hear the occasional sniffles coming from the person doing the cooking and an answering whimper from the old guard dog resting by the doorway. One could also not help but notice the oppressive silence coming from all around the property. The silence was loud to Thumbelina's mother's ears. It had been months since her house had been missing the sounds of conversations and childish mutterings. Thumbelina had brought a light to the property when she left her little flower that day. There wasn't one morning that passed where Thumbelina couldn't be found asking her mother all about her days from before her existence or about the recipes being used for breakfast or even just slight humming as both ladies harmonized to a nice bedtime hymn. The missing status of the little flower girl had hit everyone at the house hard. Hero no longer ran around in excitement, for he was ashamed that he couldn't have helped poor little Thumbelina when that disgusting toad woman took her. The farm animals no longer sang or did much of anything but drink, eat, and sleep. Mother went about her chores with half her mind far away with her daughter. The first thought she had upon waking was about the whereabouts of her daughter and the last thought of the day was whether her daughter was safe and warm. She had no way of knowing that her daughter was approaching fast in the arms of a fairy boy until said fairy boy, upon his transported, quite literally crashed into the window of her daughter's room. She almost jumped out of her skin when she heard the bang before literally running up the stairs with Hero yapping at her heel. Quickly opening her daughter's bedroom door, Thumbelina's mother looked around franticly to see what had made the noise until Hero directed her attention to the window with his barking. \"Oh my goodness!\" She breathed out when she noticed the fairy rubbing at the head of the bumblebee he sat upon. It seems that the force of their crash was enough to slam the window closed, which was the source of the noise. Seeing something blue moving in the fairy's arms, Thumbelina's mother looked closer before crying out and hurrying to let them in. \"Thumbelina! Sweetheart!\" The fairy prince and bumblebee were quick to look up at her. When she swung the window open, the fairy boy wasted no time in flying over to the crib to let go of his precious cargo. \"How is she? Is she okay?\" Thumbelina's mother asked, not really caring exactly who it was that brought Thumbelina home. \"She has a fever, Mrs… Madam. She was freezing last night. I tried my best to warm her up until the weather cleared.\" Cornelius said, brushing away some hair off Thumbelina's forehead. \"I fear she has a fever.\" \"Oh dear. I'll be right back. Stay here, Hero.\" Cornelius didn't look up as he continued to caress Thumbelina's face. He barely even looked up when Hero placed his two front legs on the crib to get a better look at his younger mistress. A few minutes later, Thumbelina's mother came back in carrying a small wash cloth and a cup of water. \"She needs to be washed down,\" she commented, setting the materials on the table. Cornelius looked up at that. \"I'll do it.\" Thumbelina's mother turned to him sharply. \"What? I'll be doing the washing.\" \"It will be easier for me to do it.\" \"That's improper! How do you even know my daughter?\" Cornelius smiled and looked back to Thumbelina. \"I hope to marry her.\" \"Oh!\" Thumbelina's mother was surprised. \"What is your name?\" \"Cornelius.\" \"How long have you known my daughter?\" \"I met Thumbelina on the windowsill the night she taken.\" Thumbelina's mother's eyebrows rose. \"You wouldn't happen to know about that, would you?\" Cornelius frowned. \"All I know is what I heard from Hero, that a toad had taken her from here. I looked for her for days and only found her on accident.\" Cornelius shook his head and grit his teeth. \"I heard she was being chased by one. If I ever find that toad I'm gonna-\" Rough coughing interrupted his voiced threat and both their attentions diverted to the sickly girl. \"She still needs to be washed down and she has to change that dress. It's not suitable for this weather.\" She looked at Cornelius, who gazed back at her frowning. \"Son, you can't be in here for that.\" Cornelius shook his head. \"I'm not leaving her. The last time I did she got kidnapped.\" But meeting her halfway he flew to the window and sat with his back to the females. \"I won't look,\" he promised. Thumbelina's mother sighed but went to work. A few seconds after the sound of dripping water stopped and the sound of clothes rustling started, a slight groan could be heard, followed by \"Mother?\", causing Cornelius to stiffen and forcibly stop himself from turning around. \"Shhh, Thumbelina. Shhh. You're safe at home.\" Thumbelina's mother told her, smiling in relief. \"Oh.\" Thumbelina muttered, her eyes fluttering as her head turned side to side. \"Cornelius?\" \"I'm here, Thumbelina. Go back to sleep.\" Cornelius piped up. Not fighting his advice, Thumbelina fell back to a fitful sleep. Two days later, Cornelius woke up to the wonderful discovery that Thumbelina's fever broke sometime in the night and her face was smoothed out with peace. He smiled at her and kissed her forehead affectionately, choosing to stay lying next to her a few minutes more before he went down to join Thumbelina's mother. He found her preparing the recipes for a loaf of bread down in the kitchen. He took a seat lotus style on a table away from her and just watched for a few moments, before calling out a greeting. \"Good morning, madam!\" Thumbelina's mother smiled at him. \"Good morning, Cornelius. How is Thumbelina doing?\" Grabbing hold of his ankles, Cornelius rocked a little. \"She's better. Sleeping. Her fever broke sometime last night, so I hope she's up and about tonight.\" \"That's wonderful. I've never seen my little girl so sick before. She gave me a fright.\" Thumbelina's mother sighed sadly. Watching her for a moment, Cornelius frowned thoughtfully. \"Madam-\" \"Oh dear, you can call me Maman . You can get some practice for when you marry Thumbelina.\" Thumbelina's mother said cheekily. Cornelius lightly blushed. \"I haven't asked her yet,\" he muttered, looking down. \"Dearie, if she's as in love with you as you are of her, she'll say yes.\" \"Thank you, mada- Maman ,\" Cornelius smiled shyly. \"What were you going to ask me, son?\" \"Oh yes, well. I was wondering how a human as big as you had a human as small as Thumbeli-Wait! That didn't come out correctly. I mean, how did-\" Thumbelina's mother laughed lightly. \"It's all right, son. I understand.\" Beginning to knead the dough, Thumbelina's mother continued, \"I didn't give birth to Thumbelina if that's what you are wondering.\" \"You adopted her?\" \"Not exactly.\" Giving the dough one last hit, Thumbelina's mother began folding the dough into shape. \"You see, I had always dreamed of having children to tell stories to, to play with, to sing to. But I was never able to have children. When my husband passed, I had this whole farm to myself and no one to share it with. I longed to have a child to call my own so I paid a visit to a good witch I knew from my courting days and she gave me a barleycorn. She told me to plant it and when a flower bloomed, between the petals was my darling girl.\" She smiled. Cornelius frowned thoughtfully again. \"A barleycorn?\" He could feel a little flutter in his memories about something to do with barleycorn but the memory was escaping him. He filed the information for later. \"So how exactly did you meet my daughter, Cornelius? You never elaborated.\" Cornelius laughed. \"Pure coincidence! I was on Buzzby, my bumble, trying to get away from my parents and I heard the most beautiful voice. I followed it and found Thumbelina dancing and singing on the windowsill. I went in, we talked, and then I took Thumbelina around the Val – meadow where we danced and sang.\" Going down memory lane the way he was, two and two got put together and he suddenly gasped and stood up. \"The toad! We passed by a traveling toad show that night! Oh no!\" He stomped his foot and hung his head. \"This is my fault! They would have never known about Thumbelina if I never took her out that night!\" Thumbelina's mother shook her head. \"You couldn't have known, dear. Now I don't know what Thumbelina went through out there in the cold but what matters is that you searched for her and found her. She's safe now in her bed and it's all because of you.\" Cornelius shook his head. \"She wouldn't have been out there in the first place if I hadn't taken her to the toads.\" He flopped down in shame. \"The way I see it, you didn't lead them to Thumbelina's window that night. No. Choosing to search for her and kidnap her was all on the toad.\" She smiled at him. \"You can't control what other people do, Cornelius. You can only control what you do, and choosing to search for Thumbelina through this horrible winter is a big plus in my book. I'm positive Thumbelina won't blame you either.\" Right as Cornelius' mouth opened to comment, Hero pounced down the steps barking excitedly. Cornelius flew up hurriedly as Thumbelina's mother straightened up. \"What happened, Hero? Is it Thumbelina?\" Hero barked at him and wagged his tail. \"She's awake?\" Cornelius exclaimed happily. \"Thumbelina!\" he cried out, flying to her room with Thumbelina's mother walking briskly behind him. Upstairs, sitting up and looking around tiredly, sat Thumbelina, who was slightly disoriented as to what was going on. She clearly remembered being found by Cornelius out in the snow, and she vaguely got an impression of being taken somewhere on Buzzby, but she couldn't quite remember when they had gotten to her mother's house. Either way, she was happy finally being home. She grew even happier when Cornelius burst in through the door and barely held back from ramming into her with a hug. \"You're awake!\" He cried out, before smacking lips with her. He pulled away and held her face in his hands. \"Don't you ever do that to me again.\" \"Do what?\" She asked, a little breathless. \"You've been asleep for two days, sweetie.\" Turning to see her mother in the doorway, Thumbelina squealed and tried to stand up. Thumbelina's mother laid her hand down in front of her to lift her. \"Mother! Mother, I've missed you,\" Thumbelina cried out, hugging her mother's thumb as she was brought up to her mother's eye line. Thumbelina's mother's eyes crinkled at the corners as her smile grew. \"Oh, Thumbelina. I've missed you too, baby girl. I'm glad you're ok now,\" she said lovingly. And having a burst of mischief, said: \"We must thank Cornelius over there for bringing you back. He's been such a gentleman.\" Cornelius flew onto her hand hearing his name and smiled at Thumbelina. Remembering that her mother hadn't met her beau yet, Thumbelina hurried to explain. \"Oh, Mother, I can explain…\" \"No need, Thumbelina. Cornelius explained it all to me. I'm happy you both found each other. Although, I'm not happy with you leaving without telling me, Thumbelina. We'll have some words on that later.\" \"Mother-\" \"Madam-\" Holding up a hand, she stopped their commentaries. \"Nope. What's done is done. Besides, there are more important things to talk about now, like what exactly happened after you were kidnapped Thumbelina.\" \"You weren't hurt, were you?\" Cornelius asked worriedly, grabbing hold of her hand. Moving to get comfortable in the rocking chair, Thumbelina's mother set them down in the crib again. \"No, I wasn't hurt. I had lots of people helping me,\" Thumbelina assured him, smiling. \"Uh-Where should I start?\" she pondered to herself. \"We know a toad took you.\" \"Oh yes, those awful toads. Well, I woke up when I felt my bed close around me. I called for Hero and I heard him barking at someone but I lost consciousness after that. When I woke up, there was this toad woman telling me I could be famous if I joined their toad family. She had me perform with them that day and then she said I had to marry her son!\" \"What?\" Cornelius scowled. \"Oh my.\" Thumbelina's mother gasped. \"Yes, and then they just left me on a lily pad as they left to who knows where. And-and I didn't know how to swim so I started calling for help, when this nice bird heard me and-\" Thumbelina gasped. \"Jacquimo! Oh no, he's still out there looking for you, Cornelius!\" \"Looking for me? Who's Jacquimo?\" \"Jacquimo was helping me look for you. I knew you lived in the Vale of the Fairies but I didn't know where that was so he was asking around to see if anyone knew.\" Thumbelina dropped her head into her hands. \"Oh no, he's stuck out there in the snow. I don't know where he is! What if something happened to him?!\" Cornelius hugged her. \"Don't worry, Thumbelina. I'll send word through the Vale that I've found you. Look, if he hears that, he'll be sure to stop looking and find shelter. Ok?\" Cornelius stroked her hair. \"Don't cry.\" Thumbelina sniffled as Cornelius wiped a tear away. \"I suppose.\" She smiled at him and he smiled back. Thumbelina's mother, forgotten for a moment, smiled at their little moment. Perhaps Thumbelina really had found herself a nice catch. The thought both gladdened her and saddened her, if only that her little girl was growing up and might be leaving soon. Unwilling to dwell on that thought, she gently nudged for the rest of the story. \"I'm sure he will be all right, Thumbelina darling. Now, what did he do when he found you?\" \"Oh yes, well, Jacquimo heard me calling for help and he went under the lily pad and cut it by the stem. But the current was too strong and we couldn't stop the lily pad from going over the waterfall-\" Thumbelina's mother brought a hand up to her chest in slight fright. \"Goodness!\" \"-so we ended up calling for help again and two fishes and the Jitterbugs came over to help. They got me onto the shore and they encouraged me to look for my home or you, Cornelius. I went off with Gnatty, Lil' Bee, and Baby Bug but we got stopped by a beetle before the end of the day. I asked if he could take me up a tree because maybe I could see my house up there, but he would only take me up if I sang with him during his show.\" Wriggling her hands together, she muttered, \"I never got to sing. He made a show about me being ugly.\" Cornelius and Thumbelina's mother frowned, well scowled in the former's case. \"Ugly? Thumbelina, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen! How could anyone ever think you are ugly?\" Thumbelina smiled shyly. \"Thank you. That's what Jacquimo said.\" She spent the next few minutes wrapping up the story of her kidnapping up until where Cornelius found her shivering in the cold. \"Well, that was quite the story there, sweetheart. I'm so glad you're safe and sound now….\" ~0~ It was several days before Thumbelina felt energetic enough to get out of bed and out of her room, and all the while, Cornelius couldn't help but think about how much he wanted to pound the stupid toad and beetle for ever thinking of making a fool of his wonderful Thumbelina. How dare they try to force her to marry them or call her ugly?! Again, Cornelius couldn't help but wish he had come across one of the two so he could teach them a lesson or two on how to treat a lady. At least, Thumbelina had no idea that the toad had been searching for her, if what the Jitterbugs said was true. It was a good thing too, otherwise Thumbelina might not have been as happy and carefree as she currently was now that she was back in her house. Presently, Thumbelina was humming a sweet song she had heard from a passerby several months before they had met, and insisting to twirl around to the beat, had taken Cornelius in hand to dance with to the romantic tune. And not having much else to do in a house that towered over him by a thousand times, Cornelius went along with her little pastime. Wanting to be certain that Thumbelina really was as happy as she seemed, Cornelius smiled down at her sweetly and reminded her, \"You're beautiful, Thumbelina.\" He continued to dance with her even as she slipped a little in surprise and ceased her humming. She burrowed her head into his shoulder and whispered, \"Thank you, Cornelius\" before kissing his cheek. He turned his head and gave her a proper kiss as she pulled away. \"I'm lucky to have found you, Thumbelina.\" He dropped his head on her shoulder and hugged her to him. \"You don't know how scared I got the longer it took me to find you.\" \"Well, you found me. You can relax now, my prince.\" Thumbelina smiled at him and ran her hand through his hair. She began to sway and hummed to a familiar tune. She felt him smile into her shoulder as he hummed a few notes before whispered words joined the song. Let me be your wings Let me be your only love Let me take you far beyond the stars- Cornelius twirled Thumbelina around before going back to swaying next to the fireplace. Let me be your wings Let me lift you high above Everything we're dreaming of Will soon be ours Thumbelina giggled as Cornelius dipped her. Anything that you desire Anything at all… Wrapping her arms around his neck, Thumbelina didn't let him have all the fun as she too began to sing her verse of the song softly to her love. You will be my wings You will be my only love You will take me far beyond the stars… Cornelius grinned down at her and sang the next line. Let me be your wings You will life me high above They harmonized on the next line. Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours… Cornelius twirled Thumbelina around his arm again before bringing her close to him, her face barely a breath from his, as they continued to harmonize. Everything that we desire Anything at all Pressing her hand to his cheek, Thumbelina sang her line- Everyday you'll take me higher… -and Cornelius finished with- … and I'll never let you fall -before giving her a kiss. Thumbelina giggled at this sweet moment. Suddenly, Cornelius lifted her up and Thumbelina quickly threw her arms around his neck as she gazed down at him confusedly. \"Thumbelina, will you marry me?\" Though surprised at the question, Thumbelina grinned in happiness and whispered, \"I will.\" They shared a kiss.[Chapter 2] Winter ~0~ Thumbelina struggled to breath, her head barely managing to remain above the water. Her arms and legs tingled with exhaustion and she could feel panic ripping at her throat. She couldn't feel the floor beneath her feet and once again she wondered why anyone enjoyed taking a dip in the water as a pastime if it just led them to struggles and fatigue. Still, Cornelius was loathed to leave her defenseless again if another situation similar to the toad incident were to arise again. When an arm wrapped around her waist, she let out a sigh of relief and leaned back into the masculine body behind her, letting him take most of her weight. \"Can we stop now, Cornelius? We've been at this for days,\" she whined. \"Oh. Come on, sweetheart. You've almost got it down.\" Thumbelina pouted. \"I'm tired. Please? At least, I know how to float now.\" Cornelius raised a brow at her. \"And how will you get away from enemies by floating?\" Thumbelina turned around in his arms and bit her lip. \"You'll be there to save me.\" Feeling her legs wrap around his waist to stay afloat, Cornelius smirked. \"And not that I plan on not being there, but what if I'm not?\" He beat his legs faster as they sunk slightly and grabbed hold of her thighs. He would be lying if he said he didn't think less than innocent thoughts about their current position. \"I'll have Jacquimo?\" This was meant to be a statement. \"Nope! You need to learn to swim not just float. Come on, you're almost there. We've still got the rest of winter for this.\" He grinned at hearing her little groan of displeasure. Sometime later, after Thumbelina managed to nag Cornelius into giving her the rest of the day off, both lover birds rested on her new makeshift bed. Thumbelina's back was pressed to Cornelius' front and he took pleasure in skimming his hand up and down her arm. It was a comfortable silence and Thumbelina struggled not to give in to sleep, so instead she asked something she's been wondering about for a while. \"So, what exactly do you do as a prince?\" Cornelius paused briefly in his stroking and frowned a little. \"It's not as great as you think it is. Why do you wish to know?\" he said, entwining his fingers with hers. \"I don't know. It's just… I never thought there could be other people my size in the world. I used to wish I was big,\" she admitted, playing with his hand. Turning her head, she rubbed her cheek against his, and said, \"Until you came along.\" She smiled. \"So, I'm curious. What do you do?\" \"Well, I fly around, ride Buzzby, find beautiful maidens, rescue them, fall in love-\" he started mischievously, until Thumbelina gave him a light slap to his hand in protest. \"That's not funny, Cornelius.\" Cornelius snickered. \"Well, it's true.\" He was met with silence as Thumbelina pouted. He sighed. \"It's not all fun and games, you know? It's actually really annoying… having so many responsibilities placed on your shoulders. I can't do anything I want without Mother being there reminding me of them! Why'd you think I left so fast when I heard them calling for me?\" He turned her to face him. \"I was supposed to be helping with the Golding of the Leaves.\" He snorted. \"Well, more like just sit there and\" he imitated his mom for this part \"learn and observe for when you take the crown, son. How else are you meant to learn? How am I supposed to rest in retirement if you don't know how to do anything?\" His voice went back to normal. \"I just want to enjoy my life before I'm saddled with the crown.\" Thumbelina frowned and moved to rub the crinkle out of her love's eyebrows. \"How soon do you have to take the crown?\" \"When I reach twenty-one or my father steps down or if he-\" he bobbed his head, unable to finish the thought. \"You still have time.\" Cornelius scoffed. \"Yeah, not like my Mother cares. I miss one event and she thinks I'll fail the first day I'm King.\" Thumbelina twirled some hair on the back of Cornelius' neck in hopes of calming him down. \"What about your father? Can't you talk to him?\" \"Father doesn't like to get in between us. He'd just act as peacemaker when one of us gets too worked up.\" Thumbelina pulled him closer. \"I'm sure your mother cares, Cornelius. She seems to really worry over your future… and you.\" Cornelius shrugged. \"She doesn't have to be so anxious about it.\" Not liking the change of mood and not wishing to continue talking about his overbearing mother, Cornelius changed the subject. \"Enough about me. I want to know about you.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"Hmm?\" Cornelius hummed with false contemplation. \"How about…\" Thumbelina started shrieking. \"Are you ticklish?\" Cornelius laughed loudly, not waiting for an answer and making a show of wriggling his fingers down Thumbelina's sides. Their combined laughter could be heard by Thumbelina's mother, who stood cooking downstairs in the kitchen. ~0~ A few weeks later, the winter that had so plagued the land of Paris finally seemed to be relenting when rays of sunshine rained down upon the earth. As can be expected, however, the melting snow which littered the ground made it almost impossible to walk outside without accidently stepping into puddles of the stuff. Even so, there remained a chill in the air that sent chills down any unfortunate soul who had to go outside and which depressed anyone who was just killing for some time outside, even in light of recent events. Thumbelina sighed sadly from her place on the windowsill. She hugged her legs and dropped her head onto her knees. She wished spring would come already. She wished she could just get out of her house already without fear of getting lost in the never endless white. She wished the flowers would bloom and the earth would smell like dew and grass again. Most importantly, she wished the sun would shine again. \"It looks like the Annual Bloom is coming soon,\" came a masculine voice from behind her. Thumbelina turned her head to see Cornelius come sit beside her. \"How do you know?\" Cornelius sent her a level look and answered, \"I've seen the signs way too many times. Trust me. By the end of the week, we'll be flying over countless flower beds.\" And bumping his shoulder with hers, continued \"And then you can meet my parents.\" Thumbelina propped her elbows on her knees and cupped her cheeks, not as happy as Cornelius hoped she would be. \"I don't know if they'll like me, Cornelius.\" \"What?\" He threw an arm around her shoulders. \"I know they'll love you. I've told you this. They're very eager to meet you.\" Thumbelina looked at him sharply. \"You've talked to them about me?\" Cornelius cocked his head. \"Some.\" He said, stretching the truth. \"They know of you. I couldn't really say much. You had been kidnapped at the time, so… But I know they want meet you.\" Thumbelina sighed. \"How do I make a good impression?\" Cornelius pretended to think about it. \"Hmm… perhaps, be yourself?\" he said cheekily. \"I mean it, Cornelius.\" \"Look, Thumbelina, think about it. Within one night, you had me completely in love with you. I'm positive that you'll win my parents over just like you won me.\" He dropped his head onto hers and dropped a kiss on her forehead. \"Don't worry about it, ok?\" \"I'll stop worrying about it when I meet them already.\" ~0~ As promised, the end of the week gave way to new blossoms outside and renewed foliage. Rivers went back to streaming water downhill. Bugs went back to feeding on flowers. Animals went back to breeding. And the sun started shining again. All this was taken in by a very happy Thumbelina. Stretching her arms out, Thumbelina turned her face up to the sky and soaked in the heat through her skin. Breathing in the smell of dew in the air, and feeling a slight breeze raise goosebumps along her arms, Thumbelina beamed in pure joy. She giggled and did a little dance around the patio. She didn't notice a certain boy watching her from above until he spoke. \"Something humorous, milady?\" Cornelius teased, flying down to stand behind her. \"Oh Cornelius, isn't it amazing! Winter is over!\" Thumbelina laughed and spun to face him. Cornelius chuckled at her enthusiasm. \"I told you the Annual Bloom was soon,\" he replied, coming up to her. He moved a strand of hair away from her face and behind her ear. \"It's nice to see you happy, but are you ready to meet my parents?\" Thumbelina could feel a bout of nervousness at the question. \"Oh. Do we have to go now?\" she whined. \"The sooner you do it, sweetheart, the sooner you get it over with.\" He admonished her. Thumbelina raised an eyebrow before relenting. \"Ok. Fine.\" \"Great. Let's go.\" Cornelius said cheerfully, pulling on Thumbelina's arm to guide her to Buzzby. A couple of minutes later, Thumbelina and Cornelius could be found flying above a meadow a couple hundred yards away from Thumbelina's house. In fact, if Thumbelina thought about it, her mother could very well reach the spot within five minutes, which meant she could come visit whenever she could. Thumbelina grinned at the thought. Suddenly, Buzzby spiraled downward and alighted on an orange blossom with a petal downturned as a form of entranceway. From further in the flower, a frantic voice came crying once Cornelius announced his presence. \"I'm back!\" Cornelius called out. \"Cornelius, my sunshine!\" came a female voice, as rapid steps could be heard coming toward them. \"Where have you been?! We've been so worried about you! Are you hurt?\" His mother said, dragging her hands along his body to search for any injuries, ignoring Cornelius' protests. Noticing Thumbelina still sitting atop Buzzby, Tabitha raised a brow and stepped back a step. \"Is this the girl you've been searching for?\" she asked, as Colbert came up behind her. Cornelius smiled and turned, grabbing hold of Thumbelina's waist and bringing her down to stand beside him against him. \"Mother, Father, I'd like you to meet Thumbelina.\" He said with pride. \"Hello, my name is Thumbelina. It's so nice to meet you.\" Thumbelina said enthusiastically, masking her nervousness at meeting the King and Queen of the fairies. She curtsied for good measure. \"It's nice to finally meet the girl my son has fallen for.\" Tabitha said somewhat reserved, making Cornelius frown out of Thumbelina's sight and Thumbelina's smile to fall slightly. Hearing this, Colbert spoke up, placing a hand on Tabitha's lower back as a silent reprimand. Shifting her eyes to him, and seeing the frown on her son's face, Tabitha shifted her stance a little and smiled at Thumbelina. \"It's nice to meet you too, Thumbelina. You may call me Colbert, and this is Tabitha.\" Colbert said warmly, making Thumbelina's smile lift up again. \"We've heard so much about you.\" Cornelius relaxed a little at his father's attitude before tensing back up at the next bit. \"Although, he didn't tell us you didn't…?\" He gestured to the wings on his back. \"Oh. Yes.\" Thumbelina mumbled, looking quickly to Cornelius. \"If you don't mind my asking, did something happen…\" Realizing that his father thought Thumbelina lost her wings, Cornelius said, \"Oh no, Father. Thumbelina wasn't born with wings. She's human, actually.\" His parents looked shocked at that. \"Human? Aren't humans supposed to be…taller?\" Thumbelina spoke up before Cornelius could with, \"Well, according to my Mother, I wasn't actually born to her but from a barleycorn flower.\" She twiddled her fingers wondering if her lack of wings would be what stopped the two from accepting her as a daughter-in-law. \"A barleycorn?\" Colbert said slowly, obvious contemplation in his voice. \"Well, anyway, that's not important right now. I have more important news.\" Cornelius butted in, and then with more enthusiasm, added, \"I've asked Thumbelina to marry me and she accepted.\" He grinned, wrapping an arm around Thumbelina's waist again. \"What?\" Tabitha asked, finally stepping back in. \"Hold on a moment. We haven't even heard the story of how you both met, yet.\" She cocked a skeptical eyebrow at the two lovebirds. \"Yeah, that's right.\" Cornelius said slowly, before proceeding to explain how he had skipped out on the Golding of the Leaves – to which his mother scoffed – and found (\"Spied, you mean. We're talking about that later, son.\" Cornelius chuckled nervously) Thumbelina on her windowsill, humming, and proceeded to investigate the situation. Even Tabitha couldn't help from twitching out a smile when Colbert announced that the couple's dancing and singing reminded him of his and Tabitha's courting days, to which Thumbelina cooed and Cornelius ignored lest he gag like teenagers are want to do when reminded their parents were once youthful too. For good measure, the couple also proceeded to explain Thumbelina's kidnapping and subsequent rescue, with Thumbelina or Cornelius filling in on details their partner missed during the storytelling. No longer being as ignorant about the girl promised to her son, Tabitha was visibly less indifferent when she remarked, \"That's quite the story there. I'm glad you're both safe, dears.\" And giving a small smile to Thumbelina, said \"Give your mother a thank you for me. I know this knucklehead could be quite a stubborn handful when he wants to be.\" Cornelius cringed and backed away when Tabitha ruffled his hair in accordance to her words. Feeling a little more relaxed at her tone, Thumbelina giggled and added, \"Oh yes, he certainly made things more lively at home.\" \"Hey!\" Cornelius protested. \"As if you didn't play a hand in it.\" \"You added to it.\" Tension dissipated, the three fairies and one human continued to chat with each other, trying to get to know each other better. As time passed on, Cornelius lived up to his words as Tabitha's reservations about his choice of wife continued to dwindle until she happily invited Thumbelina to stay for lunch with the family. Thumbelina grinned and happily accepted. After a successful supper, Cornelius took Thumbelina to the top of a tree and set her on a branch that overlooked the complete Vale of the Fairies. He poked fun at her for being nervous over meeting his family and giddily remarked how he was right that being herself would win them over. Thumbelina frowned and lightly slapped his arm, pointing out how he was frowning at his mother's initial attitude so he wasn't completely sure how the meeting was going to go either. Grasping her hand, Cornelius pulled her close and kissed her lips before she could continue with that line of thought. Besides, it was all over and his parents were as in love with her as he was. Knowing what he was doing, and before his kisses could render her thoughts into mush, Thumbelina pulled away and leapt further down the branch. Cornelius let out a protest and chased after her, ensuring a game of cat and mouse that ended with Thumbelina taking an unfortunate tumble to the ground below. Cornelius was quick to catch her and, much like what happened after he did pretty much the same thing the first night they met, made a show of dancing with her across the air. Many of his subjects peeked out their makeshift windows when a familiar lullaby floating down to their ears. The future princess was singing to her beau from her place in his arms. Their attentions quickly shifted to the surrounding foliage where a grand number of flowers began to bloom prematurely, only they didn't look premature as they shined and colored the Vale with the beautiful signs of spring. The couple in the air didn't notice this particular happening but two other royals certainly did. \"Colbert, dear, do you remember what the girl said about her birth?\" Tabitha asked, tilting her head to look at Colbert's face. \"You mean how she was born from a barleycorn flower?\" \"Yes.\" Turning back around, and spying a growing lily not far from theirs, continued \"Do you think, perhaps, that she might be…\" \"A spirit of the season?\" Colbert finished for her. \"She might. It would certainly explain how all these flowers are blooming.\" \"There hasn't been one born in decades.\" Tabitha exclaimed in mild surprise. \"Do you think Cornelius suspects…?\" \"No.\" Colbert sighed out. \"No, I don't think he does. Doesn't matter much anyway. This just shows she was meant for our son.\" He wrapped his arm around his wife's waist as they both turned to watch their son and his love dancing in blissful ignorance of their audience. ~0~ At having gone over so well with Cornelius' family, Thumbelina was soon coming back and forth between her home and the Vale. This was good as just a few days after meeting the parents, Cornelius' plan to spread word of the rescue around the Vale proved fruitful as a certain swallow found his way to the meadow the fairies were situated at. He came tumbling in with a merry squawk and a bonjour to the surprised lovebirds having a picnic in an empty patch of land. Thumbelina was quicker to recognize the bird and leapt up to hug him. \"Jacquimo, It's you!\" she cried happily. \"Of course! C'est moi . Oh, Thumbelina. I found you. I have found you.\" He laughed, using a finger to rub Thumbelina's hair. He glanced at the boy, now standing, and quickly exclaimed once he figured out who it was. \"Ah! The fairy prince!\" He took of his hat and bowed. \"I am Jacquimo.\" He announced with flourish. \"Please, call me Cornelius.\" The fairy prince bowed in return. \"I've heard so much about you. Thank you for helping Thumbelina when I couldn't.\" \" Pas de probl è me , Prince Cornelius.\" \"Why did it take you so long to find us, Jacquimo?\" pipped up Thumbelina. \"Ah! I was having a very bad day, Mademoiselle . I got a thorn in my wing.\" He gestured to the wing in question. \"I fell through a trou . I wake up to see a souris watching me and my wing is feeling better. I said merci and voila! I am here.\" He spread his wings with a smile. Smiling at the over simplified recount, Thumbelina decided not to press for details and instead began to bring Jacquimo up to date on what he missed, the engagement and their upcoming wedding – to which Jacquimo was eagerly invited and to which he eagerly accepted – and, as a means of continuing chit chat so that Cornelius and Jacquimo can get to know each other, on the couple's recent visit to the Jitterbugs that ended with Thumbelina and the Jitterbugs playing a prank on Cornelius by having him believe Thumbelina got lost again. Cornelius didn't take too kindly to that game and Thumbelina spent over an hour apologizing. The three would spend over three hours talking. ~0~ As Thumbelina had only been found in mid-winter, and she was a complete mystery to the Royal King and Queen, the wedding between Prince Cornelius and she was scheduled to occur at the end of spring, or Summer Solstice, instead of the traditional Start of the Annual Bloom wedding customary to fairy weddings. Wanting to be married as soon as possible, Cornelius and Thumbelina objected to waiting for the following year so preparation was quickly underway. First, the wedding venue was to be chosen, and wanting her mother to be an avid participant in the wedding party, Thumbelina was quick to suggest the nice and spacious backyard of her mother's house. Not seeing a problem with it, the royals went on to the guest list, the food, decorations, drinks, transportation, and blah blah blah that Cornelius found was best left to his nick-picky mother. After all, as long as Thumbelina became his wife, who cared what the tables looked like or what color the runway was, right? Yeah, it was best to leave the worrying for his detail-oriented mother. His role in the planning of the wedding came in when a very annoyed and very set-on-having-Thumbelina toad came barreling in to the Vale five days before the wedding was set to occur. Tumbling down very unceremoniously from some branch up above, where surely it was spying down on the fairies and where a wingless beetle was currently bemoaning his loss, the toad frightened many of the fairies into their homes and visiting jitterbugs into last minute shelters when he landed next to Thumbelina. With a very angry expression, the toad proclaimed, \"I marry her!\", making Cornelius jumped up quickly to defend his lady love, sword at the ready. Undeniably upset at the audacity of this toad to seek her out after having kidnapped her and almost forcing her to marry him, Thumbelina yelled into his face \"No! I no marry you! Why don't you just go home?!\" Already upset from having found out his 'fiancé' was marrying someone else, Grundel was not going to let her get away from him. He accompanied his \"No!\" with a grab at Thumbelina's arm. \"Let go of me!\" She kicked at his legs in self-defense and ran behind an advancing Cornelius for protection. Incensed by the toad's refusal to leave and his man handling of Thumbelina, Cornelius came to his fiancé's defense. \"We meet at last, Mr. Toad.\" He gritted his teeth. \"Fairy prince? No!\" The toad growled, jumping up and breaking off a dead branch as a makeshift club. \"Thumbelina marry me!\" With a thrust, Cornelius made the first move toward battle. \"I don't think so.\" What ensued was a dance of parries, pivots, and retreats, with the prize being the hand of a woman who so loved the man with wings adjourned upon his back and who loved her back with as much strength as the sun shined upon the two that very morn. With a cry, that very same lady turned and threw toward the toad's direction whatever it is her hands managed to grasp. To her humiliation, it was but a handful of flowers, followed by a goblet, that nevertheless, managed to distract the toad and allowed Cornelius to mock his opponent through a poke on his butt. \"Aah!\" Mockingly, Cornelius said, \"Ha ha. Show me what you got.\" Internally, he was giving a mental thanks to his father for insisting to continue and finish the sword fighting lessons he had so diligently tried to be truant from. Now that he had a partner that gave him motivation to learn how to defend, he took to the lessons like a starving man would to food. It seemed those lessons would be not for naught. Ducking from a swipe to his head from the club, Cornelius made his own jab across the toad's legs, effectively knocking the toad over on his back. Unfortunately, he was distracted from finishing the duel when his soon-to be wife's scream came from behind him, along with a high-pitched nasally voice saying \"Ha ha! Hiya, toots!\" In an uncharacteristic show of strength, Thumbelina answered the beetle's greeting with a punch to the nose, a move taught to her by Cornelius himself. Having paused at such a show from his normally gentle bride, Cornelius failed to see the club coming toward his head so the next thing he knew was how close the ground actually was to his face as he fell over. Recovering quickly, he glanced up and saw the toad taking the chance to stalk toward Thumbelina, mayhap to kidnap her again, and made quickly to hold the toad back by a grab to his leg. Falling over himself, Grundel reached out a hand to land a punch to the fairy prince but at that moment recruitments in the form of fairy guards came in to play. Vastly outnumbered by the royal guards, the beetle and the toad were quickly disarmed and detained, much to the protest of the two. \"She marry me!\" shouted Grundel as he was taken away. The beetle's moustache twitched in agitation. \"You just couldn't've picked another toad, could you?\" Annoyed by the two, as they disrupted the scheduled lunchtime, a guard growled out, \"Quiet!\" Grumbles could be heard fading away as the couple stood together, Cornelius rubbing at Thumbelina's hand as she winced at the pain coming from her fingers. Knowing how to throw a punch was one thing, but actually doing so was another thing altogether as Thumbelina gasped at the instant wave of shock that traveled up her hand when her knuckles connected with the beetle's nose. \"I know you're hurting right now, but that was the best thing I've ever seen.\" Cornelius teased. Despite the pain, Thumbelina smiled with pride. \"It was, wasn't it?\" ~0~ The end of the Annual Bloom rolled around much faster than anyone expected after the recent excitement, and it was with a spring in her step that Thumbelina flounced out of her childhood room for the last time dressed completely in a gorgeous white silk dress made from spider's webs on the big day. After meeting with the beetle and the toad for hopefully the last time, Thumbelina decided to spend the rest of her unmarried days next to her mother who, while extremely happy for her daughter's fortunes, was sad over her little bird flying the nest, both figuratively and literally. Receiving no objection from her beau, who secretly was having a hard time keeping his hands to himself and needed a few days away from her to control himself, she left the very next morning. Now here she was with her mother coming up the rear and her soon-to-be mother-in-law up front walking to the wedding she had dreamed about ever since a certain fairy boy alighted upon her windowsill. \"You look beautiful, my dear.\" Thumbelina's mother said, giggling as she picked up her skirt to walk down the stairs after picking up Thumbelina from the ground. Tabitha flew close and reaffirmed the comment with, \"just splendid, darling.\" Giggling herself, Thumbelina thanked them profusely. Being her wedding day, the day many girls such as herself would remember for the rest of their lives, Thumbelina couldn't stop her grinning even as her cheeks hurt from the action. Her grin, which Cornelius reflected when he saw his beautiful bride coming down the aisle towards him, stayed in place through all the proceedings, through the vows of marriage, through the kiss, and even as Cornelius had to wipe away her happy tears as the crowd shouted in glee and professed loyalty to the newfound princess of the fairies. Coming back down the aisle as the festivities winded down, Thumbelina saw fairly large petals falling down on the runway and looked up to greet her mother. \"Hello, Mother!\" She received a wave which she eagerly returned. Distracted by her mother, she didn't see Cornelius bow to his new mother-in-law nor did she see when he sneakily stretched his arms out towards her until her feet left the ground and she was draped across his arms with a squeal. The crowd cheered. \"Oof! Too many skirts.\" \"Cornelius!\" Thumbelina hissed in surprise. Cornelius only grinned in response as they glided down the aisle toward what was supposed to be their transportation until Cornelius whistled for his trusty steed, Buzzby, to come instead. He smirked thinking about the cringes his parents were sure to be sporting before smiling genuinely when Thumbelina settled in behind him. When she let go, he looked back to see she had tossed her bouquet and it had bounced off her dear friend Jacquimo's head and into his hat. Both couples smiled in amusement at the swallows' exuberant display at having caught it. Snaking an arm around her waist, Cornelius gave her a taste of what was to come with a kiss to her lips. He smiled into the kiss when he felt her eager response. He was ever so thankful that their wedding night would be spent in a special flower chamber set up not far from Thumbelina's mother's house or from the Vale as Cornelius couldn't fathom having to wait any longer than a few minutes to have Thumbelina all to himself. Five minutes on Buzzby later and his wait was over as they landed on a bed of flowers. An open array of tulips were strung together, petals open and stems bent to create a grand bed for the newlyweds, certain petals enclosing the walls of the bridal chamber. To provide shade and privacy for the lovers were lily-of-the-valleys draped elegantly up above, their leaves cocooning the little cove against the heat of the sun. To Thumbelina, this little spot of heaven was beyond even her wildest dreams. To Cornelius, the sight of Thumbelina standing in what was to be the spot of their first coming together was his dreams come true. He gave Thumbelina a few seconds to admire the room before moving in behind her, wrapping his arms around her torso and bringing his lips to the nape of her neck kissing it delicately. Reaching up, he pulled away the hair decoration so that he may thread his hands through her flowing auburn hair. Thumbelina sighed breathlessly at feeling his lips kiss up and down her flesh, his hands moving up and down caressing her belly before one reached up and turned her face towards his to meet his lips. Almost as if that touch ignited a flame of passion between the two, hands began to travel and breaths began to mingle as the lovers moved to complete a dance neither one understood nor knew but were eagerly awaiting with wanton desire. Hair was ruffled and skin was caressed as these two faithful lovers explored the unique contours and dips of their partner's bodies. Goosebumps arose and shivers ran the same course lips had just mapped. Clothes were shed, eyes took in new sights, blushes colored cheeks, and warm bodies pressed together as Cornelius shielded himself inside his wife's body, kissing her tears away when she cried out at the intrusion. He moaned her name when she gave consent to continue and their bodies rocked to a rhythm only they knew until, spent and satisfied, Cornelius drooped over Thumbelina, heaving gasps and shuddering in the aftermath of the experience. Hugging him to her, Thumbelina placed a kiss upon his brow and relaxed her hold on his hips, breathing heavily herself and willing her thoughts to lay only on her husband and not the soreness down below. Once his breath was captured, Cornelius lifted his head and stared down at his love, whose flushed cheeks and dazed eyes warmed his heart. Not wanting to crush her he moved to the side, grabbed hold of Thumbelina's waist, and dragged her onto his chest as he lay on his back. He mischievously ran his eyes from bottom to top, stopping at her face, where he saw a brief flash of a wince before she tried to hide it behind a smile. \"You're hurt…\" \"No…\" \"Don't lie to me Thumbelina.\" \"Well, yes. A little. It's normal, Cornelius.\" \"I know it's normal…\" \"Oh?\" \"Not because of that! You're the only one for me, sweetheart.\" \"And you me.\" \"Good…It was Mother who told me anyway.\" Thumbelina snickered. \"She talked to me about it too.\" \"So that's why you were red that day. You couldn't even look me in the eye.\" Cornelius snickered, thinking back to about a week ago when he could have sworn Thumbelina was avoiding him, ducking behind pillars of stems or behind bushes whenever he spied her red hair and she saw him first. Thumbelina frowned and scooted back to get away from his teasing when she stopped at feeling a certain muscle poking at her, Cornelius giving a groan below her as his hands held her hips still. \"Cornelius!\" Thumbelina gasped. \"I can't help it, Thumbelina, with you sitting on me like that.\" Cornelius smirked. \"You're just too beautiful.\" He pulled her head down to prove it to her. \"I love you, my wife.\" Cornelius said against her lips. He wrapped his arms around her back to draw her against his chest. Thumbelina pulled a hair breath's away, her lips still lightly touching his, to say the words that would seal the deal that night. \"I love you too, my husband.\" Kissing again, neither one noticed the protrusions appearing on Thumbelina's back until Cornelius, feeling the heat of the moment leading towards more intimate things, brushed his hands along Thumbelina's bare back. He pulled away just in time to see the protrusions expand into gorgeous transparent fairy wings, outlined in the glowing dust that sets them apart from other types. His eyes widened slightly before returning to normal, a smile quickly taking over his face. \"What?\" Thumbelina asked lowly. \"Look behind you.\" Confusedly, Thumbelina turned, and stared in disbelief at the foreign pair of wings coming from behind her, unable to believe they were attached to her back until they flapped in response to her growing bewilderment. \"Wings! I have wings!\" She turned her astonished face to Cornelius, whose smile grew into a grin at seeing her excitement. \"My very own wings!\" She laughed happily before kissing him in glee, certain he had something to do it, though that wasn't the case as Cornelius was as puzzled as she over how it happened, not having been informed of his parent's suspicion that she might be a rare spirit of the season, a type of fairy known to be wingless but powerful enough to bring about seasonal changes in individual unique fashions. Nevertheless, not one to ignore the affections of his love, Cornelius quickly moved to bring back the lovey-dovey atmosphere, pouncing on Thumbelina gently, laying her back on the bed as he climbed over her, stroking her chest, and resting his hips between her legs, kissing her lips, breast, tummy, and further. Groans and moans echoed off the walls of their dwelling as once more husband and wife united, sweat mingled, breaths were lost, and they saw the universe and danced on Saturn's rings once more. Catching their breaths again, they lay still, gazing up at the stars that shone through the cracks in the plants above, savoring that moment of piece, before they shuffled to lay side by side again. Throwing an arm around her waist, the new husband pulled his wife to his side, draped a blanket across their bared bodies, and gave in to the pull of sleep. It felt like only minutes had passed when his eyes opened again at the feel of Thumbelina's fingers running through the nape of his hair. Several days had passed since their first night together and each night had been spent in the throes of passion, each getting more and more acquainted with their partner's dips and curves, sweet spots and dud spots. They tired each other out and the few moments they spent awake not loving each other physically was spent regaining some strength back through meals and sunbaking, each providing little insights into what their childhoods looked like when they felt up to it, until desires rose again and they returned to doing what new lovers were want to do. Gazing at her, Cornelius took in the sight of her ruffled hair, sleepy eyes, and bruised lips pulled back into a small smile. He lifted a hand and caressed said lips. \"Good morning, sweetheart.\" Having his deep raspy voice wash over her combined with his peaceful yet sleepy face had heat simmering down her body and Thumbelina bit her lip in response. \"Good morning, husband,\" she whispered. He pulled a lock of hair behind her ear. \"We have to go back today.\" \"I know.\" She responded sadly. \"I don't want to get up yet.\" \"Neither do I.\" A pause. \"I just realized my Mother knows where we are.\" \"So?\" \"So, I prefer not having her barge in here all worried about us not having shown up when we were supposed to.\" Cornelius scowled briefly before relaxing his face, \"Besides you're to be crowned my official princess tonight. I wouldn't want you to miss that.\" He smiled. \"Just a few minutes more?\" \"Hmmm. Fine, after this.\" Thumbelina squealed as she was pushed back down and tickled. \"Stop, Stop!\" Cornelius laughed along with her. \"Who's the greatest husband in the world?\" \"You are! You are, so stop!\" She laughed heartedly until her open mouth was closed by his. She pulled away and they gazed at each other. Pulling her hair away from her face, Thumbelina observed, \"Today is the first day of the rest of our lives together.\" \"No. It's already started.\" ~0~ The End.

Enjoy! 'Once upon a time, there was an lonely widow who longed for a child of her own. One day, she paid a visit to a good witch who gave her a tiny barleycorn. \"Plant it in a flower pot,\" she said, \"and, see what happens.\" The widow planted it and watered it every day…' The widow went over to the flower pot and began to water it, as she did on any normal day. As she put the watering can down, she gasped when she saw a flower start to grow from it. As the flower grew, the top of the stem broke off into two separate red and white buds, side by side. \"Oh, what pretty flowers!\" The widow exclaimed. She gently kissed the red flower bud. The red bud opened up to reveal a tiny girl inside. She had orange hair in a ponytail, a turquoise headband, and flowers around the top of her ponytail. Her dress had a white top with short sleeves, a turquoise corset, and a long, cornflower skirt, along with turquoise shoes. The girl stepped out onto the widow's open hand. \"Hello, Mother.\" She said, smiling. She held onto her mother's thumb and waved at her. \"I will call you Thumbelina.\" The widow smiled. Then, she glanced back at the white flower bud. \"I wonder…\" She gently kissed it. As the white bud opened, Thumbelina and her mother were surprised when they heard a rather loud yawn. Inside of the bud was a girl, similar to Thumbelina. She had bright, fire red hair that was very curly. She had bangs that were swept to the left side of her face. It was also in a ponytail, with a white headband and little white roses around the top of her ponytail. She had on a dress with a light gray top with long sleeves that went down to the base of her thumbs, a white belt, and a long, layered teal skirt. She looked over at her family and smiled. \"Hi, Mother. Hi, sister.\" She leaped into the widow's palm, losing her balance slightly as she landed. The widow never felt happier. She had been blessed with 2 children, instead of just 1! She had the perfect name in mind for her fire-headed youngest daughter. \"I will call you…Seraphina.\" [During 'Thumbelina' ] The widow, Thumbelina, and Seraphina all did their chores around the farm. While Thumbelina helped their mother with her work, Seraphina watched the skies. Just then, Seraphina heard a low croak behind her and turned in alarm. She looked around for the source. \"I wonder what that was. It sounded like a toad…\" Then, she heard it again. She shrieked in fear and ran to find She found them getting ready to go inside. Thumbelina smiled at her sister. \"Hi, Seraphina.\" When she saw her sister's turquoise eyes were darting from side to side, she added, \"What's wrong? You looked like you've seen a ghost.\" \"Well, I… oh, it was nothing.\" Seraphina decided against telling her sister of the ominous croaks she'd heard. Thumbelina raised an eyebrow at her twin. Before she could say anything, their mother called for them to come inside. \"Come on, Sera. You can tell Mother later on.\" Seraphina nodded and followed her sister into their mother's hand. Later that afternoon, the widow was reading to her daughters. Thumbelina was perched atop her mother's nose while Seraphina sat on her shoulder. \"This is the story of the brave dog, who saved the king from an evil wizard.\" The family dog, Hero, barked happily, imagining he was that dog. Before the widow could continue, Thumbelina interjected. \"Oh, Mother. Are there any stories about… about little people?\" \"Well, as a matter of fact, there are, Thumbelina. Look.\" The widow dipped her head a little and caught Thumbelina in her hand, and Seraphina jumped on before it got too low. The girls stepped onto the book page and looked at the picture. Thumbelina gasped. \"Why, they are little! Just like us!\" she smiled at her twin. Seraphina pointed to the wings on the fairy's back. \"But, what are those, Mother?\" \"Those are wings, girls. Those are fairies, and fairies have wings, so they can fly!\" The widow explained. She pointed to the other page. \"And, here, the fairy prince and princess are having a wedding.\" Thumbelina crawled under her mother's glasses to see her better. \"So… I suppose it works best, if two people are about the same size?\" \"Y-yes, of course…\" The widow answered hesitantly. \"Yes…\" Seraphina said softly and sadly. She looked back at the picture of the fairy prince. \"We-well, that's not fair…\" Thumbelina added. \"We must be the only little people in the whole world. I wish we were big.\" \"Me, too.\" Sera agreed. \"No, girls. No. Don't ever wish to be anything but what you are.\" Seeing the sad looks on her daughters' faces, the widow said, \"Bedtime, dears. It's been a long day.\" The girls climbed into her hand and held onto her thumb as she carried them to bed. She set Seraphina on the table near her bed. She liked to sleep by the window. She climbed into her chestnut bed and snuggled in. Then, the widow put Thumbelina into her bed, which sat on top of the crib she'd made for when she had a child. Before she left, Thumbelina called, \"Mother?\" \"Yes, dear?\" \"Could you leave the book open?\" \"Of course.\" The widow picked up the bed and carried it over to the table. She sat it on top of some other books and propped the storybook in front of her daughters. \"Now, we can look at the pictures while we go to sleep.\" Seraphina beamed happily. \"Good night, Mother.\" \"Good night, girls.\" As she departed, she turned to Hero. \"You take good care of them, Hero.\" Hero barked in response. With that, the widow left. Thumbelina gently got out of bed and looked over at the picture. She bowed to it, pretending the prince in the story was actually there. \"Do you think there are real fairies, Sera?\" Seraphina looked out the window and shrugged. \"There could be. Who knows?\" She stood up and walked over to the window sill. Thumbelina \" I know there's someone… Somewhere, someone… Who's sure to find me soon…\" Seraphina danced in front of the stained glass of the window, her reflection a different color in each part. Seraphina \" After the rain goes, there are rainbows I'll find my rainbow, soon…\" While Thumbelina glanced back at the picture of the prince, Seraphina looked out the window. Both \" Soon, it won't be just pretend… Soon, a happy ending! Love, can you hear me? If you're near me, Sing you song… Sure, and strong, and… Soon…\" The girls sighed. Thumbelina crossed her arms and gave a side-glance at the storybook. \"I wonder if there really are such things as fairies…\" My attempt at a Thumbelina with a sister fanfic. Credit goes where credit is due.[Chapter 2] The night air was cool as a large ensemble of fairies flew by the greenery. It was the first day of autumn, and the fairies were giving everything its orangey-red tint. In the middle of the group of fairies sat the King and Queen, waving to any passers-by. Queen Tabitha glanced back, only to falter a bit. Her son was missing. \"Oh, dear…\" she groaned. She looked over at her husband. \"Don't look now, dear husband, but our son is missing again!\" she whispered to him. King Colbert glanced back at his son's empty sit atop a white butterfly. \"So he is… I think he feels a bit silly, riding that white butterfly we gave him.\" He said, trying to give his son some reason for leaving. \"Why should he feel silly?\" Tabitha asked as Colbert reached over to grab her a leaf to fan herself with. She took it gently from his grasp. \"It doesn't quite make the right impression on the ladies.\" \"What about the impression on the Court?!\" She countered. She kept a smile plastered on her face, trying to keep the other fairies from alarm. \"Colbert, my love. It is the autumn today, and we've begun the Golding of the Leafs. He should be here! \" she added sharply at the end of her sentence. \"Tabitha-\" \"He'll hurt himself. I just hope he's not buzzing the Vale on that wretched bee! He is the crown prince, for heaven's sake!\" Colbert chuckled. \"Tabitha, dear. Have you forgotten what it's like to be 16? Besides, he has Darren there with him.\" He told his wife, referring to Cornelius' personal guard. Tabitha huffed slightly. \"And, he's just as bad as Cornelius.\" Meanwhile, a bumblebee flew by some dandelions. His rider, Prince Cornelius, glanced around nervously. His guard was really cranking down on leaving him behind, mostly because of his mother's strict rules. Just then, he heard faint singing and brought his bumble back to a slightly opened window. \"Whoa, whoa.\" They landed, and Cornelius watched as Thumbelina danced. \"What a beautiful voice…\" \"Cornelius!\" A deep voice sounded from behind the prince, startling him. Darren laughed, throwing his head back. He ran a hand over his dark brown hair, trying to calm down. \"Well, next time, you should wait for me. What are you doing he—\" Darren stopped mid-sentence as his eyes landed on Seraphina, who was too busy dancing and humming with her sister to notice the fairies outside their window. Darren felt his breath catch in his throat and nearly fell over. \"Who is that?\" \"I don't know. Let's go find out.\" Cornelius flew quickly behind the book page Thumbelina was in front of, while Darren stayed on the window sill. Not wanting to scare the rare beauty in front of him, he ended up shadow-dancing behind her, staying out of her line of vision. Cornelius cut an opening in the picture where the window was and stuck his head through. \"Hahaha, may I cut in?\" Thumbelina gasped in fear and ran over to hide in the teacup. While Cornelius ran over to her, Seraphina faltered in her dancing, causing Darren to bump into her. She backed away from him in fear, nearly falling off the window sill. Luckily, Darren caught her before she plummeted downward. \"A-are you alright?\" he asked as he set her upright. Cornelius looked down into the teacup and waited patiently for Thumbelina to come out. He flew over and landed on the spout once Thumbelina was out. Seeing her glance at him strangely, he became self-conscious. \"W-what are you staring at?\" When Thumbelina turned away from him, he added, \"Well, say something, will you?\" Seraphina ran over to her sister and pointed to the storybook picture. \"Look! They're like them!\" \"U-uh, beg pardon?\" Cornelius said, not understanding. \"Like who?\" Darren asked. Thumbelina smiled and giggled a little. \"We thought we were the only ones our size in the whole world!\" At that moment, Hero woke up. He saw the 2 intruders and growled at them. Both men instinctively pulled out their swords to protect the girls. Thumbelina and Seraphina stepped in front of them. \"No, no, Hero! They're friends, look!\" Seraphina bowed to Darren. \"Uh, how do you do, sir? My name is Seraphina.\" \"And, I'm Thumbelina. Thank you for coming to visit.\" Thumbelina motioned with her hand for them to play along. Luckily, the boys caught on. \"Oh, no-no trouble at all.\" \"The pleasure is ours.\" Darren said as he bowed and re-sheathed his sword. Hero settled down and went back to sleep. \"Sorry about that.\" Thumbelina said. \"Thumbelina… Oh, it's a lovely name!\" Cornelius sighed, spinning in place. Thumbelina thanked him. \"I-Im Cornelius.\" \"Cornelius.\" Thumbelina tested the name. She giggled, and spun around. \"Well, that's a funny name.\" Realizing her blunder, she gushed, \"Oh! I-I mean, it's perfect!\" Darren smiled at Seraphina. \"Seraphina… That's a beautiful name.\" Seraphina ducked her head and blushed. \"T-thank you. What's your name?\" \"Darren.\" Sera smiled. \"Your name is beautiful, too.\" She made a face. \"Wait, I meant, handsome. No, I mean… I don't know what I meant.\" She sighed in defeat. Darren laughed. \"It's alright. I know what you were trying to say.\" Then, Darren looked around to see Thumbelina pulling Cornelius outside. He and Seraphina followed them. \"Oh, why, he… He's amazing!\" Thumbelina said. \"Hey, would you like to... go for a spin?\" Cornelius offered. As Thumbelina hopped on, he added. \"Come on, it'll be fun!\" Darren stepped in front of Buzzby, Cornelius' bumble. \"Cornelius, don't get carried away.\" Cornelius smirked at him. \"Same to you.\" With that, they flew off. While they were taking off, Thumbelina said, \"Oh, I wish I had wings.\" \"Maybe, someday you will.\" Cornelius said. \"Hold on tight! Whoa!\" Buzzby flew faster, sending Cornelius back a bit. He and Thumbelina laughed as they flew over to the bridge. Cornelius \" Let me be your wings Let me be your only love Let me take you far beyond the stars…\" A group of small bugs carried a flower necklace over to Thumbelina and put in around her neck. She gently touched the tip of her finger against the water underneath them, sending ripples through the river that seemed to shine. Cornelius and Thumbelina started dancing over the water. Cornelius \" Let me be your wings Let me lift you high above Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours…\" \" Anything that you desire, anything at all… Everyday, I'll take you higher and, I'll never let you fall…\" \" Let me be your wings Leave behind the world you know For another world of wondrous things… We'll see the universe, and dance on Saturn's rings… Fly with me, and I will be your wings!\" As they flew by, one of the little bugs from earlier pointed after them. \"She's gonna marry the fairy prince, huh, Mama?\" \"Well, perhaps.\" Her mother said. Cornelius \" Anything that you desire, Anything at all… Thumbelina \" Anything at all…\" Cornelius \" Everyday, I'll take you higher, and I'll never let you fall!\" Just as he sang this, Cornelius released his hold on Thumbelina, causing her to fall downward. Thumbelina, none the wiser, continued to sing. Luckily, Cornelius caught her. Thumbelina [Cornelius] \" You will be my wings [Let me be your wings] You will be my only love [Get ready for another world of wondrous things…] Wondrous things are sure to happen! Both \" We'll see the universe, and dance on Saturn's rings!\" Cornelius/Thumbelina \" Heaven isn't too far/ Heaven is where you are Both \" Stay with me, and let [you/me] be [my/your] wings!\" They flew off into the sky. Meanwhile, a toad, who was watching them, sighed dreamily as his mother came out. She exclaimed something in Spanish, and added, \"This voice is fantastica! \" Her son, Grundel, said, \"Mama… I love her.\" Mrs. Toad smiled toward the sky, thinking up a plan. [During Let Me Be Your Wings ] Seraphina and Darren watched as Thumbelina and Cornelius flew off. Sera turned to Darren. \"Do you have a bumblebee?\" Darren shook his head. \"No. I prefer to fly with my own wings. That way, they'll get stronger. Why do you ask?\" Seraphina looked down. \"O-oh, well… I was wondering if you would be able to take me on a flight, too. But, I wouldn't want you to have to carry me. That would be too much work for you, flying and carrying someone.\" Darren scooped her up into his arms and smiled. \"It's not trouble at all. Hold on.\" He lifted them easily from the window sill and through the sky. While they were flying, they passed by a group of bugs start were dancing and singing. Seraphina pointed to them and asked, \"Oh, Darren, can we go dancing with them? It looks like fun!\" \"Of course.\" Darren said, smiling at her. They landed and smiled at all the happy couples dancing with each other. Seraphina smiled as she took hold of Darren's hands and started waltzing with him. He glanced around as a new song started playing just in time for them to join along. Darren \" I bring you a song And, I sing as I go For, I want you to know That I'm looking for romance…\" Seraphina blushed as Darren sang to her. Seraphina \" I bring you a song In the hope that you'll see When you're looking at me, That I'm looking for love…\" All the other couples made room as Darren and Seraphina twirled and danced into the middle, where everyone could see. Others \" I'm seeking that glow Only found when you're young and it's May Only found on that wonderful day When all longing is through…\" \" I'm seeking that glow Only found when a thrill is complete Only found when two hearts gently beat To the strains of a waltz that's both tender and new…\" Darren started flying with Seraphina above the others, still dancing. Darren \" I bring you a song, For I'm seeking romance…\" Others \" You're by my side There's a moon up above It shines with a light, that's both mellow and bright It's easy to see That tonight, we shall fall in love…\" All \" I bring you a song… For, I'm seeking romance…\" As they flew back to Seraphina's house, they saw Thumbelina and Cornelius on the window sill. Suddenly, they rushed inside. Cornelius motioned for them to hurry inside. They all crouched down, hiding. \"Cornelius, who are those people?\" Thumbelina asked, referring to the voice he heard. \"That's the Queen of the Fairies. My mother.\" \"Your mother?\" Seraphina questioned. Cornelius nodded. \"Look, we have to go, but... can we come back tomorrow?\" Darren asked. \"Yo-your mother? But-but, you ar-are the... Tomorrow?\" Thumbelina was so flustered, she apparently forgot how to speak. Cornelius grasped her hands. \"Yes, tomorrow. Yes, I'm the Prince. Look... will you meet my parents?\" \"I... I will.\" Thumbelina giggled. \"I will, Prince Cornelius, yes!\" Seraphina glanced at Darren curiously. \"Are you a prince, too?\" Darren looked down for a moment. \"No... I'm Cornelius's personal guard...\" He trailed off sadly. He would understand if she wanted to be with a prince. She deserved it. Sera hugged Darren, seeing the sad look on his face. \"You can come back tomorrow. We'll be waiting on you!\" At that point, the Queen and King were both calling out for Cornelius and Darren. They rushed outside to Buzzby. Thumbelina and Seraphina followed them. \"You won't forget to come back... will you?\" Thumbelina asked the prince. \"I promise.\" He answered. Then, he leaned forward to kiss her, as he'd tried to do many times before. But, Buzzby took off before their lips could touch. Cornelius and Darren waved good-bye to the girls as they flew off. Thumbelina sighed. \"Oh, Cornelius...\" She smiled, thinking of her loved one. As the 2 girls went back inside, Seraphina climbed into Thumbelina's bed, which was closer. \"What are you doing?\" Sera murmured something about being too sleepy to go over to her own bed. Lina chuckled softly at her sister. She decided to just climb into the bed and go to sleep.[Chapter 3] From this point on, the story changes a bit from the movie, just to avoid copyright and all that. Plus, it's kinda boring to have OCs in it and just follow the same stuff from the movie. Seraphina flipped over in her sleep, only to fall out of the shell and onto the hard wooden stage the bed was rested on. She stood up in alarm and looked around. Just then, a female toad with bright pink hair pulled a curtain back and smiled at her. Then, the toad's smile turned into a deep frown. \"Oh. You. Is your sister awake?\" The redhead, never taking her eyes off of the toad, stepped backward toward the bed and gently shook her sister. \"Thumbelina! Wake up, please, we have to go!\" she whisper-yelled. Thumbelina stirred a bit before waking up fully. She looked up and saw the toad. \"Oh! W-who are you?\" \"We are the Singers de Espaina.\" She answered. Seraphina nodded quickly. \"That's nice. What are we doing here?\" Mama Toad walked past Seraphina and put her hands on Thumbelina's shoulders. \" She is going to be a star. I wasn't expecting you to be inside.\" She put her finger up to her chin, faking considering what was to become of the stowaway. \"I suppose you could be a backup singer.\" Sera crossed her arms and glared at the toad, thoroughly insulted. Then, she stomped over to her sister and pulled her up and away from Mama Toad. \" We aren't singing for you. We need to go home, so just show us the way and -\" As she had spoken, Seraphina had turned around, only to be met face-to-face with 3 more toads. She shrieked in fear and clung to Thumbelina, who simply stared at the toads with a fearful expression on her face. Mama Toad walked over to the other toads and smiled. \"These are my sons. Mozo, Gringo, and Grundel.\" Mozo, wearing a jester's costume, and Gringo, wearing an old admiral's costume, both bowed directed at Seraphina. Grundel, wearing a clown costume, bowed slightly to Thumbelina. Gringo and Mozo hopped between the two sisters and smirked down at Seraphina, frightening her to no end. \"Who is she, Mama?\" Mozo asked. \"Just a back-up singer.\" Sera glared at her, forgetting the terrifyingly large toads beside her at the moment. She walked over to Mama Toad, taking a moment to push Grundel away from her sister as he was about to make a move to hold Thumbelina's arm. \"Now, you listen here, you -\" \"Seraphina, calm down, please?\" Thumbelina quickly ran over to stand between Mama Toad and her twin, holding onto Seraphina's shoulders. \"We'll need her help to get back home to Mother.\" \"What makes you think she'll help us get back home?\" Sera crossed her arms and looked at Mama Toad, but was still talking to Thumbelina. \"You heard her. She wants to make you a star. \" She mimicked the toad's Spanish accent, to the best of her ability. Mama Toad put her hands on her hips, glaring at Seraphina. She was getting tired of her attitude and her constant talk of getting home. The pink-haired female pulled Thumbelina toward her. \"Listen to me. Don't you want to be famous?\" \"Famous?\" Thumbelina asked, slightly interested. \" Si, Thumbelina. Famous. Important.\" Mama Toad inwardly smirked when she saw the pleased look on the orange-haired girl's face. \"Loved by everyone!\" Then, Thumbelina smiled brightly. \"Oh, but Cornelius loves me already. That's enough for me.\" She giggled and went over to her sister. \"I think I'm gonna marry him.\" \"Really?\" Seraphina asked, happily surprised. Seeing her sister nod, she hugged her tightly. \"Oh, that's wonderful!\" \"Marry him?\" The twins looked over at Mama Toad as she scoffed. \"That... would be a very big mistake.\" She warned, shaking her head at them. \"Why?\" Seraphina asked, watching her closely. \"It'll get in the way of your career in show business, doing all those things domesticos. \" She explained. The girls exchanged a look before Thumbelina stepped toward her and asked, \"What things?\" Then, Mama Toad explained all of the problems of marriage and rasing children: dirty dishes, snotty noses, cooking meal after meal, broken household appliances and dirty diapers. It was enough to make a person wince. However, Seraphina saw thought Mama Toad's trick. From what she had observed and talked about with her mother, she knew that there were many goods to having kids and being married. But, her words had gotten to Thumbelina, who was almost considering joining the toads in their traveling singing group. \"Well, when you put it like that...\" Thumbelina frowned. Seraphina stepped in. \"It's very biased.\" She turned to her sister. \"Come on, Lina. We'll find our own way home.\" Grundel frowned and pulled his mother to the side. \"Mama, she is in the way!\" He whispered, pointing at Seraphina. \" I marry Thumbelina. The other one leaves!\" Mama Toad nodded at her son. \"I couldn't agree more. Leave everything to me.\" She made her way over to the 2 sisters with a small, yet evil, smirk plastered on her face. Mozo and Gringo busied themselves with gathering a large crowd to watch them perform. \"Thumbelina, won't you sing for us? Just once?\" Thumbelina rubbed her arm nervously before she gave a small smile. \"Well, what should I sing?\" \"Hmm...\" Mama Toad looked sideways at Grundel, still smirking. \"How about a love song?\" Seraphina looked between Mama Taod and Grundel, beginning to become suspicious of the two of them. Thumbelina, being none the wiser, smiled a bit more and stepped forward to sing. Thumbelina \"I close my eyes, and see his eyes So soft and warm and clear... I dream awake of holding him, I dream that he's right here... I sense in all his silences, More than his words could say... 'Don't fight your feelings,' Says my heart A heart I will obey.\" As Thumbelina sang, she twirled around, invisioning dancing with her prince. Seraphina smiled at her and began to sing with her, much to Mama Toad's annoyance. Seraphina \"Am I feeling love? Am I feeling love..? Can it really be?\" Both \"Happening to me, Am I feeling love?\" Thumbelina giggled and began dancing again. Seraphina took up the next verse. Seraphina \"For sure, a most unlikely match. Implosable and strange. But, when it seems my heart cannot, Refuse... to rearrange! Am I feeling love? Am I feeling love..?\" Both \"Can it really be Happening to me? Am I feeling... Love...\" As the girls sang the last note together, the crowd of pond residents clapped and cheered for them, throwing coins onto the stage. A few even wiped tears from their eyes, moved by their singing. Thumbelina smiled and waved at them, blowing a few kisses and bowing. Seraphina gave a small wave of gratitude, blushing a bit. Mama Toad walked over to them. \"See? Being a star is wonderful, Thumbelina.\" \"Oh, thank you for this, Ms. Toad, thank you.\" Thumbelina beamed. Then, she gave Mama Toad a serious look. \"But, we really must get home. Cornelius and Darren will be waiting for us.\" \"Forget about them.\" Mama Toad waved off Thumbelina's concern. \" You are going to marry my son, Grundel.\" Thumbelina's face went pale. \"I what?!\" \"I love Thumbelina.\" Grundel said happily. Mama Toad hopped over to a lily pad with Thumbelina and set her down on it. \"You wait here, Thumbelina. We'll be right back with the padre! \" \"Oh, no, no. I love Cornelius. I'm not going to marry anyone but him.\" Thumbelina tried to explain. Seraphina looked over at them, but Mozo and Gringo hopped in front of her, blocking her view. \"Today, you marry my son!\" Mama Toad exclaimed. Seraphina shoved past the 2 toads in front of her, making her way over to the lily pad. She wasn't about to let some bossy toad tell her sister who she could and couldn't marry. The fiery redhead hopped onto the lily pad just as the stage began to move away. Sera grabbed onto her sister's arms for balance. \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" Thumbelina answered. She looked after the stage/boat to see that it was too far away for any of the toads to hear her. \"Oh, no. They're gone. How are we going to get home now?\" Seraphina looked up at the sky just as a bird flew into view. \"I think I have an idea.\" She pointed to the bird so that her twin could see. \"Oh! Mr. Bird! Over here, please!\" The girls began to wave their arms in the air, hoping to get the bird's attention. At the widow's home, Cornelius and Darren had flown onto the window sill. When they landed, the multitude of gifts that Cornelius had brought for Thumbelina had fallen out of his hands. \"Is all of that really necessary, Your Highness?\" Darren asked, crossing his arms. Cornelius stopped in his attempt to gather the gifts and playfully glared at his guard. \"At least I brought something. Besides, I didn't know what she would want, so I brought a little of everything.\" He chuckled a little. Darren rolled his eyes before they landed on the room. He stood still as he observed the once clean room that was now in shambles. \"Cornelius, look.\" He said, pointing inside. \"Wha... What happened?\" The fairy prince looked around in alarm. \"Where are Thumbelina and her sister?\" The two fairies flew quickly around inside, giving everything a good glance, hoping to find the girls unharmed. Hero trudged sorrowfully into the room and barked when he saw the prince and his personal guard. Cornelius flew over to the dog while Darren continued to search the room. \"Where are they?\" Cornelius asked, leaning onto Hero's nose. Hero barked a few times, pointing his snout at the window. \"They left? Out the window?\" Darren turned his head toward them. \"No, they wouldn't just leave.\" He paused a moment. \"Maybe they were taken against their will.\" \"Stolen away?\" Cornelius questioned. Hero nodded, panting happily. The prince turned to him and asked, \"Who did it? Who took them?\" Hero blew out his cheeks, mimicking a toad or frog. Cornelius looked at the old dog in alarm. \"A toad?!\" When Hero nodded sadly, the prince put his head in his hands, beginning to worry about his love. Darren looked over at them quickly before turning and flying out of the window. Cornelius looked after him as he left. \"Darren! Ugh... Hero, you take care of Thumbelina and Seraphina's mother. Darren and I will go and find them.\" He quickly mounted his bumble and put his helmet on. \"Everything will be all right, Hero. Don't you worry.\" With that, he flew off to catch up with his guard and search for his missing princess-to-be. I skipped the scene with the girls being kidnapped because I wasn't entirely sure how I'd go about writing it. I also left out the toad's song because it didn't really fit in since I had Mama Toad and Seraphina fighting. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I own nothing but the OCs. Enjoy!

It's their second year of Pee-Wee Football and reports say that their Double-Coach O'shea team is the now the best in the entire Midwest. But that's beside the point. \"Dude. I know you hate her, Spike, but Icebox is really—\" Spike glares ahead, not even willing to care who's speaking to him right now. \"Shut up.\" The Icebox. She's taken over his team. She's taken over his field. And what's worse, she's taken over his brain. She literally confuses him. Really, how can someone of the female population be that talented at a typical-all-guy sport and still be confident enough to be the only one in their ranks to show up for all their games wearing that stupid little skirt? As far as he's concerned, it's not even that witty on her part, or that charming, but somehow the idea just caught on overtime and now that's her signature uniform. She stands out because of it. Everyone knows it's her and they get a real kick out of it. And that's why Spike just doesn't get it. She always tries to be one of them during practice drills other days, and wants so badly to be treated like a boy...and yet, she expects that to happen when she makes an ironic fashion choice like that one? If anything, she's sending the inhabitants of Urbania more mixed signals than she originally had before. Last year, Danny O'shea had arranged a town-wide carwash to raise funds for his new team, to make their faces known, to gain more support from their community. This year, that tactic continues to be successful in Urbania. The sun's out and the weather is humid right now and it's the perfect week for the team to be outside, being active, even though it's not on the field practicing. But, the one problem this season they have is pooling Kevin's Cowboys and Danny's Little Giants together to form one larger single team instead. The brothers have come to accept it of course since they are now co-coaches—though it's actually some of the kids who have yet to let go of the past and forget that they were once rivals—and when the adults aren't close by, hovering over them to supervise, sometimes things get out of hand. Tad cries out when a bucket of suds comes rolling up towards him and knocks hard against his ankles, soaking his shoes all the way through his socks in the aftermath. He looks up in disdain, and there's Spike and Icebox, completely oblivious of what happened because they're too busy wrestling with a hose, and kicking out their feet, and wasting more water on themselves rather than on the parked car right in front of them. \"Hey!\" he shouts at them, but it's futile. \"Quit it!\" Icebox shrieks, totally blinded by her fury, digging into Spike's ribs with her elbow. \"Stay on YOUR side!\" \"I WAS on my side!\" Spike pushes back, barking out, \"You stay on your side!\" \"I was here first!\" \"You were not!\" \"Just let go!\" \"You let go!\" Icebox seems to just snap, and she drops her section the hose on the spot, taking a sharp step backwards with her hands up. Yup, she is so done with him. Spike's balance is thrown off somewhat by the sudden release, and the hose ricochets in his hands. Icebox doesn't completely walk away though, not yet, and definitely not that easily. She has to pick up the two wet, foaming sponges left sitting on the hood of the car first, throwing both of them at Spike's head as hard as she can, and then, she stalks off, heading inside the gas station for some space. Tad sighs in defeat and knows it's just safer to ignore it. He refocuses on wiping the layer of dry dirt off the car door before him. It's not like they haven't gotten into water-fights before...because, hey, that is the fun part about doing these carwashes on these hot days, but still...the ones before were harmless and playful...they've never turned so... hostile like that. With a blink of an eye, they're two years older already, and they're back in school, and she's standing in the middle of the Hammersmith living room, dropping off a textbook for Spike that's holding differently-colored sheets of paper inside it. (Spike has missed two days' worth of Environmental Lab assignments due to a serious sore throat and headache. She knows this because they do have that one class together.) He's sprawled over the 70s-patterned couch, watching live wrestling. \"Here.\" She doesn't sound very sympathetic as she slaps his homework down upon the coffee table near where his feet are resting, but she does acknowledge that he is looking pretty miserable and he's trying to hide it from her. \"You've got extensions on the first two until next week. But the blue assignment is still due Friday morning along with everyone else's.\" \"Thanks,\" he says, albeit pessimistically and she wonders if he is truly grateful deep down or not. But, she won't back down and recoil from him like a coward. So, she nods back at him briskly, commenting, \"Anytime,\" and without realizing at first, she lingers there for a long moment afterwards, eyes causally skimming the room. She's been at his house before, sure, but she hasn't been fully inside it, seeing Spike in his natural habitat. And, truthfully, it feels...quite homey and normal despite the fact that Spike is not that evolved by Darwin's standards and his father before him was obviously raised by all buff, rough and tough military figures too. Although, she notices a certain something is still missing from the atmosphere; a splash of a woman's presence here and there...and she notices this only because she doesn't have that sort of something or that feeling in her dad's house either. It's something she can probably relate to, actually. Spike catches her snooping or whatever, and snarls out a testy \" What? \" She blinks, shaking her head rapidly. \"Nothing,\" she gives in, \"I'll just go.\" A month later, she ends up on the top of Cheery Hill with Spike off all people, with their bikes, since Junior is out of state visiting his father up north, and her dad's taking that chance to take Patty out on another private date that night. They merely sit there for a while, quietly overlooking the sunset. She's not angry at him for once and he's not seething. They're just...content, idle. \"Do you know where your mom is now?\" she eventually asks him, still gazing straight at the dying sun. Spike answers without delay, \"No. Do you?\" \"Mine's probably on stage somewhere,\" she supposes, only half-humorously, \"sitting under spotlights and talking to movie-stars over coffee.\" \"...Do you forgive her for leaving?\" That's when she finally turns her head and sees the lines in his profile hardening. And she can sense it's from a silent stab of pain that's suddenly surfacing. (Well, damn. He might have more depth to him than she gives him credit for, after all. Spike Hammersmith has layers beneath that rugged, brash exterior. Who knew, right?) \"Sometimes,\" is what she shares with him sheer honesty. \"You?\" \"Yeah. Sometimes.\" It's another free and boring Saturday afternoon, so they're at the park. Her shove this time around hardly makes him wince. \"C'mon, Ice Bottle,\" he teases her with a throaty laugh, \"is that really all you've got today?\" \"Just throw me the ball again, you jerk,\" she demands coolly. He grins and obeys her order. He chucks the ball to her, fast and hard, and she catches it, holding it tightly to her middle and power-sprints around him, not holding back. And as soon as his arms are reaching towards her, she spins on her heels expectedly, and the lack of physical contact makes him stumble. She giggles in victory when she reaches the imaginary end zone and finally scores herself another fake-point. He responds by charging at her anyways and she dashes off again, still cutting round him just in time, and they keep on blocking and dodging, running from one end of the park to the other. Eventually he is able to steal the ball away and the chase flips to the other side. In the end of the contest, Icebox propels forward and tackles him. By then they're both beat, just having the energy left over to untangle themselves and roll back over the grass, gasping for air. \"Truce?\" she proposes, swallowing hard. \"Okay,\" he yields. Just for today. \"Truce.\" Three more years go by, and life in Urbania pretty much remains the same as it always does. However, kissing Spike on top of Cheery Hill is something new to her, and frankly, it wasn't pre-calculated or anticipated. It just happened. And, it wasn't a bad moment per se, or even that embarrassing. It still took her by surprise though, as she woke up in the morning after it took place. Because the one leading fact was, that she's had this image swimming in the back of her head for some time now—and it's only naturally for girls, even sporty-girls like her, to fantasize about what their first kiss is going to be like, isn't it? Well, hers—was, more or less—different than she thought it would've been, since, originally, the lips she dreamed up in her head had always belonged to Junior up until now. And for a little while, that's what she was mentally preparing herself for; that's what her whole judgment on kissing a boy would've been based on. But, along the way, her deep-seeded desire of kissing Junior washed away little by little, like the ocean's tide rippling upon sand. Spike has set new standards and has inserted a few additional new requests and wants in her mind. Generally speaking, she doesn't hate the feeling either. In all actuality, it has clicked perfectly in place like it does in the movies and even though Spike was far from winning her affections in the very beginning, now it just sorta made sense to her, like it was going to be inevitable no matter what. He's a hothead and rash, when she's cool-blooded and sturdy. He's forceful in nature and she's resolute. He's a boy, she's a girl. Clearly. They are the sun and moon in endless chase. Sheer opposites that clash with each other as much as they do attract.

Then I got on here and saw that most of the fanfics were Becky/Spike. Ick. I just can't see it. Anyway, here is my attempt at a Becky/Junior fic. Just a short oneshot. Please review! Disclaimer: I don't own The Little Giants. \"Mommy, I'm scared.\" \"Dannie, it's 11:00 at night. What's the matter?\" \"There's thunder and it's scary and I had a nightmare.\" \"Alright, shhh. Let's not wake up Daddy and Joey.\" \"Beck, what's the matter?\" said Junior, waking up. \"Dannie had a nightmare and the thunder is scaring her. It's okay, go back to bed, I got it.\" \"Okay,\" Junior rolled back over in the bed that he and Becky shared. \"Here, Dan, let's go into your bed and Mommy will tell you a story. Come on.\" Dannie's bedroom was super frilly and pink—exactly the way she asked for it. The complete opposite of her mom when she was Dannie's age. Becky tucked her six year-old daughter back into the small child's bed, climbed in herself, and pulled the covers up. \"Baby, what story do you want?\" \"I want a love story Mommy. But it has to be funny.\" \"Well, that's pretty exact, isn't it?\" \"Mo-o-ommy. Come on!\" \"Alright, alright. Ummm, let me think.\" After about a minute passed and Becky still hadn't come up with a story to tell Dannie, the little girl started to get restless. \"Oh I've got one!\" \"Okay, tell it!\" \"Okay, so there once was a little ten-year old girl. She loved to play football, and that was what her uncle was kind of famous for. When she showed up for tryouts that year, her uncle was coaching. She was a good player but it was kind of odd for a girl to play football, so her uncle didn't pick her for the team. She was very upset and got her dad to coach their own team. However, she was probably the best player on that team and they were worried to face her uncle's team, the Cowboys.\" \"Mommy?\" Dannie interrupted her mother. \"I don't see how this is a love story.\" \"It will be. You have to get the full story. Be patient.\" \"Fiiine.\" \"So, while the girl was at the grocery store with her dad, she was walking along an aisle and looked up. She heard a noise and saw a roll of toilet paper and a crash. She jumped up to look between the shelves to see into the next aisle. It was a blond boy who was throwing toilet paper rolls into his mom's cart.\" \"He sounds cool.\" \"He is, sweetie. Now, as the girl was staring at him, three of her friends on her team came 9ij.8'up to the boy. They wanted to know if he would join their team. The girl was ecstatic. Now their team would be better, she didn't have to play quarterback anymore, and most importantly, she would see him again!\" \"Awwwwwww.\" \"But here's the embarrassing part. The boy heard a noise that she made and looked over there. The girl immediately ducked her head down. When she looked out again, the boy wasn't there! So she started poking her head around, trying to figure out where he went. Then, all of a sudden, he jumped in front of her and said 'hey you!' It scared the girl and she fell backward, bringing the shelf with all of the food on it with her. In the middle of all the boxes, she looked up and saw the boy and her three friends.\" \"Oh, I feel bad for the girl!\" Becky heard a noise and looked up. There was Junior, standing in the doorway, holding their two year-old son Joey with a grin on his face, laughing at her. \"Yeah, me too,\" Becky smiled and continued. \"So she got her dad to ask his mom to see if he could play and he could. So they messed around the whole season, and the entire team became closer and got better as the big game approached. There was one problem. At their team's big car wash to raise money to buy their uniforms, her cheerleader cousin showed up. And the boy was flirting with her.\" \"No! The cousin can't get him! The girl has to!\" \"I'm glad you feel that way Dannie. But hold on, the story isn't over yet.\" \"Okay, keep going!\" \"The girl knew it was because her cousin was a cheerleader and she was just a teammate. She was a tomboy. And then, another teammate said that she should be a cheerleader. He was joking but it made the girl think. Should she become a cheerleader? It might make the boy like her more if she acted like a girl, not his teammate. So she went to her aunt, who was the cheerleading coach, and asked for a uniform and pom-poms.\" \"NO! She can't be a cheerleader! How is the team going to win without her? Now they only have the boy!\" \"Dans, calm down.\" \"But…but now they can't win!\" \"Just keep listening. It's not over yet.\" \"Fine. Keep going Mommy!\" \"Okay. So, it was the day of the big game. All of the girl's team was in the locker room getting ready except her. She stood outside of the door in her new cheerleading uniform getting up the courage to go in. She heard all of her friends in there yelling through the air vents to the other team, trying to get them nervous. All of a sudden she heard her name yelled. 'Yeah the Icebox is gonna defrost you!' the boy yelled.\" \"Hey Mommy, isn't that what Daddy calls you sometimes?\" Dannie asked. \"Yep, I do Dans,\" Junior said from the doorway. \"Daddy! Come get in!\" Junior walked in with Joey and sat down in the chair next to Dannie's bed. \"Here, I'll sit right here.\" Becky continued with the story. \"Their coach warned them to calm down and stop yelling. Then the boy shouted excitedly to their coach, 'Come on coach, we're unstoppable!'. Then the girl walked in and said hi. All of her teammates froze, and the boy turned around. When he did, the grin slid off of his face. The girl told them good luck, said she'd be cheering for them, and left.\" Then Junior interrupted her and took up the story. \"All of the team was worried. They didn't think they could do it without the girl. But they went out there and tried. By halftime, they were getting their butts kicked, they were disappointed, and they wanted to quit. But their coach cheered them all up and got them excited to go back out there.\" Becky took the story back now. \"During halftime, the girl was worried too. She didn't see how her team was going to pull off a win. But now, they were improving. Then, all of a sudden, the best player on the Cowboys cheated. \"WHAT!\" \"Dannie, calm down.\" \"But, Joey and Daddy are in here now!\" \"That doesn't mean you can start yelling.\" \"But he's cheating!\" Junior chimed in. \"It's okay Dannie, it's actually kind of good that he cheats.\" \"How?\" \"Keep listening.\" \"So, after a really good hit by the boy, the ref blew the whistle so the players knew it was the end of that play. Then the bad player on the other team, named Spike, ran up behind the boy as he was getting up and hit him in the back. This was scary for their team since he was their best player. Now they were really going to lose. When Spike was walking back to the line, he grinned at the girl and started laughing. This made her very mad and she dropped her pom-poms and she went back to get her pads. As she walked past the boy sitting on the bench, he gave her his helmet and said to kick some butt.\" \"Yay!\" \"So, eventually they tied the score up and they all stopped Spike on the last play as he tried to make a touchdown. Now there was only four seconds left in the game.\" \"And the boy on the sidelines was getting nervous. He desperately wanted to win but they had to go 99 yards and they had one chance. Their coach called a time out and the whole team talked and decided to go for it. The boy wanted to go back in the game and their coach let him. They ran the play and they started running down the field— \"and they scored!\" Becky interrupted Junior as he was talking. \"Hey! I wanted to say that part!\" \"Well, I beat you too it.\" \"I still don't see how that was a love story, Mommy.\" \"Well I'm almost done.\" \"But do they get together?\" \"You're even more impatient than your mother is.\" \"Hey!\" \"Would you please finish the story Mommy?\" \"Yes. So, everyone was screaming and yelling on their team since they won. The girl and the boy grabbed each other's hands and started jumping up and down saying, 'we won, we won, we won!'. \"Aww. They're so cute!\" Becky smiled at Junior. \"Yeah, they are.\" \"So what happened next?\" \"Well, they were still friends throughout the years until the year they were 15 and the boy screwed everything up.\" \"Did he go out with the cousin?\" \"No!\" said Junior, kind of offended that his daughter would think he'd do that. \"And, Becks? How exactly did the boy 'screw everything up'?\" \"He asked the girl out on a date.\" \"Awwww.\" \"Yep. But eventually they broke up.\" \"What! Why?\" \"They were growing apart from each other and it just wasn't working.\" \"Mommy?\" \"Yes?\" \"That was the worst love story you've ever told me.\" Junior began to laugh. \"It wasn't the best ending for the story, Becky.\" \"Well, maybe I should finish it then.\" \"That wasn't the end?\" \"No! That would be a terrible ending!\" \"Okay good. Keep going.\" \"So, the boy and the girl finally got back together and the boy proposed to the girl after a while and they got married and had children and lived happily ever after.\" \"Aww. Yay! That was a much better ending Mom.\" \"Well good.\" \"I have a question though.\" \"What is it, honey?\" \"Do you know the boy and girl?\" Becky and Junior smiled at each other. \"I'd like to think that we do.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"We're the boy and girl, Dans.\" \"Whoah! No way. The girl in the story was really cool!\" \"Hey! What is that supposed to mean, missy?\" \"You're not that cool!\" said Dannie in shock. Junior started laughing at his wife. \"Hey!\" \"I mean, she was awesome! She completely saved the day after the boy messed up! I could see the boy being Daddy, but not you being the girl!\" \"Hey!\" Junior was, once again, offended. \"I didn't mess up! Spike ran into me, deliberately, after the play was over!\" Now it was Becky's turn to laugh. \"Okay, time for bed Dannie.\" \"You know what Mommy?\" \"What, sweetie?\" \"I really can see the girl being you.\" \"Thanks, Dannie. Good night, I love you.\" \"Love you too, Mommy. Good night Dad. Night Joey!\" \"Oh, Joes, you have to be tired.\" Becky told her son as Joey shook his little head no and rubbed his eyes. \"I'll get him, Becks.\" Becky wrapped the covers around her daughter, kissed her, and said, \"Good night little princess.\" \"Night Mommy.\" Becky went back to her room and waited for Junior to finish putting their way too tired son to sleep. Junior came in a few minutes later. \"That was a good story, Icebox.\" \"Thanks, Floyd.\" \"You were awesome that day.\" \"I know. And I completely saved your butt.\" \"What? Spike slammed into me!\" \"Good night Junior. I love you.\" \"I love you too Becky.\" He kissed her, turned off the light, and they fell asleep.

Icebox knew he was acing weird. The entire team, including coaches, knew he was acting weird. The question was, why? He couldn't look at Icebox lately, let alone pass to her or tackle her like he usually did. A few years ago she would've cockily assumed he was scared of her, but since puberty hit even she has to admit he could easily take her on. He was twice her size, even the smallest guys on the Little Giants were these days, and they usually loved lording it over her. She didn't play on the team in any official capacity anymore, but she was at every practice, and it'd never been a problem 'til now. The only conclusion she come could to was that he didn't want to hurt her because she was a girl and that, she decided, was a total bullshit excuse. That's why, when he headed into the locker room midway through another argument with Junior, she followed him in. He didn't notice her coming until she kicked him in the back of the knees, knocking him off balance. \"See,\" Icebox growled angrily, standing over him with her feet planted on either side of his upright body. He sat there rigidly as she fisted his shirt in one hand and yanked his face to an inch of hers, \"I don't care if I am a girl or how huge you are; I thought we got over this 'Spike doesn't play with girls' BS. \"We are,\" he confirmed, \"You know we are. That's not the problem at all.\" \"Well you're are going to tell me what your problem is, or I will beat it out of you,\" she returned, crossing her arms grumpily when he made no move to reply, \"You've been so acting strange lately.\" \"Don't know what you're talking about, babe,\" he shrugged, forcing a smile. Icebox glared up at him and tackled him to throw him off-balance, \"Stop avoiding the issue. I thought we were getting to be friends Spike, and now you can't even look at me!\" He was flat on the ground beneath her, and she settled on his torso to land a few blows on his chest and face, aiming to get a response out of the broad boy. She stopped when he didn't react, and she straightened her back. He finally found it in himself to look at her, and found her frowning in concern. He took a deep breath, but said nothing. Icebox knew something was seriously wrong now. \"Are you okay?\" she asked quietly, trying a different approach. She place her hand flat on his chest, over his heart; he was breathing evenly but his heart was beating erratically. She bent her ear to confirm her concerns. As she did, his eyes began to travel downward, taking in the way her toned legs spread out on either side of him. Icebox had developed quite a bit since their Pee Wee days, and had grown long and lean, with strong muscles, but she certainly wasn't shaped like an Icebox anymore. Stop it , he clenched his jaw, Stop looking . \"You're flushed,\" she murmured, eyeing him some more, \"Are you sick?\" When she leaned forward to check his forehead temperature, his line of vision was altered and he was definitely starting to feel hot. Just then, Spike snapped. He couldn't take it anymore. He was probably having a psychotic break, but frankly he didn't care. He flipped them over in an instant and melded his frame to hers, pressing their hips together. Disoriented, Icebox's concerned frown became confused as she pushed against his shoulder. \"What are you—\" Spike silenced her with an open kiss, roughly claiming her lips. He knew she was going to kill him as soon as she came to her senses, and that Junior and the rest would follow suit as soon as they heard, but he couldn't stop. He kissed her lips and ran his hands up and down her slim waist, and he wished she would make him stop, because he couldn't. At first Icebox was surprised when he had flipped their positions, and then she became uncertain when she noticed that his eyes were glazed over with—with— something , and then she felt a myriad of confusing emotions when he started kissing her. She had slammed her fist into his chest at first, but the fight seeped out of her as she realized that his hands were exciting her and she caught herself kissing him back. \"Tell me to stop, Icebox- Becky,\" Spike corrected himself in between frenzied kisses, \"Becky, tell me to stop and I will.\" \"You don't have to,\" she gasped into his mouth, not quite registering what she was saying or doing, \"Don't.\" Her arms seemed to move of their own accord, and she wrapped them around his back and admired his muscles under her touch. They parted for air and Spike moved his lips down to her neck, feeling the heat of Icebox's shallow breaths on the side of his face. His hands wandered lower and he gripped her hips as he gave a hard thrust of his hips, grunting as his jeans chafed against his growing arousal. He breathed heavily between his teeth as she thrusted into him this time, eliciting a guttural moan from deep within his throat. She purred in response and he just about died on the spot. \"Fuck,\" Spike cursed, pressing his forehead into the crook of Icebox's neck, body tense with pleasure but unable to ignore the growing sense of dread, at what he was doing, and how it would end. \"Fuck, sorry, I don't know what I'm—\" Goddammit, he thought to himself , I'm so stupid, I ruined everything. Junior's gonna kill me; forget Junior, Becky's gonna kill me! \"It's okay,\" Icebox said, wrapping her arms loosely around him and pressing a kiss to his cheek, \"It's okay.\" Spike hadn't expected such a composed response to his unprecedented actions, but he said nothing and focused on keeping his shit together. He closed his eyes, feeling the thrum of his heartbeat begin to slow down, and waited until he was breathing steadily again before he spoke. Icebox shifted under him and Spike rolled off of her immediately, not wanting to risk any more hip movement before he ended up tearing her clothes off. Apparently everything they say about hormonal teenage boys is true, he was really struggling to control himself. Icebox propped herself up on her elbow and eyed him seriously, \"You gonna tell me what all this was about?\" Spike met her gaze and blinked slowly, \"I'm not sure I really know what that was about myself.\" Icebox nervously bit her lip. She wouldn't deny the fact that he was a good looking guy. When he wasn't snarling or smirking, he could be quite cute, Lord knows the other girls at school seemed to think so. She wasn't interested in Junior anymore, they were step-siblings now, after all, and there were times when she would catch herself looking at Spike the way she used to look at him. Sometimes her gaze would lingering on the way his smile would spread slowly across his face and quirk a little crookedly to one side. There were times when she made more physical contact than necessary, there were a lot of those times, if she was being honest. There were times when she would compare him to the the other boys on the team and at school, picking at the differences in their relationships and wondering— if there might be something there, between them. They stared at each other for a while, each considering their situation, before Spike hesitantly opened his mouth, \"Look at me, Becky.\" That confused Icebox thoroughly, nobody called her Becky, \"Why are you staring at me like that?\" \"I always stare at you like that,\" Spike sighed, knocking his head against the tile of the locker room floor, not caring how fully disgusting it was. Icebox lips parted slightly as she studied his distressed expression and waited for him to continue. \"I always stare at you like that, I can't help it. I wish I could, but I can't. It's subconscious at this point,\" he said, \"And it hurts to look at you. I mean, I feel it in my chest. Especially when we're fighting, or you're playing, and your eyes light up.\" Spike paused and couldn't keep an embarrassed flush from creeping up his neck, he didn't talk like this. Meanwhile, Icebox was still studying his features, trying to weigh her options and wondering if she was being punk'd or something. \"Is that all?\" she asked, \"My eyes light up when we fight, so you kissed me? What am I supposed to say about that?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, before shyly reconsidering, \"No.\" \"Wadda ya mean?\" she was chewing on her lip now, she always did when she was nervous or confused, and he wished he could tell her how it drives him crazy. \"I've had dreams about you,\" he hesitated, \"Wet dreams, of you and me, and, honestly, that scares me.\" \"Since when?\" Icebox asked with a slight tremor to her voice. \"A few weeks ago,\" he confirmed, and a heavy silence hung around them as Icebox contemplated this. Suddenly, Spike was consumed by shame. \"I'm sorry,\" he mumbled, distraughtly, \"I didn't mean to…\" I didn't mean to mess us up, please don't hate me. \"Well, do you feel better now?\" Icebox spoke up after a moment of silence, her bright eyes piercing into his. \"…Yes?\" he confirmed, unsure if that was reassuring to her or not. \"Good,\" she said, finally, laying down beside him quietly. \"Do you mind?\" Spike asked uncertainly. \"Mind what?\" she asked. \"That I feel this way,\" he grazed his fingers against hers, \"about you.\" \"…I don't know,\" she replied, not pulling away, \"Give me some time to think, geez.\" She watched him as he moved to lean over her again. \"Can I kiss you?\" he asked in a whisper. Icebox swallowed thickly and nodded in response. This time, when Spike kissed her, slowly and deliberately, she didn't even hesitate before kissing him back.

But the plot is mine. I Think I'm Too Late: A Little Giants Fanfiction Becky's POV: It was four years after the Little Giants had defeated the Cowboys, and my crush on my best friend, Junior Floyd, had developed. I constantly wanted to tell him how I felt, but I would make up every excuse and ignore all chances. But I never really thought about our parents' growing relationship, until one night when my dad popped the question. Realizing that I didn't have a lot more time, I decided I had to tell Junior. But, scared as I was, I waited until the day of the wedding. It barely took me anytime to get ready, so I set out to find him assuming it would be easy. But all the rooms looked almost exactly identical. For at least half an hour straight I searched. Just as I was about to give up I heard this, \"Becky?\" I turned around to see him . His eyes seemed to sparkle as he stood, dazed, in his black tux. \"What?\" I blurted out when he didn't say anything else. \"You look…great,\" He whispered as we walked towards one another. \"Oh…thanks, you too,\" I said. I was gonna tell him that I liked... WAIT no lo… This was going to be harder than I thought. \"Thanks…uh Becky?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I…I'm really glad you're gonna be my stepsister.\" He smiled but my heart stopped. Sister…brother and sister… me and… Junior. Well, at least he couldn't have any chance at dating Debbie anymore; soon enough he'd be her cousin too. Unable to speak, I smiled a weak smile and nodded. We both seemed to hesitate before turning to walk away from one another. But I hesitated again… I had to know. \"Junior?\" I asked turning back toward him. Once he turned back around and our eyes locked, I began to speak again. \"If we weren't going to be brother and sister, would you date me?\" His face broke out into an angelic smile. \"This may sound weird, but I would date you, even though we're going to be brother and sister.\" Wait…did he just…? \"You…want to date me?\" I asked confused. \"Yeah, I do Becky. Will you?\" \"D-date you,\" I stuttered out still confused. He shook his head, splitting my heart. \"Be my girlfriend,\" he whispered sweetly, but demanded at the same time. I nodded beginning to smile and hugged him hard. I held on like I wouldn't, and couldn't, let go. \"Geez, Icebox,\" He said laughing. I laughed too, hearing my old nickname, and punched him softly in the chest. Reluctantly, I realized there was still something I had to say. \"Junior, I… I love you,\" I whispered, closing my eyes so I wouldn't see his expression. I prepared myself to let go of him, just as his grip tightened on me. \"I love you too, Becky,\" He whispered back. Then, he moved my long, dark hair behind my ears and held my face. I stroked his right cheek and ran my fingers through his shoulder length, blonde hair. Slowly we leaned into each other and softly kissed. We would have stayed that way too, if it wasn't our parents' wedding day. \"I'll see you later?\" Junior asked. \"Junior, I'm in the wedding,\" I replied, rolling my eyes. \"I know,\" He whispered. He kissed my forehead and smiled his beautiful smile again. \"I love you,\" We whispered to each other at the same time. The happiness seemed to stream from our eyes. Sadly, I only wish this had happened. I really did search for him, and he really did find me. He really did tell me I looked good, and I really did tell him he did too. He really did say, \"I…I'm really glad you're gonna be my stepsister.\" I really did hesitate when we turned to leave, and looked over my shoulder and called, 'Junior.' But when we locked eyes I said this, \"I'm really glad you're gonna be my stepbrother.\" He smiled his flawless smile and said, \"See you after the wedding?\" I nodded, as he left, blinking back the tears in my eyes; glad we were distanced enough that he couldn't see them. The whole time I repeated in my mind, I ' m too late … I ' m too late . Note: In your reviews answer this: Do you think it's inappropriate for step siblings to date and possibly get married later?

The late summer sun was starting to set and she should have been half way home by now but instead she was perched atop the steepest hill in Urbania, waiting. She twisted the rubber grips on the handles impatient. She hated waiting for him. At least it was nice out, a soft warm breeze was washing over her, calming her jumping nerves and rustling the leaves in the trees all around her. Cherry hill was probably her favourite spot in the entire town, waiting on the crest of the hill felt like being on top of the world. She could see over the tops of the oak trees at the bottom, she could see the lake off to the left partly hidden behind the jagged teeth of the roofs. The sun was getting low and the sky behind her was starting to purple working its way slowly to a beautiful navy colour, streaks of orange sliced through the trees sending large shadows across the slopped asphalt. Where was he. She tapped the peddle of her bike with one sneaker and sighed heavily. She slumped over resting her chin on her folded arms, rocking the bike back and forth. Almost rocking the bike over the crest of the hill. She hated waiting but winning was worth it. She beat him down the hill almost every time. Probably a good 80% of the time she would skid around that last corner and let her bike swing out from under her so she could watch his face fall and his eyes narrow when he saw that he had lost again. They had raced down the hill the first time neither realizing they were racing each other until they were half way down the hill. He hadn't been going home, his house was on the other side of Cherry Hill. There was no reason for him to take this round a bout route home everyday since. But he did and she loved it. She loved the rush of the wind through her hair as she sped down the hill there handlebars almost tangling with the closeness of the race. He would laugh and it was honest and no were near the cruel brutal laugh she usual heard, his laugh and his words would get thrown around in the wind and even the thought of the sincere beautiful laughter dancing around her in the wind brought a smile to her face. Sometimes if he was in a really good mood, when the race had been especially close or when he won he would treat her to a soda on the way home. So as much as she loved winning and the rush of satisfaction it brought she always had a good time. It was hard to say out loud but she thought that she probably liked him. Maybe just a little. But maybe it was the magic of how the light hit him when he rolled his bike next to hers. Maybe the expanding feeling in her chest was just the magic of Cherry Hill. She could hear the distinct sound of bike tires turn the corner behind her quickly. Becky stretched and yawned making a show of how long he had made her wait as she turned to look at him. \"Took you long enough.\" She smirked as Spike slid his bike up next to hers. Inches away, their legs almost touching. \"I thought I told you I had detention with Halmen?\" His voice was low for their age. Low enough to be dark and subtle not low enough to be silly. It was pleasing to her ears. At least it was when they were alone like this. When the low words held some sort of secret comradery. \"You didn't.\" she smirked and pushed her hair back behind her ears. Spike loved this hill. Cherry Hill was probably his favourite place in the whole town, possibly the whole world. There was something just so perfect about this particular slope. How if you were standing at the top at the right time the setting sun sliced through the trees in a breathtaking way. What he liked most about turning the corner and seeing the crest of the hill was that she was always waiting. Always no matter how long he was held after class or what she had to do after school, she was always there. Waiting for him, rather impatiently but that wasn't really the point. He loved making her wait. Sometimes he stopped just around the corner where he could still see her through the trees and watch her. The way the dieing sun stained her skin, the way she would shift around impatient but wouldn't leave. He could hear her talk quietly to herself sometimes, never about anything really important but her voice had a calming softness to it that he never heard in her voice anywhere else. He didn't have detention with Halmen. He had sat on his bike around the corner watching her wait for him. There was something so wonderful about how she waited. It proved something. What they did together was important enough to her not to throw away. She didn't race home, she wouldn't race anyone else, this was something they alone shared. The Cherry Hill magic, she was only willing to share with him. He smiled and watched her shift on her bike getting ready to throw herself down the hill. He laughed quietly judging the distance and the speed he would need to hit in order to win. He loved when he won, when he won he got to spend more time enveloped in the magic of Cherry Hill. On those days the magic of the hill would stretch to the dinner and would blanket them in a friendship they usually didn't share as they drank soda's and talked about nothing. He loved the ring of the bells above the door of the dinner. How on those days the bells sang out his victory and Becky would smiled and laugh at all his stupid victory jokes. They would walk into the dinner together and Wilbur and Orville would greet them with a comment about how Spike must have won today and Becky would laugh and clap Spike on the back and promise that she would win next time. He loved winning, he just wished it happened more often. As much as he hated to say it she distracted him, sure she was good but she wasn't that good, to beat him almost every day. They would get half way down the hill and the sun would play in her hair and something would tighten in his chest. He liked her. A lot. And he knew it wasn't the magic of Cherry Hill because in school sometimes he found himself looking at her for no reason and wondering what she was talking about, or writing. He hoped that maybe the magic was working on her. \"You ready?\" He asked her quirking an eyebrow taking in her determined focus. \"Always.\" she smiled brightly not taking her eyes off the hill, \"On three?\" \"One.\" Spike gripped the handlebars tightly praying to whatever was listening to let him win today. \"Two.\" Becky firmly planted her foot on the peddle closest to Spike. \"Three!\" They yelled together and pushed off, propelling as fast as they could down the steep hill. The tree lined street of Cherry Hill flew past them a blur of sun stained trees and deep blue shadow. The corner was coming up, this was where Becky almost always pulled out in front, maybe because she was lighter maybe because she always took the inside leaving him the longer outside turn. Somewhere in Becky the adrenaline and endorphins kicked her into overdrive and she sped around the inside corner. Laughing happily she skidded to a stop turning to watch Spike glide around the corner already knowing that he had lost. \"That was great!\" Becky smiled stretching out her face flushed, her body hot. \"Yeah.\" Spike's voice was quiet and perhaps sad. He let his bike roll up and smash into hers, locking them temporarily together. He leaned forward on her handlebars, incredibly close to her. They had never been this close without football pads on and one of them covered in mud. It felt electric. \"So...\" Becky looked at her watch and Spike sat back, leaning on the back of his seat. This was where they would say goodbye. This was where his, you won this time comment would go. But something was off. He could feel it in the sudden coolness of the air. \"So?\" \"Soda? On me this time?\" She was looking everywhere but at him. She didn't think she could continue to breath if he said no. He leaned down and untangled their bikes, \"Sure.\" he willed his voice to stay steady to not seem happy or excited by the prospect. He wanted to be cool, aloof even but maybe above all he wanted to hold her hand. He dismounted and started to walk his bike toward the dinner. Becky dismounted and followed close behind watching as his free hand swung slightly mimicking the uneven path of the bike. They leaned their bikes up against the window and went in. The bells sang out above his head and he couldn't help but look up at them. \"Win again Spike?\" Wilbur asked happily from the booth he and Orville always shared. Spike kept looking forward, \"Not this time.\" He wondered if he was blushing as he walked past the old men. \"You won Icebox?\" Orville laughed, \"We barely ever see you when you win.\" Becky cleared her throat knowing very well that she was blushing, \"Umm yeah.\" she followed Spike to the back of the dinner, stopping briefly to order their drinks. She sat down across from him and wondered what they talked about last time they had soda's together. Now that this was perhaps something more than a victory drink with an almost friend she had no idea what to say or even what to do with her hands. Out of nervous habit she began to rip up pieces of napkin and using the spoon on the table began to launch them into the water. \"You're really good at that.\" Becky shrugged, \"I'm an O'Shea.\" She said no more as if that was all she needed to say to explain and after living in Urbania a couple of years it really was. It seemed that Danny was the only true O'Shea that wasn't athleticly talented, even Debbie, Kevin's daughter was a cheerleader and Priscilla ran track when she wasn't doing something for the audio visual club. \"Is that how you win all the time? You're just a genetic masterpiece?\" \"I wouldn't say masterpiece.\" she smiled slightly hitting the spoon and watching another piece of napkin plop into the water, \"Then again.\" He laughed, it was that sincere honest laugh she liked so much. She looked up and their eyes locked. \"I like when you laugh.\" The words where out before she could think of the consequences. \"I like when you wait for me.\" was his response. He didn't like being soft but if there was anyone who was allowed to see him blush or hear his slightly girly words it was her. The girl who waited. \"What do you mean?\" \"You wait for me on the hill every day. I like that you don't go rushing off and forget about me.\" He didn't say it but he thought that if he turned that corner and she wasn't there he would die. \"I like when you win.\" she blurted it out hitting the spoon and sending another piece of napkin into the glass. \"What?\" \"I like when we come here after and we talk about nothing. Sometimes I wish you'd walk me home.\" She was thankful when the soda's finally came and she could stick the straw in her mouth and not have to talk. \"Okay.\" he told her, his low voice wavering with a nervousness that he loathed, his face was probably red and he hated that too. They drank their sodas in silence breaking it every once and a while to fill the silence with a rumour or funny story that had nothing to do with either of them. Becky left the money on the table and they left the dinner, quiet in the dusk. Spike started rolling his bike in the direction of her house. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'm walking you home Ice Chest, or are you so unfamiliar with the concept-\" She punched him in the arm. \"Shut up, you jerk.\" Her words held none of the sharpness that they usually did when she called him names. He was smiling and they laughed quietly together making fun of each other like they always did. The magic of Cherry Hill followed them taking out the bite in their words and replacing it with what may have been affection. Spike stood with his bike on the street in front of Becky's house and watched as she dropped her bike on the front lawn next to Juniors. \"See you tomorrow.\" she smiled watching him mount his bike. \"I'll win tomorrow.\" \"We'll see about that.\" \"Wait for me?\" \"Always do.\" she turned embarrassed by her words even if they were true.

I'll do my best so…enjoy? Disclaimer: I do not own the Little Giants or anything else recognized. But the plot is mine. You're What's Bugging Me: A Little Giants Fanfiction Junior's POV: As I ran my hands through my shoulder length, blonde hair, I felt like there was this unsaid thing meant to be said between us. I couldn't be positive but if I found her, I would know. I pivoted around right as Becky went around the corner in…tears? \"Hey Becky, wait up!\" I called. But she didn't hear me. With my suspicions now confirmed, I started after Becky. I considered running after her, but knew my mom would murder me if I ruined my tux…again. I'd already wrecked my first one during a fitting; but in my defense, white tuxes might as well beg to be destroyed. I almost caught up to Becky when someone got in my way. \"Hey Junior,\" Chriped my soon-to-be cousin, Debbie O' Shea. \"Hey Debbie, I really have—\" \"Isn't this exciting!\" \"Yeah…I'll see you later 'kay,\" I said hurriedly. I glanced over my shoulder to see Debbie with her hands on her hips. An expression of slight annoyance and distress played on her face. I felt bad about my actions, but we could talk it out later. Just as I was coming up to a corner I heard Becky talking to herself in a tone both stern and dejected. \"Control yourself here, Becky. You will not cry anymore!\" \"Hey you,\" I said quietly making her jump slightly, similar to when we met. \"Oh hey, Junior,\" She said forcing a smile. \"So—\" I quickly interrupted her before she could stall.\"What's wrong?\" She shrugged. \"It's just…forget it,\" She closed her eyes with a sigh. I mentally kicked myself for being so upfront. \"You're my best friend, Becky. You can tell me anything, okay?\" I said as I took her hands in mine. She stared at the unfamiliar position of our hands. \"Junior…I can't,\" She said with a shake of her head. What was going on here?! Becky 'The icebox' O'Shea didn't act like this. She never got all over emotional…except when we talked about her mom. But that was different! \"Becky,\" I tried to keep my tone even. \"Tell me.\" We locked eyes, and I instantly felt guilty. She looked so hurt. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled with a sigh. \"It's fine,\" She mumbled back while she broke our hands apart. \"Wait Becky!\" I called as she started to walk off. \"What do want me to say, Junior?!\" \"I…I just want to know what's bugging you!\" \"Really?!\" \"Really!\" \"You,\" She whispered. \"What?!\" \"You, Junior Floyd. You!\" \"What did I do?!\" \"Nothing!\" \"Becky, you're not making any sense,\" I said in a softer tone. My sigh betrayed that I was still irritated. \"I know,\" She said also sighing. \"Just…tell me...I'll understand,\" I pleaded. \"I don't want to be your sister,\" She confessed. \"Why not?\" I asked surprised. \"Because…because I want to be your girlfriend,\" She faded off on the last words. \"Huh?\" \"I want to be your girlfriend,\" She said slowly with a big sigh. I gently tugged her towards me with a smirk. \"I want you to be my girlfriend too, Becky.\" \"…Huh?\" I could only nod in response. Her response, to my response, was to squish me to death. \"Geez, Icebox,\" I managed. She gasped while loosening our embrace. \"What?\" I asked worriedly. \"…It's just like I imagined,\" She mumbled with a slightly embarassed smile. We continued to hug each other, when Debbie hurried past us then stopped. \"The wedding starts in FIVE minutes you guys! Come on!\" She said. We both sighed. \"One sec, Debs,\" Becky responded. \"We don't have time for a second!\" \"Just one second,\" I pleaded making my blue eyes innocent. Before she could respond, we lost ourselves in each others' lips. I held onto her waist with a strong by gentle grip, while she ran her hands through my hair. We smiled at each other when we broke apart. \"Alright, let's go,\" Becky said a little flustered. \"Hey Becky,\" I whispered as we hurried behind Debbie. \"Yeah,\" She whispered back. \"I love you.\" She completely froze before I nudged her forward and whispered, 'Keep going.' \"I love you too,\" She blurted out hurriedly with smile. I hugged her towards me, just as we fell into place in the lines to walk into the chapel. Luckily we were at the end. Becky looked up at me and smiled, while I looked down at her and smiled back twice as big.

All rights go the filmmakers and Warner Brothers inc. Everyone seems to recognize that there's this...bizarre thing between Spike and Icebox. Their teammates definitely know about it first. They call it a rivalry, because they're all just kids, so what else are they gonna call it? Spike and Icebox are always competing over something, and neither of them will back down from the challenge to become the Alpha in charge. Spike still doesn't like losing to a girl, and Icebox gets in a huffy mood whenever she's outshined by the so-called 'big-head.' They argue over throws and passes. They argue over tackling methods. They argue over the last juice box left in the cooler during break. They argue over the score during practice. They argue over...well, nothing or anything, until her dad and uncle have to step in as their personal referees, and not just their coaches. And whenever their team wins—which is most of the time nowadays, since they really do have a decent and diverse system going for them—they all go out for a victory meal down at the diner, and Spike and Icebox even start to argue then too. They argue over who gets the most credit for the final touchdown that was made, and they argue over sharing their menus, over drinks, over burgers and fries verses pizza, they argue over flavors of ice-cream they should all get for dessert, they argue over their spots at the table between the other boys. Poor Junior...somehow he always gets stuck in the middle of them now because he likes talking to Icebox the most, but Spike won't leave her alone either unless he gets the last word in. Their waitress comes over with the bill and glances at Danny and Kevin, muttering that they've got some pretty rowdy kids tonight. Kevin just shrugs it off, believing that boys will be boys, and apart from that, Icebox is an O'Shea by blood, so clearly, she's not just going to roll over and play dead just for an opponent's benefit. But Danny gets the subtle hint and clears his throat loudly over the noise, directing a very pointed look at his daughter, then Spike. They both cool down, but not before Icebox can whack her hand on the back of his head mockingly, and in reaction, he swiftly kicks at her shoe in defiance. Junior rolls his eyes. Even after the Little Giants' Day of Triumph took place a full year ago and the strong bond she's made with Junior as best friends, Debbie still has her eyes set on him, and Becky surely takes notice. She tries to not let it bother her, tries to ignore it, tries to be accepting of it—though, still—a smaller, petty part of her can't help but to feel territorial. Besides, it's only human, right? Being cautious about what's yours and what could change that? So while their parents are settled in the dining room, sipping on Kevin's fine wine, and talking over the next big game coming up in one state over and how to get there by bus, Becky plays a round of Monopoly with her cousins at the living room coffee table. They engage in normal girl-talk...or what Becky assumes must be girl-talk. Aside from borrowing a bit of blush from Patty Floyd for special occasions, she's not that experienced with these sort of conversations yet. But, Debbie's mouth is on autopilot and she gossips about the rest of her cheerleader squad as if it's completely normal to do and she also throws in comments about Junior; his hair, his smile, his incredible throwing skills. And, regrettably, that's when a loose wire seems to snap inside of Becky's mind and she curtly interjects with, \"He hasn't talked to you in like a year or whatever, Debbie, and you still like him?\" Debbie was about to shake the dice, but she doesn't let them drop. She falters, her golden curled lashes fluttering in surprise back at her. Debbie's little sister, Priscilla, who's sitting next to Becky also stares at her, knowing that statement was a little abrupt and a little too sharp, and the air around them thickens with embarrassment. \"I'm sorry, Becky...,\" Debbie adds on, voice slow and yielding. Her gaze flickers over to the grownups across the way, but they're too busy to catch anything wrong. \"...I didn't think it was a big deal. Besides, I just thought...well...\" Becky shifts awkwardly. \"Though what?\" Now, Debbie's just looking at her like she's stupid or crazy. Or both. Like she's missing out on a big secret and Debbie's surprised Becky hasn't heard it yet. \"...I just didn't think Junior was the boy you actually liked.\" It's Becky's turn to glare at her like she's all lost and screwy. \"What is that s'pposed to mean?\" \"You like Junior?\" Priscilla chimes in innocently. \"That is weird.\" \"Why is it weird?\" Temper boiling, and teeth clenching, Becky struggles to keep these words simply between them so the adults won't overhear them and get involved. \"Just because I'm not pretty enough or whatnot?\" \"No, no, that's not it,\" Debbie assures her quickly, hands waving in surrender. \"We just thought you liked...Spike.\" \"Spike?\" Becky repeats, totally skeptical. Yeah Right. Sure. \"Spike Hammersmith? The one who gets on my nerves twenty-four-seven? That Spike?\" \"Well, yeah.\" Debbie nods expectedly. Becky shakes her head at them in disbelief. \"You two are nuts! I can't stand him!\" \"But that's how you knooow a boys really likes a girl,\" Little Priscilla says, forever so cute and sweet, and actually sounds wiser beyond her short years. \"They tease you.\" Debbie agrees with her. \"Yeah, Beck. See, if a boy always goes out of his way to joke around you...it probably means that he likes you, but it's supposed to be a secret, 'cause he doesn't want the other boys to know. It's like what happened two years ago—when Jimmy Fischer once pulled on my hair in class but the next day he kissed my cheek under the monkey-bars at recess.\" \"No.\" Becky states once more, protesting against the notion, and trying her hardest not to giggle at how insane (or funny) that is. \"I'm sorry...but I still say you two have to be out of your freaking minds if you think that Spike and I like- like each other!\" Patty has just poured herself a fresh cup of coffee when Danny comes strolling in through the back door with an odd, curious expression. The last time she's seen that look on his face was when the Little Giants were just catching up to Kevin's Cowboys team and he was wondering what play to call next to win. \"What is it Danny?\" \"I'm not sure. Beck's been really weird out on the field lately. I mean, she's still playing really great, like usual, but when the team's in the locker room resting or they're just having lunch break, she gets...sorta flustered and jumpy around them. And then she kicked Spike right in the shin today for no apparent reason. And hard. He definitely went home with a bruise after that one. I think...she still has a little crush on Junior yet and she feels like she has to defend him or something. Though, to be honest, I didn't expect that to last forever...especially since you and I are...you know. Closer.\" Patty hums through pressed lips insightfully. \"Maybe...it's not Junior that's really getting to her.\" \"Then, what else could it be?\" he asked her in a hushed, cautious tone. \"Is it because she's the only girl out there still? Is it too much for her now, too weird to hang out with all boys? I really thought she still wanted to play, though—\" \"Danny—\" Patty interjects, putting a calming hand on his arm, \"—As a woman who's been in her place once upon a time, I think it's one of those ...girl-things she has to figure out on her own.\" \"But why?\" Danny complains innocently. He doesn't like the sound of that. \"We're pals.\" \"But she's growing up, Danny. And one day, she'll might need her father to be there for her, not her pal. She's about the same age I was when I was...becoming...more of a woman than a girl. And all that stuff.\" \"Oh. Right.\" Danny says, following her train of thought. \"But I would've known. That hasn't happened yet.\" \"Maybe not. But that doesn't mean she's not going through a change.\" Kevin, unlike the rest of them, certainly knows it's something. It really has to be something , because hey, at the end of every day, Icebox is still a girl and Spike's a boy, and boys and girls don't always mix that well like people might expect them to. Personal things are already growing more and more complicated for kids that age as it is, and when their teenage hormones start developing on top of that, their lives become a whole raging storm of what-ifs and maybes and other possibilities. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Kevin doesn't speak out against it , just in case he is wrong. And he hates being wrong. But he's positive that he can see it ...whatever it really is. He sees it in the way Spike or Icebox only focus on tackling down each other and no one else during a drill match. He sees it in the way those two debate over stupid stuff constantly and have no concept of personal space. They get louder and louder and step closer and closer together, practically standing chest to chest, and they don't seem to care how it may look to everyone else on the field. \"Spike is always trying to showing off during practice, but I don't get why; it's not like any of us actually like hearing it anyway, right? And he thinks I never quit talking. Yesterday he was bragging about how he can lift his whole refrigerator with his bare hands! I'll believe that when I see it.\" Junior sighs for the ninth time within that ten-minute period of walking out to the field, carrying their gear. \"Icebox, look—\" \"—I mean,\" she's not even listening, \"when is he going to take the hint that he's not some bigshot Football Idol we're all gonna worship and—\" \"Icebox—,\" Junior whirls on her, hand clamping down over her wrist. \"Becky!\" She blinks out of her endless tirade. \"What?\" \"Just stop . Okay? For five minutes, just stop it.\" \"Stop what?\" She's so one-tracked minded right now that she can't even notice what he does. \"Talking about Spike.\" he emphasizes with another deep breath, \"It's all you do now.\" \"Is not!\" She looks appalled. \"Is so.\" \"Junior,\" she scoffs then, \"I can't stand him. I thought that was clear. So why would I only want to talk about him?\" \"I could ask you the same question,\" he remarks. Though before she can reopen her mouth to deny it, Spike's walking up to them. And immediately, her attention on him shifts. \"Hey, Ice Keg! We should partner up today just so I can scrape your nose into the mud! Huh, what'd'ya say? You could use a good make-over.\" Junior frowns. (Speak of the Devil.) Icebox confronts Spike head on, and Junior can't understand what that silly little smirk flashing across her face is for. She punches Spike hard in the shoulder pads and he just sniggers at her, pushing back. The force makes her stumble a little and she's about to fall. And on pure instinct, they're both reaching out before she totally went crashing down. But Spike is a second quicker than Junior and grabs her under the elbow, setting her straight. She just stares at him afterwards, unblinking, and Spike still seems amused, and that short moment between them grows quiet. For some confusing reason, Junior doesn't like it. And, maybe, he's out of line here. She's supposed to be his best friend, the one he can really count on—and now, via their parents dating each other, he's her surrogate family too basically. At least, that's what he thinks this feeling is: a protective instinct a brother would have over a sister. Then again, there could be possessiveness festering beneath that too, a kind of deeper envy that's only being triggered because the opponent here happens to be Spike Hammersmith—and no one likes losing to him. But it's Spike who actually ends up moving first, breaking the odd tension that's making Junior's gut churn, and he rotates Becky towards him again, saying, \"On second thought...she's all yours, Pretty Boy. She's too much trouble.\" \"Ha-ha, Spike, you're so funny,\" she snips. \"It sounds like you're just afraid to take me on again.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" Becky points her chin up. \"Yeah!\" \"Don't bother, airheads,\" Junior cuts in, surprising them both by how serious his tone is set. They make weird faces at him. But what for? Have they forgotten he's right there? Is he invisible? \"Save your energy for the field.\" With that, he shoves his helmet on and stalks off, approaching the bench where Uncle Kevin was shouting orders and suggestions to those who were already running their laps. Becky and Spike start to trail behind him, their footsteps sounding perfectly even with each other. It's almost a paradox, since it shouldn't really matter. There are other things in life to worry about rather than how Becky and Spike act; there are more important things like war and famine in foreign countries to focus on instead. However, their...obsession-thing with each other doesn't cease. If it was just a phase they were in, then it's a drawn-out phase that won't go away. It carries on through the end of Pee Wee Football, and stays with them till now, in high school. And the one key fact about living in Urbania is that it's not really big enough to be called a city, or even the Suburbs. It's one of those old small-town places where there's a real tightly-knit, homey feel to it. But that also means information travels quickly family to family and everyone knows everybody else by first and last names and they know all the latest gossip. So, of course, they have all long figured out by now that Becky and Spike really are friends who hang out sometimes after class, along with the rest of the boys she's friends with; they just don't care to admit it out loud to them. And, really, it's just ridiculous for them to keep acknowledging each other as 'worst enemies' in front of the group when Spike was actually invited over tonight to watch sports with them while her dad and Patty are gone for the evening to celebrate their couples' anniversary. The room is dark and Nubie is over on the end chair, Tad and Jake are lying on beanbags on the floor in front of the television screen, slowly chewing on their pizza, and Junior is next to Becky, who's sandwiched between him and Spike on the sofa. And when the current football team they're cheering for shoots everything straight to hell, Spike gets all upset and starts growling things in third-person again, demanding that they turn the channel to something else for a while before he has to get up and smash the TV set to bits. \"Relax, Bigfoot,\" Becky deadpans, \"It's only half time.\" Unsurprisingly, Spike doesn't let that comment slide, and it only turns into a one-on-one battle to win custody of the remote. And in the middle of their scuffle, they slide over the cushions, their limbs linking together—Junior falls off the sofa with a grunt, and Spike hisses in discomfort too and pulls back, glowering down at his hand. He's bleeding. It's just little cut branded into his palm from Becky's nails accidently scraping him there—because even girls like her still have nails that come naturally sharp—but he feels the sting, and its red, and oozing. The other boys gape up at them, unsure what to do and they're sort of scared to test Icebox's patience any further at that point. Becky huffs in contempt, and stands up again when Junior does as well, scolding them. She ignores him and merely extends a hand, tugging Spike towards the doorway and aims for the kitchen. \"Come on. There're bandages under the sink.\" They disappear around the corner, and that's when Nubie suggests that someone should go supervise those two so they can't finish murdering each other for good. Tad and Jake automatically vote for Junior, and in response, Junior just rolls his eyes and follows them out, stopping at the archway that faces into the kitchen. Becky and Spike are both hovering slightly over the running faucet as she reminds him to rinse off the cut first. \"You really need to start wearing a Bio-Hazard sign around your neck in public, Ice Nails...,\" Spike grumbles down at her while she bends over to rip open a Band-Aid strip from the cupboard below, \"...You know, so people can just know to stay clear of you. This might get all infected now.\" \"It's just a cut , you overgrown baby,\" she snaps back, straightening herself, and she flips her hair back behind her shoulder. She shuts the faucet off and coaxes Spike to expose his wound to her so she can press the bandage down on his skin just at the right angle. \"God. Why are boys so okay with climbing trees, and hopping fences, and getting thrown down on the field every day...or, wrestling for the remote...but one tiny scrape makes you cry death?\" \"If you'd just changed the channel, this wouldn't've happened...\" She laughs, semi-bitterly. \"Oh, no you don't. If you'd just learn to not spin outta control over the littlest of things, then we wouldn't have—\" \"Beck,\" Junior has to say quickly, before she starts screaming at Spike all over again. \"Cool off. You're fine. He's fine. Let's just go back in and watch the rest of the quarter.\" (And by their mildly humiliated expressions they both share, he can tell they had forgotten that other people are there with them. Again. That happens a lot now, actually.) The weather's bad and it's holding people up, so her dad's going to be late. Spike overhears their phone call at the front desk at school and mumbles out an offer to drive her home today. \"No, it's fine.\" \"It's a twenty-seven minute walk back on foot, Ice Pick, and the storm's just about to pick up.\" So half-reluctantly, she finally agrees, sprinting outside after him. They climb up into his old rusted pickup truck, and she shakes out her wet hair, slamming the passenger's door shut. The sky turns all dark and grey as they drive off, the pouring rain hits the windshield like falling nails and Spike stares ahead. \"Thanks,\" she suddenly feels obligated to say. \"Sure.\" She bends her knees to her chest over her seat. The rain, it makes her...it makes feel lonely and on edge. A scowl slowly forms behind her eyes. (It was storming like this when her mother had left Urbania.) \"...You okay o'er there?\" She's actually surprised that he even notices the subtle change in her posture, or that he's considerate enough to spare her a simple glance-over and ask. \"I just don't like storms,\" she replies. \"Who does really?\" Shortly after that, they pull into her driveway with a heavy sloshy sound beneath the tires and the ground's all slick with mud now. Spike shifts into park. \"Well, we're here.\" \"Yeah, I see can that, you oaf...\" There's a thick pause in conversation as she gathers up her bag and throws her sweatshirt back on with its hood up. Then, she leans back in thought and looks directly towards him. \"...The rain's getting worse right now,\" she begins, tentatively, \"you wanna wait inside until the coast is clear? It'd be safer than driving anywhere else.\" He's somewhat suspicious. \"...Are you afraid to be alone in your own house right now?\" \"No,\" she objects, hoping she doesn't sound overly-defensive. \"I just...I told you I just don't like storms. Things get wet. And boring. And my dad's gonna be late tonight anyhow, so, bugging you until he gets home will at least give me something to do.\" Spike caves, letting the real issue hidden beneath that excuse go unsaid. \"Alright, alright. Let's go in.\" For their senior class, tonight's supposed to be big, the biggest night Urbania High has ever seen yet. It's the party (emphasis on the 'e' in the), the party of the year, the party everyone wants to go to despite whether their parents like it or not. And even though it is actually hosted at Murphy's house no less, they all do show up to have a part in it. The stereo is blasting on full volume, and their fellow classmates are everywhere, dancing and whooping to the beat, flooding through the garage—to the living room—to the bedrooms upstairs. They're all basically cramped inside, constantly touching shoulders with someone else. But all the excitement somehow makes up for discomforts like that. Junior is given a can of beer by Murphy. He takes it, and opens it, though he really has no intention of drinking until he literally vomits like a few of his ex-teammates are evidently trying to do. Becky soon appears before him, with her dark waves loose and wild, her eyes are lined with black, and she's even wearing a short leather skirt and black heeled boots for the occasion. She actually receives a couple of catcalls as she weaves her way through the crowd, coming straight towards him. She smells like Debbie's signature perfume (lavender-vanilla) once she squeezes closer to allow the people stringing behind her to pass by them. \"Hey, pal,\" she beams at him, calling over the music. Her hand naturally lands on the nape of his neck to keep herself upright when they get bumped aside by another wild couple. Her current nail polish is a deep dark purple. \"Hey,\" he shouts back. \"Why aren't you dancing?\" He shrugs. \"Don't have anyone to dance with!\" \"Well, come on then!\" Her fingers slip down to take his hand in a rather casual manner, leading him into the wave of animated people. Spike walks into the room too just as they started swaying and laughing along with those moving around them. Junior notices how Hammersmith's eyes are skimming the room until they focus on them—and on Becky. She and Spike essentially end up circling each other the whole night afterwards, engaging in yet another battle of wits, serving snide comments and teasing comebacks back and forth and back and forth, and Junior's ears are ringing with their nonstop dialogue and just not the music. He looks over and he even now, he's not sure how he feels. Or should feel. But he does know watching Icebox standing over at the fence, bantering with Spike makes it harder to swallow. \"Junior?\" Debbie approaches him gently, her pompoms hanging down by her hips, brushing up against her short cotton skirt. \"Is everything alright?\" He turns away from Becky, gazing right into Debbie's bright blue eyes covered in glitter and he smiles apologetically. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Debbie nods back politely in return, though something in his instincts tell him that she knows better than that. Because, when the whole truth comes crashing in, it hits hard, with no forgiveness. And for some reason, he's worried about what's going to happen when it will finally hit Becky. Two weeks before graduation, she willingly goes to the arcade with Spike, and they play several rounds of darts while drinking cola from the old-fashioned glass bottles. Her red-tailed dart sticks really close to the bullseye, Spike's blue-tailed dart hits just a tad closer above hers. \"So are you ready for the final Lit Exam Samson's gonna give us?\" She's not trying to mock him. In truth, she's just curious. They're both all set and good in Gym class obviously, and surprisingly Social Studies and Biology aren't so difficult if the books are actually cracked open—although when it comes to hard-core poetry and other classic English works loaded with symbolism and allusions and hidden tones and reoccurring themes—she and Spike are equally hopeless. She knows that like her, he's hoping to overcome the upcoming Lit Exam with a basic C+ at best to pass. Shrugging, Spike flings his last dart. It's a perfect bullseye shot. \"...You know that one Rover Freeze poem? The one with fire and ice?\" \"It's Robert Frost ...,\" she corrects him, and throws her last dart as well. It hits the red spot right beside his. Not a perfect bullseye, but it's a mille-inch away from being one, so she thinks it counts. \"...But, yeah, what about it?\" \"Where do you fall? Fire or Ice?\" \"Ice,\" she says, not that serious about it, since she doesn't exactly understand what Frost was getting at in that poem anyhow. \"It is in my name, after all. You?\" \"I'd choose fire.\" She snorts. \"You would.\" The first month of the summer before college is not as hectic as it was originally hyped out to be. Because, really, the gang still finds the right amount of down time to relax by the motel pool every weekend, surrounded by the long-awaited blistering heat. Icebox happens to glance down from her lazy perch on the low diving board, sitting next to Debbie and Junior, and spots Spike wading in the pool below, gazing up at her, nearly smirking and nothing else. Silently, she dares to let her eyes fall to his matured shoulders, falling further to his bare fit torso, (and maybe just a few more mille-inches below that to where the hem of his shorts rest) then right when it feels like they're getting sucked into some private moment or whatever, she mercilessly kicks water right in his face. No one knows how, when, or why exactly. But in spite of it being the last day of high-school-like freedom, Junior and Spike are tumbling across the fresh-cut grass, fighting. Physically fighting, like two drunken, grumbling apes. Outraged and just so mentally exhausted with the entire male race today, Icebox pushes through the other boys who are yelling at them...some are even cheering, and she manages to insert her body in between them, one hand per chest, pressing down and pushing them apart. \"What the hell was that for?\" she shrieks at them both, her glare steely and passionate. \"Are you really gonna ruin everybody's last day home by doing this ?!\" \"Hey, don't point fingers at me,\" Spike bites back, licking at his cracked lip. \"Pretty Boy here threw the first hit.\" And though this causes her to focus solely on Junior, she's still asking Spike the questions. \"Why?\" \"Stop messing around!\" Junior orders them, and all the boys present in that instant gape towards him inquiringly. \"Stop putting us in the middle of it!\" Becky holds in a breath, stunned. He's never sounded so angry and frustrated before. Especially not at Icebox. \"Stop wasting all your time playing these games and just, please, make up your minds!\" The whole group watches him storm off into the house, slamming the screen door behind him. And the others start to whisper softly amongst them now. They're not too certain of what Junior had meant by that, or what made him blow up, but Becky has a hunch. Perhaps all the hidden things about her weren't so hidden or that secretive. It just depends on the observer apparently, and Junior, one way or another, caught sight of those things first. She breathes out slowly, hands lifting to her hips, head bowed. With another breath drawn in, she ultimately forces herself to look over at Spike, who is already staring back at her carefully, knowingly . She bites her lip. He must have the same hunch she does. It's obvious to them too, now. They need to talk. They need to decide, to explain, and figure it all out before they'd leave town and regret it later. And they only have the remaining twenty-two hours to do so. ","Summary":" I own nothing. All rights go the filmmakers and Warner Brothers inc.

This is my first story and I thought I would write about one of my favorite movies. This story is pretty much about what happens after the game. well, it does go on for days after the game, but you know what I mean! Hope you enjoy the story! Becky's P.O.V When I got home I was still thinking about all of what happened. We surprising won the game, which is so exciting and after we just won Junior and me starting holding each other's hands and jumping up and down in excitement. We had a short pause, but then we started doing it again. Everyone stayed at the field for a little while, but we were all exhausted so we went home eventually. \"I wonder if Debbie hugged Junior after the game\" I thought to myself. As soon as I though it, I let it go. I don't want anything to ruin the night. I knew that if I kept going on with that thought, worse things will come into my mind. \"Becky!\" yelled my Dad \"what!\" I yelled \"Someone's here to see you!\" He replied \"Okay coming!\" I yelled back I hopped out of my bed and headed down stairs. When I got there, I was surprised to see Junior standing in my living room. He looked so cute, but then again, he always does. \"Hey, what's up?\" I asked \"Well the team called me up earlier and said that they thought it would be a good idea if we all celebrated our win. So after some talking we decided that we're going to have a victory party tomorrow at 12 at my house. Everyone is going to be there and it would be a shame if you didn't come.\" replied Junior with a smile. \"Cool. I'll be there. Sounds like fun.\" I said returning the smile \" By the way my mom said that your dad can come to.\" He added \" Okay I'll be sure to tell him. See you tomorrow Junior\" \"See you tomorrow\" I closed the door and went into the kitchen to tell my Dad about the party, smiling the whole way. Junior's P.O.V I knocked on the door of Becky's house, hoping that I will be able to see her. The door opened with Becky's Dad standing in the doorway. \"Oh hey Junior. What are you doing here?\" He asked \"Well I was wondering if I could talk to Becky for a minute\" I replied back hopeful \"Yeah sure, come on in and I'll get her for you\" So I came in and stood in the living room waiting anxiously to see her. \"Becky!\" Yelled her Dad \"What!\" Becky yelled back \"Someone is here to see you!\" He replied \"Okay I'm coming!\" I looked up when I heard foot steps coming down the stairs. She looked surprised to see me. She looked really pretty, but then again, she always does. \"Hey. What's up?\" She said to me So then I explained to her what was going on and I added at the end that it would be a shame if she missed it. Boy, would then replied with \"Cool. I'll be there. Sounds like fun.\" I smiled at that and held in my excitement I then added \"By the way, my mom said that you're dad can come too.\" She told me that she would tell him and that she would see me tomorrow and I said the same. When she closed the door I stood there for a few seconds smiling to myself. When I was done smiling like an idiot I headed down the porch and into my mom's car. \"Why are you smiling like that?\" She asked \"Like what?\" \"Like you're really happy.\" She replied back \"Oh no reason.\" I said as I turned my head the other way to face the window \"yeah sure.\" She said with a knowing smile So what did you think?

He was an animal, he spoke in third person and was the size of an ocean liner. Okay well maybe he had stopped speaking in third person, and he did get that stupid cap off of his front tooth. And maybe he even ditched that stupid buzz cut, but he was still the jerk who thought girls couldn't play football. Right? Becky O'Shea kept trying to reassure herself that she hated Spike. Since her dad had married Junior's mother things had changed a bit. Junior most definitely wasn't the object of her affection anymore. He was her stepbrother after all, and that would just be too weird, not to mention he took longer in the bathroom than she did, his feet stunk, and he always left the cap off the toothbrush. What killed her the most was however, that since The Little Giants joined up with The Cowboys, Junior had become best friends with no other than her very own nemesis, Spike. Spike and Becky always fought, and now that he was spending more time around the house hanging with Junior, things had gotten worse. Not to mention, Spike seemed to get some sort of sick pleasure with pushing Becky's buttons. Like just the other day, Becky was minding her own business, sitting on the couch watching some random TV show that she had happened upon while channel surfing. Suddenly out of nowhere, Spike leaps over the back of the couch, settling down next to her, grabs the remote and switches the channel. Thus a war ensued. Eventually as the years passed she began to tolerate the tall brunette, he was like another brother to her...sorta. She didn't quite remember when it happened, but somewhere along the way she began to feel differently about Spike. Her whole opinion of him would change one rainy night. Spike came to the house, Junior was out with the girlfriend of the week, and her Dad and Stepmother were on their usual date. Spike was soaked to the bone with water, his eyes were bloodshot and he looked like he had seen a ghost he was so pale. Becky hurried him inside and got him some hot chocolate, a set of Juniors clothes, and a towel. She sat down next to him and asked him what had happened. Spikes father had been killed, apparently he had gone to a bar and gotten into an altercation with another guy when the man pulled out a knife and stabbed him, got him right in the artery. He died before the paramedics even got there. That was the first time Becky had seen Spike vulnerable. She held him in her arms as he cried himself to sleep. Nothing was the same between them since that night. Spike seemed to avoid her, he didn't try to annoy her, he barely even looked at her. A week after the incident Spike announced to Junior and Becky that he would be moving to Florida to live with his mother. That was was 3 years ago... Becky and Junior were now in high school, Becky had just turned seventeen, and she was the only female on the high school varsity football team. Junior was of course quarterback, he still had that amazing arm of his. Well Becky...she wasn't quite the linebacker anymore. Sure she could still tackle with the best of them, but her body had changed. Lets face it, she had boobs. She had a nice athletic figure, lean but just right. She was a running back. She was smaller than everyone else but fast and lithe. She had grown up quite well, some of her teammates might even dare call her hot. Practice was over, Becky was exhausted and very ready to go take a shower and change into her normal clothes. She met her cousin Debbie in the locker rooms, apparently cheer leading practice was over as well. Debbie was actually dating Junior, they had been together since sophomore year. It was a shock that they were actually able to stay together that long, both of them having had so many previous relationships. Becky hopped into the shower and quickly washed up, as she was dressing, Debbie popped up next to her in her negligee with a huge grin on her lips. \"I just got a Text from J...you will never guess who just drove up into the parking lot\" Becky got a look of confusion as she pulled her shirt over her head and into place. \"Who and why do I care?\" she dried out her long wavy hair and wiggled into a pair of skinny jeans. Debbie just giggled and stepped into her dress. \"Just tell me Deb.\" she was getting a little impatient. Becky wasn't one for surprises. \"Okay okay...It's Spike Hammersmith!\" Becky suddenly got pale, then red, then a weird purplish color. She leaned against her locker and tried to calm herself. \"You are serious Deb?\" Debbie nodded \"See here's the text from J\" the small blonde showed Becky the text. Becky's heart began to pound rather fast. Spike was back. Spike who she had realized after the guy had left that she liked. The guy who made her crazy and picked on her. She had gone through a small state of depression when the linebacker had left, but now he was back. He was back, and Becky was scared shitless to go out and see him. Ten minutes later after a self pep talk Becky managed to get a hold of herself and immerse from the locker rooms. She stepped out onto the field and started across the grass. In the distance she could see Junior and the back silhouette of someone tall with dark hair, clad in nice jeans and a sleek brown leather jacket. \"Hey Becks!\" Junior called out as she got closer. Suddenly the tall stranger turned around, and Becky felt her breath catch and her heart drop to the pit of her stomach. It was Spike...but he was all grown up. He flashed what could only be described as a knee melting smile as she got closer. He suddenly grabbed her in a tight hug, lifting her off the ground. Becky wiggled a little \"Spike you can put me down, I'm not a damn doll you know.\" she spit out as instinct. \"Ouch, yup she's still the ice queen\" Becky crossed her arms over her chest as he set her down. After Debbie joined them the old gang headed to the diner and hung out the whole time. Through the whole evening Becky could feel his eyes on her. It was hell trying to keep her blush down. It got a bit late and the group parted ways leaving just Junior, Becky and Spike. All of a sudden Junior piped up \"By the way Becks, Spike is going to be staying with us for awhile...at least until he finds a suitable apartment to rent.\" \"WHAT!?!\" \"I knew that would happen\" Spike said with a little chuckle.

He hadn't thought that she would be angry at him. Why was she angry? \"You just stole my first kiss!\" she had screeched. \"I thought you wanted me to...\" he mumbled. She frowned at him.

It really did. I know that's hard for the general masses to understand, but it's true. It's not all just games and money – and power – it was also responsibility, rules, respect, rules, meetings, rules, economics, rules, politics, rules, rules, and more rules! And that was only the half of it. As a prince, I was expected to uphold pride and respect. I needed to represent discipline, strength, loyalty, justice, and integrity. And besides being a figurehead of the monarchy, I had to partake in combat practice. Never mind that I had a horde of well-trained guards at my disposal or that the royal quarters were the most secure in the Vale. Sword practice in the morning, hand-to-hand combat practice in the afternoon, war strategies in the evening. Not that we were in a war, but let's just say supernatural creatures weren't always happy with each other. And yes, you did read that correctly. Supernatural , as you humans call us. In particular, I'm a fairy. Wings and all. Laugh all you want, it's true. Call me unmanly if you wish, but just know I've gotten pretty handy with my sword lately and while it might be small to you, it can easily take your eye out. Just saying. What were we talking about? Oh, yeah. My birthright. So, while we weren't at war with anybody, we had to constantly watch our backs. See, fairies aren't always well liked amongst the supernatural. Not because we're fickle little dirt bags or anything but because we hold significant influence over the land they inhabit. As fairies, we get to decide when the seasons come about – though we do have restrictions, Mother nature is not a very forgiving person – and we have the ability to cast spells, even if they aren't as powerful as witches and warlocks, but that's insignificant. Also threatening would be the sheer size of the fairy population. While we weren't all located in the same area – that would be pretty dumb of us – each kingdom far outweighed the sizes of the local mystics around. And sure, my particular kingdom wasn't the grandest but fairies were fiercely loyal to their own and if one kingdom fell under ruin, another would quickly step up and send aid. Yeah, we aren't as evil as some of you humans think we are. Seriously, why would we even want to deal with you humans? You guys always seem to have some drama going on. And you're not particularly nice to each other either. You're polite, sure, but you'd just as quickly mock a person behind their back and spread hateful gossip about a neighbor just to make yourself feel good. You're as bad as the pixies. And no, they are not fairies. We may look similar but we are definitely not the same. Forgetting the fact that they obviously lack the wings that greatly distinguish us, their ears were pointed, they dressed in green, and almost always had hats. If not, then they wore rags which they easily discarded for any new clothes they found, like those that humans set out to dry. It's them that are stealing your clothes, not us. So, stop blaming fairies. Don't let the fact that they help you with housework fool you; they just don't like messes. But they are definitely not above leading you astray in the woods if you don't know your way. They're kind of like sirens in that way. Don't worry about those though. They're extinct. Anyway, pixies aren't the worst of our potential enemies. As I said previously, witches and warlocks were more powerful than us in terms of spells. See, while our spells tended to manifest the will of Mother Nature, their spells brought forth malevolent forces against any and all who offend them. And unlike us who were limited to the amount of fairy dust we produce at any given time, witches and warlocks had unlimited access to runes, sigils, or incantations that usually lasted days or weeks at a time. Our spells lasted only moments. (you don't see the gold shine of our dust on the leaves and flowers you pick, do you? I thought so.) Let's not forget their ability to raise the spirits of the dead either. Aside from the fact that that's just beyond creepy, the spirits of the dead would be able to spy on the witches' and warlocks' enemy with only them being the wiser. Though, you can tell if a spirit is spying on you if you knew what to look for, thankfully. Also, thankfully, is the existence of white witches, the benevolent witches or \"good witch\" as you humans call them. Unlike the malevolent witches, white witches actually ask you for permission before performing their magic on you and profess ethic codes for other situations as well. They're the ones that typically traveled from village to village, town to town, seeking jobs as healers or seers, though more typically the former, and were unfortunately spooned into the same witch hunts made in retaliation to the bad witches' actions. They also acted as mediators between the mortal and the spiritual so we often consulted them when we felt threatened by those aforementioned spying spirits. They were one of the few that willingly formed allies. But anyway, I'm sure you didn't come here to hear about the allies and enemies of the fairies. You want to know about me. Well as I said before, I'm the prince. The only Prince. I have no siblings so it's up to me to continue the family tradition and become the next ruler of our little kingdom. Not to mention produce the next heir. So obviously with me being the only chance any of the ladies have into becoming part of the most powerful family in the Vale, I would frequently have to fend off the, uh, 'affections' of some of the more passionate ladies. Seriously, did these girls not have anything else to do but stalk me all day? I had to sneak out of my own home just so I wouldn't have to entertain them. Forget about it being the \"polite thing to do\" as my father says. Some of these girls hung on too hard if I gave them a brisk \"Hello.\" It seems I've veered off a bit. My bad. I realize you don't even know my name. Let me introduce myself. My name is Prince Cornelius. I'm sixteen years old. And there was no way that I could've known what was going to happen soon.[Chapter 2] Enlevé ~0~ I don't usually think of myself as a trusting person. I really don't. I've been taught and conditioned to take everything with a grain of salt because a royal can never be too careful around others, even if they seem friendly or are royal themselves. I don't even fully trust the servants that roam around our flower patch. Sure, I trust them to make my bed and help me dress but only because I can s ee what they did. I didn't fully trust the food that was handed to me by the chef, for example. Every item of food or drink had to be passed to a food taster or cupbearer before being served to my family and me. So, what possessed me to trust this particular servant I will never know. The day started off like any other. I was snoozing away in my comfortable bed made of feathers when a maid turned down a flower petal, effectively waking me up when the burst of sun invaded my quarters unforgivingly. I groan and turn my face away but a droning voice enters my ears making me dread the day already. \"Sire, did you know you're twenty minutes late for breakfast? Your parents are wondering where you are.\" I frown into my bed before turning my face to the youngest – but still pretty old – advisor of my father's court. \"I'm tired, Renard.\" \"Be that as it may, Your Highness, Your Majesties are still expecting you at breakfast.\" \"Just like yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.\" I grumble, burrowing my head into the pillow. \"If you did not spend so much time outside the Vale frolicking about who knows where than maybe we wouldn't be having this conversation.\" I roll my eyes but get up anyway as the maid and the old goot leave my room. I stretch and see my outfit for the day laid out on a chair nearby. Normally I would have servants help me dress but I refused to have any help years ago. For one, I would have more chances to sneak out without servants coming into my room at all hours of the door. For two, having two or more servants help me get into pants and a shirt was just weird. It's not like I had ties on my back I couldn't reach or something. Today must be a special day or something because the outfit chosen was in the colors of the royal seal. An orange vest with striped puffed shoulders – I hate that design – long yellow sleeves and tan pants. At least I kept my usual boots. My parents seem to love putting me in clothes that blend with the family's famous auburn hair. Ugh. Whatever. I'm hungry. I'll wear the stupid clothes if they want me t—Woah. I look good. Oh yeah. Oh no. Damn. I look good. I'll have to sneak away again tonight. Ugh. I scowled. It's not that I like being around my parents or their little court all day but it'd be nice if I didn't have to sneak out and avoid my own house because of stupid squealing girls. Don't get me wrong, though. Some of these girls were definitely easy on the eyes and the fact that they only had eyes for me was great. Except that they only had eyes for me . These girls were fun to entertain the first time but they became too clingy the second time I met with them. It's like having that one friend that only had you for a friend so they clung onto you like a leech and stuck to you everywhere whenever. Trust me it may seem amazing to you but after hearing the same squealing voice for days at a time the moment you stepped off your flower, you'd be begging for escape like I was. Not to mention the thrill you'd get every time you discover a new way to pass by the guards announced. I love watching the guards wonder how exactly I leave the Vale almost every time, especially as they change the patrols every other day just to catch me unawares. Jokes on them. I'll never reveal my secrets. My parents know better than to ask me how I do it and where I go. They know I won't answer them. But that doesn't stop them from asking me when I was going to settle down with a 'nice girl already'. I pick at my food as my father starts to speak. \"Come on, son. I hear that Salene girl has a wonderful reputation among the noble families. She's humble, sweet, smart…\" \"And her blood!\" My mother gushes. \"She comes from a long line of dukes and duchess'! The oldest family here to hold such titles.\" \"Yeah, and she also can't shut up about how wonderful her outfits look or how excited she is about the next ball and about who's courting who…\" I point out. Mother cuts me off. \"At least, she knows more than you about what's going on here. Where were you last night?\" I guess I was wrong. What a drag. \"Here and there.\" I answer with a smirk. \"Here and there?\" I can see my mother's face get red. \"You can't just go off by yourself all willy nilly! You could have been killed! And then what? We're just supposed to be okay with that?\" \"I do not go off all willy nilly! I bring my sword with me and Buzzby.\" \"And do you even know how to use that sword of yours? Don't think I don't know you've been ditching your lessons, young man.\" \"Oh, come on, Mother! Why can't you understand that I don't want to waste my life going to lessons and meetings and court hearings?\" I growl. \"And why can't you understand that as the crown prince you have certain abilities to uphold! What will the court think seeing the future King ditching his duties!\" My mother responded immediately. \"Court, court, Court! Is that all you think about?\" \"I think you two need to calm down…\" I hear my father say. Mother cuts him off too. \"No! If he has something to say, he should say it right now.\" \"Tabitha…\" \"Fine. Mother—\" I stress the word \"—We're the royal family. We lead the fairies. They look up to us. I get it, I do. But I'm sixteen years old, Mom. I don't want to be stuck inside learning how to calculate taxes or sitting in on a meeting where a bunch of men talk to each about how best to strategize in case of war or how to organize the guards, how to keep public relations with other kingdoms! I just want a day to myself.\" Mother raises her eyebrows and closes her eyes slightly. Father sighs next to us, ignored. \"A day? A day to yourself? That's what you want?\" I nod my head aggressively. \"We can't have the next heir go missing for an entire day without reason.\" \"Fine. A few hours every day. Come on I'm going crazy being stuck here!\" I can see her thinking about it and I wait anxiously until she slowly places her palms down on the table and looks up. \"Okay. A few hours of recreation. We can do that. Two hours after lunch. Three hours after dinner. Alright?\" \"Yes, Mother,\" I say, sitting back with a sigh. \"Finally,\" I mutter under my breath. \"Oh, good. Glad that's settled.\" I glance over at my father. \"Well,\" Mother says. I sigh internally and pick my fork back up. \"This is certainly not the morning I was hoping for.\" \"Sorry for being such a disappointment.\" I mutter sarcastically. \"My sunshine, how could you say that?!\" \"Son, whatever gave that idea?\" I look up at my parents and scowl a little. \"Nothing. I was being sarcastic.\" Seriously? How could they not hear that? \"Even if that's true, I still don't want to hear it.\" I'm sure if the table wasn't so large, my mother would have bent over the table to grab my hand. \"You must know that whatever faults you think you have we will always love you.\" Father frowns and leans forward concerned. \"Son, if there's anything at all you want to talk about, you can always come to me, alright?\" I wave away their concerns. \"Yeah, yeah. I get it. I wasn't being serious. Ok? I won't say that again.\" I stare them down until they seem satisfied and return to their food. I shake my head at how they can switch from angry or resigned to worry warts at a drop of a hat. I wasn't being serious at all. Thankfully, they seemed content to eat the rest of the course in silence as we all think to ourselves. Hopefully, those \"recreational hours\" Mother was talking about start today. The last time I went out with Buzzby I came across a human settlement that seemed interesting. I mean, as far as I can see, the humans were just a bunch of farmers and crop growers but they seem to all congregate in this one area with a lot of those stick and stone buildings. One of those seemed to be particularly interesting as I saw dozens of humans come in and out of there the two hours I was there. And they didn't come out looking \"all there\" either. Did humans have something similar to the boyair we have here? You know? The fermented drink that burns as it goes down and leaves its victim dizzy and acting stupid? If they do, I want to see if it tastes any different to boyair. Humans won't notice if a drop goes missing. My train of thought is lost as I hear my mother speak up again. \"I still wish you'd pick a girl already.\" Oh. My God. \"Seriously? Mother, we have to do this now?\" \"Well, it's not like we're getting any younger, dear. I just want to see you settled down with the right girl.\" \"And you think one of those girls that throw themselves at me is the right one?\" I scoff. \"Not likely.\" \"If you don't like any of those girls than why didn't you just say so?\" \"I did! You said I couldn't possibly have met every girl and to come to you later.\" I try not to roll my eyes in annoyance. \"It seems I did say that,\" She returns holding a finger to her chin. Now I roll my eyes. \"Well, since it seems we're just full of compromises today, how about we make a deal? We send you to different kingdoms, and you can frolic about wherever you wish, if you promise to seriously consider any of the princesses or young ladies of the Courts. Agreed.\" Get a new playground and freedom in exchange for spending a few hours with pretty girls? As long as they didn't start stalking me, it's not bad. Not bad at all. \"Okay.\" I see my parents sigh in relief. \" But …I take Buzzby with me.\" Mother practically has a heart attack in her chair. \"That wretched thing?\" \"Yes.\" \"No!\" \"Yes!\" \"You could get hurt!\" \"And how many times has Buzzby let me get hurt?\" \"Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't ever happen.\" There is no winning with my mother on this. I look at my father for help. \"Tabitha… Let the boy have his bee.\" Father chimes in, coming to my rescue. Father always seemed to choose his battles, but no one could say he was a terrible ruler. It may come as a surprise to many that the just and quiet ruler used to be as daring and adventurous as me. Although, Mother insists he wasn't as reckless as I am. I can't really picture my Father as being like me, though, even if he was the one to first show me how to ride on Buzzby, my bumble. Yes, Buzzby is a bumblebee. Don't laugh. He's the best damn bumble for miles around. I tune back in to the conversation in time to hear \"If you insist on taking the bumblebee than you're also taking some guards with you.\" Typical. \"Never in a million years would I expect to go anywhere without you sending guards after me.\" \"It's not a crime to worry about my child.\" She dabs at her mouth with a napkin. \"Ok. Enough talking. We have a big day planning the Solstice Festival and I have to find out which kingdoms have plenty of eligible ladies.\" She stands up and calls for her ladies-in-waiting. \"Genevieve? Cecelia?\" No answer. Mother's eyes furrowed. \"Genevieve? Cecelia?\" Still no answer, which was unusual as they liked to stick close to the Queen. And it's not like the flower walls were extraordinarily thick either. Something's wrong. I can see my father shift and stand with eyes furrowed himself. I see him lock eyes with my mother as he walks close to her. \"Do you hear that?\" he whispers to her. For a second, I'm confused at what he's talking about until I pay closer attention and hear it myself. Faint yells were coming from the town. Just as suddenly as I heard that I could also hear from just outside our flower: \"We're being attacked!\" I watch horrified as we immediately hear what must have been the same man cut down by the spear that penetrated the petal making up the back wall. As if that was the signal to everyone outside, our little safe haven is ambushed by a fleet of creatures I'd never seen before. I don't even know if you could call it a creature as they looked more like humanoid shadows that moved into the room like water down a river. Whatever they were, they were still penetrable as I immediately withdrew my sword and lunged toward the closest one. I could see out of the corner of my eye my father join in the foray as he protected my mother. Two ambushed me at once and my sword clinked against the spears they used to try to impale me. Being that spears are made to be thrown from a distance toward the intended target, I try to convince myself that these whatever-they-are are not good at hand-to-hand combat or close-range combat but the fact that I can feel bruises forming on my legs and arms begs to differ. I grunt as one of the spears nicks my arm. I hate that I'm mostly on defense so I think quickly, wondering how in the world I was going to wave off these creatures. I dodge a jab at my head as I trail my eyes down their forms and it's like a light goes off in my head. Shadows are formed from light but they can be cast away by light too. I needed to time this attack right so I start edging to toward a table on a side wall where a very expensive vase sat. Better to break a vase than to break my bones. My plan works out well as I easily distract one of the things and I turn to face on the second when I hear a chilling scream. \"Mother!\" I barely have time to see her uncharacteristically punch the shadow thing attacking before I instinctively lift my sword and block a swipe by a spear. I saved myself a sound gashing but the unexpected swing threw me off balance and slammed against the ground on my back. My breath is taken out of me and I have a momentary moment of shock before I see a spear coming down at me. I spin and hear the tear of the petal behind me, thankful it wasn't my head being torn, and collect my dust into my hand. This takes concentration normally but I hope this brief moment is enough to do what I need. I grasp my sword and let my dust shoot out of my hand and wrap around my blade before I thrust it into the shadow man above me. I panic in the brief moment nothing happens until the creature lets out a roar of brief and disintegrates right before my eyes. I know some living creature of some type just died but yes! Ha! I win! My momentary glory is forgotten when I remember my mother. I search frantically for her and sigh when I see her being flanked by my father as he fights off one of the intruders. My relief is short lived, however, as I see a second go to pounce on my unsuspecting father from his left. Don't even ask how I managed to do what I did next because I have no idea. Between one breathe and the next I managed to swing my arm out, with my sword, and send it flying directly into the creatures' abdomen, somehow bypassing my father, and with gold dust still lighting the blade. I take a moment to stare in shock at the now empty space where my sword rested to wonder how in the hell I managed to do that. I've never taken throwing lessons in my life! I take a deep breath and turn to Mother, wanting to ask if she's all right as Father takes care of the last darkness embodiment, when two more enter in through the rip of the back wall. Beyond annoyed and infuriated, I yell at my parents to go as I pick up my sword. \"Cornelius, are you crazy?\" I hear Mother shriek. \"We can't just leave you.\" My sword parries a spear as I answer back, \"You have to take Mother and go!\" \"I will not leave my son with these infernal things to hide like a coward!\" \"It's not like you know how to protect yourself, Mother! You need –\" I grunt as the force of a spear pushes the hilt of my sword into my stomach \"—to go somewhere safer!\" \"He has a point Tabitha!\" \"And where exactly do you expect me to go—Watch out!\" I barely register her warning before I hear Father groan in pain. Between parries I glance over in his direction and see a massive hole in the flower where I assume he was thrown through. Mother stands at the hole gaping down at the scene in horror. \"Mother, when you get the chance grab Father and go! He's not as young as he used to be!\" \"But–\" \"Mother, please! I can't fight this thing if I'm worried about you too!\" With a glance, I see she's finally listening to me as she shoots up in the air apparently finding an opening. I have to turn my eyes back to my own fight but I do hear her yell \"Be careful!\" before the only ones in the near vicinity are me and the intruder. It's a scary sight to see when your opponent has no face yet still manages to send chills down your spine. I take a deep breath and concentrate more than I ever have in my life as I try to find a weakness in this being's form. It's too late though. The creature has apparently found mine. I can't help but stare in shock at where my sword lay inches from me where it landed after it got knocked out of my hand. I don't notice the butt of the spear coming toward me until it slams into my stomach and all the air leaves my lungs. My back burns as I slide across the floor. I'm barely oriented when the shadow looms over, spear raised and coming toward me. I panic. Was this how I was doing to die? Apparently not. What had to be from out of nowhere I see my sword come flying again, but this time, hitting the spear and knocking it out of the shadow's hand instead of the things body. I twitch as the butt of the spear hits my stomach again and I just know it's going to leave a bruise there for a few days. At least I'm not dead. The creature turns to whatever thwarted its deed but the thwarter gets to him first. I see what must be the dining table's cloth come over its head and cover its body. It struggles briefly before it seems to morph down into the floor back to wherever it came from. I look away from the floor and to my rescuer. \"Your Highness, the shadows have infiltrated the Vale and are surrounding the castle. You must sneak out before they kill you!\" the man above me, who I can only assume is a servant of the castle from his clothes, says. It takes me a moment to digest what he said. \"My parents!\" What happened to my parents? \"They're safe, Your Highness. There's a legion of guards protecting them just off the East wing, but you must get out now!\" he urgently prodes me to get up and I do. I follow out of the flower and we stick behind boulders and stems, keeping an eye out for the enemies as he leads me through a beaten path towards where I assume my parents are. I assumed correctly as I see the legion the man spoke about surrounding my parents in a tight circle as they held off the attackers, but I'm floored by what the man says next. \"I hope you took a long look because that's the last you'll ever see of them.\" My eyes widen as I'm pounced from behind and my face meets the ground. A weight settles on my back and I grit my teeth as I squirm. There's no give. I stop when a pair of boots stand in front of my face. \"We didn't need to keep them alive. That's just to make you cooperate.\" I spit dirt out of my mouth before asking, \"Cooperate for what?\" The man crouches down, hands twined together over his knees. He slowly grins, looking maniacal, and says, \"I guess you could say… Revenge.\" The last word is said like he could almost taste how delicious it is. Gross. \"Why would I ever cooperate in your sick schemes?\" \"Because then Mom and Dad go…\" he waves with the next word, \"bye-bye.\" I grind my teeth and glare at the man, who smiles even wider (if that's possible) knowing what my response will be. I don't bother to struggle as I'm hauled up by the shadow behind me and take one last look at my family. I even crane my neck to keep them in sight for as long as possible as I'm pulled further into the bushes where a dirt hole is. They push me down first and I land hard on my right shoulder. I grasp at it in pain and am pushed down again when the shadow lands on me. I see the man's boots land next to my head before a searing pain grows on my temple and know no more.[Chapter 3] Enlevé ~0~ My hearing comes back first, not that it helped much. It took me a while to figure out what the repetitive noise coming into my ears were. The first was the stomping of three sets of boots, which meant there was one more person than he remembered. Or two, I don't remember the shadow people having audible footsteps. The second was the sound of dragging, and now that I focus on the noise I can feel sensation returning to my legs and arms. My arms were outstretched above me and I could feel a set of hands pulling on them, which meant I was right and the two-new people aren't shadows. My legs were listless and dragging along the dirt floor. The pain comes next. I can feel where the cut on my arm has crusted over with dried blood and where my shoulder throbs. The bruise on my stomach stings from where I'm folding over it and I don't even have to look at myself to know there's a bump on the side of my head. I try not to moan in discomfort but a hiss passes through my teeth when the person pulling on my injured shoulder tugs particularly hard. \"Ah… So, the prince is awake, is he? Just set him over there, boys. There's a lot to be discussed.\" The tugging began again but I didn't open my eyes yet. I could feel one of my wings get caught under my body and I wiggled trying to move it. Tugging on a fairy's wings was equivalent to having a fistful of hair yanked. Painful and annoying. It was but a few seconds later when I was dropped onto a flat, dirt surface. It was now that I opened my eyes and the world tilted, black spots in my eyes I barely noticed with how dark the room was. If it even was a room. From where I was, the only thing I could make out was the rock ceiling above me. Everything else was still shrouded in darkness but I suspected we were still underground. Too familiar pair of boots stepped in front of my legs. \"Do you know why you're here, Your Highness?\" \"Let me guess, you love fairies so much you just had to have one on display?\" I ask cheekily. The slime ball smirks and lifts a foot. I cry out as his boot stomps on the throbbing bruise on my stomach. \"Funny. But no. You see, praised child of the Fairies, you are the means to justice.\" I cough. \"Justice for what, connard ?\" He stomps on me again and I jump up, ready to punch his face out, but the two minions grab my arms again. I lift my leg and send it into the douche's face earning me a punch to my own. Blood pools in my mouth. \"I suggest you don't try that again.\" I spit the blood on his face. He rubs it off and frowns, slapping me in the face. \"I see we're going have to be rough with you. I hope you remember how vulnerable dear old mom and dad were to us.\" \"That's only because you surprised us. We know you're coming now.\" I wish I could have kicked that smirk off his face. \"Do you? Do you really? Do you even know who I am?\" \"I don't have to know who you are to know we're going to kick your ass.\" He holds up a finger and wiggles it. \"See, with anyone else you might have a chance but with us, you don't have a chance.\" My forehead hurt from how hard I'm glaring at the man. \"And why not?\" \"You see, oh stupid one,\" he starts as his form starts to waver and grows in size. My eyes widen as I see a disturbingly familiar form take over the fairy man I've been seeing the past few hours. \"We know all your secrets.\" He was ugly. He was grotesquely ugly. And wrinkly, short, with limbs longer than his body. Oh no. Oh, god no. This was so not happening. \"Recognize me now, Highness?\" he asked mockingly. \"You're a Spriggan!\" I spat out. \"Correct.\" Spriggans were the worst of the worst. They were horrific beings that only cared about themselves. They could be as wise as old men but they had the attitude of little greedy children. Spriggans were the cause of many human troubles. Did a ship suddenly come under the wrath of fierce winds that sent it into an outcrop of rocks, sinking it? The Spriggans did that. Did otherwise healthy crops come undone and rot before harvest season started? The Spriggans probably sent a swarm of poisonous water onto them. Did a human ever find itself going in circles in a forest even though the trees kept changing? Spriggans were notorious for delighting in confusion and danger. Countless humans have fallen prey to their mischievous and other mystical creatures weren't immune either. They were hated among everyone. Especially fairies. You see, for centuries Spriggans were used as bodyguards for our kind. Back then, their true nature was only rumored, never certain. Aside from their heinous attitude, they were also known for their illusionary magic. Every action they took, where they got up close and personal with their victim, they usually had the face of the being they were targeting. They were especially prone to mimicking the face of the being's loved ones to incite feelings of betrayal in the victim so they could watch the mayhem afterward. When my great-grandfather finally got sufficient evidence of their activities, as they had been moonlighting as some of the court members and stealing money from the treasury under the member's names, he had them terminated and more than half of them executed for treason. \"So, what? This is revenge for letting you go? You should be glad there's any of your kind left at all!\" \"Glad? Glad?! We were one of the most feared creatures in existence. The most powerful. The richest creatures in the world. People cowered when they saw us coming. But then you slimy little fairies thought yourselves above us. So righteous and fair.\" His lips curl in a snarl. \"Big mistake.\" He looks up at the men holding me. \"Do it.\" I barely had time to register the whoosh of air before I got reacquainted with darkness again. ~0~ It was similar to last time. My senses came back one by one. First my hearing, then the pain, then smell. I could tell this time that no one was holding me and I wonder where the men had taken me. Unlike last time, however, an explosion of light blinded me when I opened my eyes. Hissing, I brought a hand to shade them as I tentatively open them again. I look around warily and almost jerk in surprise. I'm in a dungeon. An actual dungeon underground with bars encompassing three quarters of it. The light was coming from a lantern strung up in one corner of the cell and I was laying uncomfortably on a violet petal. I shift over on my side and groan at how stiff my muscles feel. My nose settles on my upper arm and man, do I stink! How long have I been down here? I lift my shirt and look down at my stomach and my eyes furrow at the color of the bruise. It was yellowish. I thought bruises took days to turn this color. Wait. Hold up. There is no way I could have been knocked unconscious for days at a time. No way. Anyone that strong would have killed me. And when did I get this bruise on my leg? I don't remember anyone hitting me there. Wondering what other bruises I had without my knowledge, I try to stand up. My legs wobble. I turn onto my hands and knees, breathing shallowly. I almost choke when I try to spread my wings and feel resistance. My eyes widen and I sit up. Obviously, I can't see my back even though I try to so I stretch to reach the base of my wings. I don't reach it. I can feel panic start to quicken my breathing when an obnoxious voice comes from a cell in front of mine. \"There's rope tying them together, pretty boy.\" My head jerks to that direction but I can't see anyone. \"Who said that?\" A raucous laugh answers me, grating my ears with its nasal-like quality. \"I did, pretty boy. Nice to meet yah. How do you do? How you feeling?\" I stare in the general direction, wondering if this moron was being serious. \"Seriously? You're asking me that?\" \"It's called being polite, little boy. Something you aren't being right now.\" \"I am not a little boy, sir .\" I say the last word mockingly. \"Oh yeah? Is that right? And what do they call you, little boy?\" He shoots back, emphasizing my new nickname. I cross my arms. \"I asked you first.\" \"Testy. Testy.\" Comes the voice again but this time I can hear a set of footsteps getting closer to me. The person comes into the light as they continue with, \"Beetle's my name, and razzmatazz is my game. What's yours, chum?\" My eyebrows shoot up for I was indeed looking at a blue beetle. \"Cornelius.\" \"Unfortunate name.\" The beetle says making my eyebrow twitch in annoyance. \"But it won't matter too much down here.\" He spread his arms gesturing around the place before leaning on the bars. \"So, what you in for?\" \"I'm not in for anything. I'm not a criminal.\" I say forcibly. \"Woah. Woah. You think I'm a criminal? Did you even see who brought you in? Those are the real criminals! I've never done anything bad in my life! And red head over here couldn't have either.\" I look to where he gestured to his right and vaguely see an outline of a person. I guess my eyes are getting adjusted to the darkness. Even still, I can't tell what the person looks like, only that they're laying down. \"Red head?\" \"Yeah. Look.\" He moves over to the person. \"Hey, Beautiful!\" He yells obnoxiously loud. \"Wake up, there's someone here to meet ya!\" How this person has managed to sleep the whole time this man talked I'll never know. How this person managed not to jump awake when the beetle screamed at them I'll never know either. Just his voice was giving me a headache. Must have been around a long time for them to ignore the guy. \"Toots!\" \"I'm not your toots.\" The sleepy voice surprised me, not because it was lacking annoyance – they really must have been here a long time – but because it was a girl's voice. A beautiful girl's voice. \"What's going on?\" \"We have a new cellmate, Red. Maybe you'll be more talkative with this one.\" I can't help but stare when she turns and looks in my direction. She was beautiful. Even as dirty as she was I could tell she was gorgeous. \"Hello…\" Why did that come out all breathy. \"Ha! She stun ya with her beauty, kid?\" I hear the beetle say. I glare over at him, fed up. \"Do you ever shut up?\" \"Shut up? How can I? You're the first thing to happen in God knows how long down here!\" \"How long have you two been down here?\" \"Too long! And if you haven't noticed, chum, there's no way to tell time down here.\" \"We had the Annual Bloom some days ago.\" \"It's Spring?!\" Was he always this dramatic? \"I've been down here two seasons?! My fans will think me dead!\" \"Your fans?\" I say doubtfully. \"Yeah, my fans! I'm a connoisseur of sweet nectars,\" He rubbed at the bars, \"a designer of rare threads,\" his moustache came next, \"and a judge of beautiful women,\" he leaned against the bars he shared with 'Red'. Red doesn't seem to like the compliment. \"Would you stop?\" \"You too? You wound me, sweetheart!\" Before he can continue with the dramatics, I cut him off and address the third party. \"And what's your name?\" She jumps at me addressing her and turns to me. I see her eyes fall to my downturned wings and she gasps and points. \"You're… You're one of them.\" I blink. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"A fairy!\" she gushes and stands. \"I've never seen a fairy before!\" I stand too and lean my face against the bars. \"But you're fae.\" I point out. Her enthusiasm drops a little. \"Fae? What's a fae?\" She asks confused. My eyebrows shoot up at this. \"You mean you don't know?\" \"Oh, uh…I-I don't actually know. I've been here as long as I can remember.\" \"You don't remember coming here?\" \"No.\" She looks down sheepishly. \"Oh.\" I scrunch my chin up thoughtfully. \"You never told me your name.\" \"You never told me yours.\" She responds immediately. I smirk at her cheekiness. \"I'm Cornelius.\" \"Cornelius? That's a funny name.\" She giggles before looking stricken. \"Oh, I-I mean it's perfect.\" \"Okay. Okay. Enough with the flirting!\" Wow. He was quiet longer than I thought. \"So, what's your story?\" I push away from the bars and sit on the ground, Red following my action. The beetle stays leaning on the bars. \"My kingdom was ambushed….\" \"Fairies have kingdoms?\" Red asked. \"Kingdom? Who are you in your kingdom?\" Beetle asked frantically. \"Is there a prince?\" Red asks with wonder in her voice. I smirk in amusement at her. \"Yes.\" \"He must be terribly handsome.\" The handsomest. \"Oh, he is.\" \"Strong and brave.\" I can almost see her eyes dilate thinking about him – me – thinking about me. \"None like him.\" \"I love to meet the prince.\" \"Oh, come on, Toots!\" Beetle cuts in, annoyance in his words, moustache twitching. He had been watching our little exchange. I guess my face gave it away. \"He's the prince! Look at his clothes!\" It was my clothes that gave it away? Well then. \"You're a prince?\" \"Yes.\" I say proudly. Mr. Beetle speaks up. \"Don't sound so smug, princely. You're stuck down here too.\" \"So are you.\" \"Whatever you say.\" He waved his arm around. \"So, how'd they nab a prince anyway?\" \"Well, as I was saying…\" I stare at him dryly. \"My kingdom was ambushed by these shadow-creatures. They almost looked like ghosts with spears—\" I'm interrupted again by Mr. Beetle. \"You were ambushed by Bodach's?! And you're alive?!\" He cries alarmed. Now it's my turn to be confused. \"Bodach's? What are those?\" \"Wait. You don't know what those things are? And you're a prince?\" the beetle asks slightly laughing. \"No. I do not know what those things are. Would you care to enlighten me?\" I ask him annoyed. \"What are they?!\" he starts with flair. \"They're the fiercest creatures known to man, a vision of danger, a messenger of death! And you, sir, should be dead!\" I scoff. \"Now I know you're lying.\" \"Why would I lie?\" I could see his moustache twitch. Was that moustache sentient or something? \"I'm stuck down here as much as you are! Besides, they can't come down here. They're made of shadows. No light means no shadows. They don't exist underground. What kind of weakness is that anyway? Demonic-like beings that can't be in the dark. They breathe death and they can't be in the dark…\" \"Woah. Wait. Wait a minute. What do you mean they bring death?\" \"They're like vultures! They can smell death coming before it even happens. The more deaths, the more there are!\" I clenched my teeth. \"There were no deaths.\" \"You must not have seen them, pal.\" \"No. I saw my people alive. We were attacked by these 'Bodach' and I figured out that lighting my sword with fairy dust killed them. The guards were taking them out when the bast—uh, the Spriggan – had two of the shadows ambush me.\" \"Wait. You,\" he points to me, \"killed them? Like, they're dead? Never coming back? Meeting the grim reaper dead?!\" I roll my eyes and answer him blandly. \"That's the only dead there is.\" \"But you can't kill them! That's why they're so feared! It's like killing a ghost.\" \"They exploded in front of me. Pretty sure that means they're dead.\" I tell him. \"This just keeps getting crazier—\" \"How did they get you?\" I hear the girl ask. \"It's rude to interrupt, toots—\" \"I fell for the Spriggans' trick.\" I interrupt, smiling at her and making Mr. Beetle throw his hands up. \"He used illusionary magic to make himself look like a fairy and wore clothes to look like a servant. He 'killed',\" I shoot a look at you-know-who, \"a shadow coming at me, then 'helped' me escape through a secret door. I followed, saw my parents with some guards, and got jumped. Had to leave to keep my family safe.\" \"How terrible.\" The girl sighs. \"How did he kill it?\" Beetle must be pretty bored to keep asking me questions. \"Wrapped him with a table cloth.\" \"Shadows can't exist in darkness.\" He repeats gleefully. \"Yeah, you've said that.\" I point out. \"What you haven't said, though, is why you're here.\" \"I was ambushed just like you.\" He says before acting out his woes as best as he could in a small cell. \"I was walking out of my best show yet with my cousins. The crowd loved me! We were the talk of the town. The ladies worshipped me! The guys wanted to be me! I couldn't go anywhere without being recognized! But then…. Oh, ho ho, but then—\" \"He made fun of the shadows during his show and they got upset.\" Red surprisingly, but thankfully, cuts in. \"My story!\" Mr. Beetle cries. \"I can totally see that happen.\" I snicker. Beetle humphs. \"And you?\" I ask Red. She blushes slightly and gnaws at her lower lip. \"I don't know.\" I'm skeptical. \"You don't know?\" \"I—I think I was born here?\" \"Hate to break it to you, but the shadows could definitely not make a beautiful girl like you.\" I smirk at her. I'm being completely serious even though I'm flirting with her a little. This may be surprising, but damn, this girl really is beautiful, and she hasn't started talking about stupid things yet, which is a plus in my book. My smirk widens when I see her blush deepen. \"No. I mean, I don't remember ever not being here.\" \"So, you think your parents were prisoners here, and gave birth to you?\" She nods. \"Or you came here as a baby.\" She nods again. I don't know what to say so I settle with, \"I'm sorry.\" \"Thank you, Cornelius.\" She smiles. I smile back. \"Well, as much fun as this has been,\" three guesses who this is, \"I'm hitting the hay.\" I furrow my eyebrows. There was no light down here and definitely no sense of time. \"You're tired already?\" \"Down here, bud, you go to sleep when you feel tired. Night!\" As he goes to the back of his cell and disappears into the darkness, I turn to Thumbelina. She smiles lightly at me and nods her head in goodbye. \"Good night,\" she says as she picks up her rose-petal blanket. \"Good night.\" It's only after I've laid down on the violet petal – on my side as ropes on my back were a pain – and found a comfortable spot to rest my head on my shoes – I lied, there isn't one – did I remember something very important about my hot new cell mate. She didn't tell me her name![Chapter 4] Enlev é ~0~ I never knew I would miss my duties as a Prince until I was confined to a cell underground. Days, or weeks (who knows?), passed by uneventfully. I had thought about timing the meals we received, to tell when breakfast signified a new day, but I forgot Spriggans loved to confuse their victims. Sometimes they would bring in food three times a day, sometimes twice, sometimes five times, sometimes with defined patterns, sometimes sporadically. No wonder Beetle told me to sleep whenever I wanted to. Even my bruise faded away a while ago. Days and nights passed in a whirl of darkness and mostly silence. There were times Red and I would be awake at the same time, and we'd talk to each other, but conversations usually fell short when we inevitably hit a topic she didn't know much about. It was obvious she hadn't been outside of her cell for a long time. Beetle wasn't any better at conversation either. He usually just ended up talking about himself like the conceited fool he was. My back was still tied. That sucked. I could feel my wings gradually chafing and growing raw. I can't even lay on my back anymore from the pain that flared up. I slept on my stomach most days now. I could honestly say that I had never been aware of how much I used my wings and back until I couldn't anymore. I can't lean against the wall, facing my cell mates – Companions? Neighbors? – either. I can't even lean on my sides. My captives don't bother being gentle when they let us out to clean our cells. They at least do that, though I can honestly say I've never seen a bruise on Red either. Oh, since she's been brought up again, can you believe she doesn't have a name? Yeah, apparently the unoriginal nickname Beetle gave her was the closest thing she had to a name – or at least one she could remember. She had absolutely no idea who she was. Or what she was. I'm still pretty sure she is fae but I shamelessly tuned out the tutor when he went on and on about them. Once I heard they were similar to fairies and used magic the same way, I figured they were wingless fairies and left it at that. I do distinctly remember something about them using magic without needing dust but the memory escapes me. It doesn't matter too much though. It's not like we had much opportunity to try some spells down here. Day in and day out, we just sat around, staring at each other, the ground, the bars, some speck of dust in the corner. As I said before, sometimes we talked, and sometimes we just took comfort in the silence. Sometimes all you needed was having someone in the same situation as you next to you. Sometimes, when she was particularly in a good mood she'd start humming and I swore the darkness receded a little bit at the sound of her voice. It was beautiful, as beautiful as her. She's humming again right now. It is low, soothing, and is putting me to sleep. Wanting to stay awake since I can clearly hear the Spriggans close by, I think of the past. I remember when my parents took me on this visit to a far-off kingdom. It took two weeks to get there. I remember I spent most of the time asking my parents that dreaded question. Yes, that question. Are we there yet? Yup. They were annoyed. I wasn't exactly the teen that enjoyed sitting for hours at a time looking out a window at tree leaves and dirt roads. Anyway, it took two weeks to get there. And that's not counting the hours spent on the side of the road taking naps and meal breaks. All in all, I think it took over eighteen days to get to the kingdom of Arias, where \"no fairy is without tune\". We stayed there for two lunar cycles; just enough time to be there for their Festival de la Ballade . And enough time to want to be rid of her . More on her later. It was midday when we finally got to the kingdom of endless twittering. And I meant that in the most annoyed way possible. It was like the Arian people opened their mouths just to hear their own voice. We could hear them from kilometers away and I came into the kingdom with a headache. The sun was shining that day, and it was directly in my line of sight from the moment we crested over the hill. There were spots in my eyes even after I had the curtain to the window closed for a long time after. My legs were numb and I was bored. I couldn't wait to get out of the carriage. I scowled as we came to a stop in front of what served as the royal palace in this kingdom. It was built into a rock wall, cave-like and dark if not for the candles lighting up the entryway. Vines came down over the front entrance serving as a barrier to human's nosey eyes. The King and Queen and an entourage of servants who didn't want to be there either stood in front of it, polite smiles and appropriate welcoming gestures at the ready. Greetings were pleasant enough. I won't bore you with the details though, just that there was a lot of handshakes, bowing, and curtseying among everyone. I tried not to yawn as I looked around the courtyard, already forming an escape plan in my head for later. I could see a sentry guard from my spot up in the vines, four guards stood by the front door, two more at the gates, one guard passed by us just a few minutes ago in the courtyard… \"Come along, son. Pay attention,\" my father said, cutting into my thoughts. I turned and walked up to him, and felt his arm wrap around my shoulders as he spoke with the Arian king. \"How on earth did you ever manage to carve into the rock like that?\" Father gestured at the deep groves in the wall. The Arian king grinned with pride. \"Oh, with a marvelous artist that just sprang up out of nowhere! He came frolicking into the castle one day during my people's meetings and insisted I let him carve into my home!\" \"And you just let the fool do it?\" \"Well, I insisted the man stop talking nonsense, until he showed me this delightful carving in a rock of a bird–\" Not caring much, I tried to listen in to my mother's conversation just behind me, though it wasn't particularly interesting either. \"What a pleasure to have you here, Queen Duval–\" \"Please, you may call me Tabitha, your grace.\" My mother giggled. \"Margaret, please, if you may.\" A pause. \"Tabitha, you must allow me to take you to lunch in the gardens. It is divine this time of year!\" \"It must be! I've never seen flowers this shade of blue before.\" \"Oh, darling, aren't they beautiful? We hired a new gardener and he had the strangest and most brilliant idea to–\" I tuned out their chatter, and with nothing else to do, I studied the rooms we passed. They were by far more intricately detailed and cut out than ours were, but, then again, we lived in a frilly flower and not a fortress like this. It's dark, very dark. We are quickly leaving behind the only natural light source around here and only small fires lit our way. Some walls had carvings made into the stone, others had paintings smeared across them, old battle scenes and concerts eternally recorded on them. The place seemed cold for some reason. Tapestry hung on the walls, with lines I can only assume to be for songs. Old musical instruments hung next to them too. I liked music just fine, but it was obvious these people had some obsession with music. I could tell, even with everyone else speaking low, that the rooms were made to amplify voices to the optimal effect. Which was more than annoying, especially at dinner that night. Every clink of the plates and every slam of the chalices on the table echoed off the walls, giving me a headache. As it was, I ate as quickly as reasonably possible, so I could be excused. The Arian queen's next remark stopped my plan all together. \"So, Tabitha, I hear your son is quite popular amongst the ladies of your court,\" she said. I inwardly groaned. My mother smiled with pride. \"Why yes, we recently moved his fencing lessons out into the courtyard. He has made quite the impression on the young ladies.\" \"How quaint,\" Queen Margaret replied, smiling politely, \"I'm sure they are just besides themselves at seeing such a strapping young man. Tell me, has anyone managed to gain your fancy?\" \"No, ma'am.\" I replied. \"Oh, well. I'm sure you just haven't met the right one yet. Perhaps she might even be here among our court,\" she smiled a little wider. King Dacian chortled. \"She wants you to meet her cousin's daughter, Prince Cornelius.\" I deadpanned. \"Why, dear, you didn't have to be so blunt about it,\" Queen Margaret squawked. \"What's her name, darling?\" Mother pipped in. \"Camile Leblanc. Fitting name for the girl. Her hair is as gold as the rapeseeds in the fields just beyond the gates. She's a remarkable singer and dancer. She's been the star performer of the Festival de la Ballade for the past three years, that one.\" \"She sounds like a lovely girl,\" Father said. I inwardly rolled my eyes. \"Yes, I'm quite proud of her. I haven't seen her for days, however. Perhaps I can invite her to tea in the garden with us tomorrow, Tabitha. If you don't mind.\" \"Of course not, dear.\" \"Mayhap she'll give us a clue on what song she has picked for the festival.\" Before they could go on about this girl I didn't know, I asked, \"Excuse me, what is this festival?\" \"The Festival de la Ballade is the pride and joy of the Arian Kingdom,\" answered King Dacian. \"Every year on the coolest day of the summer the entire kingdom gathers in the fields to celebrate another year of endurance, strength, and peace. The courtiers make a show of putting on a performance for our viewing pleasure.\" \"It's simply marvelous. There is music, dancing, and our royal cooks make special dishes that are just exquisite!\" \"It sounds wonderful,\" Father said. \"When is it taking place?\" Mother asked. \"In a fortnight, Madam.\" \"Perfect! We'll still be here,\" Mother replied. \"And I'm sure Cornelius would love to escort Miss Leblanc to the festival.\" Of course, my mother would find a way to set me up while we're here. She'd been trying to corral me into meeting every eligible girl the court has to offer back home as soon as I turned fourteen a few months ago. Why I didn't assume she'd do the same thing while visiting Arias I'll never know. I suspect that the sudden visit to 'our most faithful allies' had the ulterior motive of introducing me to more potential wives. I fought the urge to scoff and smiled politely. \"I'll be happy to.\" Not. Little did I know that the girl was a total psycho. I'm pretty sure I first met her the following day, right before my mother and the Arian queen set off for their tea party. Father, King Dacian, and I were off to the library to discuss trade matters (not so much me. I was obligated to listen and learn) when Mother, Queen Margaret, and her walked by on their way to the gardens. I remember thinking she was nice-looking. At that age, most girls were attractive. She was the plain sort and I could tell the Queen was exaggerating her looks, but she was easy on the eyes nonetheless. Either way, her eyes were focused only on me and I knew she liked what she saw. I gave her the grin meant only for the ladies and nodded my head in greeting before walking off with the men. I saw her again the next night at dinner. Apparently, she made a good enough impression on my mother, so Queen Margaret felt it was okay to invite an extra guest over. The conversion somehow ended on an invitation for a stroll through the gardens from my mother on my behalf for the both of us. The unexpected plans ruined my own plans to escape and I was surly. I tried to keep as calm and polite as possible since I knew Mother would be hearing about our little rendezvous soon enough and would have plenty to say about what I did wrong without my attitude being thrown into the mix. I needn't have bothered. Camile Leblanc barely said anything through the night. Basically, the only conversation we had went like this, \"I hear you're the star of the show in the festival.\" \"Yes. I've been the lead singer the past three years, sire.\" \"How nice. What do you sing about?\" \"Peace and nature, sire.\" \"Every year?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ever think about singing about something else?\" \"Never.\" \"Why not?\" \"Why sing about anything else?\" \"What about traveling and seeing the countryside?\" \"Why would I want to do that?\" \"To see something different. Experience adventure.\" \"But I'm quite content here. I don't need to see anything else, my lord.\" Well then. It was terribly boring, and we didn't have any other topic to talk about. I could even tell our chaperone for the evening was bored out of her mind too. She didn't leave much of an impression, but seemingly, I left a good one because I kept seeing her everywhere after that. Everywhere. It didn't help that my mother and Queen Margaret encouraged her in approaching me. I had thought it was perfectly normal to see her at my tennis tournament the following day. She was hardly the only girl to come out and watch the visiting prince get hot and sweaty, and frankly I hadn't cared much that she, specifically, had come. What full-blooded male didn't like having the attention of ogling girls only on them? She had planted herself right in my line of sight, and thinking back a little harder, only really kept her eyes on me without even flicking her eyes to the play of the ball. Afterward, she – not the servant – handed me a towel and practically followed me to my room as her maid brought up the rear. Again, our conversation was slightly stilted, though she did talk a little more this time about the recent match and quite obviously showing her lack of knowledge on the subject. I saw her twice more that day, again with my mother and the Arian queen whilst they walked to tea and then again at suppertime. That evening my father and the Arian king seemed more inclined to get us two to talk to each other, much to my annoyance. Luckily, Miss Leblanc had a curfew that evening so I wiped my hands from having to entertain her with a walk after. The following day I was scheduled to take a ride out into the fields with some guards and the men. Unlike my kingdom, Arias had the habit of employing dragonflies – not butterflies – as their preferred method of transportation, to my relief. Butterflies are not manly or majestic creatures no matter how much Mother insists they are. They were only a formality, anyway, since almost immediately upon getting there the guards took up purchase along the outer rim of the field so that us royals could fly freely among ourselves. Being fourteen, I immediately urged my father into a race, which he reluctantly agreed to when King Dacian showed interest. Some guards followed along a little to the side as we took off. I lost. Whatever. Anyway, we got back to the castle only to find Miss Leblanc, her mother, my mother, and Queen Margaret enjoying luncheon together. Obviously, we were paired off for another walk after they were done. She had a melancholy look on her face as we walked outside, though she tried to hide it. \"What's on your mind, Miss Leblanc?\" \"Oh, nothing important, my lord,\" she mumbled, making an extra effort to clear her facial expression. \"Alright then,\" I said. Ten seconds passed before she spoke again. \"I will not be able to visit as frequently as I've been doing, sire.\" I silently cheered. \"How unfortunate, Miss.\" I could finally execute my escape plans tomorrow night. And it worked. The following night, anyway. I don't remember why I couldn't follow through the first time. Once I got out of the royal grounds, I flew away to a tall tree I saw on the journey there, right outside the Arian border. I flew to the tallest branch I could find and sat on a thicket of leaves overlooking the east. I could just barely see the shine of some human lanterns off in the horizon. Normally I would be riding my bumblebee at the time to the human settlement, but not wanting anyone seeing me take a dragonfly from the stables, I had to settle for simply gazing at it. I managed to get back in the castle without anyone knowing the wiser, which meant I was completely shocked when my mother confronted me in my chambers the next morning about what in the heavens I had been thinking leaving the palace without any royal guards to protect me. To say I was speechless was an understatement. I don't think I even breathed, I was so surprised. I had never been caught before in the two years I had been sneaking out of my own home. She ranted at me about how being royal, I was far more in danger of being accosted, killed, or kidnapped than anyone else in the kingdom; how I should just let the royal guards do their duty to the crown by keeping at least two with me wherever I go and always letting someone at the palace know where I was going; how I was an irresponsible child for letting my mother worry about my safety and whereabouts. Even as I argued with her back and forth for the next several hours, I never thought about how she could have possibly known I was out last night, specifically where I was last night, at all. I wasn't allowed out of my room for that whole day and my mother even requested that two guards be stationed outside my door and assigned on guarding duties the rest of our stay in Arias. I was allowed out when Camile came calling. I was still silently reeling when she let slip some vital information. I looked at her quickly. \"What was that?\" She glanced at me and licked her lips. \"I said, my lord, that I was quite worried when I saw you leaving the kingdom by your lonesome…\" I stopped walking. \"You were the one who told my parents?\" I said, with hidden fury. Her eyebrows crinkled. \"Was I not supposed to? You could have been in danger, sire.\" \"I was not in any danger. I would appreciate it if you kept your findings private, Miss Leblanc.\" I gave her a dark glance and started walking again. She wriggled her hands a little. \"I apologize, Prince Cornelius. I was merely worried for your safety. I did not mean to cause trouble.\" Though still upset, I nodded. \"Apology accepted. How did you even see me leave?\" \"I was taking a stroll along the outer edge of my property, sire. It was by chance I saw you heading outside the gate. I came by the palace this morning to make sure you were all right.\" Given that she had told me she would be busy and unable to visit as often, I found this odd but didn't say anything. I also forgot to ask how she knew I was up in a tree that night. I believe I only really started to notice how strange the girl was a few days later. When my parents finally let me start walking around the palace by myself again, and I started having conversations with passing nobles, I noticed Camile would fleetingly mention details about my life or my kingdom that I only told those nobles I spoke with. I assumed it was just coincidence and that maybe she'd been given details by my mother's quite obvious attempt at getting us interested in each other. That is, until, I noticed that she knew only the details I specifically brought up in conversations – conversations that she was not a part of. I also started to notice that she began wearing a lot more brown, gold, and red clothing much like my family wears. She seemed to not notice that the colors did not flatter her at all. To say I started looking over my shoulder a lot more was an understatement. Most of my plans changed from escaping from the palace to escaping from her . Even then she still managed to find out where I was or where I was going. She had to have known she was accidently revealing the fact that she was following me. Or maybe she had servants watching me. I started to pay more attention to what faces kept popping up around me in the hallways. This went on until the day of the festival arrived. Up first in the festival was the racing tournament between the guards atop the dragonflies, followed by a fencing tournament. The race, I was told, was inspired by the medieval jousting tournaments, which the eleventh Arian king took interest in. Unfortunately, the royal family could invite guests up on the podium with us, which meant Camile was invited to sit next to Queen Margaret. Fortunately for me, protocol called for Camile's seat to be on the right – and a step down – of Queen Margaret, to the Queen's left her husband, my father on his other side, my mother next to my father, and then I. The day was fun. The real nightmare started later that night. I was forced to escort Camile to the ball per my mother's order, but there was no way I was going to spend all night with her. So, whenever I got the chance to leave her I took it. Whether it was to dance with some other random girl or talk to some noble man that wanted to give me a few tips on whatever I didn't care. I even uncharacteristically approached some of the elder guests and introduced myself, making my parents proud and making me cringe. All the while I could feel Camile's eyes on my back and every time I glanced back at her she would be looking and grinning at me. I know I'm supposed to act like the man I was, but back then the situation was just creepy and weird, so I just decided to ignore her until she hopefully noticed I wasn't interested. Eventually, some of her friends started asking me to dance. I accepted not knowing they knew her, but I soon knew differently. Almost immediately they'd bring up Camile in one way or another, possibly to see if I was thinking of courting her and surely, to tell her after whatever it was I said. Thankfully, when a noble girl is given the chance to dance with a prince, any friendships are thrown out the window in the face of a courting opportunity, so the girls quickly turned the conversation into their favor. Normally, at that age I'd tune out any conversation the girl made that pertained only to herself, but this time I pretended to care just to have a little more time away from Camile. I couldn't really avoid her when she herself asked me to dance or when dinner was called, and she sat fairly close to me. Nor when at the end of the night, my parents and the Arian king and queen not so subtly enticed us to a moonlight walk – with a chaperone, of course. The walk just cemented the fact that I would never court this creepy girl at all and I couldn't be happier that we were leaving in three days. We sat down at a bench with our chaperone a respectable distance on another. We stayed silent for a few minutes until she broke the silence. \"Is your kingdom as beautiful as I've heard?\" I nodded my head once. \"I'd like to think so.\" \"I think it would be just marvelous to visit in the springtime. Your mother has told me the flowers in the valley are unlike any we have around here.\" I pulled my hand away before she could lay hers on top of mine. \"It's called the Vale, actually. Besides, I remember you saying you didn't like to travel.\" She gave a high-pitched giggle. \"I did say that, didn't I? Nice to know some boys do listen to a girl.\" She laid her hand on my arm instead. I tensed. \"Well? What changed your mind?\" \"Why, how else will I get to see you, my lord?\" I frowned. \"See me?\" She nodded her head and smiled. \"Yes. It'd be terribly lonely only speaking to each other through letters. We'd have to send portraits to each other lest we forget what the other looks like. Visiting each other would solve that little conundrum quite nicely.\" Her smile widened, and she squeezed my arm. I looked at her steadily and slowly asked, \"Miss Leblanc, what are you talking about?\" \"Well, I know that as a prince it would be much more difficult for you to visit me with you so busy with royal duties. It'd be much easier for me to visit you in your kingdom. And, please, my lord, you may call me Camile.\" \"Miss Leblanc,\" I said anyway, \"are you suggesting that you and I are to court each other?\" \"Of course, silly. Isn't that why we've been seeing each other the past few weeks?\" If seeing each other meant that the female party pursued the male party as he frantically found ways to keep busy without her. \"Miss Leblanc, I think there's been some misunderstanding. I do not have the intention of pursuing a relationship with you.\" She froze, smile still in place, but with a confused look on her face. \"Excuse me?\" I looked at her head on. \"I do not wish to pursue a relationship.\" Her smile vanished. \"Why ever not?\" \"I do not wish to pursue a relationship,\" I repeat, a little slower. She looked like she teared up. \"It's me, isn't it? What's wrong? What did I do?\" \"Do?\" I ask confused. \"You didn't do anything.\" \"Than why don't you want me?\" she whines. I sighed internally. \"Miss Leblanc–\" She held up her hand. \"Stop! I don't want to hear it.\" She turned around on the bench. \"Please just go,\" she whispered. I paused, glanced at the chaperone, and stood to go. \"Alright.\" I started walking. \"Wait!\" I looked at Camile. She stood up and got close, and I could see we grabbed the attention of the chaperone. \"Don't go yet. Was it the walks? Did I tarry too long? I apologize, I just wanted to spend as much time as possible with you before you went.\" I stepped back. \"I apologize for the misunderstanding, Miss Leblanc, but I do not feel that way for you.\" She shook her head. \"No, you don't mean that.\" She stepped close again and leaned up. I held her arms away and turned my head, feeling her lips land on my cheek. I sighed in relief as I heard the chaperone shout, \"Miss Leblanc! Young lady, behave yourself.\" I thought I had handled the situation well enough, and the chaperone could attest to the fact that I was not the one making advances. Nonetheless, my mother had a few – not really – choice words about it. Apparently, Camile went crying to her mother about me, who then went to the Arian queen, who then spoke to my mother. Once it became apparent to my parents that I wanted no future with the poor, fragile Leblanc, they excused my behavior as being a young boy still too interested in sword play and studies and we left without further talk of courting or betrothals. It wasn't the last I saw or heard of Camile Leblanc, but at least I didn't have to deal with her creepy behavior. Looking at Red now from my cell, I couldn't help but compare the two girls. Both seemed to like talking, though Red seemed to talk more around the beetle, perhaps from knowing him longer. Both seem to have an eye on my kingdom, but Red had a more genuine curiosity. Both definitely liked singing, yet Red seemed to hum more than sing and usually kept singing to a very low volume. Both girls were easy on the eyes, but Red was by far more gorgeous than Camile was. If there was anyone I had to be stuck with in this forsaken dungeon, it would definitely be with Red. ","Summary":" Enlev é ~0~ Being a prince sucked. It really did.

On this hot day in late May, we see ournteam, once divided by an old pro's prejudice, standing united. Tonsee how the players functioned together, the coach split them intontwo groups for a scrimmage. Team one was on defense, with Spike as anfree-safety. Team two on the offense had Junior as quarterback, andnBecky \"the Ice Box\" as a receiver. At the sound of the whistle,nthe ball was snapped. Becky shot off glancing behind her for the ball she knew was coming. nWithout fail, Junior, her stepbrother and friend, sent it sailing tonher in a perfect spiral. She had it in her hand less than twonseconds before she was down. She wasn't hurt, but it never feltnthat great to get tackled anymore. For some reason, Nike hadn'tnseen a reason to make shoulder pads for the body type that came withnboobs. As she landed, the scent of grass, sweat, and another smell shendidn't recognize drowned her senses. It had a spice to it, similarnto whatever stuff Junior wore, but it was different in a very goodnway.

You were making a face like you were in pain. nI've never seen you make that face before just from gettingntackled.\" Those eyes were still studying her, always moving butnlingering as if drawn to hers. That smell was starting to intoxicate her. When she didn't move ornsay anything else, he knelt beside her and started to take her helmetnoff of her. Her only thought was, 'Is he going to kiss me!' nShocking as that would be, she wasn't totally against the idea. \"Spike! What the hell are you two doin' over there!\" thencoach shouted. \"She's acting weird, coach! I think she might be concussed ornsomethin'!\" Shaking his head, the coach started over to the two. Looking down atnher confused face, flushed appearance, and flustered demeanor, hentold Spike to take her to trainer's office. 'I knew it. Girlsnshouldn't be playing football at this age.' Jerking her arm out of Spike's reach she bristled. \"No. I'mnfine. I'll go check in with the trainer myself,\" and stormednoff. Climbing the stairs out of the stadium, her thoughts were in a whirl.n'Is this what it's always going to be like? Every time I getntackled? Maybe there's a reason why girls don't play football.'n Her face was on fire, her stomach full of butterflies and bees, andnher heart wan on overdrive. Entering the weight room, heading for the back offices, she noticed ansign-up sheet on the wall. \"GIRL'S SOCCER TRY-OUTS JUNE 1st!\" 'Soccer? It's not quite football but… well...' Before shencould talk herself out of it, she signed the sheet. She was donenwith football. She couldn't risk that happening in a game; itnwouldn't be fair to the team. It wouldn't be right for the team.n Though she doubted she would react like that if Zoltech tackled her,nshe couldn't let that happen again. Whether it was the right decision or just hormones, she couldn't bensure. 'Maybe this is growing up.' Looking at her name writtennin bold black marker, she hoped she was doing the right thing andnstarted off for the back offices again. She still couldn't getnthose eyes out of her mind. Later that evening, Becky was lying on her bed staring at hernceiling, enjoying the breeze wafting through her open window. Shencouldn't get him off her mind. Walking home, taking a shower,neating a snack; no matter what she was doing, thoughts of him gnawednat her brain. She couldn't understand it. She knew that thing she had for Junior in the sixth grade was a crushnthat had nowhere to go. They were meant to be friends. Not mentionnsince their parents got married, that would be a little weird. Shenwas happy with the way things had turned out. When the Giants beat the Cowboys, there was a mutual respect when thenteams united. They got along well, but the friendships were slow. nIt was in the seventh grade when Junior, Becky, and Spike trulynbonded. That was when everything went badly for Spike. In the middle of October that year, Spike's dad got caught. nSpike's mom, Debbie, found a bottle of steroids in his dad's worknbench drawer. She had thought he was taking them and confronted him.n He said he wasn't and didn't know how they got there. He evenntook an at-home drug test to prove himself. A couple weeks later, she found him mixing something into Spike'snfood. Her suspicion was too strong to be ignored. She bought ansecond test and had Spike take it. It came back positive. Hisnfather had been giving him measured doses of steroids to \"increasenhis athletic performance\" since he was ten. It all made sense tonher now. Spike's raging fits, his aggression; even those points innthe off-season when he was felt what could only be described a puny. Debbie had her husband arrested, divorced him, and took him for allnhe was worth. The only reason she and Spike stayed were his friendsnwere here. But, when everybody found out what happened, his friendsnshied away from him. No one would sit with him at lunch. No one,nthat is, but Junior and Becky. At first, he took it for pity, which it was. But soon, they grew tonunderstand each other better. Spike stopped referring to himself innthird person. Becky dropped the attitude. Junior was... well, henwas Junior. Spike kept playing football, after a bit of persuasionnby his new friends. Friends were all they had ever been. So what was going on now? 'AmnI falling for Spike?' Thoughts of his eyes and that smile keptncoming. 'A smile that looks so much better now that he's takennthat stupid cap off his front tooth,' she thought with a snort. nAbout that time, the front door opened and shut, followed by thenpounding of feet on the stairs. A/N:n Okay. It's my first fanfiction EVER. Is it good? Bad? Let menknow. The rating might go up later for content or something but fornnow, we'll start out slow.[Chapter 2] The thundering feet pounded all the way to her closed door. \"Becky? You in there?\" Junior was bellowing through the door like it was ten inches thick and made of steel. With a roll of her eyes and a sigh, she opened the door. What greeted her eyes was not what she expected to find. Junior was indeed there, but so was Spike. Both were sweaty, smeared with dirt and grass, and still in full gear. They had apparently run there straight from practice. Remembering her still wet hair, blue plaid pajama pants, and frumpy white t-shirt, which actually belonged to Junior, her face began to burn. \"H-hi!\" she greeted, her voice devastatingly squeaky. She started wishing the floor would turn carnivorous and swallow her whole. Both boys only looked at her like she'd lost her mind. Junior reached out a hand and felt her forehead. \"Well… you are a bit on the warm side. Should I call your dad?\" Spikes gave her that same studying look he gave her at practice. \"We went to the trainer when you didn't come back to practice. He said you were fine but he didn't know where you were.\" \"I am fine. Really, I was just sleeping. I'm gonna go, uh…dry my hair! So, I'll see you guys in a bit, k?\" Without waiting for a response, she shut the door and collapsed on her bed. Deciding honesty was the best policy, not to mention they may still be standing in the hallway, she picked up the hair dryer her cousin gave to her this past Christmas. Ten minutes later, she stood staring at herself in the mirror. Her hair dry and acceptable now, she felt compelled to do more. While she didn't smear mud all over her face and call it make-up, she did have some lip gloss and mascara. Anything else was too much for her. Besides, it took her a month to stop stabbing herself in the eye with the mascara brush, and she didn't have the motivation for further experimentation. After putting on a pair of jean shorts and a black tank top, she took a deep breath, opened her door, and walked down to the living room. Junior was there, showered, dressed, and eating a pudding cup in front of the TV. \"So, how long have you had a thing for Spike?\" Just like that, Becky froze like a deer in headlights on her way to the kitchen. \"W-what? Where did that come from? I don't know what you're talking about. I think you've gotten too much sun.\" \"Huh… Well, mom and Danny are gonna be home late. They've gone over to Merryton for a night out on the town; dinner and a movie or whatever. I thought we could go down to the diner and get something to eat.\" \"Good, maybe something other than pudding will make your brain work again.\" She was hoping her sarcasm would cover up her nerves. At least she wasn't blushing. \"I asked Spike if he wanted to come and he said he'd be here at 7:30.\" With that bit of information added, the dreaded blush returned. Her eyes darted to the clock on the VCR, it was 7:25. \"Yeah, that's what I thought, liar.\" \"How did you find out? I haven't told anybody.\" \"Becky, how many girlfriends have I had in the past two years?\" \"Too many to count.\" \"That's exactly why I know. They looked at me the way you look at Spike. Well, actually, you look a bit more like a panicked rabbit than they did; but it's generally the same look.\" \"Are you gonna tell him?\" she said with the wariest of looks on her face. \"No, that's your job. I might help it along, though.\" \"I can't tell him! He'll think I've lost my mind!\" \"So you're cute and stupid when you truly like somebody. I've always known you were blind to it. Maybe now you'll sit up and take notice.\" \"What am I blind to? Take notice of what? What the hell are you talking about?\" Unfortunately, Becky didn't get her answers. As she got these words out, the doorbell rang. Becky's cheeks turned impossibly redder as her chocolate eyes darted between Junior and the door holding out the apparent object of her affection. Juniors only reaction was to sit back and grin. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Let him in.\" Trying to swallow the knot in her throat, Becky opened the door with trembling hands. There stood Spike, hair perfectly gelled, wearing a fitted gray t-shirt, khaki shorts, and a grin. \"Hey.\" \"H-hey!\" \"So… are you all ready to go?\" At that she looked at Junior, who was trying to hide the fact that he was laughing and failing miserably. \"Yeah, I think we're ready. Are you ready, Ice Box ?\" The only answer he got for his cheek was a withering glare before Becky stomped out the door. This earned a questioning look from Spike to Junior who only shrugged. The seemingly endless twenty minute walk from their house to the local diner consisted of Becky walking twenty feet ahead of the boys. The whole way Becky's back and neck felt like they were on fire. Though she could hear them chatting amiably, Spike gently prodding Junior for the reason behind the Ice Box's frosty demeanor, she couldn't help but feel she was being visually judged from behind. At first she tried to add a gentle sway to her hips like the models on TV, but she was afraid it looked like she was waddling so that stopped quickly. She all but ran through the diner door and sat down in a booth. The time it took the boys to catch up gave her a blessed forty-five second break to calm the nerves crawling up and down her spine. Just as her breathing returned to normal, the bell at the door tinkled and the boys approached her chosen table. Junior slid into the seat across from her, leaving only enough room to clarify to Spike that he could sit there if he wanted, but Junior would prefer to sit on that side alone. In her haste to get away from her imagined judgment, Becky had thrown herself all the way across the booth's bench seat. As anyone would, Spike saw this as an easy invitation and slid in next to her. Oh my god oh my god oh my god… was the only clear thought left in her brain. All other thought was left behind as his scent overwhelmed her. This time there wasn't a hint of sweat or grass, only that base of spices she couldn't name and soap. Becky was so lost in it, she felt like she was drowning and never wanted to come up for air. That is, until her eyes landed on Junior's smirk. At this she came back to the present, her eyes shooting to Spike to see if he'd noticed her dazed moment. If he had, he gave no indication.The oblivious object of her affection was studying the menu they all knew by heart like he'd never been to the diner before. The waitress came to the table, scanning their faces with an unimpressed air, and took their order. As usual, they got the usual: burgers, fries, and chocolate shakes all around. They sat in silence, no one willing to start the conversation but not against having one. Then, all hell broke loose for Becky. She could have exploded there on the spot. \"Hey, Spike,\" started Junior. \"Are you going to the party tomorrow?\" \"What? The one Hot Hands is having? Yeah, I guess. Why?\" \"Well, I was just wondering if you were taking a date.\" Becky's eyes shot to Junior's face, and if it were possible, she would have melted a hole right through the middle of it. Then her eyes ran to Spike's face, positively pleading for a negative response, while trying to maintain a neutral expression. \"I dunno. I wasn't planning on it. Are we supposed to? Maggie Simon's been trying to get me to go with her for the past week. I just haven't given her an answer yet.\" \"Maggie Simon! You can't go with her!\" It shot out of her mouth before she could stop it. After she said it, she hated herself. With an outburst like that, he was sure to ask… \"Why? What's wrong with her?\" Shit. \"Uh… Well, didn't Tommy just break up with her? He told me she was way too controlling and clingy. She's totally on the rebound looking for a new pet to push around.\" Whew, close save. \"Good point. No, then, I'm not taking a date.\" \"Hot Hands told me this morning everybody should try to get one. What about you Beck? Do you have a date?\" Shit! What kind of game is he playing? \"Uh, no, I guess I don't.\" Becky felt the evil blush creep across her face and spread down her neck as she answered. She didn't know if she was embarrassed because she didn't have one or because she could guess where this was going. \"Everyone I know that's going has a date. Zoltech's going with Becky Webster, Tad with Tonya Wages, and Billy with Hazel Sharp; the whole team has dates. I'd hate for you guys to show up and be the only ones flying solo.\" By now, Becky didn't know if she should pass out and hope to never wake up or vault the table to kill Junior first. \"I don't even know that I'm going.\" \"What do you mean?\" Spike was looking at her seriously now. \"Why wouldn't you go?\" \"It's for the football team, right?\" It just hit her that Becky hadn't told the boys about her decision yet. \"Well, I'm not on the football team.\" \"What! What are you talking about? Coach told Danny and your Uncle Kevin he was taking all of the Giants for the freshman team! Did he say something to you?\" Junior was obviously not taking this as easily as she hoped he would. \"No, it's not the coach. I decided today that I'm going to play soccer instead.\" At this, she stopped Junior with a hand as he was about to explode. \"I have my reasons for not playing, and as much as I love football, it's time I accept the fact that I am a girl. I will not be playing on the freshman or any other team. I'll still come to the games and cheer, throw the ball around with you guys, watch games on TV, and play in some games in the park just for fun. I'm still me and I'm not going anywhere.\" Junior was sitting, dumbstruck into silence, staring at her like she was an alien creature. \"Are you sure this is what you want to do?\" Spike had finally spoken up. \"Yeah, I am. Soccer is kind of like football and basketball mixed with feet instead of hands. It'll take getting used to and practice, but it'll still be fun.\" \"What about tomorrow night? Are you just going to sit at home by yourself? I mean, just because you're not on the football team anymore doesn't mean you can't go. Hot Hands won't care. This way you can break it to the whole team.\" \"I don't want to risk the embarrassment. You know Hot Hands' head fits the nickname too. He might freak out and make me leave.\" \"Not if you're my date.\" Spike's eyes were glued to the table top in front of him like it was the most interesting thing he'd ever seen. His ears were tipped in red and he showed no signs of looking at anyone. \"And if you want, me and Junior can go ahead and tell them tomorrow at practice so they'll have time to get over it before the party. That way, you won't have to worry about it.\" Becky's heart was in her throat and she was mystified by the half of Spike's face she could see. \"Okay.\" \"Which part?\" Junior asked. \"Both. I'll go as Spike's date and I'd appreciate it if you guys gave the team the heads up.\" Her eyes never left Spike's face which was still stuck facing the tabletop. \"Oh, crap.\" Both looked at Junior. \"To think, I was dreading the drills tomorrow.\" The tension was broken, the food arrived and plans were made. Spike would come over at 6:30 and the three of them would walk over to Oak Street to pick up Nina Blackburn, Junior's date and girlfriend of one week. After that, there was no way of knowing what would happen until practice the next day. They decided if the team took it too hard, all four would skip the party and see a movie. \"What if Nina doesn't want to see a movie and gets mad that we're not going?\" Becky asked. \"Don't worry; she's been dying to see the Devil Prods, or something like that. It can't be that bad. It sounds like a stupid horror movie. The worst case is we'll get a good laugh out of it.\" They all finished eating, paid, and walked the three blocks back to the O'Shea house. They stopped when they got to the driveway. \"So, I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" \"Don't forget we have practice at 9:00. Don't be late or it's five extra laps for the whole team.\" \"What are you going to do tomorrow while we're at practice, Beck?\" Spike looked a bit concerned. \"Soccer tryouts are tomorrow at 9:30. That'll keep me occupied enough.\" Goodbyes were said, and the step siblings headed for the house. No sooner had the door clicked behind them and Becky punched Junior in the arm. Grabbing the victimized arm, Junior roared, \"What the hell was that for!\" \"What the hell did you have to call me out like for in front of Spike?\" Becky yelled back. \"It worked didn't it!\" \"Lucky for you it did!\" With that said, she half-deflated with nothing else to be angry about. \"So, thanks, I guess,\" she said curtly. \"You're welcome,\" he grumbled, still eyeing her, nervous she would swing again. The step siblings bid their goodnights and entered their respective bedroom doors. Junior went congratulating himself on a nicely-executed scheme. While Becky went with both elation and trepidation over tomorrow, she was also left battling through the conflict over whether or not she should hate Junior or be forever grateful. Would everything go okay tomorrow? She finally settled that her future treatment of Junior would all depend on how the party ended the next night. It seemed fair enough for her, and let her mind rest just enough so that she could spend the rest of the night falling into the sweetest dreams of her \"date\" the next day and hellish nightmares over the possible backfire that still loomed in the plan.

","Summary":" It'snthe summer before 9th grade and the \"little\" Giantsnaren't so little anymore. On this hot da"},{"Movie":"Thumbelina","Title":"Penelope and Tom Thumb","Author":"A Belle-ish Snow White","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11154570","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 1: The Little Princess Every fairy in the Vale was happy when Cornelius married Thumbelina. They were overjoyed when they heard that Thumbelina had given birth to a beautiful baby girl, who the royal couple named Penelope. Penelope had dark red hair, like her father, and bright blue eyes, like her mother. The young princess had light pink wings, like her grandmother Tabitha. Penny, as her family called her, was a very happy child, and never asked for much. She never let being a princess make her spoiled. When Penny was a teenager, about 16, she came to her parents and asked for one seemingly simple thing. \"I want someone to love me.\" King Cornelius looked at his daughter, puzzled. \"What do you mean? Your mother and I love you very much.\" \"Your grandparents love you, too, Penny.\" Thumbelina added. Princess Penelope looked down at her green dress and sighed. \"I mean, I want to find someone to love me, the way you two love each other...\" \"Oh...\" Thumbelina looked over at her husband, seeing him rub his chin in thought. She looked back at her daughter and saw that the look on her face was similar to the one she had a long time ago. Back when she was looking in a storybook page with her mother. Cornelius stood from his seat and said, \"Penny, we will help you find love. Starting tomorrow.\" Penelope looked up with a look of joy in her eyes. \"Really? Oh, thank you, thank you so much!\" She gave her parents a big hug and flew to her room. Penny sat down on a chair in front of her vanity and sighed happily. She had been dreaming of finding love for a long time. She remembered her parents telling her the stroy of how they'd met, and what they had to go through before they got married. Ever since then, Penelope had been wishing for someone to love her that strongly. She looked out the window and sighed again, sadly this time. The young red-headed royal suddenly realized that she had never been outside of the Vale before. \"What if I can't find someone special for me?\" She asked herself aloud. Penny turned back to the mirror and ran a comb through her long hair, which reached just past her thighs. \"I would make a good wife. I would!\" She looked at herself and scoffed. \"Look at you, talking to yourself like you're on sale!\" Penelope stood up and went over to her bed. Before she could lay down, she heard clattering from downstairs. \"What was that?\" she quietly went over to her bedroom door and gently laid her ear against it. Hushed voices sounded from the other side. \"Find the girl! Now!\" a male's voice whispered harshly. Penny gasped softly, quickly covering her mouth. She looked around her room for a way to escape. The window in her room didn't open, for safety reasons, and breaking it would make too much noise. 'I'll have to chance it.' Penelope ran over to the window. Just as she had raised a lamp to break it, her door was broken into multiple pieces. She ducked in fear and turned to see a large frog in a tux standing where her bedroom door once was. \"Grab her.\" The frog demanded of his companions. Two more frogs, both a sickly pale green, jumped out and grabbed Penny's arms. She screamed, hoping someone would hear her. The frogs slapped their hands over her mouth as they drug her out of her room and hopped out of the castle. The next morning, Thumbelina and Cornelius cried in front of Penny's room, having found the place in shambles. There was no sign of their beloved daughter.[Chapter 2] Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 2: Toads... Penelope groaned as she sat up. She rubbed her eyes and yawned. Sometime after being kidnapped, she'd passed out. The young redhead looked around, worried. She had no idea who had kidnapped her, or even what they wanted her for. The fairy princess was sitting on a little bed that was made out of a chestnut shell. The bed was on the stage of what looked to be a boat. \"Where am I?\" she whispered to herself in slight panic. Suddenly, Penelope heard footsteps coming in her direction. She watched as the frog in the tuxedo walked out with 2 toads following him. One was dressed as a clown while the smaller toad with him was dressed as a viking. \"Hello, princess.\" The bigger toad said. He put his hand to his chest. \"I am Grundel. Your mother was supposed to marry me.\" Penelope sneered as she stood up. \"You liar! My parents told me about you, you nasty toad! You tried to force my mother to marry you! Then, you tried to kill my father!\" She was boiling over with anger. How dare he claim to be her mother's intended groom when he had tried to force marriage upon her! Then, she remembered something about her parent's stories. \"Wait. How did you survive? My dad said that you fell off the side of the walkway and you pulled him down with you. Dad was able to fly away, but... what happened to you?\" Grundel's smirk fell. He huffed out a breath before continuing, ignoring her question. \"I have brought you here to have you marry my son, Bumper.\" He pointed to the smaller toad with him. Bumper smiled goofily at the fairy princess and waved. \"H-hello, princess.\" he stammered before covering his face with his viking helmet and giggling like a love-struck fool. Penelope frowned at his behavior. She turned back to Grundel. \"Excuse me, sir, but I really need to get home. I have no intention of marrying your son.\" She stepped off of the bed and dusted off her green dress. Grundel sneered deeply. \"I did not give you a choice. You marry my son today.\" \"No, I won't.\" Penelope said defiantly before pushing past Grundel and Bumper. She was about to fly away, but the frog in the tuxedo grabbed her arm. \"You're not leaving that easily.\" He said angrily. He whistled loudly, calling out his two helpers. They hopped over and tied Penelope's wings together with vines and thread. She struggled to free them, but they were tied tight. Then, the helper frogs tied Penelope's arms to her sides so she couldn't escape. \"Hey!\" Grundel laughed triumphantly. \"Now, you will marry my son.\" \"Why would I marry your son? What do you gain from that?\" The redheaded princess asked, glaring at Grundel and trying to break out of the threads and vines. \"Since your mother won't marry me, I'll doom her only daughter to the fate she'd prevented for herself. It's the perfect revenge.\" Grundel smiled evilly. Then, he snapped at his frog helpers. \"Take her around back. My wife will help get her dressed for the wedding.\" Penelope struggled against the hold of the helpers again as they started walking away with her. \"There won't be a wedding because I'm not marrying your son! Let me go! Help!\" She screamed as they carried her away. In a back room of the boat, a blonde female toad was humming 'Here Comes the Bride' in a high pitch. She looked in a little mirror as she applied a large amount of lipstick onto her lips. After making a popping noise with her mouth, she chuckled in satisfaction at her appearance. While she was fluffing up her short, slightly curly hair, Grundel's helpers carried Penelope over to her. \"Freda, here is the bride-to-be. Mr. Grundel said for you to get her ready for the wedding.\" Freda squealed joyfully. She turned around and smiled at Penelope. \"Of course! I have the perfect look for her.\" She pointed to a chair near the corner of the room. \"Just set her down there. The helpers put Penelope in the chair and left. The redhead huffed as she looked around for something to cut her bindings with. She looked at the blonde toad in the room with her. \"Ma'am, please! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm not marrying your son today or ever.\" Freda laughed. \"Oh, nonsense. You're marrying my son today. Now, I was thinking sleeves.\" She prattled on to Penny about her wedding dress as the fairy princess rested her arms on her knees. She looked down at the ground and sniffled, beginning to cry. Would she ever see her home again, her parents? Penelope put her tied wrists up to her eyes and cried. This made Freda stop working on the dress and look at the young lady. \"Poor thing... Marriage can be so stressful.\" She shook her head in pity as she made some final stitches on the dress. She was a very fast worker. \"Here we go. Isn't it gorgeous?\" The dress had mid-length sleeves and reached the ground. It was white with sliver colored accents on the sleeves and waistline. Freda quickly put Penelope in the dress and clapped happily at her work. \"Perfect! Absolutely perfect.\" Penny sighed, shaking her head. She looked up, her blue eyes filled with anger. \"You're not listening! I am not marrying your son! I don't even know anything about him, except that his name is Bumper.\" Freda waved her comment off. \"Oh, you can learn more about each other on your honeymoon.\" Penny made a confused face before sighing loudly. 'Toads...' Thank you to all those who posted a review on this story. I have taken your words into consideration. Also, it was shown in the end credits that Grundel supposedly found a lady frog to marry. So, the next chapter will be up soon, seeing as I have nothing else to do with my time. Summer vacation still fresh and new, and I've made it through a stressful time. Anyway, thank you and I hope you enjoyed this chapter.[Chapter 3] Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 3: The Hero A young man the size of a man's thumb strolled along with his pet mouse, whistling a happy tune. He smiled at his surroundings, glad to be out in the world. His mouse squeaked happily and nuzzled his face. He chuckled. \"I'm glad to be away from England, too, Chester.\" He hugged the light brown mouse next to him. Then, he hopped onto its back. \"Let's get going. An adventure is bound to find us.\" Then, a loud scream made Chester stop in his tracks and look around. \"HELP!\" The young man put a hand on top of his brown-hair covered head. \"Someone must be in trouble. Let's go find them!\" He pulled on the fur on Chester's neck, turning him to the left a bit. \"The scream came from this way!\" On the stage, a frog priest stood in front of Bumper and Penelope. She was squirming around in the grip of the pale green helper frogs. Bumper looked over at her with a wide smile on his face. Grundel and his wife, Freda, looked on in pride. Their son was finally getting married, even if it was for Grundel's revenge plan. Freda smiled happily, looking forward to being able to have a daughter-in-law to talk to and dress up. However, Grundel looked forward to seeing the sad look on Thumbelina's face when he brought his son and Penelope to them for a final visit. After that, he would make sure that the fairy princess would never see her family again. Penelope kicked around as the frog priest cleared his throat. \"Do you, Bumper, take Princess Penelope to be your wife?\" \"I do!\" Bumper yelled excitedly. The priest nodded, and then turned to the struggling fairy. She frowned at him. \"Do you, Princess Penelope, take Bumper to be your husband?\" \"Never!\" She shouted angrily. She yanked her bound hands away when Bumper tried to hold them. \"I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about you. I can't possibly marry you.\" she said to the young toad. Bumper looked sadly at the ground for a moment, thinking over what Penelope had just said. Then, he turned to his father. \"Papa, you said she'd say 'yes!' Why didn't she say 'yes?!'\" \"I just told you!\" Penelope yelled in exasperation. Just then, the brunette boy rode by on his mouse. He looked and saw that the trouble was on an old boat. He nodded in determination. He hopped off of Chester and started hopping on the lily-pads over to the boat. Everyone was too busy with the wedding to notice him. The brunette hopped onto the stage and cleared his throat. \"It looks to me that this young lady could use a hero!\" He stood, straight and tall, as he spoke in his strong British accent. Penelope blinked in surprise. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Tom Thumb! A brave hero from England.\" He exclaimed proudly. Tom looked at the family of toads and frowned. \"You all need to learn some manners. If the young lady says she doesn't want to get married, you've no right to force her.\" Grundel puffed out his chest. \"Who are you to talk to me like that? I suggest you leave now before there's trouble.\" He glowered at Tom. Chuckling lightly, Tom patted his side, as if making sure something was there. \"That's nice of you, to suggest that. But, I have means to protect myself.\" Grundel snapped his fingers. Then, he and his helper frogs were surrounding Tom. While Bumper hopped over to help his father, Penelope looked to make sure everyone was too busy worrying about Tom. She sneakily made her way over to Chester, who had swam over to the boat. The brown mouse bit through the thread and vines on Penny's wrists, being careful not to accidentally bite the princess. Penelope smiled warmly and gently pet Chester's head. \"Thank you. Let's get to the shore while Tom's fighting them off.\" She said, looking back at Tom Thumb as he fought off the frogs. She climbed onto Chester's back and reached back to untie her wings as the mouse swam back to shore. Tom smirked at the frogs as he held a small dagger in front of him in defense. \"Come on. Show me what you've got.\" he challenged. When one of the helpers jumped to grab him, Tom leaned down close to the ground, dodging the frog. He leaned back up and sweep-kicked Grundel and Bumper. Freda and the frog priest watched in shock. Tom grabbed some old vines that were hanging from the roof of the stage and hog-tied Grundel and Bumper. The brunette ran over to the edge of the stage and hopped onto the back of his faithfully awaiting mouse. He turned back to Freda and the priest. \"Don't come after us! Or... I'll be forced to actually use this.\" He waved his dagger at them. Chester swam back to shore and carried Tom Thumb a good distance away from the boat. Tom jumped off of his mouse's back and looked around. \"W-where's the young lady?\" he asked Chester. Chester squeaked a few times and trotted over to a few blades of grass that were folded over each other in a way. Penelope slowly came out from behind the grass and gave Tom a small smile. \"Thank you for saving me.\" \"Oh, it was no trouble at all.\" Tom said, grinning. He held his hand out to her. \"I'm Tom Thumb.\" Penny laughed a bit. \"So you said before.\" She shook his hand. \"I'm Penelope.\" The brunette boy nodded, blushing slightly from embarrassment. He thought that Penelope was very beautiful and kind, which made him want to make sure she returned home safely. \"So, Penelope, where is your house?\" \"Oh, I live in the Vale of the Fairies.\" She answered almost immediately. The 2 started walking as Chester scampered along behind them. \"'Vale of the Fairies?'\" Tom questioned. Then, he looked and saw Penelope's wings. \"Oh. What happened to your wings?\" He could see that they had been damaged. Penny frowned. \"Those frogs weren't too careful with them when they tied me up. Now, I can't even fly.\" She crossed her arms and pouted. Tom covered his mouth to muffle his chuckling. She looked like a child that was put in time-out. But, he recomposed himself and responded. \"I'm sorry. But, I'm sure Chester wouldn't mind carrying you on his back when you get tired of walking.\" Chester squeaked in agreement. The fairy princess smiled back at the brown mouse before turning back to the young man next to her. \"Do you know where the Vale is? I remember you said that you were from England.\" \"Sure. I've been in France a while now. I can... find it.\" Tom said, hesitating a bit. \"'Find' it?\" Penny questioned. She raised an eyebrow at him. \"So, you don't know where it is?\" \"I'm sure I'll know it when I see it...\" Tom looked around. \"But, we should probably stop and ask for directions. Just in case we've started in the opposite direction.\" Tom smiled sheepishly at the redhead, earning him a semi-glare. Penelope was beginning to believe that she wouldn't see her home for a long time if this man was to be her 'hero.'[Chapter 4] Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 4: Prayer Princess Penelope watched Tom as he practiced some sparing moves. She looked back at her wings and sighed sadly. They were still bent at the base where they connected to her back and there were a few rips in them. She hoped that they would heal soon. Penny smiled as Chester nuzzled her in an attempt to comfort her. She hugged the brown mouse's head gently. \"Thanks, Chester.\" The mouse squeaked happily. Tom looked up in alarm. Hushed voices could be heard as some grass rustled nearby. The brunette backed away from it and stood protectively in front of Penelope. \"Be wary. We've got company...\" Then, 3 insects stepped into view. A bee, a gnat, and a bug of some kind. Penny perked up at the sight of them. \"Gnatty! Baby Bug! Li'l Bee!\" She smiled brightly and ran to hug them. \"Princess!\" They all ran to give the redhead a group hug. Tom and Chester shared a confused glance before the brunette spoke up. \"Alright, what is going on here? Who are they?\" He pointed his sword at the group of bugs. Penelope used the tip of her finger to gently push Tom's sword away from Gnatty, Li'l Bee, and Baby Bug. \"Tom, these are my friends. They helped my mother when she was younger.\" She turned and introduced them to her new companions. \"Guys, this is Tom Thumb and his riding mouse, Chester. They're going to help me get back home.\" Gnatty scratched the back of his head. \"What do you mean, 'get back home?'\" \"That nasty toad, Grundel, stole me away from the Vale.\" Penny grimaced at the memory of the toad and his awkward son. \"He was trying to get me to marry his son.\" Baby Bug gasped fearfully. \"Grundel? He's back?!\" \"How did he survive?\" Li'l Bee asked. Penelope shrugged. \"I don't know. He didn't tell me. But, I don't really care, as long as he and his son stay away from me.\" She crossed her arms and sat down a nearby pebble. \"Penelope, we should really get -\" Tom was interrupted by the sounds of wings flapping. The group looked up, but there weren't any birds flying overhead. \"What on Earth was-\" The wings were heard again. \"Maybe it's the fairies from the Vale!\" Penelope gasped hopefully, clapping her hands together happily. Then, a large swarm of hornets flew above them all. All the happiness inside of the fairy princess at that moment disappeared, and was instantly replaced with fear and panic. The swarm flew down to them and circled them quickly. The group was forced to huddle together to keep away from the hornets' stingers. Tom swung his sword at the invading pests as quickly as he could. But, a hornet got too close and its stinger nicked Tom's arm. He hissed in pain and fell back into the group. Chester squeaked loudly in fear and worry for his master. \"Tom!\" Penny tried to get over to him, but the swarm had begun to change their direction of flying. Now, instead of a steady circle, they were weaving through the group and had separated Tom, Chester, and Li'l Bee from Gnatty, Baby Bug, and Penelope. The princess screamed when she saw how far apart she and her 2 friends were from the others. \"Tom! Li'll Bee! Chester!\" Baby Bug gasped and pointed at the sky. \"Look!\" The small group of 3 looked up and saw that a very large hornet that was wearing a crown was motioning to the smaller hornets to follow her. The swarm broke into 3 large groups, each group carrying someone from off the ground. Penelope jerked around in a failed attempt to free herself. Then, she noticed how far off the ground she was. If the hornets did let her go now, she would plummet to the ground and easily get injured. Defeated, she allowed the hornets to carry her and her friends off to wherever they were going. Meanwhile, Queen Thumbelina sighed sadly as she sat on the edge of her bed. She and King Cornelius had sent out messengers and groups of fairies to look for their daughter. All of them had came back saying the same thing: \"We couldn't find her...\" Thumbelina was beginning to believe that she would never see her daughter again. She walked over to the window of her bedroom and stared at the sky. She then remembered her mother telling her about a greater being watching over everyone, making sure that everybody was safe and sound. So, she knelt down, clasped her hands together, and began praying. \"Please, wherever my daughter is... Let her at least be safe. Even if she never finds her way back to the Vale of the Fairies... She's never been outside of the Vale before.\" Thumbelina paused a moment, wiping a tear from her eye. \"Watch over her, please...\" The fairy queen hoped that Penelope would find her way back to the Vale. But, even if she didn't, Thumbelina hoped that her child would find happiness in some other place. Thumbelina stood up and flew out to the fairy court. She found her husband, who was talking with some more messengers. \"Have they found anything? Did they find Penny?\" Cornelius sighed, shaking his head. \"No. But, they did find this.\" He handed his wife a piece of paper. Thumbelina read it and gasped. The paper was an announcement for all the pond residents to come to the celebration of the wedding of Bumper and Princess Penelope. \"Bumper? Who is that?\" Thumbelina asked the messenger fairy. The messenger paused a moment, then answered. \"He is the son of Grundel.\" Cornelius and Thumbelina both gasped. The fairy king's hands clenched into fists as his queen covered her mouth in an attempt to contain her sobs. \"He made Penny marry his son?!\" Cornelius asked, anger flooding his voice. The blonde messenger cowered slightly at the king's tone. He regained his composure and cleared his throat. \"I'm not sure, but we were able to find Grundel's old family boat.\" Thumbelina wiped her eyes quickly and held onto her husband's arm. \"Take us there. Now, please.\" she said, her voice strong with determination. As they flew out of the Vale, Queen Thumbelina stayed silent, her thoughts completely focused on her daughter. 'We'll find you, Penny. Don't worry.'[Chapter 5] Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 5: A New Friend, An Old Enemy Tom slowly opened his eyes, having woken up from his recent fainting. He looked down at his arm and saw that it was bandaged up. \"What in the world?\" he gasped, starting to sit up. Then, he felt someone push him back down. \"You'll need yer strength if you're goin' to rescue the princess.\" The brunette looked to his side and saw a large, dark blue rolly-polly. The beetle was wearing a large black top-hat that looked rather old. He was also wearing a black dress jacket. The rolly-polly tipped his hat to Tom Thumb and declared, \"The name's Rolland Poller.\" Just then, Li'l Bee poked his head into the room. \"Can I come in, Mr. Poller?\" When Rolland nodded, Li'l Bee rushed into the room and grabbed firmly onto Tom's shoulders. \"You have to save Penelope!\" \"What? What do you mean? Where is she?!\" Tom began to sit up in the leaf-constructed bed he was in. Rolland intervened and gently shoved Tom back down. He sat Li'l Bee in a chair beside him. \"Settle yerselves down, now. Don't get excited.\" He clapped his hand onto Li'l Bee's back, surprising the young bee slightly. \"Li'l Bee 'ere's been tellin' me bout yer run-in wit' the hornets.\" Tom nodded slowly. \"Li'l Bee, what happened to Princess Penelope?\" \"She, Gnatty, and Baby Bug got carried away.\" He replied, looking down in dismay. He looked up at the brunette with small tears in his eyes. \"I'm worried about them, Tom. Who knows what those hornets have done to them?\" Rolland dismissed Li'l Bee's comment with a wave of his hand. \"Them hornets ain't viscous. Not 'til you cross 'em. Yer friends'll be fine as long as they do as they're told.\" Tom's face paled. \"That could be a problem...\" \"Why is that, now?\" The rolly-polly asked, groaning as he lifted himself from his seat. \"As long as the hornets don't try to force her to marry anyone, she should be okay.\" Tom told him as Rolland grabbed a cup of water for him. Meanwhile, Grundel was being interrogated about the princess's whereabouts. \"Where is my daughter?\" King Cornelius asked him with a glare. The large toad said nothing. He only glared at the fairy couple in front of him. Cornelius' glare deepened. \"If you don't tell us where Penelope is, you and your son will be charged for kidnapping!\" When Grundel continued to stay silent, Thumbelina stepped in. \"Please, Grundel. We're begging you. Think of how you would feel if someone kidnapped Bumper.\" She inwardly smiled when she saw Grundel's face flash an expression of worry and dread. \"As a parent, you can understand how worried we are.\" Grundel nodded slowly. Then, he smirked. \"I won't tell you.\" Thumbelina suddenly grabbed the collar of Grundel's clothes and shook him violently. \"TELL ME WHERE MY BABY IS!\" Cornelius and the fairy messenger had to pry her hands off of the toad to keep her from choking the life out of him. Grundel stumbled backward, gasping for breath. No one had expected the queen to blow up like she had. Thumbelina took a few deep breaths, smoothed out her skirts and bodice, and turned away from everyone. She, then, fell to her knees and began sobbing. Cornelius turned to Grundel's wife and their son, Bumper. \"Would either of you happen to know where our daughter went?\" \"She left me!\" Bumper whined. \"She left with that Tom guy and his mouse! She was supposed to be my wife! But, she left me!\" \"Where did they go?\" The fairy king asked, made slightly uncomfortable by the young toad's rambling. Freda stepped in. \"They went off somewhere over there. The young man that took her had a sword, you should be careful. But, please, let my husband go?\" She asked kindly. Cornelius pulled out his sword and cut loose the ropes around Grundel's wrists. The toad went over to his family and sat beside them. Cornelius went over to his wife and rubbed her back affectionately. \"It's okay, Thumbelina. We'll find them, don't worry.\" Thumbelina turned toward him and hugged him tightly. \"What if we don't find her in time? What if something bad happens to her?\" \"She's going to be just fine. We're going to find her and bring her home.\" At that time, the hornets were placing Penelope, Gnatty, and Baby Bug in individual, cramped spaces in their large nest. Once they were in place, the hornets just left them there. Baby Bug turned her head to look at her friends, who were on either side of her. \"Hey! Are you two okay?!\" \"I'm fine.\" Gnatty answered quickly. He tried to look around Baby Bug to look at Princess Penelope. \"Princess, are you okay?\" Penny sniffled and choked back some sobs. She held her head down and felt her shoulders hunch upward with every sob, since the rest of her body was too confound to move. \"Tom...\" she whispered. Baby Bug looked to her right at the princess. \"What?\" \"Tom... What if he's dead?\" Penelope's hair fell over her face. \"He got cut on a hornet's stinger. What if he dies from it? He can't die!\" The young fairy stopped trying to talk and just cried. She honestly didn't want Tom to be dead. Not only because he'd saved her, but because he was a good person, and she had grown to think of him as a friend. 'If he's dead because of me, I'll never forgive myself.' Penny silently vowed to herself. ","Summary":" Penelope and Tom Thumb Chapter 1: The Little Princess Every fairy in the Vale was happy when Cornel"},{"Movie":"Thumbelina","Title":"What Could Have Been","Author":"AngelFace273","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8579339","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I love and adore Don Bluth's Thumbelina with all my heart and soul. No question. It's cute, it's fun, it's romantic, it's funny, there's singing, and it all wraps up in a big happy ending. It is my feel-good movie, and I will fight anyone who badmouths it. However, even I can't help but notice a few moments where the happy ending could have come just a bit sooner if the characters (mostly Thumbelina) had done just one little something different. This is also a chance for me to really get into the minds of some of the characters, which may be played upon in another story. So here are 5 \"what if\" instances, starting from the end of the movie to the beginning, that I feel could have gone differently. Absently twisting the ring on her finger, Thumbelina stood behind the curtains, waiting for her cue from the organist. She was determined not to get cold feet now, moments before her wedding. She wished her mother was here, but Thumbelina could go visit her in the spring, right? That's what Ms. Field-mouse had said, and she owed Ms. Field-mouse so much already. Saving her from the cold, feeding and housing her, setting up her wedding to Mr. Mole, Thumbelina should've been grateful and happy. Cornelius would have wanted her to be happy, right? Cornelius… The name shot through her heart, warming and clenching it at the same time. Just then, the organist played her cue and the curtain rose. Thumbelina took once last glance at her ring before covering it with her other hand and started the wedding march. But as she walked, her mind was still stuck on her late beloved. Happening to look to her right, Thumbelina saw her reflection in the glass and could easily picture Cornelius standing next to it, singing their song. Let me be your wings, Let me be your only love, Let me take far beyond the stars… \"Uh, Mr. Mole. Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?\" The voice of the priest snapped Thumbelina out of her trance, and she whirled back to the front to resume walking. She only made it a few more paces before the urge to look at her ring again beckoned to her like a siren's song. The emerald gem reminded her of Cornelius' eyes so strongly that Thumbelina could have sworn that his face was part of its shine, and their song echoed in her head. Let me be your wings, Let me lift you high above, Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours… \"Ahem. I do.\" Struggling, Thumbelina tore her eyes from her ring at Mr. Mole's voice only for the melting wax in the candle to grab her attention, the vision of her prince already there singing his heart out to her. Anything that you desire, Anything at all… \"And Thumbelina, do you take this Mole to be your lawful wedded husband?\" But Thumbelina was still too deep in memories to fully acknowledge the priest. Images of Cornelius and their night together rolled through her head before a particularly vivid one played out. \"Do not forget me?\" Thumbelina begged as she took her new necklace off and gently placed it around Cornelius' neck. She was terrified of waking up and discovering this was all a dream, or worse, Cornelius waking tomorrow morning and thinking it was just a dream. She wasn't sure she'd be able to live if he forgot about this night, though she knew she'd never be able to forget. Thumbelina wanted this moment to last forever. Cornelius' eyes softened and filled with love as he looked at his new accessory. \"'Forget-Me-Not's,\" he breathed, before remembering the royal ring on his finger. \"Oh, I'll never forget you,\" he vowed as he took the ring off and slipped it on her left ring finger. A perfect fit. \"Never.\" \"Never, never,\" Thumbelina replied, and they leaned into each other, the gap between their lips shrinking… \"Speak up!\" The voice of the priest prompting her broke through her trance once more, but Thumbelina's heart was decided. She simply couldn't follow through with this wedding. If she married without love, her life would be empty and meaningless. And this mole, no matter how rich he was, could never gain her heart and love. \"Never,\" she murmured. \"I beg your pardon?\" the priest gasped, startled. He'd performed weddings for years, and he was sure that wasn't in the script. Thumbelina looked up at the priest, emboldened by finally being able to speak for herself since she was kidnapped. \"Never!\" she repeated, her voice growing in intensity. \"I cannot marry Mr. Mole. I don't love him!\" Suddenly, she glanced over to said mole. He looked thunderstruck and a little hurt, and Thumbelina's intensity softened. Though Mr. Mole was greedy, vain, ugly, and a rather horrid person altogether, he had been nice to her, cared about her, and had just wanted her companionship. She supposed that he did deserve a proper explanation. Placing her hand on his arm, Thumbelina spoke kindly yet firmly, \"I'm sorry Mr. Mole, but we are just too different. You are a creature of riches and the dark. I will always be yearning for nature and the sun every single day, and no amount of jewels or gold can ever change that. And I know now that I could never marry someone who doesn't hold my heart. You are a good mole, so you deserve better than a girl who cannot love you.\" Mr. Mole bowed his head in acknowledgement. \"I understand,\" he murmured. \"I won't hold you here if you do not wish to be.\" Beaming, Thumbelina gave Mr. Mole a brief hug before running back down the aisle to head for the surface. Halfway down the aisle though, Grundel the toad burst through the ceiling with a yell and landed right in front of Thumbelina. \"You!\" she gasped. The toad from the family who kidnapped her! The one she was almost forced to marry! \"I marry her!\" Grundel proclaimed proudly, holding his arms out as if he expected her to happily leap into them. However, hearing those words again filled Thumbelina with more anger and frustration than she'd ever felt in her life. In fact, the look on her face caused Grundel's smile to vanish and his arms to droop a little, confusion and fear flashing across his face. Stomping right up in his face, Thumbelina shouted, \"Why won't you just leave me alone! You've been following me this entire time, all in the hope that I'd marry you! You never even thought that maybe I didn't want you? I ran at the thought of being your wife!\" Tears pricked her eyes as she grew quieter, though just as angry. \"The only man I'll ever love is dead because your mother kidnapped me! So I no marry you, I go home !\" With that, Thumbelina pushed Grundel out of her way and marched down the aisle. The toad fell onto his butt, too stunned and terrified to even think of following her. Finally making it out from the church, Thumbelina began retracing the path to Ms. Fieldmouse's home in her head, planning on changing out of her silly wedding dress and going up outside. However, her path was obstructed once again by none other than Mr. Beetle. \"Hiya, toots!\" he proclaimed, grinning toothily. Thumbelina, still angry from seeing Grundel again, had zero tolerance for Mr. Beetle's antics at the moment. \"I'm not your toots!\" she snapped, glaring at him. \"I don't know what you're doing here, but I really don't care! You forced me to be part of your stupid ball, embarrassed me in front of an audience, and called me ugly, so I never want to see you again! Now get out of my way and don't ever come near me again!\" Mr. Beetle, being a very big coward, quickly scurried far to the side, muttering apologies as he moved. Thumbelina, satisfied, continued down the path, ripping off the frilly collar on her neck and reaching up to undo her hair as she went to help placate her anger a little. Hair down and anger gone, Thumbelina strolled down the path that she remembered led to Ms. Fieldmouse's burrow. Daydreaming about the possibility of the sun being out again, she didn't even notice Gnatty the Jitterbug until he flew right into her. Startled, Thumbelina looked down to see Gnatty hugging her waist with all his might. \"Thumbelina!\" he cried, ecstatic. \"We've been looking all over for you! I almost thought we'd never find you in these tunnels, but I remembered Jaquimo telling us to just follow our hearts, so I did, and I found you!\" \"Gnatty!\" Thumbelina laughed, hugging him back. \"Take a moment to breathe! I've missed you so much. Where's Li'l Bee and Baby Bug? They are with you, right?\" Gnatty blinked for a moment, then let go of Thumbelina to fly a bit further down the tunnel. \"Oh yeah, they're down this way!\" Turning to the darkness ahead, Gnatty shouted as loud as he could, \"HEY GUYS! I FOUND HER! I FOUND THUMBELINA!\" Cries of relief and the fluttering of wings was what Thumbelina heard from the darkness as she waited with excitement at the thought of seeing her friends again. The very last thing she expected to see as well was Cornelius, alive and well, flying from the darkness to land next to Gnatty. She could hardly believe her eyes, and was in such a state of shock that she didn't even notice the Jitterbugs hovering next to her. \"You,\" she breathed, tears beginning to run down her face. \"It's you. Cornelius, you're alive!\" And with that, the two ran for each other, and collided into such an embrace that one would think they were trying to mold into a single being. They took a moment to look into each other's eyes, before connecting into the sweetest and most loving kiss the world had ever known. I hope you enjoyed! A review would be greatly appreciated.[Chapter 2] Backpedalling a lot further back in the movie, to when Thumbelina meets Berkley Beetle for the first time. Humming and dancing with her new Jitterbug friends, Thumbelina was confident that she'd soon be home with her mother and in her beloved Cornelius' arms if she'd just follow her heart, just like Jaquimo had sung. But until then, she was content with enjoying her journey with these three children. That is, until they noticed something she didn't, screamed a warning, and then scattered for cover before Thumbelina even knew what was happening. She barely had time to look around before a creepy black stick-like creature jumped directly in front of her with an \"Ah-ha!\" It laughed at her shriek of fright and startlement before grinning at her toothily. \"Hiya, toots!\" he drawled, strutting towards her. \"Beetle's my name, and razzmatazz is my game. How d'you do, how're ya feeling, everything okay?\" Leaning in, Beetle tickled his moustache-like antennae in her face. \"I'm not your toots!\" Thumbelina squirmed, batting the antennae away. \"Where did you come from?\" \"Where? Up there!\" twirling around, Beetle leaned against a nearby mushroom. \"I'm a connoisseur of sweet nectars! A designer of rare threads, and a judge of beautiful women.\" At that, he leered at her before trapping her with his cane and spinning her until her back was to the mushroom. \"And you, are bee-utiful ! Miss, um…\" Feeling rather uncomfortable, Thumbelina batted his antennae away from her face again while attempting to answer. \"Ah, um, Thumbelina, and I'm going home.\" Finally able to get out of his arms, she turned to do just that only to find the beetle had zipped around the mushroom to block her path again. \"What's your hurry, toots?\" he drawled, tickling his antennae in her face again. \" Relax ! Take a load off!\" \"Eugh!\" Thumbelina squirmed, disgusted, batting away the antennae once more. \"I wish you wouldn't do that!\" She managed to walk past him a bit before he grabbed her arm, holding her back. \"Perhaps you'd prefer, this?\" On the last word, Beetle planted a loud smooch on her arm, and continued to loudly kiss up and down her arm. \"Mr. Beetle!\" she gasped, shocked and embarrassed. \"I don't even know you! Would you stop?\" \"Stop? How can I stop!\" he exclaimed, spinning to her other side and continuing to kiss her hands between each sentence. \"I'm crazy about 'bout you, toots. You're gorgeous!\" Thumbelina started giggling from Beetle's flattering, not even noticing when his next kiss accidentally missed her hand and met his own, nor when his flattery began to refer to himself as he kissed his own hand between each sentence. \"Oh, you're exciting. Ooh, delicious!\" \"I am?\" Thumbelina asked, flattered in spite of herself. Remembering he was trying to flirt with her and not himself, Beetle leaned in conspiratorially. \"And, I love the sound of your voice.\" \"My voice…\" Thumbelina half-sung, putting a hand to her throat. \"Don't talk!\" Beetle interrupted her, moving right up in her face. \" Sing . Sing to me.\" Here Thumbelina hesitated. She just had the idea of asking Mr. Beetle to fly her up to the treetops, so she could see if she was even traveling in the right direction, but there was a slight problem. She barely knew this bug, she had said so herself. So surely it would be rather rude to ask such a favour of an almost complete stranger, even one who was so nice and complimentary to her. Mentally shrugging, Thumbelina figured that the best course of action was to say goodbye to Mr. Beetle and continue home. \" It was nice meeting you ,\" she sang. \" But I really must go. \" Turning around, she tried walking away again until Beetle zipped right in front of her once more. \"Seriously toots, where's the fire?\" Beetle frowned. What was with this girl? He had laid the schmoozing on as thick as he could, and she was still trying to leave! \"Look, if you really want me to stop with the kissing and the tickling, I'll stop. Don't go running off cuz of li'l old me.\" \"Oh no, it's not because of you!\" Thumbelina quickly assured him. \"It's just that Mother is probably worried sick by now, and Cornelius was supposed to call for me at my house, so I don't want him to think I'm avoiding him or anything-\" \"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!\" Beetle interrupted, catching a very important detail in all that rambling. \"Did you say Cornelius ? As in the Royal Fairy Prince Cornelius? One of the big fairy honchos himself? You're datin' him ?\" Slightly taken aback, Thumbelina hesitantly replied, \"Oh, um, yes. Prince Cornelius and I are in love.\" Beetle mentally rubbed his hands together with glee. Everyone this side of the Veil had heard that the Fairy Prince had finally been bitten by the love-bug, and right here was the dame responsible! That's why she wasn't reacting the right way to his flirting! Whoa, wait, back up a bit. Beetle blinked. He'd been flirting with her. Crap, he'd been flirting with the Fairy Prince's girl like there was no tomorrow! There was no doubt she'd tell the prince all about her little adventure, and when she did, the prince was gonna skewer him! C'mon, you idiot, think! He scrambled his brain for a solution. There's gotta be a way to fix this… Bingo! \"Say, uh, sweet stuff,\" Beetle finally spoke. \"You said you gotta get home to meet up with your prince, right? Why don't I help you with that?\" \"Really?\" Thumbelina asked, excited. \"If you'd just fly me up to the treetops so I know what direction I need to go, I'd be ever so grateful!\" \"You know what, gorgeous? I'll do you one better,\" Beetle grinned toothily at her. \"Put in a good word for me with the prince, and I will personally fly you to your doorstep. Whaddya say?\" \"You'd do that? For me?\" Thumbelina was getting really excited now, and would have agreed and let him fly her off that second had she not remembered something. \"Just one moment.\" Turning to the tall grass surrounding them, she called out, \"Li'l Bee? Gnatty? Baby Bug? Are you still here? Please come out!\" The Jitterbugs in question each popped their heads up one by one from behind a rock. Slowly, the three flew out to stand in front of Thumbelina, eyeing Beetle cautiously. Thumbelina bent down to be at eye-level with them. \"Jitterbugs,\" she began kindly. \"Mr. Beetle here has offered to take me home from here. If you happen to see Cornelius or Jaquimo, will you let them know?\" The three looked at each other for a moment, then turned to her. \"Of course,\" Li'l Bee agreed. \"Definitely!\" Gnatty exclaimed. \"Anything for you, Thumbelina,\" chimed Baby Bug. Thumbelina beamed at all of them. \"Thank you so much! You've all been such wonderful friends.\" She hugged all three, then straightened and turned to the other bug trying to wait patiently. \"Mr. Beetle,\" she announced. \"You have yourself a deal!\" Beetle grinned, then put an arm around her waist, reminding himself to be gentle and keep his hands in one place. She was the future Fairy Princess, after all. \"Then point the way, beautiful!\" And with that, Beetle took off, Thumbelina looking back and waving to the Jitterbugs before pointing the way home. Said bugs stayed, watching, until they could no longer see Thumbelina and Mr. Beetle. Then they looked at each other for one moment before Baby Bug yelled, \"Race you home!\" and took off. Li'l Bee grinned, then followed suit while shouting, \"Last one there's a big ugly wart-face!\" Gnatty, being the smallest and the slowest, blinked before chasing after them, crying, \"Hey! No fair, guys! Wait for me!\" I hope you enjoy! I'd really appreciate it if you left a review.[Chapter 3] This one takes place when Thumbelina meets the Jitterbugs, immediately after they save her from the waterfall. \"Look Mama, she's waking up.\" That was the first thing Thumbelina heard as she came to, groaning. She must've passed out from all the excitement and panic of trying to avoid the waterfall and get to shore. \"Oh, are you feeling better, little one?\" That was Jaquimo, her new friend. He had been trying to help her out of the water, and he must've succeeded. \"Yes, I think so,\" Thumbelina answered softly, sitting up. Then she noticed the crowd around her, and she woke up completely. \"But, who are you?\" she asked bewildered, looking around at everyone. \"Thumbelina,\" Jaquimo announced, and the girl in question turned to look at him for answers. \"These are the Jitterbugs.\" \"The Jitterbugs?\" she echoed, looking around again, before remembering her manners. \"Oh! How do you do?\" She noticed one of the Jitterbugs had moved to stand right next to her, a rather small one, and her heart melted. It was so cute! Then it spoke in a sweet and innocent voice, and Thumbelina had to restrain herself from hugging it with all her might. \"Are you really gonna marry the fairy prince?\" Blushing and giggling, Thumbelina figured that the little bug had seen them flying around last night. She supposed that she and Cornelius hadn't been very subtle about the whole thing, singing their hearts out to each other for everyone to hear. \"If he asks me,\" she told the Jitterbug, feeling rather proud. \"He will call for me at my house.\" That's when a thought occurred to her. He had said he'd call for her in the morning . Unless she was mistaken, it was definitely past morning. How did he react when he arrived only to find her gone? \"He must be out looking for me,\" Thumbelina thought aloud, then sighed wistfully. \"But how will he find me?\" \"Aw, we'll help you, Thumbelina!\" comforted the little bug next to her. Immediately the other Jitterbugs chimed in support. \"You can stay with us!\" \"Right!\" \"He'd definitely be able to find you around here!\" \"Yeah!\" \"No fear!\" \"You are all very kind, and thank you,\" Thumbelina interrupted, touched, but still feeling too pessimistic. \"But I'm afraid I will never see Cornelius again, or my mother, or…\" Burying her face in her hands, she began to feel despair creep up on her. Jaquimo frowned. He considered himself an expert on romance, especially the seemingly impossible ones. In his opinion, this situation seemed rather simple and not at all impossible. Stay with the Jitterbugs and wait for the fairy prince to come find her. Did this tiny girl have no faith in love or her prince? Perhaps her love for him was weak, as sad as the thought was. Only one way to find out… \"Do you love the prince?\" Looking up at him, she replied in the affirmative with such desperate love and passion that Jaquimo almost felt guilty for ever doubting her feelings. \"Well then follow your heart!\" He announced gaily. \"It is saying the fairy prince will find you!\" Sighing again, Thumbelina just shook her head and waved the thought away, saying, \"It's impossible.\" Hmph , Jaquimo thought. That's what she said about the lily pad, and that was easy! \"Impossible?\" he scoffed out loud. \"Nothing is impossible!\" Hopping off the rock, he felt a song coming on, and he knew he had to use it to give this little one hope. You're, sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart… Cornelius felt cold. He felt lost. He felt tired and bruised and desperate. He'd been searching for days and still no sign of Thumbelina. What if she was more lost than he was? What if she was trapped somewhere, waiting for him to rescue her? What if she was hurt, laying somewhere sick or injured? What if she was de- No! Don't think like that! Cornelius thought fiercely. She has to be around here somewhere, fine and well! But where? His father wouldn't be able to hold back the frost for long. Spotting the communal home of the Jitterbugs, he felt a dash of hope and relief. The Jitterbugs were well-known for their kindness and hospitality, and there was a chance they knew something about Thumbelina. In the worst-case scenario (that he'd let himself think about), they would gladly let him have a moment to rest and escape the wind and cold. Without hesitation, Cornelius steered Buzz to the log entrance of the Jitterbug home. Once they landed, he quickly hopped off the bee and removed his helmet with a sigh of relief. Looking around, he wasn't surprised to see a good amount of Jitterbugs already assembled and watching him, murmuring to each other. As kind as they were, the Jitterbugs were also notorious gossips. If even one had seen him flying towards their home, more would have known about it before he even got close. Trying to catch his breath, Cornelius raised his voice to be heard over the mumbling. \"I-I'm looking for a beautiful young woman. Her name is-is Thumbelina.\" \"Are you really the fairy prince?\" Looking down, the prince in question saw a young Jitterbug, gazing up at him with hope and excitement. Cornelius smiled, it was kinda cute. \"I am,\" he told the bug, and it seemed to grow even more excited. \"Thumbelina's here!\" it exclaimed, and his heart seemed to stop for a moment. Could it be true? Before he could say anything, another Jitterbug, probably the younger one's mother, walked forward. \"Alright, Gnatty,\" she told it with a smile. \"Why don't you go with Li'l Bee and Baby Bug and get Thumbelina.\" Gnatty grinned happily, \"Okay, Mama!\" then raced off with two other young Jitterbugs further down the log. The mother then turned to Cornelius, who was frozen in place. \"Now why don't you take a seat right here, your highness,\" she urged him, leading him to a bit of wood fashioned like a bench. \"You must be worn to the bone.\" Cornelius simply let himself be gently pushed onto the bench, his legs shaky and so in shock at the thought of having finally found her that he just couldn't refuse. Once sitting though, he remembered his manners enough to say, \"Oh, uh, thank you, Miss…\" \"Just call me Mama, dear,\" she waved. \"Everyone does, even Thumbelina.\" His attention caught, the fairy prince looked up at her with hope and something akin to fear. \"She's really here?\" After days of searching, would he finally get to hold her again? She chuckled and nodded. \"Been here since those toads left her. She said they wanted her to join their singing troupe and marry into their family, and left her on a lily pad while they went to go get the padre.\" Cornelius clenched his hands into fists as his eyes narrowed. How dare they! Stupid, arrogant, pompous toads… \"If it wasn't for Jaquimo the swallow,\" The Jitterbug continued, noticing the prince's anger. \"Who knows what would've happened. In fact, he's with Thumbelina now, instead of flying south for the winter. And good thing, too. He seemed to be the only one who could lift her spirits when she started to lose hope.\" Before Cornelius could question her further, his name was cried from deeper within the Jitterbug home, and he could distinctly hear footsteps running his way. He leapt to his feet, his heart in his throat and all thoughts wiped from his mind except one. Please let it be her… All he had for a warning as Thumbelina ran into view was her shouting his name again before she practically threw herself at him. Immediately he wrapped his arms around her waist before picking her up and spinning her around in sheer joy. Setting her on her feet once more, Cornelius held her with a death grip, as if he expected something to try and pry her away from him again. Not that Thumbelina was complaining, for she was squeezing him just as tightly. Fighting back the tears pricking his eyes, he managed to choke out, \"You are never leaving my sight again.\" Allowing his arms to loosen just enough to let her look at him, the dazzling smile Thumbelina gave in response was the last straw. Vaguely hearing the Jitterbugs cheering and celebrating around them, Cornelius closed his eyes and pressed his lips to hers. And in the back of his mind, he could've sworn he heard fireworks. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or leave reviews if you have any. I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 4] This new chapter takes place way early in the movie, after our lovely couple's famous song, immediately after Cornelius flew off into the night. Thumbelina sighed dreamily as she watched her new beloved fly off into the night. Did that really just happen? First she discovered that there were others her size, and they were fairies on top of that! Then she was given the chance to fly, and see some of the world past her front yard. And then , she'd managed to get her heart stolen by a handsome, sweet, kind, wonderful fairy, who happened to also be the fairy prince! Her head was still reeling from the idea that she was in love with a prince, and he loved her in return! And tomorrow she was going to meet his parents, and he'd get to meet Mother, and… Mother! Thumbelina blinked the stars from her eyes and brought her head back to earth. She needed to tell her mother about tomorrow! Thumbelina didn't want to surprise her too much with Cornelius, and Mother could help find a dress suitable for seeing royalty! Besides, now that the thought was there, Thumbelina thought she would burst if she didn't tell someone about the magical time she just had. Who better than her own mother? Running back inside, Thumbelina began crying \"Hero! Wake up, Hero!\" to alert the dog of her return. The dog in question wuffed, then raised his head in her direction, blinking blearily. The small girl quickly ran over to stand in front of Hero, who obligingly bent his head down to her eye level. Clasping her hands together, Thumbelina begged, \"Hero, could you please carry me to Mother? I need to talk to her.\" With a sigh, Hero lowered his head further to be level with the table and allowed Thumbelina to climb on top with a smile. Once she was settled on his head, the dog hopped down from his resting place and trotted down the stairs to the kitchen, where the woman in question happened to be doing some reading of her own by the fire before going to bed herself. Upon seeing her, Thumbelina stretched herself up to be more noticeable and began calling for her mother. Looking down, Thumbelina's mother saw her daughter waving to her from Hero's head. \"Thumbelina?\" she asked as she lowered her hand down to let her child clamber onto it. \"What are you doing still up? It is past your bedtime. Is something wrong?\" Thumbelina just couldn't contain her excitement. \"Mother! I met someone my size!\" she exclaimed. \"He saw me, and took me flying, oh and his name is Cornelius, and he's a fairy prince, and he wants me to meet his parents tomorrow and I asked him to meet you as well, and he agreed and he said he'll call for me in the morning, and he loves me!\" The larger woman blinked and stared at her little girl. You would too, if your daughter had told you such a tale all in one breath. Thumbelina had never lied before in her life, and while she loved stories, she was never one to make them up out of the blue like this. But a fairy prince? Then again, she was one to talk, with a daughter no bigger than her thumb. \"…Perhaps you should tell me what happened from the beginning,\" she finally decided. \"And then we can work out what needs doing from there.\" With a happy grin so big it was a wonder her face didn't crack, Thumbelina launched into her tale. Hero, seeing that his services were no longer needed, lumbered back up the stairs to go back to sleep. From the sound of it, Hero had a feeling that the two women downstairs were going to be up talking for quite a while. Mama Toad hopped onto the window ledge, taking a moment to catch her breath. That had taken some work, hopping all the way from her boat-home to get this chiquita to join her show. But it was worth it. With that voice in the group, Mama Toad and her family would soon have to swim through all their money just to get from backstage to front! Peeking through the window, Mama Toad saw an open walnut facing an upright human book. Squinting, she could make out a bit of bedding hanging off the side of the walnut. Gotcha! Quietly opening the window, Mama Toad hopped inside. She then hopped onto the table, then on top of the stack of books, then finally to just behind the walnut bed. Slowly, moving bit-by-bit, she peeked out from behind the walnut to look into the bed, her arms outstretched to snap the walnut shut- Only to find the bed empty. Horrified, Mama Toad cursed in heavy Spanish as she looked around the room for the little nina who'd make her show even more famous. This was literally the only chance she had to take her! Those pesky fairies wasted almost no time on courting when it came to love, and the royal family was no exception! If she didn't do it now, the prince would almost definitely come calling, whisk little Thumbelina off to the fairy court, and proceed to plan the wedding. After tonight, her tiny star-to-be would be constantly guarded until after the ceremony, and then to take away a member of the royal family, however new, was punishable by death! No, it had to be tonight. Thumbelina had to be here somewhere. Determined, Mama Toad scanned the room for any sign of a tiny girl no larger than a human's thumb… And found herself staring down a very large, very awake, and very annoyed, dog. Screeching, Mama Toad launched herself at the window to freedom, Hero snapping at her heels in hot pursuit. Sorry if this was too short. I'll leave it up to your imaginations as to whether or not Hero gets the Toad. I hope you enjoyed![Chapter 5] This is the last chapter of \"What Could Have Been\", sadly. It's set at the tail-end of Let Me Be Your Wings. It's pretty short, but this \"what if\" scenario is really a split-second decision change on Thumbelina and Cornelius' part. Mama Toad stepped out onto the stage of her boat-home for some fresh air, having finally removed all of her stage make-up from that night's performance. She walked over to the edge of the boat, where her eldest son, Grundel, was crouched, watching the pond. What for, she had no clue. As good as his voice was, Grundel was not the brightest firefly in the swamp. How she was ever going to find him a wife someday, she didn't know. \" We'll see the universe, And dance on Saturn's rings…\" Both mother and son glanced up to see two little people, and Mama Toad could make out at least one set of wings leaving a glittery trail behind them. Fairies, she realized, and it's probably a courting couple, judging by the love song. She recognized the male voice, even in harmony with another. Fairy Prince Cornelius was one of the few fairies that liked to travel around this side of the Veil without an escort or a parade. The female voice, however, was new. Mama Toad strained her ear-drums to hear the female's voice in a solo, without the Prince's voice harmonizing, but the couple had already flown over the boat and off to sing their vows of love elsewhere. Slightly disappointed, Mama Toad shrugged it off before heading out to catch some dinner. She was always on the lookout for some fresh talent for her family's show, and she had the feeling that girl fairy's voice would have been pretty decent. But since she couldn't know for sure, Mama Toad wouldn't bother chasing after her. Besides, the Fairy Prince was likely going to marry her soon, based on the passion in their song, so why go through the trouble of snatching up a girl who's voice was only \"pretty decent\" before the wedding? Grundel watched the fairy couple a few moments more than his mother, curiously squinting for a better look at what the two looked like, but gave up after they flew out of his sight. Snorting in slight distaste, Grundel finally stood and walked back inside the curtained area of his home. Fairy people were weird, he decided, falling in love at the drop of a hat, and singing it for everyone to know. They looked weird too, in his opinion. Grundel was glad he didn't have to deal with them much. Fairies were probably more trouble than they were worth. I truly hoped you enjoyed my story! I have at least two other Thumbelina plots in my head, but what with the twenty billion-ish other plot bunnies I have to work on I can honestly say that I have absolutely no clue when I'll be getting around to posting them. Please don't hesitate to leave a review! ","Summary":" I love and adore Don Bluth's Thumbelina with all my heart and soul. No question.

But, unlike thenother fanfics where I rape your childhood with sex and violence, thisnone won't be as raunchy. I cannot bear to ruin my most favoritenchildhood movie become filled with sex scenes and blood when I'mndoing this fanfic. And even though Mr. Beetle scares me, I'mnwriting a whole fic about him and symphazing with him! I guess I findnhim attractive yet creepy in a way… It's also sad thatnthey don't have Thumbelina in the moviensection. For clarification,nthis is a fanfic of Don Bluth's 1994 classic Thumbelina. Watch it you 90's kids. I'm sure many of you havenalready…it's a beautiful movie with songs that were successfullynimbedded in my head. When I recently watched it, I was freaked outnthat I remember the lyrics to many of the songs. ALL of them. –screams- Enjoy enjoy anperverted Mr. Beetle, bugs, wings and love…and this time, I'mnmost CERTAIN that I will NOT ruin this with SEX. Just pervertedness. Snaking his almostnspidery hands around the cane, the beetle swiftly got up from thenchair and began to stride to his rooms. He had had enough drinkingnfor now. The rest of the Beetle Ball would do fine without him therentonight. He tried not to shownit but there was a certain anger, yet sadness from what he wasnconstantly brooding on. He had tuned out the sounds and sights of thenbright nightclub he operated. The laughter, the singing, the dancing,nthe flashing lights and the taste of the fine food and spirits allnlost their luster. He crossed his arms behind his back as hendescended the staircase to his room for the night. \"Mr. Beetle that…Mr.nBeetle this!\" He muttered under his breath. He was now feelingnincredibly annoyed whenever the waiters and crew asked him questionsnabout this or that…he used to find it a joy when he was bossingnbugs around. But now, Berkeley Beetle was depressed. Trudging in he slammednthe door shut, his pair of whiskers drooping as he let himself assumena slouching position as he made his way to the bed. Immediately henfelt exhausted and he barely had the strength to get ready for bed.nSlowly he took apart his fancy attire as he headed for the closet,nlooking for his pajamas. Mr. Beetle sighed as he took off his fakenwings, looking at them and wishing he could fly again. Alas, only anfairy could give him his wings back. All his troubles were fornsomething that didn't work. His troubles were over and he stillnfelt troubled. Stripped and shiveringnto the air he put on his favorite night attire and quickly flopped onnthe bed. Oooooh dear… The beetle moaned in his head. The glow of the mushroom lights castnan eerie silence over the objects in the room. The wine glassesnglinted in the light, but they only sparkled a little. The world tonhim had turned dead like winter. But it was only early spring, a timenof life and joy and warmth and… Love. Hah! So muchnfor that happening! The poor beetle wasnlost without it. No ladybug, nor butterfly, no sweet ant or bee darednto go near him. He lacked one very appealing thing, and that was…hisnwings. Gone. Ripped from hisnback by a now deceased toad. He felt lack of charm.nThe lady he first thought beautiful, then ugly, and then beautifulnagain had turned into a fairy! He could have had a fairy by his side! Now she's withnthat prince, ruling the realm of bugs and nature alike…while Insurvived to crawl back to my dingy little tree… He lifted hisnweary head up to watch his hand as it opened the bedside table'sndrawer and pulled out a little picture frame. In it was a lock ofnhair. It was in the wedding invitation that he stole to get it. Henstill felt a longing for the princess Thumbelina, even though she hadncost him his wings, so much trouble, and almost his death. Why, if I hadn'tnpulled my head in my suit…I would have been decapitated! Hencringed at the thought of lying lifeless in Mr. Mole's home. Surly,nhe would have been pinned on his wall like the rest of the bugs henhas captured. He shivered as any reasonable bug would at the thought. Sighing he put thenlock of hair away. Every time he looked at it, he regretted it butnthen yearned for her even more. She was so beautiful…so naïve, sonyoung that he could do anything he wanted to her and she would havenbeen so weak…but alas, she was considered ugly by his crowd. Thennthe unfortunate toad forced him to get into an even worse mess and henlost his wings! He almost died too! And he almost had her as his own… He was an enemy to thenfairies now, this he knew. They would never use their magic to helpnhim. He wasn't even sure fairies were strong enough to give himnwings either…and Thumbelina would push him away as the disgustingnbeetle he was. \"What a perfectnpunishment. My will to drink, my carelessness in my fine threads andnbeautiful women know I can't fly!\" He was almost about to go intonanother of his frequent temper tantrums. \"It's not fair I tellnyou! NOT FAIR!\" Settling down henclenched his fists as he blew out the mushroom lights, and crawledninto his carved twig-work bed, to dream about the power he had whennhe could fly… A/N: Well how'd itngo first chapter? Pretty good? Also I am notntelling ANY of the plot to ANY of my watchers and friends! save fornone and half to another So my readers on here and DA have no cluenwhere the story is going to go! Is Mr. Beetle goingnto pursue Thumbelina? Will a magic salami give him wings? Will henfind love by marrying a slug? WHO KNOWS! And it'll onlynhappen if you review. Yay! With much love, Shoys.[Chapter 2] A/N: Well I tried to make this as not-too-perverted as I usually would write…turns out pretty good I think, what do you guys think? Enjoy and enjoy, as we introduce the Mar S- I mean OC Calliope. –forgive me!- The sweet morning of the spring day brought forth dew upon the grass and foliage of the meadow and woods. The day seemed innocent enough with the bright sun starting to warm the earth. It was here in the valley that the day began. The bugs came form their scattered homes, some closer together, others not so much, and went about the day. Moths and butterflies, bees and ants, beetles and centipedes and such got dressed and ate breakfast. Children insects were seen buzzing along to school in the old tree, ladybugs sweeping their front porches, and other Jitterbugs going about their day. The smell of baking bread came from the bakery at the patch of rocks. A grasshopper fiddled upon a blade of grass overlooking the river. There was laughter from the children. Mothers and other ladies gossiped on the gravel path in the main town center. There was the buzz of the bee colony that was at another tree. A rabbit stopped by, taking notice of the family picnic before she nibbled the grass around the June bug's family reunion. All was bliss as it should be. In fact, it was an even more blissful community because recently the prince of the fairies married, and that ensued joy upon the subjects of the kingdom. All respected the fey. In fact, some of the bugs worked for them, helping them in many things. After all, fairies aren't all perfect and enjoyed the talents of a finely tailored suit, or perhaps delicious food homemade without the fanciness of fairy spice. And that's what Calliope does. She stood in the doorway of her family's bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread and goodies always made her happy. After all, she had lived here her entire life. And now she was equally glad that she was helping the fairies. She always felt so…so happy around those fair-skinned people. As early as she could remember she and her family were friends with them. Because of that, they had plenty of wealth to live comfortably by. She played with the fairies, learned math and grammar by the fairies, and now that she was a young woman cricket she was learning dancing lessons and the secrets of fine cooking. Besides being a bakery, her mother was a cook, and operated a restaurant in the same building. \"Calliope!\" Her stout father called. Brushing his hands on his apron, her father huffed as went into the sunshine with her. Smiling he handed her a basket with bread and pies. \"Good morning father!\" Calliope said as she hugged her father. Her antenna twitched as she pulled away, looking at her own dress and noticing how much flour was on her. \"Ah, my little lady is covered with flowers! Get it?\" Her father chuckled warmly as he helped her brush off the white powder. She laughed with him and shook her wings of the white stuff. The gold from her wings glinted in the sun as she looked in the basket. \"What are these for?\" She said. Her father happily chirped. \"My dear Mrs. Juliana wanted these delivered. You know her right? Eh? Good! She's quite busy today with errands, that and raising a bunch of little larvae and a husband to boot!\" Her father apparently was in a good mood. \"I'd deliver them myself, but we're needed at the court! The swallow told us we're needed for a banquet!\" \"You mean…you're cooking ALL the food?\" She was surprised. They were just restaurant chefs and waiters! She was utterly flabbergasted at all this excitement. That would explain way mother was whistling this morning… \"Isn't that marvelous? We'll be head chefs! We'll be back tomorrow my dear!\" Her father leaped up, quite easily since he was after all a cricket, and kissed her cheek and pushed her along. \"We're packing very soon! It'll be a day to remember! Next time you'll come too! Oooh…the FAIRIES!!\" He father bounded off into the kitchen to finish the morning's backing. Calliope sighed. How she wished she could be helping her father and mother as head-chefs of that banquet…she always felt happy in the Vale…She wished she could live there! Now it was her chance to run the shop while they were gone till tomorrow. At least she would have some peace and quiet! \"But first…the errand!\" She giggled as she eagerly ran down the cobblestone, glancing back at her parents working in the kitchen. She skipped happily along, passing cottages and homes. Her disappointment that she wasn't coming along to help with the fairies was soon replaced with joy. Rarely did she have a chance to do something on her own. The entire world seemed happy. Bugs waved her, children skipped alongside her as she went down the road going towards Mrs. Juliana's house. A shadow flew over her head. Looking up, it was none other than Jacquimo! \"Calliope! What a beautiful morning!\" The swallow sang as he circled above her. She waved back. She liked talking to the swallow. He traveled around the whole place and often visited the fairies and she. The young bugs that trailed besides her waved and giggled as the eccentric swallow landed besides her. \"Indeed! I hope you'll be staying for awhile. My parents are going to be head of the food at the banquet.\" Calliope blushed as the swallow smiled. \"Oh yes! I love food! I cannot wait either! Oh what a lovely day my dear! Oh, where are you going?\" Jacquimo asked pleasantly enough as he sniffed in the basket. \"Delivery to Mrs. Juliana's. I'll be keep shop till mom and dad comes home tomorrow.\" Calliope smiled and move the basket away from the swallow's prying mouth. She knew how much the swallow loved the pies and the noodles her mother made. The little bugs giggled. \"Sorry dear! I'd best be off! I'm visiting the princess! I bid you good tidings on your journey to the ladybug! So much of the world to see!\" The swallow, always happy and smiling flew off. She started after him, wishing that perhaps she could have the endurance to fly long distances, to see the world as he did… \"You'd better go home. I have to fly the rest of the way and you won't be able to catch up!\" She bent down to the children. The little bugs frowned, waving goodbye as the buzzed away. Holding unto her basket, she leaped into the air with her powerful legs and began the steady flight towards Mrs. Juliana's home near the great tree. Unbeknownst to her was the bored beetle in the grass… \"It's hopeless!\" Berkeley cried out. Pulling off a piece of a small blade of grass, he proceeded to vent his rage on stomping it into the ground with his spats. \"NOT. FAIR!\" He didn't care if he was going mad. After all, he was sober. He only got drunk in the evenings. He was just taking a bout of fresh air wishing someone was near and to stop him from murdering plants under his bugsy shoes. And that's when he heard buzzing. Not many insects flew over the grass patch on the hill. After all, he owned a seedy nightclub in the tree on the hill, and his customers were mostly flying in the night. However… He clambered on top of a fallen rotting branch, standing tall above the grass line to see a cricket flying leisurely towards him. And it was a beautiful cricket. Something snapped his heart string. A strange plucker pulled some nerves in his brain. Indeed, he quivered with a strange excitement as he saw, flying, a young lady cricket with strong wings and an innocent expression on her face. As she was flying closer, he knew that something…something in the way her wings flashed gold in the sun, her little dress, her shapely limbs and strong legs…that she was a dancer, and young, and curvy. \"That's it…\" He purred as he climbed up on a high branch limb. \"She's the one!\" She was flying closer…and closer… My wings…my wings! He thought gleefully as his body felt refreshed and renewed, as he felt like his old self. No more was there the face of a fairy in his head. Instead there was a beautiful cricket with long curling antenna about to fly above him! He pounced. Calliope screamed as she looked as saw a beetle grappling her leg. To her, it at first seemed monstrous, like it was a demon but it was just the beetle's large nose. She was still flying, zigzagging in the air as she tried shaking off the laughing smiling mustached beetle from her leg but the spindly man held on. In fact, he seemed to enjoy himself with the view that he had up her legs… \"LET ME GO!\" She cried and started her ferocious kicking. The beetle cried out and hung on tight…only to guide the cricket lady against a stump and land on the top of a cushy toadstool. It was a few seconds, perhaps less than ten, for Mr. Beetle to shake his head and get up. He soon discovered his nose was almost in her cleavage, his arms sprawled out as he had crashed on her. Smirking, he got up and looked at the crashed cricket underneath him who was recovering from flying into a stump and then bouncing flat on a fungus. \"Mmm…very nice…\" He licked his lips as he stroked her wings, watching them twitch under his gloves. Then, she suddenly woke up, stopping his hand's advances on her face. \"Wha…uh…\" Calliope was not happy at the beetle, with devious eyes, a mustache, wild clothes and a very untrustworthy air about him that was lying on her person. \"Why, are you hurt toots?\" The thing inquired with a toothy smile. \"No! Now get off!\" She frowned and watched him chuckle with his odd voice. Thankfully he got off her and stood up to his full height, dusting himself off and offering her his hand. She refused, angry at the clever looking beetle that he pounced, grabbed her legs and hung on for dear life and made her crash. She got up and started to fix up her dress. \"So, what do you want? If it's the bread I have help yourself! I have no money!\" She eyed him and unsheathed her wings. Again Mr. Beetle eyed the golden wings, then turned his attention to the buxom lady he had caught. \"Bread? No, not bread, you! I can tell you're a dancer! And a flier too…which is very important to my case, lady!\" He laughed and leaned against the stump, peering her over with his attentive eyes. \"I'm already a baker sir!\" She blushed as he mentioned, and knew, she was a dancer. However her blushing made him smile even more. And it wasn't a happy smile either. \"Well, you can supplement your income!\" The beetle scurried over to her side, his movement erratic and slinky as he swarmed around her quite close. \"You see dear, I'm Mr. Berkeley Beetle, at your service, and owner of an exquisite venue the Beetle Ballroom!\" She had heard the name before. She heard it was a nightclub, and not a right place for a young lady to be unless she wanted to get drunk, dance and cavort with the wild life of adult bugs. The idea of dancing for this perverted beetle in a place like that was unheard of! Especially when he attacked her! \"No thanks. I'm fine just the way I am…now if you excuse me…\" She turned to leave but his long fingers had grasped her arms and pulled her back. \"You're making a big mistake toots. Think of your family, your friends…think of all the pretty clothing you can wear, think of the energy you would feel!\" He said in her ear. \"And think of me, all lonesome, and deprived of the company of a beautiful girl like you…\" She had little time to react as he started smooching up her arm, planting big fat kisses and mumbling the words 'gorgeous', 'delicious', 'sexy' and 'mind-numbing'. Blushing again as she tried to get away he pulled her into his embrace, kissing her bare shoulders and neck madly. She had never experienced that kind of behavior before. \"Sir…please…you don't even know me!\" Calliope was not very happy about continuously blushing at the barrage of strange sensations on her neck, nor how he was maneuvering her around to be pinned to the side of the stump. \"Oh I know you want to come…you dance beautifully I'm sure…you don't want to waste that talent…\" He cooed and surprisingly gentle despite his odd scratchy voice. She couldn't help but shiver at the vibration of his voice against the crook of her neck. It was all that he needed to move into her line of view, looking into her eyes with his lustful smirk on his face. She stared back. Then he kissed her. Any thoughts on liking this man quickly vanished. She squealed and squirmed as she tasted alcohol and blue lips. It's not something to get used to when someone kisses you, especially so suddenly and hard. He felt him chewing her lips as she thought, THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. \"Let…me…GO!\" She screamed as he pulled away for breath and began attacking her face with his lips. He took no heed, holding her tighter against him as she struggled to get away. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" Cried Mrs. Juliana. \"Oh GOD.\" Calliope moaned out as Mr. Beetle, startled and letting out a squeak, unhanded his precious cargo to look behind him. There was the ladybug herself, well fed and angry ready to hit him with an umbrella. She did not approve of seeing a low-life insect fellow like him taking advantage of a young cricket, especially one she knew like a daughter! \"Sorry madam!\" Mr. Beetle was wise in stepping away from the pretty lady he smooched. The ladybug eyed him, and though she was an old woman she was quite strong in walloping sleaze-balls like him. \"Oh! Thank you, thank you!\" Calliope hopped over behind her and eyed the now-known dangerous beetle warily. \"Now you…you fiend! Back off and fly back to your home!\" Mrs. Juliana waved the umbrella at him. He stood and smiled, fiddling with his mustache as he chuckled under his breath. \"You'll look over my offer toots, will ya? Drop in anytime, it's at the top of the tree!\" The beetle blew her a kiss before he laughed and leaped of the mushroom. Calliope instantly looked up towards the tree on the hill. There was indeed a cavern, a hole that was lit inside. Sighing, she relaxed unto the ladybug's shoulders, feeling tired after the attack. Mrs. Juliana set about to help her fix her dress and otherwise worry about what had happened. All she saw was flying in the air, watching a beetle kissing the squealing and squirming Calliope. \"Are you alright? What did that fiend do to you? How DARE he…and you, friends with the fairies!\" The ladybug of course was very frustrated and flustered at the seemingly impossible way the beetle had flustered and blustered her ward. \"I don't even think he knew I was with the fairies…if he knew, he surely wouldn't have done that to me!\" Calliope was frustrated and flustered as she very well should be after an attack like that. She shook her head and sighed again, thinking about how strange and…warm…it felt when he had kissed her. As she looked at the entrance to the Beetle Ballroom at the top of the tree, she felt that perhaps…perhaps she could go there. She was an only child after all, and where else could she dance? Only in her room and with the fairies! And even then it was courtesy, for no fairy would wish to love a lowly cricket like her. Perhaps he is right. I should enjoy life more! Even if he was being perverted, he had one good intention. I'll go tonight! She was sure that no one there would let that rascal beetle get near her. She picked up the basket and handed it to the still talking ladybug, and she kissed Calliope on the nose and flew off her merry way. Sighing, Calliope smiled at anticipating a trip without her parents! \"I'm not as gullible as it may seem, Mr. Beetle!\" She giggled and began her flight back to her home to work for the rest of the day. A/N: Read and review my friends! The adventures of Shoys-writing-another-childhood-movie-fanfic. Now, when AM I going to move on to writing another dark, violent, serious masterpiece? I don't know. But I will eventually, I already have some plans…For now, read my charming happy little story right here! Shoys.[Chapter 3] A/N: TANGO TIME! The twilight commencing, Calliope dressed in her yellow ball gown, glittering with fairy dust sewn into the threads and ribbons. She placed a flower brooch at the base of one of her antenna, and, picking up her purse, locked up the bakery to set out on an adventure. The whole idea of setting out, by herself, into the unknown was new to her. She didn't know what to expect from this nightclub, whatever it means, but she was sure it was going to be fun! All the fun she ever had was constantly baking, cooking, and selling goods with her loving mother and father, not to mention sightseeing the Vale. As she flew in the air just after sunset towards the tree on the hill, she began thinking. Thinking how the fairies treated her and her family, how things were, and everything else. Meeting that beetle had certainly made her feel…well, shy, insulated, and missing out on more glories of the night that she could participate in. She soon felt; well, a bit sad that she was lonely. She felt she was missing something, something fun and wild. The way the beetle certainly behaved, his clothes, and in fact that he expressed a confusing interest in her she never saw nor felt the likes before was exciting her. Exciting her to go past her better judgment and fly to the establishment to see what was there. In the failing light she saw the lights and heard the sounds of a band playing. There, the entrance was glittering and dazzling muted blue light, and as she landed delicately she was peered inside. There, in the midst of the tree was the crystal entrance, glittering with blues and greens and yellow neon as insects and arachnids dressed in suits and dresses milled in. As she walked in, looking at the lights and feeling the sound of the dancing beat shake her exoskeleton inside, she was truly marveled. The lights and sounds was definitely different than what the fairies had! It was blaring, loud, and made you feel immediately like dancing. She saw the dance floor littered with couples. They were shaking their feet, dancing and hopping as the band blasted away the music. Her foot was tapping without her even knowing it. The whole place was alive with singing and dancing. Some were off the sides, drinking and dining and doing their own business…including Mr. Beetle. Currently he was sipping some Elderberry wine in the corner, waiting to see if she was really going to come. It was hard to see particular individuals in the throng of dancers in his nightclub, but he knew he was determined to spy with his big eyes a beautiful cricket, golden wings and gullible will. And there he saw her, shyly dancing in a sparkling gold dress in the midst. There was a fat other beetle that soon got in the swing with her, as she giggled and danced with the old geezer. \"There she is…\" He snickered as he primped his mustache and got up, slinking through the crowd towards her. His happiness was assured as he felt that indeed, she was an obvious gullible lady to take advantage of. And she was FAR prettier than Thumbelina in that dress! Calliope hoped that the crowd might hide her from that nasty beetle but unfortunately the fat one that was dancing with her was rudely shoved aside by, you guessed it, Mr. Berkeley Beetle. Tipping his top hat to her, laughing like a villain, and with a face and smile so devious, she almost stopped dancing to turn around a run. However the crowd had formed a bubble around her that no one could pass through the throng of bodies and Calliope was unfortunately dancing and frowning, seeing herself trapped. \"Let's dance baby!\" He snickered as he started to, well, tap dance. Calliope was utterly transfixed at his legs and shiny spats clicking away, swinging his cane and showing off his dancing prowess. Soon she was hardly moving, shyly blushing as she underestimated that his perverted behavior and the title of managing a nightclub…made it seem unlikely he also danced in the nightclub. Smirking as he grasped her wrist, she squeaked as she twirled her around like a ballerina, and as he made her reluctantly made her boogie and do the Jitterbug, he was assessing her abilities. For one, he noticed, she was graceful on her feet and balance, revealing that she had dance lessons. Already he had a ballroom act and a ballet planned. Second, she was soon catching on to the rambunctious moves of boogying, Jitterbugging, and soon he planned to shows her the Charleston, the Mashed Potato, the Mexican Hat Dance and other styles of Latin beats and groove. He could tell she was adept at ballroom. He couldn't wait to tango with her. And third, she was not too strong in her arm strength and in her sense of the present, which made it all the more easier to keep a grip on her body and make sure she didn't run out of his arms every time he pressed against her body in lewd dance moves. Calliope was more in a state of shock as they danced lively and…closely. His nose kept getting in her face, his laughter and his strength keeping her from getting away from her unwilling partner. She kept trying to look at him and show how afraid and unhappy she was, but she soon realized that as they did strange dance moves she wasn't accustomed too, that he actually seemed happier when she resisted him. Soon, the song ended, Mr. Beetle holding her close crushed against him as he smiled and clapped with the masses. Calliope was almost breathless after hopping, swinging, and wildly stepping with her dancer-captor and hoped he would let her go. She summoned up her courage and glared at him, the crowd dispersing as the music turned to soft lounge jazz. \"You dance sweet toots. You've got talent no dame ever had.\" He smiled deviously as he fixed his tight clothes from dancing, and started to pull her over to his favorite table. \"Wanna drink?\" She was gasping, her dress a bit lopsided, her antenna about the place as she struggled to get her footing and respond with a 'no', but Mr. Beetle's gang had already seated her and poured her a glass of wine. She was plopped down in a seat and an enticing glass was in front of her, with Mr. Beetle sipping and posing in his seat looking at her. She gulped and felt even more nervous from the five white dressed beetles hovering over her. \"So, sweetie, how would you like to earn some dough?\" He got right to business with her, not even minding he still didn't know her name. \"Sir, I don't know who you think you are, dancing and grabbing me from the air, but I'm perfectly fine with my baking business!\" She pushed the drink aside, wishing the other beetles weren't there blocking her from getting out of the chair. \"Listen, I'm sorry if I scared you earlier, but I had to get to know you!\" He polished the drink off in one gulp. \"You are the best dancer I've ever met! You have talent baby, talent! You don't want to waste it. I 'attacked' you for a reason, because I couldn't let you waste your talent on just making cookies.\" He leaned over to her, his eyes narrowing. \"Work for me…and your entire family and yourself will be rich not just in wealth but in spirit. You can't keep cooking all your life.\" Calliope was speechless, staring at him as she weighted the possibilities. For one, if she worked for him he could stop pestering her. Besides what did he have in mind for dancing? \"What do you want me to do?\" \"I have two dance numbers already planned with just you, and one with me in it! You'll have costumes, rehearsals, dancers and sets and what ever you want! You'll be the toast of the land! And you…\" His hand went under her china and lifted her head up to look at him. \"…are the most beautiful girl in the world.\" Calliope blushed. \"So what do you say? You see how this place hops and grooves, how popular it is, and how I'm willing to let someone like you take center stage.\" She looked around at the place, how wild and wonderful the place was. \"So do me the honor, please, will you participate in this wonderful place?\" He let go of her chin, and, removing his attention from peering down her dress front he sat back as the light dimmed, to start the perfect show-stopper to fully grasp the cricket's attention. \"Ladies and gentlebugs!\" The MC voice boomed as everyone sat down, the stage darkening and the band shutting up. \"The Beetle Ballroom presents to you…Golden Blossoms, a new play in one act!\" Immediately the band struck up the tune, a tune that was exotic and definitely Asian themed. The stage lit up with yellow lights, portraying bugs in Asian costume, the sound of gongs, and exotic dancing. There were assorted bugs doing choreographed moves, men and women, with flowers and plants around as they swayed to the music and danced in their fine glittering clothing. Calliope was staring, looking at the mesmerizing lights and sound almost echoing that of her parent's homeland. Here antenna quivered as she heard and saw everything. \"I thought this year I would try a little oriental theme…how does it?\" He said. \"Very well…very well indeed! The whole show is just magical! Almost like fairy dust!\" Calliope said as she continued to watch, just as Mr. Beetle wanted her to. The entire act involved a geisha cricket garbed in gold that had attracted the attentions of a samurai rumored to be so ugly and fearsome, he always wore a terrifying blue mask. The geisha would not be with the likes of him as her father pressured for her to marry him, and she was so afraid of his hulking form and countenance she finally ran away from him. She thought he didn't love her and only wanted her father's lands. But, in reality, the samurai was actually powerful and strong but he was not as big and his face wasn't ugly. In fact he really loved her, but to keep up with the claims he was mean and nasty he had to lie in public. Eventually he had to run after her, and he finally caught her and showed her the truth. Then they did a dance number for the wedding. It was a charming musical number that had the entire crowd applauding. Even Calliope clapped. \"Well? How would you like to star in that little number?\" Mr. Beetle scooted his chair next to hers. \"Well I could dance much better than she!\" She exclaimed with her dazed excitement. \"What it needs…is you. Say you'll do it! Dance and make magic!\" He hissed. Calliope turned to face him, biting her lip as she looked him over. \"Allow me to…convince you.\" With that, he leaped over, pulled her out of the chair with a spin, grabbed a red rose, stuck it betwixt his teeth and proceeded to tango her under the spotlight. The entire crowd oohed and ahhed, watching the two tango. They did not however know that this was not an act that was planned…well, actually it was planned but Calliope didn't know of it. Therefore Calliope was against thrust into a dance she had some formal training of…and she was not too glad having him lead her in a dance that was involving her body around him, sliding and rubbing and slinking and twisting and being in close quarters with his breath in her ear… Not to mention she was disturbed at the sensuous tones of the dance. He was enjoying himself, dancing with this fine specimen, the thrill of having a woman in his arms to lightly stroke and touch satisfied his craving for now. Calliope was trying not to enjoy this, but doing such a wild vivacious dance was hard to do, and so she had to concentrate on moving the steps instead of worrying about how sexually harassing his hands were to her person. With a twirl and she leaned back almost touching the floor, the tango ended with loud applause, Mr. Beetle savoring the moment of looking into her exposed cleavage before he pulled her back into an embrace. Both were panting heavily, looking in each other's eyes… \"Work for me?\" He whispered. \"Y-yes…\" She gasped, and then he smooched her before taking the rose out of his teeth and handed it to her. He soon disappeared into the darkness of the clapping crowd, and she drifted away, in a daze of exhaustion and shock as she lazily flew away, looking forward to bed with visions of dancing crickets and beetles in her head. While he stood watching her departure, a smirk on his face. A/N: Dum de dum dum! Perverted plans into ACTION! R&R;! Shoys.[Chapter 4] A/N: You know, Inthought I would keep this whole fic short…but now, we have TWOnperverts. One's classy, ones immature. Read on! Busy and bustlingnalong, Mr. And Mrs. Chang were busy and more busy in the kitchens ofnthe fairy court. The entire place was big and full, filled withnfairies and assorted other bugs that were baking, stirring, cooking,nchopping, boiling, basting, broiling, mixing, icing, thawing andnshredding food. Mr. Chang was at the dinner breads, overseeing thenchefs and adding in the right spices and yeast. Dinner would benserved in a half hour, and most of the bread was done. Now he wasnadmiring the freezer, a strange wooden box kept cold with blue fairynfrost. Breaking his gaze from inside, he began personally sprinklingncinnamon on the flan with the others. On another long gleaming tablenthere were fairies mixing ice cream, and behind him at another tablenthe last of the giant batter batch of garlic bread sticks was beingnrolled. At the other end of the kitchen, there were vats of soup andnstew, ovens filled with cooking delectables, pans frying choicenvegetables, and Mrs. Chang herself was pulling out stuffed pumpkinnseeds. The fairies you see were strictly vegetarian, and no meat wasnserved at all. However Mrs. Chang was eager to compensate, and hadnjust taken over a stir fry of imported tofu, greens and carrots. Shenhoped that the fairies would enjoy some oriental cuisine from hernancestor's homeland. Breathlessly they soonnwatched the fairy pages take out the prepared appetizers. The Changsngathered to peer out the kitchen door to see a massive banquet, linednwith golden and glowing fairy nobles. At the head of the table as thenking and queen, and besides them were the notable prince and the mostnbeautiful in the land, Princess Thumbelina. \"She is so beautifulnto wear the white crown…\" Mrs. Chang remarked. \"And to think shenwas once wingless, and amongst us! She is truly a friend of our kind,ndon't you think?\" He giggled to his wife. \"And her wings glownlike our daughters'…\" Indeed, it wasnThumbelina herself who gave singing lessons to Calliope, but Calliopenwas more adept at dancing. Since Thumbelina's inauguration asnprincess, Thumbelina was soon learning all sorts of things and wasnsoon learning how to act more and more regal. But she was the samensweet, loving fairy and tried to spend as much time as she could withninsect visitors, however little she could afford. The duties of thenkitchen called them, and the Changs soon retreated back into thendepths of the kitchens to keep on the cooking for the feast. They allncertainly hoped that their daughter wasn't getting into anyntrouble… Yes, she wasn't inntrouble…yet. She was busy, bus,nbusy! This new day she was in charge of all the cooking and thenbaking. Thankfully the community knew that her parents were out ofntown, so they mostly laid off. However the children bugs flocked in,nbegging for candies and pastries. The bakery part was filled with nheat as she and a few of the assistances were baking cakes, bread,ncandies, and other sweets. The aroma of the whole place was that ofncinnamon, sugar, honey, cookie dough and warm flaky crust. \"Alright then, herenyou go!\" Calliope quickly handed a wrapped package of assortedncookies and lollipops to the waiting arms of a group of jitteringnyoung bugs, and she slumped in the cashier's seat. With hernhandkerchief she wiped the sweat form her brow. Baking and cookingnwas such hard work without her parents! \"Need a drink?\" Looking up, she metnthe eyes of one of the assistants. His name was Waverly, a youngnhandsome wasp. He always smiled his eyes always devious and his wholenbody shone yellow and black. She knew he always polished hisnexoskeleton, and he was part of a gang that hung around with othernlike-minded adolescent boys…he was charming to her she guessed, Henwas always rather helpful but he never really was good at cooking,nmostly cleaning up and taking money. She needed a drink.n\"Thanks,\" she spoke as she took the glasses of water from him. Hensmirked his usual trickster smile and set to shake his apron,nflashing his white veined wings in front of her. \"You'renwelcome…Say…you know how long I've been here?\" Waverly said.nNo customers were around, and the other too apprentices were in thenback baking. His eyes beadily looked about the room. \"About a year. Why?\"nShe replied. Looking at him now…she suddenly felt this was all toonfamiliar with Mr. Beetle from yesterday. \"Oh, nothing. Younknow, I've been thinking…of you know…we could go out sometimento a club.\" Waverly was always annormal face to be around at the kitchens, but now that had alreadynfaced a sly, similar dilemma yesterday…his face didn't seem sonkind and innocent now. \"So what do you saynabout going to a dance club tonight? You and me? Best dresses, food,na little drink…\" \"I have a previousnengagement Waverly. Besides, why do you want me? Don't you and thengang already have some girls?\" She never liked who he hung outnwith, especially the girls with them, but she thought that perhapsnWaverly was a nicer kid. Waverly moved closer,ndetermined to charm the girl he always knew into coming with him. Shenwas always gullible, so why not now when her parents weren'tnaround? He smiled at this as he invaded her personal bubble. However he did notncount that she had changed since yesterday. Not since she met a seedyncharacter similar to Waverly yesterday. Not since she now firstndetected sexual interesting Waverly. She did not trust himnanymore. \"I'm not the girlnyou used to look at you know.\" Calliope glared at him and huggednher arms. \"I have something to go to tonight, and I don't want tonhang out with you. I don't trust your motives.\" Waverley chuckled andnleft her space, looking at her and trying his best to remain Sauvé.n\"But Calliope, I've always liked you! I would never think ofnhurting you or anything!\" \"I think you might.nI never really trusted you and that gang, and I'm already with anrelationship!\" \"You already have anboyfriend?\" The wasp was confused at her words. Oops, Calliopenthought. No, Mr. Beetle wasn't her boyfriend! But…if it would getnWaverly to leave her alone… \"Yes, I do have one.nI'm meeting him tonight, not you. Now get back to mopping!\"nCalliope lifted up her nose and stalked off back into the kitchen,nconfident that Waverly would give up. Perhaps he would leave thisnplace, since he only worked here to see her, and she couldnbecome…well, a dance star, an actress, a singer! Waverly chuckled as henwatched her leave. Now that he noticed that she wasn't, strangely,nas gullible as the past year, he could do more things in earnest tonearn her favor. Sadly, she knew she was thinking he was a wild boy.nHe was. He wanted her as his girl and she would have to deal with thenfact he wasn't goody-goody like her! No beautiful insect shouldnstay so sweet and happy with a body like hers! He would have her nonmatter what. Now he just needed to plan some more when she gets homesnfrom wherever she was going… A/N: You know, Inlove this story, because I get to write about FOOOODD!!! MMM!!!! I should draw anpicture of Waverly sometime… Shoys.[Chapter 5] A/N: After weeks ofnlaptop not working, then working, then internet class work, I givenyou another chapter at last! Enjoy my dears! \"Beautiful!nStupendous! Shake it baby shake it!\" Mr. Beetle as usualnwas standing on his director's chair, with a large megaphone,nyelling and whistling orders to the dancers as they rehearsed. \"Now toots, you seen'em right there? Wild feet baby wild feet!\" He bent down towardsnCalliope, who just walked up besides him to begin rehearsing… \"I see….well….\" Berkeley looked at hernand then he knew that he wasn't talking to a cricket. He wasntalking to a God damn beautiful angel. \"What?\" Calliopenlooked up at him with her innocent eyes, framed with glittery eyenshadow, a bit of rouge to her pale cheeks, an oriental wig withnflowers and gold, bright luscious lips, a beautiful blue dress likenthe waves of clear crystal lake in the mountains, and a large helpingnof sex appeal combined with innocent beauty and divine womanly form… \"N-nothin….uh…there'snyour cue! Go out there and show me your stuff!\" He recovered hisncomposure and fixed his dropped jaw as she hurried on stage fornrehearsal. \"Action baby!\" The rehearsal for thenlone dance number between her and the water lilies was almostnperfect. He stared, his mustache twitching as he only watched her donthe practiced moves, her legs fine and shapely and the dress perfectnfor her beautiful composure. She was dancing a bit rusty, but afternthe hour of practice and part taking, she could go on with the showntomorrow. She was a natural. Shensang like the fairies. She danced like a flower spirit. Her movementsnwere the grace of a swan. And when was learning her lines and thenmusic together only an hour before, her voice was now noticed likenthe tolling grace of a divine bell. She would be thenperfect wife. No matter he couldn't fly. No matter them all! He andnshe would be free, perfect, rich, ad filled with the ups and downs ofna lustful relationship. \"Oh baby cakes…\"nHe purred as the song drew to a close. Panting, she relaxednas the group of professional dancers relaxed after the number.nLooking up, she saw Mr. Berkeley in his director's hat standing innfront of her, his eyes wide with awe, and his whiskers trembling. \"That was wonderful!nAMAZING! You'll be the TOP BILLING!\" He shrieked with excitementnand promptly hugged her tight, squeezing her in his gracious blissnand let her go, dancing around her with ecstasy. The rest of thentroupe and stage hands present blinked and stared, never seeing himnso gaga over a lady. \"Thank you?\" Shenreplied and watched him stand, trembling and trying to maintain hisnstature as before. He coughed into his hand and looked at her,nsmiling deviously at her. Sexual thoughts ran through his head, andnthen he stifled them so they wouldn't translate into the physicalnsense. \"Thank you…so verynmuch…my darling Calliope…\" controlling himself, he couldn'tncompletely tame the beast because, after all, he was like thisnnormally. He sauntered closer to her, snaking an arm about her waist,nhis face in hers, his voice a deep purr. She blushed and beforenshe could leave, once again he kissed, but this time on the cheek. \"Listen, um, I'mnnot exactly…your girl you know…\" She began, nervously staringninto his eyes. \"Oh of course!\"nWith deft precision his hand moved from her as light as a feather,nand before she could even register her senses he had backed off andnthus was the cue for the stage hands to stop watching. \"Tomorrow, be readnfor the play my dear. It is time to retire.\" He spoke to her, thennraised his voice to the actors and dancers. The bugs buzzed off tonundress and get back home, for it was late at night and all was busy. She turned to leavenand change, but Mr. Beetle had grasped her wrist, holding her back. \"Not yet my sweet.\"nHis voice…seemed changed to her for a moment. \"I just want tonsay…thank you for your time, thank you for being a apart of this,nand thank you for gracing us with your presence. See you tomorrowntoots.\" With that eloquentnspeech he ran off into the darkness after kissing her hand, and fornonce she smiled for him. But still feeling very untrustworthy of hisncharacter. \"This is way betternthan cooking.\" She whispered. A/N: Last chapter Inpromised to draw Waverly. I didn't. LOL. I really like thisnstory.

Hope you like it. I don't imagine this fandom has a lot of readers so please review. The Becky O'Shea list of the Day If you want to stop liking someone here is the easiest way, have your dad and their mother start dating and living together and have to share a bathroom with them. A little complicated for you? It's how I got over my crush on my soon to be step brother Junior. There is nothing like living with someone to bring all their faults glaringly to light. Top Ten reason's I don't have a crush on Junior anymore 10) He always uses the last of the milk. It's not just once or twice either but every carton, so at least once a week or so I'm sitting across the kitchen table from him eating dry cereal. 9) The phone rings all the time now and its always for him. I think I would die of shock if the phone wasn't for him. It's always some cute girl from school calling to either moon over him or listen to him say hello and hang up, those are the worst. 8) He spends more time in the bathroom than any boy ever should. He takes more time in there than the rest of the house combined. And on top of that he always beats me to the bathroom in the morning, I swear he must wait for me to get up because pretty much the first thing I see is his smiling face slamming the bathroom door in my face. With him always in the bathroom first and forever you'd think that he wouldn't always get the last of the milk but he does. 7) He leaves the toilet seat up. This may seem like an over reaction but tell that to me after you fall into the cold water in the middle of the night. Seriously does the seat weigh a million pounds? 6) I must have at least ten girls at our school trying to be friends with me so that they can sneak into his room and steal something. It is seriously putting a strain on my friendships with girls. Not that I have a lot of them so you can understand why this added strain is a bit much for me, I'm starting to think I'll never have a best girlfriend... the closest I have is Debbie and I mean she's related to me. 5) After the summer we were all in pee wee football together Junior made friends with Murphy, Briggs and Patterson. I played with them too and while they are fun and great to play football with I don't really care for having them in my house. They are messy and love messing with me. They are always hanging out in Juniors room and frankly the walls are thin and I do not need to know about Patterson's intense love for Susan Wilkinson. I've never been able to look at her the same way. 4) Speaking of thin walls not only do I know way more about the shape of Susan Wilkinson's...well everything then anyone should ever know I also haven't had a proper full nights sleep in far too long. Junior needs music to get to sleep. I very much do not. I have to wait until I hear his god awful snoring sneak into his room and turn off the radio before I can get to sleep. 3) As you may have been able to guess he's very popular with the ladies. Which unfortunately means I have seen almost everyone of Junior's many girlfriends in various states of undress. 2) Spike Hammersmith. You may be wondering what he has to do with me no longer having romantic feelings for Junior. It's not what you're thinking. Rather it seems that Junior and he have instead of growing closer like he had with Murphy, Briggs and Patterson they have developed some sort of weird rivalry. When we started living together he apparently took up my rivalry with Spike. I'm not sure how but this gesture pretty much solidified a new platonic feeling for the tall blonde. 1) The number one reason that I got over my crush on Junior is that our parents got married or at least are about to get married in a couple of weeks and we have been living in the same house for five years. Yeah they were pretty slow on the whole making it official in the eyes of the law thing. What can I say, he's my brother and for five years I have been living with his milk stealing, bathroom hogging, grudge sharing boy and slowly all the awkward I'm in love with my sort of step brother feelings have disappeared and living in my heart instead is a sisterly protect you to the end of my life, let you use my homework, cover for you when you sneak out love. \"Icebox.\" Looking up I can see Patterson in the hallway standing slightly away from the door frame as if he expects me to rush him. Quirking an eyebrow and sitting up on my bed I close my Physics textbook and focus on the tall lanky boy, \"What?\" \"You know the start of term get to know you dance...\" Peterson is twitching and the nervousness is kind of memorizing. Drawn to the sudden shyness of the normally brash boy, I lean causally against the door frame waiting for this conversation to go somewhere that makes some sort of sense. His nervousness would make sense if he was asking me to go with him to the dance but that is impossible. Not only because of his incredible love of Susan Wilkinson but because we barely tolerate each others existence beyond the football field. Personally I don't really care about him, he's Junior's friend and that's all. \"I know of it...\" I push hair out of my face studying him. His bright blue eyes are darting around the room as if he's worried about getting caught. \"Did you know if...\" \"Susan has a date?\" I smirk at the shocked look on his face. \"How?\" I knock on the wall and the sound is loud and echoing in the hallway, \"old house, thin walls.\" I pause to take in his sufficiently embarrassed face, \"No she doesn't Billy. Ask her soon, I'm sure you're not the only one to notice her perfect...assets...\" I can hear Patterson swallow a lump in his throat, \"Thanks Icebox...ummm good luck.\" \"With what?\" He's already moving down the hall to Junior's room, \"getting a date.\" He says it with such pity I want to call Debbie and tell her to warn Susan away from him. But somehow I know that he's being sincere. Painfully sincere and filled with pity for the girl that all the boys in school are afraid of. Well almost all the boys but I didn't want to go there. I was lying on the floor beside my bed the last of the free summer air drifting over me from the open window. I could hear Junior and Peterson talking excitedly about the dance and which girls would be the best choices. It was mostly a once sided topic because Billy was madly in teenage love with Susan and swore if he couldn't go with her he wouldn't go. It was mostly Junior who was having a hard time deciding who to go with. He was the most sought after boy in their grade and the grades below for that fact. The senior girls however seemed to prefer Spike. It was a weird bad boy thing I think. He looked a little James Dean, he had a rebel without a cause, devil may care attitude with a slender but solid build. The only thing he seemed to give a shit about was football and I couldn't help but respect him for that. This was the first year I wasn't going to be playing football with him and I was a little disappointed. I had both my arms broken last season, not at the same time but still I had had a hard enough time convincing dad and Patty to let me play after the first broken arm that after the second there was no way it was happening. So this year instead of pushing me to be better he would just be pushing my buttons. I could see the blue and silver of my old lettermans jacket hanging on the chair on the otherside of the bed. I could hear excited girlish chatter and it pulled my attention away from the now sad silver and blue. \"Oh my god you will not believe what I just heard!\" Looking upside down towards the open doorway I saw pink kitten heels and soft tanned legs. Pulling my eyes up soft looking blonde hair and bright eyes and an excited pretty face. Debbie O'Shea. Sighing I sat up, \"What?\" I was waiting for her favourite topic to come streaming out of her mouth, boys and the gossip that surrounded them. Debbie flounced into the room and sat down on the floor next to me. She was smiling in a way that I knew that this news would be different, \"I just heard that Coach Foster? You know the Football couch,\" She added like I hadn't been playing ball for him for two years already, \"He's looking for a student assistant. I was there for practice when he was talking to Coach Miller. I almost fell off the pyramid to tell him that it should be you!\" \"Oh my god!\" There are very few occasions were I have jumped up and down with excitement, when we won the game against the cowboys five years ago, when I got kissed by Brad Shakemen in junior high and now. I stood up so quickly that I felt a little dizzy, \"what did he say?\" Debbie jumped up elegantly and I felt a twinge of jealousy fly quickly through my body, \" He said make sure she's here for try outs next Thursday!\" \"Oh my god! I love you!\" I grabbed her hands and we jumped up and down in a circle until Patty came rushing upstairs to make sure we were okay. \"Becky? Debbie? Is everything alright?\" She still had yellow rubber gloves on and she was dripping sudsy water onto the floor. \"Becky's going to be assisting Coach Foster this season!\" Debbie squealed excitedly. \"Icebox?\" Behind Patty Peterson and Junior had appeared. \"I get to help the team after all!\" I couldn't stop smiling. \"That's great!\" Junior smiled. \"I thought she got a date for the dance.\" Peterson's words were quiet but they rang in my ears and the smile that Debbie had put there dropped.[Chapter 2] A/N: So this is my first real attempt at a first person narrative. I hope it's okay. I haven't gotten any feedback for this at all yet. I'm going to soldier on at least until there is some Spike action because mainly I'm writing this for myself. The Becky O'Shea List of the day \"What's he talking about date?\" Debbie asked when the hall had emptied. I had been silly to think that Debbie wouldn't catch what Billy had said. Her ears where tuned into hearing that kind of thing. \"The get to know you dance.\" I sighed pushing hair away from my eyes avoiding her gaze. \"So? You don't have a date?\" She closed the open door keeping her voice quiet keeping this conversation from the rest of the house. \"No.\" my voice hitched and I hated myself a little bit. I threw myself onto the bed a long heavy sigh escaping, \"And I won't get one.\" Debbie was standing at the end of the bed arms crossed, stance wide. Somehow challenging. It was times like this that she really reminded me of Uncle Kevin. \"Of course you will. You are an O'Shea, we get what we want.\" Her voice was quiet and firm and strong and her determination unwavering. She sat on the bed next to me and smiling she poked me in the side, \"So, which boy do you want?\" I shrugged, \"I hadn't really thought of it...\" \"This could be a problem.\" She was quiet for a couple of minutes before she sprung up off of the bed, \"You're going to Macy's party tonight.\" \"I am?\" \"You sure are. Be at my house after dinner we'll go together.\" \"I don't understand how will this get me a date?\" \"Oh leave that to me.\" Debbie flounced happily out of the room just as excited as she had been when she had gotten here. \"So what are you two doing on the last night of Summer vacation?\" Dad smiled as he handed the pitcher of iced tea to Junior. \"I'm going to Macy's party tonight.\" \"Oh me too.\" I was a little taken aback at how surprised he seemed. \"You are?\" \"Hey it's not like I've never been to a party before.\" \"Yeah but usually you go with the team and only after like twenty minutes of being badgered. So who talked you into it this time?\" I looked away from his smug face, \"Debbie.\" Debbie's room hadn't changed much in five years, still incredibly girly, pink and frilly. White furniture and pretty glass bottles shining in the failing summer light. \"You don't look too bad.\" She smiled taking in my appearance. She spun me around and I felt off balance for more than one reason. She was really looking at me, evaluating me and I didn't like it. I knew that tonight was going to be a long night so I had worn jeans and sneakers. I wore a blue peasant blouse that Debbie had given me a couple of Christmas's ago. Something I knew she wouldn't have a problem with if I wore. \"You just had to wear this didn't you.\" She sighed pulling at my letterman's jacket. \"Why wouldn't I? It'll be cold when we leave the party.\" \"Oh Becky, Becky, Becky. Don't you understand what tonight is?\" \"A party?\" \"Oh sweet innocent Becky.\" She shook her head and pulled the jacket off of me, \"These are the colors of being taken. This symbolizes not only that you have a boyfriend but a boyfriend that will beat the shit out of any boy who tries to talk to you. This is the party when we find out which boys like you so obviously this has to go.\" \"That's a lot for a jacket to say...\" I shivered. I had grown accustom to the warmth and protection the jacket had provided. I wasn't sure if I was ready to see which boys liked me, I wasn't sure I wanted to know. I had a feeling I wasn't going to be very pleased with the results. \"Yeah well it does.\" She threw the jacket onto the bed and started pacing around the room, \"At least your hair is down. You look so cute with your hair down.\" \"Umm thanks?\" I chose not to tell her that Patty had done my hair. She had walked by when I had thrown my hairbrush across the room and she had come to my rescue. \"Wear this instead.\" She threw a thin black cardigan at me. I caught it easily even thou the toss was high and to the right. I put it on and let her spin me around again. \"That'll do.\" she smiled happily and grabbed my arm, \"Let's go find you a boy.\" there was a finality in her words that made me nervous but also excited. Having a boyfriend would fill up the time I usually dedicated to practising football with the guys. Maybe I would even have a proper date to Dad and Patty's wedding. Susan Wilkinson was waiting downstairs. She was smiling brightly and was laughing a little as Debbie pulled me down the stairs, \"I didn't think I'd ever see you out of that blue and silver.\" her voice was sweet and her face was kind. I could understand why Patterson was so infatuated with her. She was pretty and a good person. \"It almost didn't happen, someone had brought their security blanket.\" \"Did you really think you'd get away with your lettermen's jacket?\" She asked opening the front door and making her way to the beaten up car she had inherited from her brother. \"Yes...\" I mumbled getting into the back seat of the rusted car. I didn't really see the point in driving to Macy Abbot's house when we live in a pretty compact town. Perhaps it was a fast get away thing in case the party got raided. The ride over was of course incredibly short, long enough for Debbie and Susan to sing to some catchy pop song on the radio. It was only 9:00 and the house was thumping. The sound of pop music and teenage chatter spilled out onto the street. \"Come on.\" Susan grabbed a hold of my arm and pulled me towards the house, \"I hear were looking for you're soul mate.\" I would have been mad at Debbie if Susan hadn't of been the most trustworthy person I had ever met. The house was hot and filled with what looked like 90 percent of the high school. I tried to follow Susan into the house but she quickly disappeared. A panicked nervousness flooded my body. I had never been alone at a party in my entire life. All through out Junior High and so far all of High School I had been surrounded by my teammates and friends or at the very least Junior. \"Debbie?\" I turned around to see her bright blonde hair disappear down the hall. I let the crowd surge and push me further into the house. Apparently she was leaving me to find a boy on my own. I racked my brain trying to think of what Debbie would want me to do. All I could think of was my thirst, so I made my way to the kitchen. Macy Abbot was leaning happily against the kitchen counter talking to a blond boy I would have known in my sleep, \"Hey Macy, Junior.\" I nodded on my way past them towards the fridge. \"Hey Icebox...\" Macy's smile faltered, \"Or should I call you Becky now?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Junior turned around and reached his hand out to grab a hold of my shirt, \"What are you wearing?\" \"It's called a shirt?\" \"You look like a girl.\" I rolled my eyes, \"Nice eye...I'll see you later.\" I shook my head lightly and brushed past them. Opening the fridge I noticed that Macy had done a good job at removing anything that she didn't want eaten, I doubted her fridge usually contained only beer and water. I picked up a bottle of water looked at it a moment and then put it back. I didn't have to worry about practice or training anymore, I picked up a bottle of beer and exited the kitchen. The living room was thumping with music and people and seemed like a good place to disappear into the crowd. I leaned against the wall and looked at the bottle. I had picked a bottle that didn't twist, of course. Looking around to see if there was a bottle opener around I didn't notice him slide up next to me until suddenly the bottle was no longer in my hands. \"Isn't this beverage a little adult for you Icebox?\" the voice was strong and dark and I sighed. \"Just give it back Spike.\" I turned and saw Spike. Tall, lean, dark and smug. His skin looked paler against the black of his hair. It hung just long enough for him to be able to shake it out of his dark eyes. He held the bottle close to me but as I tried to retrieve it he pulled it away. \"How are you going to open it?\" His face was smug and I already missed hitting him and pushing him into the mud. He didn't however wait for a response, he lined the bottle up against an end table and slammed his fist down on the lid. He pulled the bottle away now without it's lid. The word thanks tried to push its way out of my mouth but I clamped my mouth shut. There was no way I was going to thank Spike Hammersmith, bane of my existence for opening a beer I only had the smallest of intentions of actually drinking. Taking the bottle from him I looked around the room trying to find a glimpse of Susan or Debbie. Finding none I put the bottle against my mouth and leaned back against the wall. The beer was bitter and I'm sure my face showed it because when I looked around Spike was holding in laughter, \"Why are you still here?\" \"That's not a very nice thing to say to a teammate.\" he held a hand to his heart. \"I'm not your teammate anymore.\" \"What?\" Spike turned to look at me properly he looked shocked, \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about two broken arms last year and freaked out parents unwilling to sign the permission slip. Why what do you care?\" I didn't feel like telling him that I would be helping out Coach instead. He looked too shocked and let down that I wanted to relish in the fact that he would miss me. Apparently horribly. \"I... I don't.\" he said quickly and awkwardly, his words sounded a lot more like he cared a lot. It brought a small smirk to my face, \"I was wondering why you were dressed like a girl instead of wearing your jacket.\" \"I always dress like a girl.\" I mumbled taking another swig from the bottle. \"Sure.\" the word was stretched and it was impossible to think that he believed what he was saying. \"I do.\" \"No. You don't.\" He pulled at the hem of my shirt feeling the fabric slowly, I could feel a knot of anticipation build in my body. His fingers were milometers from my skin and it tingled and burnt, \"Today you look... cute.\" the last word was quiet and if the music hadn't taken a sudden dip I wouldn't have heard it at all. \"Excuse me?\" my face flushed and I looked everywhere but at him, \"did you just say I looked cute?\" \"That's ridiculous,\" he laughed awkwardly not looking me in the eyes, \"obviously you've had too much to drink.\" he took the bottle from me easily. He brushed his hair out of his eyes and put the bottle to his lips, draining the bottle and putting it down on the end table next to him before I could say anything against it. \"Hey?\" Without looking at me he spoke, \"I'll get you some more...\" he disappeared quickly into the kitchen. \"So do you like Spike or something?\" Debbie's voice was quiet and seemingly came out of no where. Turning away from where Spike had just been I saw that Debbie had slid in next to me on the other side, silently like a spy or a ninja. \"Why would you say that?\" \"Well we've been here for an hour or so and the only boy you've talked to extensively is Spike.\" \"Spike has been talking to me.\" I defended kind of nervous that the only boy I've talked to was indeed Spike. This was not the way to go about getting a boyfriend. This wasn't how Debbie was going to find out which boys liked me. \"Well he's going to scare all the other boys away Becks. Come on.\" She grabbed my hand and pulled me to the middle of the room where about fifteen people were dancing. Top Five Reasons Debbie is Awesome 5) In spite of being a really girlie girl she loves me terribly and demands to hang out with me whenever I don't have practice. Which now is all the time 4) She's better than CNN. She knows everything that will effect my life almost immediately, seriously she should have her own show, or newspaper. 3) When I broke my arm the second time, which was during practice, yeah thanks a lot Spike, Debbie was the one to drive me to the doctors. She drove me to a doctors office the next town over in hopes to hide the fracture from dad and Patty. If the cast wouldn't have tipped them off the call from Coach Foster would have. Still the thought was pretty heart warming. 2) She is now dancing with me in the silly fun way that she usually reserves for family gatherings. She is laughing and doing The Sprinkler as we speak. She is making a fool out of herself because she is determined to find me a date to the upcoming dance if not several. I can tell her eyes are flitting about the room taking stock of the boys in the room, evaluating them. I think she might even have Susan in another room talking about me and noting the reactions. 1) The number one reason Debbie is awesome has got to be how far she is willing to go for me. Almost falling off the pyramid in order to get me the assistant coach position, wasting valuable boy time with me trying to prove Billy Patterson wrong. Her dedication to me and our family is mindboggling. Bonus reason) A couple of summers ago she kept look out while I punched Murphy in the face after he told me I would never get on the junior varsity team because I was a girl. According to Murphy girls can't do anything and frankly that didn't fly with Debbie. \"Don't look now.\" Debbie quirked an eyebrow and indicated with a jerk of her elbow toward the kitchen. I turned because don't look now almost always really means look at that. There leaning against the wall is Spike, he is holding two beers and chatting calmly with a girl who obviously wants his tongue in her mouth. \"Okay now we will find out how much Spike is into you.\" \"He's not into me.\" I sigh trying to put the cute comment and near touches out of my head. \"Oh he so is.\" Debbie is smirking and it looks unnaturally devious on her face, \"See that.\" She all but points at the girl Spike is talking to. He looks disinterested as she points upstairs. The girl looked flustered and storms away. \"That was Caroline Fletcher, she's the easiest senior at school. She just asked him to check out the bedrooms upstairs.\" \"How do you know that?\" Debbie shrugged, \"Because I paid her five bucks.\" I stopped dancing shocked at how underhanded this angelic looking blonde could be, \"You what?\" \"Oh don't look at me like that.\" she stopped dancing and grabbed a hold of my hand, \"It was only five bucks if she was willing to do something like that for five bucks she was probably going to do it anyway.\" \"Why did you do that?\" \"Well either we would find out how much he liked you, which by the way is a lot, or we'd get rid of him so other boys could make there intentions known.\" \"You've really thought this through.\" \"I'm an O'Shea of course I have a game plan.\" She smiled and I laughed a little, \"Did you want to go over there and claim your beer? Which by the way we will talk about later.\" \"I don't like him.\" \"Okay.\" \"You don't believe me do you?\" She shook her head and disappeared into the crowd leaving me once again alone. \"Here.\" a dark open bottle of beer slid down my shoulder. Had Spike really entered the dance floor after me? Taking the beer and turning around I confirmed that yes indeed he had. \"Umm thanks...\" The tempo of the pounding music suddenly dropped and a sweet slow melody pumped through the speakers. \"Is this The Beatles?\" Spike spoke, his dark strong voice soft and gentle as he listened to the song. It was actually Wings, it was Maybe I'm Amazed. But that's not what I was interested in at all. What had grabbed my attention was that we were in the middle of the room surrounded by slow dancing couples. Was he going to ask me to dance or was he going to stand there and talk about Paul McCartney and drink his beer. I think I was the most curious about which I wanted to happen the most. \"It's Wings actually.\" I whispered and taking a deep breath sucked back some of the bitter liquid. Not because I thought it would give me courage but more so because I needed something to do with my hands and my mouth. Spike didn't ask me to dance. He just took my beer and using his long arms put it as well as his down on a table. Without a word he took a hold of my body and pushed it closer to his. I swallowed hard and with slightly shaking hands tried to figure out where my hands were supposed to go. \"Give me this.\" He grabbed a shaking hand in his and we slowly swayed to the music. The fact that I didn't punch him in the face probably meant that I wasn't entirely opposed to his touch. Was it possible that his James Dean, devil may care attitude had gotten to me without me knowing it. He had never treated me like a girl before and I was beginning to understand his appeal. \"Do you like me?\" The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. \"I guess.\" Not exactly the declaration of love and passion I was expecting. The way Debbie talked I would have thought that he would lay his life down for me. \"I see.\" \"Do you like me?\" I shrugged, \"Maybe.\" If he could be vague so could I. If this was a sport like Debbie seemed to make it out to be I was going to play. I had been playing this kind of game with Spike for years. Giving him what he gave me. While this had always meant a rough tackle and a blood stained jersey before I wasn't going to let Debbie down. I was an O'Shea and we played to win. If he was surprised at my response he didn't show it and when the song ended he leaned down to look at me properly. His face was close to mine and I could feel the heat of his skin radiate, washing over me, speeding up my heart. \"You look good with your hair down like this.\" he smirked and walked calmly away. I narrowed my eyes and exited the dance floor myself. Game on Spike.[Chapter 3] A/N: So i had half of this sitting in my cell phone waiting for me to that weird little giant's craving I sometimes get. Well you're all in luck. A friend of mine had never seen the movie so I pretty much forced it on her and a week or so later here we are. Hope you enjoy. Chapter 3: The fight This felt weird. Weird is the only way to describe it. Never has there been such an eventful last day of summer. So far I've had a surprisingly civil conversation with Patterson, had my first beer, been guaranteed the student assistant coach position, been called cute and danced to Wings with Spike. Spike, who until today has been my rival and off field enemy. This is the guy who broke my arms, he's 100 percent the reason I can't play ball anymore. In fact my left arm hurts like a bitch when the weather is about to change. Am I really considering what it would be like to kiss the boy who turned my body into a barometer? Of course I am. I took another sip of the bitter liquid and searched the party for someone who would lend this night some sort of normalcy. \"Do I need new glasses?\" A deliberate and calculating voice reached my ears, not making any effort to be heard over the thumping bass. Looking around it was easy to find the source, \"Nubie?\" I smiled, Nubie looked the same as always, a little out of place with his collared shirt and tie. Exactly the comforting familiarity I was looking for. I placed myself on the wall he was occupying close enough that I could feel the starch in his shirt rub against the thin fabric of Debbie's sweater. \"Why do you need new glasses? Didn't you just get new ones?\" I asked tapping his frames. I was surprised when he wrapped his hand around my wrist. I'm not sure he's ever touched me before and it produced a slow burn and breathing became unnaturally hard but maybe that was the fog of beer making me think that. He rubbed his thumb against my skin gently before letting my hand fall away. \"Where you just dancing with Spike?\" \"Oh.\" I looked away, something in his voice sounded almost betrayed, the comforting feel of his presence changed into something else...I don't know what. \"So I don't need new glasses, I was worried I had been given the wrong prescription.\" We stood in silence for a moment, near touching, I have never felt quiet so awkward before. For some reason it now felt wrong what had happened between Spike and I. I pulled the last of the beer out of the bottle. Surely I must have made a face because Nubie's expression lightened. \"Why are you drinking? Don't you have try outs Thursday?\" \"No I don't.\" I sighed heavily and pointed at my most recently broken arm. He took it gently in his hands as if he could break it again and pushed up the thin black cotton hiding my skin from the world. He ran one hand up and down the skin, sending a shockingly warm feeling through me. \"It's healed pretty well.\" His words were soft and I had to lean in to hear him over the song. \"Better than the other one.\" I held up the other arm for inspection wanting his touch to last just a little longer. He took the bait and slid his hand along that one as well. Turning it carefully looking closely at the joints. \"Yeah, this was the first one he broke right?\" It felt wrong for him to accuse Spike outright like that, really I shouldn't have gone for those last yards, I knew better and now everyone seemed to think that he had purposefully snapped my bone. However I just nodded. \"Yeah you should have waited out the rest of the season...like I told you.\" His thumb rubbed the skin and I looked up into his eyes. They were a lot closer than I thought they'd be. I shrugged, pulling my arms easily from his grip and stepping a little bit away, \"They needed me to win state. I couldn't let something like a broken arm stop me, I'm the icebox.\" The words came out hard and sharp and as soon as they had escaped I wanted to pull them back in and hide them. I was ashamed and I could tell that Nubie knew that for he just shook his head slowly and pulled down one of the sleeves of the cardigan, \"maybe its for the best that you have to be Becky for awhile.\" And with that he left me. His words echoed through the music, and his touch lingered on my skin. Did I even know how to be Becky anymore? Things I didn't realize about Nubie until right now: 1) He got tall, almost a foot taller than me, a slender tower in a tie. 2) Ties are kinda cool. I've only really seen Dad or Uncle Kev in a tie before and dad just looks like dad and Uncle Kevin looks...well like a car salesman. Nubie however looks like he should be teaching at a college or editing a newspaper. Which as of now seems really cool. 3) His eyes are a ridiculous blue. Dazzling even, and they just radiate this powerful intelligence. 4) Something about the way his skin felt on mine felt right. A comforting slow burn I never would have associated with Nubie. And I think most importantly, 5) That betrayal in his voice cut me. \"So we have two options I see?\" Debbie grabbed my arm as she walked by. She dragged me through the house into the backyard before I could think of anything to say otherwise. The backyard was light up by old christmas lights in the trees, creating oddly festive pools of light. In a rather green pool of light Susan was leaning against a tree apparently very \"interested\" in what Bryce Lesko had to say. I noticed that Billy was standing in another pool of light with Junior looking very interested in putting his fist through Bryce's face. Bryce is Susan's almost boyfriend, I know this almost entirely because Billy loves to talk about how stupid this guy is. I completely agree with Billy, Susan can do way better than this jackanape, so I don't feel the slightest hint of remorse when Debbie and I invade the pool of light. \"Leave.\" I tell him, and thankfully I still have enough credibility that this causes him to scamper away like a puppy. \"What's happening?\" Susan asks completely unphased by Bryce's hasty exit, proving once more why he is not her boyfriend. \"Becky has two prospective suitors.\" \"Spike of course, but whose the other?\" Susan asks and I have to wonder if she said Spike because she saw us inside or if perhaps this has been a long time coming and I was the only one who didn't know. Part of me hopes its the later. \"Nubie.\" Debbie tells Susan quietly as if its a secret. Susan, who is pulling lightly on her hair nods as if she was silly to not have seen it. \"He made a move after Spike made his intentions known?\" She whispers surprised, \"that's impressive, I didn't think we'd get another on line.\" \"No kidding, but I didn't think we'd have use of another one but look at her.\" Debbie points at me and I have no idea why but Susan must because they share a knowing smile. Girls have there own secret wordless language that I know nothing about. This knowing smile and that movement of her hand apparently mean much more to Debbie than to me because Debbie nods excitedly in agreement to Susan's silent statement. They look at me sharing a conversation in a language I don't understand for two whole minutes before a break down, \"what is it!\" \"You like Nubie.\" Susan says smiling. \"Of course I do,\" I shrug and even thou I know what they mean I pretend that I don't, \"We've been friends forever.\" Something about what Nubie had said to me makes me want to keep the whole transaction a secret. The whole party doesn't need to know that I think the team can't do a thing without me. Debbie especially, having her know I don't know how to just be myself anymore seems devastating. \"You know we don't mean like that.\" Debbie's voice is stern and straight. She saw right through me, I don't know why I bother, I mean even Jr can see right through me now. Am I really that much of an open book? \"So which boy do you want?\" Susan asks and suddenly I feel like I can't breath. She says the question like it's as simple as asking if I want a drink or not. I need an escape, a way out anything. I lock eyes with Junior over Debbie's shoulder. If I'm such an open book he should be able to tell I need him. All he does is smile and wave before turning back to his conversation with Patterson. You've got to be kidding me! He's supposed to be my brother, he's supposed to have my back. What happened to him knowing me so well I can't lie to him? What use is a brother if he's not going to rescue you! \"Becky?\" Susan asks waving a hand in front of my face, \"What's that matter?\" \"Nothing's wrong with her she's trying to get out of this conversation.\" Debbie deadpan's. Sure she gets it right away. And that's when I see it. Behind them Patterson has launched himself at Bryce. \"No look.\" I point, smiling more than I should. They turn around and I can hear Susan's sharp intake of breath. In no time at all some of Bryce's friends enters the scuffle, one punching Junior right in the gut, the other holding him. Well that's it isn't it? I pull Debbie's girly cardigan off and drape it over her shoulder. There's no way I can let my brother fight TWO guys. Top Three Reason I'm in this fight: 3) Junior is my brother and friend, this means there are certain obligations such as covering for him when he's in trouble and of course coming to his aid in an unfair fight. Even if he didn't come to mine. 2) I really prefer Patterson to Bryce. Bryce is a jerk and Susan deserves much better. And of course the number one reason I'm punching Jamie Foster in the liver is; 1) It stops the conversation about if I like Nubie...that way. Something I don't know and don't want to talk about. \"Becky!\" I hear Susan and Debbie yelling from the sideline's as almost everyone in the backyard gets pulled into the fight. It is easy to ignore there concerned yells when Orson Tanner has his hand wrapped in my hair. This is the very reason I never have my hair down. I don't care if it looks cuter down, it's a liability. \"COPS!\" Someone yells as another person joins the fray. Total panic breaks out and Orson quickly pulls his hand from my hair so he can runaway like a coward. Then again the last place I'd want my police officer father to find me is in a fight with a girl, completely hammered. It's almost as if the fight explodes, everyone involved seems to burst away from the centre like there lifes depend on it. \"Icebox come on!\" Someone yells and pulls me away from the fight my fist hitting the air in front of Bryce's nose. The flashing red and blue fill up the backyard as the person who has me by the collar pushes me over the back fence. We run four blocks before I turn to see who had pulled me out of the fight. It's Patterson and Briggs. \"Billy?\" I slow down, there are no sign of any cops, the siren and the flashes long gone. I rest a moment hands on knees watching the blood drip from my knuckles onto the sidewalk, wondering briefly if it's mine or if it belongs to someone else \"That a good enough distraction for you Icebox?\" Briggs laughs. \"What?\" I straighten up looking at them closely. \"Junior said you needed a distraction and well Billy was looking for an excuse to punch Lesko's lights out all night...so...\" Briggs stretched lazily looking from one to the other before shrugging, \"My house is just over there, I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" He started to walk off towards his house but before he disappeared completely from view he turned and yelled back, \"Nice job getting the assistant couch job Icebox!\" Hmm maybe Briggs and Patterson weren't that bad after all. I mean they did get in a huge fight just so I could delay a conversation with Debbie, and they pulled me out so I wouldn't get in trouble. \"How does he know I got the assistant couch job?\" I asked Patterson as we started walking back toward my house. Billy shrugged, \"The whole team knows...except Spike we like watching him squirm.\" \"Squirm?\" \"Well yeah.\" Billy told me around his fingers, I'm pretty sure his saliva wasn't going to bring down that swelling. He stopped and looked at her, \"he's totally in love with you, you knew that right?\" \"Oh.\" My face is hot and I can't breath, \"Yeah I totally knew that.\" I am lying and even the cat that just wandered out of the Baker's yard knows it. \"Oh shit.\" Billy's face is flushed in embarrassment, \"I thought you knew that. We all thought you knew. I thought you just didn't like him.\" I have no idea what to say, until very VERY recently that was probably true, but would it have stayed true if I had known all this time that he 'loved' me? Wait a second? How long has he loved me? Did he break my arms out of love? I think not. \"Boys are confusing.\" I muttered. Billy sighed heavily, \"Girls are confusing.\" He returned and frankly I couldn't disagree I mean I was a girl and even I didn't understand what was going on half the time.

I'm going to borrow it for a bit though. Story Summary: A series of moments in the lives of the Little Giants characters. Each chapter is a one-shot and they aren't necessarily in chronological order. Chapter Summary: This is Becky's only shot and she's not going to let her Uncle mess it up. Author's Note: This is set post-movie by a few weeks. All ages are the same. And, just a warning, I ship Becky/Spike so there will be leanings towards them if not an outright relationship. There's a longer A/N after the story. Oh, and this hasn't been beta-ed so all mistakes are mine and feel free to point them out. Hope you enjoy it! *Edit: I fixed some grammar and other mistakes. Should read a bit better now.* Becky barely held back a sigh as the final buzzer of the game sounded. It was already the fifth game of the season and she had only played a few minutes each game and only when her Dad was in control. And that was only when they were winning by a huge margin and Kevin was convinced that nothing his little brother did could cost them the game. Of course that meant she hadn't played at all this game since they had been losing for most of it. Becky knew her uncle didn't mean to hurt her feelings, or crush pride for that matter, but he did. Every time he picked a player who wasn't as good as her instead it felt like a punch in the gut. She didn't want to say anything about it to the guys for fear of being labeled a drama queen. And she certainly didn't want to mention anything to her dad since he and his brother were finally getting along…off the field anyway. But she couldn't keep quiet after this. They had almost lost! The only reason they won was because Spike had a brilliant, last second run into the end zone (though she would die before ever admitting that). And it wouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened. They should have had this game in the bag. If only Uncle Kevin had put her in. She knew with every part of her ten year old soul she could have stopped at least two of the other team's touchdowns. She didn't want to sound arrogant or cocky…it was the truth. She was good and she could have stopped them. Becky growled softly as she watched her teammates form a line to congratulate the other team before going to join them. Did her uncle really think he was going to jeopardize her only shot at football glory while she sat idly by? He should know her better than that. And since she couldn't go to her dad without looking like she was whining she would go directly to the source of the problem. Yes, she decided, as soon as the other team was congratulated and everyone had gone home, she would find her uncle. And then they were going to have a little talk. \"Hey, Pom-Pom, good job today. I haven't seen bench sitting that good since…last game!\" Yes, she and her uncle were going to have a talk. Unless , she thought to herself as Spike sauntered by with a smirk, I get thrown in jail for Neanderthal homicide . Kevin looked up from his paperwork as his wife opened the office door. \"Kevin, you have a visitor.\" Karen smiled as he waved to indicate she show them in and sat back in surprise when his niece walked into his home office. \"Icebox,\" he greeted her as he got up to give her a hug. \"Hi Uncle Kev.\" He waited until they were both seated before he asked, \"So what brings my favorite niece by so late?\" He got a little worried when she didn't even crack a smile at their little joke. \"It's about the Little Giants.\" When she paused he motioned for her to continue. \"I want you to let me play.\" \"I do let you play.\" \"No, Dad lets me play. You put me on the sidelines whenever you coach.\" \"Becky, I can't play you every second of every game,\" he admonished. \"I know that Uncle Kev but you never put me in. And if Dad puts me in as soon as you take over you pull me out.\" Kevin shook his head and he leaned back in his chair, \"Now honey, you know I can't show favoritism.\" Becky started shaking her head before he even finished talking, \"That's not it. It would be favoritism if I wasn't any good and you put me in anyway. But I am good and you still won't let me play. Why?\" Her question almost sounded like a plea. \"Becky, honey, the other players are good.\" \"Yes, but I'm better.\" \"Now Becky…\" \"No, it's the truth. I am better. I know it. You know it. They even know it. So why won't you let me play Uncle Kev?\" Definitely a plea this time. Kevin looked at his niece and realized she knew what his answer was going to be. She just wanted him to say it. So Kevin got up, walked around his desk, crouched in front of her and gave her the true she didn't want to hear. \"Becky, you're a girl.\" Becky crossed her arms over her chest, \"So?\" Kevin sighed as he straightened up. \"Becky, you're a girl and the boys are bigger and stronger than you. I don't want you to get hurt.\" Becky glared up at her uncle as she gave him the truth he didn't want to see, \"No they aren't.\" \"Yes they are Honey.\" \"No Uncle Kev, they aren't. Not yet.\" \"What?\" \"They aren't bigger or stronger than me. Not yet. They will be Uncle Kev, but not yet.\" Becky sighed as her uncle stared at her unconvinced and tried to make him understand. \"Look Uncle Kev, I'm not stupid. I know that in a couple of years all the boys will be bigger than me and stronger than me, except maybe Jake…and Tad. But right now I'm bigger than or as big as everyone on the team. Except Spike and he's part Neanderthal so he doesn't count…even though I can still put him in the dirt half the time. I know I'm not going to get to play College Football or start in the Pros. Hell, I'm probably not going to get to play in Jr. High or High School either. All the guys will be bigger and stronger than me and they'll worry about hurting me. So this is it, Uncle Kev. This is my one and only shot to play football with the guys and have it be normal.\" Becky looked up at him, and when he didn't say anything, continued. \"I'm not asking to play all game, every game but I want to play. I want to go out there and pass and run and score and tackle, \"she gave a small grin, \"Especially tackle, before the guys start treating me different and holding back so they won't hurt me.\" She stood up and finished. \"This is my only shot Uncle Kev, please let me take it.\" Then she hugged him and walked out the door. Karen walked in a few minutes later after wishing her niece a good night to see her husband half sitting on his desk with a stunned look on his face. \"Kevin what's wrong? You look like you got tackled by the entire Vikings defensive line without a helmet on.\" Becky was nervous as she got ready for practice on Tuesday. She hadn't seen or talked to her uncle since their talk last Saturday. She was worried he would treat her differently. She was even more worried that he wouldn't. With all of this weighing down her young mind she was slower getting ready than normal and was one of the last players out of the locker room (her own, private locker room…she was a girl and in some situations that did matter) and on the field. \"What's wrong Pom-Pom? Bad hair day?\" Spike teased as she finally joined the team. Before she could go and give him a bad hair day, complete with mud, grass and possibly a little blood, she felt someone put a hand on her shoulder in restraint. She glared, ready to give the intruder a piece of her mind when she realized it was her uncle. \"Alright, cool it and gather around. It occurred to be after watching the tape of Saturday's game that we almost lost. And it was pointed out to me it was my fault and I could have prevented it. So, we're going to make some changes. Briggs and Hayden, you will be alternating as wide receiver starter. Vennaro, you'll start running drills with Spike so we can improve your foot work. And Icebox, you'll be our starting fullback from now on.\" He waited until the cheers and groans had died down before starting practice. \"Alright, alright. Get on the field for endurance drills. Icebox, front and center.\" \"Yeah, Uncle Kev?\" \"I'm not doing this because you are my niece. I'm doing it because you are better and you deserve a chance to show it. And Becky, this might not be your only shot. But if it is, I'm…I'm sorry I almost messed it up for you.\" Kevin knew he had made the right decision when Becky simply smiled before running off to join her teammates. That decision was reaffirmed a little while later when the IceBox put Spike in the dirt…for the sixth time in a row. Though he couldn't really understand why she rubbed mud into his hair before letting him up. Author's Note: I love this movie and I've wanted to write some fanfic based on it for a while and I finally figured out how I wanted to do it. This won't be updated regularly since my job is crazy! This will be more like stress relief. However, I do already have about 25 chapters outlined so we'll see how it goes. It will be listed as complete since each chapter is a one-shot. Please review if you are so moved. And if you have any ideas on a oneshot let me know. I'll be more than happy to try and write it. And to all those who received this alert because of my other stories, I promise they are going to be finished, even There's No Place Like Home. I just don't know when. My inspiration has disappeared down the yellow brick road. As soon as I find it I will finish all my stories.[Chapter 2] Title: Snapshots Chapter Title: It's a Girl! (Part 1) Author: KourtTears Pairings/Characters: Danny O'Shea, Becky O'Shea, Wife O'Shea Rating: PG Disclaimer: Little Giants is not mine. I'm going to borrow it for a bit though. Story Summary: A series of moments in the lives of the Little Giants characters. Each chapter is a one-shot and they aren't necessarily in chronological order. Chapter Summary: He could see the whole future laid out in front of them and it was perfect. Author's Note: Short and completely cliché but it wouldn't get out of my head. There's probably going to be a few other chapters with this theme (and title). Danny's wife's name and Becky's full name were never revealed so I got to pick. Hope you enjoy. \"Daniel O'Shea?\" After a moment's pause the nurse spoke again, \"Is there a Daniel O'Shea here?\" This time a man on the other side of the waiting room jumped up and hurried to her. \"Yes, here. I'm Danny, I mean Daniel, how's my wife? Can I see her?\" \"Your wife is fine and she is asking for you. If you'll follow me please.\" Danny barely felt the encouraging clap on the shoulder from his older brother as he made his way down the hall and to his wife's room. He knocked gently and then took a deep breath to calm his nerves before entering. \"Hi honey, you up for a visitor?\" Marilyn smiled at him and tiredly nodded her head. Danny stepped into the room slowly made his way over to his wife to see the little bundle in her arm. \"Oh Mari,\" he breathed as the little face came into view. Marilyn let her husband get by with shortening her name, something she detested, since it was such a big day and all. \"Danny, let me introduce you to your daughter, Rebecca Anne O'Shea.\" \"Rebecca. Mari, she's beautiful.\" As he reached out to pick his little miracle up and cradle her to his chest he pictured all the things he was going to do for his Rebecca. He would dress up for tea parties and play with dolls just for her. He saw himself dropping her off for ballet lessons and watching her perform at recitals. He could imagine the nerves of her first boy/girl dance. He could even see her as a cheerleader and getting ready for prom. As he walked his daughter around the room he could see the whole future laid out in front of them and it was perfect. \"I know you were hoping for a boy.\" It took a second for the statement to penetrate his joyful planning. With a smile he looked at his wife, \"A boy? No, I just wanted our baby to be healthy and she is. She's perfect. Absolutely perfect.\" When she started to fuss he handed her back over to her mom and watched them for a long while. \"You know, I think she looks like a Becky.\" Danny waited to see what his wife would say but when she didn't answer he finally tore his gaze away from his new daughter to see his wife had fallen fast asleep. He picked up Becky, deposited a kiss on his wife's forehead with a whispered 'thank you', and set his little girl in the bassinet before leaving. He walked to the waiting room and didn't even try to hide the goofy smile on his face (not that he would have been able to even if he had tried). His brother stood while his heavily pregnant sister-in-law smiled as he approached them. His smile got just a little bit bigger, \"It's a girl!\" Author's Note: I know that Dad's can be in delivery rooms nowadays but back when this would have taken place I believe most fathers were left to wait. I could be wrong of course. Hope you liked it![Chapter 3] Title: Snapshots Chapter Title: Following Orders Author: KourtTears Pairings/Characters: Spike, Mike Hammersmith (Spike's Dad), various others in the background Rating: PG Disclaimer: Little Giants is not mine. I'm going to borrow it for a bit though. Story Summary: A series of moments in the lives of the Little Giants characters. Each chapter is a one-shot and they aren't necessarily in chronological order. Chapter Summary: That was the first thing he ever learned, to please his father Spike just had to follow orders. Author's Note: I love Spike. I especially like how he clapped for the Little Giants when they won. And how he told his dad to calm down after they lost. It did seem a bit abrupt though so here's my take on Spike's transformation. Hope you enjoy it! Spike's first memory is of his dad…and a football. His dad had put the football on the floor and said, \"Push the ball Spike.\" Spike did because it was easy and he wanted to please his father. That was the first thing he ever learned, to please his father Spike just had to follow orders. A few years later Spike started his 'real' training. Meaning he ran and did pushups and pull-ups and sit-ups. And while he didn't really enjoy the actual exercise he did enjoy spending time with his dad. Spike especially enjoyed it when his dad was proud of him. It was easy, almost as easy as all the 'training'. And when he won the race when he was younger than every other participant he decided if following orders meant he would win and winning meant his dad would be happy then he could do that. A few years after his first win Spike's mom passed away. It was also the first time he had ever seen his dad cry. He had been walking by his parents' bedroom when he looked in and saw his dad sitting on the bed holding a picture of his mother. At first Spike thought his dad was just sitting there and then he saw his dad's shoulders shake. He wasn't sure what to do so he went into the room and sat down on the bed by his dad. But before he could do anything else his dad noticed him. \"Spike, start packing, we're moving. I want to be out of here by next week.\" Spike didn't know what to think at first. He really didn't want to move. This was his home. He had friends here. And this house was where he had all his memories of his mom. He didn't want to leave her behind. He started to tell all of this to dad when he realized that he didn't want to see his dad cry anymore either. So to make the one person he had left (and loved most) in the world the only thing he said was, \"Yes sir.\" Spike left his dad sitting on his bed staring at his wife and made his way back to his own room. If this is what it took to make his father stop crying then he would follow orders. He was good at that. Soon Spike was in his new house in his new town, Urbania. Not the most original of names but it was where the great Kevin O'Shea had come from and where the great Kevin O'Shea had come back to. And the great Kevin O'Shea was coaching a peewee football team which was all his father could talk about. Correction, it was all his father would talk about. So Spike followed the unspoken order, no mentioning Mom or home or anything that wasn't football related. Unspoken orders were as easy to follow as all the other orders. Spike just had to look at his dad and he knew what to do. And then there was the next order. The 'go with this man who looks nothing like the great Kevin O'Shea and play football' order. Spike would have argued but this was the first time his dad looked really excited and not just faking it. So Spike got his gear and went with the small Kevin O'Shea. The next order was one Spike was happy to follow. There was no way he wanted to play football with those losers. Peewee hell didn't even begin to cover it. Spike got in the car with his dad and the REAL Kevin O'Shea and sighed. Finally, an order he would gladly follow. As they drove away he ignored the voice in the back of his head saying that it would have been fun to play against the Ice Box. Just to put her in her place of course. Next was the order Spike was ashamed to say he followed. \"Take Junior Floyd out of the game.\" How he wished he had ignored that order. He knew it wasn't right but an order was an order and he had been following orders since he could remember. So Spike did what he was ordered and ignored the sick feeling in his stomach. And then the game was over and he was standing in shock with his teammates. They had lost. They. Had. Lost. How did it happen? How was it even possible? Spike looked over at the Little Giants yelling and cheering, and just for a second wished he had stayed with them. But no, he had followed his dad's orders. Even the ones he didn't agree with and it had led him to this. To being beaten by a bunch of scrawny little losers. He had to admit it though; the Giants had played a good game. They hadn't given up even after that horrible first half. Maybe they deserve the win. So he clapped and urged his teammates to clap too. And when his dad shook his head to tell him to stop Spike didn't follow the unspoken order. He kept clapping and decided that blindly following orders wasn't what he wanted anymore. And when the next order was \"Stay away from that Ice box, cheerleader girl\", Spike ignored him. Really, how was he going to show her that girls shouldn't play football if he stayed away from her? Author's Note: That was fun. I love making up back stories for characters. Hope you enjoyed it! ","Summary":" Title: Snapshots Chapter Title: Only Shot Author: KourtTears Pairings/Characters: Becky O'Shea, Kev"},{"Movie":"Little Giants","Title":"Friendship, Love, and A Secret","Author":"tookool4you","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4268416","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It has been two years since Becky and Junior's parents got married and things (to Becky) couldn't have been worse. Junior still left the toilet seat up and stayed in the bathroom longer than anyone. \"Junior, come on,\" yelled Becky to the bathroom door. \"I will be out in a minute\" \"You said that ten minutes ago,\" said Becky getting annoyed. 'I wish I had my own bathroom' thought Becky bitterly. It was the same thing every single morning. \"You could at least let me in there first,\" whispered Becky. \"Yeah, but what would the fun in that be?\" asked Junior as he stepped from the bathroom door. Becky shoved him out of her way and rolled her eyes at him. 'I can't believe I had a crush on THAT' thought Becky as she brushed her teeth. Since she began living with him and saw how gross he was she had been questioning the guys she liked. \"Beck I wanted to remind you that you have football practice today and after that you need to help me with the gas station,\" called her dad from the living room. Becky secretly hated helping with the gas station. Junior and his friends were always hanging out there and Junior didn't help at all. Becky had to cover his jobs and she was sick of it. \"Dad, Junior has to help this time,\" she would always tell her father. \"He will. I promise princess\" The promise was broken every weekend. Becky knew her dad really did not want to act like he was Junior's father, but she thought that something had to be done. \"Junior you have to help with the gas station today,\" said Becky as they walked to the bus stop. \"Why?\" \"If you don't I will tell Patty. I mean it, I hate doing everything by myself\" \"No, you hate not having friends\" It was true that Becky did not have a lot of friends. The only friends she really had was the friends she had since she had began playing football. She really never cared before, but when Junior said that it she felt it. Junior noticed how silent Becky was being and he felt bad. He didn't mean what he said. Yeah, she didn't have a lot of friends, so what? It doesn't mean anything. \"Beck I am sorry. I didn't mean how it sounded,\" said Junior putting an arm around his sister's shoulders. \"Awww…What a sweet sight. Can we see a kiss?\" said a familiar voice. Junior and Becky really hadn't noticed where they were going; they were too rapped up in their own thoughts. They turned their heads towards the voice and rolled there eyes. 'I should have known…'they both thought at the same time. \"No, but if you keep talking like that I will have Becky kiss you,\" said Junior smiling. \"Yeah right, like I would kiss that toad,\" said Becky also smiling. \"Like I would want to kiss her,\" snapped Spike. Becky walked towards Spike and sat down next to him on the curb. 'But what if I want to kiss you?' thought Becky. 'What am I saying? It is Spike.' Since his dad began getting really upset with Spike and hitting him Spike hasn't been mean. Becky was the only one who knew. She saw Spike in the park one night struggling to stand and when she saw his face she screamed in horror. His face was all black and blue and she could barely recognize him. \"Spike, what happened to you?\" Becky remembered saying, but he could not respond. It hurt him too much. Now as she sat there next to Spike on the side walk she could remember how he looked, he looked so helpless. All she wanted to do was hold him in her arms, but she would never tell anybody that. His face was still a bit bruised, but he looked alright. She went to tough his shoulder gently, but he winced in pain. \"Spike, have you told anyone?\" whispered Becky. \"No and don't you say anything. It's my fault anyways. I should have learned not to bother him so much\" \"Spike you can't really believe that. Even if you are getting on his nerves he should know how to deal with his temper,\" whispered Becky harshly. Spike helped Becky from the curb when he saw the bus coming. \"Just promise me you won't say anything,\" whispered Spike as the bus doors came open. \"I promise,\" said Becky.[Chapter 2] It was hard for Becky to keep Spike's secret. Everybody kept asking her what was wrong with him when he went to school and was limping or when he was in too much pain to do football practice. \"I don't know what is wrong with him,\" said Becky when they asked. About a few months into their new friendship Becky was getting sick of keeping the secret. She felt so guilty when he went to school and he was hurt, she felt like it was her fault. \"Spike, I can not keep doing this,\" said Becky at football practice one day. \"You promised,\" said Spike sounding irritated. \"Yeah, but I think promises like this is suppose to be broken when the person I promised it to is getting hurt. Plus, it is better than broken bones\" Spike laughed at this and he would have laughed, but his side hurt too much. All he did was nod which put a smile on her face. 'Why do the smallest things make her smile?' Spike thought puzzled. 'Wait, this is Becky. Why do I care?' \"See you later,\" said Spike when he saw his father's car pull up. \"Yeah, see you\" Becky waited for her father on the bench where she and Spike were sitting a while before. She felt helpless. 'I wonder what Spike is doing right now' thought Becky. Spike sat in his room doing his homework and listening to his favorite band on the radio. He suddenly heard a large thud coming from outside the bedroom door. 'Not again' thought Spike closing his eyes as hard as he could. He heard his father come in and slam his fist hard on the desk he was sitting at. \"I thought I told you to bring home dinner tonight?\" said his father. \"I couldn't…I had…practice,\" said Spike. \"Remember, you picked me up?\" Spike hated when his dad got drunk. He was a mean drunk and took all his anger and frustration on him. Also, it was the only time that Spike felt very vulnerable. \"I will go get it now,\" said Spike quickly as he rushed out of the door. Spike thought that he made it, but behind him his father wasn't going to let him. His father grabbed his arm hard and pulled him down to the floor. When he was on the floor his father started kicking him hard in the side. All Spike wanted was for it to stop and when it did he was relieved. It wasn't until he tried to get up did he feel the pain. Even though he was in a lot of pain he knew he had to leave the house. Spike only could get to the park before he had to stop. He didn't know what to do, so he did the only thing he could. He called Becky. \"Becky, can you please meet me in the park?\" asked Spike. \"Yeah, are you alright? You sound…not like yourself\" \"Just meet me here. Please, don't ask questions\" \"I will be right there,\" said Becky sounding concerned. When Becky got there she saw Spike sitting on a swing. She walked very quietly so she wouldn't startle him. Even with that when she put her hand on his shoulder he flinched. He had been doing that a lot lately. Every time someone did something suddenly around him, he flinched. It wasn't only her that noticed it, it was also his teachers. \"Are you ok?\" asked Becky. \"I can't go back there,\" sobbed Spike. \"It's ok. I will ask dad if you can spend the night tonight\" \"Won't he ask questions?\" \"No, he is cool\" Spike tried to get up, but couldn't. Even with Becky helping him to her house it still took them twice as long than normal. Spike was relieved that Becky was right about her father not asking any questions. Becky just made him a bed on the couch and that was that. Her dad and stepmother treated him just like he was one of the family, even though they had their differences over the years. Junior was the only person who acted weird about him being there, but Spike didn't mind. It was so peaceful in the house that he fell asleep quickly. Spike didn't have his normal nightmares with him waking up drenched in sweat and shaking. It was the first time that he could remember that he had a nice dream and wasn't worried what the next day would bring.[Chapter 3] The next morning Spike woke up to the sound of Junior and Becky having a fight. It sounded to him that he was the subject of their argument. \"Why is he here?\" yelled Junior. \"Keep your voice down. He might hear you. Also, it is none of your business why he is on the couch. If dad didn't even ask why would you?\" said Becky in a hushed tone. \"He is my enemy and has been since we were younger, or don't you remember? He thought that girls couldn't play football, if I remember correctly you planned killing him in his sleep\" Becky laughed as she remembered when she and Junior actually planned to kill Spike. They had set a date and everything, but that was about the time when Spike and Becky became friends. \"Why are you protecting him? I don't know what you are protecting him from, but be sure that I will make it my goal to find out,\" said Becky. Becky thought long and hard on what she was going to say to Junior. She ended up telling him her deepest darkest secret. Becky knew that Junior had never told anyone her secrets, so she trusted him with this. \"Are you serious?\" asked Junior. Becky nodded in response. She hadn't even noticed before that she had been crying. She cried when she was both angry and sad. Junior had also noticed that she had been crying. He hated making her cry, even if it was because she was angry at him. Junior didn't know what to do, so he did the only thing he could think of. He brought his sister in a bone crushing hug. When he did this it always made her laugh. When Becky and Junior walked into the living room they both noticed that Spike was awake. Both Becky and Junior smiled over at him. Spike thought that was weird because Junior had never smiled at him. Every time they looked at each other Junior usually gave him a dirty look. \"Good Morning, did we wake you?\" asked Becky sitting on the couch. \"No, I usually wake up at this time,\" lied Spike. \"You and Junior are about the same size so he agreed to give you some clothes to wear today. I know the preppy look is not you, but they are clean\" \"I am feeling adventurous today, so I will wear the clothes,\" said Spike looking over at Junior. Spike knew that Junior wanted to say something, but didn't. He thought that was weird, but didn't give it a second thought. He had something more important on his mind that was bothering him. \"Becky, did you tell Junior the reason why I spent the night?\" asked Spike in a hushed tone. The question surprised Becky, it was out of nowhere. 'Why would he even ask that?' thought Becky. 'Does he even think I would do that?' \"No, I didn't. I told you I wouldn't, so I haven't\" \"You also said that the secret was something that should be told\" \"I meant like a counselor or the police, not my brother,\" said Becky sounding irritated. \"Then why is Junior suddenly sort of being nice to me. He hasn't given me a dirty look in almost 24 hours or any smart remarks\" \"Maybe he thinks you two being idiots is stupid and wants to finish it…I know I do\" With that Becky left Spike to his thoughts. She thought that Spike and Junior were being stupid for having this feud all these years. 'When will they ever learn?' thought Becky before she was shoved in Junior's room. \"How rude,\" said Becky. \"I never agreed to have that animal wear my clothes,\" hissed Junior. \"I think you did. I asked you when you were asleep last night. Did you know you talk in your sleep?\" Becky saw Junior's face grow red. He was hoping that Becky wouldn't know because that he talked in his sleep. It was just another thing that she would make fun of him for. \"Please, do this for me,\" whispered Becky. \"I really like him and I know that it was unfair to ask you while you were asleep, but it seemed like the only way that you would agree to it\" Junior let out a groan and Becky knew that he was defeated. Becky kissed her brother on the cheek in thanks and left him to pick out Spike's clothes. She felt really pleased with herself until she found her father snooping in her room. \"Dad,\" shrieked Becky. \"What are you doing?\" \"Ummm…nothing sweet pea\" \"What are you doing?\" she repeated. \"I was trying to find what you've been hiding from me. Why is Spike here? Are you doing drugs? Why is Spike here?\" \"Dad, I am not doing drugs and I thought that you were cool with Spike sleeping on the couch. If you were not, then why did you let him?\" Becky sat on her bed and patted a spot for her father. He immediately felt uncomfortable. He could not believe he was in this situation with Becky. They had always had an open relationship. They told each other everything, or so he thought. She also knew how he felt about Spike. \"Spike was, remember, your enemy. Remember you and Junior planned to kill him in his sleep?\" \"What is with you and Junior? Spike is my friend, why is that so hard for you to believe?\" Becky could feel tears swelling up in her eyes. 'Why know?' she thought. \"Becky I am sorry,\" whispered her father putting his arms around her shoulders. \"I got to get to school\" Becky left for the bus stop early not waiting for Spike and Junior. She could not handle everyone asking her questions about Spike. It was becoming very difficult for her to keep his secrets and it was hurting her inside to lie to her father. She had never lied to him, even if she knew the truth would hurt him. 'How can I do this?' thought Becky.

This is going to be a Junior/Becky story. I don't understand why most of the fanfictions about Little Giants are Spike/Becky. Too wierd. But anyway, here it goes... Oh, and by the way, this is my first fanfiction. Please don't be too harsh if you decide to review. I would greatly appreciate any reviews though :) Becky's POV I don't get it, I thought to myself. I've been going over the same event in my head for the past three hours, trying to figure out what it means. Today, after we beat the Cowboys, I was celebrating with my dad; you know, jumping up and down, screaming, that type of thing. All of a sudden, Junior comes running up and joins in. Not only does he join in but he totally butts my dad out of it by grabbing my hands and jumping up and down away from him. Of course, I didn't mind considering I have the hugest crush on him. Anyway, as we were celebrating I guess we both realized that we were kinda having a moment. He stopped jumping so I did too and he gave me this funny look. I thought he was gonna walk away. But then he smiles and starts celebrating again. I was pretty excited. For hours I've been trying to figure out if this means he likes me. It probably doesn't. I mean, I'm the Icebox, his teammate. I'm no cheerleader like Debbie. I tried that and it's no fun. So I had to decide between Junior and football. I chose football, and even though I really like Junior, I love football. Just as I was about to go over the situation one more time in my head, someone knocked on my door. \"Come in!\" I yelled. My dad poked his head through the narrow space between the wall and my now slightly open door. \"Sweetheart, there's someone at the door for you,\" my dad said with a wink. Why did he wink? , I thought. He's just weird. I sprinted out of my room and slid down the staircase railing. \"Nice landing. I give you 10 points for that one, Becky,\" a voice said. I spun around to find myself face to face with Junior. I took a few steps back, not because I wanted to but because we were so close and I was a little surprised. \"Oh hey, um what are you doing here?\" I asked, trying not to sound too nervous. \"The team is all at my house celebrating. I came to get you,\" Junior said with a smile. \"Okay, let me go ask my dad.\" \"Wait, my mom said to bring your dad, too. I think she likes him,\" he said, obviously pretty weirded out by the whole thing. I was pretty weirded out, too. I ran upstairs to get my dad and try to do something with my hair before we left. Ever since I met Junior, I've been wearing it down more, like a normal girl. \"Dad, come on! We're going to Junior's!\" I yelled to him. \"Becky, go have fun. I think I'm gonna stay in tonight,\" he replied. \"No, Dad, his mom wants you there.\" My dad rushed out of his room mumbling something that sounded like, \"Why didn't you say that in the first place?\" I ignored the comment and followed him back downstairs. All three of us loaded into the truck. Me and Junior were kinda smushed together awkwardly cause there wasn't much room in this car. Luckily, the ride there wasn't too long.[Chapter 2] Junior's POV The ride to my house was really awkward, but almost in a good way. I don't know how that works but it just does. Me and Becky were sitting really close. Ours legs were touching and our shoulders were smushed up against each other. I don't think she liked it, which made it awkward. But I was loving it, so it was kinda good. So if you couldn't tell from that last sentence, I'll just put it out there. I like Becky. But nobody knows that, and nobody will. There's no way she likes me back so I'm not gonna let anyone find out. I've liked her for a pretty long time, I just wasn't completely sure of it. I mean, she's the first girl I've ever really liked. That day that we first met, I remember it like it was yesterday... (Flashback) \"He throws.. It's up... Yeah! Touchdown!\" I yelled in the supermarket once the roll of toilet paper landed perfectly in my mom's shopping cart at the end of the aisle. It landed on top of a pile of about 20 other toilet paper rolls I had thrown. I didn't think anyone was listening to me. A few old people looked at me like I was crazy but that's what they all do. They'll give you weird looks but then keep walking along 'cause you're just a kid. But anyway, I picked up another roll and threw it into the cart with a grunt. Three kids ran right up to the shopping cart with crazy looks in their eyes. One was a short black kid with a shaved head. The second was an even shorter baby-faced blonde kid. The last was a chubby kid with freckles and a backwards hat on. I threw another one and they all stared down at it in awe when it landed in the cart with a thump. \"What a throw,\" the black kid said. Then the chubby kid said something that I couldn't understand. All of a sudden I heard mumbling coming from my left. I turned and saw a pair of eyes through the shelves that quickly disappeared. I ignored it. I had another roll of toilet paper and figured maybe those kids wanted to get in on the action. \"Hey buddy, catch this!\" I yelled and threw the black kid the roll. He caught it and they all looked a bit surprised. \"Good catch!\" I yelled. \"Nice arm,\" he said admiringly. Then the three of the approached me. \"Junior Floyd,\" I said, introducing myself. \"I'm Hanon,\" said the black kid. \"Zolteck,\" said the chubby one. \"I'm Tad,\" the tiny one said. \"Cool,\" I replied. \"You wanna play some football?\" Zolteck asked me. \"Yeah, let's see that arm again,\" Hanon agreed. I was about to say yes but I heard something coming from where I heard the mumbling just minutes before. I ducked down because I knew that someone was spying on me. I had the perfect surprise attack planned. The three guys just stared at me like I was crazy. \"Hey you!\" I screamed as I popped up right in front of the spyer. She let out a small scream and the shelves went tumbling down on her. We ran around to see who it was. Hanon, Zolteck, and Tad laughed a little bit so I assumed they knew her. She had her hair tied back with a backwards hat covering it, a vest, long shorts, and some dirty boots. She was dressed like one of the guys. She dug her way out of the boxes of food that she was buried in and looked up, a little embarassed. I noticed her face was covered in donut powder. \"Hi,\" she said shyly. I thought she was really cute. After that, I found out her name was Becky, aka the Icebox, and her dad was coaching a peewee football team. I definitely wanted to join. I told her that her dad should come by my house to make sure it was okay with my mom, but I secretly hoped that she would come too. I didn't know why I was feeling like this. I never thought about a girl this way before this. Girls were annoying. They didn't like sports, they didn't like anything fun, they were boring. But she was different, very very different. Her dad showed up at my house a few hours later. I was lounging on my couch, playing with a football in my hands, watching TV. I saw out of the corner of my eye someone at the door. It was only for a split second but I was pretty sure someone was there. And it looked like Icebox. Turns out, it wasn' was only her dad. He came in and had a nice talk with my mom, apparently they knew each other from way back in dinosaur times. I sat on the couch trying to listen, but all of my concentration was on controlling my mouth. I knew if I didn't concentrate on this, I would blurt out something asking why Icebox wasn't with him. That would probably sound pretty suspicious. All of a sudden I heard, \"What do you say, Junior? You wanna play for us?\" I snapped out of my concentration. \"I'm sorry, what?\" I asked, not realizing what he was asking. \"Junior, would you like to play on Coach O'Shea's team?\" My mother asked, probably a little embarassed by the fact that it looked like her son was completely zoning out, which I was. \"Oh, yeah of course,\" I said. This required no thought. I loved football and I'd get to see Icebox more. This is gonna be great, I thought. (End of Flashback) When we got to my house, the party was in full swing. Coach O'Shea went immediately to find my mom, which left me and Becky standing on my lawn alone. I like that name, Becky. I just started calling her that today. At the game, when she decided to play for us, I said, \"Hey Icebox, kick some butt.\" She replied with, \"Call me Becky.\" So now that's what I've been calling her. I like calling her that better anyway. Icebox was too much like a guy, or a teammate. Becky fits her so much better. At that moment I realized how much I liked her. So naturally, tonight when the team was all at my house and they asked who wanted to go get her, I was the first to volunteer. So anyway, as I was saying, we were standing on my lawn alone. She started to walk inside but I grabbed her wrist. I decided that I needed to tell her I liked her. It was too hard to be with her when she had no idea. \"Come get a soda with me,\"' I said. I wasn't ready to go into the party with all those people and have to fight for her attention. Right now I had it, and I was taking advantage of it. She followed me into my garage and I flipped the light switch. However, the lights were pretty old in there so it only got dim. I grabbed two sodas out of the fridge and sat down on the hood of my mom's car. She sat down next to me. \"Why's it so dark in here?\" she asked. \"I don't know, the lights are old.\" \"You should probably get some new ones. This lighting isn't good for anything.\" \"Well, I wouldn't know, but you know what I bet it's good for?\" I asked. I didn't even really know where I was going with this. Words came out of my mouth before I even had a chance to think about it. \"What?\" she asked, confused. \"Kissing,\" I replied. Wait, what? I thought to myself. I don't wanna kiss. What am I saying? \"I thought you didn't want to learn how to kiss?\" she asked, even more confused than before. She was referring to the day at the lake when me and her had a conversation about kissing. (Flashback) \"Look, if I had to learn how to kiss, and I mean, absolutely, positively, no way out of it, no matter what, can't get out of it, had to learn how to kiss... Well then I.. I think I wanna... Learn with...\" Come on, Junior! Just say it! I thought to myself. What's the worst that could happen? ... Well, she could scream and run away. Or she could slap you then run away. All new scenarios kept popping into my head and they all ended with her running away. And I did not want that to happen. Just say it, Junior. It's really simple. You already said the sentence, just finish it off with a \"you\". Tell her you'd wanna learn with her! I was still debating with myself. \"Lemme guess,\" she said. \"Debbie.\" She sounded kinda upset. I said the first thing that came to me. \"I don't know,\" which probably sounded like a yes. (End of Flashback) And she was right, I didn't want to learn how to kiss, not yet. But in some situation where I absolutely had to, I would definitely pick Becky. \"Well yeah, I mean no. I mean, I don't want to. But I was just saying it's the right lighting I think. And anyways, you never let me finish what I was gonna say that day at the lake.\" Here it goes, I thought. I'm gonna tell her. \"What do you mean?\" she said, most likely trying to recall the exact conversation. \"I was about to say who I would want to learn with but you kinda cut me off,\" I explained. She looked at me as if to say \"go on\" so I continued. I scooted a bit closer to her as I began my next sentence. \"I was gonna say I'd want to learn to kiss with-\" \"Hey guys, what are you doing? We've been looking for you everywhere! You're missing the whole party!\" Zolteck exclaimed, barging into the garage. Maybe this is a sign that I shouldn't tell her, I thought. And with that, we both followed Zolteck back into the house to celebrate.[Chapter 3] Author's Note Okay, so first off, I'd like to apologize for not writing in so long. I had a bunch of family stuff going on and when I finally got back on Fanfiction, my inspiration was gone. Second, I'd like to apologize for this author's note. I know, author's notes suck. But I felt that this was necessary. With all that being said, I want to keep writing this story. The only problem is that I'm kinda lacking in the idea department. That's where you guys come in. Just let me know if you have anything that you want to happen in the story, I'm open to pretty much anything. I might even abandon the story and make this a bunch of one-shots if that's what you guys want. So anyways, just tell me your ideas and if you want me to continue the story or make some one-shots. Thanks everybody for even reading my story. I didn't think anyone would. You guys are the greatest!

Cependant elle avait attendu que Cosmo soit parti pour le faire. Étant donné qu'il était toujours plus au moins à leur côté, Don en était à se demander depuis combien de temps elle attendait cette occasion pour avoir une discussion. Et surtout, il se demander de quoi elle voulait discuter. Qu'est ce qui est si personnel ou si important pour que Cosmo n'ai pas le droit de l'entendre ? Ils étaient donc dans la maison qu'ils partageaient tout les deux (bien que le plus souvent ce fût tout les trois) depuis maintenant deux ans, autour de leur table, à se regarder dans les yeux. Lui commençait à être impatient et elle, semblait chercher ses mots, et la manière d'aborder son sujet. Elle fini par se dire qu'il fallait qu'elle reste égale à elle même, et qu'elle y aille franchement. \" Tu es en couple avec Cosmo. \" Il rit. Que pouvait il faire d'autre, c'était ridicule, comment avait elle pu en arriver à une telle conclusion ? Kathy, de son côté, restait de marbre. Ce n'était pas la réaction qu'elle attendait, mais elle ne laissait rien paraître. Elle était sérieuse. \" Tu m'expliques d'où tu tiens ça ? Articula Don entre deux respiration, c'est n'importe quoi, tu es au courant ? Je suis marié avec toi. - L'un n'empêche pas l'autre. \" Don repris son sérieux. \" Et bien, si ça te rassure, non, je ne suis pas en couple avec mon meilleur ami. - Je ne cherche pas à me rassurer. Ça fait longtemps que je suis consciente que je passe après lui. Je cherche juste à te montrer la vérité en face. \" Septique, mais curieux, il lui demanda des détails. Ce qu'elle fit avec une facilité déconcertante selon l'acteur. Il l'a savait capable d'argumenter sur n'importe quel sujet, après tout, elle était aussi belle, qu'intelligente et cultivée, mais il ne s'attendait pas à ce qu'elle soit capable de lui sortir un liste de raisons pour lesquelles lui et Cosmo pouvait être un couple parfait. \" Pour commencer, vous vous connaisssez depuis très longtemps, ce qui fait que lorsque l'un ou l'autre va mal, vous êtes capable de le savoir et de règler le problème en un rien de temps, sans même vous échanger un mot. De plus, votre proximité est telle, que vos mouvements, même si vous ne semblez pas vous en rendre compte, sont toujours synchronisés, et je ne parle pas seulement de lorsque vous dansez. Ce qui m'emmène au prochain point, vous partager les mêmes passions, la danse, le chant, la musique... Bien sûr que j'aime ces choses aussi, comme beaucoup de monde, mais quand vous faites l'une de ces choses entre vous, on dirait que le monde autour n'existe plus. Vous êtes dans votre bulle. Et pour finir, je dirais que les regards que vous échangez par moment sont bien plus intimes que toutes les nuits que j'ai pu passer avec toi. \" Don était choqué par ces mots, si vrais. Il avait remarqué quelques fois, certains de ces faits, mais ne c'était jamais attardé dessus. Il avait passé tellement de temps avec l'autre homme, que tout cela lui semblait naturel. Et maintenant que Kathy les lui exposait, ça lui apparaissait comme une évidence. Cosmo et lui aurait parfaitement pu être ensemble. Voir même plus que ça. Ils auraient pu faire le plus merveilleux des couples. \" Admettons que tu es raison. - Tu vois ? - J'ai dis 'admettons'. Tu as conscience que Cosmo et moi sommes tout les deux des hommes ? Donc nous ne pouvons pas être ensemble dans tout les cas. \" Ce fut au tour de Kathy de rire cette fois. \" Tu sais, l'homosexualité à toujours exister, si c'est la seule chose qui t'empêche d'être avec lui, je veux bien faire semblant d'être ta femme devant les médias. - Mais il n'y a pas que ça, il y a aussi le fait que Cos et moi ne sommes pas en couple. - Mais pour combien de temps ? Je veux dire, tu l'aimes, c'est évident, et ça l'est aussi qu'il t'aime. Il faut juste que l'un de vous le dise à l'autre. - Et toi, qui m'aime aussi, ça ne te fais rien de me donner des conseils pour que j'aille voir ailleurs ? \" Elle se leva de sa chaise, et alla vers la fenêtre, elle avait un sourire nostalgique sur les lèvres. \" Tu sais , commença-t-elle, ça fait un moment que je me suis rendu compte de tout ça. Dès le début même. Mais j'ai commencé par me dire que j'avais tort. Que j'étais juste jalouse pour rien. Mais j'ai fini par l'accepter, et par me contenter de la place que j'avais dans votre relation. - Mais je t'aime aussi ! - Plus que Cosmo ? - ... Ce manque de réponse était plus que révélateur pour l'un comme pour l'autre. - Qu'est ce qui a fait que c'est aujourd'hui que tu me le dis ? - Déjà il fallait il une occasion où Cosmo ne serait pas dans les parages. Ce qui est, tu le reconnaitras, de plus en plus rare au fil du temps. Et puis... J'ai envie d'avancer moi aussi. J'ai longtemps cru que tu serais mon grand amour. Je me suis trompée. Mais dans ce cas, j'aimerais le trouver et vivre ma vie par moi-même. \" Don ne pouvait qu'être d'accord avec elle. \" Tu a raison . Je pense... Je pense que je me suis trop menti. Il faut moi aussi que j'avance. Kathy ce détourna de la fenêtre et tout en sortant de la cuisine elle ajouta \" Bon bah ça c'est réglé, ce soir tu lui dis, j'irais chez une amie manger et passer la nuit, et demain matin, je m'en vais chercher un appartement. Depuis que je travaille au studio avec vous, j'ai de quoi le payer, mais il faudra juste un peu de temps pour que je fasse mes bagages. Don se leva à son tour et la rattrapa, un peu affolé. \" Attend ! On est obligé d'aller si vite ? Je veux dire... Ce soir c'est tôt, et puis tu n'est pas obligé de partir si vite... - Tu n'as quand même pas peur de lui parler de tout cas, n'est ce pas ? - C'est pas que j'ai peur, mais imagine que je ne trouve pas les bons mots. Ou que ce ne soit pas réciproque en réalité, je fais quoi moi ? - Ok. Donc tu as peur. Le grand Don Lockwood, séducteur confirmé a peur de confier ses sentiments à son soit disant meilleur ami alors que leur amour est complètement évidemment ! \" Répliqua t-elle en sortant enfin de la cuisine en rigolant et faisant des gestes dramatique. Une fois dans le salon, elle commença à danser et chanter à tue tête \" Don et Cosmo sont amoureux \", Don quand à lui, la poursuivait, dans l'espoir de la faire taire. Cette chausse dura jusqu'à ce que la porte d'entrée s'ouvre sur un Cosmo, sifflotant sa dernière composition, qu'il venait de travailler avec l'orchestre. \" Bonne après midi les amoureux , lança t-il un fois que les deux autres l'avais remarqué. \" Et bien, je vous souhaite la même chose, à demain \" répondit Kathy en enfilant son manteau, juste avant de se retourner, faire un clin d'œil à Don et sortir de la maison. Cosmo se tourna vers son ami, un air étonné sur le visage. \" Qu'est ce que vous complotez tout les deux ? - Rien dont tu ne seras pas au courant ce soir. \" Lui répondit il en passant son bras autour des épaules de son camarade, le guidant jusqu'à canapé. Kathy avait raison. Plus tôt il agissait, mieux ce serait. \" On a parlé elle et moi. \" Cosmo se senti mal un instant. Ils avaient parler sans lui. Ça veut dire qu'il avait parler de lui. Probablement pour lui demander d'arrêter de traîner chez eux. Il savait que il était trop présent pour laisser le couple s'épanouir. Mais il savait aussi qu'il n'arrivait pas à laisser Don, sans qu'il le regrette. Celui-ci remarqua le changement d'expression de son ami. \" Je pense que le couple que je forme avec elle, n'existe plus. - Tu as rompu avec elle ? Tu sais que tu ne trouveras pas de filles aussi parfaite qu'elle ? \" Une lueur d'amusement passa dans les yeux de l'acteur. \" Ça tombe bien, ce n'était pas dans mes projets. \" Cette fois ci, Cosmo était perdu. \" Tu te lances dans le grand célibat maintenant ? - Pas exactement... - Aller Don, dis moi ce qu'il se passe, c'est pas juste ce que tu me fait là. Le musicien ressemblait à un enfant impatient à présent, et son ami décida de tout dire. \" D'accord. \" Il respira un bon coup. \" C'est Kathy qui m'a quitté. Elle ne me l'a pas dit directement, mais ses paroles le laissait entendre. Elle pense que entre toi et moi, il y a quelque chose, si tu vois de quoi je parle. ** - Donc elle pense que tu m'aimes, si j'ai bien compris. Tu lui as rappeler que j'ai fouillé la ville entière pour la retrouver, juste parce que tu n'arrivais pas à te la sortir de la tête ? - Non, cependant je pense que cet exemple n'aurai qu'appuyer son propos. - Comment ça ? - Tu vois tout ce que tu as fais pour moi ? Tout ce que tu fais dès que je me sens un peu mal ? Et ce depuis que l'on se connait ! - Tu aurais fait la même chose. Et tu as fait la même chose, lorsque nous étions encore à danser et chanter dans n'importe quel endroit qui nous offrirait de quoi dormir et manger un peu. Tu n'hésitais pas à partager ton pain avec moi lorsque j'étais malade ou à me laisser plus de place dans les lits que l'on partager dans nous n'avions pas de quoi en payer deux. C'est normal que j'agisse pareil. Un sourire triste passa sur les lèvres de Don. Ses sentiments pour son ami aurait commencé à ce moment là ? Il ne savait pas trop. Ce qu'il savait en revanche c'est que aujourd'hui, ils étaient bien présents et les avoir accepté avec l'aide de Kathy, semblait les avoir renforcer, vu la force avec il se retenait d'embrasser l'homme face à lui. Est-ce sa faute à lui, si Cosmo, en pleine incompréhension, ressemblait à un petit chiot ? \" C'est cette complicité, et cette confiance qui a poussé Kathy à penser ça. Et je n'ai pu, par conséquence, qu'être d'accord avec elle. - Tu es en train de me dire que tu as validé sa théorie comme quoi il y avait autre chose que de l'amitié entre nous. - Oui. \" Les deux hommes étaient tout à coup très conscient de l'étroitesse du canapé sur lequel ils étaient assis. Cosmo brisa le silence qui s'était installé. \" Et comment peux tu être sûr, mon cher Don, qu'il s'agisse aussi de mon avis aussi ? ** - Je n'en suis pas sûr en réalité. - Tu veux dire que là, tu attends que je fasse un signe pour confirmer à mon tour l'hypothèse de Kathy ? \" Demanda-t-il, un sourire malicieux sur les lèvres, en se retournant vers son ami. \" S'il te plaît, Cos, fait quelque chose, ou va t'en, mais là j'aimerais que le malaise s'en aille. - Alors tu dois le dire. - Quoi donc ? - Que tu m'aimes. Si c'est vraiment le cas, dis le moi. \" Alors qu'il évitait tout contact visuel depuis qu'ils étaient assis, Don se retourna, planta son regard dans les yeux bleus qui le regardait déjà et lui dit avec la plus grande sincérité \" Je t'aime. \" Dieu sait que Cosmo avait attendu que Don lui dise ces mots depuis très longtemps. Lui qui avait bien plus rapidement compris de quel nature était les sentiments qui l'occupait en présence de l'autre homme. Lui qui l'avait longtemps entendu dires ces mots à de nombreuses femmes, coup d'un soir ou plus. Lui qui en avait souffert. Mais qui c'était toujours débrouiller pour que Don ne le sache pas. Alors Cosmo se leva, monta debout sur le dossier du canapé, mis ces bras en signe de victoire, pointés vers le ciel, et cria \" YES ! \" Avant de se laisser tomber en arrière, sur de la moquette, mais dans un bruit sourd. Don qui avait observé la scène ce leva précipitamment, alla auprès de son 'ami', qui le regardait depuis le sol, allongé, avec un immense sourire sur les lèvres. \" Ça va ? - Parfaitement - Tu viens tout de même de chuté. - Ton amour pour moi m'a atteint avant la douleur, donc ça va. \" Don ne put s'empêcher de rire à cette réplique. \" Bon par contre, aussi fort ton amour soit il, je commence à sentir la douleur dans mon dos, aide moi à me lever. \" Alors qu'il s'apprêtait à le relevé, Cosmo tira sur son bras, le faisant tomber à ses côtés. Ils étaient donc là, tout les deux allongée sur la moquette, regardant le plafond. Songeurs. Aucun des deux ne savais trop quoi faire maintenant. Un détail cependant revint à l'esprit de Don. \" Tu ne m'as pas dis que tu m'aimais. \" Il regarda le musicien. Celui-ci avait toujours le regard fixé au plafond. \" Parce que j'aurais pensé que pendant toutes ces années, tu l'aurais deviner. Alors je profite que pour une fois ce soit toi qui attend un signe, plutôt que moi. - Depuis quand ? - Depuis aussi longtemps que je m'en souvienne. - Ça fait un moment alors, tu n'es plus très jeune. - Tais toi va, tu es plus vieux que moi je te rappel ! Viens là. \" Fini par conclure Cosmo en ouvrant ses bras. L'autre homme vint s'y glisser. Il n'avait pas pour habitude d'être l'enlacé, mais il devait reconnaître que c'était agréable. Ce retrouver au chaud dans l'entrainte de son camarade de toujours. Cosmo, qui était plus grand, releva la tête de l'acteur, par un geste qui indiquait clairement ce qui allait ce produire. Et juste avant que leurs lèvres ce rencontrent, il glissa un à peine audible \" Je t'aime \". Bien qu'un habitué des baisers, Don n'avait jamais ressenti autant d'envie, et de passion que dans celui qui été en train de se produire. Et quand ils se séparèrent, à bout de souffle, ce ne fut que pour mieux recommencer. Lorsque ils eurent suffisamment rattraper le temps selon eux, ils se levèrent enfin. Mais seulement pour s'asseoir sur le canapé. 'Asseoir' était un bien grand mot car même si Don l'était, assis, Cosmo si laissa tomber de tout son long, et par conséquent se trouva allongé, la tête sur les genoux de son... \" Je pensais, on est quoi du coup maintenant ? Pas que le terme d'ami ne me conviennent pas, mais disons que je n'ai généralement pas l'intention d'embrasser et de coucher avec mes amis. \" Le rouge vint aux joues de Don. Mais c'est vrai que la question de cette masse allongé à moitié sur lui était pertinente. \" Et bien, officiellement, étant marié, il te reviendrait le titre d'amant, mais je doute qu'il te convienne ? - Exactement. - Donc tu es mon petit copain. Mon amoureux. Rien de moins. \" Et c'est à ce moment là que la porte s'ouvrit. Sur Kathy. \" Desolée, mais il se trouve que mon amie n'est pas là. Alors j'ai beau être aller balader pour faire gagner du temps à Don, il a fallu que je rentre parce que je n'ai pas envie de manger seule, et que j'ai faim. Et ce que j'ai sous les yeux actuellement confirme ce que je te disais plus tôt, Don. Vous êtes dans une position qu'un couple pourrait tout à fait avoir, et pourtant, je n'ai aucune idée de si vous vous êtes parlé, cette scène est tellement naturelle entre vous deux, je me demande comment vous avez fait pour tenir jusqu'à maintenant sans vous rendre compte de rien. \" Don se leva. Cosmo tomba sur le sol et se releva par une pirouette sous l'œil amusé des deux autres. Suite à quoi les deux hommes se prirent la mains, et tout trois se dirigèrent vers la cuisine. Don pris la parole en premier. \" On a effectivement parlé, et j'aimerais savoir ce que toi tu allais faire. Je veux dire, nous sommes toujours mariés malgré tout. - Je te repropose ce que je t'ai dis plus tôt cet après midi, je suis toujours marié avec toi, pour les médias, jouant Mme Lockwood, mais je prends un autre appartement. Pour que tu puisses vivre avec Cosmo en toute tranquillité. Cependant, si un jour je retrouve quelqu'un, je me permettrai de divorcer. - Ça me paraît tout à fait acceptable. Je te remercierais jamais assez de tout ce que tu as fais pour nous, et ce en l'espace d'une après midi. \" Sur ce, ils se mirent à faire à manger, tout en discutant, comme à leur habitude, rigolant de leurs blagues, chantant et dansant toute la soirée. Don et Cosmo cependant, ne se lâchaient plus la main. ","Summary":" Kathy voulait lui parler. Cependant elle avait attendu que Cosmo soit parti pour le faire.

The rows filed out into the lobby, discussing the phenomenal play that they had just sat through. Praise spouted from nearly every mouth in the room, and the people looked forward to returning home and relaxing after such a pleasant night at the theater. Among the happy and satisfied faces was an uncharacteristically unflashy and a very grumpy Lina Lamont. The Hollywood leading lady wore the cheaptest, least sparkly outfit she had in her closet, wistfully thinking that she could have gone to a flashy premiere. Instead, she had sat in a dingy old seat watching a play with no action, constant talking, and a cast where everyone was a useless nobody. Well, almost everyone. Lina fought the urge to elbow her way out of the crowd of people leaving the small theater, knowing that making a scene would only draw attention to her. What would her fans think if they saw her spending time in a cruddy little theater watching a dumb play? And even more frightening, what would the press think? It was these fears that ran on repeat in Lina's head as she finally made her way outside, crept her way into the nearby alley, snuck in through the side entrance of the theater, and silently slid into the play's leading lady's dressing room. \"Lina!\" Kathy Selden turned from her vanity when the door opened and the Hollywood starlet entered her room. Her eyes widened in worry. \"You can't be in here!\" \"Oh, calm down, ain't nobody saw me come in,\" Lina huffed. \"I snuck in through the back. Kathy hardly seemed mollified. \"Are you sure?\" she asked, craning her head towards the door as Lina shut it. \"Whaddya' think I am, dumb or somethin'?\" Lina crossed her arms and stared Kathy down, challenging her to suggest just that. \"I ain't so ready to have the press swarmin' in here to find out just what Lina Lamot is doin' in a crummy joint sneakin' into a room of some nobody actress.\" Kathy's shoulders finally relaxed, and she brushed away the insult from the moody blonde. She stood up from her chair, brushing the last of her stage makeup away with a cloth. \"So how was it? You weren't too bored through it, were you?\" she asked, speaking softly as she approached Lina. \"Oh no, it was a real thriller,\" Lina replied, not trying to hide the yawn that stretched her painted mouth open. \"A mile a minute.\" With almost anyone else, Kathy might have started a passionate speech about the majestic art of theater and how it could never compare to movies. Instead, she pictured Lina Lamont, who loved the silver screen and all the overblown cheesiness that Hollywood pumped into their pictures, sitting down for two hours to watch a show with no orchestra accompaniment, no action, no brawny heroes, and full of talking. It warmed her heart to imagine it, even though she could visualize Lina nodding off several times when she wasn't on stage. \"Oh Lina, darling, I'm so happy you came,\" she crooned, melting into the other woman's arms. Lina couldn't help but smile as Kathy's warm body pressed against hers. \"Well, it wasn't too bad. You're really somethin' under all those theater lights.\" A terrifying thought suddenly crossed her mind, and she grabbed Kathy's shoulders and pushed her back so she could give her a worried look. \"I ain't gotta go to the show tomorrow night, do I?\" The brunette laughed, and Lina was captivated by her round cheeks and sparkling eyes. \"No, of course not. I wouldn't put you through that again.\" Kathy's smile quivered gently as she took Lina's face in her hands, tears of happiness threatening to spill from her eyes. \"Thank you.\" Lina often enjoyed going to afterparties following premiers, even for stuffy old plays, but that wasn't an option for her anymore when Kathy was involved. The blonde would have to duck out of the theater, leaving Kathy alone in her dressing room again. They would take two separate cabs home to their little apartment, farther from the studio than Lina would have liked but a necessity to keep the press from discovering them. This thing she had with Kathy took more work than Lina had ever done for anything in her privleged life. But when Kathy leaned in to kiss her and Lina could rub her fingers through her lover's short brown curls, she found the work was worth it.

She nodded and walked to her work station. Moments later Lina walked in wearing her white mink fur cape. \"Good morning Ms. Lamont, what can we do for you?\" Alice asked with a forced smile. \"I'm here to see what you'll be making me wear in this film,\" she answered in her usual high-pitched, nasally voice. Alice pulled out her sketches of Lina's dresses. \"These are my ideas. They are accurate to the era and are as suited to your tastes as can be.\" \"The color is all wrong and it's not fancy enough,\" Lina complained. \"This is the color that will show properly on film, and the place of your character in the court of Miss Selden's character does not allow for a fancier dress. You simply cannot out shine her in the film, no matter how much you would like to,\" Alice explained, only just managing to mask her frustration. Lina had just opened her mouth to object when a voice came from the doorway. \"Yeah Lina, Kathy is the star after all.\" The two turned to see Cosmo leaning against the door frame. Alice smiled at the sight of him. \"I'm a star too!\" Lina whined. \"If you're a star then Miss Selden is the sun,\" Alice retorted. \"Now, if you'll excuse me I need to find Mr. Lockwood.\" \"Well, if you'll follow me milady I'd be happy to take you to the man you seek,\" Cosmo said as he made a grand gesture leading out the door. \"Thank you my good sir,\" Alice smiled and walked to his side. The two strolled along together in a comfortable silence until a thought struck Cosmo. \"What do you need Don for?\" \"I want to make sure his costumes fit properly. I left them in his room earlier so he could try it on when he got the chance and could try a few steps in them to make sure he can move and dance well enough,\" she explained. They heard clapping emanating from an open stage door and decided to peak in. They saw Don tapping and twirling in pantaloons, and a jacket over a ruffled shirt that seemed to fit him like dream. Cosmo and Alice walked in and sat next to the source of the clapping, Kathy. When Don stopped dancing his audience of three erupted in cheers. \"Thank you, thank you,\" he dramatically bowed. \"Looks like that fits you fine,\" Alice said as she stood and looked Don up and down. \"It feels great, and so do the other costumes. You've done a brilliant job,\" he told her. \"Thank you,\" she nodded and turned to Kathy. \"How do your dresses fit?\" \"Wonderfully,\" she smiled. \"That's great. Now if I could only make Lina happy with the sketches I'd be able to actually make the costumes.\" Alice turned to leave but Cosmo caught her hand. \"Say, why don't you stay? I'm sure Lina's still bothering Danielle, do you really want to go back to that?\" he asked, knowing the answer. \"No, but I've done what I needed to. Unless you have a need for me there's no reason for me to stay, other than simply wanting to,\" she responded, slipping her hand from Cosmo's. \"But I do need you. I'm trying to write a symphony.\" \"Where do I come in?\" \"You'd be my beautiful muse,\" he told her as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. Alice blushed and smiled,\" As flattering as that is, I'm afraid Danielle wouldn't buy it.\" Alice walked back to the costume department and made it there just as Lina was leaving. \"D'you have fun with your boyfriend?\" Lina asked in her nails on a chalkboard voice. Alice thought for a second and realized who the Prima Donna meant, \"Last I checked, Cosmo isn't my boyfriend. He is a friend, and he is male, but we are not dating,\" she said. \"Well there are people that even that little annoyance of a nobody is too good for,\" Lina sniffed and walked away. Alice wanted to say so many things in defense of herself and Cosmo, but couldn't seem to find her voice, and so she sulked back to her desk to get back to working on Lina's costume designs. Don, Cosmo, and Kathy were walking back to Don's dressing room when he put an arm around Cosmo. \"So Cos, what were you doing in the costume department?\" \"I heard Lina, and you know how I enjoy ruffling her feathers. Happily I heard Alice beating me to the punch,\" he explained. \"Oh?\" \"Oh yes.\" Cosmo told them what happened. \"That's some girl. She's not afraid to tell Lina no. Most expect that'll get them canned.\" \"It usually does, but R.F. seems to like her.\" \"Maybe he thinks Lina needs to hear just what Alice told her,\" Kathy offered. \"I'd agree with him if that were the case,\" Cosmo said. \"As would I, but back to the original question. What were you doing in the costume department?\" Don prodded. Cosmo held up his hands. \"I've been caught. I was going to see Alice and say good morning to her, maybe even chat a little and poke fun at Don.\" \"So you like her?\" \"Yeah, she's beautiful and full of moxie. Why?\" \"Don't you need a date to the Halloween party?\" Kathy asked. \"I would if I were going, but I'm not, so I don't.\" \"Perfect. Alice needs a date to that phantasmagoria reenactment that you were interested in going to,\" Don grinned. \"She's going to that?\" Kathy and Don nodded. \"Wait, I can't just invite myself, and there's no reason for her to invite me, and how do you know she's going?\" \"She mentioned it to Don when she was taking his measurements,\" Kathy told him. \"I mentioned it to Kathy over lunch that day,\" Don continued. \"And I brought it up while she took my measurements. She said she had and extra ticket and I mentioned you,\" Kathy concluded. Cosmo sighed. \"She still needs to ask me.\" \"I doubt she's immune to your charms,\" Don winked. \"You mean she's not like all the other girls I've met.\" \"Hey, I think you're charming.\" \"I meant all but you Kath.\" She hugged Cosmo, \"I know,\" she winked. Cosmo walked back to the costume department in hopes of talking to Alice and ran into her just as he reached the door. Alice knelt down to pick up her scattered sketches, \"Sorry, I didn't see you there.\" Cosmo knelt to help her, \"It's no trouble, I was hoping to run into you anyway.\" \"You were looking for me? Why?\" \"A little birdie told me you were going to the phantasmagoria reenactment.\" \"You know about that?\" \"Yeah, I was thinking about going myself.\" Alice took the sketches that Cosmo had gathered and stood, \"I thought you'd be going to the Halloween party.\" \"I don't have a date, and the girls there always want me to get them into pictures. The phantasmagoria sounds like a lot more fun,\" he explained as he stood. \"Well, I have an extra ticket, perhaps you'd like to come with me,\" Alice offered. \"I'd love that, and I can take you out to dinner beforehand,\" Cosmo said with a bright smile. \"You mean like a date?\" she asked, not believing what she'd heard. \"Yeah, I suppose so.\" \"That sounds wonderful! I'd love to go on a date with you Cosmo,\" she beamed. \"You would?\" he asked in disbelief. \"You sound so surprised.\" \"So did you.\" \"Of course I did. You're the head of the music department, a script writer, and Don Lockwood's lifelong best friend, ergo too good for me, the little nobody of a costume designer,\" she admitted with her head hung low. Cosmo took her by the shoulders, \"Are you crazy?\" he lifted her chin, \"You're beautiful, funny, a fantastic designer, and you have the guts to talk back to Lina. Don and Kathy both adore you and are the ones that told me about you going to the phantasmagoria, which is just the icing on the cake. I never thought a girl as perfect as you would be interested in a sidekick like me.\" \"I've always preferred the funny man over the straight man, and you're the funniest man I've ever met,\" she blushed. \"And here I thought you'd be immune to my charms.\" \"Not a chance,\" she winked. Cosmo smiled, and remembered why there were in the doorway, \"Where were you going in such a hurry?\" \"I was going to look for Lina. I've made the dresses look as extravagant as possible without over shadowing Kathy or breaking the budget, but Danielle says I need Lina's approval before I can start making them,\" Alice explained. \"Why not just go to R.F. or Dexter? They could approve the dresses and though Lina would complain all you'd have to do is send her to them,\" Cosmo said. \"Easier said than done. I have no connection to R.F. or Dexter.\" \"You do now, but both of them have left to prepare for the party, as has Lina.\" \"Then I suppose that means I'm done for the night.\" Cosmo held out his elbow, \"Dinner and a show milady?\" Alice gladly took the offered appendage, \"Sound delightful.\" Cosmo and Alice left the theater arm in arm with smiles on their faces. \"That was so much fun Cosmo, and I'm glad you came with me.\" \"I had fun too, and I wish this could last all night.\" \"I'm not sure about all night, but you could come over to my place for a little while,\" she offered. \"I'd love to.\" Alice stepped over the threshold and held the door for Cosmo to enter. \"It's not much, but it's home.\" Cosmo shrugged off his coat and hung it on the rack before looking around the nearby den, \"I think it's quite cozy.\" Alice walked past him and sat on the couch. \"I'm sure you've gotten used to something more impressive than this.\" Cosmo joined her on the couch. \"Only because of Don. He's the one with the big, expensive house. I think this is bigger than my place.\" \"Really?\" He nodded. \"Even though I got a raise after 'Dancing Cavalier' I had to buy a new car after my old one decided to give up the ghost.\" \"Well, you're welcomed here anytime.\" \"Do you mean it?\" \"Of course. It's no fun being here all alone, and you make excellent company.\" \"I must say that you do as well. I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun without Don or Kathy,\" Cosmo smiled. \"I've had a lot of fun tonight too,\" Alice smiled back. \"Say, why don't I turn on the radio?\" \"That sounds great.\" Alice walked over and turned on her radio then tuned it to a soft music station. Cosmo stood and held his hand out to her. \"Care to dance?\" Alice took his hand, \"I'd love to.\" She stepped into his arms, but didn't bother with the waltz hold. She wrapped her arms around his neck, Cosmo put his hands on her hips, and lead her as they swayed in a small circle. They stayed like that through the first two songs, but as the third started Alice brought her arms down to wrap around Cosmo's waist, and rested her head on his chest. He drew her close, put his arms around her waist, and rested his cheek on her head. Alice wanted to nuzzle closer, she loved how Cosmo smelled, and knew that he wasn't wearing cologne as Kathy had mentioned that he never does. Cosmo felt as though any manner of death that involved the scent of Alice's hair would mean him dying happy. Alice's scent alone was intoxicating enough, but with the smell of her shampoo mixed in he was over the moon. When the fourth song ended the late night mystery show started. \"Have you been keeping up with this one?\" Alice asked. \"Of course, I love a mystery. Mind if I stay and listen? I'd like to know if someone new dies,\" Cosmo answered. \"I don't mind at all, but don't you think we should move back to the couch?\" she looked up at Cosmo with brilliant blue eyes that twinkled in the dim light of the sconces. Cosmo nodded, to dazed to speak, and was lead back to the couch. Once they were seated Alice cuddled closed to Cosmo, he draped an arm around her shoulders, and they listened to the radio program. They were kissing before it ended. Alice woke in bed the next morning feeling as though not even Lina Lamont would be able to upset her that day. The reason why stirred slightly next to her and she smiled as Cosmo drew her close. \"Good morning,\" he whispered sweetly in her ear. \"Good morning,\" she returned. Just as she settled into his embrace the phone rang. Alice groaned before going to answer it. \"Hello…Good morning to you too sir…I understand…Oh, I'll find some way to keep myself occupied…Oh, I'm sure that Mr. Lockwood would've done that himself by now…I see, well why don't I do that for you, it sounds like you could use some rest sir…Good day to you too sir,\" she set the receiver down and returned to bed. \"What was that about?\" Cosmo asked, still waking up. \"R.F. says we all have the day off. Everyone has a hangover, and I told him that's I'd make sure you knew seeing as Don is amongst those indisposed.\" \"Oh? Well, what would you like to do?\" \"Sleep in, spend the day in bed, or with you.\" \"Those are mutually exclusive.\" \"I know, but first, sleep.\" Cosmo nodded and the two curled up to rest for whatever the rest of the day might hold.

He was never supposed to be the leading man, it just isn't his style, so he stays behind the camera, where nobody gives him a second look. He plays his music, and cracks jokes about everything and anything (especially Lina), and goes with Don to premieres where nobody knows his name. And he writes confessions in his sheet music, taps out Morse code with his tap shoes, always the same message: I love you. He plays his piano, lets his eyes rest on Don lighting up the stage, and well, it's not exactly what they imagined in sleepy whispers, curled together on narrow and creaky cots after vaudeville performances in nowhere towns, but they're happy, aren't they? After all, Don still comes home to Cosmo at the end of the day, dances around the kitchen while Cosmo cooks, and sings in the bath while Cosmo works, and hot dog, this really is better than anything they could dream up. Don acts, and Cosmo talks to anyone who will listen about how someday he'll write his symphony, and that'll be the day, won't it? He even endures the jibber jabber of the Hollywood elites at stuffy Hollywood parties, cracks the jokes that make people look at him funny, but hey, he has a motto: make 'em laugh. Make 'em laugh, because laughing means they don't look too closely about how, no matter what gals are draping themselves over Don like slipcovers for a couch, Cosmo and Don always go home together. Make 'em laugh, because if they laughing, they're not seeing how Cosmo looks at Hollywood's leading man (and the way said leading man looks back at Cosmo). Make 'em laugh, because if they laugh in all the right places they might forget to ask about Cosmo's symphony. Because really, Cosmo composes with his heart, the melody spilling from his soul onto paper by way of his fingers, and the melody is one he taps out on Don's chest while Don sleeps in his dressing room between takes. And the melody is really Don's heartbeat because Cosmo's symphony is for Don, it always has been. Composing for Hollywood is his day job, but his symphony sounds nothing like his usual work, because this isn't for Hollywood. His symphony is gin and tonic kisses, and callused fingers, and the brave, brassy notes of a hero's song. It's for Don. It always is.

He remembers the way Lina treated Don when he was a stuntman, the way she only acknowledged his existence when it was absolutely required for the picture they were shooting, and the way he and Don would laugh it off after over a drink, still in awe of how this whole Hollywood unreality worked. And he remembers the first time Lina looked at Don, not only as an equal, but as a man; he remembers the tense feeling in his stomach and chest, and then the warm, melting feelings of amusement and relief, the latter such a deep and familiar sensation by then he barely registered it, when Don threw back at Lina her own snide attitude. And they had laughed at it that night, over a celebratory drink. Don was going to be in a picture, not just as a stuntman, but as a star. He was making their dream come true. And Cosmo was more than happy to sit at the piano and let Don take the wheel for the both of them. He distinctly remembers the gleam in Don's eye as they toasted his first picture that night, a shine that had nothing to do with the alcohol they'd imbibed. In retrospect, he should have seen it as a sign of things to come. Even though he knew it was a sham, even though he was there to listen to every one of Don's constant rants about Lina and her high-maintenance glamour lifestyle, and even though he could tell when his best friend was acting under the flashing lights, he never thought anything could ever hurt him more some nights when he saw them together. Don's hand on the small of her back, her clinging to his arm like she needed him to keep him on her feet. Hollywood is all a show, all a sham, all a big smoke 'n' mirrors, razzle dazzle fake, he'd remind himself, over and over again. Lina's hand in his meant nothing. His arm around her meant nothing. He would grasp hold of these truths and try to keep his head, even as he watched Don become Hollywood's biggest star. Sure, Don still thought Lina was a prissy diva. Sure, they still laughed at it together. Sure. But he saw the way Don played the crowds at the premieres. He saw that gleam in his eye. He knew, an epiphany he'd reached somewhere in the middle of their new, break-neck adventure, that he was never destined for what Don was always going to be: a true star. They'd been in it together. But it was Don's dream. And he slid right into place, complete with the blonde starlet on his arm. Cosmo was just along for the ride. Looking back, he remembers the times just before as the best times of his life. He was a musician, Don was a stuntman, they were finally doing it, finally getting somewhere after years of sharing cheap rooms and getting laughed and booed off stages and slipping apples and crackers into their pockets at stores when they went to buy food for one meal that would need to last them the week. And there were women then, of course. Don's looks transcended his starving artist status. But those women didn't matter. They came and went. Don forgot most of their names. There was a sort of easy security Cosmo felt, even if it didn't quite stop the waves of relief when the girls left. And very, very rarely, there were moments. The night they were sitting at the train station, after the last train had pulled out, decided their next step, and Don just ended up laughing when they couldn't agree, grabbed the back of Cosmo's neck, and said, 'It's going to be this way forever, Cosmo. Just you and me, bumming around, chasing a dream that'll never happen.' The night a pair of blonde twins simultaneously threw their drinks in the boys' faces, and they ended up leaving the bar, going back to their tiny room, and laughing about it all night. The time Cosmo had to practically drag Don up the stairs to a different room, yank off his shoes, and start to put him to bed, before Don unexpectedly grabbed the front of Cosmo's waistcoat, and pulled him into his lips, muttering something in between kisses about 'always' and 'there for me'. Cosmo thought nothing could hurt more than seeing Don with Lina. The other women came and went. Lina was this horrible, twisted constant, an Alice Through the Looking Glass version of star-crossed love. And no matter how much Don complained about her, no matter how much Cosmo told himself that it was all just Hollywood, all just an act, he still couldn't take seeing Don's hand on her back, her arm through his arm, couldn't take Don's acted little insinuations to the press and the fan magazines, because sex sells, and so does romance. The doubt and the jealousy, both so insidious, both so subtle, always found a way to creep in and eat at him from the inside. So he made his outward demeanour a shield built of corny jokes and slapstick comedy. It was already such a part of who he was, no one would ever notice if he was just a little too cheerful, just a little too happy. Not even Don. And then one day, out of nowhere, there was Kathy. Kathy, who blew a hole right through Don's ego and film star facade, and reminded him of who he really was. Kathy, who planted herself so firmly in Don's head that he couldn't shake her for anything, that he was constantly looking for her, constantly wondering where she and what she was doing. Kathy, with the ridiculous laugh and that personality that blew so hot and cold, so whimsical and then so no-nonsense in the same breath. Don and Cosmo had shared everything since they were four years old. Why shouldn't they share the same love for Kathy as well? The more he saw Kathy, the more he felt himself becoming trapped in a web he knew he couldn't untangle himself from. She was fresh air after the stifling cloud of perfume that was Hollywood. She was beautiful, talented, and smart, but most of all, she never let her compromised her opinions or principles for show biz. And Cosmo never felt like he was walking on eggshells around her. Looking back, he realised it was when she hit Lina in the face with the pie meant for Don that he'd first fallen in love. Cosmo knew from the get-go that it was a lost cause. Don had set his eye on something. And when he saw them together, for the first time after the pie disastre, whatever he'd thought before of Don's fantastic stories of the girl whose car he'd jumped into that night, he knew. She'd fallen for Don just as hard as he'd fallen for her. The tensing in his stomach was back, with a vengeance. And this time there was no relief to follow. Kathy was Don's. And Don was Kathy's. And Cosmo knew that. So he pulled on his cheery face. He was funny, he was silly, and he made 'em laugh. It was the only way he knew how to be. When he watched Kathy and Don kiss in celebration of his own idea for The Dancing Cavalier, he felt that kiss like a bullet tearing through his chest, so he pretended to pout, and hoped his feelings didn't come through. And when she turned and kissed him, with her girlish grin and her lighthearted, 'Oh Cosmo,' all he could do was play the fool and fall back on the couch, trying to bury the storm of conflicting feelings inside, even as it killed him. So eventually Cosmo Brown found out what could hurt more than watching Don with Lina Lamont. Even as he directed the orchestra in their pit and Don ran down the aisle after Kathy, he finally realised that watching the two people who he'd ever loved together was the most exquisite pain in the world. Because even while he was sharing their happiness at having found each other, his heart was breaking. ","Summary":" Cosmo remembers the set-up.

The cavernous ballroom overflowed with a glittering crowd, reflected in the huge chandelier glittering back at them. Don Lockwood felt stifled. He'd spotted Kathy across the room. Lina hadn't noticed her—thank heaven Lina never noticed anything outside her own circle—but let Don get anywhere near her, and gossip would spread until even Lina couldn't miss it. And though Kathy's star was on the rise, Lina Lamont still had the power to make her life hell, given the chance. Don couldn't let that happen—not least because the whole mess was his own fault. Discretion was key. So he lingered circumspectly near Lina's group, watching Kathy talk and laugh, and occasionally telegraph him a message with her eyes or her smile. Each glance was just one more straw hitting the camel's back. Social gatherings with Kathy might be impossible, but social gatherings without her were flatter than last week's glass of champagne. Impulsively, Don grabbed Cosmo's shoulder and whispered something. His friend chuckled, saluted, and headed into the crowd. He loved doing things that would get Lina's goat if she knew about them. Don checked to make sure the blonde's attention was diverted, before retreating to the corridor. He was waiting there when the door opened and Kathy stood silhouetted by the brilliant light from the ballroom. Her eyebrows lifted and she laughed. \"Phone call, huh?\" she teased, shutting the door carefully behind her. Don just grinned. \"May I have this dance?\" She slipped into his arms and rested her head on his shoulder. They danced in blissful silence for a moment before cheers from the ballroom signaled midnight. Leaning down for the first kiss of the new year, Don decided he'd never been to a better party.

I really wish he didn't look so good in that leathernjacket. Or that he didn't smell so good. Wait… since when didnSpike give me the warm and fuzzy feelings? Oh… hang on… Inactually kind of… I want to kiss him. \"Let go of mynphone.\" \"Kiss me.\" \"Go to hell.\" \"Nah, cause thennI'd take you with me. And the phone too. Cause I ain't lettingngo.\" \"Jerk.\" \"You usually usenbigger words when you insult me. I'm hurt.\" \"Ignoramus.\" \"Much better.\" I'm now startingnto notice that he's got me backed up into the truck. And that he'snpushed up against me. I can't breath and those butterflies I wasntalking about have now employed some kind of heart pounding gremlins.n Cause I'm pretty sure that Junior might be able to hear minenleaping out of my chest, while he spray-paints one up on the waterntower. So maybe I like Spike. A tiny little bit. His lips are a lotncloser to mine than before. Something in me still wants to punchnhim, just for being arrogant. \"I swear I'mngonna knee you so hard you'll be singing soprano for the rest ofnyour miserable life,\" I promise, \"And it's going to be a shortnpainful life too.\" \"Least I'll dienhappy.\" \"You'll die aneunuch.\" \"Whatever thatnmeans.\" Okay, so I likenhim. Anything wrong with that? I mean besides the fact that we'venbeen fighting nonstop since we hit puberty. When did he let go of mynphone? I didn't notice he had until his hand isn't holding itnanymore. It's gone and slid up to my cheek, running his thumbnalong my bottom lip. Now I'm wishing he would hurry up and lean innfurther. But there's still that stupid stubborn part that wants tondo anything to get away from whatever it is causing all the new heartnpounding type feelings. There's anscrambling metallic sound as Junior tumbles down the ladder. And thensound of a car crunching the gravel. I narrow my eyes and glare atnSpike. \"I didn't!\"nhe stammers. \"Shit!\" Junior jumps thenthree feet into the bed of the truck. \"Toss me thenpaint!\" Spike barks. He tosses Junior mynphone in a switch. \"Tell them younsaw me up here… came to get Becky's phone. You stay here.\" henpoints at me. \"Yeah I'dnfollow your dumb ass out here. Right. I'm coming with you.\" \"What? No! I'mngetting caught!\" \"On purpose?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Idiot.\" I sawnand grab his hand. \"New plan. I run with you. Junior stays herenand tells them you ran that way. We run the other way.\" Junior smiles atnme. He knows what I'm thinking. If both of us are there thisnwasn't an impromptu thing. If it's the both of us… somethingnelse was going on. \"But…\" Spike And I'm alreadyndragging him behind me before anyone can argue any more. At the endnof the gravel road that starts up the hill, he's trying to go leftnand I'm trying to go right, towards the barn on the edge of myndad's property. \"Becky! We havento go this way!\" Spike says. He's gulping air. Stupid boynthought he ran faster than me. Yeah, right. \"No. They'dncatch you that way. We hide in the barn till Junior comes.\" \"How do younknow.\" I hold up my phone. \"Did younseriously send a text while running from the cops?\" \"Yep.\" \"That'snridiculous.\" \"I'm talented. nWe're hiding in the barn.\" \"But…\" \"How many timenhave you gotten caught and I'm just supposed to trust you?\" \"Good point. Butncould we slow down a little?\" \"Race you.\" \"What do I get ifnI win?\" \"You won't.\" I take off beforenhe answers. Full out sprint. I'm not stopping to see if henfollowed me. Cause if he did… I'm not losing. Not to Spike. nWeather I like the kid or not. Both of my apparently proud selvesncan guarantee that. I can hear him behind me. He sounds prettynclose. But I learned one thing really fast in races with Junior andnthe guys, you turn your head and you slow down. The second thing isnthat they stare too easy sometimes. That's the advantage of havingnboobs. Automatic distraction. I can't look… Incan't I can't I can't. I keep telling myself. My self is annidiot. She doesn't listen. I turn my head and see him two stepsnbehind and speeding up fast. My lungs are on fire. My legs atnaching and my feet are screaming for me to stop. I can not lose tonSpike. I can't think. Just run.[Chapter 2] AN: Look! I did it! Yay for updates! Thanks to those that reviewed! Oh and MsLessa…nhe's painting a white on white heart with \"Sarah\" underneathnit. It's supposed to be cute. My friend came up with that part. nI can't even blame drunken boredom or plot bunnies. It's allnAsh's fault. And really it is… cause she made me watch Acceptednagain. And I said… \"OMFG! That's Spike!\" Disclaimer: I ownnnothing! I swear it was justngoing to be one kiss. At least I'm pretty sure that's what Inthough. It was a really close race, and he's got these dark eyes. nThey suck all the light out of the room and shut off my higher brainnfunctions. So I kissed him. Because my brain wasn't working, andnthen it apparently went on strike all together. Because he kissednback. Nothing really happened. Junior called my phone to give us thenall clear, and sent me jumping backwards. Spike held onto menthough, his hands around my middle. He'd pulled me closer ,nnuzzling into my neck. We stayed in that barn way longer than wenneeded to. It turns out that Spike is a really good kisser. Andnwhen he's out of breath and whispers my name it makes me feel likenI'm going to melt. And I like it. Now I'm backednagainst a stack of hay bales, there are hands in places therenshouldn't be and my arms are wrapped tightly around him. My phonenis ringing again. I can't be bothered to pick it up. It's onnanother planet. Spike stops kissing, leans his forehead on mine. \"Bec, the phone.\" \"S'ringing.\" \"Yeah. You couldnanswer it. And then you could go. I wouldn't tell anybody.\" \"What that Ininterrupted making out to answer my cell?\" I giggle. Thoughts arenslowly coming back and making sense again. No more of this impulse,ngasp when he bites my lip, weak feeling legs, I don't want to stopnthoughts. Now I'm starting to wonder why he looks sad suddenly. nAnd why he's promising not to tell anyone. \"No… that younwere here. You know. With me.\" \"Oh.\" And I'mncold. It's the beginning of summer , muggy and sticky. And I'mnshivering in his arms. I didn't know I wanted to be here until Inwas. My stupid phone switches over to voicemail and is silent. Inwant to go back to kissing but he leans away from me a little. \"You won't tellnanyone?\" I ask slowly. My ears must be playing tricks on my brain.n Evil bad ears. \"No.\" Ears are still evilnbut were apparently correct. \"Hello?\" Inanswer the phone, which has started ringing again. Junior tells menthat the cops were there, and bought his story. We can go home. Forna second I try and think of why they would buy that stupid story. nBut then Spike pulls away. Now he looksnconfused. Like he's dizzy. And I know how it feels. He'd beennpressed up against me, every possible body part glued to mine. Andnnow we were separated, trying to find our balance. \"I won't tellnanybody. So you know…\" he starts. \"Whatever.\" Insnap. I grab my hoodie from the bale it was thrown onto and startnheading home.[Chapter 3] AN: This story is coming in spurts and I love it. I own nothing but myncomputer which I use to write. I could not for thenlife of me remember the name of Becky's cousin. I think it mightnhave been Karen but I'm not sure. To all that this annoys… bowsnhead + praying hands Apologies. Terribly sorry it took me this longnmy dears. Another story got stuck in my head and needed out first. nBut here it is. \"Beeeeecky!\" nKaren squeals. \"Ohhhhhhhhhhh my god!\" My cousin is anmoron. A cheerleading, bleach blonde, gum cracking moron. And onnsome level I love her. Most days I can muster a little bit ofnexcitement and pretend to be interested in what she babbles at me. nToday… not so much. \"Seriously, Inheard from Elisha, who heard from Jake, cause he saw you in studynhall, but wait… no Katie heard from Elisha. So who gave it tonyou?\" she says all in one breath, \"Cause I bet it was Mark butnthen Katie said that it wasn't cause he's with Emily. So who didnit?\" \"Who did what, nKaren?\" I ask, shaking my head. She was talking at warp speed so Inonly caught half of what she said. \"Your neck.\" \"What about mynneck?\" \"Hmmm.\" Shensays back. She's got this look on her face like she knowsneverything already. \"Seriously, Inthink some of that bleach leaked into your brain.\" I shrug andnturn back to my chemistry homework. \"As if. I'm aunnatural.\" \"Right.\" \"I use the hairncoloring that has herbs in it! Seriously Becky! Who did it? Comenon. I'm dying here!\" she whines. \"Please tell me?\" Sometimes in steadnof loving my cousin I want to throw her through a window. I smile atnthe mental picture, and then pull my hood up to hide the evidencenthat I don't in fact, run faster than Spike. I've been tryingnto get it out of my head all weekend. And it hasn't been working. nNow it's Monday, and I'm stuck. Because the evidence of saidnSpike being a good kisser, as well as my own nonfunctioning brain isnclearly marked on my neck, just above my shoulder. And my cousin wasnnow sitting across the lunch table from me, going out of her tinynmind bothering me about it. \"I don't knownwhat you're talking about.\" I shrug. Thankfully, the newngirl/Junior's new girlfriend Sarah, comes strolling up to ourntable. \"Hi, Beckerton!\"n She smile, \"You guys mind if I sit?\" \"Ummm yeah wendo.\" Karen rolls her eyes, \"Emos have they're own table. Awaynform the sharp utensils.\" \"Sit on it andnrotate, Barbie.\" Sarah snaps. Sarah for thenrecord is not Emo. But anyone in our school who wears more than onenpiece of black clothing is labeled as such, seeing as it's trendynto either be one or make fun of them. I pick up my books and thenrest of my lunch. \"Let's go sitnon a bench in the court yard.\" I shrug at Sarah. She rewards me withna huge grin and links an arm tough mine. Karen is glaring at ournbacks, when Junior falls into step next to his girlfriend. I let gonof Sarah so that she can hold his hand and not feel weird, and whennwe get out to the courtyard they sit together on one bench, while Infinish my chemistry homework on another. I'm trying reallynhard not to notice two things. One, my brother currently kissing hisngirlfriend and that is something I seriously don't need to see. nAnd two, I can tell Spike is staring at me from the doorway to thencourtyard. He's leaning against the wall with the two friends he'snbeen able to keep, smoking and laughing. Anger boils up in my chestnmaking it hard to breath. I really want to punch that stupid smilenright off his face.[Chapter 4] AN: Taaaa-Daaaa! An update! Sorry it took so long. Work… trying tonhave a social life. It gets hard to even let my brain wander offninto writing land. But no more than a month for the next chapter. Inpromise. I'm really starting to love my plot bunnies for this one.n Even if there isn't much of a point to this chapter… it'snpretty randomly written actually. Cousin's name has been fixed. Disclaimer:nI own nothing!!… and I love reviews! Thenbell rings, calling us inside. Spike and his jerk friends are somenof those guys who just stand around in the middle of the doorway,nexpecting you to walk around them. Seeing as I'm already mad atnhim, and I'm glaring daggers in his direction; Spike throws hisncigarette on the ground and shoves his friends inside. \"Funny…nhe didn't taste like smoke.\" the traitorous, girly side of my brain thinks. I'm kicking myselfnfor letting that thought slip in. Now on top of dealing with Debbienbeing mad at me, I have to let that stupid thought get my \"mad atnhim\" feeling all confused. Like I wasn't confused enoughnalready. I didn't even think I liked him. And then he had to gonand be a jerk and kiss me. Or the other way around. Cause he kissednme and then he was a jerk when he didn't want anyone to know. Indon't even want to look at him anymore let alone think about him. nFine then I hate him again. At least that isn't confusing. Unfortunatelynfor me, his locker is six or seven down from mine across the hall. nSo we start heading the same way once we get into the building. AndnI kind of have to look at him since he's leaning on the one next tonmine. I almost smack him with the door, grabbing my books, andntrying to get away. But I can't find my note book for Mrs. Robin'snclass. \"Becks?\" I'mnignoring him. I am. I'm not going to look. Just keep digging tonfind the physics notes. Not going to look. Not not not…so notngoing to look at him. \"Becky?n What did I do?\" \"Nothing.\"n I snap. So maybe I'm not ignoring him. But I'm still notnlooking at him. I've learned one thing with having four year oldnsiblings. You do not look at the sad face. And something tells menthat Spike with a sad face on could kill me. I'm glad he's onnthe wrong side of the open door. \"Butnyou're all pissed off at me.\" his voice is kind of pitifulnreally. If I wasn't mad at him I might be concerned. Wait! No Inwouldn't! I hate Spike! \"Notnpissed off. Just normal run of the mill I hate you kind of thing.\" \"That'snall?\" \"Wellnthat and I can't find my damned notes for physics.\" I shrug,nwondering when it got so easy to talk to him… and when I stoppednhating him again. Because I can't even see the sad face and it'snkilling me. I can hear it in his voice. And I'm done for. Backnto the confusing I like him and he's a jerk. And the being mad atnmyself for getting into this with Spike of all people. Henmoves and opens the locker further, seeing as the hallway has clearednand I'm already late, I guess it doesn't matter if his jerknfriends see us. Because they aren't there. He leans in towardsnme, reaches into my backpack, tucking in a note book. \"Younstole my notes?\" I glare at him. \"Borrowed.n With every intention of giving them back. And I have. So borrowednthen retuned.\" he says. \"Thenhomework was in there.\" \"Borrowednthat too.\" \"Jerk.\" Thenreally pathetic thing is, with that look on his face I'm not surenif I wouldn't have just handed over the homework if he'd asked. I'mnmore mad at myself than him at the moment, so I turn around and startnwalking to physics. \"Wannagotoamovieorsomething?\"n He says as he falls into step next to me. I'mntrying to ignore him again. \"Nope.n Try one of Debbie's friends. They'll love the bad boy thing.\"nI shrug and try to ignore the hurt look on his face when I say no. \"Indon't wanna date one of your cousin's friends.\" \"Wellnwhat am I supposed to do about it?\" \"Gonto a movie with me.\" he grins. And there it is again. That stupidnhopeful little sad puppy face. I hate that look. Just on principal Inshould not want to go out with him. Right? So, no I won't go to anmovie with stupid Spike. \"Fine.\"nI shrug. Wait a second! Stupid girly brain! I ment to say no…ndidn't I? He's grinning like a moron again. So am I. Shit whenndid this change from kind of liking the guy into the whole \"I can'tnstop smiling thing?\". Junior is already sending looks at my necknand making the whole moody pout face. Seeing as he knows who thenonly person that could have possibly given me a hickey over thenweekend was. \"Cool.n I snagged your number when I borrowed your phone. I'll call younafter I get out of detention.\" \"Cool.\"n and that's all I have time to say, when the bell rings again andnSpike leans in a pecks me on the cheek. He's gone off to class andnI'm walking on air into Robin's class. When I sit down next tonDebbie her jaw is on the floor. ","Summary":" AN : It leaptnout of my brain! It isn't my fault I swear. I blame my plotnbunnies a drunken boredom"},{"Movie":"Singin' in the Rain","Title":"Singin' in the Rain (Another Story)","Author":"Tookish Fool","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13083490","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The first thing Kathy saw after she jumped out of that giant cake was Don Lockwood's stupid face, grinning devilishly at her. She was petrified, a chill running through her as she remembered the events that happened earlier, that same night. \"Well, if it isn't Ethel Barrymore!\" He mocked her, also amazed by the coincidence. That same night, he jumped into her car while trying to escape from his fans, and after recognizing who it was, Kathy decided to give him a ride. However, they didn't have a nice conversation after that, which resulted in Kathy insulting the actor, so she was hoping she wouldn't have to see him again. She was a big fan of his, and she felt ashamed by how she acted. Kathy stared at him speechless until the music started playing, reminding her she was there to dance. The actor helped her out of the dessert, and she joined the other Coconut Grove girls. Not wanting to miss an opportunity, and much to the young woman's dismay, the actor followed her. \"I do hope you'll favor us with something special.\" Don continued to mock her; Kathy tried to ignore him and focus on the guests. \"Say, Hamlet's soliloquy...\" ...She was now starting to realize that the dreamy actor Donald Lockwood wasn't the kind of person she had imagined he was. \"Please.\" She stopped at a corner. \"Or the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet?\" \"Listen-\" Don shushed her. \"Don't be shy, you'd make about the prettiest Juliet I've ever seen.\" He smiled slyly, and Kathy didn't know whether that was a compliment or not. However, before she could think in a comeback, the music signaled she had to run to the other girls to start their 'All I Do is Dream of You' dance number. When they finished it, Kathy attempted to leave but Don stopped her once more. \"I just had to tell you how good you were.\" \"Excuse me!\" Kathy said, attempting to leave, but the actor kept blocking her way. \"No, no, no, don't go! Now that I know where you live, I'd like to see you home.\" Don pointed at the cake Kathy had jumped off. ...Out of all cars, why did he have to jump into hers? \"Now listen, Mr. Lockwood-\" She started, but was interrupted by a high-pitched, strident voice. Kathy was surprised to see that annoying voice belonged to Lina Lamont, Don's co-actress. She always looked so impeccable in the pictures, so Kathy would never have guessed she actually had such a screechy voice, with a weird intonation - however, a certain actor didn't let her have much time to ponder about Lina's voice. \"Say! Who is this dame anyway?\" Lina asked. \"Someone lofty and far above us all,\" Don said, referring to what Kathy had told him during the car ride about theater being superior to motion pictures. \"She couldn't learn anything from the movies. She's an actress on the legitimate stage.\" That was the last straw. Kathy wanted to go home and didn't want to stand any more of Don Lockwood's mockery, so she grabbed the first thing within her reach — a cake with strawberry topping. \"Here's one thing I've learned from the movies!\" she said. She threw the dessert, hoping to hit Don, but he dodged it; the cake hit Lina's face instead. The two stayed silent for some seconds, not knowing what to do or say — until the actress started screaming. \"I'll kill her!\" Lina yelled but Don held her back, giving Kathy an opportunity to run, which she did. \"She was aiming at me!\" Don tried to reason with the actress, who was hysterically trying to get free from his grasp. \"You never looked lovelier!\" Don's best friend and childhood friend, Cosmo Brown, appeared, amused by the commotion. Lina looked pretty ridiculous with white and pink whipped cream covering her face. He didn't have a good relationship with her — neither Don or he did — so it felt satisfying seeing her like that. \"It was an accident,\" Don said. \"It happens to me six times a day!\" Cosmo joked. Don suddenly looked around, realizing Kathy was missing. \"Where is... Cos, go after her!\" he yelled. \"Her who?\" the pianist asked, at a loss. \"That girl!\" With his head, he pointed at the direction Kathy had run off to. \"I need to calm Lina down!\" \"Which girl, at least tell me her name!\" Cosmo started panicking, quickly noticing by his best friend's voice that it was something important. \"Selden!\" Don's voice became more impatient, so Cosmo hurried up. The pianist ended up entering the Coconut Grove Girls' changing room, and they all squeaked when he suddenly opened the door. Thankfully, they were all still fully dressed. He had to admit he felt like a creep as he didn't even exactly know who he was looking for — he just thought about having some laughs when he saw Lina's face was covered with cake topping, yet suddenly he was at a dressing room belonging to ladies — but hey, it was a favor for his best friend, so it was for a good cause, right? He surely hoped so if Don was going to make him play the goofy. \"Ehhmm... Excuse me, is miss S-Selden here?\" he asked. \"She grabbed her things and bolted. Could you leave now? We're trying to get changed,\" one of the girls said with indifferently. That was the curse of being nothing more than a famous actor's best friend - everyone went nuts when they saw Mr. Lockwood, but as for the humble pianist Mr. Brown, he was a nobody who didn't even deserve respect - not that Cosmo was bothered by that. \"U-uh. Thanks. I'm sorry. Uh, it's an emergency, my best friend's life is at stake,\" Cosmo stuttered, before clumsily running to the back door. When he left the building, Kathy was already driving away. \"Miss Selden! Miss Selden! Wait, Don wants to talk to you!\" As soon as Kathy heard the actor's name, she decided to ignore whoever was calling for her, so she just stepped on the gas pedal. \"Hey!\" Cosmo ran to the middle of the street and watched her car until it vanished into the night. He stood there for a moment, wondering who she was and what the hell had happened between her and his best friend to the point she left like that. ...Then he remembered he failed that same best friend. The pianist sighed, looking back at the building, where the actor was expecting him to be back with that Selden girl. \"Don's going to kill me...\" (A/N) I think I'll be adding traits of Melvin's from I Love Melvin, another of Donald O'Connor's roles, in Cosmo's personality. I Love Melvin was my inspiration for this AU, since I think Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds make a cute on-screen couple. Anyway, I hope you like it! I know this chapter is literally the events of the film, but it'll differ in future chapters, promise![Chapter 2] Don didn't get mad as Cosmo thought he'd get, actually, he was... Bothered, if that was the word the pianist could even use to describe it. For the past two weeks, Don would keep on babbling a thing or two about that girl from the party, how he was now feeling ashamed of the way he treated her during the party, and he'd try asking his co-workers for info about her. Cosmo found it quite amusing how the great Don Lockwood was head over heels in love with this girl but was also worried about him. The pianist did his best to help with the search for the girl but was hoping they'd find her soon, or Don would forget about her soon - whichever happened first. Then one day - he found her. They were filming the 'Beautiful Girl' number, and she was one of the dancers. Cosmo couldn't really recognize her at first since that night he had only seen a glimpse of her profile, but then it hit him hard. So THAT was the dame Don was looking for! And she wasn't half bad, Cosmo had to admit. Wait, what kind of thought was that? Cosmo shook his head - he was probably thinking weird stuff because Don's constant talking about that girl infected his mind. ...Speaking of Don, he had better call him. - A Few Moments Later - \"Hey, that's Kathy! Kathy Selden!\" Don ran to her, interrupting whatever conversation she was having with R. F. Simpson. However, she ignored him and tried trying to get out of there as quick as possible. \"That's okay.\" The tone of her voice became very bitter, Cosmo noticed. Don must've done something really rude to her, and the pianist couldn't help but wonder what it was. \"Now, before Mr. Lockwood refreshes your memory...\" She threw an accusing glare at the actor. \"I was the one who hit Lina Lamont with the cake, but it was meant for Mr. Lockwood!\" Cosmo knew he needed to keep a straight face, but he wanted to laugh - so that's what happened! \"Goodbye. I'm sorry. I should've told you.\" That girl, Kathy, now looked pitiful, as if she had missed the biggest opportunity in her life. She tried to leave, but Don blocked her way. \"What is this all about? What's happening, R. F.?\" Don asked. \"We were going to use her in a picture, but if that'll make Lina and you unhappy...\" \"Unhappy!\" Don interrupted the man, grinning. \"I think it'll be wonderful!\" \"Sure, he's been looking for her for weeks.\" Cosmo thought it was the best time to butt in. \"Are you speaking for Lina also?\" \"Look, the Coconut Grove's owner may work for Lina, but you're the head of this studio.\" Don said, trying to convince him, and apparently, it worked, as R. F. agreed to hire Kathy, as long as they didn't tell Lina. The young lady thanked him before he left. \"Gee, I'm really glad you turned up. We've looked inside every cake in town.\" Cosmo made another one of his unnecessary comments. Don and Kathy smiled at each other, not paying attention to him, and Cosmo thought it was a good time to leave the two lovebirds alone. However, before he could even leave the place, Kathy ran off somewhere. Don attempted to go after her, but hesitated, stopping at Cosmo's side, sighing. \"Don, if ya keep scaring dames like that then you won't get anywhere.\" The pianist rolled his eyes. \"I didn't say anything this time.\" Don looked miserable at Cosmo's attempt to be funny. \"She didn't even give me time to apologize, she just... left.\" \"Oh. Guess your charm's not working on this specific girl. You're getting rusted, Don.\" They stayed in silence for some moments, Don apparently ignoring Cosmo's second attempt to be funny. The pianist was a bit too slow to notice his best friend was plotting something and got caught off guard when Don grabbed his shoulders, turning him around so that he was staring at the actor's eyes. \"Ya got to convince her what a nice guy I am, Cos!\" Cosmo stood there, staring at Don's face like he didn't understand it. \"Sorry? I... I didn't really catch that. What did ya say?\" \"If she won't talk to me, then ya NEED to talk to her!\" The actor begged. \"C'mon Cos, she's probably bothered about the party so she won't listen to me, I need your help! You gotta smooth-talk her!\" Ah, now he heard it. \"But Don, YOU'RE the charmer, not me!\" Cosmo complained. \"What do you expect me to do!\" \"What you always do!\" \"What? Tell jokes that were uncalled for?\" Cosmo didn't want to get caught up in this mess. He remembered the last time Don fell for a girl when they were younger and asked for Cosmo's help to win her, and... Yikes - actually, he DIDN'T want to remember what happened then. \"Don, you know you can get any girl you want at your feet, so why-\" \"C'mon Cos, I really took a liking for Kathy, she's special... This time I know is for real.\" The actor made those puppy eyes and pouty face Como didn't know were just an act or not but they never failed to make him feel sorry. He sighed, giving up. \"Alright, Don. I'll try to make her like you, at least TALK to you, but you'll be owing me one.\" Don gave him a pleased pat on the shoulder, saying something about always being able to count on his best friend or whatever, and went somewhere else, humming satisfiedly. Cosmo let out a small groan, brushing his neck nervously, regretting agreeing to the actor's plea. How was he going to make that girl start liking Don Lockwood if the real deal failed to make a good impression?

Please read and review and let me know what you think! Much love x Mr Nothing Cosmo sighed as he pulled his car to the curb, listening to it chug sadly as the valet took the keys to drive it away. It had been one week since the release of Don Lockwood's latest picture Singin' in the Rain, also starring Kathy Seldon. The duo were still inseparable, as in love as they had been during the Duelling Cavalier and almost twice as popular as the Lockwood and Lamont duo. Cosmo of course was genuinely overjoyed for his friends, secretly expecting an engagement for them any time soon. \"What's the matter, Cos?\" Don asked with genuine concern as Cosmo wandered into the hall, turning into the large room that R.F. always held his events in. A ballroom of sorts , Cosmo thought to himself, filled with the same people we always see, flaunting the same jokes and the same tricks, all discussing the picture and how they can get themselves into the next one. \"Nothing Don,\" Cosmo smiled and clapped him on the back, \"say, where is Kathy? She isn't going to pop out of the cake is she?\" \"No, nothing like that,\" Don laughed and fiddled with his cufflinks, an old habit he had picked up out of the nervousness for his first picture, \"I think she's arriving with the chorus girls, some of her old friends wanted to catch up with her.\" \"Ah yes, the lovely ladies of the Coconut Grove,\" Cosmo put on a bit of an accent and twitched his fingers up close to his face, \"dancing and singing their way into our hearts, or at lest they try to get into our hearts; they're definitely trying to get into our pictures!\" \"Oh Cos, you crack me up,\" Don chuckled and watched three or four of the girls walk in with Kathy, quickly giving his oldest friend a nudge, \"hey, why don't I get Kathy to set you up huh? I'm sure she'll know someone for ya, Cos!\" Cosmo smiled but shook his head at his friend, already anticipating the night's events and growing slightly tired. Perhaps if he stuck close enough to R.F he wouldn't have to waste any of his time talking to some pretty girl only interested in his connections, \"thanks but no thanks Don, you know me, I'm set up all single and lonely so I can write me that symphony I've been meaning to pen.\" \"Well whatever you say, but the offer will stand,\" Don smiled and turned towards the group of girls, Kathy already eyeing Don as she chatted with her friends, obviously wanting to talk to him about the success of the picture so far, \"and if you'll excuse me...\" \"Sure, no worries,\" Cosmo said to the air in front of him as Don strolled away, giant Hollywood smile on his features and white suit almost shining in the bright light of the place. Sometimes Cosmo found it hard o be friends with Don, now that he was so big and flighty in the movie circles. But despite all the flashy suits and dames Don Lockwood was and always would be his oldest friend. After all, Cos thought to himself as he watched Don an Kathy smile at each other in the most private spot they could find amongst all the people that were streaming in, it's not every guy that takes his friends with him to the top! \"Well done on the picture,\" Cosmo turned to shake hands with R.F. accustomed to the mans sudden appearances and short speeches, \"excellent work Cosmo, couldn't have done it without you!\" \"Why thanks R.F., I did do it without you, but I guess next time I should run some things by your office,\" he smiled kindly and let go of the older man's hand, watching him laugh and laughing along with him, \"seriously though it was a good project, can't wait for the next one!\" \"Ah yes, well we already have something in the works,\" R.F. was already beginning to head off, stepping to and fro on the spot and extending his hand to an investor as they passed, \"be in my office on Monday and I'll discuss it with you. Terrific work again!\" Cosmo smiled and took a step backwards, almost tripping over his own feet to avoid further collision with the shorter body he had inadvertently collided with, \"I am so sor–\" \"Oh no, really it was my fault,\" the young woman was reaching for her purse on the ground as Cosmo turned around, gaining only a glimpse of pale white skin and dark hair before she was rising to her feet, \"I thought I could duck around you quickly but obviously...\" Her voice trailed off as she looked up and found him staring at her, a tall light haired man with a lovely grey suit, hands tucked into his pockets and smile hanging slightly lopsided on his face, \"yes, obviously not. I apologise though, I should look where I'm going before I go there.\" \"Well that goes double for me I guess,\" the girl laughed and then seemed to remember herself, dark blue eyes showing the smile she wore as she took in their surroundings and gestured between them, \"anyway, I'm sorry if I've kept you from something, I'll look where I'm going for the rest of the night.\" \"No really, it was my fault, walking backwards is killer on the heels anyway,\" Cosmo felt his own smile widen as he took in the girl before him, though quite beautiful for once he seemed faced with a girl that wasn't merely interested in a movie role. As he discovered his interest he turned up the charm, leaning towards her and grinning cheekily, \"it was a pleasure running into you Ms...?\" \"Well I'm Dana,\" she smiled enthusiastically at him and offered her hand, nodding at him to take it as he shuffled a step closer, \"Dana Mercy.\" \"Well I'm certainly at yours,\" he smiled mischievously and leant further into her personal space, arm poised higher than her head against a nearby pillar of white marble, so that he had just enough support to lean down and wink at her, \"mercy, I mean. And it was a genuine pleasure running into you Ms Mercy; literally.\" She shook his hand and looked down and away from him, smiling uncomfortably at his dramatics. But with all of Don's success Cosmo determinedly kept up his position, aiming for a softer touch when she looked back towards him, cheerful again, \"and who am I speaking to?\" \"Oh, I'm Cosmo,\" he beamed at her and moved back a little, gesturing towards his chest with two thumbs, \"I'm a friend of Don Lockwood's.\" \"My sister loves his pictures,\" Dana smiled politely and then seemed to remember herself again; Cosmo was becoming charmed by the habit, \"but wait, Cosmo what? What's your last name?\" Cosmo leant his back against the pillar and turned his head towards her, matching her height with his slouch as he settled into his usual habits, \"last name? Maybe I don't have one.\" \"Don't have-?\" Dana moved from the pillar to look at him incredulously, smile still on her face, \"but how can you not have one? That's impossible! Nobody would know what to call you.\" \"Impossible?\" Cosmo gave a shocked expression and leapt away from the pillar, hand held dramatically to his heart, \"Oh dear lord you have forsaken this girl. Impossible! Nothing is impossible,\" he grinned at her as she laughed and held one arm out to his side theatrically, \"not where I work anyway. We take people off the street, send them back in time, teach monkeys how to talk, talkers how to dance, and then dancers how to act like monkeys!\" \"Sounds wonderful,\" he listened to Dana laugh and smiled to himself, watching her place her hands behind her back and walk over to him, \"and where is it you work Mr Nothing?\" \"Well well, Mr Nothing, am I now?\" he crossed his arms and smiled at her attitude, enjoying the way her enthusiasm seemed undeterred and revelling in a woman who could hold her own in a conversation, instead of simpering at him for some kind of favour. Her lips turned up slightly in the corners making her look as if she was always smiling, and Cosmo noticed the beauty of her as she turned to brush away a strand of hair. As she turned back to look at him Cosmo noticed that she was genuinely shy, and giving her a large grin, decided he definitely liked this broad. \"Well what else do you call a man whose last name is... nothing?\" \"I suppose you have a point, Ms Mercy,\" she smiled shyly again as he spoke, and elegantly he gestured towards a wall which they walked to, \"we sure could use someone like you over at Monumental Pictures. That's where I work you see; Mr Cosmo Nothing, head of the Music Department!\" \"Why Mr Nothing that's wonderful!\" Dana smiled and turned to lean against the wall, looking up at Cosmo through her eyelashes as he did the same, \"and friends with Mr Lockwood too, one wonders how you'd ever have time to talk to someone like me.\" \"Oh, I think anybody would make time for you Ms Mercy,\" he smiled down at her and tucked his hands into the pockets of his suit pants, watching Don and Kathy as they spoke to some of the guys and gals from their new picture, looking back to Dana in what was becoming a genuine moment, and one of the best conversations he's had all day, \"I certainly would.\" \"Well I'm glad,\" Dana smiled softly and Cosmo almost audibly gulped, suddenly nervous as the lights began to dim in the room around them, and Dana turned towards him as if to say something, \"because you know, I–\" \"Attention everybody,\" Cosmo bit the inside of his lip as Dana turned towards the front of the room, Don's voice ringing throughout the space as Kathy stood happily to his side. Of course his moment would be interrupted by Don, \"Kathy and I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone for coming tonight, to celebrate the release of our newest picture Singin' in the Rain .\" Cosmo stood with his arms crossed, leaning against the wall as the crowd applauded, smiling at Dana as she turned excitedly to look at him. The rest of the speech seemed lost to Cosmo as he watched the woman before him, dark hair perfectly curled against her head and fashioned in a tight up-do on the back of her head. Her slim figure was complimented by the pale blue dress she wore, and her pale skin seemed to glow with her excitement as she clapped along with the crowd during all their cues. \"Oh wasn't it wonderful!\" Dana chimed excitedly at him as he applauded the final word and the lights rose back on, \"one of the most wonderful musicals I've ever seen. And that Mr Lockwood seems awfully nice.\" \"Oh he's a card alright,\" Cosmo said quietly as he held back his frustration at their conversation being interrupted before, \"but I am partial to the movie.\" \"Oh my, I just realised,\" Dana covered her mouth quickly and shook her head, holding back laughter at her own forgetfulness, \"you must have done all the music! Why, Cosmo it was lovely.\" Cosmo blushed and put a hand to the back of his neck, rubbing at his hair as he looked at the ground, \"Why thank you, but Dana, what were you going to say before?\" \"Before?\" her smile fell from her face to be replaced by a look of concentration as her fingers gripped at her own chin as she tried to remember, \"oh let me see, we were talking about something...\" \"Dana!\" Cosmo raised his eyes to the sky and smacked his head against the wall as Dana turned away from him again, this time to the calls of a young woman as she made her way across the room in a similar styled pink dress, \"Dana the party is almost over, I think we should head home.\" Dana turned to Cosmo and then back to the girl, making to protest but quieting down as the woman indicated the time, \"Oh I guess you're right, I'll meet you outside.\" \"Alright,\" the woman looked pointedly at Cosmo and then back to Dana, disapproval spread all across her features, \"I'll give you five minutes.\" The woman wove her way back into the crowd, right past Don whom Cosmo turned away from and shadowed his face, trying not to be spotted and pulled away too early himself, \"she certainly seemed stern.\" \"Oh it's not her fault,\" Dana smiled a bit sadly at Cosmo as he turned back to give her his full attention, Don seemingly looking for him in the other direction, \"and I don't mind, I don't really enjoy these things usually.\" \"Why not?\" Cosmo had never really met a girl at these parties that hadn't been there to enjoy herself or find her way into acting somehow, \"are you opposed to a little bit of fun?\" \"Why Mr Nothing, you aren't accusing me of being boring are you?\" She held a hand to her heart as she looked at him, mock offended as he held his hands up in front of him in surrender, smiling, \"I assure you I have fun. Just not really at these parties, you're probably the first gentleman who hasn't offered to get me into a movie or play... as a way of getting other things anyway.\" \"I wouldn't have dreamed of it,\" Cosmo smiled again, secretly congratulating himself on the fact he had gone with another tactic tonight, \"I really am glad I met you Dana Mercy.\" Dana beamed and then looked at her feet, raising her gaze to meet his and say something just as the woman from before appeared once again, calling her name, \"Dana, we have to go, I've got the car waiting outside!\" \"Sorry,\" she smiled sadly at Cosmo as he moved forward to take her hand, just missing her as she stepped back and turned to go, \"it was wonderful meeting you. Mr Nothing.\" \"But I don't have your number,\" Cosmo said to her retreating figure, well aware that by now the noise of the departing crowd would have downed him out, \"Miss Mercy.\" \"Ms Who?\" Don Lockwood patted his best friend on the back, finally locating him against the back wall of the room, partly concealed by the shadow of a giant white marble pillar, \"what are ya doin' Cos? I've barely seen you all night!\" \"Nowhere Don, just listening to your speeches, very well timed as usual,\" Cosmo let out the sarcasm and sighed, looking at his friend as his arm left his shoulder to fix his cufflinks, \"congrats on the movie though. You and Cathy are gonna be big! Bigger than Lina's ego ever was!\" \"Well we hope so,\" Don laughed, Cosmo's earlier comment not phasing him in the slightest, \"come on Cos, we have to go, Kathy is waiting for us with some of the chorus girls outside.\" \"Sure thing buddy,\" Cosmo let his friend guide him through the crowd with a hand on his shoulder, politely greeting both Kathy and the chorus girls as they arrived outside, all the while thinking about Dana Mercy.[Chapter 2] A/N: Sorry for the long absence and lack of posting, hope you enjoy this chapter, it's mainly a filler for the next which will be posted shortly as I'm on break for Easter. That being said there is a lot of Cosmo in this chapter, and a lot of action to establish relationships between our favourite music director, Kathy and Don. Hope you enjoy, much love x (The disclaimer from the first chapter applies to this whole fic) Mr Nothing \"Cosmo? Cosmo, what's the matter with you?\" Kathy turned from the papers she was shuffling at the table next to Cosmo's piano and glanced at the man briefly, \"I'm sure you haven't heard a word I've said all morning.\" \"Kathy, that's not true,\" Cosmo flipped the page of the music book resting on his stand and then back towards the latest musical sensation herself, \"I distinctly remember you saying hello to me when you came in!\" \"Very funny, Cos,\" she gave a small flutter of a laugh and then lifted her now neat stack of papers, holding them to her chest and sitting lightly on the side of the table and smiling at the pianist, \"what's the matter though? Don says you've been acting distracted all week since R.F's party. Didn't you enjoy yourself?\" \"Oh of course not, this life of his class, high fun and high lifestyle is much too dull for me now,\" Cosmo spun off of his stool and jumped towards Kathy, prying her hands away from her papers and spinning her around as they fluttered to the ground at their feet, \"I don't think this nice salary and these nice clothes are for me at all. I'd much rather be turned out onto the street to beg for the change to see your next picture, my art would surely improve for it!\" Kathy laughed and leant back into a low dip before rising up and shuffling back from the musician, \"Without you Cosmo there would be no next picture.\" \"Aw, come on now!\" Cosmo pulled at his tie and smiled down at his feet a second, walking towards Kathy with his arms held out and rubbing her shoulders smiling warmly, \"Kathy you are far too nice for a woman so talented and so beautiful. You have talent enough for a million pictures with or without me.\" Kathy smiled and leant forward onto Cosmo's shoulder, rocking slowly from side to side as if they were going to dance, \"thanks, Cos.\" \"Well you're very welcome,\" Cosmo smiled as Kathy's hair rested against his cheek, holding her hand and her waist more formally as they swayed on the spot in the middle of the room, empty but for the piano and the table that stood to their right, \"hey Kathy, what made you go for a guy like Don?\" \"Oh, I don't know,\" Kathy gave a fluttering laugh and continued to sway, and Cosmo could feel her smiling against his chest, \"he was handsome and he always seemed so genuine in his interviews before I met him. When I finally did, well, through all that front the two of us put on, I could tell he was genuine underneath. I think it's like they show you in all those pictures; you feel a spark and then nothing can separate you after that, not really.\" Cosmo gave a short laugh and smiled to himself as Kathy lifted her head to look at his face, \"nothing, funny you should mention the word.\" x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x \"Okay people! Let's wrap it up from there,\" Roscoe bit his lip as the director shouted to himself in the corner, ordering people back and forwards as extras scattered quickly from the set, \"Don! Hey, Don!\" \"What can I do for you, Roscoe?\" Don flashed a winning smile as he undid the button on his gloves and pulled them off, \"what's up with Max over there? What are we cutting for?\" Roscoe twisted up his face and rubbed at the back of his neck with an absent hand, \"look Don, he isn't happy with the music we've got goin'. Can you talk to Cos for me? I think I better go calm him down.\" \"Yeah... sure thing,\" Don spared a look over his shoulder at Cosmo seated by the piano, absently flipping through his music book and writing in corrections he assumed, \"hey Ros, I'll get it sorted, don't worry about it.\" \"Thanks Don,\" Roscoe started to back away, turning to take care of Max's temper, \"say hi to Cos for me.\" Don nodded and smiled again, turning to walk towards the piano with a frown for his friend. Something wasn't right with Cosmo lately; Don just couldn't quite put his finger on it. \"Da da DI da!\" Cos sang lightly, shaking his head and making more marks on his music book, \"da da do di da.\" \"Sounds good, Cos,\" Don smiled winningly as he leant against the closed hood o the piano, watching his friend smile and nod at his own handiwork, \"whatcha cookin' up for us now?\" \"Just something for the opening credits. Thought I'd jazz 'em up a bit for the folks back home,\" Cos met Don's gaze with a smile and pushed his stool back, reclining against the table nearby, \"how's it goin' Don? Wrapping up early today, the life of a big star just gets harder and harder.\" Don smiled down at the piano and then looked up at Cos with a serious gaze, watching the grin fall from his friends face as he did so, \"yeah it does. Hey listen Cos, is there something up pal? You've been acting kind of strange lately and well... people are starting to worry about ya.\" \"Worry about me?\" Cosmo smiled as if he thought the world idiots, trailing his fingers against the length of the table as if it were a piano, \"there's nothing wrong with me Don, old Cosmo ain't crazy yet. What makes them think, anyway?\" Don flicked through the pages of Cosmo's music book and looked back towards his friend seriously for a second, \"Cos, we're filming a comedy.\" \"Yeah... so?\" \"You were playing the funeral march!\" Don held his hands out to his sides and smiled at his friend without much humour, softening his touch and returning to his original stance, \"Come on Cos, what's the matter pal? You've been down in the dumps for a while now.\" Cosmo heaved a sigh and slumped back towards his piano, running his fingers over the keys to open his tale, \"hey Don, if I ask you a question, do you promise not to make a big deal out of it?\" \"Of course, Cos! You can tell me anything,\" Don seemed to stand to attention as Cosmo continued to play the piano quietly in the background of his thoughts, \"what is it?\" \"Well...\" Cosmo looked up thoughtfully as if he could see something above his shoulder and was trying to describe it. With a simple banging of the keys, all together and out of tune, he stood to face Don, smacking him on the shoulder and gesturing about himself, \"you know how it is, Don! We spent our lives on the streets working our way up and what have we got ourselves? A nice place to live. Who cares? A nice place to work. We meet more genuine people at the cleaners! We have all the money we wanted and all the glory we ever begged God to deliver to us, and after all that I don't have a single thing I ever really wanted. How did you do it, Don? How did you go out gettin' yourself a girl like Kathy? How did you do it ? How do you tell a girl you're in love with her?\" \"Wha-?\" Don spluttered for a second and then seemed to regain his composure, watching Cosmo almost slam himself back onto his seat and mash his fingers against some of the piano keys in defeat. A smile seemed to break out across his face without permission and Don threw himself towards Cos at the front of the piano, \"Cosmo Brown are you telling me what I think you're telling me?\" \"Technically, I told you nothing,\" Cosmo grinned smugly to himself and then slumped forwards again, rubbing his hands over his face and then looking up towards Don, \"that word again. I think I'm in real trouble this time, Don.\" \"You're in love,\" Don's smile was almost predatory and Cosmo stood up with a huff, stomping around the piano until he was in the open space of the studio, edging towards the set, \"Cosmo that's brilliant! Who is she? Do I know her? I bet she's one of those chorus girls I've been seeing you with for the past few months, isn't she? You sly dog! You've gotta bring her over so I can meet her!\" \"No can do I'm afraid,\" Cosmo stood shaking his head, hands in his pockets as Don approached and circled like a bird of prey that's found its latest victim, \"you and Kathy will have to stow your romantic notions away Don. I never got her number.\" \"Never got her...\" Don seemed to fall for a second, but with a clap of his hands he was grinning again, his hand clapped fast over Cosmo's shoulder, \"well you know her name don't you? We gotta get to the operator and find her!\" Cosmo drew his hands from his pockets and turned a little to face Don, looking every bit a mess like a fool hopelessly enthralled, \"I already found her Don, but it's no use, I can't call her.\" \"Can't call her?\" Don gave Cosmo a small tap on the face and continued to stare at him, \"Cos you're in love with her! You have to call her.\" \"It's not so simple,\" the musician sighed as his friend continued to stare at him. Don always got his way by doing this, \"we met at R.F.'s party alright. She was... I dunno, Don! She was different. Not like all the others we meet around here y'know? I really liked her, Don. Her sister works here in costume that's why she's been around, but I never got a chance to get her number and I don't even know if she remembers me now, that party was a couple of weeks ago. I've left it too late, Don.\" \"Oh Cosmo, has working here taught you nothing?\" Cosmo flinched at the word but Don continued without noticing, holding out his arms and gesturing to the grandeur of the set to his Irish born friend, \"it's never too late, Cos. Especially for this.\" x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x \"Don! What are we doing down here?\" Cosmo whispered harshly as Don strolled casually along the corridor, \"Don!\" \"Calm down, Cos,\" Don smiled one of his blinding Hollywood smiles and Cosmo rolled his eyes at his friend, mentally making a note to deal with that ego of his one day soon, \"I need a fitting, and you're coming along to... hold my coat.\" \"Why Don, you're a card,\" Cosmo said sarcastically. He wiped the palms of his hands against his pants and looked into the door at the colourful array of costumes on display at the costuming department. As much as he detested another of Don Lockwood's infamous plans of romance, he was still a bit excited at the possibility of finding, \"Dana.\" Dana Mercy spun on her heel in the doorway to the costume department of Monumental pictures. For a second she seemed surprised to see Don Lockwood standing in her path offering her his hand, and then all at once Cosmo could tell she had spotted him. \"Mr. Noth-...\" she looked upset for a second, her hand still clasped with Don's, \"I was wondering if I'd see you again.\" \"Miss Mercy,\" Cosmo stepped forwards awkwardly, hands jumping about across his chest and then clasping themselves behind his back briefly, \"um... hi.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own Singin' in the Rain or any of its recognizable characters or storylines; I "},{"Movie":"Gamera","Title":"Paths Forward","Author":"DaveTheAnalyzer","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12032765","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Note: Toto, Gamera, and other characters are the property of Kadokawa Pictures. Paths Forward by The Analyzer \"I won't ever forget you. So…go. Go, Toto!\" With those final words, Toto found the strength to get on his feet. He turned on the jets near his legs and steam surrounded Toto as he tucked his limbs in and began spinning through the air. He ascended above the towers of the city, making a beeline for the distant shore. Even if Toto was able to peak his head out, he would have lost sight of Toru and the others within the first several seconds of takeoff. A tremor went through his heart at the thought of his young guardian and friend but he kept flying. Toto wouldn't betray Toru's sacrifice and belief in him. Beyond the roar of his jets, Toto became aware of another sound approaching, a screech of fire and metal. A simple peek out showed that it was the humans' aerial machines, small but gray and angular, coming up at a safe distance on either side of him. They didn't do anything but the pieces of metal attached below the wings made Toto cognizant of what they could and might do if they wanted to stop his escape. As he neared the city shoreline, Toto sped ahead and swerved several degrees to the right. He then swerved to the left as he passed over ocean water and to the right again, the aerial machines attempting to keep up. He tried to lose them as he went for deeper waters. He needed to go where he could rest and think, and where humans couldn't reach him. But no matter how Toto swerved, the jets lost distance but kept him within their sight. Toto might be faster but the aerial machines had some good speed of their own. At this point, Toto decided to change tactics. As the buildings disappeared behind him, Toto judged he went far enough across the ocean. With a thrust, Toto went a bit higher in the air before diving into the waters. A searing cold swept over his body. He stopped spinning, and his head and arms reemerged as he used his jets to swim from the surface. Toto didn't look back at the aerial machines. They most likely weren't capable of swimming. Toto's goal was to make himself scarce before the swimming machines were sent out. So he went into the depths in search of a place where he couldn't be found and be able to spend some time in quiet. After what felt like an hour, Toto found a small protrusion on the ocean floor to rest against. He sailed over and quietly landed, exhaustion traveling through his limbs. His battle with Zedus and that quick retreat had taken a lot out of him. Toto closed his eyes, his many injuries flaring up now that the adrenaline was leaving him. Zedus had inflicted a lot of painful stab wounds and gashes with that powerful tongue of his, and that left out the bruises Toto received from being slapped around, thrown into buildings, and falling to the earth. His body was a cacophony of aches and pains. It would take some time until the last of these agonies were silenced. Toto certainly didn't enjoy the experience but found he could tolerate the pain. Toto was from a hardy lot and he hadn't let the pain get him down in battle. He pushed it all into the back of his mind while he focused on the past events that were the several days of his life. His mind turned first to worry over how Toru and the others would be treated by the men in those intimidating vehicles. From the way they drove toward Toto, they really wanted to acquire him. Toto had the feeling they were the same people who took and pumped him with that liquefied pearl that made him stronger and bigger, and that made Toto apprehensive. So he was quite grateful when Toru, his friends, and all those other kids threw themselves into the intimidating men's path. That was a selfless act and Toto felt warmth in his chest at the concept of those children taking that risk for him. It didn't seem like a last stand where they put their lives on the line. Toru, the other children, and even Toru's father didn't appear worried about being run over. So Toto trusted they thought it wasn't a deadly risk. Since those intimidating men were so determined to get Toto, though, he was concerned of what they might do to Toru and the others in retaliation. The intimidating men probably want to make their displeasure known for such interference. If the intimidating men didn't know already, they might grill Toru and the others about Toto, probing their connection to him and his origins. Toto had the sense such interrogations wouldn't be comfortable, especially for children. The children and Toru's father might come away from the experience so unsettled they wouldn't have a restful sleep for many nights. Toto felt a flicker of anger. No one deserved such harassment, especially children who still had much growing up to do. The intimidating men might watch Toru and the others from now on. If Toto came back, those men would capture him, and punish his human friends to boot. Toru and the others deserved to grow up healthy and happy, without the responsibility of contacting Toto on their shoulders. Toto's heart ached. To keep his human friends healthy and happy, Toto had to stay away from them and the village. It was necessary, Toto thought. Even if those intimidating men lost interest and slinked off, meeting with Toru wouldn't exactly be safe. Toto would probably be noticed no matter how quietly he slipped out of the ocean or how carefully he stepped around the trees and buildings. That meant Toto had to keep his distance for a long, long time. That likely meant he must never see Toru again. Toto felt that sad ache spread to the rest of his body, and tried to keep it in check. There was no helping the situation. This was for the best. Besides, Toru would probably have done the same for Toto if their positions were switched. Toru…Toto's thoughts still became warm whenever he thought about the boy. Their bond didn't get to a perfect start but that passion had been strong from the beginning. Toru took care of Toto for a day or two before the boy's father nearly discovered him and Mai spotted him. For reasons lost to Toto, that made Toru's commitment waver. He tried to leave Toto on the beach where the turtle could strike out on his own. But Toto had been upset and confused – this felt far too soon for them to part. There must be a mistake. Toto followed Toru, the only person he knew, who raised and cared for him, to find out why Toru was doing this and beg him to reconsider. Those efforts got him in the path of a truck but after Toru rescued him, the boy had a change of heart. From that day forward, Toru helped Toto in any way he could. Toto had been so relieved the care and affection resumed he didn't even inquire why Toru felt the brief impulse to abandon him. Toru commitment was so great he hid Toto from his father and roped in his friends for assistance. Apparently public knowledge of this arrangement was a threat, since Toru and his friends quietly and quickly moved Toto in the dead of night to a shed where they could visit him. Toto had been a bit upset he couldn't be with Toru as much as he liked but didn't complain. If secrecy was what was required to maintain his bond with Toru, Toto would cooperate. The turtle appreciated Toru's efforts. They were a sign the boy loved him very much and Toto was happier whenever Toru could be present. If Toru could be happy, Toto was happy. So when Toto sensed Zedus's approach and that he himself was about to eclipse the shed in size, Toto fled for the forests. Toru would be upset by his charge's disappearance, but anyone else finding Toto and discovering his relationship with the boy was such a threat to their bond Toto had to act. When Zedus came to shore, and threatened the village and the lives of Toru's father and Katsuya, all concern about secrecy vanished. Toto interceded, fighting even though he was scared and quite outmatched. He didn't know what Toru would make of his turtle-friend being so giant. Not only was Toto too big to take care of, but he displayed himself to the whole world. Toto feared Toru might reject him, abandon him, but the sight of Toru's loved ones being potentially taken away frightened him even more. He needed to do something, and he feared Toru wouldn't understand. But Toru called for Toto during battle. When the intimidating men took Toto away, Toru attempted to pursue, calling his name, looking so worried. Toru still cared about Toto. No matter how big Toto got, no matter how much everyone knew about him, Toru cared enough to come after him and all of Toto's fears melted away. He didn't struggle when the liquid pearl of his predecessor was pumped into him, the liquid that made his duty more manageable. Toto felt it was his duty to do all in his power to protect Toru and his compassions, and if that meant being experimented on, so be it. So when Zedus returned, Toto was ready to fight. As he sustained blow after blow, he saw the many humans, many children, who had more time to flee now Zedus was distracted from his desire to feed and Toto found the drive to continue standing up. His encounters with Mai, Ishimaru, and Katsuya showed Toto there were many children like Toru and they needed to be kept safe from threats like Zedus. As the fight dragged on, with no end in sight, Toto increasingly thought drastic action had to be taken. To save Toru and the world he loved, Toto was willing to endure agony and even death to put down Zedus once and for all. Toru wasn't going to have any of that. He confronted Toto and persuaded him not to sacrifice himself. Toru didn't want to lose another loved one. That startled Toto. Toru wished to keep Toto alive so much the boy risked his life going through an embattled city and up a damaged building to deliver that message and the last jewel. Toru was so young, so inexperienced and yet he did all that because a world without Toto was unbearable. Toto was moved – he couldn't, wouldn't, disappoint the boy like that. So when Zedus rammed Toto out of that building, Toto put all of his concentration in those few seconds of falling on remembering to live and using the last jewel he just ingested to fly like he flew several days earlier. It was because of Toru and his compassion that Toto was able to defeat Zedus in the end. Toru…Toto wished he could see the boy again. If only Toto could be with Toru, find some way to talk with him and make clear how much the giant turtle valued and loved the boy. It would be so wonderful. But if that couldn't happen, being in Toru's presence would be enough to make Toto happy. Toru would probably get the message with a simple exchange of gazes. Reason soon reasserted itself in Toto's mind, though. He must keep Toru safe, and Toto's future would likely be filled with danger, so Toto had to remain away. It would be lonely for both of them but it was necessary At least Toru had his friends Ishimaru, Katsuya, and Mai as well as his father to look after him. Toru wouldn't be alone to cope with whatever the intimidating men shall do. They would help him get back to normal life in the village and repair what was damaged. Toto could rest a bit easier knowing they were there for Toru. In some manners, Toto's fondness for Ishimaru and Katsuya was only a few steps behind his fondness for Toru. Admittedly, when they came over to Toru's home, Toto found their fascination with him a little strange. He didn't know who these boys were and what their relationship to Toru was. They acted friendly enough to Toru and Toto, though, so Toto assumed that even though the pair didn't live in Toru's house, they must be good people. When Toto became too big to live in Toru's house, Ishimaru and Katsuya assisted Toru in Toto's move to the shed. Toto found it significant they got up in the middle of the night and sacrificed time they could have slept for people they weren't related to and his affection for them rose. So when Toto rammed into Zedus, he was so glad he saved Katsuya and Toru's father from being eaten. Toru's father might have been a source of distress for Toru but that the man saved Toru's friend despite the risks raised Toto's affection for him too. He saw Ishimaru and Katsuya side by side with Toru when the boy called out Toto's name in the city. The pair apparently helped Toru get the jewel back from Mai and Toto found that heartening. That meant they were the types of comrades who were willing to stick beside Toru through thick and thin. With those kind of friends around, Toru was likely to be alright. Toru might find the long rebuilding and recovery process difficult, so it would be great if Ishimaru and Katsuya were around to make it a bit easier. Mai would definitely also be of help. Though he stopped seeing the girl just before all that Zedus drama started, he felt connected to her, even when he departed the city. Toto couldn't help but suspect she had faith in him and was desperate to help him in some way. Well, she did help and it had something to do with the last pearl Toru delivered. No matter how limited that help was, the pearl gave him that final kick and Toto valued her efforts in that arena. Though Mai wasn't always supportive of Toto. From her reactions around him, Mai had mixed thoughts about Toto and apparently knew something of his ancestry. That worried Toto. Mai might have persuaded Toru to abandon Toto and be more of a threat to their relationship than Toru's oblivious father. Despite this danger, Toto found he couldn't hold anything against her. She was just concerned about Toru's wellbeing, and as Toto learned in his final battle with Zedus, concern can make you do foolish things. Mai's feelings toward Toto must have warmed, however. She did help in Toto's move to the shed. When Toto swallowed the pearl Toru threw, there was the telltale feeling Mai had been holding onto it. If Mai hadn't been held up with whatever occupied her, Toto was sure Mai would have stood alongside Toru and the other children in defiance of the intimidating men. His fondness for Mai equaled that for Ishimaru and Katsuya. Toto wished they could have spent more time together. Toto relaxed as the blare of pain started to ebb. His body was already doing its work. It would take several days, even weeks, but Toto would be healed. Even before Toto's wounds really vanished, he would be able to move again and find some other place to rest and recuperate. Toto wasn't sure how well hidden he was at his current location, so once he was in a better condition, he had to find a more fortified place. He was sure no one would be able to find him anytime soon but better to be safe than sorry. These concerns compelled Toto to reluctantly disconnect his thoughts from Toru and the others, and focus on his present and future. There was so much to do and consider. As a guardian, he had a lot of responsibility and he needed to explore what those responsibilities entailed. One responsibility was not getting caught. In some way, the intimidating men and the organization behind them did help him. They pumped Toto with enough of that liquefied pearl for him to stand a chance against Zedus. In retrospect, Toto and the intimidating men's interests overlapped. They wanted to get rid of Zedus as much as Toto, and worked with him to help make that goal a reality. Toto was grateful for assistance in that area. Toto wasn't so grateful for their attempt to recapture him. They likely wanted to use him for other possible monster threats and didn't want him to wander without their supervision. They might come to track Toto in other ways but they wouldn't be able to control his movements and they would just have to deal with it. Toto preferred to move under his own will and make his own decisions. After all, the judgements of the intimidating men mightn't be sound. They didn't foresee the need to protect the building they held him in from monster attacks and, as a result, probably many of number didn't survive. So Toto shall act on his own, using his experience and mind to keep citizens safe. Granted, his experience amounted to a week, and he found it challenging to put together a plan while fighting Zedus and keeping a safe distance from civilians. But he tried, and Toto's instincts told him the intimidating men mightn't always have the safety of civilians in mind when dealing with threats. If the intimidating men and their organization wanted to coordinate with Toto against an enemy, Toto wouldn't mind as long as their help was sound. Who knew how tough the next enemy would be? Toto might need allies to assist him in ways that would lead to the defeat of these future foes. However, if the intimidating men wanted to manipulate him for goals other than defeating monsters, Toto wouldn't be as cooperative. If it involved hurting civilians, doing damage to the environment, or fighting monsters that were otherwise no threat to humanity or Earth, Toto might even go against them. Unless there was a specific danger to people and the environment, the intimidating men should expect only indifference or defiance from Toto. Future monster threats…he had a lifetime ahead of dealing with menaces equal to or greater than his size. Toto still had a lot of growing up to do, but the \"greater than\" part could still qualify long after he reached his ultimate height. There were giants of all sorts in the world that Toto could barely comprehend, from those that resembled larger versions of plants and animals to completely alien beings he wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of. A part of him feared these unknowns. How could he defeat an enemy he couldn't wrap his mind around? But the rest of him remembered he had trouble thinking of how to defeat Zedus and he did find a path to victory. He was determined to find that path again and again, no matter the hardships. After all, it was his duty. Though in his first battle, Toto had Toru and the others to help him down that path… At once, Toto shook his head. Those humans popped up in his thought processes again. He had to move on, he needed to keep his focus from straying. Toto had to find his path to victory on his own. It was Toto's determination that allowed him to last long enough for Toru and his friends to help out. But it was also cunning. To compensate for any help that mightn't be forthcoming, Toto had to acquire more cunning to locate his enemies' weaknesses. Toto fought Zedus with great determination but Toto's cunning only extended to beating Zedus by wearing him down. It had been hard enough to keep his brain power while being worn down himself, never mind figuring out a way to pinpoint and attack Zedus's weaknesses. In the meantime, Toto couldn't prevent Zedus from doing damage in the middle of the city. Toto was immobilized until the building that housed him collapsed around his ears. The only excuse Toto would have next time was time, distance, and awareness of the threat. Toto knew he could sense when a new threat was active, so that was one problem out of the way. He wouldn't be serenely cruising through the ocean while somewhere a monster was razing a city to the ground. Toto's other concern would be finding a location where he could duel a threat, and buildings and humans wouldn't be harmed. Depending on the enemy's goal, they might be more interested in remaining in a city and among humans than attempting to take down Toto. If Toto tried to retreat, the enemy could just shrug and proceed on to their destructive and murderous goals. If Toto couldn't lure the enemy away with the desire to take down an infuriating foe, then he had to gain the strength to drag them off or keep them in one spot while the humans evacuated. With that strength, Toto could defeat the enemy without having to worry as much about building damage or civilian casualties. It would be difficult, since Zedus and other monsters like him were particularly stubborn in following their goals. As Toto learned today, however, he could be just as stubborn and become even more so as he grew with experience. Besides, maybe there was a possibility not all monsters need to be fought or eliminated. Surely, there were giants like Toto who weren't interested in causing destruction or could be persuaded in pursuing another path. It was a possibility worth considering. There would be monsters who wouldn't be shaken from their desires and needed to be put down. But just as there were humans who were malleable and capable of reform, there must be monsters who could have a change of heart. If Toto could make these monsters have second thoughts, then not only would conflicts end in a much more peaceful manner (A resolution Toto would prefer in most altercations), but he could maybe gain an ally in the fight to preserve the world. Toto could and would work alone in such a duty if he must, but if there were monsters who were willing to lend a hand, ones he helped in the past, he wasn't going to turn the possibility down. Not only could it make fights easier, he would at least have some companionship from those he didn't have to fear cursing or endangering by simply being near them. At least the monsters might be so equal in size and power that neither could really endanger the other. If Toto could, he would sigh. This was all too entirely hypothetical. He was so young and there were so many experiences he could only imagine, not remember. He would only know if these questions had answers when he went through the experience of answering them. For all he knew, Toto might be the only monster around who had any warm feelings toward humanity, and was willing to put himself on the line for them. The most he could hope for was to dissuade some monsters from their destructive ways, and they would retreat back to their strongholds and likely not be heard from again. It would be up to Toto and maybe some cooperative humans to pick up the slack of defending Earth. He had to prepare for all sorts of possibilities. Really, that line of thought about monsters becoming friends was probably a way to assuage himself about Toru and the others. Toto cringed. It was much harder than he thought to keep his mind away from his dear humans. The possibility of never seeing them again made him feel a low, unbearable ache. It was something he was ready to do to keep them safe from the malice of other monsters or organizations but that didn't mean the pain of such a separation went away. Toto wouldn't be surprised if Toru and the others felt a similar pain in the next couple of days. Toru wanted Toto to be free, not be bound to him. He and his friends risked themselves for that to happen. But that didn't mean Toru and the others wouldn't feel sad over the separation. They would struggle with the pain but try to move on. But Toru and the others wouldn't remain children forever. Within ten years, they would be adults, able to make their own decisions about what they wanted to do. They might have moved on from Toto, and pursued passions that had little to do with the weird and dangerous world of monsters. But even if their passions wouldn't be related to monsters, whenever news came in of a monster, or Toto in the heat of battle, they would think about him. They would probably smile proudly and hope Toto succeeded in taking down the latest menace. They would still miss him. With the paths adulthood opened up, Toru and the others could even contemplate how to see Toto again. Would Toto be okay with that, though? Would Toto allow such a reunion to happen or would he have limited say in the matter? It wasn't like Toto could conduct distant communication with his human friends to give the warning. The only way Toto could make his intentions clear would be when they made direct contact. Toto didn't know if he had the heart to persuade his human friends to turn away and not return, or worse coldly not engage until they got the message. Depending on the timing, whether such an engagement took place during a fight or in the lulls between crises, the encounter could present an even worse danger for Toru and the others. A clever monster or organization could observe this relationship and exploit it by kidnapping or harming Toto's human friends. Toto could be discouraged from helping others or even be used as a weapon. Toto couldn't stand having that on his conscience and wondered what he could do in such a scenario. Though if Toru and the others knew the risks and took the necessary precautions while still wanting to meet Toto, he had trouble imagining himself turning his nose up in disapproval. They might be days, hours, or even scant minutes but such meetings would be precious to Toto and his human friends. Their bond was the type neither wanted to break or maintain through sheer memory if they had to. Just because neither wanted to be bound to the other didn't mean they had to stop keeping in touch. And if there was a way both parties could meet without being endangered, Toru and the others were going to pursue it and Toto would feel little inclination to stop them. Not only would it be great for their friendship, they might also inform him of how human society worked, who to trust or not trust, and how to cooperate with plans against enemy monsters. It wouldn't only benefit Toto and his human friends but the rest of humanity. Even if there were no world changing benefits, though, Toto would still be inclined toward meetings with Toru and the others. After their first few encounters, they could arrange a way to figure out meeting times without monsters or organizations being any the wiser. Then they could hang out, speak with each other, and even play. Toto didn't play much with Toru and the others but when they did, it had been wonderful. Toto wouldn't mind more play in these potential meetings, even if his great size limited the possible games. That was a dream with so many obstacles ahead but it was a dream worth fighting for. Toto thought of the possibility of a world where the human organizations wouldn't harass him or those he loved, where monster threats could be dealt with in the cleanest and most efficient manner possible, with minimum civilian casualties and maybe even the recruitment of monsters to good. If Toto proved himself reliable and made clear he wouldn't work with an organization's less than kind intentions, then he might be able to meet up freely with Toru and the others once in a while, able to give joy to his friends as well as receive it from those who might be his only companions for his entire life. If there was anything Toto's brief week of existence showed him, it was that paths opened up if one struggled and thought hard enough. Toto remained where he lay at the bottom of the ocean, the sting of wounds signaling the beginning of a long mending process. That left Toto with little more to do than muse about the possibilities to come. Few of these possibilities were concrete. For all Toto knew, none could be made into reality. The only certainty Toto faced was that another monster battle awaited him and it would be prudent to prepare. Toto would prepare, as it was his duty to protect humanity. But if there was a way to reunite with his human friends and befriend monsters, then Toto would prepare for that possibility as well, no matter how difficult reaching it might be or if it added any more scars that signified his status as protector. After all, Toru and the others would do the same for him. The End ","Summary":" Note: Toto, Gamera, and other characters are the property of Kadokawa Pictures.

When he took the job of investigating why a ship full of plutonium mysteriously ran aground in the middle of the ocean, he thought he would be part of little more than another story about a near-nuclear catastrophe thankfully averted by sheer luck. He didn't expect to later learn he parked a boat right next to a dormant sea monster that his people barely escaped when it awakened, nor of its ancient origins as the last hope, Gamera. Seeing that monstrous giant throw a hand to shield Yoshinari, Nagamine, and the rescued child from Gyaos's cutting beam added further complications to the mix, though he was thankful the man who drove him to the Kiso Mountain Range was the same one who was currently driving him back to help prepare the report for tomorrow's government meeting. Right now Yoshinari was staring the middle distance, maneuvering their car on automatic pilot. Naoya would have worried about a potential car accident with how distracted Yoshinari was but fortunately there were few vehicles on the road and he seemed to know what he was doing. Nagamine wasn't with them. Naoya overheard Yoshinari offer Nagamine a drive back but she politely declined. Her vehicle and driver were still in one piece. To break the silence as evening past, Naoya turned on the radio. \"…the engagement with Gamera abruptly ended after he flew off to the sky upon being injured by the Gyaos.\" The newsreader was saying. \"The air force had attempted to give pursuit but Gamera disappeared into the sea and his current whereabouts are unknown. The navy has been called to patrol that area but for the moment, there are no reported signs of where in those depths Gamera might be. A spokesman for the JSDF has said-\" Naoya didn't object when Yoshinari turned off the radio, exhaling hard as he shook his head. \"Gamera isn't the enemy. He is a protector. He might damage city property but he isn't a great danger to humanity like the Gyaos are.\" \"I know.\" Naoya replied. \"But the property damage is impressive and unfortunately causes much more outrage than the humans the Gyaos have eaten. After that close brush, I believe Nagamine is on our side. Let's call her later and discuss what it would take to convince the government the Gyaos are the greater danger.\" Yoshinari nodded determinedly, staring at the road ahead with new fire. Naoya wasn't as hopeful their determination would be able to persuade the government but he wasn't going to let another attack against Gamera transpire without a fight. Everyone needed to get their priorities straight in this current crises, with so many lives riding on the line. A ring interrupted Naoya's mental pep talk. Hands scrambling in pockets, he pulled out his cell phone and flipped it open. \"Hello?\" \"Is this the father of Kusanagi Asagi speaking?\" An unfamiliar woman's voice said. \"Yes?\" Naoya said, puzzled. \"Who is this?\" \"This is a call from Gotenbakogen Hospital in Gotenba, Shizuoka Prefecture. Your daughter was recently admitted here with a cut on her left arm. Our doctors had tended to her injury and early signs say she'll recover. We attempted to call you after finding her ID but your answering machine told us to go for your cell phone number, so we called there.\" \"Asagi is in the hospital.\" Naoya never heard the mention of his daughter spoken in that cheery, clinical business tone he often heard on hospital calls. He sat up straighter. \"What happened? How did she get the cut?\" \"She and a taxi driver had just come from the Mt. Fuji area where the military was engaging with Gamera.\" \"They were at Mt.-\" Naoya straightened himself so fast he was surprised his head didn't bang against the vehicle ceiling. Incomprehension and worry fought for dominance. \"I thought the military would close the area to civilians!\" \"The taxi driver rammed through the checkpoint.\" The woman said in that clinical business tone. \"He told me when he brought her in.\" \"He what?\" Naoya rubbed his temples as the throbbing reached a new intensity. His face became grim. \"Is he still around? When I get my hands on him for bringing my daughter into a war zone, I'll tighten my grip around his neck and-\" \"Actually, your daughter woke up while we treated her.\" The woman calmly interrupted him. \"She insisted to tell you that it was her fault. She said she pressured the taxi driver to go, wanting to see Gamera up close.\" Naoya sighed. That was just like Asagi, wanting to cover for others, especially for the mistakes she made. Out of the corner of Naoya's eye, he saw Yoshinari stealing concerned glances toward him. Naoya gave a reassuring flap of one hand and then stared ahead. \"So the only injury Asagi got was a cut?\" Naoya asked slowly. \"No other injuries? That taxi driver should be thankful that was the only injury she got for getting in the middle of the line of fire.\" \"That's the strange thing, Kusanagi-san.\" That clinical business tone wavered. \"We'll likely show you the full report when you get here but the cut Asagi got doesn't seem to match any usual wounds found in a warzone. It seems more like she got in an unfortunate encounter with a knife but…it's too clean. As I said, we don't believe any muscle or tissue were irrevocably damaged but this doesn't seem like the usual injury for the dangerous event she was in the vicinity of. Then again, our knowledge of war injuries is more research based. To repeat, we'll give you the full report when you arrive and you can be assured your daughter will be taken care of to the best of our ability.\" \"I see.\" Naoya adopted his own calm, business tone. \"Thank you for informing me and the treatment you're giving my daughter. Call me if anything happens. Bye.\" Naoya closed the phone and replaced it in his pocket, giving another sigh. He trusted the reassurance of the woman but he couldn't help but worry about Asagi's condition, in addition to the puzzling information she gave him. Yoshinari glanced at Naoya in concern. \"Is Asagi alright?\" Yoshinari asked, slightly bewildered. \"What was that about her being in a war zone?\" \"It sounds like she is fine, thank goodness, but she bribed a taxi driver to go where the military was engaging Gamera.\" At Yoshinari's shocked look, Naoya nodded agreeably. \"Oh, I know. Those are words I never expected to hear concerning someone like her. Honestly, that driver should have refused her request since he's supposed to be a responsible adult and she's fourteen. I need to pick her up at Gotenbakogen Hospital. Would it be too much trouble if we…\" \"That will be no problem at all. That's in Gotenba, Shizuoka Prefecture, correct?\" At Naoya's nod, Yoshinari shook his head but, to Naoya's slight relief, kept his eyes calmly on the road and his driving steady. \"I'm glad to hear she's okay.\" \"Yeah, it's a miracle her injury didn't seem to have anything to do with the crossfire.\" Naoya frowned. \"I wonder what made her act like that…and I want to know how she got cut if nothing hit where she and that driver were standing…\" \"It was probably some minor debris.\" Yoshinari said reasonably. \"Even the smallest particles of dirt could leave behind damage in a military setting. Asagi and that driver conceivably didn't notice it among the other rocks and dirt on the road. I believe I've read about some of those injuries during free time on the long voyages.\" Naoya nodded slowly. \"Yeah, I believe I've read up on that as well. You're likely right. It perhaps isn't anything too weird.\" \"The only weird thing is her bribing a Taxi driver to go into a war zone for Gamera.\" Yoshinari said. \"But I'm sure we'll get some sort of explanation on that once we reach the hospital.\" Naoya twitched his head in acknowledgement once more before silence fell between the men. Yes, there was nothing too suspicious going on. The most Naoya suspected was that Asagi went to Mt. Fuji so she could find some way to stop the military from attacking Gamera. She was there when he and Yoshinari figured out some of the origins of Gamera and the Gyaos, and was understandably on their side on which monster was good and which was a greater threat to humanity. She was just the kind type who would help somebody like that. Naoya relaxed himself with that thought as the drive wore on, trying not to think about the bead Yoshinari gifted her, the bead that seemed to glow with the mention of a single name. Naoya sat in his New York City apartment several months later with that memory passing through. In retrospect, he felt silly for dismissing the nagging clues that fit so neatly like a puzzle. His daughter was connected to Gamera. During moments when that connection grew close, Asagi shared his injuries as well as energy. Though thankfully her connection never grew that strong again after the defeat of the Gyaos, there were still moments where she would sleep a bit longer than usual and occasionally mention a dream about swimming in the depths of the Pacific that sometimes reminded Naoya life never really returned to normal ever since monsters were revealed to be a reality. This change in reality was compounded as he watched a late night news report about the emergence of alien creatures in Sapporo and their attack on Gamera. His phone was on his ear, half listening to the details about the christening of the creatures as Symbiotic Legion and how the body of the big one who fell into the sea wasn't found. That certainly didn't spell good news to this crises being over anytime soon and was a further reason why he was accepting an international call from someone he was now worried about dearly. After a long pause, there was a click of the connection. \"Hey, Dad.\" Asagi said. \"How are you?\" \"I've been enjoying my evening off…well, as much as one could while watching the news.\" Naoya answered lightly. \"What about you?\" \"We're okay. My friend and I are at Sendai Station right now waiting for our train to depart.\" \"Ah, I see.\" Naoya said neutrally. \"So your trip hasn't been cancelled.\" \"No, we're still going.\" Naoya felt an ominous fog slip into his stomach. \"Are you sure? Especially after what happened in Sapporo–\" \"It'll be fine, Dad.\" Asagi replied. \"You worry too much, that's your trouble. We're not going to Hokkaido. I told you, we're going to ski in Zao.\" Naoya exhaled and rubbed the area between his eyebrows. His daughter did speak sense. Japan was a big country and there were parts that hadn't been even touched by the Gamera and Gyaos battles. It wasn't likely Asagi would run across the danger of monsters yet another time. \"Okay.\" Naoya said, resigned. \"But be careful. Keep an ear out for any news.\" \"Yeah, I understand.\" Asagi replied. \"You take care in New York. Now, that place is dangerous!\" That tugged a smile out of Naoya. \"Then I'll be careful if you're careful. Have fun skiing in Zao. I look forward to talking whenever you have the time.\" Asagi gave a small laugh. \"Right, it's a promise. I'll call back with all sorts of fun tales of our Zao trip.\" Naoya and Asagi said their farewells, and the line was disconnected. He replaced the telephone on its receiver, a bit more at ease. Asagi was an independent sort who was able to take care of herself, especially since Naoya moved to America. She would be alert for any news regarding the Legion and especially Gamera. It was likely Asagi and her friend would return from their skiing trip with nothing more exciting to report than any good ski feats accomplished and near accidents that would be the source of much laughter for the next week or two. Just life like any other person. With that peace of mind, Naoya shut off the television and went to bed. Naoya watched the video of Sendai going up in a fireball be replayed on the news for what felt like the umpteenth time, mind most definitely not at peace. The video paused and was replaced by the feed of a western reporter standing several miles away from the former city. \"Casualty reports are still initial but the numbers are low to what they could have been with Sendai's population. Thanks to the plan of Japan's government and its Self Defense Force, many citizens were carefully but swiftly evacuated before the big explosion came. Gamera did battle with the queen Legion near one of the evacuation points but fortunately no JSDF helicopters have been reported to have been downed by the fighting. Gamera was then last reported going in the direction of the pod to presumably destroy it like the one in Sapporo but reports of his departure before or after the blast haven't come in. Meanwhile-\" As the reporter proceeded to detail what President Clinton offered in humanitarian and military assistance, Naoya turned his head side to side in disbelief. He expected he would hear reports of further Japanese cities being damaged with those Legion on the loose but Sendai being wiped off of the map? These Legion seemed, if possible, even more dangerous than the Gyaos. But his contemplations turned to Asagi and whether she and her friends were still in Zao or had returned to Sendai for the train back to Tokyo. Wasn't the day for that return in the past day or two? Surely they could have heard about what was going on from Zao and had stayed put until everything died down, right? Even as Naoya attempted to comfort himself with that thought, he glanced at the nearby phone, willing to get at least some sort of call. No sooner did he take his eyes away from the phone that a sudden ring made him jump. He swept a hand out to get the phone and nearly dropped it in his haste. \"Is that you, Asagi?\" Naoya said, breathless. \"Yeah, Dad. Don't worry, I'm safe.\" Naoya felt said worry drain out of him at the sound of his daughter's voice. He slumped in his couch in relief. \"Thank goodness. After last talking to you in Sendai, I couldn't help but fear…where are you and your friend now? In Zao?\" \"Back in Tokyo.\" Asagi replied. \"Actually, we returned from the skiing trip after my friend broke her leg when she lost control down one slope. We were in Sendai on the day it got destroyed.\" \"You were there?\" Well, there went the calm of his daughter not being in danger. Naoya sat up. \"I assume you're still alive to talk to me because you two managed to get out in time, correct?\" \"Barely.\" Asagi paused. \"Uh, our helicopter was last to leave when the Legion queen showed up. The ground shaking delayed us from lifting off. If Gamera hadn't shown up to protect our helicopter from being crushed, I wouldn't be speaking to you.\" \"You were nearly crushed by the Legion queen?\" Naoya tried to keep his voice calm. At his worst yet hopeful imaginary scenario, he thought Asagi and her friend got out only an hour before the explosion. That the pair were nearly killed in a battle between monsters as well only made Naoya more anxious. \"I'm thankful that you all survived that mostly unharmed. You are unharmed, are you?\" \"Other than a few bumps and bruises from the helicopter being rocked about, I think we all made it out okay. My friend went back to her parents since they were very worried about her and last I heard, she was sent to the hospital to get their own take on the injuries.\" They sounded like good parents. Naoya resisted the urge to suggest Asagi do the same. \"I see. So you're back at your apartment and resting after such an ordeal. Do you want me to fly to get to you? Or would you be okay with flying to America on your own? I'm willing to be there if you need me or want to go somewhere safe.\" \"I'm fine, Dad. Hearing your voice is good enough for me.\" There was a smile in Asagi's voice. \"In fact, I'm in contact with a woman who's like Nagamine-san but with the Legion – Honami Midori-san. We met on the helicopter and she's watching out for me while she helps the government figure out how to defeat the Legion.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" Naoya was soon distracted from his elation though. \"Still, for you to be caught in the middle of a monster battle twice in a row – or does us flying after the final battle between Gamera and Gyaos count as a third incident? – it's pretty strange.\" Asagi gave a small laugh. \"And this time, I didn't bribe someone to get me in the middle of it. It was all a complete accident.\" Naoya couldn't resist smiling slightly. \"I'd say. I hope there isn't another time where it happens, though with how Gamera currently is…\" Silence fell between them. On the screen, a camera from a military helicopter flying over Sendai broadcast the devastation. Barely even parts of buildings were standing. The helicopter traveled several more miles and only one thing seemed to match the old heights of Sendai's tallest buildings – the tall husk of a giant with a round shell, head bowed as though in defeat. Gamera's husk leaned in on itself, still, like the fossils of old. Naoya could only look at the screen in shock. Asagi's quiet held a similar emotion. Was she watching the same thing on her television at home or did she just sense what was going on like she had ever since she first bonded with Gamera? Was the sea monster's current state affecting her? Naoya twitched and coughed. \"Are you sure you're okay? You sound fine but I can't help but worry.\" \"I'm alright.\" Asagi answered. \"Gamera turned down his connection to me after he defeated the Gyaos, remember? He perhaps saw there were more battles ahead and if anything were to happen to him – that's one reason why I want to remain here in Japan. I can't just abandon Gamera in this current crises.\" \"Abandon Gamera?\" Naoya repeated in bewilderment. \"But Asagi, he's –\" \"I believe Gamera's still alive,\" she said firmly. \"Maybe not in the sense of what we know but he won't allow Legion to continue to ravage the Earth like this. He'll find some way to come back.\" Naoya found himself a bit less lost as he blinked once, twice, three times. \"The reveal there are monsters have shattered a lot of my beliefs over the past year – but him rising back after such an explosion…\" \"I'm not sure if it's because of what little connection I have to Gamera or intuition I picked up from that connection but I can't think Gamera would be gone just like that. Whether it's for a few hours or a few days, Gamera will rest, rejuvenate and come back to protect this world. I'm sure of it. That's why I'm planning to take a plane with Honami-san back to Sendai. I want to be there when it happens.\" Naoya felt the worry in his chest swell to twice its size. The explosion had passed and Sendai was only in ruins but…Sendai was in ruins! There were likely all sorts of pitfalls, delicate building remains that could crack under any weight, and other obstacles that could injure or kill someone not careful enough. And that wasn't even mentioning what would happen if Gamera awakened and the debris that would be shifted even if he was aware of Asagi and the others, and was careful with takeoff. \"That would be dangerous, Asagi.\" Naoya said delicately. \"There'll be unstable rubble and debris everywhere, which could be accidentally moved if Gamera awakens. Are you sure you and this Honami-san want to take the risks to go there?\" \"We're sure.\" Asagi replied firmly. \"We won't be the only ones going. Others will come as well. Some will be bringing their kids along and so the organizers are working extra hard to make sure to find the safest place to watch and wait for Gamera. It'll be at a manageable distance. Don't worry Dad, it's not like we're going to hang out right in his literal shadow. Gamera will take care if he senses our presence anyway.\" In Naoya's opinion, it wasn't wise to take children near a monster even if that monster was friendly and comatose but he didn't go down that route. \"Nevertheless, even if Gamera knows you're there, him flying off for the Legion could cause some wreckage to fly around and that could hit you. I don't want you to get hurt, especially after what happened when your connection with Gamera was stronger.\" \"Dad, it'll be okay. Life has always carried around some risk and such risk will be present even with all the precautions taken here but I just have the feeling nothing bad will happen with this vigil. Trust me. I trust Gamera.\" Naoya was quiet and then sighed as he thought over what to say next. Asagi always had a good intuition and Naoya at times didn't know how to handle it. One moment, Asagi could go to the market and be able to track down the cheapest produce, and generally be able to live fine on her own even when Naoya had a particularly engrossing assignment. The next, Asagi was taking a different route home from school, seeming to have gotten lost until those worried about her find her helping a classmate she noticed was ill to his house. This only magnified when Gamera came around and Naoya moved to America. Though that intuition often eased Naoya's worries since she had been able to live away from him for week or even months at a time with little risk of her making the ill-advised decisions her teenage compatriots frequently make, he couldn't help but fear her intuition might lead to a horrible fate for her. *She has gotten hurt before with these decisions.* Naoya ruminated. *And it's not like she has always made the correct decision. She assured she and her friend were unlikely to be endangered by the Legion, and look at what happened.* Nevertheless, the tone in Asagi's voice was such Naoya couldn't help but wane from pressuring her to stay in Tokyo. Asagi probably knew the risks that would come with going back to Sendai and would take the precautions necessary for herself and anyone that would be with her. If there was someone who would have the most common sense on such an expedition, Asagi would be at the top of the list. She would probably make sure everyone did nothing more than prey at Gamera's husk from a safe distance. She would be fine. And Naoya couldn't help but find himself trusting Gamera as well. Putting aside his issues with bonding with her daughter, which led to them sharing injuries, Gamera did his best to make sure humans didn't come under harm. Naoya had seen it himself with Yoshinari and Nagamine, and Gamera did heal Asagi's wounds in the end before their bond weakened. If Gamera did awaken, he would attempt to be careful around the human observers a safe distance away. Naoya blew out a breath as he rubbed the area above his nose and wondered what other parent had to deal with such a weighty decision. \"Very well, it's not like I could stop you from halfway across the planet.\" Naoya said wryly. \"Bring this Honami-san my regards.\" \"Thank you.\" Asagi said softly. \"I at least appreciate your trust in me. We'll be safe. I'll call you some time after we get there.\" \"Okay.\" Naoya struggled to find some parting comment. \"I hope everything will go well in Japan.\" \"Me too, Dad.\" Naoya concluded the call and sat rubbing his temples some more, inexplicably annoyed at scientists for not having developed teleportation yet. He got to his feet to prepare for bed. No use staying up and worrying about his daughter when he could get at least some sleep and think more rationally in the morning. Naoya doubted his rest would be an untroubled one but an uneasy sleep was preferred to staying up all night and operating at work the next day on fumes. The news of Legion's defeat by Gamera was celebrated widely. On television, images were shown of civilians, some decked with Gamera paraphernalia, celebrating in public squares in Tokyo, New York, and other major cities around the world. Naoya himself had ducked through similar crowds on his way from work, not paying them anymore mind than to maneuver around their happy gesticulating. By this point, he was used to the unique way New Yorkers celebrated and knew how to deal with it. Elation of his own filled him at the report of Japan having one more monstrous threat put down but a greater concern was the current condition of Asagi. As evening came with darkness, the phone by the couch finally rang and Naoya grabbed it on the third ring. \"Asagi?\" Naoya said. \"I'm okay, Dad.\" Asagi said. \"I'm in Sendai and we're all okay. The world is okay.\" \"The world we live in would need a lot more help to be okay but never mind that.\" Naoya smiled. \"How are you doing? Now Gamera's back and the Legion are defeated, everyone where you are must be preparing to go home.\" \"Only a few are really starting to prepare for that.\" Asagi replied. \"We're still recovering from seeing Gamera's revival. I'm sure once people get some rest, more flights will be booked when the planes start going up again.\" \"And what about you?\" Naoya asked. \"You'll be back in Tokyo, right?\" \"For a bit. I'm thinking of giving you a visit in New York during spring break, to spend some time with you before the school term resumes here.\" \"Really.\" Naoya kept his voice calm, even as the thought of seeing his daughter sent a fatherly thrill through his chest. \"You don't have to go just because I miss you. You can stay in Japan, and rest there.\" \"I also miss you. And I could rest just fine at your New York apartment. You said you have a guest room in case I decided to visit, after all. I say it wouldn't be much of a burden for either of us at all.\" Naoya immediately dropped any polite protest after that. He wasn't going to protest to something they both wanted, after all. \"Thanks. I look forward to seeing you. So what was watching Gamera's revival like? I surmise it was amazing for you.\" \"It was.\" There was a smile in Asagi's voice. \"We were watching and preying, with only a drum filled with fire to provide light – though there were lights in the nearby tents – for what seemed like forever. Then a few licks from the fire came out and lights hovered around Gamera before…before the husk fell away and he roared into the sky. The children were all happy and we all were happier when we got word Gamera defeated Legion.\" \"I hope someone was taking a video of that. It would be a sight to see.\" But Naoya frowned. Asagi's tone seemed to shift strangely more than halfway through the telling. \"I'm glad to hear that medical team didn't have to be put to much use. It sounds like even Gamera was careful not to hurt any of you.\" Asagi laughed nervously. \"Yeah, about that…\" Naoya straightened quickly. \"Asagi, did something happen?\" Asagi took a deep breath. \"Okay Dad, don't be mad…\" \"So something did happen.\" As Naoya suspected! \"When Gamera was surrounded by those lights, I was gripping my bead really hard and he must have been drawing some kind of energy from his surroundings, for just before he revived, the bead…exploded in my hand.\" Naoya rubbed half of his face with a parental mix of anxiety and anger. \"Gamera's revival hurt you…if I could somehow grow giant and slap that sea monster for hurting my daughter, then I would gladly…or shrink him and slap him to bring him down to size for what he did. Granted, he was probably not aware of this, but still, I would like to have an opportunity to yell at him for doing-\" \"It wasn't much of an injury.\" Asagi said quickly. \"It has long been treated and bandaged up. The doctors say it'll heal within a few weeks. You don't need to go on a crusade against Gamera, though he'd likely understand and be apologetic for the wound.\" The mental image of Gamera bowing in apology to him for injuring his daughter was a bit amusing, and that took a bite out of his anger toward the sea monster. Naoya relaxed at her words reluctantly. If this was a simple flesh wound from an accident, maybe he shouldn't get all worked up about it, especially if Asagi wasn't worked up about it. \"If you say so.\" Naoya said more calmly. \"Though be sure to check the wound again once you get back to Tokyo, just in case. I wouldn't want to chance an infection.\" \"The doctors here seem reliable,\" Asagi paused and he could imagine her shrugging, \"but I'll check for you. I feel a bit sad I lost the bead though.\" \"Sorry.\" Naoya only now realized the implications of that loss. \"Even if your connection to Gamera wasn't what it used to be, I understand why you would be sad that it now seems cutoff. And that bead was a gift from Yoshinari too.\" \"Yeah, the connection was weakening. But with this, there seems to be a finality to it. Don't worry Dad, I've had my cry over it and recovered. I don't know if I'll be able to talk to Gamera like that again but I'm happy Gamera continues to live and will defend the Earth from any future threats.\" \"Me too, Asagi.\" Naoya said. \"Me too. I'm rather pleased not to be food for Gyaos or get suffocated by the Legion and their giant flowers. Anyway, get some rest. You sound like you've been up all night. And give Honami-san my regards for looking after you.\" \"I will.\" There was a yawn. \"And you were right about the needing sleep part. Going to get some now. Bye, Dad.\" Naoya bid farewell to his daughter and looked forward to a much more settled night. Minor annoyance with the injured hand aside, Naoya was in sincere agreement with Asagi. With the titanic threats that come to civilization's shores, Gamera being in the world made it a much safer place. Though Gamera had been reported to accidentally take lives before, he was usually careful and Naoya had confidence Gamera would remain careful in the future. Moving from America's largest city to its capital had meant a lot of hassle and learning new patterns of behavior (More favorably being able to call his daughter without running up international telephone bills), but one thing that didn't change was him sitting on the couch staring at his television in shock, as he came to learn in 1999. The flames engulfing Shibuya ward were surreal to see, especially since many damaged buildings were not only recognizable to many Japanese citizens but were places he used to visit or even travel past himself. He had shopped for Asagi in the 109 Department Store that was now no more. And what was worse, that was one of the few buildings that was damaged by the Gyaos. Much of the destruction was done by a guardian who was shown on the news to be flying straight into the sky. \"This was a video recorded by an office worker from the Setagaya District showing Gamera leaving after his destructive dispatch of the Gyaos. Right now, in the predawn hours, the exact details of the devastation are too early to tell but it's clear a majority of buildings have been damaged and it would be a miracle if the loss of life was somehow not very high. President Clinton has phoned Prime Minister Nagahama to offer his sympathies and pledged American assistance in the rescue and recovery effort…\" There was a ring from the phone. Naoya had made sure it was a cell that could be carried everywhere whether for business or family matters. With recent events, Naoya had a good feeling of what category this call fell under. \"I guess you heard the news about what happened in Shibuya.\" Naoya said casually. \"How couldn't I?\" Asagi asked. \"It's over every channel and radio station.\" A pause, uncomfortable for both sides. Then Naoya carefully asked. \"How are you doing?\" \"I'm doing well, all things considered.\" Asagi said. \"I've contacted the people who are studying Gamera and have studied me in concern with my connection, and see if we're going to talk about it.\" \"Okay.\" If Asagi was going slow with this, then so would Naoya. \"I guess it would be too early to speculate about Gamera's motivations there. I don't want to cause you any distress-\" \"I don't excuse what Gamera has done. He can't avoid causing damage at his size but his disregard for other humans in this instance was inexcusable. But as for an explanation for Gamera's disregard…I believe the increasing number of Gyaos showing up must be making him angry and desperate to protect the Earth. It makes him careless, or at least shift to other priorities so the Gyaos could be gotten rid of first.\" \"I see.\" Naoya replied. \"Trying to prevent another Gyaos influx is understandable but Gamera's carelessness would only make his duty harder. The Japanese government's now all but guaranteed to launch an all-out assault against Gamera if he so much as pokes his head out of the water after the lives he took, no matter how threatening the Gyaos are. This could be bad for all those involved.\" Asagi made a noise of agreement. \"That's why I'm thinking…after I have my talk with the researchers and professors, I might take a trip to Japan. I don't feel good just staying here in America while these worrying things are happening back home. I want to be able to help in some way.\" Oh, lovely. Naoya could clearly remember his confidence that nothing would happen to Asagi during her skiing trip and then a few days later, she barely escaped from a city that was wiped off the map. Naoya rubbed the sweat from his brow. \"Are you sure you would want to go? You probably would only be consulted for insight in so far as how to shoot Gamera out of the sky and even that's my most optimistic reading of the scenario. Not to mention with that incident and most likely more coming to Japan, you would be endangered as well.\" \"Still, I want to do at least something.\" Asagi said, sounding frustrated. \"The world seems to be at a certain tipping point. I know you're worried about me, Dad, but I'll be fine. I'm thinking of getting back into contact with Nagamine-san while there. Maybe I can help with the Gyaos problem. At least you'll be reassured that someone responsible will be looking after me.\" That last part was said in a wry voice. Naoya rubbed his face and shook away the smile threatening to break through. With the current Gyaos outbreak, Nagamine would most likely be too busy to be around Asagi in person. Nevertheless, Naoya trusted Nagamine would try to maintain reliable, albeit irregular, phone contact with Asagi. Nagamine had risked her personal safety for those she barely knew. For the daughter of a former treasured work colleague, Nagamine would work just as hard, and additionally value whatever input Asagi might contribute. \"You might be right on that.\" Naoya said lightly. \"But with Gamera behaving as erratically as he is, how are we supposed to face the Gyaos or whatever new threat is coming on the horizon?\" \"Even with what he has done, I still trust Gamera.\" Asagi answered. \"I don't know what he'll do next exactly, with whatever's going to threaten Japan about to arrive at some point, but I believe Gamera would make the right move to protect the Earth. He's one of the few if not only forces we can rely on, after all.\" That was certainly true. As much as Gamera's actions in Shibuya have shaken Naoya's trust, he knew logically the only being that could face another monstrous threat short of the emergence of another monster guardian or the military building an advanced superweapon was Gamera. With the Japanese government likely to turn militarily against Gamera in this time of crises, they would need anyone who could at least argue pragmatically the Atlantean guardian was needed if Japan and Earth as humans knew it was going to not be burned to the ground if more malicious monsters came around. Naoya adjusted his posture to the phone and sighed. \"Very well. You may go. But as always, be careful. You do seem to have a knack of getting underfoot of these giant monsters.\" \"Rest assured, I plan not too.\" Asagi said. \"I'll be more detailed about my plans when I pack up to leave. I'll keep in contact as best as I can. Until then…\" Naoya bid goodbye and shut off the phone. After a moment of quiet, he got up and opened the refrigerator to contemplate the sake sitting temptingly in the back. Then he shook his head and got a water bottle, throwing his head back as he drank every drop before wiping his mouth and taking a nice, hot shower. Better to be cautious in these ambiguous times and seek other methods of self-calm, Naoya thought. That way, he would be prepared for work tomorrow and the future calls with his daughter to come. Naoya had been on edge ever since he heard a passenger plane had disappeared over Egypt while flying from Singapore to Germany. The word was the Gyaos might have been responsible and no matter how much Naoya reassured himself Asagi was taking a flight from the American west coast to Japan, news of the Gyaos appearing in Peru and Gamera engaging them didn't help matters. These Gyaos were popping up all over the place like the resurgence of a terrible music fad, unwanted yet unyielding. He was quite worried where they might be reported to pop up next, so Naoya was quite relieved when his dinner making plans were interrupted by his cell ringing. \"So you have settled down, Asagi?\" Naoya asked, as he returned to his cutting board to resume cutting fruit. \"I'm quite thankful to hear your voice. The news seems to be filled with more reports of monster disasters by the minute.\" \"My flight was safe and uneventful, I assure you.\" Asagi replied. \"I'm in the apartment I've booked back in the States with little trouble and have already met with Nagamine-san, and got her phone number. Everything's set.\" \"Good, good.\" Naoya nodded all the while keeping a close eye on the knife and his hand. \"Did you have an interesting conversation with Nagamine-san?\" \"Very. I wished I talked to her more when I met her the first time. We talked about my research into my connection with Gamera, her research into the Gyaos, the mana theory, and what Gamera would do now for the next threat. It was fascinating.\" \"It sounds like it was. I guess all that research has sparked a scientist in you. Or was it Nagamine-san who first planted the idea?\" Naoya chuckled and he could hear Asagi making a similar sound. \"What's this mana thing you mentioned? I don't believe I heard you talk about it before.\" \"Oh, it's a theory I had. It's a belief of the people in the South Pacific that all the living things on earth produces a natural energy.\" \"There are many fascinating beliefs and religions in the world,\" Naoya could chop the fruits automatically now which he was quite relieved and proud of, \"but what makes you say it's a theory? Such belief systems don't usually go under that classifications.\" \"I believe it's something that has been scientifically documented.\" Asagi paused. \"Do you remember reports of the golden aurora-like waves that appeared over Japan before Gamera destroyed Legion?\" \"I do. There were many theories but scientists were baffled about the explanation…\" Naoya trailed off and stopped his cutting as it got clumsy. \"You mean what was being seen in the sky was the life energies of the animals and the plants? Is that a good thing or not?\" \"It was a desperate measure by Gamera and he generally consumes mana.\" Asagi answered. \"The environment is changing, and Japan seems to be a major mana consumer. This caused the Gyaos to wake up and the Legion to go for our country. So Gamera has to use this mana in order to defeat these threats and in the end, there's even less mana.\" Naoya almost thought Asagi's theory was a bit dubious but the more she laid it out, the more puzzle pieces seemed to click in his mind. Yoshinari did have a theory that the Gyaos appeared because of the pollution and the world was still not working fast enough to curb these emissions. Maybe this was effecting the mana levels. Naoya smiled as he gradually resumed cutting. \"You got me there. There's still some parts you might want to research but this could become a good paper when you return to college.\" But Naoya's smile slipped. \"It sounds like Earth's in a downward spiral, though, with the feedback loop of less mana summoning monsters and Gamera needing more mana to defeat them…I don't see how that's going to be good for the human race or your college education.\" \"So you think the world, or at least the human race, might come to an end.\" Asagi said. \"I think we'll go down that road if we don't do something to stop our actions. However, people are fighting back. It might seem like a futile fight but seemingly futile fights have often become inevitable victories before. Gamera has done the same, so he's not that different from us. I believe we shouldn't stop fighting to make a better world that will bring us away from this brink.\" After all Naoya had seen, a part of him wanted to doubt Asagi's youthful optimism. Still, conditions in Japan and other parts of the world have improved when people screamed loud enough to frighten those in power to change said conditions. Granted, the current world problems would require a lot more coordinated screaming to overturn them but if there was a will, there was a way. \"You should get paid for those speeches.\" Naoya said. \"I bet that would make certain financial problems easier.\" \"I guess that means I convinced you.\" Asagi chuckled. \"I need to get some groceries, so I'll call you back tomorrow. Would that be okay with you?\" \"It'll be fine.\" Naoya said. \"I need to get some sleep myself, after I have a delicious dinner. I look forward to what updates you might bring tomorrow.\" Father and daughter bid farewell once again and Naoya lived up to his word of going to bed after having quite a delicious meal indeed (Naoya was quite proud of how his cooking skills blossomed). This time he didn't feel any pull toward the refrigerator to cope with the stress of this strange world. All he needed as he closed his eyes under his bedcovers were the encouraging words of Asagi that hope wasn't futile but possible in all sorts of ways even in this grim, changing world. \"There's another girl with a bead like yours?\" Well, hope was possible in all sorts of ways indeed if this came up the very next night. Naoya attempted to tamp down his excitement. After hearing news of several mysterious deaths in a village in Nara, Naoya was starting to come down from the high Asagi's words had given him. Now yet another threat was rearing its ugly head when there was already so many methods for the world to be plunged into an apocalypse. But when Asagi called and informed him Nagamine had found a girl with a certain familiar bead, Naoya couldn't help but sit up with renewed hope. \"It's colored black but Nagamine-san told me it was identical to the one I used to wear.\" Asagi said. \"The girl was unconscious when she saw her. I have no idea of its origin or how she got it but I'm interested.\" \"Do you believe she might be connected to another guardian monster?\" Naoya asked. \"Or…another Gamera? There was the recent discovery of a Gamera graveyard at the bottom of the sea.\" \"Maybe.\" Asagi sounded dubious. \"There could be other monsters whose duty is to protect the Earth. We won't know until we learn more about her.\" \"What do we know?\" \"She was a resident of that village. She was rushed to the hospital, with her brother accompanying her, after she fell unconscious and this was shortly before most of the village was mysteriously killed. Her guardians are among the dead.\" Oh. That put a pin to the balloon that was Naoya's swelling hope. He could only imagine what this girl's reaction would be if she regained conscious and learned the news. Her brother must be devastated. It certainly brought home the danger toward those who get involved in this monster business. That must be among Asagi's worst fears, to lose her father to such an attack. Naoya counted themselves fortunate no such monster-related tragedies have yet to strike them. The passing of his dear wife happened long before all these giants started emerging in this world. As sad as that was, Naoya hoped that was the only tragedy that would ever befall the pair. \"I'm sorry to hear that. They seem to have barely entered this world of monsters and have already suffered loss. Maybe whatever committed those murders is trying to prevent another guardian from entering the scene.\" \"That's a possibility.\" Asagi said. \"I'm going to that village tomorrow to see if anymore has been learned. If this girl is like me, I want to help.\" \"Go to that village?\" Naoya asked nervously. \"You mean the one with the mysterious deaths?\" \"I would be with Nagamine-san the entire stay.\" Naoya closed his eyes and shook his head. \"I trust you both to exercise your utmost caution then. Give Nagamine-san my regards.\" When Naoya ended the call, he was feeling far more mixed emotions than he would have liked. What happened to the girl with the bead was horrible but he couldn't help but hope there was another guardian monster that could aide or even take the place of Gamera after the sea monster's reckless actions in Shibuya. If there was such a monster, hopefully they would be more considerate of the tiny humans beneath their feet (or wings?) in the possible scenario they had to walk through a city to engage with a menace. Naoya went to sleep with dreams of a Gamera-like creature sheepishly tip-toing through Tokyo streets toward the latest threat. In the next day or so, Naoya grew increasingly nervous as reports of more deaths around that Nara village started being aired on the news. There were rumors of some creature that was neither Gyaos nor Legion causing the deaths. That pretty much torpedoed any hope of another monster coming in to be humanity's ally like Gamera. As he checked the wall clock in his apartment, Naoya wondered what was taking Asagi. She should be with Nagamine in Nara by now. Did this attack delay her from being able to make an international call? She had her own cell phone he partly funded that should get some good reception but who knew how this possible new threat might interrupt the signal. So Naoya waited as midnight soon approached, distracting himself with the news and amusing infomercial programming that hawked the next generation of food making or house cleaning. *If only there was a reliable next generation method of dealing with monsters.* Naoya thought. *I'm sure there would be many who would buy that item in a heartbeat.* The ring of Naoya's phone came so suddenly, it startled him out of his reverie. He clumsily took the phone and pressed the button to accept the call. \"Hi Dad.\" Asagi said breathlessly. \"Sorry to be calling you so late but I barely had any time to get to you. It was so busy.\" \"I sort of heard.\" Naoya glanced at the clock to see it was 12:30 am. \"I've heard there was some danger in your area. Are you okay?\" \"We've only heard a bit but it never went near us. We're currently on a train to Kyoto to retrieve the girl with the bead, Ayana-chan. She has been taken from the hospital she was at for some strange reason and after what we are starting to piece together, we're really worried about her.\" \"How do you mean? Like they want to use her and the monster she might be connected with as a weapon against the Gyaos or Gamera or –\" Naoya stopped as the content of her last sentence sank in. \"Or was the monster this girl was connected to always a weapon against Gamera.\" \"We don't know about the particular details but that seems to be the case.\" Asagi replied. \"From the reports of a boy whose family guarded a shrine near the village, DNA from that place that indicates a creature was there that was similar to a Gyaos, and Ayana-chan's younger brother saying she holds a grudge against Gamera because of the death of their parents, it seems pretty likely the monster who killed so many might be the same one she's currently bonded to.\" \"Damn.\" Naoya wiped his mouth nervously. Well, this hope the girl had bonded with a monster who could become an ally to humanity was turned on its head in the worst way possible. \"You're saying this Ayana girl has been having this monster kill fellow villagers and engage with the military?\" \"If I were to guess, I'd say this monster was using her hatred of Gamera as energy. From the brain scans Nagamine-san talked about, it seems Ayana-chan isn't quite aware of what's going on. We're going to take her to some type of hospital and have her connection with the monster disconnected before anyone else, including herself, get hurt.\" \"I guess it would be too optimistic to say this group is trying to do just that for this Ayana-chan.\" Naoya said halfheartedly. \"If that were the case, they should have remained in contact with Nagamine-san and her team.\" Asagi said. \"I'm aware from your work that parts of government can have trouble communicating with each other but from the way this went down, I'm trusting Nagamine-san's instinct that there's more to this. We're going to take Ayana-chan to safety.\" \"Are these people dangerous?\" Naoya nervously asked. \"If they spirited her off like that, it does sound like they would use some extreme measures in order to get the results they desire.\" \"We don't know. We'll see when we arrive at the station. It does seem like they might be willing to cooperate with us. But I'm more concerned with the danger that revolves around handling Ayana-chan. The monster attempted to fuse with her before she was rescued. and the killing spree followed. Attempting to cut down their connection could lead to a reaction that could be quite dangerous.\" So Asagi was going to be probably in the middle of a highly dangerous situation again. Great. Naoya wiped his lips further, wondering what had been done in a previous life to lead to such a bizarre and tumultuous situation now. \"Be careful. I know you and Nagamine-san are exercising caution but nevertheless…\" \"Rest assured, we don't plan on being reckless in this delicate time.\" There was a pause, as though Asagi was whispering with someone nearby. She continued. \"We're nearly at Kyoto. I'll get back to you when I can. Get some sleep.\" \"Okay. Good luck.\" When Naoya put the phone back in its place, he stood up and went to the fridge. He opened the door, staring at a pack of sake in the back. The alcoholic beverages seemed to call for him. He reached out and pulled one bottle out of the pack, popping the cap off. He tipped the bottle and hesitated. Then he put the bottle opening to his lips and only took a few gulps of the alcohol. Naoya replaced the bottle in the pack and closed the fridge. Naoya wasn't going to dare get drunk off his butt with his job on the horizon but he needed the pleasant buzz to set in to deal with the inexplicable crises that were building up over these past weeks. Naoya collapsed into bed and planned to get as much sleep as he could. Naoya attempted to ignore the exhaustion in his eyelids and the headache faintly pulsing in his temples as he concentrated on his work. At the moment, work was mostly about filling out computer forms and sending emails, so the only problem was misspelling words or calling someone by the wrong name. It was tedious but Naoya felt he wouldn't be up to any more vigorous work and it did occupy his mind. He only held the merest traces of his worries about Asagi as the morning passed and lunch was announced around noon. He joined his colleagues in the break room, breaking out his bento and filling his hungry stomach as chatter soon rose around him. \"Hey Naoya, you seem pretty calm right now. \"A coworker, Sandy, said. \"More sleep deprived than calm but I'm happy about the slow day.\" Naoya said with a sheepish smile. \"But haven't you heard what's been happening in Japan?\" \"No, I woke up late and was in too much of a rush to listen to the news.\" Sandy looked incredulous. \"Kyoto's basically in ruins!\" Naoya just barely stopped himself from spraying his rice on the table and his coworkers' lunches. Instead he choked on his food and those eating beside him gave hasty back pats that helped him swallow down the rice. He waved off offers of water as he raised his own bottle and drank to clear his throat. \"Sorry about that.\" Naoya gasped. \"What was that about Kyoto being in ruins?\" \"Gamera had a fight with some monster and it basically blew up a lot of that city.\" Sandy continued. \"Then every Gyaos that had been terrorizing the world for the past year seemed to converge there and fight Gamera. It's still going on right now.\" Naoya listened while a cold sweet overtook his skin. Asagi had spoken of her and Nagamine going to Japan's ancient capital to retrieve this Ayana girl. There was suspicion there might be some danger in such an operation but for yet another monster battle to take place during the half day while he had been snoring away and working at boring computer work threw him for a loop. Naoya took a moment to take another bite of rice with his chopsticks while he processed this. \"Can anyone turn on a TV or radio here?\" Naoya asked. The others looked around but only a radio sitting on the small fridge was available. A coworker, Frank, reached over to turn it on and fiddled through the channels until a panicked garbled voice provided the news Naoya was looking for. \"…mass exodus from the city of Kyoto as Gamera battles the many Gyaos. It seems like every street and tunnel is packed with people trying to get out of here. With flights grounded over not only Japan but the general pacific area, citizens can't leave as quickly as might be necessary, always on the lookout for a Gyaos about to eat them or explode onto the ground after being vaporized by Gamera. There are also tanks and fighter jets, firing upon the Gyaos, assisting Gamera, a marked change from the policy of the last week. Gamera himself, wounded and bleeding, is fighting on and seems to be even doing his best to protect the civilians who get in the line of fire –\" The newswoman, presumably reporting on location in Kyoto, continued her report but Naoya pulled out the latest cell phone he got. He had informed Asagi of its number in case Naoya wasn't at home. Mostly used for work, it did come in handy during those rare moments father and daughter needed to talk. New he checked for any messages and was disappointed nothing was there. \"Checking any messages from your daughter?\" Frank asked. \"Yeah.\" Naoya replied faintly. \"She just went back to Japan to do work with a family acquaintance.\" \"If she's staying in Tokyo like while you all lived there, then there shouldn't be that much trouble, right? I mean, Japan's going through hell right now but from what I hear its capital sounds like it's safe.\" \"You're not wrong there.\" Naoya said. He didn't feel like informing his coworkers of his daughter's actual whereabouts. \"I hope she calls soon. Now let's finish lunch so we can go back to work.\" Sandy, Frank, and the other coworkers eyed him oddly but Naoya put most of his attention to finishing his rice and keeping his mouth too busy finishing the rest of his meal to contribute any further conversation. But as he returned to his desk and resumed his work, whispers still flitted about concerning Gamera's battle with the Gyaos, wondering if the latter could be defeated and if they would attack any other country enmasse like that. Despite himself, Naoya checked his cell phone every few minutes for messages. Asagi was most likely busy evacuating Kyoto with Nagamine and the Ayana girl. There would be little time to make a call, never mind the cell phone interference a battle in the city would produce. She would probably be in the thick of this monster drama like many times before. Yet no matter how much Naoya worried, he couldn't think that Asagi wasn't still alive out there somewhere. She would fight to remain among the living and make sure her friends and any nearby innocence would remain in the same state. Asagi wanted to do many more things with her life and she didn't want to leave any of her loved ones behind. So Naoya sent his emails and went through spreadsheets with that assurance in mind, not allowing the passing minutes of silence affect him. Naoya became so wrapped up in his work, double-checking a business list to make sure one institution was still doing work with his company, that he nearly missed the ringing from his pants pocket. Naoya grabbed his cell phone and flipped it open, ignoring the looks from nearby coworkers. He had built a good reputation in this insurance agency and word probably spread he was worried about his daughter visiting Japan anyway. \"Is that you, Asagi?\" Naoya said breathlessly. \"Are you alright?\" \"More or less.\" Asagi's voice came out a bit distorted. \"We're all outside of Kyoto and taken shelter. We're a bit bruised and battered but alive and waiting out the fight going on out there.\" \"So as chaotic as I heard on the news.\" Naoya said. \"How are Nagamine-san and…have you managed to get that Ayana girl?\" \"Nagamine-san is also fine. I think a doctor might need to look at her foot at some point but…I think a doctor needs to look at everyone here. We managed to get Ayana-chan back with the help of a boy from the village, Moribe. They're both physically well but mentally…it's a long road ahead, especially for Ayana-chan.\" \"So she's aware of what happened?\" Naoya asked. \"Lucidly so.\" Asagi paused. \"She hasn't been talking much but we're really worried about her. She's probably blaming herself for what happened. I have the sense she's going to need a good psychiatrist for the next decade or two in order to cope with this horrible experience as healthily as possible.\" \"And a psychiatrist who wouldn't be intimidated by her circumstances or blab it to the whole public.\" Naoya replied. \"If the world found out about her, I can't even imagine the endless harassment and death threats she would be on the receiving end of.\" \"Nagamine-san is already preparing to deal with that. She hasn't said much but I wouldn't be surprised if she was already mentally drawing up her list of contacts to place her and her brother somewhere safe and private where people wouldn't ask too many questions. I'm sure Moribe would want to be there too. He did risk his life to rescue her and, even with much of his family gone now, he seems very concerned about her.\" Naoya was amazed someone who sounded like he was a still teenager was able to act so selflessly. Naoya could still remember his own youth and, though he wouldn't have considered himself a hooligan, he was very much into his own interests like many teenagers were. \"That's very kind of him. I wish this Moribe the best. And after all the work she has done, I have little doubt Nagamine-san possesses some good contacts that would make sure those three children would be well taken care of and get the resources they need. I have a feeling Nagamine-san would keep contact with them personally.\" \"She won't be the only one to do so.\" Asagi said hesitantly. \"I haven't talked with Nagamine-san about this but I want to help her keep watch over them. It would be best if Ayana-chan's with as many trustworthy people she knew as possible. Since we're one of the few who have regular dealings with monsters and their trauma revolves around that Gyaos mutant, that would hopefully be the best.\" \"Wait.\" Naoya said. \"Are you saying you're going to stay and help raise several traumatized children only a few years younger than you?\" \"It doesn't rule out me coming back to America to see you and other people…but only for short periods. I'm not sure if I would be able to really move back to the country to continue my studies anytime soon.\" Naoya paused and raised a hand down in a calming motion while moving his lips silently, wanting to follow the advice he was about to give to his daughter. \"Please think about this more slowly and carefully, Asagi. I understand how concerned you are about these children but this is a lifelong commitment. You need more time to consider something that would impact both you and these children. You remember how long I talked about moving to America and whether you should come with me or stay behind to finish your studies. This is much bigger than that and should be thought about especially when a war isn't happening not that far from where you are.\" \"I understand your worry.\" Asagi said. \"I'm not going to stop thinking about this decision but the more time that passes, the more firm I feel I must do this. I have the feeling that would be the case a day or week from now. Don't worry about my education. I believe I can continue my studies here. Japan has good universities as much as any other place does.\" That would be true but nevertheless that wasn't the crux of the issue. \"Have you any idea of how to take care of traumatized children? It takes a lot of special care in order to have them grow up to be healthy adults and even then, they would still need assistance to cope with the trauma. You have to say the right words and do the right things in order to not inadvertently hurt them. Are you sure you want to take such a huge responsibility?\" \"I will do the research necessary and ask advice from those who know what they are doing.\" Asagi replied. \"I know of the difficulties ahead and I might make mistakes along the way. Still…I can't just leave these children after all they have been through and how much Nagamine-san and I fought to save them from this predicament, especially Ayana-chan. I'll work hard to do good for them. I'll help in any way I can to make them happy. I know others would want to help too but I want to play my part. Maybe my connection with Gamera would be of some use to helping Ayana-chan heal. Whatever the case, it's not something I want to back down from. I won't give up on them. I won't.\" The last two words were said with added pressure and firmness. Asagi didn't raise her voice but she didn't need to when she was determined about something. Naoya felt his own worry wavering before that confidence. He had always been a bit unnerved whenever Asagi displayed such adult-like conviction beyond her years but as he saw those decisions bear fruit more often than not, he started to trust her judgements. Naoya still questioned and worried like any other parent but he trusted she wouldn't do anything drastic like anyone else her age. Nevertheless, this would be one of the more monumental of her decisions and not many would be able to commit, never mind someone who wasn't even twenty yet. She had made mistakes before and she could make some major ones again. Yet her insistence in front of his opposition and probably the opposition of others was filled with more strength than any moment before monsters emerged into the world. Her dealings with Gamera made her stronger and more confident. Naoya couldn't doubt Asagi would do all she could to help Ayana and the others recover from their trauma and he felt some pride rise up to mix with the worry. Naoya gave a final sigh as his mind settled. \"I will suggest you take your time to think about this.\" Naoya said finally. \"Learn everything you can about the process. However, if you're still determined to do this in the days and weeks ahead, I'm not going to stop you.\" \"Dad.\" Asagi's smile was clear. \"Thanks.\" \"It's not like I could stop you anyway.\" Naoya added lightly. \"You make so many of these brave decisions while I'm away, where my attempts to protect you are limited to words. Though maybe my words could be of some help. As a parent, I could give advice on how to approach Ayana-chan and the others. Though our traumas are different, I could draw on the loss of my wife and your mother to help give some guidance. At the very least, I could draw up from my own contacts who will be willing to assist you in this enormous task.\" \"I'll keep that offer in mind. I wouldn't be surprised if I might need to use it. For now, I'll just think about giving comfort to Ayana-chan and the others now while Gamera has his own fight.\" Silence fell between them. In this talk between father and daughter about the trauma of those who dealt with the Gyaos mutant and how to cope with that trauma, the fact Gamera's battle with the Gyaos continued had been thrust far into the back of Naoya's mind. Not forgotten but a bit ignored in favor of smaller and more personal human issues. The fact that fight was going on not far away from Asagi and the others' current location was soon comprehensible to Naoya's brain. An army. Gamera and the Japanese military was fighting an army of Gyaos made up of all the individuals who popped up from around the world. He could only imagine the carnage being reigned on Kyoto. It was a miracle Asagi and the others not only survived the battle between Gamera and the Gyaos mutant but managed to flee just as that next fight with the Gyaos army started, while apparently being little worse for physical wear. \"I'm very thankful you and the others survived such a harrowing experience.\" Naoya said. \"Just sit and heal in all the meaning of the word and if you're offered medical assistance, don't turn it down even if your bruises seem minor. Any surprise serious injuries could throw a major wrench in any plans you're thinking up.\" \"We'll keep that in mind.\" Asagi said. \"But in addition to having Nagamine-san's foot checked, I feel Ayana-chan might need an examination of her body to see if there's any additional effects to fusing with that creature. Fortunately, Gamera pulled her out and revived her before anything noticeable happened, and he fought against the Gyaos in a way that limited any damage to fleeing civilians.\" \"Yeah, I've heard on the radio.\" Naoya's mind reeled from the news Ayana had been fused with that mutant and was somehow still alive but he concentrated on the more immediate events. \"He seems more careful now about the wellbeing of humans, as reported. I hope he would be able to continue that streak even with the overwhelming number of Gyaos he has to fight. I can't even imagine how he would be able to defeat them all.\" \"I believe he would be able to.\" Asagi said firmly. \"He was hurt pretty badly when he fought the Gyaos mutant – even sacrificed a hand in order to win – but he seemed to be getting his second wind when he was blasting the Gyaos out of the sky and making other Gyaos fall into their burning compatriots. Gamera has taken some damage from that but he won't give up and he would triumph.\" \"You have a lot of faith in him.\" Naoya allowed himself a smile. \"These seem like especially overwhelming odds. Would he be able to win despite all that is stacked against him this time too?\" \"I do. I saw how he fought against the mutant and what he did to save Ayana-chan and the rest of us. Even when he walked away tired, that same determination was still in his eyes. Though I can't read his heart anymore, I can tell he won't give up and his will would triumph over these odds. Do you believe the same?\" Naoya was about to say sheepishly he had some doubts but his memory of Gamera's many battles came in. From the way Gamera first fought against Gyaos despite military interference; healing his daughter and easing the connection once the battle was won; protecting the helicopter containing evacuees like Asagi from the advance of the Legion; and seeming to come back from the dead in order to finish the score with the Legion. Gamera pulled out all the stops to defeat his enemy and defend those he cared about. With this Gyaos mutant, it sounded like Gamera tackled the enemy with the same determination and energy, and was employing that drive in his fight with the army of Gyaos, never mind his lack of a hand. Naoya took a deep breath. \"Yeah.\" Naoya said. \"Now I do too.\" Naoya sat on his couch and picked up the newspaper, taking his time as he read about events of the world with a relaxed eye. He hadn't yet retired but he was winding down on his work with the insurance agency, giving advice when he could and occasionally going in when needing to refile work he was familiar with. Naoya thought he was beginning to enjoy this new routine where he could move at a leisurely pace, going through his bills and taking in the news, as well as getting back in touch with old friends and doing his hobbies. He was in contact with Yoshinari and they had a good time exchanging amusing anecdotes about their professions, and cooking and wine tips for when they were in a culinary mood. He was also in contact with his daughter. She had finished her education and was still helping Ayana and the others as they recovered. From what Asagi said, those three were showing signs of improvement and were getting along with their therapists. Becoming a bit more self-reliant and with Nagamine helping in between her travel and research on the Gyaos, Asagi found time to visit her father and catch up. He had also found time to do the same by returning to Japan. Naoya was quite proud of the work he saw in Ayana and the others' healthier condition and the good papers she sent out about her research into Gamera. She seemed right where she wanted to be. He scanned over a small article about strange tide currents in the Pacific Ocean and sighed as he looked to the next page. Humanity still needed to get its act together when it came to global warming. Even with all the monster threats that emerged partially because of pollution, governments were dragging their feet on taking the steps needed to avoid a climatic apocalypse. At the rate they were going, Naoya wouldn't be exactly surprised if Gamera started smashing up oil and coal company installations and headquarters. The only reason Naoya would be against that destruction would be it would only exasperate the pollution problem. If it hadn't, he wouldn't have disapproved too much. Speaking of the guardian sea monster, he had been barely sighted these last several years. After nearly collapsing when the last of the Gyaos fell from the sky unmoving, Gamera had took off and fell into the deeper waters of the ocean as soon as he reached them. The military attempted to follow, merely to keep a watch over the sea monster, but soon lost him in the Pacific. Now every month or so, there would be a report of Gamera being picked up on sonar or sighted surfacing near a boat or shoreline, only lingering a few minutes before returning to the depths. The guardian sea monster must be taking his time healing and enjoying his long rest from any sort of battle. Naoya was also relieved Japan was getting a long rest from monster attacks. After the fall of the Gyaos mutant Ayana dubbed as Irys and the whole Gyaos horde, Japan started the process of rebuilding Kyoto as well as its many cities still under construction. One of the few positives of these attacks was they started an infrastructure boom that was getting people jobs and boosting the economy after the nineties slump. Naoya had heard news of reinforcing these new structures in preparation for earthquakes of greater magnitude as well as typhoons and flooding. Maybe it would minimize potential causalities from future disasters in a changing world. From the protests about public housing, hopefully it could also minimize the homeless and sub-standardly housed populations. As Naoya scanned a few other articles, he initially didn't notice the phone ringing in the background. It was only on the fourth ring that Naoya started and he scrambled out of his chair just barely on the sixth ring. \"Sorry for almost not catching the call.\" Naoya said. \"The morning news can be quite engrossing.\" \"As I've come to learn in these few years.\" Asagi said. \"How are you?\" \"I've been doing well. I was called in the office yesterday to help Sandy double check on how a fishing trolley sustained damage in the gulf but otherwise I've been catching up with world events and looking to see if I could talk to Yoshinari about clarifying that new recipe he sent me. What of you?\" \"I've also been doing well.\" Asagi paused. \"Ayana and the others have been doing great with their schoolwork. I've seen their grade reports and I'm quite proud. Maybe they can go to college one day like me. They still might need some supervision. As for me, I had an interesting talk about doing further research on my connection to Gamera and the state of Atlantean technology after the collection of Gamera DNA samples and retrieved artifacts from where the Gamera graveyard is.\" \"That's good. I look forward to the results of that research when they become public. It's a good thing they were able to get these Atlantean artifacts before those strange currents started coming in.\" \"Yeah.\" Asagi laughed nervously. \"That was good timing indeed.\" Naoya frowned at that tone. \"Was someone able to determine the cause of those strange currents?\" \"Um, I'm not exactly sure, but…\" \"You know what's going on.\" \"I don't know the exact particulars but yeah.\" Asagi admitted. Naoya found a growing, familiar nervousness appearing in his stomach after a long absence. \"So what are the generals of this phenomena?\" \"Well…Dad, have you heard of giant squids?\" \"Yes. They were considered mythological for a long while until fishermen started finding their corpses and I believe there was verifiable footage of them several years back. Why do you ask?\" \"Um.\" Asagi hesitated. \"Silver creatures that are like giants squids are showing up at the bottom of the Pacific. They are even larger than those giant squids and are basically displaying intelligence and powers far beyond any normal animal. And from the way they change ocean currents, they don't appear friendly either.\" Naoya closed his eyes, resisting the urge to rub his forehead. \"Please don't tell me they are going for Japan.\" \"They're deep in the ocean at the moment but from the reports I'm hearing, they seem to be coming in our direction. I highly suspect Gamera would get involved in this potential battle.\" \"And if Gamera goes against the squids, then…\" Naoya trailed off. There was an affirmative sound on the other end. \"Then I might get involved as well. These creatures might have something to do with Atlantis and Gamera, so my study might be needed. I know you hoped this wouldn't happen again after all these years of peace but…\" Naoya was silent for a moment as the weight of the scenario she described sank in. Giant silver squids from the depths of the largest ocean, with mysterious abilities to control ocean currents, and with a possible connection to that mysterious Atlantis. It was ridiculous, the supposed existence of these hostile creatures. So ridiculous. And yet Gamera and his daughter were going to be involved with them, in a likely life or death battle. Naoya just shook his head at the whole surreal scenario. Still, at this point in his life, exasperation was starting to match his fatherly worry and he sighed in wonder. \"Okay.\" Naoya said. \"I know after all these years you can take care of yourself. But be careful. I'll hear from you when you're available and decide to inform me of how events are progressing. Bye, Asagi.\" \"Bye, Dad. Don't worry. I'll definitely be around to give you that update.\" The connection disconnected and Naoya replaced the phone in its proper place. Then he returned to his seat and unfolded the newspaper a second time, attempting to be calm and once again wait for the next call Asagi would give to update him on what weird events she was in the middle of this time.

Santa Claus. Starting from his arbitrary home base near Okinawa, Japan, Gamara tucked his limbs and head into his carbonaceous shell and lit his unexplainable limb jets and spun off through the air to the North Pole, Santa's base of evil. He arrived in due time and landed in the snow outside. The reindeer bucked and whinnied as he shrieked his imprecations at the door. \"Come out, Old Man!\" Gamera said, and his mouth continued to move after his voice stopped. \"I have come to defeat your great evil! You bring harm upon the children of the earth! I am Gamera, Friend to Children! I am their protector! I will defeat you, and save the children!\" Again his mouth continued to move past the time his voice ceased to sound. Santa, red suit and all, came stumbling out of the front door of the little Swiss chalet. He blinked up at the towering turtle, shielding his eyes against the swirling snow as the reindeer continued to panic. \"Whoa, Blitzen, easy, Prancer…\" he said, and his mouth moved too much, as well. He called up to Gamera. \"I do not understand what you mean. I am not harming the children. I reward them for being well-behaved all year long.\" \"You bribe them, and then you fail to uphold your own rules. You reward them whether they have been naughty or nice,\" Gamera said. \"They know this, and so your bribery fails to illicit good behavior from them. You have created generations of spoiled brats with hearts that know naught but greed and avarice. I will stop you. I will save the children so that they once more can learn of love and kindness and sharing.\" Santa blinked up at the turtle some more. \"How is it you can speak, Gamera? You never could before.\" \"I always could, but the people could not understand me. You can understand me, because you are magical. But that will avail you not, for I will destroy you nevertheless. Haikiba!\" And Gamera leapt upward and came down hard on the lower edge of his shell, creating a powerful earthquake that split the glaciers and knocked the reindeer and Santa on their asses. Gamera took a moment to perform the \"Gamera Go-Go,\" the dance he did whenever he scored a point against a foe. Santa climbed to his feet. From the doorway of the chalet, Mrs. Claus shouted , \"Sweep the leg, Nicky!\" \"You're not the only one who can fight, Gamera. Hi-ya!\" Santa said, and performed a flawless roundhouse kick that would have been highly effective had his opponent not been two hundred feet tall. Instead, the impact crushed his heel. He hopped on one foot crying in pain for a few moments until he regained composure. He limped to the chalet door and looked back at Gamera. \"You are indeed strong, but I have seen all of your movies and I know all of your weaknesses. I know all of the monsters that have fought you and how they nearly defeated you.\" \"Nearly, but never have,\" Gamera said. \"And how would that help you? Those monsters are all dead now, they cannot fight for you.\" \"No, but I have something just as good. Official Limited Edition movie merchandise! Stinky! Droopy! Doc! Load the sleigh! Quicky! Chop chop! Oo, watch the foot!\" In a matter of moments the sleigh was in the air, and Gamera was at a disadvantage trying to keep track of the swift-moving reindeer flying about his head. \"First, how about the Official Guiron Shuriken, Gamera? You really liked those, didn't you?\" Santa said, and threw a pair of giant pointy metal plates at Gamera's face. Gamera ducked down into his shell just in time. \"Oh, all right, then how about the Zigra Paralyzing Beam?\" He shot a laser gun at Gamera's head but again the turtle ducked into his shell in time to negate the effect. \"Well, there's always the Guiron Ginsu Knives,\" Santa said, and pulled out a one-hundred foot butcher's knife. The sleigh dropped altitude and Santa sliced across Gamera's undershell, scoring deeply. Gamera shrieked and waved his arms. One of them connected and knocked the knife out of Santa's hands. The sleigh caromed out of control. \"Ah ha! I have you in my power now!\" Gamera said, and his mouth kept moving. \"Fat man, prepare to die!\" \"Noooo!\" Santa said, and pulled out the Official Limited Gaos Laser and fired it at Gamera's head. It scored a deep wound, and Gamera bled dish soap blue, but the turtle was not dissuaded. He opened his mouth and let out a great breath of flame, and it was Santa-kabobs for everyone. A chorus of a million high-pitched Japanese children began to sing somewhere in the distance. 1, 2, 3, 4, Kick that fat man out the door! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera is really neat! He is filled with turtle meat! We all love you, Gamera! Gamera tucked his rear legs into his body and used his rear jets to propel himself into the air and off into the endless Arctic night. Justice was served. Violence was committed. The children were safe. The children were safe.

Gamera 3. But rather then Gamera being the good guy, and Iris/Irys being evil, could we all be wrong? ' How can that be!' You all cry. ' Gamera saved that kid in Shibuya in that movie!' True, but this fic releases a reason for that. So now, With slight tweakage, role reversal has taken place in the lines of kaiju… \"Woe to them that call good evil, and evil good, Darkness light, and light darkness, sweet as bitter, and bitter as sweet.\" Isaiah 5:20 -Gamera- Pesky humans and their pesky cities. Why, if it weren't for them, their wouldn't be a species like the Gaos, would there? The giant turtle landed right on top of a subway station. So what, some died? I wouldn't care if they all died. My only primary goal is to save this planet from it's destruction. The ancient relic from another era looked down at his primary rival, a half-burnt gaos, partially trapped under rubble, and now, screeching at him, taunting him to kill the wounded bird-like creature. IF there was one bad thing to do, it was taunt the legendary guardian. Gamera readied a fireball in his mouth, and unleashed it, point-blank range at the dying creature, consuming the surrounding area in a blazing inferno. The sounds of the various people screaming was of nothing to the turtle. Pushing some half-charred building remains out of his way, he looked aloft, only to see a gaos firing a laser at a young boy. The first instinct was to merely blast it out of the sky, but he then remembered how much the small human's explosions hurt. His stomach would feel inside-out, the pain racketing his body. A ton of those explosions, again, would be agonizing. To make himself look good and to fore-stall a probable attack, he stuck out his hand, merely deflecting the laser to the side, where it impacted another structure, and it crumbled. But danm, did it ever hurt. Enough! The fire-breathing turtle unleashed a fireball, and just barely missed the gaos. A second one proved to be a miss also, but he was disturbing the kaiju's flight pattern. As he did so, he intentionally mowed over some several thousand people, hoping to lessen the strain they put on the planet. Eventually, he had it trapped. That kaiju was forced to fly straight upward, and so it did, and with two mighty shots, it exploded, the beast gone, it's fiery remains falling toward the ground. With no further work to be done here, the large kaiju pulled his legs up into his shell, and flew away, leaving the pitiful humans in their pitiful state. -Iris- The small creature was slowly traversing through the forest, having just finished it's meal of a fox. *A/N I don't know if it was a fox he killed, but I'll just assume it was.* Satisfied for now at least, he lied down to rest. The reason he left the cave into the dimming sunlight of the Nara Prefecture was merely to find it's surrogate Mother. She had taught him everything he could do, and help him in ways she'd never understand. Every touched that she planted on him allowed him to feel into the recesses of her mind, finding guilt, sorrow, and hatred. These three emotions were driven even deeper by what seemed to be love, but how that could be, he couldn't reason even. He wasn't supposed to be a thinker. Still, he was left with something to do at least. But that even ended as he heard the familiar voice out a distance ahead of him. Stretching his neck up, he was the human that had brought him to this point. \"Oh Iris, I'm so sorry.\" Sorry about what? \"It was my fault.\" What was? Sensing she was in distress, he stood up to it's full height. He could tell the hatred and mourning were very forefront in her mind right now. About that time, he decided that it was no longer time to try and comfort. Something had to be done about this problem she had. A pair of what appeared to be shoulders jutted out of his sides, along with several extra tentacles. To figure out who or what the assailant was that continued being a problem, he wrapped his tentacles from behind, ignoring her remarks about heat, and pulled her in closer, inserting right into her memory banks. There, he saw the one thing that caused the death of what appeared to be the family she had. The giant turtle's head was etched into her mind well, and he copied the image into his own brain. Gamera. That thing caused the only thing that had been with him for his life so much pain. He must kill it, at all costs…To avenge Ayana. Short. Yes. Simple, Yes. To the point? Yes. Good? You decide, and tell me in a review. Thank you! ","Summary":" An interesting twist. Gamera 3.

Two tribes Swelik and Tyresk. They were always at war. One day the Swelik prayed to they're gods that they sent a gaurdian, for many days they went afraid and without sleep because of the Tyresk's midnight attacks. One morning the Tyresk's unexpectedly attacked the Swelik and killed several people all unrested and unprepared. But as all hope seemed lost a chilling roar was heard. And landing from the air like a bird was a massive beast taller than the tallest of the temples that stood at 30 feet. The beast however towered over them at hundreds of feet. It looked like a massive black turtle standing on two legs with tusks petruding from the sides of its mouth. Roaring once more the mighty beast opened his mouth and from his gaping jaw came a large ball if fire. To shocked to react the Tyresk's army took the full force of the blast which charred and killed the majority of the Tyresk forces. The few remaing simply ran back to they're land. The Swelik thanked the turtle beast whom wonderously withdrew its arms and legs into its shell and flew off like a bird. From here on out the Tyresk could not attack the Swelik without being attacked themselves by the massive turtle beast dubbed Gamera the Gaurdian by one of the Swalik. So they decided to pray for a force to counter Gamera. Thus they prayed to the spirits of the underworld to come up with they're own anti-gaurdian. Whom they had decided ahead of time to call Nitaishite. Thus the next day a the Tyresk gathered everyone they could and assaulted the Swelik. When Gamera arrived to protect the Swelik so did Nitaishite. A massive Toad like creature with armored red and green bumpy skin. The two tribes feared if they got in the way they would get crushed in the crossfire and thus simply let the beasts fight. The two beast clashed as Gamera lifted the frog beast and slammed it on its back. But the frog used its extremely powerful legs to knock Gamers off and send the turtle beast flying into the air. Quickly Nitaishite stands and uses its tongue to grab the falling tortoise and slam it into the ground. Completely demolishing a temple it lands on. Nitaishite pulls Gamera towards it. But Gamera extends his legs and kicks Nitaishite square in the face sending the beast tumbling back. From then on the two beasts exchange blows destroying all around them in the crossfire and even unkowingly killing the innocent bystanders. The fight raged on for days, both monsters seemed too evenly matched so both sides came to an agreement. They came up with a plan to dig the deepest hole of all and trap both beasts down in it forever. Day and night fo 8 days straight they dug and dug and dug until they couldn't dig anymore. The two monsters brawl eventually crossed over the hole and unfortunately for them they fell down. Deep into the depths of the hole. However right before they fell Gamera jabbed his hand into Nitaishite's mouth and riipped out it's toungue. The two sides began covering the hole with water and mud. They filled it as much as they could and then built a temple over it to protect it from rain as it hardened. The two sides were so glad of their success they declared peace amongst the tribes. Year 2015 Society is living peacefully. Things are much more advanced with skyscrappers, cars, and planes. New technology has swept across the world. But those two monsters both the Gaurdian and the Enemy are out there somewhere. Japan, Aokigahara Forest A group of 3 explorers head into the forest. One tall Caucasian male with a 5 'o' clock shadow named Phillip and an equally tall Latino man with a gotie named Munoz. There was also a Japanese woman with long hair although she not much shorter than the other two men she appeared shorter in comparison. Her name was Makatato. She pointed West as the two men followed her . They eventually came across an old dirt path with some small stones aligned in it. Some stones are missing others a cracked or have developed moss. The men follow the path cutting through the thick grass and going around the trees that have grown on the path since. They then come across an open area where they are shocked see many gargantuan prints in the ground. They continue to explore the area coming upon a huge structure. \"What is it?\" Philip asked. Makatato Japanese to which Munoz replied for her. \"It's an ancient temple. Over centuries old.\" \"Okay, well I guess this will be the first time anyone been inside in centuries.\" Philip said. They went inside the temple and were suprised to see to was actually hollow inside. They were even more shocked to see a large area of the floor was covered in hardened mud. The only inhabitants of the tunnel had 8 legs and were too small to notice. \"What's this? It seems this ground has been tampered with.\" Philip asked. Once again Makatato began speaking Japanese as Munoz translated. \"Legend has it beneath this area lies the Gaurdian. A giant who was created by the gods to save us all from an evil force. Deep beneath us into the furthest l;ayers of the Earth he is believed to still be locked in battle with that evil.\" \"Thank you mam. We will pay you handsomely for your services.\" Philip stated with a grin. About 2 weeks later an entire construction site was set up at the temple as the dug around the area. A month later and dozens of feet into the ground nothing was found and the funds for the tunneling were cut. The crew left and the hole was never filled. Meanwhile far below in the hole a massive amount of Earth crumbled of the walls freeing Nitaishite. The giant frog jumped out of the hole. He proceeded to croak which echoed through the forest. In the city of Nagoya the people go about there business. Then all of a sudden the ground begins quaking almost in rhythm. *Boom*...*Boom*...*Boom* and then all of a sudden people see a huge beast standing in the distance. All of a sudden it hops into the air and lands right in the middle of the road. Right on top of a car actually. The giant frog once again croaks. Many cars speeding down the road try to break but the majority crash at the foot of the beast. The giant frog hops on top of a building bringing it down as it lands and does the same to two more buildings. The police arrive shocked at what is in front of them. \"What the hell is that?\" one police man named Carl asks. \"How should I know?\" his co-officer replies. They open fire on the monster but to little effect. The monster raises its webbed hand and smacks away a police car as it tumbles down the road a crowd of people watching begin to run. \"This isn't working!\" a man behind a police car door says. The frog steps on the police car instantly squishing it and the officer. The other police men back up in horror, but then begin opening fire again while maintaining a distance. Eventually army forces come and find the frog has completely destroyed most Police Force and open fire as well. \"It's about time someone got here I'm out of ammo!\" Carl said approaching a soldier. The soldier throw's him an automatic gun. \"That's what I'm talking about.\" Carl says as he begins shooting Even rocket launchers and high caliber machine guns have barely any effect. But they get the frogs attention as the frog hops onto a building behind it but ever so gracefully as it lands it hops back behind the building. The building crumbles forward as the armed forces run. But some unfortunately are caught under the building. Once the smoke clears the frog is gone. \"The hell was that.\" a soldier asks. \"Like my now dead co-officer said. How should I know?\" Carl replied. Meanwhile still in Nagoya the footage plays on the news on a house hold television. This is the house of Makatato. She watches the footage of the army shooting at the monster. She puts her hand over her mouth in awe. \"Oh my god. It's happened.\" she says in horror. Meanwhile at the local police station the cops were getting a bunch of phone calls from people who were effected by the event. Injuries, home destruction, and others were just calling because they were scarred. But then after hanging up for the fifteenth time. The man answering all the calls(the police cheif) Carl is met by a woman barging into the office. \"Who are you?\" Carl asked. \"My name is Makatato. I think I know what's going on here.\" the lady said. The phone began ringing once more. Carl couldn't take it anymore he ripped the phone on his desk off the wire and threw it at the the ringing kept going only for him to find out it was another phone on his wall. \"Please, take a seat. I need to take this.\" Carl said. Makatato sat in a chair while Carl spoke on the phone. In only a few short minutes he finished. \"I'm sorry. These people are just so shocked. They think I'm not. But who wouldn't be at a time like this. There is a giant frog on the loose!\" Carl exclaimed. \"Nitaishite.\" Makatato replied. \"What?\" Carl inquiried. \"The frogs name is Nitaishite. There is a temple in the Aokigahara Forest . It was the prison of two powerful monsters. Nitaishite the frog monster or The Enemy. As well as Gamera, the turtle beast or The Gaurdian.\" Makatato stated. \"The Enemy and The Gaurdian. How do you know this?\" Carl asked. \"I'm an adventurer and a professional tour guide. As well as History Teacher. I know much of Japans myths and past.\" Makatato replied. \"So are you saying this Gamera...is supposed to fight this frog monster and gaurd us?\" Carl asked. \"Yes, sir.\" Makatato replied. \"If both were trapped in the same place. Why has only one awakened?\" Carl asked. \"I beleive since Gamera is a turtle and therefore reptilian. Being buried so deep underground were mind you heat levels increase caused him to fall into a deep state of shock. In short his body won't let him awaken because he's cold-blooded.\" Makatato said. \"Are you absolutely positive. I can't take any risks this is a serious matter.\" Carl said. \"Sir, at a time like this I'm serious as can be.\" And so the Cheif used his resources to gather a construction crew whilist the army did their absolute best to destroy the creature. But only succeeded in annoying it. Meanwhile the construction group worked their way down to the very bottom of the hole where on one side there was a huge whole. No one had to be a rocket scientist to tell it was where Nitaishite escaped from. So dozens of workers began digging and drilling every wall of the hole in hopes they would find Gamera. Back in Japan Nitaishite made it way to the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge. Several people ran as the jets missles failed to stop it. Almost like cutting butter the frog beast smash through the bridge killing all of the unfortunate souls who couldn't make it out in time. It quickly made it's way towards a city not to far from the bridge making great time with massive jumps. Finally the workers in the hole struck a black material they could not dig through. Their was a rumble and the wall cracked. All of the workers backed up as far as possible as a giant turtle like beast fell out of the wall. It was out cold. But Makatato and Carl had prepared for this. The people in the hole made their way out as a 5 trucks filled with water emptied their liquids into the hole. Gamera was quickly submerged. He did not wake right away. Infact the group was afraid they drowned him. But no he was very much alive. Out of the hole the gargantuan tortise flew. It landed ontop of a couple of trees smashing them under it's massive figure. No one dared go near the titan it closed it's eyes. It's chest extended as it breathed in the air. Then it roared. Makatato didn't know how but it knew Nitiashite was out there and just as it was made to do it would defend the world from the beast. Smoke began emitting from the holes where Gamera's legs resided in it's shell. The beast was propelled into the air slowly at first then in a shocking display of speed it flew hundreds of feet in the air creating an audible \"boom\" as it flew at sonic speeds. Japan's armed forces put all of their power into stopping this thing that was attacking them but as Nitaishite advanced on it became all the more clear nothing they did had any effect. Missles, rockets, and grenades exploded onto the skin of the titanic toad but alas it just continued it's rampage of destruction until... A loud screeching roar was heard. Almost too fast to see Gamera came in at full speed tackling it's enemy to the ground. The frogs throat expanded as it croaked and stood up to see Gamera standing in front of him. Gamera looked around. Even though he didn't recognize his surrounding in this modern world he did recognize destruction. Gamera could not let this stand. The frog beast opened it's mouth as if it was trying to attach it's toungue to Gamera but then it remembered...Gamera ripped it off dozens of years ago. In a flash Gamera jumped onto Nitaishite and slashed relentlessly at it's face. Dark orangish fluid leeked from it's wounds. It used it's powerful legs to catapult Gamera into the air and then jumped after Gamera. The Guardian retaliated almost immediatley and retracted into it's shell. Nitaishite hit its head on Gamera's armor and fell to the ground. Gamera flew down unleashing a fury of fire balls from its mouth. The flames completely engulfed Nitaishite but Gamera did not let up he kept firing them off even after he had landed. Gamera waited infront of the area until the flames had died down. All that was left was Nitiashites scorched body. Gamera walked away triumphant. But, Nitaishite got up opening it mouth as wide as possible it swallowed Gamera's head. Slowly it began swallowing the entire turtle it had came up to Gamera's should when \"BOOM\"! A fireball went off in it's head blowing it up and killing the frog once and for all. This time Gamera was absolutely sure it was dead and let out a victorious roar flying off into the sunset. The End.

Not at all. BRING IT ON! 1964 was a revolutionary year. There was a musical revolution in England, a civil rights revolution in America, and a revolution-turned-war in Southeast Asia. In Japan, the kaiju revolution hit full stride. Mothra vs. Godzilla had just been released and Ghidrah the Three-Headed Monster was on the way. After ten years of Toho dominating the kaiju field, suddenly every studio wanted a kaiju. And for us kaiju, we were thrilled that, after years of struggle, we were finally gaining acceptance. It was that August that the following full-page ad appeared in Variety Japan: Are you the NEXT GODZILLA? Daiei Films is looking for a powerful, charismatic kaiju to star in his own series. Open call on August 25, at Daiei Studios. (Must be good with children) My roommate Barugon and I salivated when we saw that. After years of busting our tails, this was our chance at the big time. We prepared for our auditions with monologues from Henrik Ibsen and Arthur Miller, and practicing our city destruction on Erector Sets. We went to the countryside to practice my flame breath and his freezing breath. August 25 came, and practically every kaiju in the country was there for the audition. I mean, every kaiju. Most of them would at least appear on \"Ultraman\" or \"Space Giants\" or \"Giant Robo\". But some old-timers like Anguiras and Varan were there, hoping to revitalize their careers, and they were surrounded by younger kaiju who were seeking career advice. To audition, we had to get on stage and show our stuff in front of the casting directors and the rest of the hopefuls. Ebirah gave a good read, but his lack of special powers hurt him. Red King did an excellent Falstaff, but stumbled badly in the improv part when he tripped over a bridge. Manda and Kumonga were good, but we all realized that spiders and snakes wouldn't go over well with the children. Anguiras was a front-runner going in, but clearly had problems working with children. Gorosaurus, Gabara, Guilala, Gappa, Gyaos, Guiron, all of them put in their best effort. Afterward, we waited half an hour while the Daiei execs narrowed down their choices. I struck up a conversation with Gyaos. My bat-like new friend was talking about the time he sneaked into Yojimbo by pretending to be a bird, thus making him an unpaid background performer (a.k.a. an extra, for you non-industry types). I was about to tell him about my night on the town with Akihiko Hirata when a ruckus arose. Seems that Barugon had just met Baragon, and the two had gotten into an argument over the similarity between their names. It would have gotten ugly had I not stepped in and held Barugon back. He had given a good audition, and as much as I wanted the part, I would have been really happy if he had made the cut. I didn't want to see him lose out because of some stupid argument. The Daiei people came out and announced their five finalists. They were Barugon, Gappa, Varan, Baltan... and me! Me! I couldn't begin to tell you how happy I was. The five of us were to return in one week to finally determine who would make the grade. Barugon and I went home, our heads swimming. We both wanted it equally bad. We were on the verge of stardom by the skin of our fangs, possibly the next Godzilla or Mothra. Later that night, while watching TV and after a couple Sapporos, Barugon told me he had a plan.\"I probably shouldn't tell you this, Gammy, but I think I've got this locked up.\" \"How so?\" \"See, I've been working on something special. Now, all the great monsters have some kind of super power, right? You know, Godzilla's breath, Rodan's wind....\" \"Of course. We've got weapons like that ourselves.\" \"Well, I figured, why stop at one? Double the super powers, double the chances of getting the part.\" I understood his train of thought, but silently wondered if this might be overkill. \"Besides, it's gonna be geared for a younger audience. Which means kids, right? So, I figured, use something that the kids can relate to. Now, watch this!\" With that, Barugon grimaced, and slowly a rainbow grew out of the spines on his back. Really impressive, and totally original. But this was a high-energy rainbow, and it burned a hole through our roof which the landlord would be none too happy about. But that was far from our minds at that moment. Barugon was brimming with confidence that the big time was his. And I couldn't help but feel envious, seeing my chance at the part slipping away. As much as I wanted him to succeed, I wanted the part even more now. And the final call was only a week away. What could I do? The gossip columnists were all abuzz about who would be Daiei's kaiju star. The good money was on Varan, who had previous starring experience even though his film was a disappointment and he could do little more than be a gigantic Rocky the Flying Squirrel. After him was the unknown Gappa, who had a wife and son and could thus relate to the family audience. Baltan was a real talent, but was considered too insect-like to be a kiddie hero. That left Barugon, a puppy-like lizard with freezing breath and a killer rainbow, and myself, a fire-breathing turtle. Luck was with us when we arrived for the audition. When we got there, Gappa was sitting outside with his family, moping. He had apparently been doing well until a tall building had fallen on his head and knocked him silly. Barugon went in first, and came out beaming ten minutes later. \"Good luck, Gammy, you're gonna need it,\" he said slyly. \"They loved the rainbow, and I just plain kicked tail!\" \"Thanks, Bar. Good for you,\" I responded, shaking his paw. \"May the best monster win.\" At that time, Varan came in. He looked seriously intense, perhaps too much so for the casting directors. I felt better about that, but I still had to get over that rainbow. They called me in. I read my cold lines with the casting director, good. I trampled the city and set it ablaze, great. Then, I pulled my trump card. I had only just found out I could do it two days earlier. I pulled my arms, legs and head into my shell, and shot fire out of the holes. I lifted up from the ground, started spinning, and gained momentum. Soon I was careening all over the audition hall. I was still new at this, but I managed to not crash through the wall or into the casting people. After a minute, I slowed down, stopped, popped my head out, and took a bow, trying not to appear too dizzy. The studio people sat there in stunned silence for a moment. Then one man with a nice suit and singed hair stood up and exclaimed, \"Incredible! Amazing!\" This was Mr. Masaichi Nagata, the executive producer. \"We'll definitely call you!\" The announcement was made the next day. I was to be Daiei's Godzilla. Barugon was shocked. \"How did you do it?\" he asked. \"I thought about what you said about doing something for kids. I thought about what kids like, and I came upon flying saucers. So bascially, I became one.\" \"Ah, I see. Well, congrats, Gammy.\" He embraced me. Outwardly, he seemed glad for me, but I could see the disappointment in his eyes and hear it in his voice. This was the beginning of the end of our long friendship. Chapter 6: Behind the Camera \"I want to direct.\" Many an actor has said this. But this was the first time it came from the mouth of a kaiju. Mr. Nagata sat there, stunned and amused.\"I appreciate your gumption, Gamera. But you've only been in one movie.\" \"I know, but I learned a lot from that experience. I closely watched Noriaki Yuasa at work and got some advice from him. Besides, I did to that well-received kaiju production of 'Waiting For Godot' with Anguirus and Varan two years ago.\" \"Come on, Father, give him a chance,\" said Hidemasa Nagata, the executive's son and official producer of my next movie. \"I think he knows what he's doing. Besides, he did bring us a lot of yen with his movie, why not reward him?\" \"Very well,\" agreed Nagata, Sr. \"Tell me what you have in mind.\" What I wanted was a shift away from the kiddie-orientation of my first film. Something more mature. Inspired by the themes of Erich Von Stroheim's \"Greed\" and Ishiro Honda's \"Godzilla Vs. Mothra\", I wanted a story of greed and treachery entwined with the monstrous destruction. The Nagatas agreed to this. I also wanted a larger budget. After some consideration, they went with this as well. My only real roadblock was the concept of me, a kaiju, directing a movie. Things were still tough for my kind back then, despite the growing acceptance of kaiju among the humans, and the idea of a kaiju directing a major motion picture would create controversy that Daiei wasn't ready for. I agreed to go under the synonym \"Shigeo Tanaka\", a common nickname for filmmakers who wanted to remain anonymous (known to you Americans as \"Alan Smithee\"). Also, I wanted Barugon to star. The Nagatas weren't so enthused by this. They wanted me to come back. We compromised -- I'd be in the film, but I'd do most of my work behind the scenes and let Barugon have more screen time. Barugon was floored by the news.\"I can't thank you enough, Gammy! I'll show everyone what I'm really made of!\" Unfortunately, the problems started on the first day of production for War of the Monsters. Barugon immediately started acting like a prima donna, constantly demanding meals and massages, constantly complaining about the hot lights and shooting schedule, frequently yelling at the make-up girl and the caterers. The assistant director threatened to quit after two weeks, but I convinced him to stay on. We had a scene where Barugon knocked over a tower with his tongue. The tower fell the wrong way and landed on his head. Barugon cursed up a storm and assaulted a technician. We were able to separate the two, but barely escaped a lawsuit by the techie, and Daiei was able to keep the press from learning about the incident. Then there was the time when the leading lady, Kyoko Enami, slipped and fell on the frozen Osaka set. Barugon started guffawing loudly, and poor, humiliated, Kyoko burst into tears and ran from the set. It was time to put my foot down.I went to his trailer during lunch. I caught him shmoozing with a cute starlet and a bottle of sake. I chased the girl out and sat him down.\"I hate to tell you this, Bar, but you're being a real pain in the tail. I put my shell on the line to get you in this movie, and all you do is complain, yell some insults, and complain some more. The execs aren't happy, the cast isn't happy, and the crew isn't happy.\" \"But you're thrilled, right, Gammy?\" he said, smiling. \"No I'm not! I'm the least happy about it! They put a whole lot of trust in me, and you're bringing me down!\" \"Sorry, Gammy. Just trying to be a big star, just like you.\" That stung. I'll admit to being demanding at times, but I was hardly a tyrant. I could see Barugon's jealousy seeping through, but I couldn't understand why he had to lash out like that.\"Look, Bar, you're the star in this one. I have far less screen time than you.\" \"Yeah, but it's still your movie. You're the director, for crying out loud.\" \"And as the director, and as your friend, I'm asking you. Please, be cool.\"Barugon was on better behavior for the rest of the shoot. While he still wasn't the nicest one on the set, he at least stopped being angry and rude. War of the Monsters was released in April, 1966, and it was the most critically acclaimed of my early films. As I predicted, the reviewers liked the more mature tone and the greed subplot. Unfortunately, it wasn't as financially successful as Daikaiju Gamera, and the younger crowd stayed away. For the next movie, the Nagatas decided to bring back the child actors. Barugon and I weren't as close as we used to be. He moved out and found his own house. But we remained friends, for the next few months. Things finally came to a head at Infant Island. Production had finished on Big Duel in the South Seas a.k.a. Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster and Mothra was holding the wrap party. Mothra was always a classy lady and a gracious hostess, and her parties are still legendary in the Japanese film industry. Despite the fact that we didn't work for Toho, we were still invited, and I picked up Barugon and flew to Mothra's pad. This was one of the rare occasions (at the time) where humans and kaiju mingled at a social function. Varan was dancing to Yoshio Tsuchiya's flamenco guitar. Kumi Mizuno brought her beau, Nick Adams, who had trouble speaking Japanese but still regaled us with his stories about cruising Hollywood with James Dean and Dennis Hopper. Ghidorah's left and middle drank heavily, while the right, being the designated flyer, abstained. Akihiko Hirata spent most of the time in a corner by himself. Finally, the man himself, Godzilla, arrived. He came with his pals Rodan and Anguirus -- the three of them were known to the media as the G-Pack. I was introduced to my hero by Mothra's attendants, the Shobijin. We shook hands, he smiled politely, said he saw my movie, and started mingling with his friends. I was disappointed, but I knew that I really wasn't up to his level yet. All this time, Barugon had been heavily sucking on the sake, and he started getting obnoxious. He grabbed a couple torches and started spinning, yelling, \"Wheeeee! Look at me, I'm Gamera! Big fat movie star and friend of all children!\" I went to him to try to talk him down, but he turned on me.\"Go away, Mr. Big Shot! I don't need you! You screwed me out of that audition! It should be me! Me!\" \"Bar, please calm down. Have some coffee --\"\"NO!\" He grabbed a nearby copy of Tokyo Variety. \"Did you see this?\" I looked at the front page. In the lower left corner was a story about War of the Monsters being released in America as Gamera vs. Barugon.\"You see?\" he yelled at me. \"Even when you're not the star, you're the star! That movie should be called Barugon vs. Gamera! I'm the damn star!\" He turned away and started to leave. I grabbed his shoulder to try to talk to him. He wheeled around, opened his mouth, and shot his tongue right into my eye. I was stunned, and he took off. I'd never been so hurt in my life. I looked around the room. Godzilla saw me, sniffed rather disdainfully, and resumed talking to Rodan. I grabbed a nearby Asagi beer. And another. And another... I woke up the next morning in one of Mothra's guest rooms. I had a Shobijin on either side of me. I wish I could tell you more about that, because I know it would sell more copies of this book, but I really can't. I was too drunk to remember anything. I got up and shakily flew home. When I got back, I turned on the TV and heard the sad news. Barugon had been found washed up on Tokyo Bay, nearly dead. The silly fool had tried swimming home from Infant Island, and his reaction to water had nearly killed him. I went to the hospital to try to see him, but they wouldn't let me into his room. He had apparently left instructions to keep me away. The night before would be the last time I'd see him for nearly 30 years. Barugon's book, Hollywood Barugon, depicted me as a tyrant on the set and a user and abuser off the set. I'll never understand why he had to talk about me like this. I hate to sound cold-blooded (even though I am, in the literal sense), but Barugon has nobody to blame for his downfall but himself. Chapter 9: Destroy All Monsters -- Except Me I got a call from my agent, Ichiro \"Swifty\" Misawa. \"Gammy? Baby! Great news, pal. I got a shot for you at what you've always wanted.\" \"A date with Mie Hama?\" \"No! Work in a Toho movie! A big one, too! They're calling it Destroy All Monsters and they're gonna have everyone! Godzilla, Rodan, Angilas, Ghidorah, Mothra -- you name him, he's in. Except for Baragon. He got into a motorcycle accident last night, and he was supposed to have a meaty part. That's where you come in.\" \"That's great!\" Swifty was right. It was what I'd always wanted -- to work alongside Godzilla and with the master filmmakers at Toho. Sure, it would only be a supporting role, compared to my starring roles at Daiei, but you know what to do when opportunity knocks. \"So when do we start?\" \"Not just yet, Gammy. We gotta talk to the Toho people first. We gotta meeting with them at Toho tomorrow at two. They're still not sure if they want to use you yet, so let me do the talking, and stay cool.\" For all my success, I still got chills the first time I set foot on the Toho property. This truly was the big time. We drove by the giant pool where all those ocean scenes were shot, and by the soundstages where most of the action was filmed. I could swear I saw Toshiro Mifune walking by, but I couldn't be sure. We came to the giant meeting room in the executive office. There they were -- producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, director Ishiro Honda, special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, and the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. We shook hands and made our introductions, but only Godzilla seemed unfriendly, sensing his only competition at the box . Tanaka spoke first. \"Mr. Gamera, as I'm sure you know by now, one of our stars, Baragon, will be physically unable to appear in our next kaiju feature, Destroy All Monsters. We may still be able to fit him in, but only in a cameo appearance. That leaves a major role up for grabs. Now, we've considered a number of monsters to take Baragon's place. Inevitably, your name came up. But the question remains -- why you, and not someone from our own Toho family?\" \"It's simple, Mr. Tanaka -- who else is there?\" Misawa responded. \"Varan can hardly move anymore. The Gargantuas are too scary, and I've heard they stink up the set. Guilala and Gappa can't get out of their studio contracts. Magma? Who's gonna buy a rampaging walrus? Don't even make me mention Dagora!\" Tanaka was more than a little nonplussed -- putting Magma in Gorath had been his idea, and everyone really did laugh at the idea of a giant walrus.\"Mr. Misawa,\" said Honda, \"here's the problem. Gamera is a big star, but would he benefit from taking a smaller role?\" \"I think that --\" I began, but Misawa cut me off. \"You bet he would, Mr. Honda. \"Gamera's earned his stripes, and he deserves this shot.\" \"Perhaps,\" said Tsuburaya, \"but here's the problem. Gamera is known around the world as the friend of all children. The role we have for him in Destroy All Monsters involves him destroying Paris, and he is supposed to be relegated to an island where he couldn't destroy cities. Would the moviegoers buy him as a 'bad guy' and possible threat to mankind?\" \"Now, in Destroy All Monsters, do the monsters attack because they're under alien control? That's what I've heard.\" \"Yes. That is the case.\" \"Well, there you go! That's just what Gammy does in his upcoming movie, Gamera vs. Viras. He's the hero again, but, if I may give some of the plot away, the aliens grab hold of his mind and he's back to his old bad self.\" \"I heard that that's going to be stock footage from your first movie,\" Godzilla muttered. \"Hell, that wasn't even in color. Let's see what he can do now.\" \"And that's why we're here -- to work with the masters,\" Swifty said, effectively buttering them up. \"Well, there is the matter of continuity,\" Honda said. \"And since when has continuity ever mattered? You've killed half your monsters, only to bring them back. Gammy's still alive, just stick him on the island. A kaiju's still a kaiju, and there's still the potential for accidentally stepping on some old lady's house. If you've got Mothra on Ogasawara, why not Gamera?\" The Toho people, except for Godzilla, were pretty much sold.\"Very well, then,\" said Tanaka. \"I do have a contract drawn up already.\" He presented a sheet of paper, the contract. \"The undersigned shall have a major role in Destroy All Monsters, destroying Paris, acting as a major threat, and helping to defeat King Ghidorah in the dramatic finale.\" Tanaka handed me the pen. I reached for it, ready to embark on a whole new career at Toho. That's when the door flew open. In strode Jinsei Kobashi, Misawa's former protege and partner. They had an ugly falling out when Swifty bilked Kobashi out of a percentage of their profits, and Kobashi had it in for his old friend. He was followed by, of all kaiju, Gorosaurus. \"Tanaka-san!\" Kobashi interrupted. \"Please listen. This is a Toho movie, so it should have Toho stars, and not an upstart from Daiei. But have you considered Gorosaurus? He proved his worth in King Kong Escapes, didn't he?\" Misawa lost his cool. \"Gorosaurus?! You have got to be kidding me! He's no kaiju, he's just a dinosaur! Look at him! No wings, no spikes, no weapons, what's he gonna do, dropkick Ghidorah to death?\" \"That's a great idea!\" said Godzilla. He turned to Tanaka. \"Think about it, Yuko\" -- only Tanaka's closest friends could call him that -- \"the final battle is six against one as it is. As tough as Ghid is, it's obvious he's not going to win. Now, take out Gamera and put Goro in his place. Having to fight a weaker monster who has no real special powers gives Ghid a better chance, right? Besides, we do want to keep it in the Toho family, don't we?\" \"He's right,\" Tsuburaya said. \"Also, the part we had for Baragon has him burrowing through the earth. It's been shown that Gamera's a flyer, not a digger. Gorosaurus is an unknown commodity, so the public will have an easier time believing it.\" \"Yeah, sure, lots of carnosaurs have been found under the ground,\" snarled Misawa. \"But guess what? They were all 70 million-year-old skeletons!\" \"My mother was a carnosaur!\" growled Godzilla. \"There's nothing wrong with us. Besides, with all due respect for your client, a jet-powered turtle is rather, dare I say, goofy.\" I got the feeling that he meant that with no due respect at all. \"Goofy? You wanna talk about goofy? Let's talk about how you and your kid looked in Son of Godzilla!\" Godzilla was about to destroy my agent, but was held back by Honda and Tanaka, while I had to restrain Misawa. \"Mr. Misawa!\" snapped Tanaka. \"Your insolence will get you nowhere.\" More politely, he turned to me. \"Gamera-san. You really would bring a lot to Destroy All Monsters, but I've decided that Gorosaurus-san will fit into our film much better.\" \"Did I mention that Goro will work for next to nothing?\" added Kobashi. \"Gamera-san, I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I encourage you to keep up the good work, as I enjoy good, healthy competition. Someday, perhaps, there will be a place for you here at Toho. But not today.\" We left the studio angry -- Swifty at the Toho people, me at Swifty.\"I'm sorry, Gammy. It was a long shot, and Godzilla has a lot of pull. He pretty much only wants to work with his friends, you know.\" \"Yeah, but you weren't a lot of help, blowing up in there like that. I'm surprised you didn't get us thrown out with that Magma remark.\" Misawa wasn't quite done yet. In a small measure of revenge, he managed to persuade Daiei to change the title of Gamera vs. Viras to Destroy All Planets, deliberately aping the upcoming Toho film. Not that there were any planets destroyed in my movie, but then there wasn't much destroying of monsters in Destroy All Monsters either. Except for King Ghidorah getting his tails kicked. Which I could've been a part of. Thanks, Swifty! Chapter 12: The Tale of the Tokyo Ten The Tokyo Times headline on Decenber 31, 1969, sent shockwaves around the Japanese film industry: Human Actor: \"I am Godzilla\" Actor Haruo Nakajima, 42, revealed in an exclusive interview that he has played Godzilla and other monsters in many of Toho's kaiju , best known for bit parts in \"The Seven Samurai\" and \"Destroy All Monsters\", admitted that, while wearing 100-kg costumes surrounded by special-effects explosions could be difficult and dangerous, \"it pays really well.\" Nakajima added that there were other human actors who played monsters. Toho Studios officials refused to comment. Nakajima was written off as a fraud at first. Godzilla came out the next day and said he did all his own scenes and stunts. Rodan, Angilas, Ghidorah, Mothra, and I all said the same thing. Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Eiji Tsuburaya, Noriaki Yuasa, and Hidemasa Nagata, among other filmmakers, denied any knowledge of what came to be known in the media as \"Suities.\" But the speculation continued, and soon the Parliament got involved. Specifically, one senator in particular, the previously little-known Jozu Mikirati, who said that the use of Suities went \"against everything good and pure about Japan,\" and demanded a federal investigation. Somehow, he got it, and Mikirati became a demagogue as a result. Many kaiju and human actors and filmmakers were called in. Nakajima was the first. He retracted his statement about playing Godzilla, but insisted that he had played Varan in \"Daikaiju Varan\", Gaila in \"War of the Gargantuas\" and Gezora in \"Yog, Monster from Space\". Godzilla was next. He told his story again -- nobody played him but him, and that he had no knowledge of any men in suits. The rest of the G-Gang -- Rodan, Angilas, Mothra, and Ghidorah -- all said the same. Eiji Tsuburaya was scheduled to testify next. He was one of the most respected men in the film industry, second only to Akira Kurosawa himself, and his testimony could have ended the hearings right then and there. Sadly, he had been ill for some time, and he died the day he was supposed to come in. The Parliament was good enough to withhold hearings for one week out of respect. When the hearings resumed, it was my turn. I remember entering the Diet Building hounded by reporters. As I was telling the media that I had no knowledge of any Suities, I remember a little boy coming up to me and saying, \"Say it ain't so, Gamera. Say it ain't so!\" Inside, I gave my sworn testimony. I gave full medical and biological information, confirming that I was indeed 100 percent kaiju. Senator Mikirati, ever the menacing skeptic, repeatedly asked me if I had any human relatives, or if I dated human females. No, I had no human relatives, but I did have my romantic flings with women. More to the point, Mikirati asked if I suspected that Barugon, Gyaos, or any of my other kaiju costars were men in rubber costumes. I honestly told him that I had no such suspicions. Things were low key until Baragon came in. Before his motorcycle accident, he was one of the industry's most respected and popular kaiju. He was known as \"The Monster of a Thousand Faces\" for his various roles on Tsuburaya's \"Ultraman\" and \"Ultra Q\" shows. Since then, he became a notorious alcoholic, and he was practically embalmed when he testified. What was worse, he felt that he had been jerked around by Toho, and blamed the filmmakers and his fellow kaiju for his lack of work, so he entered the building as an angry, drunk kaiju. In his testimony, with his guard down, he admitted a shocking fact: He had once entered a restroom and found a man crawling into Varan's back. When asked to identify the man, Baragon said that it was, in fact, Nakajima. That blew the roof off. \"Have you now, or have you ever been, a Suitie?\" became a battle cry in the Diet, in the media, and on the street everywhere you went. Varan was called in. He broke down in tears on the stand, and admitted that he had been played by several men. Several! One by one, they were ratted out. Ebirah had been a man with scuba gear. Sanda and Gaila were people, too. So were Gezora and Kameba from Toho's recent \"Yog, Monster From Space\", although Ganime was 100% kaiju. Guilala was fired by Shokichu Studios, once he revealed his dirty little secret. People had long wondered why Bemlar's arms couldn't work on the very first episode of \"Ultraman\"; now they knew the truth. Dagora couldn't even claim to be a man in a suit -- even worse, he had just been a special effect operated by wires, totally unobserved by Tsuburaya's failing vision. The final kaiju to make his revelation was Zigra, my next co-star. He had been a longtime vocal coach in the kaiju community, having taught Minilla to speak in Godzilla's Revenge, and was highly respected for his rich baritone. Problem was, he was a fish, and couldn't perform the land battles, so he had hired a man to dress as him in certain scenes. There they were, the Tokyo Ten -- Varan, Ebirah, Sanda, Gaila, Gezora, Kameba, Guilala, Bemlar, Dagora, and Zigra. They had all, to some extent, been played by humans onscreen. Most of them wouldn't make so much as stock footage for the rest of their careers, and never got to be turned into Bandai figures. Varan became an acting coach, while the Gargantuas became a stand-up comedy duo. Kameba went into advertising, Dagora into coal mining, Gezora turned to real estate, and Bemlar found happiness as a Red Cross volunteer. Guilala disappeared altogether,presumably homeless. The only real casualty of these was Ebirah, who jumped into a giant pot of boiling water in 1976. Zigra made out the best of the Ten -- he continued to work as a vocal coach, but was no longer as respected as he once was. Still, the fact that he had only used a Suitie for certain scenes that he couldn't actually perform himself made him more forgiveable. Ironically, the actor who had played him for the land scenes went on to become an executive at Bandai, which is why the toy company produced a Zigra figure -- in the human, bipedal position! Nakajima and the other suit actors themselves were hardly considered villains in the first place. In fact, as time passed and wounds healed, they became respected for the hard work that they put into those heavy costumes, and have become popular guests at fan conventions. A bright spot came for all kaiju in 1974. Senator Jozu Mikirati had become even more obnoxious after his triumphs in the Parliament-Kaiju Hearings, and went on to try to weed out any and all suspected kaiju in the Prime Minister's cabinet. However, he could find no evidence, and became more belligerent as he became more desperate for victims. He had been a longtime drinker, and became more intoxicated as time went on, as well. He lost reelection, and suffered a fatal heart attack, but not after he had ruined so many lives. As for the traitorous Baragon, he eventually sobered up and continuted to work, but never apologized for his remarks and never reclaimed his past success. However, he has retained a loyal cult following to this day. Last year, he received a lifetime achievement statuette at the Eiji Awards, but received a mixed reaction from the audience. (Personally, I applauded, but wouldn't give him a standing ovation. Megumi Odaka and Koichi Kawakita, among the younger generation, did stand up for him, while the old G-Gang sat with their arms crossed.) This marked the end of the Golden Age of Kaiju. Moviegoers could no longer trust us, and they started staying away in droves, and production on kaiju films was drastically cut. The movies that were being made grew increasingly immature and uninspired. Many of the longtime kaiju stars like Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah were only sporadically working, while human actors like Kumi Mizuno and Akira Takarada went on to work in more conventional movies with all-human casts. I don't think I need to go into my last movie of this time, \"Gamera Vs. Zigra\". I don't particularly want to, either. The movie had incredibly negative press about Zigra's body double. On top of that, it really was a lousy movie. The scene where I played my theme song on Zigra's back was embarrassing for everybody involved, and the little girl who played Helen was the most unprofessional brat I've ever worked with, asking for a Coke after every take. My brief fling with the movie's villainess, the beautiful Eiko Yanami, was the only redeeming value I found in the whole experience. Daiei Studios, already on the verge of bankruptcy, had no choice but to cut me and cease production on all kaiju films. As cheap as my movies had become, they were still the most expensive productions at Daiei. I was no longer a box office attraction, not even with the children, and I had to be let go. The day after I had received my walking papers, and the news had hit the media, I trudged by a construction site. A couple bigoted workers saw me and laughed. \"Ha ha ha! Who you gonna beat up now, Super Turtle? Huh? You'll never eat this town for lunch again!\" I outwardly ignored them, but inside, they hurt me to the bone. What would I do now? Chapter 14: My Life in Puroresu Super Monster Gamera. A mostly stock-footage pastiche of scenes from all my previous movies in a last-ditch attempt to keep Daiei from bankruptcy. It didn't work. I really have nothing to say about it, other than I needed the money. It did result in one development, however: The leading lady in the few new scenes was Mach Fumiake, a female professional wrestler. She told me that if I ever needed work, or wanted to try something different, that I should try puroresu, or professional wrestling. She gave me the business cardof Binzu Makamahon, the president of the Japanese Wrestling Federation. I told her I wasn't interested, but I thanked her and kept the card just in case. After the release of Super Monster Gamera, however, I didn't have much of a choice. I was paid scale (no pun intended), and only got a few measly yen from the returns. I wasn't getting any work. I had to move into a substandard apartment, and still had tons of bills and debts to pay off. On top of that, I got a letter from Karen, the karate student from New York with whom I had that affair. It turns out that she gave birth to quadruplets -- my children! -- whom she named Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, and now she was demanding child support! After a year of desperation, I gave Mr. Makamahon a call. Now, I had watched puroresu a few times as a little kaiju. It had been a huge sport in Japan for many years, and the late Rikidozan, the founding father of puroresu, is still every bit the icon in Japan as Godzilla. While I liked it as a lad, I felt that I had outgrown it, that staged fighting should be saved for movies instead of being passed off as a \"sport.\" But then, considering how many children's films I had done, I thought that becoming a wrestler myself would be a lateral move at worst. I met with Makamahon the following spring. He was quite interested in working with me. I certainly had stage fighting experience, and my celebrity status would certainly result in many ticket sales.\"Gamera-san, I think you would fit in perfectly here in the Japanese Wrestling Federation. Yes, some people might not be comfortable with the thought of a kaiju as a professional athlete, but then that's what they said about kaiju as movie stars only a quarter-century ago. We'll find a way to work you into our sport soon. I don't think it would quite work to have you start out small, fighting jobbers. You're a star, you still are, and we should get you into main events right away.\" He then handed me two tickets to next month's big card. \"You'll be sitting in the front row, son. From there, you'll be introduced to the exciting world of puroresu!\" \"Sounds great,\" I said. \"You'll let me know what you'll do to 'introduce' me, right?\" \"Uh, yeah, sure. Just come to the show and we'll let you know how it goes from there.\" His hesitant answer did puzzle me, but I soon forgot about it. I went to the show with my neighbor, Keiji. I asked the ringside officials if Mr. Makamahon was available, but they said that he was busy getting ready for the card and wouldn't be able to see me until afterward. I asked them to tell me what would happen to bring me into wrestling. They just said, \"You'll know when it happens.\" The ring announcer introduced me to the audience; I waved and got polite applause. No big cheers except from some of the younger crowd; I was still box-office poison, and people still had trouble trusting kaiju after the Suitie Scandal a decade ago. I must say that, even though I hadn't seen wrestling in two decades, I was quite impressed. The grapplers would jump around and throw each other around for twenty minutes or more. Many times, their moves looked like they really hurt them. One wrestler, patterning himself after the TV and comic character Tiger Mask, was an incredible athlete, doing all sorts of dropkicks and backflips. These guys would make great actors, I thought to myself. My personal introduction to wrestling came after a tag team match. I forget who the Japanese team was, but the ugly Americans were the biggest bad guys in the JWF. One of them was a big, burly cowboy with sandy-brown hair, with a bullrope in his hand and a chaw of tobacco drooling from his mouth. His name was Stan Hansen. His partner, Bruiser Brody, was a truly frightening individual -- six-and-a-half feet tall or more, with long black bushy hair, matching beard, and a maniacal look in his eyes. He was swinging a heavy chain and inexplicably chanting, \"Ush! Ush! Ush!\" Brody and Hansen destroyed their opponents in less than five minutes, one of their hapless victims being taken out on a stretcher. Then they turned their attention to me.\"Hey, Turtle Soup!\" Brody yelled into a microphone. \"You think you're tough? Try us on for size!\" \"Gamera!\" Hansen joined in. \"You suck, your movies suck, your kids suck, and your fights sucked! Let's see how you do against us.\" They climbed out of the ring and confronted me at ringside. I knew that this was it, that I'd be taking on these guys. Just play along, I thought to myself. They got in my face, started to yell at me, and then Hansen slapped me, surprisingly hard. I acted naturally and struck back. I found myself being ganged up on by Brody and Hansen and dragged into the ring. I tried my best to fight them off, but Brody choked me with his chain while Hansen hogtied my hands and feet, preventing me from going into my shell for safety. They then brought a couple of steel folding chairs, ready to pummel me like no kaiju ever had. Then a cheer went up from the crowd, and a strong-chinned Japanese man entered the ring. It was Antonio Inoki, the most popular wrestler in Japan, the same man who defeated no less than Muhammad Ali in a boxer-versus-wrestler match. While Brody and Hansen were much larger than Inoki, the hero fought both men off with a series of karate chops and kicks. The bad guys retreated to the locker room, and Inoki untied me and helped me to the back. A doctor was examining me when Makamahon walked up. \"Great job, Gamera-san! Welcome to puroresu! How are you feeling?\" \"Well, a little hurt, actually. Those guys hit me pretty hard.\" \"That's Stan and Bruiser for you. They're not so mean away from the ring, but they can get a little crazy. But don't worry. Antonio here will have you ready for the big match. Three months from now, in Budokan Hall. A check for twenty million yen for you after the match.\" For the next three months, I spent six days a week in the gym training with Inoki. He ran me ragged, going through calisthenics, weight training, aerobics, running five miles a day and up and down countless flights of stairs. Then he showed me how to give and take wrestling moves -- bodyslams, suplexes, takedowns, armlocks, leglocks, and submission holds, along with how to deliver kicks, punches, and clotheslines. A month before the match, I had noticed that we hadn't seen our opponents since that fateful night.\"Antonio, when are we going to rehearse the match with Brody and Hansen?\" \"Rehearse? Ah, that's a common misconception, Gamera-san. Our matches are improvised.\" \"I see.\" I had no problem with that, as every actor must know a thing or two about improvisation. \"How or when will I know what they'll try to do to me?\" \"Don't worry. After a while, you can see what's coming a mile away. Watch Hansen and Brody on TV, so you can get used to their style.\"I told him that I experienced their style firsthand at the arena. What I didn't tell Inoki was that I was starting to think that this might not go the way I thought I would. Meanwhile, Makamahon was heavily promoting my in-ring debut, and my opponents were having fun talking about what they'd do to me on TV. \"Gamera!\" Hansen bellowed. \"I used to see you turtles all over the place down in Texas, and I'd splatter their guts all over the highway with my pickup! That's just what we're gonna do to you, ain't that right, Bruiser?\" \"Ya know what? Me and Stan went out on a monster hunt last week. First we tore Rodan's wings off and turned them into origami. Then we grabbed Ghidorah and tied his necks into knots. And we actually like those guys! You don't wanna know what we'll do to you, Turtle Soup! Ush! Ush! Ush!\" The big event finally came. A sold out crowd was on hand at Budokan to see me and Inoki try to drive out the foreign menace. After an exciting undercard, it was time for the main event. Brody and Hansen entered the ring first, although they threatened to enter the seating area to attack the fans. Inoki and I came out next, to thunderous applause. After the prerequisite ring introductions, the match was on! Brody and Hansen charged at us, but Inoki and I were ready. Brody was kicking at my shell-covered stomach, not doing any damage. I then feinted some punches at Brody, like any movie stuntman would, expecting Brody to go along with it. He looked at me, amused. He growled, \"You're new at this, aren't you?\" and kicked me square in the mouth with a size-14 boot. That hurt! Wait a minute! That wasn't supposed to happen! I started swinging back, and we drove the bad guys out of the ring. From there, it settled into a more conventional tag team match. We countered their brawling with a more \"scientific\" style. At one point, I caught Brody in a hold called an airplane spin, where I picked him up over my shoulders and spun him around. Had I turned on my jets I could've sent him way into the bleachers. Brody bounced back and started punching me on my head. His fists were heavily taped, and I could feel something hard and sharp digging into my skin, opening up a nasty cut on my head. My God, I thought, he's got razor blades taped in his hands! The end of the match came when I slammed Hansen and delivered a belly flop onto him from the top turnbuckle. I covered him for the pin, but Brody attacked me for the save. We then started trading punches. By this time, I was really hurt and quite angry. This wasn't a put-on, this was a real fight! Brody kicked me in the face with a boot that knocked my left tusk out. In my fury, I threw my hardest punch at him. At that moment, something strange happened. Somehow, a bony spike --maybe some piece of bone that had become unlodged during the match, maybe some part of my genetic development -- poked out of my elbow. Brody wheeled back from my fist, but got grazed by my elbow spike, opening a huge gash across his forehead. With all four of us fighting in the ring at the same time, the referee had no choice but to throw out the match, ruling it a double-disqualification. Hansen knocked Inoki out of the ring and brought in two chairs for him and Brody to use on me. Discretion took the better part of valor, and I retreated into my my shell. They pounded on my armored back with chairs, feet and fists for a minute. Then I had a golden opportunity. I saw Hansen's feet in front of me, so I popped out, grabbed him by the ankles, tripped him up, and started pummelling him. I was punching, choking, and biting Hansen into oblivion as Brody stomped on my head and shell in futility. At that point, a horde of wrestlers, officials, and security poured out from the back and tried to separate us. After about ten minutes, they finally did, and we were led to our separate dressing rooms. I was checked by a doctor, who gave me a few stitches to sew up my cut. My tusk would have to be replaced. I angrily glared at Inoki, who seemed apologetic for the whole incident. \"I thought Binzu would've told you how it would be,\" he said. \"You're the biggest wrestler in Japan, why couldn't you tell me?\" \"We don't like to tell outsiders what we do. We could face serious problems if certain people found out how we work. Insurance companies are reluctant enough as it is to deal with us.\" Binzu Makamahon walked in with a big smile on his face. \"Great job, Gamera-san! You looked great in there! And when those spikes came out of your elbows -- ouch!\" This only got me angrier. \"What the hell was that! Those maniacs tried to kill me! I thought this was supposed to be faked!\" \"Sure. And you're supposed to be a guy in a rubber costume. Look, I took a lot of heat from this -- most guys don't want to wrestle with kaiju, they don't know if you're gonna breathe fire on them or something. Tell you what, I'll give you your check -- I threw in a little extra -- and we'll forget the whole thing. No hard feelings?\" \"Plenty of hard feelings.\" I grabbed the check and left the arena. On my way out, I passed my opponents. \"Great job, Turtle Soup!\" Brody said with a friendly smile. \"You'da made a great rassler!\" I said nothing and left. To this day, I refuse to watch wrestling. I have all the respect in the world for wrestlers and what they do, but I can't forget my experience in this field. I know enough about it that Antonio Inoki was eventually elected to the Parliament, and that Stan Hansen is still brawling nearly 20 years later. Bruiser Brody wasn't so fortunate -- he was stabbed to death by another wrestler in Puerto Rico in 1988. A terrible way to go, even for a maniac like him. At least I was out of my financial crisis. I made all my payments, got my creditors off my shell, and was able to move on. Things were looking up for me until a week later, when I picked up the paper and read the news:Godzilla had just resigned with Toho for a seven-picture deal. I spent a lot of my check on sake that night. Chapter 16: The Big Comeback I had just completed my hundredth performance as Jean Valjean in the musical production of Les Miserables. I returned to my dressing room and found two envelopes waiting for me. One was from the producers of an American television show called Mystery Science Theater 3000, where they had shown some of my movies and made wisecracks through it. They wanted me to appear at their convention in Minneapolis that September. I had seen tapes of the show, and while I had trouble understanding some of their jokes, I was rather amused and I was thinking of accepting their invitation. It's not very often that I get to travel to America, after second, larger package contained a movie script: GAMERATHE GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE This should be fun, I mused. Was Daiei desperate for cash again? More kids? Cheap sets? Corny songs? Gymnastics? Generally embarrassing myself like I used to? Turns out I was hooked from page one. This had everything I could ever have hoped for -- an intelligent and serious plot, good dialogue, threatening monsters, thrilling action. And very few children, and only in bit parts at that.I was so absorbed in the script that I hadn't noticed that a half-hour had passed, or that I was still in my Valjean costume. I came to when I heard a knock at my door. There was a well-dressed man in his mid-thirties who said, \"Ah, Gamera! What do you think?\" I couldn't believe it. It had been over twenty years since I last saw him, but the features were familiar, and the twinkle in his eyes was still there.\"Kenny?\" Indeed it was. Yoshiro \"Kenny\" Uchida, who had been my costar in my first feature film, had left acting, grown up, married, had kids, and had gone on to become a successful agent. I quickly figured out how that script had found its way into my dressing room. We went out to dinner, caught up on old times, and talked about this new project.\"So Yoshiro, why a new Gamera movie? Why bring me back?\" \"Easy to say why, Gamera. Godzilla's big business all over again, and it's time to recapture the magic. It's starting to look like 1964 again, and everybody again wants a kaiju. Hollywood wants Godzilla. Gappa, Guilala, even Yonggary are all talking about comebacks. It's time for you to come back too, Gammy. The stage isn't good enough for you, and you know it. I told Daiei that we could not only bring you back, but give you a total makeover.\" \"That's easy for you to say, but what about the public? What sort of makeover? They still see me playing with kids on cheap sets and making a fool of myself.\" \"That's why we have to reinvent you. Daiei wants to make something darker than what you're used to, and they want to spend more than a little money on it. We've got these great young guys to direct and do the special effects, and they have a vision, Gamera. The only thing we still don't have is you. Are you with us?\" I was drawn in by his words, and I had no reason to distrust Yoshiro, but I'd been through a lot over the years, and I wanted to be careful.\"Well, it sounds great, but I at least want to meet with these people first. I've been promised a lot of good things before.\" \"Gamera, trust me, this is gonna be good. Our movie together was the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and I have you to thank. I owe you big time.\" I returned with Yoshiro to Daiei Studios two days later. I met the producer, Tsutomu Tsuchikawa, the director, Shusuke Kaneko, and the special effects director, Shinji Higuchi. I can only say that I was incredibly impressed with these young men. They wanted to do a serious kaiju eiga, a movie the likes of which hadn't been done before. They had ambition and respect for this project, and definitely wanted to steer me toward more mature themes. I still had one question for them: \"What if I say no?\" Kaneko: \"Then we'll go ahead with a new Majin movie.\" Rockhead? I was sold. I wouldn't be going to America after all. I had just arrived on the set on the first day of filming, when I heard a familiar voice behind me.\"Good to see you again, Gammy.\" I turned around to see a vicious-looking, bat-like kaiju. The features had aged well, more streamlined and meaner looking, but I'd recognize that flat, pointed head anywhere. \"Gyaos! How the hell are you?\" We had a lot of catching up to do, and did so as we headed over to craft services for breakfast. Gyaos had lived a rather interesting life. \"About twenty years ago, I realized I was, in fact, female. I eventually married Viras and we had a child, Irys. We've been a happy family ever since, even though the work's been dry lately. Until now, that is.\" \"That's great. Frankly, I always thought there was something, well, funny about you. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The description in the script of my opponent did sound familiar, and I was hoping it would be you.\" \"Yes. It's another way of bringing back the series, they say. I have to tell you, it's great to be back.\" There was a spirited air on the set that I had never experienced before. Everyone seemed to by motivated by ambition rather than money. The sets and miniatures I worked on were the best I've ever seen. Not only was I reunited with Norio Hongo from my original movies, but I also had the pleasure of working with Akira Kubo, my first film with a veteran Toho player. And of course, there were the ladies. Mayumi Naganime, who had the lead female human role, was a beautiful and talented lady. We had dinner, but that was it, since she was already seeing somebody. The other major female player, Ayako Fujitani, was the daughter of an obscure American martial arts actor named Steven Seagal. Not yet the best actress (I imagine what acting ability she has comes from her mother's side), and a little too young for me, but the teenager might improve in time. I'd had a good feeling about this movie from day one, and my hopes were fulfilled at the premiere. That night turned out to be the greatest night of my life. After years of being \"the friend of all children\" and \"a Godzilla wanna-be\", I had at last achieved legitimacy. Gamera, the Guardian of the Universe was a big hit with both the critics and the public. The movie was said by some to be the best since the original \"Gojira\", and Kaneko and Higuchi were called the next Honda and Tsuburaya. I was voted \"Comeback of the Year\" by Tokyo Variety, and some compared it to the revival John Travolta was experiencing in the States. Despite all that high praise, there were two things that night that made the premiere really special. I was talking with my old director, Noriaki Yuasa, when I heard a familiar voice behind me. \"Glad to see you again, Gammy.\" I turned around. It was Barugon. I hadn't seen him since Mothra's party twenty-nine years ago. He looked rather haggard, but it seemed that the old animosity was gone. We embraced, much to the delight of everyone around. Turns out that Daiei had planned a reunion with my old co-stars that night, and they were all there -- Gyaos, Viras, Guiron, Jiger, and even old Zigra. We stood together for photos, and the press had a field day with it. My other memorable moment came at the post-premiere party. I was mingling at the party when the King himself came up to me. \"Ah, Gamera,\" Godzilla said. \"Excellent movie.\" That was all he said, but I noted the look in his eyes. Previously, there had been condescension, but now I saw respect, and maybe, just maybe, even a slight hint of jealousy. I was back, baby! This story was featured in G-Fan magazine. I got it from the site \"shrine of gamera\". I thought kaiju fans would like to read it! ","Summary":" First up, this ain't my story. Not at all. BRING IT ON! 1964 was a revolutionary year.

The skies were darkened by their obsidian wings with their sharpened fangs colored deep from the blood of their victims shining in what little rays of light that dared to shine into such a flock of devils. He was wounded, terribly wounded, and He could not gain the necessary time to strengthen Himself, to enhance his powers to the next level. Was it all fruitless after all? Would He fail another civilization and merely watch as their ashes blew to the four winds and remain dormant until the time came once again? He had been born a protector of civilization, it was His duty and His destiny since He came into existence. He would give everything He could to protect mankind and those that could carry its torch. Though man was unaware, their greatest strength resided not in their ability to adapt to any given situation but to strive forward against anything that stood in their path. This eagerness, this desire to overcome was strongest in man's children for children were, and are, belittled for their naivety, their innocence in life though it is these traits that make them far stronger than their elders. He could kill man if it was necessary. What was but a mere handful of lives compared to countless more? Why save five when one could save a million? He killed, excessively one would say, but He could not deny the desire to protect the children of man. He had wounded Himself on purpose many a time, taking wounds that could kill Him if they struck proper to save the children. Why? Because man's strength lies greatest in man's children. And He knew this. That was why His mark, His symbol could strengthen His power through the connection of a child, or those close to still being called as such. He needed their strength, their resolve to enhance His own until He didn't need it anymore. He was and is the phoenix of legends past, dying and reincarnating in a grander form than the previous, leaving the bones of His past buried in the tears of the Earth. It took many of His lives and one ultimately powerful loss for His body to gain the strength needed to call the life's blood. The Mana. The Lifestream. The life's blood of the very Earth itself, that which kept it alive and safe from the Earth's own children. And He drank from it, took large gulpfulls of it. Why? Because, it was necessary. The Intruder could not be beaten by even His power and He was forced to play a final hand against Her. So He called forth the life's blood and drank from it, absorbing its power and releasing it in a single blast that ended His twelth life much sooner the He had expected. He had died. Again. But He was stronger. Then, the Failure emerged, It that dared to call itself a guardian, a protector of man and its children when It merely desired nothing more than to consume them. The Fallen were at least kind enough to kill their victims swiftly, with mercy, but It… It kept them alive as long as It could so that It could drink from their fear, their terror of facing death and its messenger. It had even managed to gain an ally, a child filled with hatred for Him, matching It in Its rage spawned from dark jealousy. The child loved It and saw It as the polar opposite of Him, covering truth with fiction until It did what It had done to the Father. It betrayed her. And He… He saved her and did what the Mother could not. He killed It. At the cost of His arm. And now He was marching forward, past the infernos that were created from His battle with It, the useless stump of His arm still bleeding heavily onto the ground, staining it neon green. The gaping hole in His torso was still exposed and one could see through it quite easily. He was in pain and His body cried for the release of Death and the renewal of Life, but He could not pause. He had to fight. It was what He was, a guardian of man and of the Earth. He was the embodiment of life and death, of reincarnation and reclaimation. A protector of innocence and a destroyer of sin and He would do all that He could to guard that which He stood for even at the cost of His life. Though the fires raging around Him and the harsh roars of the oncoming flock of Fallen Ones were steady in their large volume, He could hear a final word from His chosen, His ally of yesterdays' past. It was a word of prayer, of self-assurance, of hope, and, in the end of all things, of victory. Gamera.

It had been many years since any of the giant monsters that plagued the planet Earth had been seen. There were many theories on the subject. The one that seemed to hold the most weight was that due to changes in the environment, especially since there has been no atomic testing for many years that this was the reason for the end of the giants. Or so the self satisfied world would like to believe. November 26, 2012; North fork Island The small science station of North Fork Island was not too impressive. A long rang telescope to scan the night skies was the largest building on the island. Henry Sakada the chief scientist was scanning the darkened sky. It was his shift and he was really in his element, for the stars was his dream. He had finished photographing the section of stars for the night when there was a sudden flash in deep space. Sakada had to look twice before he realized what he was seeing. He punched the intercom button \"Hey you guys!\" he shouted \"Get up here; we got something on the scope.\" The crew came running as Sakada transferred the images to the large plasma screen. What they saw shocked them. It was a huge circular object with fire coming from the four corners of the object. Nishimura, the young intern was puzzled; \"That's not a flying saucer?\" Ota, the group's cook glared at the boy. \"What else could it be? It is saucer shaped and its flying, so what else could it be?\" Sakada finished transmitting the images to Kure, and very quickly got a reply. \"Kure Institute say…\" he stopped talking. Everyone looked at their chief. \"What is it, Boss?\" Ota asked. Sakada replied \"They say that it's Gamera.\" Tokyo Defense Agency: \"Gamera?\" The army chief of staff asked. \"Yes sir. They believe it is Gamera that was seen entering the Earth's atmosphere at 2300 hours.\" The person doing the talking was Miki Atsumi, director of defense studies. \"We believe that Gamera will return to Japan.\" The chief of staff was not pleased by this information. \"What should be our response if this creature lands in Japan? Miki did not hesitate \"As Gamera has shown to be a friend of mankind; it is our opinion that any military response should be held back. In the past Gamera has appeared when there have been dangers to us.\" Miki paused \"It is possible because of the appearance of Gamera, that there may be a greater danger either present or about to become present.\" The chief of staff looked down on Miki for a moment, and then smiled. \"My dear young woman.\" He told her \"You are indeed your father's daughter. When he had a belief he took it by the teeth and ran with it.\" Miki grinned \"He certainly does.\" \"The thing with your dad is he has a good instinct about things.\" Chief of staff said. \"And he had a knack of being right, I believe that your right too.\" Looking at the screens in the command center. He asked the question \"So what should we be worried about?\" Turning back to Miki; \"The Gyaos? Rodan? Maybe even Godzilla?\" Miki replied. \"It has been many years since Godzilla has appeared anywhere, Rodan even longer. But the Gyaos are Gamera's natural enemies. They could be stirring in the depths again.\" \"You are not making me happy with these tales.\" Chief of staff said. Miki shrugged \"Dad always said the hardest part was the waiting.\" He was right. In a small village in Kyushu, a small farmer's cattle were protesting an unwelcome intrusion loudly. The farmer rolled out of his bed with a curse and stepped outside. He was horrified to see several huge bat-like creatures feasting on several of his cows. He stood petrified, as he saw this grisly sight. Had he got to cover he would have lived to tell the story. However the farmer reached in the shed for a shotgun and fired. This got the attention of the creatures. Several seconds later the creatures were feasting on the farmer. Then they took to the night skies, for the Gyaos had truly returned, and death would follow them. As is well known in the 21st century. There was no such thing as a secret. By morning the entire nation was aware of appearance of Gamera. the news media was blaring to the world the return of the giant monsters. It was a smaller note of the murdered farmer in Kyushu. The media and military would have done well to have paid more attention to this event. For there was something far larger was stirring in the depths of the earth, larger even then the Gyaos, about to burst through and bring death and destruction to Japan and the world. Miki Atsumi was dozing in her chair in the ops center. like many of her team she had not left the center since Gamera reappeared. Slowly she smelled coffee under her nose. She opened her eyes and looked up. There was her father, Saburu Atsumi, former General of the self-defense forces with a cup of coffee in his hand. \"Are you ever going to bed?\" he asked Miki smiled and gratefully took the cup. \"Thanks Dad.\" she said as she started to sip the hot liquid. \"What brings you down here?' \"I heard what was going on.\" Saburu said. \"Thought I'd see if you needed some help. Miki looked to the screens. \"The station on North Fork island spotted Gamera at 2300 hours. After that we had a report of a farmer being slaughtered by what was described as some bat-winged creatures.\" Saburu thought \"Could be the Gyaos, you think?' \"That's what we though at first, Gamera and the Gyaos are blood enemies.\" Miki said. \"but..\" Saburu looked to his daughter \"But what?' Miki looked at the screen. \"There's something about that part of Kyushu that seems to be ringing a distant bell.\" Saburu looked at the digital map of kyushu. \"I don't know..\" Then it occured to him. \"Can you bring up a record of monster sightings?\" \"Otami.\" Miki calls to her assistant. \"Bring up the files, anything and everything in Kyushu. Time frame between now and 1945.\" The data began to file over the screen. Father and daughter went through the data, when a very interesting piece of information popped up. \"The old coal mines where Rodan first appeared are only 60 nautical miles from where the farmer was killed.\" Saburu said. \"Rodan.\" Miki said softly. \"This is getting to be a nightmare.\" \"It already is.\" Saburu said. 300 miles to the south, Gamera made landfall. The great beast sat down on the beach near the city of Kobe. He raised his great head and let out a mighty roar to tell every living creature that indeed he had returned. This was a challenge that did not take long for a response. For in the skies over the city several bat-like creatures started circling the massive turtle. Gamera looked skyward, the bloodlust in his eyes at the sight of his old enemies, the Gyaos. He let out a mighty roar and prepared to challenge his enemies, when from the skies came another even louder roar came out of the blue.

The internet was down last month, so... yeah... We're still not entirely sure whether it's back on, like really. But, it's working at the moment. So, here's a story for y'all. It's about Thumbelina and her sister, Genevieve. :3 Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 1: Two Small Girls Once there was an old woman who longed for a child. A good witch visited here and gave her a little barley corn. She told the woman to plant it. So, the old woman went home to do just that. She watered it and nurtured it until a flower bud bloomed. \"Oh! What a pretty flower.\" She exclaimed. She gently kissed the bud, causing it to open up. Inside of the flower were two girls about the size of the woman's thumb. One had orange hair and was wearing a light teal skirt, a white top and light teal slippers, while the other had brown hair, styled slightly different than the first, and was wearing a purple top and slippers with a midnight blue skirt and sleeves. They both climbed onto the woman's hand. \"Hello, Mother.\" The orange-haired one said. The brunette smiled and waved at the woman while holding her thumb for balance. The woman smiled at them, then looked toward the girl with orange hair. \"I'll call you Thumbelina,\" then, turning towards the other girl with brown hair, \"and, I'll call you Genevieve.\" … \"Hey, Lina!\" Thumbelina turned around from sweeping with a leaf to see her twin fixing and bending something. She went over to Genevieve. \"What's that?\" she asked. Genevieve tied the last string on and held up her invention. \"You know how Mother uses that big broom with those bristles on it?\" Thumbelina nodded. \"Well, I made some for us! See, they're our size.\" She smiled, handing her sister one of the miniature brooms. Thumbelina smiled and hugged her sister. \"Thank you, Genny. Now, let's finish cleaning up.\" As they swept, Genevieve glanced off into the distance. She wondered what the rest of the world was like… if there were others her size. I wonder what it's like out there… she thought to herself. Maybe I'll see what it's like out there one day… Later that evening, Mother was reading a story to her daughters. While she read, Thumbelina couldn't help but interrupt. \"Oh, Mother. Are there any stories about little people? Like me and Genny?\" Genevieve nodded her agreement. \"Well, as a matter of fact, girls, there are. Here, have a look.\" She said, pointing to a page with a picture of two fairies getting married. \"You see, here, their having a wedding.\" Genevieve gasped when she saw their wings. \"Mother, what are those?\" she asked, pointing to them. \"Why, those are wings, Genevieve. All fairies have them.\" Mother answered. \"Have you ever seen a fairy?\" Thumbelina asked. Mother thought for a moment. \"Well, I thought I did once.\" She said. Genevieve smiled at the picture. \"So, I guess it works best if two people are about the same size?\" \"Well, yes.\" Mother told her. Genevieve looked over at her sister and they both sighed sadly. \"Well, what's the matter, girls?\" Mother asked them. \"Genevieve and I are the only ones our size. Maybe if we were big…\" Thumbelina started to say. Mother interrupted her. \"No, Thumbelina. No. Don't wish to be anything but what you are.\" She looked at her daughters for a moment, and then held her hand out for them to climb onto. \"Come along, girls. It's time for bed.\" … Thumbelina and Genevieve's beds were made from nutshells with small pieces of fabric for the bedding and blankets. As the girls settled in to sleep, the family's dog, Hero, climbed into his bed. \"Good night, girls.\" Mother said, starting to leave. Genevieve called to her mother. \"Oh, Mother? Could you leave the book open?\" she asked. Thumbelina added, \"We want to look at the pictures while we go to sleep.\" Mother placed the book near their beds so they could see it. \"Thank you.\" Thumbelina said. Once their mother left and Hero fell asleep, Genevieve and Thumbelina climbed out of their beds and over to the book. Thumbelina looked at the picture of the fairy prince and sighed. \"Wouldn't it be wonderful? If there really were fairies?\" she asked Genny, twirling around at the thought. Genevieve smiled. \"It would be nice… I'd love to meet a fairy prince.\" I've decided not to use some of the songs since the story will change a bit from the movie. You'll see how.[Chapter 2] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 2: Love at First Song Outside the small house, a parade of fairies went about, changing the leaves for the upcoming autumn. Each fairy sprinkled magic dust on the leaves they pasted; making sure each one got its share. In the middle of the fairies were the Queen and King, who were doing their part, as well. The Queen, Tabitha, looked around for her son and nephew, but couldn't find them. Her husband, Colbert, noticed her sigh with worry and frustration. \"What's the matter, my queen?\" He asked. Tabitha shook her head. \"Cornelius and Christopher have flown off somewhere again. When will they learn?\" \"Honey, they're 16. Let them have a little fun.\" \"'A little fun?' Colbert, the duties of being a prince must come first to them. There will always be time for fun.\" Tabitha sat back in her seat and sighed again. Meanwhile, two fairy princes, one with yellow wings and red hair, the other with blue wings and black hair, were flying around on Prince Cornelius' bumblebee, Buzzby. The other prince, Prince Christopher, sat behind his cousin, facing away from the direction they were flying, and sighed, looking up at the sky. Cornelius rolled his eyes. \"What's wrong, Chris? I thought you liked flying with Buzzby!\" he said to his distraught cousin. Christopher shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't know. I've just been thinking about... what will happen if Aunt Tabitha wants us to get married soon.\" Cornelius groaned at the thought. \"She'll probably make us have a ball, dance with every princess there. Ugh.\" he groaned again. \"Haven't you ever thought about what qualities you want in a wife?\" Cornelius thought for a moment. \"Well, I think-\" He was cut off by the sounds of singing and laughter, coming from a nearby window. Christopher heard it, too. \"Let's go see, Cor.\" Chris suggested. They flew to the window and saw two girls, about the size of fairies, but with no wings, singing and dancing about on the table where their nutshell beds were. \"Wow...\" Christopher whispered as Genevieve twirled around in the moonlight coming in through the window. She looked like a goddess, an angel, illuminated in the light. Her beauty was only enhanced by how graceful she was on her feet. Though she was far from a skilled dancer, she still looked amazing. Cornelius, however, was entranced by Thumbelina's singing. Her voice was sweet and perfectly pitched. He sighed softly and listened to the two girls talk. Thumbelina sighed, looking back at the picture in the book. \"I hope fairies really do exist. I'd love to go flying.\" \"Me, too.\" Genevieve agreed, sitting down by the window sill. Cornelius decided that his cousin and he should introduce themselves. He saw that the window was opened slightly and motioned for Christopher to follow him inside. Once inside, they both flew down onto the middle of the table. \"Ahem. Excuse me, ladies.\" he said, getting their attention. Thumbelina and Genevieve both gasped in fright. Thumbelina ran to hide inside of a nearby teapot, while Genevieve ran the other way and hid behind the storybook. Christopher flew over to where Genevieve ran. \"Oh, don't be afraid. I'm sorry we scared you. You see, my cousin is very bad at introductions.\" He stated, earning a glare from Cornelius. Christopher stuck his tongue out at him, then turned back to Genevieve. \"Won't you come out, so we can try it again?\" he asked, holding his hand out to her. Genevieve took in the features of Christopher's face. His hair was combed upward and held in place with some sort of gel. He had a slightly pointed nose and a kind smile. The thing that intrigued Genevieve most was Christopher's eyes. They were light blue and sparkled. Cornelius had apologized to Thumbelina and convinced her to come out at about that time. They all met up back at the center of the table. It was then that Genevieve and Thumbelina noticed the two princes' wings. \"Oh! You two have wings!\" Genevieve gasped. Thumbelina looked back at the book, then to her sister. \"They're fairies!\" she said happily. Just then, Hero had woken up. He saw the two fairies and immediately went into 'protect and attack' mode. Both princes wielded their swords and stood protectively in front of the girls. Thumbelina moved between Hero and Cornelius. \"N-no, Hero! They're friendly.\" she said, trying to calm the dog down. Genevieve joined in. \"Yes, Hero, they are, see? U-uh, Hello. My name is Genevieve. How do you do, good sirs?\" \"T-Thank you for coming to visit us.\" Thumbelina silently motioned with her hand for them to play along. \"O-Oh, yes! The pleasure is ours.\" Cornelius said, Christopher and himself bowing. Once Hero saw this, he sighed and went back to all smiled at one another, amused and happy that Hero understood. Christopher looked at Genevieve. \"Your name is Genevieve? It's lovely.\" he said, causing Genevieve to duck her head in embarrassment. \"T-thank you.\" she said, blushing. \"What's you name?\" \"Christopher.\" He answered. Cornelius smiled at Thumbelina. \"What's your name?\" he asked. Thumbelina smiled back at him. \"Thumbelina... what's your name?\" she asked him. \"I'm Cornelius.\" \"Cornelius? *giggle* Well, that a funny name. Oh! I-I mean, it's perfect.\" she quickly said. \"So... tell us about the Fairy Court. Is there a prince?\" \"Actually, there are two.\" Cornelius said. \"They must be extremely handsome.\" Genevieve sighed. \"Oh, they are.\" Christopher said, feeling smug. \"We'd love it if we could meet them.\" \"We'll tell them.\" Cornelius said, inching closer to Thumbelina. Christopher did the same with Genevieve. \"Oh, thank you.\" the girls said. Just then, Buzzby started buzzing, feeling forgotten out in the window sill. \"What was that?\" Genevieve gasped. Christopher said, \"Oh, it's just Buzzby. Cornelius' bumblebee.\" \"Oh, I left him outside. Hey, you wanna meet him?\" he asked the girls. Thumbelina nodded, but Genevieve politely shook her head. \"I think I wanna stay here… and, maybe talk with you, Christopher?\" she asked him shyly. Christopher nodded to her, and then turned to Cornelius. \"Don't forget to come back and get me.\" He said. Once Thumbelina and Cornelius left, Genevieve sat down by the window sill, the light of the moon shining against her face. Christopher sighed at how well she fit with the moonlight. \"So, Christopher, are there many different types of fairies?\" Genevieve asked, bringing Christopher back to reality. \"W-well, yes, there are. For instance, I'm a Moon Fairy. I like the moon and night-time. It's much for peaceful than during the day.\" He said, sitting next to her. Genevieve blushed slightly and looked over at him as he continued. \"I also like things that go well with the moon… like you.\" He said. \"Me? How do I go with the moon?\" \"* Moonlight becomes you… It goes with your hair… You certainly know the right thing… to wear. Moonlight becomes you… I'm thrilled at the sight… I could get so romantic… tonight.\" As Christopher sang, he picked Genevieve up and danced with her, floating above the table. \" You're all dressed up to go dreaming… Now, don't tell me I'm wrong… And, what a night to go dreaming… Mind if I tag along?\" Genevieve, entranced by the song and the feeling, shook her head, smiling. The couple danced in the air, twirling and dipping. \" If I say 'I love you', I want you to know… It's not just because there's moonlight, although… Moonlight becomes you so…\" Christopher whistled for a few bars, spinning Genevieve around. \" Moonlight becomes you…\" He dipped her, and then brought her back up, close to him. \" What a beautiful view… Moonlight and you…\" Genevieve started singing to him. \" I'm all dressed up to go dreaming… I won't tell you you're wrong… Oh, what a night to go dreaming… Please, won't you tag along?\" They started singing together now. \" If I say 'I love you', I want you to know… It's not just because there's moonlight, although…\" \" Moonlight becomes you so…*\" Christopher finished the song, bringing them back to the table surface. Genevieve stared into his eyes, never wanting this moment to end. Even if Christopher was someone she'd only met a few moments ago, she felt as though they were meant to be together. Christopher felt the same way. Their lips inched closer and closer together. Just then, Thumbelina and Cornelius came back. Christopher and Genevieve pulled apart, the latter blushing slightly. Thumbelina waltzed inside and onto the table, a loving look in her eyes. \"We're back!\" she called. Cornelius followed her inside, when he heard a voice. It sounded like… his mother! \"Cornelius! Christopher!\" Cornelius hurried inside and motioned for everyone to get down and out of sight. \"What is it, Cor?\" Chris asked. \"Mother!\" he whispered to his cousin. \"What's wrong with your mother seeing us?\" Genevieve asked. Thumbelina added, \"And, who is she?\" \"The Fairy Queen. My mother.\" \"Well, Aunt Tabitha can be a bit rash with meeting new people.\" Christopher tried to explain. \"Cornelius!\" \"Christopher!\" Colbert joined in. \"Oh! We have to go. But, we'll come back tomorrow.\" Cornelius told Thumbelina. \"And, we'll introduce you to Aunt Tabitha and Uncle Colbert.\" Thumbelina stammered. \"Y-you two a-are the… tomorrow?\" \"Yes, we're the fairy princes,\" Christopher said. He turned toward Genevieve. \"We'll come back here tomorrow, we promise.\" He said, holding her hands in his. \"Then, you can meet our mother!\" She said happily. \"Great.\" Christopher smiled. \"Until tomorrow, then.\" \"And, then we'll live… happily ever after.\" Thumbelina said to Cornelius. He moved closer to her. \"Oh, much longer…\" \"Cornelius!\" \"Christopher!\" Both princes hurried over to Buzzby. Thumbelina and Genevieve followed them. \"Wait!\" both girls said simultaneously. Thumbelina removed the flower necklace she'd obtained on her flight with Cornelius. \"Do not forget me.\" She said softly. Cornelius gently touched the necklace, then removed his ring and put it on Thumbelina's finger. \"I'll never forget you.\" \"Never, never.\" Thumbelina sighed, hugging him. Genevieve took off a golden necklace she wore often and gave it to Christopher. \"To remember me by.\" She said shyly. Christopher smiled softly at the gesture, and then put his own ring on Genevieve. The ring had a shining moon stone in the middle, and smaller ones around it. \"I'll always remember you.\" The boys quickly jumped onto Buzzby's back and waved good-bye to the girls and they flew to catch up with the King and Queen. Both girls sighed happily and went back inside. \"Oh, Genny! I can't sleep, I just know it!\" Thumbelina told her twin. Genevieve wondered if she would be able to get any sleep, either. Thumbelina stood up and went over to Hero, who was half-awake. \"I'm going to tell Mother about Cornelius coming here tomorrow.\" \"Good idea. She'll want to know about any visitors.\" Genevieve yawned. \"You go ahead and tell her, I'm going to sleep.\" She told her sister, who smiled and tapped Hero on the paw. \"Hero, take me to Mother, please. I have something important to tell her.\" Hero yawned, nodded, and then let the small girl climb onto his head and walked to find her mother. … No sooner after they left, someone snuck into Thumbelina and Genevieve's room. The culprit was wearing a mask and dark clothes, to ensure no one saw them. They walked quickly and quietly over to the bed with a girl in it and snapped the shell shut. \"Gotcha!\" Genevieve gasped. She tried to open the shell, but it won't budge. \"Help! Someone! Hero, Thumbelina, HELP!\" she cried out, hoping they were still within ear-shot. To her happiness, she soon heard Hero's angry growls and Thumbelina's muffled voice, telling the intruder to stop. \"Bring her back! Stop!\" Thumbelina shouted, holding onto Hero's fur as he ran after the thief. \"Hurry, Hero.\" She begged. She wouldn't let them get away with her sister. The masked stranger hopped into the river to escape. Hero, trying desperately to follow, couldn't fit under the long log the river traveled under. He whimpered sorrowfully. Thumbelina sighed shakily. \"No…\" she felt like she was going to cry. Meanwhile, Genevieve was scared when she heard the splish-splash of river water. She couldn't swim very well. \"Hello?! Hello?!\" she shouted, hoping the thief would at the very least, acknowledge her. She sighed, and tried to sleep it off, hoping it was all a very bad dream.[Chapter 3] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 3: The Wrong Girl; The Journey Begins \"What do you mean, 'She's not the right one'?\" Mrs. Toad was confused by her son, Grundel. She had gone all the way to that house; been chased by that awful dog and shrill-voiced girl… and she had kidnapped the wrong one? \"Take her back. I want Thumbelina.\" The Spanish toad said gruffly. He looked over and saw his two brother, Gringo and Mozo, looking over the, what he thought of as, 'Thumbelina look-alike.' \"What's your name?\" Mozo asked, mostly looking at the shining rock on Genevieve's finger. \"What are your names?\" she countered, not trusting them enough to reveal such information. Mrs. Toad went over to the brunette and smiled. \"We are the Singers de Espagna. These are my sons. Gringo, Mozo, and Grund-\" \"You are not Thumbelina!\" He said angrily to Genevieve. \"Where is she?\" She shrank back from him a little, scared by his gravely voice. What does he want with Thumbelina? It probably isn't good. She thought cautiously. Genevieve stood up straight and decided to see what the toads wanted from her sister. \"Who wants to know? What do you want with her?\" \"I marry her! I love Thumbelina.\" He said proudly, as if the wedding was already planned. Genevieve gasped in horror. She knew her sister would be horrified if she had to marry a toad. She gathered up her bed and some nearby sticks and tree sap. She turned her little bed into a boat in just a few minutes. \"What do you think you're doing?\" Mrs. Toad asked, watching the girl climb into the makeshift boat. Even if she wasn't the one Grundel wanted, she could still use her in their show. \"Going home. I have someone missing me.\" She said, thinking of Thumbelina. She pushed the boat into the water and waved good-bye to the toads. Then, she shouted to Grundel. \"Oh, and about Thumbelina… She wouldn't've wanted to marry you, anyway! Just find a kind lady toad and marry her! Give up on Thumbelina!\" she said, meaning it more of a demand than a suggestion. She then turned her attention to steering the little home in the direction she hoped was home. … Back at the house, Cornelius and Christopher flew into the room and saw the place in shambles. Both boys gasped at the sight, then Cornelius went over to Hero, who was sitting down by the table and looking miserable. \"What happened?\" Hero acted out Mrs. Toad snatching Genevieve's bed and taking her down the river. Christopher shook his head in disbelief. \"She's been kidnapped? I have to find her!\" he declared, hurrying over to Buzzby. Cornelius grabbed his shoulder. \"Hold on, now. Where's Thumbelina?\" he asked. Hero shook his head and sighed sadly. He motioned with his fingers, someone walking, then he pointed out the window. \"She followed after them? On foot?!\" He was worried for Thumbelina. It was obvious that she hadn't many tracking skills. He let go of Chris's shoulder and walked with him over to Buzzby. \"We'll bring them back, Hero. You stay here with their mother.\" He said. Then, Buzzby took off flying fast into the sky. … \"Genevieve?!\" Thumbelina called for her sister. She looked around and only saw grass and very tall trees. Everything was big enough back home and on their farm; things out here were much bigger. \"Oh, Genny, where are you?\" she wondered miserably. Maybe I should ask someone for help. Thumbelina thought as she walked over to a bird, who was taking a rest after a long morning flight. \"Excuse me, sir?\" The bird looked at her and smiled. \"Bonjour! And, how are you this fine morning?\" the French sparrow asked politely in greeting. \"Well, I'm managing.\" Thumbelina sighed, still deeply concerned for her sister. \"What is the matter, Mademoiselle..?\" he hesitated, not knowing her name. \"Thumbelina.\" \"Thumbelina. Well, I am Jacquimo. But, what is wrong?\" Jacquimo asked. Thumbelina wiped her eyes and took a breath to steady herself. \"My sister was stolen away, and I'm not sure where to look for her. Could you help me, Jacquimo? Please?\" she asked kindly. Jacquimo clicked his tongue a few times in pity. The poor girl had just wandered into the middle of nowhere in search of her sister. He knew he'd do the same for someone he cared for. \"Of course, Thumbelina!\" he said, making Thumbelina smile and thank him. Then, he stretched out his wings and flattened them so Thumbelina could get on his back. \"We'll search for her together.\" … Genevieve had been floating along the river for a long time, and she didn't even know if she was headed the right way. She watched the bugs and creatures of the forest as she passed by them. When they waved or smiled or said 'hello', she was polite to them and did the same. She was still worried about the toads… and Thumbelina. Maybe she was back home, telling Cornelius and Christopher what had— Christopher! The princes! She'd completely forgotten. \"Oh, no! They must be worried sick about me! I gotta get home.\" Suddenly, the current sped up, causing Genevieve to lose her balance and fall back into the bed. She looked and saw a waterfall a few feet ahead of her little boat. She tried to get back up again, but the swaying and rocking of the boat kept knocking her over. As the waterfall got closer, she tried harder and harder to get back onto her feet. \"Help! Someone, please!\" she shouted, still attempting to stand upright. She closed her eyes as she felt the boat plunge forward. Just then, she felt something grasp her shoulders and fly her off somewhere. She slowly opened her eyes and saw a moth carrying her somewhere. She looked back down toward the waterfall to see her bed crashing down. She glanced back up at the moth. \"T-thank you. Who are you?\" she asked. The moth didn't speak. Rather, he made a series of clicks and hisses. Genevieve couldn't understand what he was saying, but decided she'd have to ask about it later. She felt so weak from panicking; she could feel herself drifting off to sleep. … As Jacquimo and Thumbelina flew through the sky, Jacquimo decided to try and make some conversation to lighten the mood. \"So, Thumbelina? What is your sister like?\" he asked. Thumbelina smiled. \"She's the nicest person you could ever meet. She's kind and caring. But, she can be a little skittish and frightful sometimes, especially around new people… except Prince Christopher. She took an instant liking to him. I think they're just meant to be together.\" As she spoke, Thumbelina continued to look around, hoping to see her sister somewhere. \"I hope she's okay…\" \"I'm certain she's fine. After all, she's your sister, isn't she?\" Jacquimo said, making Thumbelina feel a little better. \"Yeah…\" Jacquimo stumbled a bit. \"C-could we pause a moment? My wings, they're so sore.\" \"Of course, Jacquimo.\" Thumbelina said. They landed in a clear patch so Jacquimo could rest. … Meanwhile, Christopher and Cornelius were busy flying around, asking every person they passed whether they had seen either sister. Each time, they received a 'no.' Christopher decided to fly over to a boat nearby. \"Excuse me,\" he called, landing on the platform of the boat, \"but, I was hoping someone would be able to tell me where a young woman is.\" Just then, Mrs. Toad peeked through the curtains and gasped. She went back behind them, much to the prince's confusion. Her three sons looked at her and asked, \"Who's there?\" She smiled, hoping that Prince Christopher has there for a show. \"It's a prince! Get ready for the show, boys. We need the money.\" Mozo rolled his eyes. \"Mama, he said he's looking for a girl.\" \"No doubt the one Mama snatched.\" Gringo added, causing both toads to laugh. While the toads conversed, Cornelius flew down next to Christopher. \"C'mon, Chris. We've gotta look for Thumbelina and Genevieve.\" \"I wanted to ask whoever lived here, but, they seem to be preoccupied.\" He said, getting ready to leave. Just as they turned to leave, Mrs. Toad rushed out. \"Wait, wait! Won't you stay for a performance, your Highnesses?\" she asked. Cornelius politely shook his head. \"I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're in a hurry. Maybe you could help us, though.\" \"We're looking for two young women. One has orange hair, the other has brown hair.\" Christopher said. Mrs. Toad hummphed when she figured out who they were talking about. \"Oh, her. The one with brown hair went down the river. Her sister… I don't know.\" Christopher looked down toward where she said Genevieve went. \"How long ago?\" \"A long time ago. She probably half-way across the world by now.\" Mrs. Toad said. Cornelius shook his head. \"No, I'm sure she's all right. Come on, Chris. We need to find Thumbelina and Genevieve.\" With that, the two fairy princes flew off down the river. Grundel stumbled out from behind the curtain at the sound of Thumbelina's name. He only caught a glimpse of Cornelius flying away. He fumed with raged. \" I marry her! Thumbelina mine! \" Oh, dear...[Chapter 4] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 4: Bank the Moth; Berkley Beetle Genevieve awoke in a bed fashioned from leaves and twigs with mud holding it together. She looked around and saw that she was inside of a hollowed out tree stump. She got up and looked down at her midnight blue and purple dress to see it was ripped and tattered at the bottom. Her dress was also wrinkled from getting wet. \"Hello?\" she called out. The moth that had saved her earlier came into view. He was wearing a suit that had threads of gold sewn into it, making it shine slightly. She smiled slightly at him. \"Um… Thank you for saving me.\" She waited for his response, but received none. \"What wrong? Can't you talk?\" The moth shook his head. Genevieve gasped softly. \"I'm sorry… You must have so much to say. But, you can't…\" she said sympathetically. The suited moth looked out the window and saw a few snowflakes fall. Genevieve followed his gaze and gasped. \"Oh, no! Winter! How will I get home now?\" She felt tears fall down her cheek. Before, she'd wanted to explore the world and see what it had to offer. Now, she just wanted to be with her family and Christopher. She missed him so much. More than anything, she missed Thumbelina. Her sister, her best friend… she had no idea where she was. Whether she was at home or out searching for her. She hoped for the former. Genevieve sniffled and wiped the tears away, not wanting to cry anymore or think about her sorrows. She turned back towards the moth that had saved her and asked. \"What's your name? Could you write it down for me?\" she asked. Instead, the moth, once again, made a series of clicks with a few hisses. Genevieve tilted her head and tried to process what the moth had done. \"What?\" she asked after some time. \"His name is Bank.\" A voice behind her said, startling her. Genevieve turned around to see a white silkworm moth walking towards them. \"W-who are you?\" she asked. \"My name's Siloma. It's nice to meet you.\" Siloma said politely. She, then, turned toward Bank. \"Nice of you to bring someone home on such short notice. Winter's coming soon, and we barely have any food as it is.\" Genevieve looked out the window again. Then, she turned toward the two moths. \"Well, I think I would be able to help you gather food, if that's the problem. I could also help with anything around here.\" She motioned toward the room they were in. Siloma smiled at her. \"Well, thank you, Genevieve, but I wouldn't want you to get overworked.\" \"H-how do you know my name?\" Siloma chuckled. \"The princes are looking all over for you and your sister, dear. Prince Christopher seems most determined to find you.\" Genevieve couldn't fight the blush on her cheeks. Then, she remembered what Siloma had said. \"Wait, my sister? She's out there?!\" she started panicking. \"I've gotta find her!\" she said, starting for the door. Siloma grabbed her arm gently and brought her back to the bed. \"Hold on, now. There's no reason to rush into things. I know you're worried about your sister.\" She tried to sooth Genevieve. \"But, if you just rush out there, you'll be putting yourself in danger without a plan.\" \"But, I can't leave her out there on her own!\" Genevieve sobbed into Siloma's shoulder. Where was her sister now? … At that moment, a far distance away, Thumbelina was looking around in the patch that she and Jacquimo had landed in. Jacquimo had fallen asleep from fatigue, and Thumbelina didn't feel like disturbing him. Absentmindedly, she started humming a song. Nearby, a beetle heard her and immediately fell in love with her voice. He flew out toward her and laughed loudly. Thumbelina screamed in fright, never having seen a beetle with such an odd appearance. \"How ya doin', toots? Berkley Beetle's the name, razzamatazz is my game.\" He introduced himself. \"I'm not your toots. Where did you come from?\" \"Where? Up there!\" Berkley Beetle pointed upward. There was a hole in a high point of the tree that was lit up with music pouring out of it. Thumbelina looked up and smiled a little, hearing the lively music. \"What do you want from me, Mr. Beetle?\" she asked, not really wanting to be bothered with him. \"I want you to sing at the Beetle Ball. Tonight. You've got a beautiful voice, toots.\" He said, his mustache tickling the side of Thumbelina's face. She swatted it away. \"N-no, thank you. I have someone I need to find.\" She politely declined. Genevieve was somewhere out there, and she needed to find her. But, Berkley Beetle didn't take 'no' for an answer. He continued to flirt and persuade, until Thumbelina reluctantly agreed to sing at the Beetle Ball. Then, she looked over at Jacquimo. \"Oh, but, what about Jacquimo?\" \"Who?\" \"My friend. He was helping me find my sister, but he got tired. I can't just leave him here.\" Thumbelina then remembered something Genevieve taught her. She grabbed a leaf, a small blade of grass, and some clumpy dirt. She wrote a message on the leaf to Jacquimo. Dear Jacquimo, I'll be back soon. Thumbelina After gently placing the note under his wing, Thumbelina nodded to Mr. Beetle. \"Okay. I'm ready.\" Berkley lifted her up and flew her to the entrance of the tree. \"We're gonna be the talk of the town, toots!\" \"I'm not your toots. And, this is a one-time thing, we agreed!\" she countered as she was pulled into the club for the Beetle Ball. … While Genevieve helped Bank and Siloma with their everyday chores, she grew much closer to them. She felt as though Siloma and Bank were her brother and sister. They felt the same of her. But, Genevieve still worried about her sister, Thumbelina. She needed to know if she was okay, at the very least. Siloma decided to weave some winter clothes for Genevieve out of spider silk. Once she was done, Bank fashioned together some winter boats for her out of old material he'd found in the woods. When they presented these items to Genevieve, she was overjoyed. \"Oh, thank you! Thank you.\" She said. Then, she went behind a curtain to try them on. The clothes and boats fit her perfectly, hugging her form enough to give her warmth, but loose enough to give her comfort. Siloma smiled as she went over to Genevieve and started to braid her hair to keep it out of the way. \"We know of someone who may be able to help you locate Thumbelina.\" \"You do?\" Genevieve asked. \"Who is it?\" \"Bank's brother. He's another moth, but he's very high up in society. Almost like he's royalty.\" Siloma told her, causing Bank to scowl at the mere mention of his brother. \"He'll have somemoth tell us where she is.\" Genevieve smiled, feeling a new sense of hope wash over her. With Bank and Siloma with her, she knew she'd be able to find Thumbelina and get them home safely.[Chapter 5] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 5: Freezing Weather Yay! The internet got fixed and I'm back, readers! Enjoy! Thumbelina cried, thinking back to the humiliating events of the Beetle Ball. Everyone had loved and enjoyed her being there at the beginning… until they found out she wasn't really a beetle. She had a costume on with wings. Then, everyone had called her ugly. Jacquimo flew over to her and landed beside her. Thumbelina looked up at him, then back at her hands on her lap. \"What is the matter, Thumbelina?\" he asked. \"I'm cold… and I'm hungry… and, the beetle said I'm ugly.\" She hid her face in her hands. \"Do you love the beetle?\" Jacquimo asked. \"No!\" \"Then, never mind the beetle! Good riddance to the beetle!\" Thumbelina nodded, understanding what Jacquimo meant. She didn't love Mr. Beetle, so his opinion didn't matter. \"Does Prince Cornelius think you are ugly?\" Jacquimo asked her softly. \"No… He thinks I'm beautiful.\" He turned her around so she could see her reflection in a water droplet. \"And, so you are. Look.\" Thumbelina smiled. \"I'm gonna find Genny… and, then, we're going back home.\" Jacquimo settled in to sleep. Thumbelina crawled next to him. \"Jacquimo… do you think you could find the princes? Maybe if we all search together, we could find Genevieve faster.\" \"*yawn* I promise. But, now… we must rest.\" He said, pulling his hat over his face. … The harsh winter winds blew roughly against Genevieve's face. She tried her best to shield her eyes from the snow with her hands. \"Thumbelina!\" she called. She looked around for her sister, but she couldn't see through the snow. Siloma held onto Genevieve's wrist. \"Come on. We're almost there.\" She assured her as the trio trudged through the snow. Genevieve looked back at Bank. He seemed to be the only one dawdling, like he didn't want to see his own brother. She wondered what his brother was like. Then, they finally reached the door of the large tree with golden lights shining within it. Genevieve, shivering from the intense temperature drop, ran to the door and knocked on it hard. \"Please, I need your help!\" she cried. She slid down to the ground, still holding the door handle. \"P-please?\" she stuttered from the cold. The door swung open, dragging Genevieve inside. A minuscule moth looked down at her and gasped. \"Oh, my goodness! You poor dear!\" she shrieked, seeing Genevieve slightly covered in a blanket of snow and shivering so harshly, she could fall apart. Siloma helped the moth pull Genevieve to her feet as Bank walked past them all into the throne room. \"B-Bank?\" Genevieve stammered, bewildered. Once Bank reached his destination, he was greeted with a chorus of frightened gasps and angry glares. The only moth that gave no external reaction was a very large moth, wearing a royal suit made entirely of gold and a golden crown. He smiled at Bank. \"Hello, brother. So good to see you again.\" Bank glared at him. He turned back to see Genevieve with a shawl wrapped around her shoulders, walking toward him. Siloma and the other moth were close behind. \"Bank, why'd you run off like that?\" Once Genevieve was in view, all the moths stared at her. Most of them taught she was very brave to walk into the Royal Council without permission. Others taught she was very foolish for that act. Once Siloma and the other moth reached the door, they brought themselves to the ground in a bowing gesture. \"May we enter, King Drake?\" Everyone looked toward the moth dressed in gold. He chuckled and said, \"You may.\" Siloma stood up quickly and went over to stand next to Genevieve. \"Ask him for help.\" She whispered to her. \"Oh! Um… Excuse me, sir, but I was hoping you could help me.\" Genevieve started to say. She raised her hand to get Drake's attention. Prince Christopher's ring caused the entire room to shine and glow. All the moths in the room, save Siloma and Bank, looked at her as if they were in a trance. Genevieve quickly put her hand down and covered the ring. \"I'm sorry! I didn't know that would happen.\" She apologized quickly, thinking she had hurt them somehow. Drake stood up. \"Nonsense, my dear. There's no harm done.\" He then snapped his fingers [yes, the moths in my story have fingers] at a group of maids nearby. \"You, there! Please, tend to this beautiful young woman's every need while she and her… visitors are here. They will be staying with us until spring comes again.\" As the maid moths swarmed around Genevieve, she tried to protest. \"Oh, no, we can't stay until spring! See, my sister is missing, and-\" \"Now, now!\" Drake interrupted her. \"It's the least I can do. And, tonight, we will have a feast. You must be starving.\" The maids dragged Genevieve away, though she still tried to tell Drake about her need to find Thumbelina. Siloma followed after them, but turned back towards Bank, who was glaring daggers into Drake. She grabbed his shoulder. \"Come on, Bank. Now isn't the time.\" She whispered as she turned back to catch up with Genevieve. Bank followed her slowly. Once they had left, Drake chuckled as he stood up. \"My friends… that beautiful creature is going to be my queen.\" He said, pointing to where Genevieve was taken. … Meanwhile, the Fairy Princes were flying on Buzzby, trying to search through the snow. \"Thumbelina!\" \"Genevieve! Where are you?!\" Just then, a rough wind knocked Buzzby of balance. Both princes went tumbling into the surface. While Christopher landed in a large pile of snow… Cornelius fell into the edge of the lake. He tried to swim to the surface, but the water froze just as his index finger was above water. Thumbelina's forget-me-not necklace blew in the wind, catching slightly on his finger, before blowing away. Christopher poked his head out from underneath the snow pile. He shivered uncontrollably and tried to catch his balance. \"C-C-C-Cornelius?\" he called out, though his voice seemed muted due to the harsh winds. \"W-w-where are y-you?\" He looked around until he saw a group of beetles trudging by. He quickly hid behind the snow pile he'd fallen in and listened to their leader talk… complain, actually. \"I can't believe this! I have to be that toad's sidekick and nab the prince for him, all because of that Thumbelina!\" Berkley grumbled. Christopher gasped inaudibly. \"Hey, boss! Here's the prince! Right here.\" One of the beetles dressed in white said, pointing toward Cornelius' finger. Berkley Beetle jumped up in the air and cheered. \"Yes! Somebody up there loves me! All right, boys. Let's hail this Prince-icle back to Grundel.\" The beetles scraped their shoes against the frozen lake surface and stomped on it, causing Cornelius to rise out of the water, incased in a large ice cube. The beetles hauled him back to Grundel as Christopher crept away to get him some help. … \"Please! Tell him we can't stay until spring!\" Genevieve shouted, feeling very frustrated. No one was even acting like she was talking, let alone paying her any attention. \"Oh, nonsense! King Drake has invited you and your friends as guests in the Royal Palace. You cannot say refuse a king.\" One of the moth maids, Mary was her name, said. There were 3 moth maids that were fixing the golden dress that Genevieve had been given in place of her torn winter clothes. As most of the moths had names beginning with 'M', the moth maids were named Mary, Miriam, and Margaret. Genevieve threw her arms up in frustration. \"Ugh! Where are Siloma and Bank?\" Miriam cackled. It wasn't a very pleasant sound. \"They weren't even supposed to be allowed to live after the stunt Bank pulled.\" \"Miriam!\" Margaret chided, lightly smacking Miriam's arm. She looked back to Genevieve. \"Now, dear, let's get you ready for the feast. It's very important that you look your very best for King Drake.\" \"Why?\" Genevieve asked. Mary placed a golden wreath of yellow autumn leaves on top of Genevieve's head. \"No reason.\" Miriam chuckled, which was no more pleasing to hear than her cackle. Meanwhile, Drake and one of his most loyal advisors, Marius, were having a discussion regarding Genevieve. \"My King, how do you plan to woo the young lady?\" Marius questioned. Drake glared at him. \"It's simple, you twit. During the feast, I'll show her what splendor she'd have the pleasure of enjoying if she were my queen! Then, I'll propose to her, she'll say yes, and we'll be wed.\" Marius inwardly chuckled in amusement. \"What is your plan if she refuses?\" Drake glared at his advisor. \"And, why would she refuse me?!\" \"As we all can see, she is quite beautiful. She may already be betrothed.\" Marius said, causing Drake to scowl at the thought. If she was already promised to another, how would he be able to get rid of him? Just then, a moth ran up to them, looking startled and frightened. \"Your Highness! Your Highness! The young woman you've invited into the Court… she's one of the Fairy Princes' love! They've been going around looking for her and her sister! Prince Cornelius was proclaimed dead, but his cousin lives! Prince Christopher is the one that loves the young lady…\" he said quickly, hoping for mercy from Drake for this unwelcome news. Drake's face contorted from a menacing grimace to an evilly grin. He turned towards Marius and said, \"Go with this moth to find this Fairy Prince. I know now how to get my queen to say 'yes.'\"[Chapter 6] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 6: Choices and Decisions Thumbelina had tried to find shelter in an old boot while Jacquimo looked for the Princes. She hoped she would be able to find her sister soon, so they could go home to their mother. She had passed out from the cold, and awoken in the humble home of a mouse. \"W-where am I?\" she asked, still feeling a little chilly. Ms. Field Mouse turned around to see that Thumbelina was awake. \"You're in my home, Thumbelina, underground. I brought you in from the harsh weather outside.\" She said, chuckling. \"Did you really think you could survive the whole winter in that filthy, old boot?\" Thumbelina sat on the edge of the bed she was placed in. \"How do you know my name?\" \"Oh, everyone knows about you, dearie. Your sister, too. And, how you two were in love with the princes. Cornelius and Christopher, I believe?\" \"Yes… 'Were?'\" Thumbelina asked. \"Oh, it's so sad. Prince Cornelius was found stone-cold dead in the snow and Prince Christopher was taken by the moth King.\" Thumbelina felt like her heart had been ripped into pieces. She collapsed against the bed and sobbed. \"Cornelius? No, NO!\" Ms. Field Mouse clicked her tongue. \"Oh, I apologize, Thumbelina. I just say things without thinking, sometimes.\" Thumbelina buried her face into a nearby pillow. She cried for Cornelius' death, her loss of her true love… and, she cried for Genevieve. Her sister was none the wiser of Prince Christopher's disappearance. He could very well have been dead, as well. She felt so empty and numb. Even if she didn't know Cornelius more than a day, she felt like they were soul mates, that true love had finally entered her life. Only for it to be tragically ripped away from her. She was taken away form her thoughts by Ms. Field Mouse's voice. \"Now, now, dear. We'll take some corncakes to my neighbor, Mr. Mole. That'll take your mind off things.\" Thumbelina really didn't feel like it, but she decided to go anyway. Anything was better than just wallowing in her grief. Ms. Field Mouse gave her a shawl and started walking towards a tunnel that led to Mr. Mole's house. \"He must have been looking for me… That's what must have happened.\" She whispered to herself guiltily. Her prince was dead… and, it was all her fault. … At the feast, the only thing on Genevieve's mind was finding Thumbelina. What if she was dead? Her sister could be lying lifeless on the ground, and where was she? At a party, that's where! But, there really wasn't anything she could do about having to sit there and enjoy the festivities. Every time she tried to talk to King Drake about finding her sister, something new started and the moth maids sat her back down. Genevieve was starting to think the feast would never end. Then, the sound of a wine glass being struck lightly with a fork [yeah, they have silverware and wine glasses, too. Deal, it's a fanfic! :3] interrupted everything. Everyone looked to see King Drake putting down his glass and fork and walking over to Genevieve. He pulled her out in front of everyone and proclaimed loudly, \"Every one, listen up!\" Once he had everyone's attention, he turned to Genevieve. \"Dear Genevieve… I want to give you the honor of being my queen. Marry me.\" He said, getting down on one knee and taking one of her hands in his own. Genevieve quickly pulled her hand away. \"I'm sorry, but I must refuse.\" She said, erupting a gasp from everyone. Siloma and Bank were the only ones not surprised. Drake, on the other hand, was furious. \"Why not?!\" he shouted. Genevieve looked down at the ring on her finger and smiled. \"I'm in love with someone else.\" Drake chuckled darkly. \"You mean that Fairy Prince… Christopher?\" Genevieve gasped silently as Drake snapped his fingers at his advisor and another moth. \"Don't try to deny it's him, Genevieve. I already know.\" Marius came back out with a small golden cage that had a tarp draped over it. Genevieve glanced at the cage, frightened. \"W-what's going on?\" she asked. \"You see, from the moment you stepped into my Royal Court, I've been planning to marry you and make you Queen of the Moths! But… since you refused, I'll have to force you to marry me.\" Drake stalked over to the cage and ripped the tarp off, revealing Prince Christopher. Christopher looked up and saw his lady love, his Genevieve… slightly crying. He stood up and glared at Drake. \"What have you done to Genevieve?!\" he shouted, gripping the bars of the cage. Drake laughed. \"Nothing… yet.\" Then, he went back over to Genevieve. Before he could make it over to her, she ran passed him and to Christopher's outstretched hand. \"Oh, Christopher!\" she sobbed, taking his hand in hers. \"I'm sorry, Genevieve.\" Christopher said, gently kissing Genevieve's hand. \"I should have searched faster.\" Drake, sick of watching them together, snapped his fingers. \"Enough! Guards, bring her back over to me!\" he shouted. Two guards went over and pulled the two apart. Genevieve struggled against the guards' grip, trying to get back over to Christopher. \"Let her go!\" Christopher yelled, shaking the bars of his cage in an attempt to break free. Once the guards had Genevieve in front of Drake, they let her go and went to stand in front of Christopher's cage, blocking him from view. \"Please,\" Genevieve begged, \"let him go.\" \"I'm afraid that isn't part of the plan. Here is my offer. Marry me, and I may be generous enough to let him live. If you still refuse… we stick him in the ember pits.\" \"E-ember pits?\" \"Sticky sap that hardens in the cold. I must say, it isn't a very pleasant way to go.\" Drake said, making Genevieve's eyes start to tear up again. \"So, my sweet… what will it be?\" Genevieve started sobbing into her hands. She had to choose between marrying this horrible moth and being the cause of Christopher's death. She knew the choice she would have to make… \"I can't let Christopher die…\" she said, and then finished in a whisper. \"I will marry you.\" \"Excellent! Get the wedding together! We marry tonight!\" He said, making the moths rejoice in the news. Bank and Siloma slipped away to follow Marius as he pushed Christopher's cage away. Christopher sat still in his cage, not having any fight in him anymore. He had heard everything… Drake's offer, what would become of him if Genevieve refused him again… and, how miserable Genevieve sounded when she had no choice but to accept. If only he could get out of here, he would rescue her and take her away from this awful place. She'd never have to remember this whole experience because he would never let her. Meanwhile, a few moth maids flew Genevieve up to a large cage hovering above the Royal Court. \"Just in case my fiancée tries to escape.\" Drake said. As the door was latched shut, Genevieve turned her back to Drake and the other moths. She didn't want to look at them anymore. She didn't want to think about anything… but, Christopher and Thumbelina. They needed her, and she had let them both down. She started crying, then looked down and saw Bank, mingled in with the other moths that were all leaving. Once the last one was gone, Bank flew back up to her. \"What is it, Bank?\" After a few hisses and clicks, Bank face-palmed himself. He flew down to some scraps of paper and grabbed a few. He scribbled something on them and then flew back. His messages read: \" We're going to release Christopher\" \" Don't worry.\" \" We'll get you back to your sister.\" Genevieve smiled and felt tears of joy sting her eyes. She nodded, so Bank would know she had read the messages. He flew out of the room with one final wave goodbye. … Jacquimo had been flying around, searching for the Fairy Princes when he came across some beetles dragging a large ice cube along with them. That's when Jacquimo had seen a finger sticking out of the top. He flew closer to investigate. He listened in on the leader beetle talk to Grundel. \"Listen, Grundel. Here's your fairy. Now, gimme my wings back!\" he shouted. Grundel held Berkley's wings out of reach. He smiled darkly at the sight of the fairy prince, trapped in an eternal prison of ice. \"Good. I go find Thumbelina, bring her here, and make her marry me!\" he shouted in triumph. He dragged Berkley along with him. \"Hey! Wait a second! What's the big idea?!\" Berkley Beetle shouted as he was drug along the cold ground by his foot. The other beetles followed them. Once Jacquimo deemed it safe to emerge from his hiding spot, he flew over to the prince. \"Do not worry, Prince Cornelius. I will unthaw you.\" He looked around for some twigs or small pieces of bark to start a fire, but found none. He shrugged, resorting to what he had handy. [Warning! Extreme funniness to occur!] Jacquimo started huffing onto the ice cube, hoping his hot breath was enough to thaw it. \"Do not worry! *Huff!*It is working! *HUFF!*\" As he huffed, he looked down at his feet and saw a pile of sticks directly under his feet. \"Seriously?\" he muttered aloud. … Thumbelina sat down, thinking about the events that had transpired during her visit to Mr. Mole. He was blind, but seemed to know exactly where she was. During the visit, she had heard Mr. Mole and Ms. Field Mouse talking, but she was too far away to hear exactly what about. Once they had returned to Ms. Field Mouse's home, she was quickly informed of the conversation. \"You see, Thumbelina, Mr. Mole's become very fond of you. He wants to marry you.\" \"But, I can't marry Mr. Mole!\" \"And, why not?\" \"I don't love him.\" Thumbelina rested her elbows on her knees. \"'Love?' Love's what we read about in books, my dear.\" Ms. Field Mouse said, chuckling. She slid into a pincushion as she sang. [Yes, the one song from the movie I'm using is the one I think everyone hates. Really, this song got an award for being awful! Well, here it is…] \"' Here comes the bride' is a lovely little ditty, But, marrying for love is a foolish thing to do. Cause love won't pay the mortgage, or put porridge in your bowl Dearie, Marry the Mole!\" Ms. Field Mouse put on a makeshift wedding dress from the fabric she was using for Thumbelina's wedding dress. As she tried a string around her waist she sang: \" True, it's a fact that he's not exactly witty He's blind-er than a bat, but at least his eyes are blue. His breath may be alarming, but he's charming… for a troll Dearie, Marry the Mole!\" She stood up on a pedestal as she continued. \" Romeo and Juliet Where very much in love when they were wed. They honored every vow, so where are they now? They're dead, DEAD! Very, very dead!\" \" Poor Thumbelina, your brain so itty-bitty I hate to seem a pest, but I know what's best for you. Just think of all the ways that you can decorate a hole! Take my advice. I'll bring the rice! Dearie… Marry the Mole!\" Ms. Field Mouse's song took a jazzy turn as she pulled some fabric, causing heaps of rice to fall around them. \"Marry the Mole!\" she spun around Thumbelina as she wrapped the fabric around Thumbelina. \"Marry that Mole!\" \"' M' is for Money!\" \" Oh!\" Thumbelina gasped. \" L. E!\" The [terrible] song had left Thumbelina feeling that she didn't really have a choice in the matter. She decided to do what Ms. Field Mouse had advised. She would marry the mole.[Chapter 7] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 7: Daring Rescue Genevieve's thoughts had been filled with the possibilities of the life she would be forced to have with Drake the moth. She highly doubted she would ever be happy again. All she wanted was to get back to Christopher and find Thumbelina. As the moth maids prepared her for the wedding, they proceeded to cut her hair to a little past shoulder length and put her in a white gown with gold trimming. She sighed, thinking about how she could've saved her true love. At that very same moment, Christopher sat awake, thinking the same thing. He was so swept up in his thoughts, he hadn't noticed that two moths had entered the room he was being held in and released him from the cage. \"Who are you?\" he asked cautiously. \"Friends of Genevieve. We've got to hurry! Bank's got a plan for when the other moths attack.\" Siloma said. Christopher followed them as they lead him back to the Royal Court. \"Going somewhere?\" a menacing voice called form behind them. None of them turned around to see who was addressing them, they already knew. Drake snapped his fingers and some moths flew in front of them, blocking them from getting to the Court. Christopher turned to face Drake, anger sketched across his face. He drew his sword and shouted, \"I've had enough of you, Drake!\" With that; he stepped forward, ready to strike. Drake pushed him back, causing him to stumble into the Royal court room. Genevieve turned around, startled by the sounds of fighting, to see her one true love fighting the horrible moth king. Drake pulled out a sword of his own and started fighting with the Fairy Prince. \"Never again will you live to bring me misery!\" he grunted. \"Funny,\" Christopher countered. \"I was going to say the same thing. Only with much more hatred.\" While their swords clanged together, Bank flew up to Genevieve's cage. He tried to jimmy the lock open with some scrap metal he'd found. Genevieve was too worried about trying to see if Christopher ever got hurt, she didn't notice that she was leaning so hard on the door of the cage. When Bank opened it, she flew out and screamed. Christopher looked in her direction, but received a cut on his arm from the distraction. He hissed in pain, but ignored his opponent. He flew as fast a he could to Genevieve and caught her in mid-air. She clung to him for dear life and sobbed. \"Oh, Christopher! Don't ever leave me again.\" She cried into his chest. \"I wouldn't dare.\" He replied. Bank and Siloma flew over with a large piece of a mirror. \"Genevieve, hold up your ring.\" Siloma instructed. Genevieve obeyed, causing the room to fill with light once more. At that point, all the moths who were gathering for the wedding were so entranced by the light; they didn't notice Bank and Siloma positioning the mirror in front of the light. The light blinded the moths and caused them to run around in a fit of panic. \"Let's get out of here.\" Christopher said. Genevieve held onto him tighter as they flew off. Once they were a safe distance away from the Moth Castle, the group rested near a hole in the ground. While Siloma and Bank tried to figure out how they would find Genevieve's sister, Genevieve hugged Christopher tightly. \"Oh, I missed you, Christopher.\" \"I missed you, too, Genevieve.\" He said, looking into her eyes. Just as their lips inched closer together, a young mouse ran by them, yelling, \"Big wedding! The rich Mr. Mole is to wed the beautiful Thumbelina!\" Genevieve gasped. Her sister was marrying a mole? How could that be?! \"We've got to stop that wedding! Where does Mr. Mole live?\" she asked Siloma. Just then, they heard a wedding march being played. They looked down into the hole near them to see the entire wedding happening right underneath them. Genevieve gasped when she saw her sister walking down the isle towards Mr. Mole. \"What is she doing?\" she whispered. \"What about Prince Cornelius?!\" Just as Christopher was about to tell her the awful news, they saw that Thumbelina seemed a bit distracted as she made her way to the alter. Genevieve started climbing down into the hole to hear what was going on. \"Mr. Mole, do you take Thumbelina to be your lawfully wedded wife?\" the minister asked. \"I do.\" Mr. Mole said. \"Thumbelina, do you take Mr. Mole to be your lawfully wedded husband?\" Mr. Mole looked over at Thumbelina, patiently awaiting her response. Thumbelina mumbled something that… almost sounded like she said, \"Never.\" \"Speak up, child!\" The minister said. Thumbelina turned toward him with an angry look on her face. \"Never.\" She said clearly. Everyone gasped as Thumbelina looked around and said, \"I don't love him!\" \"Thumbelina!\" Ms. Field Mouse exclaimed, clearly shocked by Thumbelina's choice. Genevieve, however, was elated that her sister made the right choice. She climbed fully into the hole and landed on her knees near the back of the room. Christopher flew in after her just as a large toad came crashing through the ceiling. \"I marry her!\" he shouted, throwing his arms into the air happily. Thumbelina glared at him. \"I don't even know who you are! What makes you think I'd marry you?!\" she shouted. Then, she huffed in annoyance and stomped away. Grundel tried to grab her arm as she walked by, but she pushed him away, causing him to collapse into a group of rodents. \"Thumbelina!\" Genevieve called as she followed her sister. Thumbelina turned around and stared in shock at her sister. She had to pinch herself to make sure she wasn't having a hallucination. \"Genevieve!\" she cried happily as she threw her arms around her sister. \"Where have you been?\" \"I could ask you the same question!\" Genevieve chuckled. \"C'mon, let's get outta here.\" Just then, Mr. Mole, Grundel, and a group of mice and rats started shouting after them. \"Thumbelina! Come back!\" Mr. Mole's voice rang out. Genevieve grabbed her sister's hand and ran down the tunnel. Genevieve looked back at her prince. \"Christopher, come on!\" \"I'll hold them off! Go on!\" He called back to her, facing the oncoming hoard. Genevieve quickly ran back to him and kissed his cheek. She ran back down the tunnel to her sister and went with her into the darkness. Christopher held his sword up at the group of rodents, plus 1 toad. \"Halt!\" They all slid to a stop, with Mr. Mole and Grundel in front of them all. \"I suggest you leave the young lady alone. She doesn't wish to marry you now, nor will she ever.\" He said to the two. \"She already had a love once. But, she lost him to the winter weather.\" \"And, that love is me.\" A familiar voice said from behind him. Christopher turned to see his, once dead, cousin fly over to him. He smiled and hugged him tightly. \"I missed you, too, Chris.\" Cornelius said, already knowing what his cousin was going to say. Just then, they heard Genevieve scream. \"Genevieve!\" Christopher gasped as he flew down the tunnel, with Cornelius close by. ... \"Oh, my gosh! What is that thing?!\" Genevieve shrieked at the sight of Berkley Beetle as she hid behind Thumbelina. \"Just a nasty beetle.\" Thumbelina huffed quietly. \"Hiya, toots!\" Mr. beetle said. Then, he eyed Genevieve. \"Who's the dame?\" \"I don't like beetles.\" Genevieve said. \"You and me both.\" Her sister responded as she pulled her further into the tunnel. Berkley attempted to follow after them, but lost his balance when a gust of wind flew by him. He looked to see the Fairy Princes flying after the two girls. Then, he almost got trampled by the crowd of people following them, most of which were calling after Thumbelina. \"Thumbelina!\" Cornelius called out as he and Christopher got closer to the girls. Thumbelina turned around and gasped. She felt tears sting her eyes as her love flew over to her and hugged her tightly. She returned the hug with just as much force as she cried. \"Oh, Cornelius! I thought you were...\" she couldn't continue because she was crying too hard. Cornelius smiled at her. \"It's all right, now. I'm never letting you out of my sight again.\" he said, making Thumbelina smile. \"Sorry to break up the love fest, but we've got a swarm of angry mice behind us.\" Genevieve said. The couple turned around to see the rodents catching up to them. Both princes picked up their girls bride-style and flew out of the end of the tunnel. ... Once they landed safely away from any danger, Cornelius turned to Thumbelina. \"Thumbelina, I'm sorry that I couldn't find you before you had to agree to marry that mole. and, I'm sorry to put you such heartbreak when you thought I was dead. But, if you'd let me, I'd like to dedicate spending the rest of our lives making it up to you.\" \"Genevieve,\" Christopher started to say. \"I'm sorry you had to be put in that difficult situation with... the moth king. but, I'm going to do everything in my power to fill your days with so much joy and laughter that you never remember that awful place.\" \"Both princes got down on one knee and said simultaneously, \"Will you marry me?\" Both girls gasped. \"Of course, I'll marry you!\" Genevieve screamed as she hugged Prince Christopher. \"Oh, I will.\" Thumbelina sighed as she hugged Prince Cornelius. Both couples kissed at the same time. Genevieve and Thumbelina gasped when they felt themselves slightly float above the tree branch they had been standing on. Thumbelina looked back to see that she had a pair of translucent yellow wings. Genevieve had a pair of shining light blue wings. The sisters smiled at one another. \"Genny, you have wings!\" \"So do you!\" They flew back to their fiances and kissed them again, so happy to be reunited with each other.[Chapter 8] Thumbelina and Genevieve Chapter 8: Wedding Bells Music flourished throughout the Vale of the Fairies as all the fairies, Bank, Siloma, and Thumbelina and Genevieve's mother turned their heads to see the twins walking down the isle to their princes. Thumbelina was wearing a white ball-gown style wedding dress and a white headdress that held all of her hair inside of it. Genevieve was wearing an off-the-shoulder gown with a sparkling headband. Once they reached the alter, the wedding proceeded. There wasn't a dry eye in the Vale. During the reception, Genevieve and Christopher went up to Siloma and Bank. \"Where will you two go now?\" Genevieve asked. Bank shrugged. \"I suppose we'll go back to our tree stump.\" Siloma said. Genevieve gave Christopher a pleading look, making him smile. \"Would you like to stay in the Vale with us?\" he asked. \"We could give you both jobs!\" Genevieve suggested. she tapped her chin as she thought. \"You two can be... the Heads of Defense!\" \"Heads of Defense?\" Siloma questioned. Bank gave an equally questioning gaze. \"Seeing as how you were able to take down a whole swarm of moths, you two would be perfect for the job.\" Christopher said. Siloma looked at Bank, who shrugged. \"Well, if you'd like us to stay, then... we'd be glad to.\" Genevieve hugged them both. \"Thank you... for everything.\" \"You're welcome, Genevieve.\" Siloma chuckled. Just then, a certain swallow flew over to Thumbelina and Cornelius. \"Jaquimo!\" Thumbelina gasped happily. \"Hello, Thumbelina and Cornelius. This is such a beautiful wedding.\" He looked around at the scenery. Cornelius stepped forward. \"I never got the chance to thank you for unfreezing me. How can I ever repay you?\" Jaquimo chuckled. \"Just keep Thumbelina happy.\" Cornelius chuckled as he hugged Thumbelina. \"Oh, of course.\" \"Thank you, Jaquimo.\" Thumbelina smiled. Then, she hugged her swallow friend. Jaquimo flew off into the sky as everyone waved him good-bye. \"who was that?\" Genevieve asked. Thumbelina chuckled. \"I'll tell you all about him.\" Well, that's the end. I know it was short, but I've discovered something about me... I can't write wedding scenes. I just can't. Anyway, did you like it? Reviews, please! :3 ","Summary":" Hello, gumdrops and cottonballs! The internet was down last month, so... yeah... We're still not en"},{"Movie":"Little Giants","Title":"Sin titulo todavia","Author":"YuMeNaRaSuMeTa","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8307219","Passage":"[Chapter 1] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 1 Eran las 7 de la mañana en un perfecto día de sábado donde no hay que preocuparse de la escuela, del desayuno y puedes dormir esos minutitos extra que son el paraíso, para cualquier estudiante harto de la semana o simplemente un trabajador que ya no puede con su empleo y esta fastidiado del jefe, haaaaa si esas mañanas eran la gloria para cualquiera. Pero no para becky o shea mejor conocida como la hielera, la única chica en todo Urbania que disfrutaba tacklear a los chicos en vez de abalanzarse como cualquier adolescente con hormonas lo haría, la única que podía terminar arriba y debajo de ellos y sin la tentación de besarles o querer un apretujón y eso que si quisiera, ella lo conseguiría porque al ser la única chica en el equipo tenia sus ventajas. Así que ya sabrán la sorpresa que todo el mundo se llevo al enterarse que la mismísima becky O shea, la hielera, la chica que tuvo que pelear con uñas y dientes, había renunciado al equipo de futbol, todos tenían la pregunta en la boca y al mismo tiempo todos tenían la respuesta en la punta de la lengua, ¿Por qué había renunciado al equipo? Y sin embrago la respuesta era obvia, había dos razones una la que todos podían ver y confirmar la hielera era una chica y todos lo veían y joder se había estado desarrollando muy bien en el área de los pechos, no había chico que no se fijara en esa parte de su anatomía y segundo con eso de crecer también venia un amigo compañero de toda mujer, si era molesto he incomodo cuando un chico se te acercaba ahora tener a todos los del equipo y con esos calambres era una tortura y eso que lo había estado manejando bien, pero cuando quiso ducharse después del entrenamiento para poder sentirse limpia, esos malditos demonios que se llaman hombres se les habían olvidado que ella era una mujer!, apenas habían entrado cuando ella empezó a gritar y a maldecir, el entrenador tuvo que entrar en acción, pero por lo apresurado del momento no se fijo que la pobre de becky estaba en las duchas y desnuda gracias a dios no pudo ver nada digo casi ella agarro la toalla y como pudo se le acerco y el pobre recibió un puñetazo, a lo que después vendría una disculpa por parte de la hielera. Así que aquí estaba a las 7 de la mañana y sin conciliar el sueño, pensando en todo lo que había pasado en toda la maldita semana, y tratando de volver a dormir pero era imposible, todos esos años de entrenar temprano habían hecho en ella la costumbre de levantarse a esas horas de la mañana. Poco a poco empezó a escuchar ruido por el pasillo era Junior que se estaba preparando para entrenar, hace 5 años que el padre de ella y la madre de el se habían casado y desde hace 5 años ella ya no sentía nada por el, el hecho que se convirtiera en su hermanastro le quitaba el encanto a todo ese lio amoroso que pudo haber tenido, además de sumarle las incontables novias que por su casa habían pasado, hasta incluso llego a encontrar a junior ya a una rubia pelos pintados Sandra creía que se llamaba en una pose muy comprometedora y no es que ella fuera muy inocente, pero eso de encontrarse a tu hermano con los pantalones abajo y con eso colgando entre sus piernas y a la rubiecita con las tetas de fuera, era traumante dijeran lo que dijeran. Ahora becky no era ninguna ingenua en eso de las relaciones había tenido dos intentos de novios, que a sus 16 años no sabia si era bueno o malo, cada vez que trataba de iniciar una relación, junior lo miraba con ojos asesinos, el tío Kevin le hacia la vida imposible y los chicos del equipo lo amenazaban, el único que tenia voz y voto era su padre pero el siempre la defendía diciendo que confiaba plenamente en ella y que si además algo le llegara a pasar ya estaba todo cubierto, ella no sabia como tomarlo, debía sentirse halagada con eso de que confía en ella u ofendida? digo era su única hija debería estar con un mazo en la mano y un garrote en la otra para defenderla de los desgraciados que intentaban llevársela y depravarla ( según las palabras del tío Kevin). De repente se escucho unos golpes en la puerta. -Becky – se escucho detrás de la puerta- becky estas despierta? Al ver que nadie contestaba el chico decidió entrar sin ser invitado y vio a su hermana acostada boca arriba con una almohada en la cara,- vamos deja de jugar se que estas despierta, siempre estas despierta a esta hora de la mañana, mientras decía esto le quito la almohada de la cara mirándola con una expresión divertida mientras ella le regresaba la mirada con una de frustración- que haces aquí no puedes atarte los zapatos tu solito? El le miro ya estaba acostumbrado a esos arranques no por nada era la hielera- el entrenador quiere verte, me dijo que fueras hoy quería darte la semana para que descansaras después del incidente – y todo esto lo dijo con una sonrisilla en los labios el muy maldito se estaba burlando, al escucharlo becky entono su rostro con maravillosas tonalidades de rojo muy variadas, junior al ver esto dejo salir una sonora carcajada por lo que becky se encogió y se escondió debajo de las sabanas – vamos dijo el chico sentándose en la orilla de la cama –no es para tanto, al decir esto la chica saco la cabeza de su escondite y le lanzo una mirada asesina- que no es para tanto LE PEGE AL ENTRENADOR HARRISON ( y también me vio casi desnuda pero eso ya lo sabes no)- el chico entrecerró la ceja- fue por una muy buena razón beks si tu no lo hubieras hecho lo abría hecho yo, además el entiende porque lo hiciste no es un tarado pervertido, vamos la vergüenza tendrá que pasarte algún día y que mejor con empezar ahora, además ya le di su merecido a los dos chicos que estaban ahí también, nadie dirá nada eres la hielera o lo olvidas? Y con esas ultimas palabras Junior se levanto y salió de ahí corriendo antes que la almohada y otras cosas que pudieran estar cerca se convirtieran en armas letales en las manos de su hermana, pero Becky se quedo ahí sin mas mirando hacia la ventana – este va a hacer un día muy largo- pensó y poco a poco fue saliendo de la cama, se tomo su tiempo salir a la calle no era su prioridad así que cuando bajo y vio a Junior todavía en la casa le sorprendió – creíste que te iba a dejar sola?- Becky solo sonrió ante este gesto, era en estos momentos en los que agradecía tener un hermano, así que los dos salieron y fueron directo al campo de practica. Cuando llegaron ya todos los del equipo estaban ahí y en esos momentos estaban calentando, cuando el entrenador los vio primero le grito a Junior por llegar tarde y lo puso ha dar 10 vueltas por el campo, seguido de esto dejo un par de instrucciones al asistente Nubie que seguía vistiendo tan formal como Becky recordaba y era el genio detrás de esas jugadas que mas de una vez habían llevado a anotaciones e incluso a ganar el juego, cuando la vio parada con las manos dentro de la chaqueta, balanceando su peso de un pie a otro y mordiéndose el labio de forma nerviosa este le sonrió en forma conciliadora y ella le regreso el gesto, esto la tranquilizo un poco, Nubie era uno de los pocos amigos que aun conservaba después de ese gran partido, bueno los tiempos cambian pensó, después de que el entrenador diera instrucciones fijo su mirada en Becky, gran error un circulo morado se mostraba imponente en su ojo derecho ouch pensó becky, quizás esto no era una buena idea, tranquila pensó tu eres la hielera sea lo que sea que tenga que decirte lo aceptaras, mas fácil decirlo que hacerlo, de repente escucho que alguien se dirija a ella - O shea a la oficina- era el entrenador, este le dio una media sonrisa y se dirijo a el lugar, Becky solo pudo seguirle los pasos pero con una carga mas ligera sobre sus hombros. Así llegaron hasta la oficina del entrenador, y los dos tomaron sus respectivos asientos, becky por supuesto enfrente de el y unas ganas inmensas de reírse el ojo del entrenador se veía como manchas de uno de esos perros dálmatas – Becky, le dije Junior que te trajera porque necesitamos hablar sobre lo que sucedió la semana pasada- y así empieza, pensó la pobre muchacha , después de esa pausa el entrenador prosiguió con su ya esperado discurso parecía que lo había ensañado- El hecho es que – se callo por un momento paso su mano sobre su ya nulo cabello y siguió- es que ya eres una mujercita, y tu y yo sabíamos que ese factor nos iba a estorbar algún día, y este día ha llegado, lo que paso en las regaderas es solo la punta del iceberg- y todo esto lo dijo mirando a becky a los ojos, y ella solo se removió un poco en su asiento y este prosiguió - Pero, aun así me pareció una exageración que renunciaras al equipo- Becky no lo podía creer y la prueba estaba en que sus ojos se salieron casi la mitad de su orbita – vamos no me mires así, tu eres la que mas a trabajado para estar en el equipo y has puesto casi toda tu vida en este juego, perderte a ti seria perder una parte del equipo, no digo que salgas a jugar de inmediato si estas incomoda tomate unos días, y no te preocupes por esto- le dijo señalando su ojo – esto solo me pone mas tranquilo, saber que te defiendes incluso de mi ha- soltó una carcajada- en serio eres la hielera, pero en serio piénsalo Becky si no te sientes cómoda estando en el campo serias una muy buena asistente, lo que quiero decir es que me ayudarías entrenando a los muchachos, tienes lo que se necesita y además conoces a todos los del esquipo sabes como juegan y conoces sus fuertes y sus debilidades- Becky no lo podía creer, lo que pensaba que iba a ser una reprimenda y un gracias y buena suerte, esto era mas de lo que podía esperar, bueno tal vez se había precipitado al renunciar., entonces se dio cuenta que le tocaba hablar en ese momento – Entrenador yo- que le decía? – Perdón por el ojo de dálmata, digo perdón por su ojo- tontaaaaa se dijo- Perdón por eso, lo que quiero decir es que puedo tomarme un tiempo para pensarlo?- el entrenador solo la miro – se que no estas acostumbrada a estar fuera del campo, que tal si lo piensas mientras examino al nuevo chico, solo para que veas lo que deberás hacer como asistente, que te parece?- a lo que nuestra hielera solo asintió. Muy bien, esto era extraño un nuevo jugador? No había oído nada de eso y Junior no le había comentado nada, que estaba pasando aquí? Mientras salían al campo, Becky miro a todos los muchachos, todos se veían entre si, había tensión entre ellos, pero no era por ella o por el incidente del entrenador de hecho nadie les prestaba atención entonces lo vio., vio Junior rojo hasta las orejas en una posición amenazadora, estaba dando la cara hacia ella y parecía que iba a atacar a la persona que estaba enfrente de el, Becky no podía ver quien era, el cuerpo del otro chico estaba de espaldas a ella, de repente el entrenador se hizo escuchar – Que esta pasando aquí señoritas?, el entrenamiento no ha acabado- fue en ese entonces en que todos dirigieron su atención hacia ellos y el chico volteo, a Becky casi se le sale el corazón era el, no puede ser, maldita su suerte que decidió levantarse, mataría a Junior, maldita sea el muy bastardo volvió la ultima vez que lo vio estaba con unas esposas en su espalda y subiendo en la patrulla del sheriff y entonces se escucho- Hey porrista escuche que eres una gallina- y así se dio cuenta que esto era real y Spike había regresado al campo y a la ciudad. Este día iba a ser muy largo y ni siquiera eran las 11 de la mañana.[Chapter 2] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 2 No podía creerlo, simplemente no podía creerlo tan solo de pensar que en esos mismos momentos podía estar en su habitación en su cómoda cama y en esos confortables pijamas, maldito Junior lo mataría por haberla convencido., al diablo el equipo, al diablo el entrenador Harrison., Spike estaba ahí, es decir Spike Hammersmith estaba justo enfrente de ella y el muy desgraciado le había dicho porrista y gallina? espera un momento porque le había dicho gallina? Y fue ahí en ese mismo instante donde Becky O'Shea se dio cuenta, el lo sabia por dios todo el pueblo lo sabia, pero esto era diferente el que tu enemigo mortal se entere de lo peor que te ha sucedido en la vida, es personal y no ayuda en nada que ella no tuviera absolutamente nada en contra de el, Spike se había ido del pueblo hace dos años. La conducta agresiva y problemática lo había llevado a mas de una vez a la sala de detención, siempre se metía en problemas y no había día donde no tuviera un gran moretón o una marca a causa de las peleas en las que Becky sabia el era el incitador, esa manía de buscar pelea con los chicos de grado mas alto siempre le dejaban un recordatorio, un morado o a veces negro recordatorio de que siempre estaría listo para la pelea y el siempre salía airoso de la ronda de golpes. Pero había algo que Becky sabia y que tenia que darle crédito y aunque eso la hiciera casi vomitar el solo hecho de admitirlo, Spike era un gran jugador el mejor del equipo y la disciplina con la que trabajaba era increíble, en el campo de juego el y Junior hacían jugadas impresionantes, todas gracias al genio de Nubie claro esta, pero al hacer las jugadas parecía que fueran amigos de toda la vida, su sincronización era asombrosa y casi digo casi a Becky le parecía un muchacho no agradable pero si fácil de llevar, pero todo eso cambiaba en el segundo que la practica acababa o el partido terminaba entonces regresaba el Spike agresivo, altanero y problemático que siempre había existido y que Becky sabia que no importa cuanto tiempo pasara o cuantos años el se fuera, el solo era una cosa, problemas y este chico tenia muchos. Así que en esos momentos la tensión se sentía como respirar plomo, Becky tuvo que respirar, tenia un montón de insultos listos para dejar su boca y lanzarlas a toda velocidad a la cara altanera que tenia enfrente, pero el entrenador Harrison sabia cuando actuar no era secreto que esos dos se odiaban a muerte y si era necesario La Hielera le haría tragarse sus palabras con una buena racha de puños y viendo el panorama general no seria la única, Junior estaba listo para atacar -Ya basta, O'Shea quiero 10 vueltas al campo, los demás listos para comenzar y tu – dirigiéndose a Spike - A mi oficina ya – todos se quedaron quietos y expectantes nadie movió un musculo, esto no era lo que el entrenador esperaba así que hizo lo que se le da mejor – ¡Que demonios, es que no han escuchado , se mueven o les juro que no verán un descanso en las próximas 3 horas! – todos se movieron como por arte de magia esos descansos eran la gloria. Al terminar de dar la orden el entrenador se dirigió a Becky – Estaré esperando tu respuesta, piénsalo y sino crees que es el trabajo para ti ya pensaremos en algo, siempre tendrás un lugar en el equipo – con esto dio media vuelta hacia su oficina donde podía ver que Spike ya estaba por llegar. Maldición con todo el alboroto había olvidado la conversación con el entrenador, miro hacia el campo de entrenamiento y vio a Junior corriendo alrededor de este volteo un poco a su derecha y los chicos se preparaban para comenzar y descubrió que alguien la estaba observando y era una mirada tranquilizadora era Nubie, y ella solo asintió la cabeza solo para hacerle saber que estaba bien, después se dedico a largarse de ahí no era una cobarde pero había demasiadas cosas en cabeza como regresar a la cama por ejemplo. Ahora todo es mas complicado pensaba Becky no tenia ganas de ir a casa, sentía que su cabeza iba a explotar en cualquier momento, no podía dejar el equipo no ahora que Spike había vuelto eso solo la haría ver débil Argg maldito orgullo pero no podía evitarlo quien iba a decir que Spike regresaría,,,, Nooo esperen quien en su sano juicio pensaría que Spike regresaría en la gran encrucijada de su corta vida, algo malo debe haber hecho porque este karma le estaba pateando el trasero., pero había algo que la estaba inquietando no había contemplado el otro aspecto, si Becky volvía al equipo ya no seria como jugadora, los chicos del equipo se habían vuelto mas grandes y pesados, ella no era tan grande como ellos, este incidente fue solo un malentendido que tal si la próxima vez se rompía algo? Bueno no es como si eso no le hubiera pasado antes pero ella podía con ellos en esa época, estaban a la par., entonces se paro en seco así de repente por dios sintió como un puño directo a la boca del estomago y todo el aire saliendo por la nariz, era la primera vez que Becky O'Shea La Hielera, había pensado en ella misma como una chica que no podía jugar footbal Americano – Esto no esta bien – se dijo, después de esta revelación decidió ir con su psicólogo y entrenador personal y que por cierto no le cobraba nada su querido tío Kevin. Cuando llego con el tío Kevin, Becky se sintió mucho mejor salud a los empleados y se dirigió al único sitio donde sabia que el estaría, su oficina, es decir era como un santuario para el con todas esas fotografías de jugadores de football americano estrechando la mano del tío Kevin y premios que desfilaban por toda la pared –Hola tío Kevin – Becky entro y cuando dijo estas palabras el tío Kevin estaba al teléfono, este le hizo un gesto con la mano y ella se sentó a esperar que terminara la conversación - Si , ya lo se prometo que estaré ahí – solo se oía decir, Becky tenia una ligera idea de la persona del otro lado de la línea –Lo se cariño y suena delicioso, te veré esta noche – y eso lo redujo a una sola persona la tía Karen al parecer el tío Kevin estaba en problemas y era mejor que llegara a tiempo o dormiría en el sofá – Hola campeona hoy habrá buena cena en casa, me acompañas – le dijo con una sonrisa sincera en la cara – Claro me gusta cuando me usas de escudo con la tía Karen - Becky sabia que algo de eso debía estar ocurriendo – Claro que iré me gusta la comida de tía Karen y hace tiempo que no ceno con ustedes. Y con esto pasaron a la verdadera acción, Becky le conto todo con lujo de detalle, claro que el ya estaba enterado del incidente solo pregúntenle al entrenador Harrison sobre una posible renuncia repentina por un par de amenazas no tanto anónimas por parte del entrenador O'Shea, pero lo que si le sorprendió fue el regreso de Spike y eso solo significaba una cosa problemas para su sobrina, el sabia el efecto que tenia sobre ella era como esperar que se encendiera un cerillo empapado de gasolina y Spike era la chispa en esta ecuación – Así que, dime que tengo que hacer y todo saldrá bien - Kevin O'Shea levanto la ceja derecha y solo se le quedo viendo – Becky así no es como funciona y tu lo sabes, no puedo tomar esa decisión por ti – maldita sea ahora se tenia que comportar como un tío decente, y además de su frustración tenia hambre – Muy bien , esta bien pero no puedo pensar con el estomago vacio o si ? – Kevin O'Shea miro hacia el reloj de su muñeca, eran las 6 :30 p.m ese día cerraría temprano, pasar tempo con su sobrina favorita lo ponía de buen humor – Esta bien ayúdame a cerrar el negocio y después cenaras una grandiosa comida, pero primero avísale a tu padre – después de haber dicho esto salió a informarles a sus empleados que era tiempo de cerrar, Becky se dirigió al teléfono y después de avisarle a su padre fue con el tío Kevin, lo ayudo a cerrar y los dos tomaron rumbo hacia la casa de Kevin O'Shea. Cuando llegaron la cena ya estaba servida y lista tía Karen los recibió y dio un gran abrazo a Becky, a Becky siempre le agrado su tía es mas la adoraba, después saludo a sus primas se dispusieron a comer en toda la cena jamás se comento del incidente de Becky con el entrenador Harrison eso tenia que agradecérselo a la tía Karen, después dela cena jugaron con un juego de mesa por un rato pero como todo lo bueno tiene que acabar era hora de regresar a casa, así que Becky se despidió de todos y se acerco a la puerta en ese momento tío Kevin se acerco – Becky, linda solo quiero decirte que no importa lo que decidas, te quiero y eres una O'Shea, los O'Shea somos guerreros y ahora dame un abrazo – lo que ella hizo en seguida oh dios gracias por el tío Kevin, se despidieron y Becky partió hacia casa. Por el camino Becky pensaba y mientras mas pensaba mas le dolía la cabeza, estaba tan confundida y enfrentémoslo asustada una gran parte de su vida el football americano se le estaba escapando de sus manos, era demasiado para su corta vida, así que se dirigió a la colina cherry necesitaba aire fresco. Cuando llego se sentó y respiro, cerro los ojos y volvió a respirar haaa eso se sentía bien y olía bien, olía a cigarrillo…. Un momento cigarrillo? El aire fresco huele a cigarrillo? fue entonces cuando se dio cuenta de que no estaba sola y abrió los ojos de golpe y poco a poco comenzó a mirar a su alrededor, maldita sea pensó, bueno cálmate y respira si es necesario pelearas con uñas y dientes, cuando se dio la vuelta fue ahí donde lo vio, era Spike inhalando y exhalando un cigarrillo que tenia entre sus dedos, estaba recargado en un árbol y la miraba muy fijamente – ¡Que demonios, que estas haciendo, casi me provocas un infarto ! – Oh no., no lo dijo maldición había gritado como una niñita asustada, porque no te callas Becky se dijo mentalmente, Spike solo hizo una mueca burlona con la boca y se dedico a su cigarrillo – Es tu culpa, es tarde y las porristas no deben estar solas – Inhalo un poco y continuo – Además que estas haciendo aquí, estas esperando a la nave nodriza? – esto es raro pensó Becky, usualmente los insultos de Spike eran mejor que eso, ella se levanto de donde estaba y lo miro se veía como decirlo, se veía tranquilo ahí fumando - ¿Que haces aquí Spike? Vienes a burlarte hazlo y veras que mis puños no han cambiado – Eso es hazlo enojar, pensó quería descargar un poco de frustración y que mejor con una colosal pelea con Spike Hammersmith –Para que regresaste? Te dejaron salir del reclusorio para maniáticos buenos para nada o simplemente se dieron cuenta que no valías la pena y te dejaron ir, ni siquiera eres bueno para un reclusorio, apuesto que tu padre debe estar muy orgulloso eres igual a el – Bueno eso debería servir quería que el se sintiera tan molesto y frustrado como ella y creo que lo logro, miro como los puños de Spike se cerraban y sus venas se saltaban, como su cara se ponía rojas y el cigarrillo de su boca se quebraba por la presión que hacia con sus labios – Mira porrista, no tengo porque darte explicaciones, no he venido a pelear, pero si quieres hacerlo veras que puedo derrumbarte en menos de 5 segundos, así que deja de darme buenas razones para que te patee el trasero - después de esto busco en sus bolsillos y procedió a prender un cigarrillo nuevo – Ahora vámonos – y se dio la media vuelta para comenzar a caminar, pero que le pasa ? no puede estar hablando en serio, hace un segundo querían molerse –Como que vámonos? Yo no voy a ninguna parte contigo – Spike solo la miro, sabia que esto no iba a ser fácil, nada que involucrara a Becky O'Shea era fácil, estaba cansado y tenia hambre, así que decidió hacerlo por las malas, fue directo hacia ella y antes que la Hielera pudiera decir o hacer algo este la levanto y la puso sobre sus hombros - ¡Que haces, bájame malnacido, bájame juro que te matare lo juro Spike! - y así duro todo el recorrido hasta que el se dio cuenta que ya podía bajarla y que cada quien fuera a su casa, claro que todo el tiempo Becky no dejo de golpear e insultar a Spike, cuando este la bajo el primer impulso de Becky fue golpearlo en la cara – Bien hecho, ahora quedara una marca en mi hermoso rostro – esta le miro con resentimiento – te mereces eso y mas – y cuando se disponía a darle otro mas, Spike tomo de su mano y en un rápido movimiento puso su mano atrás de su espalda, así que Becky quedo con su espalda en el pecho de el, trato de zafarse pero su agarre era muy fuerte y entonces Spike hizo algo que la dejo helada, este acerco su boca al oído de Becky – Espero que hayas disfrutado haberme golpeado porque no habrá una segunda vez - Becky podía sentir su respiración y el vaivén del pecho de Spike cada vez que respiraba , además la muñeca le estaba doliendo, y así como empezó este la soltó de repente, la muñeca le dolía pero no iba a hacer ningún gesto de dolor se rehusaba – Estúpido – Spike solo le regreso una mirada burlona, es mas se estaba divirtiendo con toda la situación – es hora de ir a casa – y dicho esto Spike comenzó a caminar hacia su destino – Hey hielera, te veré el lunes en el entrenamiento – esta solo lo miro – no me hagas arrepentirme de haber regresado, además es divertido fastidiarte – maldito Psicópata pensó Becky y cuando estaba a unos pasos de haber caminado se escucho – Por cierto, lindos pechos, se nota que han crecido – menos mal que era de noche porque Becky se puso roja hasta las orejas, maldito imbécil, Becky juro que se vengaría, pero en esos momentos debía ir a casa, era casi la media noche y ella necesitaba descansar al diablo Spike, ya tendría la oportunidad perfecta para vengarze.[Chapter 3] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 3 Eran las 7:00 A.M de la mañana el lunes siguiente y Becky O'Shea estaba tendida en su cama con los ojos bien abiertos y dirigidos hacia el techo, estaba despierta desde hace un buen rato pero no encontraba las fuerzas para empezar el día, el fin de semana la había dejado agotada. Después de lo ocurrido el sábado el domingo no fue mejor, Junior la acosaba constantemente y preguntaba sobre la platica con el entrenador Harrison, a lo que Becky le conto con lujo de detalle si no nunca lograría quitárselo de encima, cuando creyó que por fin iba a dejarla en paz entonces vino la conversación que quería evitar a toda costa Spike, Junior estaba furioso mas que furioso estaba indignado, solo se le escuchaba parlotear cosas como., como se atreve o si regresa al equipo el entrenador Harrison es un idiota incluso llego a decir que si Spike regresaba el se iría del equipo. Fue en uno de esos arranques cuando Danny O'Shea, el padre de Becky escucho de lo que estaban hablando o mas bien Junior gritando y se dio cuenta que Spike había regresado, maldita sea pensó Becky, desde ese momento todo el maldito día no dejaron de hablar de el, la única persona que se mantenía al margen de la conversación era Patty, Becky noto que estaba muy callada y pensativa e incluso preocupada? Si su padre no fuera tan cabeza hueca en esos temas, es decir en los temas de mujeres, se daría cuenta de lo pasa a su alrededor, Becky estimaba mucho a Patty y no la malinterpreten estaba feliz de que su padre hubiera encontrado a alguien, pero todavía le parecía asombroso que Patty se casara con el, su padre que era despistado, atolondrado y muy terco, de eso puede estar segura que era una cualidad O'Shea, el amor es ciego pero si su padre no se quitaba la venda podría sufrir una vez mas. Por fin encontró la fuerza necesaria para salir de la cama y se dispuso a tener el ritual de cada mañana, cuando bajo Junior no estaba de hecho nadie estaba, mejor pensó así estaré mas tranquila, desayuno y se dirigió a la escuela. Cuando llego decidió que después del almuerzo iría a hablar con el entrenador, después de todo tenia una hora libre, su primera clase era matemáticas, que fastidio pensó, no es que no fuera buena pero en verdad le desagradaban, lo único que hacían por ella era darle unos buenos dolores de cabeza, después tendría química y luego historia, el almuerzo y la esperada platica con el entrenador Harrison. Todo iba según el plan hasta la clase de historia que Becky tuvo que admitir una falla en este, uno llamado Spike y que este eligió el asiento que estaba atrás de ella para acomodarse – Bastardo- murmuro, no había olvidado el tema de sus pechos y al parecer tampoco el, pues cuando entro al salón de clases se permitió una mirada indiscreta a estos, a lo que Becky solo cerro los puños hasta que sus nudillos tomaron un color blanco, si Spike lo noto esto solo le hizo gracia, había encontrado un placer inimaginable cada vez que hacia rabiar a Becky y la verdad le encantaba su cara enojada, era tan fácil tener una reacción de ella, solo había que apretar los botones correctos, además se había percatado desde hace mucho tiempo que ella solo tenia ese tipo de reacciones hacia el y eso lo hizo sentir bien. Había notado que no era el único que tenia especial interés por ella o mas bien sobre esa parte de su anatomía, los demás chicos trataban de echarle un vistazo pero claro siendo mas discretos, no querían un buen derechazo por parte de La hielera, en realidad los entendía, Becky no era de la clase de chicas que usaba ropa reveladora, ella solía usar jeans, playeras o camisas y a pesar de eso esa área de su cuerpo resaltaba maravillosamente para el deleite de la población varonil de la escuela y aunque Spike disfrutaba de la vista, quería destrozar a cada un de los pervertidos que dirigían sus ojos hacia ella. Quien lo diría Spike Hammersmith teniendo ese tipo de pensamientos sobre una chica, y no cualquier chica Becky O'Shea, La hielera, Spike había tenido un montón de novias, chicas que se arrojaban a sus pies, pero ninguna duraba mas de un mes si duraban 3 meses era un record, comenzó a notar a Becky cuando tenían alrededor de 13 años, sus facciones cambiaron y que decir de su cuerpo obviamente, pero no importa cuanto ella cambiara seguía siendo la misma chica obsesionada con el football americano y la única persona que se ha enfrentado a el con tanta determinación en el campo de juego y siendo una chica dejo una gran impresión sobre el, así que cada novia que acumulaba a la lista, inconscientemente no era lo suficientemente buena. La clase continuo normal para los demás, pero no para cierta chica, que en esos momentos tenia una inmensa ira dentro de ella y tratando de controlarse para no perder los estribos, maldito descarado pensó cálmate, tranquila se decía mentalmente, de repente sintió un pequeño estirón en su cabello, Spike estaba tirando de el, que acaso tiene 5? De ninguna manera me volteo, si no al diablo con la clase y le parto la cara –ah vamos, vas a ignorarme después de la cálida bienvenida del sábado? – Spike solo observaba la parte de atrás de su cabeza esperando una reacción, como no sucedió nada decidió tratar – Sigues teniendo la mano igual de pesada para ser una porrista—entonces Becky se acordó del puñetazo y de lo rápido que fue al detener el segundo, maldito la próxima vez no seria tan suertudo, Spike pensando que ya había logrado su cometido y que aun estuviera enojada con lo del puñetazo y lo que siguió después de este decidió que era suficiente, Becky era testaruda y orgullosa y estaba seguro que se desquitaría tarde o temprano, además ya había logrado su cometido, molestarla. Cuando la clase termino Becky fue una de las primeras en salir del salón, estaba segura que si se quedaba mas tiempo seria acusada de homicidio en primer grado, así que se dirigió al gimnasio donde el equipo de Voleibol estaba entrenando, su amiga Anne Price estaba en el equipo… bueno por así decirlo, el único motivo por el que Anne se había unido era para quitarse a sus padres de encima. Verán los padres de Anne adoraban el deporte y desde muy pequeña ella y sus hermanos habían sido entrenados para que practicasen alguno e incluso alentaban a sus hijos a competir entre ellos, su madre había sido porrista y su padre nadador, ambos en sus años de universidad, para ellos no había mas satisfacción que ver a sus hijos ganando en el campo y como siempre hay una excepción a la regla ahí estaba Anne, a la que el deporte lo consideraba un fastidio, ella por supuesto prefería quedarse en su cuarto leyendo un buen libro y ser una magnifica científica loca como Becky la llamaba, ambas se conocieron en un proyecto de ciencias donde el profesor había designado los grupos, Becky noto que Anne era muy divertida y Anne noto que Becky era muy agradable, pronto se hicieron amigas. Y ahí estaba justo como Becky lo esperaba, Anne en los bancas con un libro de una novela o ciencia esperando a que todo eso terminase para poder ir a almorzar, Becky aun no entendía como es que no la habían echado del equipo, pero como ella sabia Anne Price tan buena chica y divertida, podía ser una peste si tenia que conseguir algo, esta solo jugaba 5 o 10 min en cada partido y aunque era buena solo era para dar gusto a sus padres, la entrenadora anuncio el fin de la practica y las chicas se dispusieron a retirarse, Anne guardo el libro y diviso a Becky esperándola para ir a almorzar – Como estuvo el entrenamiento? – le pregunto Becky con una sonrisa burlona en la cara – No tengo idea, pero he encontrado un articulo muy bueno sobre la fotosíntesis – Becky solo sonrió, sip así era su amiga. Cuando ocurrió el incidente con el entrenador Harrison, Anne fue la primera en acción, según se había enterado Becky, los dos chicos que la habían visto en las regaderas estaban alardeando con gran orgullo por toda la escuela, hasta que misteriosamente alguien coloco una mezcla de polvos pika pika y hiedra venenosa en los calzoncillos de estos, estaba segura que Junior debía tener su parte, pero todo el crédito se lo llevaba Anne, ya había aprendido que cuando esta se enojaba era mejor tener cuidado a las represarías, después de todo Anne tenia que cuidarse de 3 hermanos y una hermana demasiados competitivos. Cuando estuvieron sentadas y acomodadas Anne quería hacer la pregunta que le estaba carcomiendo desde hace toda la mañana, pero sabiendo como era de explosiva su amiga no encontraba el momento o la delicadeza para hacerlo, la maldición de Anne era ser demasiado curiosa así que solo se armo de valor y empezó – Y bien? Que vas a ser con respecto al football? Ya hablaste con el entrenador? – Becky solo alzo la ceja – Y tu como te enteraste de eso, no te he contado nada, por dios Anne eres una cotilla –Anne solo se encogió de hombros – Los hombres hablan también sabes? Y tienes al hermano mas cotilla del mundo, me lo encontré antes en la mañana y me pidió que hiciera todo lo que este a mi alcance para que entraras en razón y no dejaras el equipo y evidentemente también me conto lo que sucedió en el entrenamiento del sábado - en este punto Anne dejo de hablar y se dedico a su comida esperando una respuesta, ella sabia muy bien todo lo que había sucedido ese día, así que era de suponer que también supiera todo lo que paso con Spike, así que decidió que lo mas prudente era que su amiga abriera esa lata de gusanos, Becky solo rodo los ojos, era verdad Junior era un chismoso de primera, como Anne ya sabia la mayor parte decidió contarle lo que sucedió después del entrenamiento, Anne escuchaba todo muy atenta pero no fue hasta que llego a la parte de su encuentro con Spike en Cherry Hill, que abrió tanto los ojos que becky pensó que se le saldrían por completo y rodarían por el piso de la cafetería, Anne no era ninguna tonta, ni despistada como los demás, ya había visto algunos destalles que no cuadraban cuando se trataban de Becky y Spike, sobretodo por parte de Spike, pero eran tan sutiles que era natural que los demás lo confundieran con las ganas que Spike tenia de molestar a alguien y ese alguien siempre resultaba ser Becky, además el carácter de Becky solo lo alentaban. Anne siempre tuvo la ligera sospecha de que había algo mas, de vez en cuando notaba a Spike con su vista cobre su amiga o la manera que se comportaba cuando Becky estaba con otros chicos, personalmente a Anne no le desagradaba Spike, pero tampoco lo quería como amigo había algo en el que era oscuro, siempre que peleaba con Becky ella era ignorada así que ninguno de los dos nunca entablo una conversación. Había algo perturbarte y esos moretes y golpes que siempre traía solo la hacían querer alejarse, desde hace un tiempo Anne tenia una hipótesis y no le gustaba para nada el resultado de esta si se llegaba a comprobar, aunque eso explicaría muchas cosas. Cuando se dio cuenta la hora del almuerzo ya había terminado y Anne tuvo que quedarse con muchas preguntas sin respuestas, pero que sabia que pronto serian respondidas, ya sabia la decisión de su amiga sobre el football americano era obvio y tan típico de Becky, así que las dos se separaron Anne hacia su clase de física I que curiosamente Junior también tomaba ese semestre y Becky directo hacia la oficina del entrenador Harrison. Becky ya había notado cierto interés de Junior por su amiga, pero lo atribuyo a que Anne si podía sostener una conversación que no fuera de cabello, brillo labial, bronceado y maquillaje, por dios cuando Becky se entero que Junior había decidido tomar física I no podía parar de reírse, para lo que a el le concierne el football americano era su vida y en el tenia todas las esperanzas, puesto que esperaba que este le diera una pase hacia una beca universitaria, tal vez tomo esa clase para no parecer tan tonto pensó Becky, y así estuvo pensando hasta que llego al despacho del entrenador, toco dos veces seguidas y se escucho un adelante por parte del entrenador, este estaba firmando algunos papeles cuando levanto la vista y reparo en la persona que estaba en la habitación –oh Becky , no pensaba que te vería tan pronto, toma asiento - lo cual Becky hizo enseguida – Y dime, ya tomaste una decisión? - le pregunto este dejando de lado todo el papeleo, a lo que Becky contesto – Si, he decidido seguir en el equipo, es mi ultimo año y quiero vivirlo al máximo, ya que después de esto no creo que me tomen en serio para jugar football, así que aprovechare esta oportunidad – la cara del entrenador no era de sorpresa, pero si que era seria – además – agrego esta – estoy segura que perderían sin mis grandes habilidades, admítalo entrenador serian un asco – dijo todo esto con un tono de autosuficiencia y un gesto arrogante pero con una sonrisa juguetona en los labios, el entrenador al escuchar esto solo emitió una sonora carcajada – tienes mucha razón hielera, pero esta vez seremos mas cuidadosos en las duchas – a la mención de esto Becky solo se rio y se sonrojo – Pero una cosa si O'Shea, si percibo que no puedes con la situación en el campo de juego no dudare en sacarte y te sacare a rastras si es que tengo que hacerlo – el entrenador tenia una mirada penetrante y esperaba que Becky accediera – De acuerdo, pero no espere milagros - bien pensó el entrenador, es mejor que nada esa chica era demasiado testaruda – Ahora fuera de mi oficina y nos vemos en la practica a las 3:00 p.m en punto, fuera – y con esto regreso al papeleo. El resto del día paso sin mas complicaciones para Becky, no esperaba el momento de volver al campo estos últimos 10 días sin pisar el pasto o sentir el balón de cuero en sus manos habían hecho estragos en ella, sentía ansias y emoción, además quería ver como reaccionaba el equipo. Cuando llego la hora Becky se dirigió a cambiarse, sabia que el equipo ya estaba en el campo así que se apresuro a colocarse la protección, al salir todos estaban sorprendidos; incluso Junior pero después corrieron a recibirla y a darle la bienvenida, el único que no parecía sorprendido era Spike que también había vuelto al equipo, y solo tenia una sonrisa de complacencia en el rostro, cuando Becky volteo se encontraron cara a cara y este le devolvió una mirada retadora, muy bien pensó Spike, La hielera ha vuelto.[Chapter 4] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 4 Ya había pasado un mes del incidente y la vida en Urbania seguía como siempre, todo funcionaba como un reloj suizo preciso y puntual, para Becky era lo que mas le reconfortaba de Urbania, el hecho de que siempre sabes que esperar cuando sales de casa y vez pasar al cartero, saludas a la pareja de abuelos tomando un paseo con sus queridos perros o vez a la vecina en su caminata diaria y a tu pervertido hermano fingiendo arreglar el jardín de enfrente con tal de dar una mirada a la preciosa chica, como dijera cierto chico rubio fisgón. En verdad a Becky le agradaban esos tiempos y los quería de vuelta por todos los cielos, solo el saber que todo regresaría a la normalidad la calmaba, pero no todo funciona como lo esperamos, ya había regresado al equipo desde hace un mes que había vuelto a entrenar con ellos, y estaba encantada, hasta que se dio cuenta que no iba a ser tan fácil, los muchachos del equipo no la dejaban ni a sol ni a sombra, evitaban a toda costa tocarla demasiado en los entrenamientos y era difícil que alguno de ellos le lanzara un pase, el entrenador tampoco ayudaba incluso a veces la sacaba del juego con la excusa de que necesitaba información de sus jugadores y ya que ella los conocía a todos ese resulto ser su trabajo, pero en el momento que esta intentaba rehusarse, este solo le miraba y le recordaba el trato que habían hecho y el maldito de Junior le secundaba, Becky estaba frustrada tanto trabajo para que la dejaran entrar al equipo y probar que era buena todo a la basura. Fue en uno de esos juegos de práctica cuando el entrenador le pidió que saliera, así que lo hizo a regañadientes, se sentó en las bancas con ganas de querer estrangular a la primera persona que se encontrara, después de un momento se dio cuenta de que alguien se sentaba junto a ella, giro la cabeza y era Nubie – Hola- le dijo dijo este acomodando sus lentes - No pareces muy feliz últimamente, soy tan mala compañía?- Nubie sabia lo que la mantenía de mal humor, así que debía aligerar el ambiente un poco, Becky solo rodo los ojos y bufo - lo único que hago últimamente es correr como gallina sin cabeza por toda la cancha y no te ofendas pero eso de tomar datos no es lo mío - Nubie solo miraba hacia el campo de practica con una pequeña sonrisa – Sabes? Solo lo hacen porque están preocupados, temen que si pasa otro incidente te iras – esta fijo la vista hacia donde el lo hacia y Nubie solo esperaba su reacción – ¡Al diablo con eso! –y ahí esta pensó Nubie –Lo único que quiero es jugar no les estoy pidiendo que me protejan y aunque lo intenten no pueden protegerme de todo – Nubie solo la observaba, al parecer estaba demasiado frustrada - Además, soy tan buena o mas bien mejor que la mitad del equipo – en esos momento Nubie le miro – Becky, eso ya lo sabemos la pregunta es ¿que esperas para recordárselos? -. A lo lejos Spike solo veía a la hielera y al chico con lentes entablando una por lo que veía muy interesante conversación, de vez en cuando Becky se exaltaba y pasaba sus manos sobre su rostro, estaba frustrada eso era obvio y tenia una muy buena razón de estarlo, todos los del equipo la trataban como si tuviera la peste, por dios lo que un par de melones podía hacer en los hombres, todos trataban de no hacerla sentir incomoda y el principal era el entrenador Spike estaba seguro que todo este lio era por el ayudado por supuesto por su entrometido hermano. Spike no había estado molestado a Becky últimamente, raro pero cierto la chica necesitaba un respiro y si este comenzaba una pelea, estaba seguro que no saldría bien parado, además Spike tenia sus propios problemas su oficial de libertad condicional lo visitaría muy pronto, así que eso lo mantenía lo suficientemente ocupado en esos momentos para hacer que la pocilga donde vive se vea un lugar decente entre otras cosas. De repente pudo ver como Becky se paraba de su lugar e iba directo hacia el entrenador, hablo con el durante unos minutos y este se veía algo renuente, pero al final accedió a lo que creía el dejar regresar a la chica al campo de juego, puesto que esta ya había emprendido camino hacia ellos con una mirada a lo que Spike pudo ver muy determinada, esto se va a poner interesante pensó. Este tomo su lugar cuando todo el equipo ya lo había hecho, la hielera estaba decidida no cabía duda, cuando el entrenamiento comenzó Becky fue directo hacia el balón e hizo lo que se le da mejor jugar como nunca, así que comenzó a tacklear, tirar y pasar a los demás, Johnson recibiría el balón en esa jugada y aunque era uno de su equipo esta se interpuso y robo el pase, cuando lo tuvo en sus manos corrió como nunca a la zona de anotación en donde Spike la recibió con un golpe en el flanco derecho y esta cayo, no sin antes haber estirado la mano lo suficiente para lograr una anotación. Todo lo que Becky podía ver en esos momentos era el balón en la zona de anotación y fue como una carga de energía del suelo hacia ella recorriéndole todo el cuerpo y haciendo que esta se levantara de un golpe con la cara llena de satisfacción, volteo hacia los demás y lo primero que vio fue a Spike a su lado sonriéndole, no era una sonrisa de oreja a oreja era pequeñita casi como una mueca y tal vez por la emoción del momento pero a Becky le pareció agradable -¡ O'Shea, pero que demonios! – el entrenador estaba furioso y tenia algo que decir oh claro que si -Que paso aquí? Se supone que Johnson recibiría el pase y tu solo bloquearías a Stan, darás 10 vueltas a la cancha- y antes que el entrenador pudiera añadir mas Becky decidió que ya era suficiente – Lo hice porque puedo hacerlo, o es que se le ha olvidado lo buena que soy? No te ofendas Johnson pero fue como quitarle un dulce a un bebe y si tengo que seguir robando pases para recordarle a usted y a cada uno del equipo que soy así de buena, tendrá que hacer una lista muy larga de castigos – este solo la miraba y Becky viendo que no decía nada decidió continuar – No me han dejado jugar de la manera que debería, usted y el equipo están fuera de control - ¿Nosotros? Tu eres la que se esta robando pases de su propio equipo, jovencita- ahora la hielera estaba comenzando a molestarse – Eso nunca fue un problema, escuche si no deja de ser una nena y me no me deja jugar no ganaremos el partido de la próxima semana, no es justo nunca antes fui tratada diferente ¿porque comenzar ahora? – en este punto el entrenador paso su mano por su cabello un gesto de frustración y suspiro, todos estaban atentos al intercambio de palabras entre los dos – tienes razón, y como eres como cualquier jugador, 20 vueltas a la cancha y después limpiaras los vestidores – se dirigió hacia los demás – y esto va para todos somos un equipo y nadie será tratado diferente, ahora muevan sus traseros esto ya se acabo oh espera O'Shea una cosa mas estarás en la banca el próximo partido, eso es por llamar a tu entrenador nena, ahora afuera de mi cancha. Becky solo pudo atinar a estar muy quieta y con los ojos bien abiertos, como que en la banca? Pensó con horror y en el momento que iba a expresar su indignación el entrenador se dirigió a ella – Sera mejor que comiences con esas vueltas, los vestidores no están muy bien que digamos y hace un buen rato que el conserje dejo de pasar por ahí - le dijo de forma burlona a lo que nuestra hielera tuvo que morderse la mejilla por dentro para empezar a maldecir su suerte y comenzar a correr. Cuando llego con lo chicos todos estaban limpios y listos para ir a casa, al ingresar a los vestidores muchos de ellos le miraron con lastima y hasta algunos le expresaron el pésame, cuando por fin se quedo sola mira a su alrededor, con razón los chicos la miraron de esa manera, toallas húmedas por doquier, un olor desagradable que no sabia muy bien de donde provenía y tampoco lo quería averiguar y al fondo un sesto lleno de suspensorios maldita se ella y su gran boca. Cuando llego a casa estaba cansada y furiosa, el entrenador la había mandado a la banca para el próximo partido, no era justo, fue directo al baño y se metió en la regadera sentía que el maldito olor de los vestidores estaba impregnado en su piel, cuando termino se dirigió a su cuarto a cambiarse y en el momento que entro en el, ahí estaba Junior tendido en su cama leyendo una revista y por lo visto muy cómodo -¿¡Qué demonios haces en mi habitación Junior¡? - la chica solo pudo apretarse mas contra la toalla que tenia puesta – Maldición Becky ponte algo de ropa – el rubio se levanto de la cama y salió corriendo hacia la puerta, y Becky se aseguro de ponerle el seguro a su salida, maldito fisgón que demonios hace un su cuarto. Después de un rato y ella con ropa se escucho unos golpes en la puerta - ¿Qué¡? – pregunto la chica que al mismo tiempo estaba en la tarea de secarse el cabello – Soy yo Junior, déjame entrar necesito hablar contigo es sobre el entrenamiento – por todos los cielos pensó Becky no toleraría otro sermón – Vamos abre la puerta sabes que puedo estar aquí toda la noche si es necesario, entonces tu padre se dará cuenta y obvio preguntara que esta pasando y naturalmente tendría que explicarle lo que esta sucediendo con su única hija - arggg como quería matarlo, si la situación era complicada añadirle un padre como Danny O'Shea no era buena idea, así que se levanto y quito el seguro de la puerta y dejo pasar al torturador Junior solo entro con una sonrisa y enseguida se acomodo en la cama de la chica, esta solo se le quedo viendo, esperando lo que podría decirle – Y bien? Que es lo que querías decirme?- Junior la miro y solo empezó – Beks lo que hiciste hoy no estuvo bien, que hubiera pasado si Johnson, hubiera ido con mas velocidad? – Becky solo rodo los ojos, aquí vamos pensó – Junior no empieces no estoy de humor el entrenador ya me veto del primer partido de la temporada además acabo de limpiar sus cochinadas, los hombres son unos cerdos- dijo todo esto mientras continuaba con su tarea de secar su cabello, este solo la miro ceñudo – tu te lo buscaste, mira que decirle al entrenador nena requiere de muchas bolas- esta solo le miro y le respondió con una sonrisa – bolas que al parecer ninguno de ustedes tiene, que era eso de no dejarme jugar y tratarme como una taza de porcelana? – Junior solo dio un sonoro suspiro –todos pensamos que era lo mejor, con eso que paso en las regaderas, no sabíamos como actuar así que pensamos darte un poco de espacio, y de todos modos ese maldito de Spike – y antes de que pudiera agregar algo mas Becky tuvo que intervenir- Junior, alto ahí puede que Spike no se mi persona favorita, pero fue el único que no me trato diferente y eso se lo agradezco ( y jamás se va a enterar de eso ) y aunque el golpe haya dolido se sintió muy bien no lo cambiaria por nada del mundo – Junior solo le miraba – Además quiero que entiendas una cosa pequeño entrometido, es que si hay algo que yo se hacer muy bien es jugar Football americano, así que déjame jugar y consíguete una vida – en este punto Becky lo miraba fijamente a los ojos con una expresión tranquila no amenazadora pero si muy segura de que cada palabra que salió de su boca – De acuerdo hablare con el equipo- Becky solo le miro con la ceja derecha levantada, así de rápido se iba a rendir? – No me mires de esa forma que quieres que diga, es mejor trabajar juntos y además si vas a seguir robando pases entonces nosotros tendremos que cuidarnos las espaldas – platicaron de otras cosas por una hora mas hasta que Becky expreso su deseo de dormir echando a Junior de su habitación. La semana había pasado rápido, al menos para cierta chica que había estado de mal humor, ni siquiera Anne podía estar cerca de ella y que decir del resto del mundo, no había quien quisiera estar a menos de 3 km a la redonda de ella, ya había desistido de hablar con el entrenador respecto al partido, digamos que cada vez que habría la boca un nuevo castigo se sumaba a la lista, incluso el tío Kevin trato de intervenir por supuesto era su sobrina favorita de quien estábamos hablando, pero después de escuchar al entrenador Harrison decidió que no movería un dedo, maldita sea era algo así del código del jugador jamás insultes a tu entrenador, según el tío Kevin ella tenia suerte de estar todavía en el equipo. Así que el viernes llego trayendo también el esperado partido contra los chicos de Enid de la preparatoria Roosevelt, y Becky solo podía aspirar a sentarse en la banca, ese día había empezado a llover a medio día y no había parado hasta la tarde justo una hora antes del partido. En todo el partido Becky no había dejado de sufrir, era una tortura ver como anotaban y tackleaban a su equipo. Enid estaba 10 puntos arriba de Urbania y eran los últimos 20 minutos del partido, al parecer Junior y Spike no habían dejado sus problemas afuera de la cancha, fue necesaria la intervención del entrenador o mas bien amenazas que fue lo que mas le pareció a Becky y algunas de las viejas jugadas por parte de Nubie para que Urbania pudiera estar a la par con Enid y un touchdown por parte de Spike para ganar el partido. Después del partido como es de costumbre, habría una fiesta por la victoria o alguna reunión por la derrota, pero siempre con la presencia de la inigualable cerveza y claro la fiesta seria en un lugar donde la preciada bebida no pudiera ser removida como por ejemplo padres o algún que otro policía, así que esta tomo lugar en el lago de Urbania. Cuando Becky llego todo el mundo ya estaba ahí, miro a su alrededor para encontrar a alguien conocido y los diviso eran Anne y Nubie que estaban platicando con otros chicos del equipo cerca de los botes que había alrededor de la orilla del algo, a Becky siempre le sorprendió lo bien que Nubie se llevaba con todo el mundo – Hola, perdón por legar tarde pero el entrenado me hizo barrer los vestidores – Nubie la miro un poco sorprendido – Solo eso? Has estado limpiando de arriba hacia abajo incluso se puede comer en los inodoros – Anne solo se rio, la pobre había estado haciendo la limpieza de los vestidores toda la semana – Creo que me tuvo un poco de lastima o estaba de muy buen humor o fueron ambas cosas – Lo dijo mientras observaba la fiesta y los demás solo rieron, así continuaron conversando – Tengo sed voy por algo de beber - Anne en verdad se mostraba sedienta o como bien sabia Becky era para monitorear algún chico lindo – Voy contigo – dijo la hielera, no había visto a Junior y tenia curiosidad de ver lo que estaba haciendo que para estas alturas ya debería estar ebrio, se dirigieron al área de bebidas y tomar una cerveza cada una y después decidieron hacer un recorrido por la fiesta, la música era alta, y había autos estacionados alrededor de una porción del lago, una fogata y muchos chicos ebrios tratando de conquistar a alguna chica ebria y algunos mas bailando alrededor de ellos, típica fiesta de adolecentes , las muchachas terminaron sus bebidas y fueron por otra mas, que mas da pensó Becky es viernes y acababan de ganar un partido, además se lo merecía después de haber pasado una semana de infierno , sabia que el entrenador pronto tendría que volver a incluirla en el campo apenas era el comienzo de la temporada. Estuvieron un rato platicando con cualquier persona que les hablara y decidieron ir a sentarse en el muelle y fue ahí donde la búsqueda de Becky dio frutos y por dios que recompensa, ahí estaba Junior sin playera y con un sostén en la cabeza, jugando algo que ella desconocía pero estaba segura que era algo así como vamos haber quien se embriaga primero, haaaaa era bueno ver a Junior ebrio siempre le sacaba una sonrisa – Que clase tiene tu hermano, aunque ese sostén no es para su tono de piel- las dos muchachas empezaron a reír, no sabían si era por el alcohol o por el espectáculo de que era Junior, Becky decidió que era un poco de los dos. Estuvieron viendo y riéndose de Junior un rato cuando un chico castaño de linda sonrisa invito a Anne a bailar, esta se giro hacia Becky no quería dejarla sola pero esta le aseguro que estaba bien – Además es lindo- y le guiño un ojo Anne estaba un poco mas tranquila, después de ver un poco mas a Junior Becky decidió echar otro vistazo y esperar a Anne, después decidirían que hacer, se dirigió por otra cerveza y decidió que esperaría a su amiga recargada en uno de los arboles que había alrededor del lago, de repente escucho unas risas que venían de atrás de ella en dirección a los arboles, en un momento una rubia con tetas enormes salió., era Sandra si mal no recordaba, ella y Junior la habían traumado, por la manera que caminaba o mas bien se tambaleaba, Becky decidió que ya había tomado algunas cervezas y así la vio alejarse no quería hacerse cargo de una ebria, tenia el presentimiento que ella tendría que hacerse cargo de Junior y tal vez de Anne – Vaya es la primera vez que te veo con una cerveza en la mano porrista – maldito karma pensó Becky, que había echo ella, volteo un poco la cabeza y lo vio , estaba ahí parado con las manos en sus bolsillos – Debí haberlo imaginado cuando vi a la pelos pintados, son tal para cual, será mejor que no te me acerques podrías contagiarme de algo - Spike solo la miro, y dedujo que el alcohol estaba haciendo efecto en Becky así que tentó a su suerte y este se acerco mas a ella acorralándola contra el árbol dejando un muy pequeño espacio entre ellos , Becky no se dio cuenta cuando este la había guiado a lo mas oscuro de la parte del árbol donde las hojas son mas densas, es mas se dio cuenta demasiado tarde maldita cerveza pensó –Te aseguro que estoy muy limpio, jamás he tenido un queja y si quieres puedo demostrártelo – algo estaba pasando ahí al parecer Spike también había estado tomando unas cuantos cervezas, Becky reacciono y lo empujo tenia que salir de ahí, no estaba tan ebria aun tenia un poco de conciencia verdad? Miro a Spike una vez mas, este solo le devolvía una media sonrisa, se veía muy bien con el reflejo de las luces que entraban por las hojas, bajo su mirada y se fijo en sus labios, poco tiempo tuvo en reflexionar lo que había pensado, en esos momento se escuchaban las sirenas de la policía que al parecer habían irrumpido en la fiesta, todos los que estaban en la fiesta empezaron a dispersarse como ratas – Vamos , corre – era Spike que había tomado de su mano y había comenzado a moverse en dirección contraria a la fiesta, Becky solo se movió en automático ni siquiera presto atención a las gotas de lluvia que empezaban a caer, solo sentía la mano de Spike y sus dedos entrelazados con los de ella, esto no esta bien pensó y siguieron corriendo.[Chapter 5] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 5 Becky no sabia muy bien lo que estaba pasando o mas bien no tenia ni la mas mínima idea de cómo es que llego desde el lago hacia la casa de Spike y ciertamente no le interesaba en esos precisos momentos ya tendría tiempo de lamentarse y no es que no le interesara si no que en esos momentos solo se dedicaba a sentir los labios de Spike sobre los suyos, las manos de el curiosas por su anatomía que suben y bajan ansiosas por la parte baja de su espalda, así que nop a Becky no le interesaba para nada como habían terminado en el lugar de Spike y para ser honestos le importaba una mierda, nada le importaba en esos momentos la policía, su padre, el entrenador, Anne que seguro estaría furiosa tratando de idear una coartada para su amiga, incluso no le importaba que la persona con la que estuviera haciendo esas cosas fuera Spike Hammersmith, su enemigo no esperen su archienemigo por todos los santos! Y mientras sentía todo lo que estaban haciendo su cerebro trataba de racionalizarlo todo estaba bien le decía, mientras no sienta mariposas en el estomago como había escuchado decir a su prima alguna vez todo estaría bien y fuera de peligro, era lo que se decía una y otra vez tratando de justificar tales besos y manos largas, pero todos sus esfuerzos se fueron a la borda en el momento que Spike pidió permiso para profundizar el beso usando su lengua para tratar de entrar a su boca y ella se lo concedió embriagada con la agradable sensación, en el momento que el chico inicio el juego Becky sintió mariposas, abejas hasta una maldita bandada de pájaros en su estomago, la sensación de aquel beso era lo mas maravilloso que había sentido en toda su vida, había besado antes pero no con tanta pasión o fuera lo que fuera que estuviera pasado, Spike era hábil su lengua jugaba con la de Becky nunca perdiendo el control y siempre llevando el ritmo que era frenético y excitante, el muy maldito era bueno en lo que hacia, sus manos por otra parte estaban ocupadas dibujando pequeños círculos en su cadera desnuda ya que había removido un poco la tela que cubría esa área, Becky no pudo soportarlo mas entre lo besos soltó un gemido de placer y esto la sorprendió tanto que abrió los ojos de par en par acabando de repente con el beso , Spike respingo un poco pero no tanto puesto que continuaba con las caricias, tenia un presentimiento de lo que acaba de pasar, Becky por otra parte estaba pensando en lo que había pasado, acaso ella había echo ese sonido? y Spike no iba decir nada al respecto o tratar de burlarse? al parecer no puesto que aun sentía las caricias que este le proporcionaba y gimió por segunda vez maldito lo hace apropósito y como si este le leyera lamente solo sonrió, una sonrisa lasciva y seductora, debía ser el alcohol porque en esos momentos Becky no quería hacer otra cosa mas que besar a Spike así que lo hizo y este respondió gustoso quien lo diría la Hielera era puro fuego y el estaba decidido a quemarse, así que aprovecho para guiarlos a ambos hacia su habitación y ubicar la cama y cuando lo hizo se aseguro de que Becky estuviera de espaldas a esta para así poder darle un empujón haciendo que esta cayera de espaldas, eso solo hizo que Becky se sorprendiera y por un momento la indignación apareció en su rostro es decir la había arrojado como costal de papas o algo así y cuando iba a darle a Spike un poco de su indignación con una serie de insultos acomodados a la situación este se acomodo sobre ella y comenzó a besar su cuello y nuestra hielera automáticamente cerro los ojos y fue como si sus manos cobraran vida pasando por el cabello hacia la espalda del chico y poco a poco comenzó a retirar la camisa de este, Spike solo retrocedió un poco para ayudarla en su tarea y regreso al ataque hacia su cuello, quería saborearla y satisfaciendo su lado mas oscuro quería marcarla y dejarle un gran morete era una gran idea todo el mundo lo vería y el se sentiría orgulloso y logrado su cometido se dirigió mas abajo era el turno de Becky de deshacerse de esta molesta prenda y quedar en iguales condiciones, maldición pensó Spike cuando por fin la camisa fue olvidada y ella solo estaba cubierta por sus sostén, ni en sus sueños mas locos abría imaginado esta situación, bueno en sus sueños mas pervertidos claro que si a quien quería engañar, pero lo mas sorprendente es que Becky todavía no lo hubiera asesinado, estaba seguro que cuando la había besado por primera vez hace unos momentos este tendría un ojo morado que mostrar al día siguiente y para ser honestos aun no sabia porque lo había echo pero un cosa si era segura lo aprovecharía al máximo. Dudaba mucho de que ella no fuera virgen, es decir todos los chicos le temían y si alguien hubiera tratado de hacer lo que el estaba haciendo en estos momentos todo el equipo de football ya hubiera destrozado al pobre infeliz que se atreviera, así que en esos momentos se deleitaba viendo sus pechos y comenzó a besarla y a poner sus brazos alrededor ella, Becky sentía las manos de Spike en su espalda mientras que su boca hacia maravillas con el lóbulo de su oreja, Spike iba por un punto en particular de su espalda o mas bien de la prenda que la chica aun llevaba puesta y que se interponía con sus necesidades el maldito sostén, era toda una maniobra tratar de desabrocharlo, tantas experiencias como esta y en cada una el maldito pedazo de tela se resistía, al fin el broche cedió y poco a poco fue retirando las tiras de cada uno de sus hombros, Becky solamente estaba decidida a sentir y de pronto se dio cuenta que el sostén estaba mas flojo y sus hombros siendo liberados ¡ por dioos esto estaba llegando muy lejos has algo Becky! Esto era lo que una vocecilla gritaba en su cerebro y Becky simplemente decidía ignorarla campalmente cada vez que la escuchaba, Spike se quedo maravillado ya había retirado la prenda esos senos eran la gloria, los toco eran suaves, maravillosos eran grandes sin pasar a la exageración, definitivamente eran perfectos, comenzó a masajearlos y al instante Becky se arqueo tan deliciosamente que le dio mayor libertad en el acto, los sonidos que Becky hacia con su boca solo ayudaban que su gran erección creciera mas, cada gemido era una tortura para el quería tomarla ahí mismo, quitarle el pantalón ponerla en posición y sentir el extremo placer, escucharla gritar su nombre e implorar por mas, quería estar adentro de ella una y otra vez toda la noche y explorarla de arriba hacia bajo en todas las posiciones por dios estaba demasiado caliente, una de las manos del chico se dirigió hacia el sur mientras que la otra atacaba un seno, su boca fue hacia el otro recién liberado y este lamio, succiono y sintió como sus pezones comenzaban a endurecerse, Becky no podía mas estaba en el paraíso sentía su cuerpo caliente y la cabeza nublada de tanto placer. La boca de Spike se movía tan placenteramente sobre su seno y su lengua hacia maravillas en el pezón rodeándolo, succionando, mordiendo suavemente, lo único que la chica podía hacer era sujetarse del cabello de Spike halaba de el y lo masajeaba mientras que Spike seguía con su labor. De repente Becky sintió la mano de Spike en el broche de su pantalón, tan concentrada estaba en las sensaciones que el chico le estaba proporcionando que no se había dado cuenta de la mano de Spike, el muy resbaloso había encontrado camino hacia su pantalón y lo más sorprendente es que lo había desabotonado eso es tener habilidad pensó Becky , trato de retirarlos del cuerpo de la chica pero no era tarea para una sola mano y se resistía a la sola idea de pensar que su otra mano dejaría su labor actual, labor que estaba disfrutando al máximo, así que encontró el inicio a su ropa intima y Becky movió las caderas hacia el, sintiendo la erección de este y sacando un gruñido de placer por parte del chico, el roce fue demasiado para Spike estaba al máximo y muy ansioso mas de lo que el hubiera esperado, al escuchar el gruñido de Spike y sentir la gran protuberancia de repente, Becky se dio cuenta de la que estaba a punto de pasar fue como un golpe de realidad y su cerebro gustoso se lo recordó con un TE LO DIJE, su cuerpo se tenso instantáneamente no solo se estaba toqueteando y besando con un chico se estaba toqueteando y besando con Spike Hammersmith, mierda tenia que hacer algo y rápido – Spike- trato de decir y al mismo tiempo tratando de alejarse un poco, pero este no la dejo continuar puesto que la había interrumpido con un beso y Becky automáticamente se perdió en el, era como el anterior pero este estaba lleno de deseo y de lujuria. Cuando Spike escucho su nombre por parte de la chica sabia que Becky se echaría para atrás y eso no lo permitiría al fin la tenia a su disposición y ella no se libraría tan fácilmente, así que aprovecho el beso para introducir uno de sus dedos buscando el botón de placer y al parecer su búsqueda rindió frutos puesto que Becky había echado la cabeza hacia atrás haciendo un sonido que a Spike le pareció tan endemoniadamente sexy, se veía tan sensual en esos momentos su boca roja e hinchada por los besos y sus ojos entre abiertos con lujuria y placer y que el estaba provocando y que sabia muy ben que ella estaba disfrutando , puesto que la humedad que salía de ella era demasiada su ropa interior comenzaba a mojarse – haaaa Spike detente – solo pudo decir entre gemidos y sonidos de placer que salían de su boca, los puños de la chica estaban cerrados y sujetos con fuerza a la sabana debido a la sensación de vértigo, Spike solo sonrió esa sonrisa de lado que Becky tanto odiaba y que estaba empezando a gustarle, este decidió no solo a hacerle caso si no que introdujo in dedo en ella y aumento la velocidad de sus caricias, Becky estaba que explotaba movía sus caderas inconscientemente y daba gritos de placer que llenaban toda la habitación, el ritmo de Spike era frenético no sabia si podía aguantar por mas tiempo era delicioso, pero no le daría la satisfacción al maldito bastardo ella todavía estaba en el juego y lo demostró dándole una sonrisa arrogante, pero todo se fue a la borda cuando este acerco sus labios al oído de la muchacha y en una voz muy grave una que nunca había escuchado por parte de Spike le susurro o mas bien ordeno – Vamos – le dijo este mordiendo su oreja – córrete, córrete para mi, quiero ver como es ese lindo rostro retorcido en placer – Becky no tenia salvación, escucharlo hablar de esa forma maldición era una pervertida después de todo, sintió que su cuerpo se tensaba y una corriente eléctrica recorría todo su cuerpo y el centro de este era el punto exacto donde la mano de Spike estaba haciendo maravillas. La hielera dio un grito que termino en pequeños gemidos de satisfacción, su cuerpo comenzó a relajarse y los parpados comenzaron a pesarle en cansancio después del ejercicio realizado, ni en los mas duros entrenamientos llegaba tan cansada a casa y de repente sintió los labios de Spike sobre los suyos, el beso era calmado y suave, Spike se tomo su tiempo sabia que ese había sido el primer orgasmo de la chica y no quería parecer un bruto al que solo le interesaban sus necesidades, pero al parecer sus necesidades tendrían que esperan puesto que Becky comenzaba a cerrar sus ojos sucumbiendo al cansancio , maldición pensó el ahí duro como una piedra, debería haber ido con mas calma, pero era imposible la hielera tiene un cuerpo que mata y sus reacciones hacia el eran calientes, embriagantes e invitantes, en esos momentos se contuvo de pensar en eso puesto que su erección estaba reaccionando y sus bolas comenzaban a dolerle, al parecer tendría que recurrir al viejo truco de la mano. Así que se adentro al baño y comenzó a tocarse, primero la punta disfrutando de lo que acababa de presenciar y al recordarlo su excitación tomo control sobre el así que decidió tomarlo de la base y empezar con los movimientos de arriba hacia abajo que para un muchacho de su edad le es tan familiar, después de unos gemido y caricias placenteras que el mismo se proporciono termino y comenzó con el aseo personal. Se dirigió a la habitación donde Becky se encontraba pudo notar que tenia el pantalón a la mitad de sus muslos y en una posición no muy cómoda para dormir, así que Spike arriesgándose que en cualquier momento la chica despertara y al fin obtendría su ojo morado, le puso un suéter a modo de pijama, pero esta ni siquiera hizo movimiento ni sonido alguno, parecía que podía pasar una estampida de elefantes por la habitación y ella no se despertaría, la acomodo y arropo para que durmiera mejor era una noche fresca la lluvia ya había parado desde hace un buen rato y Spike estaba en un dilema, dormir en el sofá o en su propia cama , sabia que mañana se desataría una guerra campal, seguro Becky querría matarlo y ser lo primero que ella viera en la mañana le provocaría un infarto al miocardio, lo mas lógico en ese momento es que el tomara el sofá, el único problema es que a este no le apetecía para nada esa idea y se dirijo directo a la cama después de todo esta era su casa, su cuarto y su cama, este se acomodo junto a Becky y esta se había movido se encontraba frente a el, Spike se dio cuenta que su cabello todavía estaba sujeto en un cola baja, bueno todo despeinado con hilos de cabello por aquí y por allá, sabia que no debía hacerlo, pero Becky raramente dejaba su cabello suelto y a el le gustaba cuando lo hacia, cuando la vio por primera vez fue en el juego con ese horrible uniforme de porrista, el atuendo era horroroso y lo único bueno de esa visión era ver a la chica con su cabello castaño suelto y fue ahí cuando Spike decidió que le gustaban las castañas, así que aprovechando que la chica estaba dormida este retiro la liga del cabello y dejo que este cayera en la cama y en el hombro de ella, así esta mejor pensó, era preciosa su cabello castaño suelto le daba un toque casi angelical y digo casi porque tenia la pequeña impresión de que mañana en la mañana ese ser angelical se convertiría en demonio listo para arrancarle las nueces, con ese pensamiento decidió aprovechar la ocasión y rodeo a la chica con su brazo por la cintura acercándola mas a el y fue en ese momento en que Spike decidió que esta no seria la ultima vez que tendría a Becky la hielera O'Shea entre sus brazos de eso podía estar seguro. A la mañana siguiente Becky despertó con un poco de frio, la mañana estaba refrescando y era obvio que había llovido unas horas antes, así que solo se acurruco un poco mas en la cama y se aseguro de tapar todos los orificios de la manta que la cubría para que no entrara ninguna corriente de aire frio, sumida en su tarea y con los ojos aun cerrados pudo notar que algo irradiaba calor a su espalda y algo mas sintió algo en su estomago dirigió su vista hacia ese lugar y miro un brazo que la estaba sujetando, Becky solo abrió los ojos como platos y entonces comenzó a recordar Spike y su mano entrelazada con la de ella, Spike y ella en la casa de el, Spike y ella gritando por algo, Spike besándola, tocándola, desvistiéndola y ella sintiendo un gran orgasmo y cuando recordó esa parte el rostro de la chica parecía una lucecita roja navideña, asi que llego a la estúpida conclusión que la persona que estaba detrás de ella era Spike y poco a poco giro su rostro para encontrar a un dormido Spike muy cerca de su rostro y que al sentir los varios movimientos que ella había realizado apretó mas su brazo alrededor de ella, acercándolos aun mas si eso era posible, Becky solo atino a quedarse muy quieta mientras su mente trabajaba a mil por hora y su corazón se desbordaba de lo rápido que estaba latiendo ¡! Pero que demonios había echo ¡! Era lo único que podía pensar una y otra vez.[Chapter 6] PEQUEÑOS GIGANTES (LITTLE GIANTS) Capitulo 6 Pánico una palabra tan pequeña pero con un gran significado y demasiado mordaz y amenos que sean una de esas personas desdichadas que han experimentado este horroroso sentimiento, no podrán comprender lo que nuestra Hielera estaba experimentando en estos precisos momentos pánico puro y en su máximo esplendor, todo lo que sentía era mil veces de lo normal, el brazo de Spike alrededor de su cintura, su respiración pegándole directamente en la nuca esto era demasiado necesitaba largarse de ahí pero ya, tenia que moverse es mas debía moverse para propinarle unos buenos golpes al maldito desgraciado que la estaba sosteniendo, el rostro de Becky estaba tornándose color escarlata por la furia contenida contra Spike y admitámoslo un poco contra ella, como en los mil infiernos del averno dejo que llegaran a este punto, esperen un momento esto no era su culpa no podía ser su culpa ( la negación es la salvación de un borracho ) era culpa de la cerveza, eso es; el alcohol había echo todo esto, poniéndola en un estado vulnerable y el desgraciado de Spike se aprovecho de eso y con toda la furia que la muchacha sentía en esos momentos decidió darle un buen golpe en el estomago con su codo, Spike simplemente sintió como el aire salía de su boca y un dolor en el estomago acompañado de varios puñetazos, debió haberlo imaginado Becky ya había despertado, maldición la racha de golpes que estaba recibiendo no era la forma en la que quería despertar al parecer Becky estaba muy enojada, en esos instantes lo único que podía hacer fue tomar a Becky por los hombros y obligarla a recostarse en la cama de nuevo el sobre ella y las manos de el aprisionando las de la chica cada una a cada lado de su cabeza de esa manera la dejo inmovilizada, bueno casi porque esta se retorcía como un gusano, Becky forcejeaba, pateaba, gritaba pero todo intento de escapar era inútil, obviamente el era mas fuerte y grande que ella - Depravado, hijo de puta, maldito bastardo, estúpido, imbécil de mierda déjame ir! – Spike solo se dedicaba a observarla menuda forma de despertar, bien sabia que tenia que haber dormido en el sofá, la chica parecía un demonio hambriento y el era el desayuno, sabia muy bien que si no hacia algo sus vecinos llamarían a la policía por los gritos que la chica estaba dando y eso solo le causaría mas problemas con su oficial de libertad provisional – Quieres calmarte de una buena vez ¡! – le dijo a la histérica chica lo mas calmado que pudo, alguien debía mantener la calma y que ironía que fuera el – Calmarme ¿?! Estas loco déjame ir! Te romperé la cara si no lo haces te lo advierto Spike- maldición pensó el chico esto va tomar su tiempo, Becky era testadura y temperamental y no hay poder suficiente en este mundo para calmarla en estos momentos, así que Spike decidió aprovechar el momento se inclino y la beso, Becky se quedo quieta y con los ojos muy abiertos simplemente no se lo esperaba el alcohol debía estar en su sistema puesto que esta empezó a responder el beso, Spike soltó su agarre y comenzó a acariciarla instintivamente y poco a poco separándose un poco de ella le dijo con una sonrisilla de complacencia y extremadamente picara – Lo ves? Al parecer no soy el único pervertido aquí no lo crees?- Becky no se había dado cuenta del momento en que comenzó a besarle ni mucho menos cuando esta aprisiono la cintura de Spike con sus piernas – Imbécil – fue lo único que nuestra Hielera pudo decir, Spike solo soltó un bufido, grave error el lugar donde Becky le había proporcionado el golpe comenzó a dolerle - Maldición, tenias que haberme despertado de esa manera? Eres una salvaje – le dijo levantándose y tocándose el área dañada, dando a Becky la libertad tan ansiada y alejándose lo mas que podía de el – Como demonios esperabas que te levantara! Por dios Spike, después de lo de anoche eres un violador en potencia ¡! – esta le respondió ofendida, pero que esperaba un camino de rosas? – Oh no, no me echaras la culpa de esto solo a mi, creo que es mi deber informarte que lo que paso anoche lo disfrutaste tanto como yo, dijiste mi nombre tanta veces y te retorcías en placer hasta que explotaste, deja de jugar a la inocente, así que pequeña pervertida eres igual a mi y te aseguro que algún día pedirás por mas - . Este se acerco peligrosamente a Becky por un segundo beso, pero esta vez no seria tan fácil, había logrado enfurecerla una vez mas, esta mañana parecía una montaña rusa de emociones, ya casi lo tenia solo el debía acercarse un poco mas y caería en la trampa, cuando al fin lo tenia bastante cerca y creyendo que la chica respondería también a este beso como el anterior, la Hielera decidió darle un buen golpe, cabeza contra cabeza. Ahora ese golpe también tenia que haberle dolido a ella indudablemente, pero era tanta su rabia contenida que no le importaba sufrir con tal de verlo a el retorciéndose de dolor, Spike retrocedió instintivamente eso definitivamente lo dejo desubicado, pues bien mientras Spike lamentaba su suerte Becky se puso en acción bajo de la cama para descubrir que todo este tiempo tenia puesto un suéter que le llegaba a los muslos necesitaba su ropa y ya, encontró su ropa tirada por toda la habitación y se apresuro a entrar a lo que suponía que era el baño para cambiarse, nunca en su vida se había puesto la ropa tan rápido, cuando salió del baño no sin antes haber respirado varias veces para tranquilizarse y amortiguar el dolor de cabeza que estaba segura se convertiría en una horrible migraña, al salir vio a Spike sentado todavía en la cama y ambas manos en su cabeza y mentalmente se felicito por el golpe, el tío Kevin estaría muy orgulloso aunque para ser sinceros parecía que ella tenia un tambor adentro de su cabeza - Te vas sin despedirte? Que modales tan malos tienes porrista - maldición, es que no podía quedarse callado por una vez en su vida, estaba segura que lo hacia a propósito, cada vez que el hablaba era como despertar a la asesina que tenia dentro de ella, necesitaba largarse de ahí, todavía no había señal de alerta o sirenas por las calles de toda Urbania buscándola, tuvo el pequeño presentimiento que esto se lo debía a su querida amiga Anne – Ya tuve suficiente de ti y créeme que no quiero volver a ver tu asquerosa cara nunca mas, si fuera por mi te mandaría de regreso a patadas del lugar donde viniste –y con esas palabras salió de ese lugar lo mas rápido posible no quería otra conversación con Spike, eso solo haría que la cabeza le doliera mas y en este momento eso era un martirio. Después de todo el drama del fin de semana, los días que le siguieron pasaron lentos, en todos lados de la escuela se podía escuchar sobre la victoria del equipo de football y que la temporada seria pan comido, Becky solo quería que todos lo olvidaran, no la malentiendan estaba feliz de que su equipo hubiera ganado, pero eso era un constante recordatorio de lo que había sucedido después de ese juego, cuando llego a casa ese día se dio cuenta para su deleite que no había nadie, bueno al menos eso parecía, la casa estaba tranquila y no encontró a nadie hasta que paso por el cuarto de Junior, estaba tratando de dormir y tenia una horrible resaca, al parecer había escapado cuando llego la policía o mas bien arrastrado Anne y Nubie y otros chicos de equipo lo habían llevado a casa, cuando la madre de este les pregunto por Becky fue Nubie quien respondió dando una excusa muy convincente diciendo que estaba en casa de Anne y que estaba segura, claro que Anne estaba escondida detrás de los botes de basura si no todo el actito se habría echado abajo, así que Becky le debía a Nubie que ella ni hubiera sufrido el mismo destino que su querido hermano, Paty decidió que Junior debía aprender una lección respecto a llegar ebrio a la casa y que este debía pagar su falta a la sociedad, así que todo el fin de semana Junior hizo todas las tareas de la casa, el primer día fue horrible para el chico todavía sentía que el alcohol estaba en su sistema, la cabeza le daba vueltas además del dolor punzante que tenia y las nauseas que tenia que soportar cuando este se inclinaba a limpiar el inodoro que recibió mas de una vez su desayuno. Así es Paty no tuvo piedad con el y estaba completamente segura que no lo hubiera tenido la mas mínima compasión con ella. En resumen Becky tenia una gran deuda con el buen Nubie y también con Anne, en cuanto a la ultima Becky sabia que si debía evitar la furia de su amiga debía contarle todo con lujo de detalle, la chica estaba encantada, asombrada y horrorizada en la opinión de su amiga esto era mucho mejor que las novelas que solía leer y en cuanto a Spike en estos momento lo único que se le venia a la mente era ignorarlo, no podía enfrentarlo al menos no en esos momentos puesto que cada vez que lo veía volvía a recordar la escenita de la cama, soy una maldita pervertida, se decía (no quería admitir que en verdad lo había disfrutado), entonces pues cada ves que lo veía lo ignoraba en los pasillos, salones de clases incluso en las practicas de football. Para el transcurso de la segunda semana el entrenador Harrison le había dado luz verde ahora podía practicar con el equipo, mas sin embargo no le quito el castigo de limpiar las suciedades de sus queridos compañeros y a pesar de eso aun no volvería como jugadora, según el entrenador todavía no se ganaba ese privilegio, su humor era horrible pero al menos mas tolerable que semanas pasadas. Y de nuevo aquí estaba sola limpiando la suciedad de sus adorables compañeros, malditos cerdos pensaba la pobre chica que no podían ser un poco mas considerados con ella? A lo lejos se podían escuchar unos pasos no le presto mucha importancia debe ser el entrenador y esta volvió su tarea aun le faltaba trabajo por hacer y quería ir a casa temprano estaba cansada – Al parecer te has estado portando muy mal porrista - Becky solo dio un saltito en respuesta estaba tan concentrada en terminar sus deberes que no se dio cuenta que Spike estaba a un lado de ella demasiado cerca para su gusto – Maldita sea Spike, que no tienes que estar planeando un robo a algún banco?- tenia que ser rápida y mordaz tal vez así con suerte la dejaría en paz pero se podía ver en su rostro que en verdad la había asustado – No te preocupes tanto por mi, ese plan es para la semana que viene, no te preocupes no te hare daño me tienes miedo porrista? - pero a este que le pasaba, miedo? Becky ya tenia suficiente de esto y lo único que pudo hacer para aliviar el ambiente fue darle un golpe, la chica levanto la mano para darle una buena bofetada, pero Spike ya se sabia su rutina cada vez que afectaba algo a la chica esta responde con un golpe, algo que no era nada raro en ella, esta ves le sacaría provecho después de todo había sido ignorado por mucho tiempo, cuando la muchacha tenia la mano alzada este la tomo y la acerco hacia el y le propino un buen beso que duro poco ya que la Hielera lo empujo – Que demonios Spike que quieres de mi? A que estas jugando? – estaba harta lo único que ella quería era que la dejara en paz, no sabia a que estaba jugando pero algo era seguro ella no jugaría – Yo no estoy jugando nada porrista – aaa ahí estaba esa sonrisilla que tanto detestaba – Después de que termines aquí ve a la colina Cherry, te estaré esperando- pero se había dado un golpe en la cabeza o que pensó la Hielera, de ninguna manera estaría otra vez a solas con el y eso debió haberse reflejado en su rostro – Si no vas, habrá un rumor en la escuela porrista, un rumor donde se digan tus asañas en la cama y que den detalle de esos grandiosos pechos - bastardo! Becky tenia los puños cerrados – En serio crees que alguien se va a tragar tu historia – Spike solo la miraba arrogante – Quieres que lo averigüemos?, por mi no hay ningún problema, te estaré esperando – la pobre Becky estaba helada, lo mataría sin duda eso haría la colina Cherry era el mejor lugar nadie sabia que se reunirían y después tiraría el cuerpo al lago, mierda debía hacer algo no quería pasar el resto de su vida en la cárcel, al parecer tendría que hacer acto de presencia y terminar con este juego de una vez por todas.

Don't get why nearly everyone pairs Becky with Spike…… He's creepy and rude! Anyways this is set after they win the game against the Cowboys. Anyways, what if Junior made it obvious that he liked Becky after the game? Enjoy…………. I can't believe we won! Although, I kinda feel sorry for Uncle... I hope Junior is okay, he's been acting really weird towards me since he saw me by the lake. Not that I don't blame him, I, the emotionless Icebox, basically told him that I lked him, and wanted to kiss him. I couldn't help but think after the whistle was blown. My mind was still numb from the pure addrenaline rush I always got when I played football. I knew there was no way he liked me, I'm a girl who doesn't act or look like a girl, despite the fact that I have boobs. He probably likes Debbie, my cousin, the preppy, flounce what she's got, blonde girl. I took off my helmet and started to walk off the field. I tried to push these thoughts out of my head as I ran away from the field, and into my dad's arms. Then we both started to scream. \"We won! We won! We won!\" I screamed, jumping up and down. Then Junior joined in and took my hands, jumping up and down as well. \"We won! We won! We won!\" we yelled. Then Junior stopped and looked at me, and he came closer. \"We couldn't have done it without you, Icebox,\" he whispered softly in my ear. Then he moved in front of me and gave me a smile that made me feel safe and happy. And then, he leaned down and hesitantly put his lips on mine. I was covered in dirt, sweat, grass, and more, but I liked it. But then he started to pull back, it was then that I realized I hadn't kissed him back. I felt desperate to keep him there, to let him know that I liked, no loved him too. So I wrapped my right arm around his neck and gently pushed my lips against his, but it was shy. He noticed, because he wrapped his good arm around my waist and pushed back. That was when I heard something nobody in our tiny town would ever think they would hear. \"Icebox is kissing a boy!!\" Pulling away from Junior, I looked towards the voice, only to discover the entiren team was in a huddle around us. My cheecks suddenly turned ripe red, and I tried to get away, without hurting Junior's back and side. Damn it Junior let go please! I'm begging please let go… He didn't let me go though. Instead, he shifted his other arm to my waist also, and pulled me closer. I burried my face in his chest and neck, the smell of the ground and sweat wasn't as strong as it was on the rest of us, probably because he had been sitting out when I first went on the field. He tried to coax me to lift up my head from his body, and gently began to fiddle with my hair. When he accidently yanked a piece of my hair, I cringed only because it had caught me off guard. But, I felt him cringe and knew it was beacause of his back and side. I gently pulled away, and saw the pain in his face. I couldn't help what I did next, it was instict. I took one of his arms, his good one, and put it around my shoulder so he could lean on me. He did, and I knew two things. One he was greatful and two, he wasn't putting his full weight on me, he was probably scared he would crush me. I smiled at him, my eyes telling him, I could take it, even if I was in a skirt and football gear. He leaned a little more on me, and I looked at the rest of the team. From the little kids to the kids who were only one or two years younger than me. They were staring at us, but namely me. I didn't blame them, I was emotionless and never showed any interest in boys, until the day at WalMart, where we met Junior. The field was empty now, save for us. The parents trusted me to get everyone home safely, and it made me happy to know that. \"You guys were great out there,\" I said, beaming with pride, like an older sister. \"We wouldn't have won, if you didn't show up,\" Rad Tad mumbled. \"Yea, we would've had to forfeit when I got hurt if you didn't uhn-\" Junior started then was cut off by pain. \"Are you okay? Junior, where does it hurt?\" I asked, trying to hide the large amount of concern in my voice. He just turned his head to his left side and back. Then I understood, and I was terrified. However, to keep the little kids from worrying, I asked Nubie calmly to go get the first aid kit in the locker room. Then, I directed everyone else to the bleachers, hopeing my assumption was wrong. Helping Junior over to the bleachers I started to blush. The parents weren't here, so I'll have to do it myself, since I'm probably the only one who knows how to do it. When we reached the bleachers, I sat him down and he tried to lay doen on the long metal seat. I hated to do it, but I had to stop him from laying down. He looked at me, his eyes clouded with confusion and pain. I could only shake my head, no. Then Nubie came over to us, and in his skinny arms, he held the first aid kit. \"Umm. Junior, I-I need you to take off your um shirt and g-gear,\" I stuttered, my eyes focusing on the kit in front of me. \"What!? B-but you're a girl!\" the team squaked back at me. Everyone except Junior, he was red faced and starring at me like I was insane. \"Yea, I know I'm a girl, but Junior's side and back could be bruised, maybe even bleeding, and nobody but us is here. B-besides, when my mom was still here, she made me take emergency medical classes, even though I was just six,\" I said as I looked for gauze, mumbling the last part, but Junior still heard it. \"Okay, Tad, help me get my jersey over my head. Easy, now grab the chest pads,\" Junior calmly directed the younger boy. Then he looked toward me, trying his best to hid the pain in his eyes. Please review, this is a new type of fanfiction for me, so please tell me what you guys think, I'll add the next chapter in a few days.[Chapter 2] I'm back and thanx for all the reviews! Even if it's only two, it's still something! Anyways, on with da story!! I looked at Junior, his eyes clouded in pain. It hurt like a knife in the heart. I motioned for him to turn around, and saw the full damage Spike had caused. Half of his back was badly bruised with cuts that were bleeding, but there was one cut in an area so badly bruised, I knew it must have been where Spike's helmet hit. The cut itself was deep and long, not to mention it looked infected. Not good! Not good at all! I reached into the kit and pulled out three things. One long roll of gauze, a tube of disinfection cream, and a clean wash cloth. Jake suddenly appeared with two bottles of water and some germ-X. Taking the water from him I set it down next to my leg and held my hands together as Jake gave me a squirt of germ-X to clean my hands with. Calming myself down, I picked up one of the water bottles and opened it. Taking the wash cloth in one hand, and the water in the other, I poured the water onto the cloth. Carefully, trying to not hurt him, I gently rubbed the cloth over his entire back, paying extra attention to the deeper cuts. I felt Junior cringe, and I knew this must be hell for him, but he must've known I was being as gentle as I could be because he didn't pull away. When his back was as clean as possible, I removed the cloth and picked up the disinfection cream. \"S'okay, I can take it,\" Junior replied, trying to convince me. Putting some of the thick and sticky cream on my finger, I gently rubbed it over the cuts. I could feel more than see the cringe of his muscles. When I had to put cream on the jumbo cut in the majorly bruised area, I winced. \"Junior, this is really gonna hurt, but don't pull away. Kay?\" I asked, trying to mentally prep him for the pain I knew would come. \"Yea, j-just be careful,\" he stuttered back softly. \"Are you sure you know what your doing Becky?\" Jake and Johnny voiced everyone's question. \"Yea I know what I'm doing, I'm not stupid. And it's Icebox,\" I said, smiling because the team made me feel protected and happy, even when they were a pain. \"B-but we wanna call Icebox, but you're like our big sister. However, we can't call a sister Icebox, when she's got such a big heart,\" Nubie stated. \"Yea you can, besides Becky is too girly for me,\" I said, my voice a little gruff. Squeezing more disinfect onto my finger, I gingerly rubbed it onto the last cut. Junior cried out in pain, and my heart was squeezed by an invisible hand. Laying my other hand on his good shoulder, I gave it a gentle squeeze. Almost done Junior. Hang on a bit more. Laying my helmet on the ground, I picked up the gauze and pressed the beginning on Junior's back. \"What was that for! That hurt!\" Junior yelled. My hands moved around him to the front of his chest, and I felt him stiffen. Pulling the gauze around his chest and to his back again, I kept repeating the process. Each and every time I brought it to the front of his chest though, Junior would stiffen, and if my fingers accidentally slipped against his skin, he would make a deep and low gasp that only I heard. An invisible smile was etched on my face, Junior does like me after all! Even with no pom-poms… It's a miracle… It took me a while to remember that I had to tie it for him, and to make it worse for me, I had to tie it in front of his face! His hand moved gently over mine to hold down the gauze as I moved to sit in front of him. Blushing red, I took the thin strip of gauze, tied it off, and slipped it under and over a few strips, then I tied it off again. Looking anywhere, but at Junior's face, I looked to the sky, and noticed it was almost pitch black. \"Oh no, our parents are gonna kill me,\" I said, in a state of panic. \"Hey, we can stay at my house. And my mom'll call everyone and tell them we're there,\" Jake said. \"Yea, okay,\" everyone said. \"Guys? You forget something, your all guys and I'm a girl… NO way will my dad let me stay,\" I reminded them. \"Yea, but you live on the other side of town. Besides its not like we're gonna hit on you. One you are too old for most of us, two we just don't like you like that, and three, well… Plainly put, Junior would kill us,\" Johnny and Hanon stated in sync. \"Besides, no offense, you look dead on your feet. From how you look, you not only didn't sleep well last night, but used the rest of your energy winning the game and cleaning me up,\" Junior shyly piped up, \" 'Sides, I think I can carry you for a bit, you've been on your feet all day.\" \"I'm fine-\" I was cut off as a wave of dizziness hit me. I ended up leaning forward, right into Junior's bare and wrapped chest. \"Tad, Rudy, grab her gear. I'll carry her for a bit,\" Junior said. Oh no! What will happen? May have to change the rating to M in later chapters. I'll update again asap! Bye for now!!!![Chapter 3] Back again! I'm also trying to update my other story, Runo's Sorrow, so don't get angry if I don't update soon enough… Even though I only have one true reviewer… Junior's P.O.V. I looked down at the girl in my arms. If only I didn't push her away, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But… When we kissed, I felt a spark and didn't want to let go of her, and that ended us up here. She looked totally out of it. Is this what cheer leading does to you? If so, Becky better never do it again, or I know I'll lose it. To add to that, I heard Coach talking about how she hasn't been sleeping much… Is it because of me? \"Is something bothering you Junior?\" Jake's mom asked, her weird brown eyes concerned. \"I don't know, I just don't know,\" I said, confused. How could this girl take my heart as easy as we run plays? She is just so confusing, but so beautiful and caring, despite her tough 'n cool façade. Then something literally hit me. Looking up, I saw it was Johnny and Jake. \"Junior, it's time for your shower, don't worry, we'll watch over her. Just hurry up,\" Johnny said as he toweled his hair. \"OK, but come 'n get me when she wakes up, no matter what,\" I told them, concern for Becky was laced in my tone. Right when I got into the bathroom and stepped into the hot water, I remembered the bandages I had on. Lucky for me, they were waterproof… If Becky wakes up, she'll most likely have to wash my back. Then I heard someone yell, \"Junior! She's up!\" I was so happy she was OK , that I ran out of the shower and through the door. There was Becky, she was alright, but was really red in the face. I looked at her wondering why, when she covered her eyes and screamed, \"JUNIOR!\" The other guys finally said, \"Dude, need a towel?\" That was when I realized that, other than the bandages, I was as naked as the day I was born… Becky / Icebox p.o.v. All I could hear was a jumbled mix of words as I came too. \"Think she's OK?\" \"Hope she is… Just wondering, anyone know the story on her mom?\" The voices were becoming clearer. \"Gee guys, I don't think any of us know… 'Sides she was about five when she left…\" \"Wow, she leaned med. stuff at about five?! How did she remember all that?!\" \"I use to volunteer at the hospital, that way dad let me keep playing football,\" I told all of them as I opened my eyes. \"Wow, that's amazing. Oh wait a sec. Junior, she's up!\" Johnny yelled the last part. There was a startled sound from the bathroom, and then seconds later Junior ran into the room, stark naked. He looked at me, his face pure joy and then confusion when I covered my face blushing. At least I didn't see anything… \"JUNIOR!\" I screamed, and I heard some of the boys chuckle. Then someone said, \"Dude, need a towel?\" Once again, I'm glad I saw nothing. I am way too young to be thinking of guys like that, and way to young to be seeing them like that . Once everyone had calmed down a bit, I stood up and went to the bathroom to take a shower... SO SORRY IT IS SOOO SHORT AND LATE! I'M SO BUSY IT'S CRAZY! I'LL TRY TO UPDATE A .S .A .P IN A FEW DAYS. REMEMBER TO REVIEW![Chapter 4] Please forgive me for saying this..... But I will not be updating any of my stories anytime soon. I have: Exams, Karate(finally got my black belt), Swim team, Training(swimming, karate, track...), Sister(12 yr old) who has a crush on one of her best friends(he is also on the swim team with us...), Homework, Free Writing(I might actually get some of my poetry published), My b-day party next week, 4 sisters and 1 brother to take care of(when my parents aren't home), I have had this stupid cold for over a week, Help sister with dancing/cheer leading(she made the school's squad... Same sister mentioned above), AND my stories(which is just coming from memory, I haven't written/edited any of it) Please forgive me! Will update a.s.a.p. Meaning sometime before summer....[Chapter 5] Sighing, I slipped the rubber band in my hair onto my wrist to take my shower. Stepping under the hot water, I nearly cried out. My muscles and bones hurt so bad, I'd be lucky to be able to move tomorrow morning. When my hair was soaked, I grabbed the shampoo and lathered it in my dirty hair. Suddenly I smelled watermelon and strawberries. Must be the shampoo… It was actually really calming… As I washed the shampoo out of my hair, I started to scrub away at the dirt and grass stains on my arms and legs. Karma really hated me, cause I found a huge bruise on the back of my left calf. Wincing, I grabbed conditioner and quickly rubbed it in and washed it out of my hair. Grabbing a fluffy green towel, I dried my hair off and wrapped it around my body. Opening the door slightly, I stuck my head out and lo and behold, my \"pj's\" were on the other side of the room… A foot away from Junior, who had probably showered in the other bathroom. Uh oh . When I saw Jake's mom pick them up and hand them to me, I couldn't have thanked her enough. Throwing on everything, I combed my hair and put it back up in another ponytail. Stepping out of the bathroom, I looked at my feet as I walked to the couch. Halfway there, Junior asked me, \"Um… Becky, when do I take these bandages off?\" \"Tomorrow morning, I can see how it's healing and w-wash the cuts and re-bandage them,\" I stuttered. \"Hey Becky? How come you never wear your hair down * ?\" Rag Tag asked. \"Huh? Oh, it's easier to do things with it pulled back. 'Sides I use to be made fun of because of my hair,\" I told him, forgetting to tell him not to call me Becky. \"Becky, can you come here please?\" Jake's mom asked me. \"Uh, sure,\" I replied, standing in front of her. I felt her thin fingers take my hair out of the ponytail without yanking any of my hair. I guess she thought my hair looked un-kept cause she started to brush it softly. It actually felt nice to have a brush and not a comb running through my hair. When she stopped, I turned around and she handed me the brush, smiling. All of a sudden the guys pulled out sleeping bags and sat on them, starting to chat about the game and what had happened lately. I just walked to the sleeping bag I was sleeping on and slowly started brushing my hair. I never saw him move, but when I found a knot at the end of my hair, I felt his hands take the brush from me. I was about to turn around and yell at him, but he held me still with one of his hands. Knowing if I moved, I would be in trouble, I sat in place and waited. After a minute I felt the brush untangling the knot I had just found. After a few minutes, Junior, he's probably the only one who will ever touch my hair, * patted my smooth hair and sighed a light/happy sigh. I couldn't help what I did next. I leaned back onto his chest and leaned my head back onto his shoulder. When I saw his smile, I felt my insides turn to water as he bent his head down, resting it in the crook of my neck. Junior POV Ok, after I brushed her hair I lost it. I know it sounds weird, but her hair smells so good, like strawberries and watermelon. I put my head in the crook of her neck and inhaled deeply. She must have used a watermelon body wash or something, cause that's all I could smell. Her hair was still kinda damp, but dry for the most part. Since it was still wet, it was easier to smell the strawberry shampoo she had used. It was comforting to have her in my arms and her calming scent * surrounding me. Shifting my head, I placed my lips next to her pulse and smiled. Despite the whole tough-girl get up, I know that she is easily hurt by other people's words. When Jake's mom came in again, she handed us a few flashlights and set three candles on the kitchen table. \"There's supposed to be a really bad storm tonight… Hope it won't do much harm to the fields and roads,\" She said as she wrung her hands. We all smiled and nodded our heads, this was our cue to head off to bed, or at least get ready for it. Since everyone but Becky was where they were sleeping, Becky got up carefully and sat down on the couch behind my head. I could hear her soft breathing as she lay down. Just before I got into my sleeping bag, I turned my head to her and pressed my lips to her forehead. As I turned around, Becky kissed my temple gingerly. I smiled and kissed the pulse on her neck, feeling her shudder caused me to softly chuckle. \"Good night, Becky,\" I whispered in her ear. \"D-don't call me Be-\" She started to say, before I kissed her lips, forcing her to be quiet. \"Alright, good night Junior,\" Becky mumbled as I laid down, falling asleep. *- I always wear my hair in a ponytail... Throws self down on the ground, begging for forgiveness. IM SO SORRY! I MEANT TO UPDATE SOONER! ~RunosSister[Chapter 6] Becky's POV It was dark and the storm was loud. Lightning and thunder had started dancing the minute my head hit the pillow. It was scary, seeing bolts of lightning every five minutes followed by booming thunder. The ground seemed to shake underneath the house as I sat up, too scared to sleep. Gently taking the blanket and pillow I had been given, I lay down on the floor and curled into a ball. It was not as bad as being on the sofa, at least I could feel something more solid under me. The storm seemed to quiet down for a moment, but then there was a harmony of the thunder and lightning. Terrified, I yanked myself up, accidently letting out a light scream. \"Hat's da matter Beky?\" a voice, thick with sleep asked. \"J-junior?\" I asked, stuttering as I shivered. \"Ya?\" \"I'm scared. It's so loud and dark,\" I cried, cursing the tears on my face. Junior didn't respond. He pulled me to him and laid down with my face resting near the bandage of his shoulder. \"I'll protect you Becky, try to sleep.\" Those words stopped my tears, and my mind relaxed as his arms drew me closer. I closed my eyes and began blocking out the sounds of the roaring thunder and whip-like lightning. Slowly, but surely, I drifted off to sleep. Images of the game we won hours before flashing behind my eyes. Junior's POV The storm had been loud all night, how I and the guys managed to fall asleep was a miracle itself… In my dream there I was in the middle of a football field, alone. Then there was someone calling my name, sweetly but boyishly at the same time, like a lover that wasn't all girly… My perfect girl. I turn around, and there waiting for me at the other end of the field was an eighteen year old Becky, waving for me to come over. \" C'mon Junior! Practice is over, my Uncle wants to talk to us about signing with a team,\" she hollered, waving her hand. I smiled and began running towards her. Yet, the harder and farther I ran, the farther she was from me. Desperate to reach her, I jumped. Ripping my eyes open, I realize where I am. At one of the teammates houses, during a storm… A sudden shriek was what had made me wake up. Turning my head towards the sound, I asked a question as clearly as I could. \"Hat's da matter Beky?\" my voice was thick with sleep. \"J-junior?\" she asked, stuttering as if she wanted comfort. \"Ya?\" \"I'm scared. It's so loud and dark,\" she replied, it sounded like she was crying. Reaching towards her, I pulled her down and under my blanket. I wrapped my arms around her and held her close. \"I'll protect you Becky, try to sleep,\" I whispered into her sweet smelling hair. She seemed to relax as I tightened my arms around her. Smiling smugly, I buried my nose in her hair and neck as I fell asleep again. THIS IS WAAAAAY LONG OVERDUE! PLEASE TELL ME I STILL HAVE A REVIEWER? I GROVEL AT YOUR KEYBOARDS FOR FORGIVNESS!

Anyways "},{"Movie":"Singin' in the Rain","Title":"A New Kind of Celebrity","Author":"ScarletRain7713","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10554746","Passage":"[Chapter 1] In the late 1920s, show business was absolutely booming. Nothing could seem to go wrong for musical director Cosmo Brown, his superstar best friend Don Lockwood, and the not-so-lovely leading lady, Lina Lamont. Though he never really received the much deserved spotlight, Cosmo didn't complain. He couldn't. It wasn't every celebrity who took their friends with them to the top, let alone have a part in the production of the time's most popular films. It was premier night for Don and Lina's newest film, The Royal Rascal , and the \"lovely\" couple made their way down the red carpet. Cosmo stood by the entrance, waiting for Don's arrival. As he and other celebrities made their way inside, Cosmo decided to stand outside, at least until everyone was in, so he could avoid the madness for a few moments longer. He was just about to go inside when he heard a protest, sounding like that of a fusing child. He turned to see that it was—however, this fusing child was being forcibly shoved into a police car. \"Now young lady, quit being so darn difficult!\" \"I don't want to go! I don't need to!\" she retaliated. \"Hey now, what's going on?\" a curious Cosmo asked, stepping into the picture. \"This child came all the way from Italy. Parents sent her with no family, no money, nothing. I'm making sure she returns to the home she was placed in.\" Cosmo took a look at the poor girl. She had on a frilled red dress, covered with a fuzzy white over-coat. She had on matching white pantyhose and black buckle shoes, and would have been a precious little thing, had it not been for her tear-stained cheeks and her puffy red eyes, almost hiding the beauty of her natural darkened blue eyes, complimented by her dark hair and pale skin. Definitely of Italian descent. Cosmo's heart began to ache for the poor girl, and he was aware of the poor treatment orphaned children received, especially immigrant children. \"Well, it's no wonder she doesn't wanna go with ya, she don't know ya! She's lookin' for me.\" Cosmo lied, using whatever acting skills he possessed. The girl cocked her head, utterly confused, and the cop replied, \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, this here is my little niece, coming to the States. Parents wanted a better opportunity for ya, right kid?\" \"They died during the Great War,\" she replied solemnly. Cosmo looked to the cop. \"Exactly. They obviously can't provide for her in that state,\" he said quietly, as to not further upset her. \"So she's living here, with her uncle Cosmo. I was greeting the guests and she got lost in the crowd, isn't that right, kid? Awe, come 'ere.\" She began to see what he was doing and moved toward him, allowing Cosmo to lift her. \"There ya go, all safe. Anything else I can do for ya, officer?\" The cop looked at him suspiciously, but heard voices coming from his vehicle about a robbery or whatnot, calling for all units. \"Fine, but if I catch her out alone again, I'm sending her back,\" he said threateningly, jumped in his car, and took off. \"Maybe someone should send him back to his mama's to learn how to treat a little lady, huh?\" Cosmo said to the still shocked child, though he managed to make her smile. \"So what's your name, kid?\" \"Annabelle. But he's right, they're looking for me at the orphanage. I don't want to go back 'cause they all tease me.\" Cosmo looked at her, still holding her, surprised that such a young natural-born Italian could speak English so well. With his usual comic demeanor set aside, he asked, \"Now why would they tease such a pretty little thing like you?\" \"I'm not from here.\" she said simply, looking as though she were talking to the ground instead of Cosmo. \"So? I'm not from here either—I'm from the house a couple blocks away.\" She slightly giggled, and tightened her grip on Cosmo's neck when he tried to set her down. He realized she didn't want to leave (as if she had anywhere else to go) and said, \"Okay, Annie, I'll make ya a deal. You let me put you down, and you can come stay with uncle Cosmo.\" She looked to him curiously and said, \"You aren't my uncle.. Are you?\" It was Cosmo's turn to laugh and he replied, \"Well, I got the cop thinking so. From here on out I'll see to it that you don't go back to that orphanage, ya hear?\" The girl, stunned as any child would be, nodded her head, and allowed Cosmo to put her down. He offered her his hand, and she took it with no hesitation and followed him into the party. Shortly after they entered, Cosmo had found Don on stage, making a speech about the production. Clearly, the movie had ended. \"I'm sorry,\" said Annie. Cosmo was taken aback. \"For what, kid?\" \"I made you miss the film...\" Cosmo knelled to her height and said, \"If I wanna see that movie, I'll just tell Don to run around and move his lips without making any sounds.\" Annie giggled again, and her expression was much brighter compared to about ten minutes ago. Cosmo had only known this girl for those ten minutes, but nonetheless he was glad she was no longer crying her heart out. \"Hey there, Cos,\" Don said casually, seeming to pop up from nowhere. Cosmo jumped slightly, and Annie tightened her grip on his hand. \"Who's your little pal, there?\" She buried her face in Cosmo's suit, as if that made her invisible, and he replied, \"It's a long story. Meet me at my place after the gig and I'll tell ya all about it.\" With that, he took Annie hastily from the theater and took her to his place. \"Well, here we are, Brown Manor,\" he said comically. \"Where you're from?\" Annie smiled, reliving the joke he had made earlier. He laughed and took her in to run a bath. \"No.\" She said simply when he started running the water. \"Come on, kid. Don't be that way. It's just water,\" he said. \"Never!\" yelled the stubborn child, and she took off in whatever way she could to avoid a bath. \"Oh, so that's how it's gonna be? I let you in and you stink up the place?\" Cosmo yelled after her, turning off the water to get her. She was already well hidden before he got the chance to catch up. \"Oh where, oh where has Annabelle gone?\" he sung dramatically to the tune of \"Oh where oh where Has my Little Dog Gone\", paying close attention for any signs of the child. \"Oh where, oh where can she be? She's hiding somewhere in my house right now, and in trouble she will be ifshedoesn'ttakeabathrightnow!\" he sang, cramming the last verse. He heard a stifled laugh come from his room. \"Aahh,\" he said in satisfaction, walking casually into his room. He knew right away she was under his bed. What made it fun was that she didn't know he knew. \"Well, I'm awful tired, I'll try looking for her tomorrow.\" Cosmo said, and jumped on his bed. The smart girl, before he landed, fled out from under the bed and into the kitchen. \"Hey! Come back here, you little troublemaker!\" It was the first time he heard her genuinely laugh, and he was now running toward the kitchen. She made sure the table had separated them. Cosmo flashed a mischievous smirk. \"You think that table's gonna stop me?\" She shrugged, and nodded. \"Ya don't talk much, do ya, kid?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"I can't make ya talk, but I'll bet anything I can make ya laugh!\" With that, Cosmo ran around the table, causing Annie to run around to avoid him. Unexpectedly, Cosmo jumped over the table, landing right in front of the child. Quickly, she dove under the table to try to get to the other side, but she wasn't quick enough, and Cosmo grabbed her around the waist. \"Ha! I gotcha!\" he jeered, listening to her helplessly giggling. He tightened his grip on the young girl's waist and spun, causing her to hold on tightly and laugh even harder. He only stopped when he saw his movie star friend Don, standing there with a big grin on his face. \"Hey there, Cos. Are you gonna introduce me to this little lady or what?\" Don asked lightheartedly. \"Well Don, this here is Annabelle, my Italian niece.\" \"I didn't know you had a niece.\" \"Well I didn't, til today.\" \"What?\" Cosmo paused and set the child down. \"Listen, Annie. You be a good girl for uncle Cosmo and take a bath while I talk to my friend Don, okay?\" \"Okay,\" Annie said reluctantly, and Cosmo watched as she went into the bathroom and closed the door. \"Alright Don, have a seat.\" The two sat, and Cosmo proceeded to tell Don all about the officer and the orphaned girl. \"She just looked so upset, Don, I couldn't let 'em take her. It's hard enough losing your parents, but being forced to come to a foreign country only to be treated bad in a run-down orphanage? I just couldn't let it happen.\" Cosmo concluded. Don had been listening intently, and smiled admiringly at his friend. \"Cos, I think you did good today.\" \"Oh gee, do you really?\" \"I really do. And that Annabelle couldn't have been luckier to have you as a guardian.\" \"Ya mean it?\" \"You bet, pal. Go ahead and bring her with ya on set tomorrow. Maybe we can get her outta that shell, ya know? Tell us more about herself.\" \"Yeah, maybe, maybe. She's real shy, but real easy to make laugh.\" Cosmo smiled. \"It's easy to make the sourest man on earth laugh for you, Cos. I'll leave ya to it tonight, and I'll see you and Annie bright and early.\" \"You sure will, Don.\" Cosmo replied as Don left. As if on cue, a little cry for Uncle Cosmo came from the bathroom. He opened the door to find her wrapped up in a towel, looking absolutely adorable. He took the girl to his room, where he found an old shirt that no longer fit him, and gave it to her. As she put it on, he went to the bathroom to put his own night clothes on, and came back to find a wet towel on the floor and no girl to be seen. \"Okay, Annie, it's late, time to turn in for the night.\" No response. \"Jeez, you like to hide, don't ya?\" He said, and opened his closet door, finding her easily. \"You're gonna have to do a lot better than that to hide from ol' Cosmo!\" he said excitedly, picking her up and tossing her on the bed. \"Since I don't have a place for you to sleep yet, you'll sleep here and I'll take the couch.\" He got up to leave, but he felt a tug on his shirt, and looked to see the girl, obviously not wanting him to leave. \"Alright, alright, I give! Just don't make that face, ya look like you're gonna cry.\" Her face instantly lit up as he said, \"Well, ya want me to sleep in here, don't ya? You need to scoot over!\" Annie had already come to know Cosmo's playful nature, so she didn't budge. \"Is that how it's gonna be?\" he asked, and with her nod, he slid his hands under her small body and moved her aside, giving him space to crawl into bed. \"Now we gotta get some rest for tomorrow morning, ya hear? Uncle Cosmo's taking ya to work with him.\" \"Okay!\" she beamed, and lay down to go to sleep. \"Finally!\" Cosmo said dramatically, and with that he settled and soon fell asleep himself.[Chapter 2] Cosmo rose at about 7:30 the next morning, and the sleeping child on the opposite side of the bed proved that he had not been dreaming—he really was the guardian of this poor foreign soul. \"Maybe now she stands a chance in this world,\" Cosmo thought, still looking at the dormant girl. He got up, careful not to wake her just yet, and got himself dressed. They were to begin shooting for a new picture today, called The Dueling Cavalier. He left his house for a brief moment to go to the department store down the street to pick up some clothes for her. \" She can't wear the same thing every day,\" he thought, and when he returned he set the clothes on the end of the bed and gently shook the girl. She moved slightly, and turned to face her care-giver. Ever so slowly, she sat up, and rubbed the drowsiness from her eyes. \"Well, good morning, Sleeping Beauty,\" Cosmo said calmly. \"We got a full day ahead.\" She took the covers and, in one quick motion, pulled them over her head and laid back down. \"Oh, Annie, don't do that. Come on, kid.\" Cosmo urged. No response. \"Alright then,\" he sang, and yanked the covers off as quickly as she had put them on. She failed to hide her grin as she said, \"Good morning, uncle Cosmo.\" \"Is it now? It may be noon before you get out of bed!\" he said with false impatience. She sat up again, and reached for the covers yet again, only this time a hand swiftly, yet gently, took her wrist and Cosmo said, \"Don't even think about it.\" Annie laughed as Cosmo reached for the bag sitting at the edge of the bed, pulling out a frilled white dress, similar to that of the red except it was lined with sequins. \"Your new dress is so pretty, uncle Cosmo,\" Annie said. Cosmo was stunned at the comment, first because he didn't expect a joke from her and second because it was actually a good one. He narrowed his eyes and played along, \"Oh, do ya like it? It might be a little small but I think it brings out my eyes.\" Little Annie giggled as she sat up to get herself dressed so they could go. They reached Monumental Pictures in a few short minutes. In that time, Cosmo was warning her about the people and how she didn't have to answer to them, but she must be on her best behavior. \"As long as you'll be there, I'll be okay,\" she replied. They got out of the car, and right before they entered, Annie stopped and tugged on her new uncle's shirt. \"What is it, kid?\" he asked. She said nothing, but raised her arms up, indicating that she wanted picked up. \"Already? We haven't even made it past the front door!\" Her expression was unchanging, bound and determined. Fortunately for her, Cosmo gave in. \"Alright, fine, but just for a little bit.\" He hoisted her up and she made herself comfortable, wrapping her arms around his neck and laying her head on his shoulder. \"You're lucky you're so gosh-darn cute, ya know,\" he said, with a defeated tone. Cosmo made his way to Don, who was sitting in his usual chair and going over his lines. Cosmo received glances from a few extras and other actors, but nothing too disturbing or extreme. \"Hey there, Don,\" he greeted casually. Don looked up from his script and smiled at the sight of his pal. \"Hey Annie, say hello to your uncle Donnie, here,\" Cosmo urged, but the girl buried her face deeper into his sweater. \"Aww well, it's alright, Annie. I'm not doing so hot myself. I can't stop thinking about that Kathy girl..\" Don admitted, with a faded smile and a concerned tone. \"Ah, yes, the only girl able to resist you,\" Cosmo said, meaning it in a good-humored way, but judging by the sour look on Don's face the comment made it worse. \"Oh, come on, snap out of it. You're Don Lockwood, aren't ya? Don Lockwood is an actor, and every actor knows 'The show must go on!' Come rain, come shine, come snow, come sleet, the show must go on!\" Cosmo exclaimed dramatically in an attempt to cheer up his friend. He also attempted to dislodge the girl, but no avail. \"Here, Don, hold this. Hate to let ya down, Annie,\" he said, making the two laugh slightly as the girl complied and sat on Mr. Lockwood's lap. Cosmo made his way toward a piano and began to play, changing the tone of the music along with his voice. \"Short people, have long faces, and long people, have short faces. Big people have little humor, and little people, havenohumoratall.\" His priceless expressions in addition to jumping on the piano were irresistibly funny, and both Don and Annie genuinely laughed. Cosmo beamed, and continued to act on goofy impulse, breaking into song. \" Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh! Don'tcha know everyone wants to laugh? \" With that, he hit Don upside the head with his hat a couple of times, then proceeded to throw the hat aside and squeezed his niece's knees while she was secure in Don's grip. \"Uncle Cosmo!\" she squealed, but he continued to sing and dance around the studio, performing enough slap-stick to keep Annie and Don laughing the entire time. \" Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh! \" Cosmo sang as he finished his number, and collapsed from what seemed like repeatedly injuring himself. Annie jumped from Don's lap and they both ran over to Cosmo, who slowly sat up, holding his head. Annie giggled and hugged him tight around the neck, and when she released, Don helped him up and patted his shoulder. \"Thanks, pal. Maybe now I can at least get through this first rehearsal.\" Don commented. \"Ah, relax, you'll be great, just as you always are,\" Cosmo reassured. \"I don't know, uncle Cosmo. You might need to do that number again. Uncle Don still looks a little sad,\" Annie remarked, and put on a sad puppy-dog face. Don knelled down to Annie's height and made the same face. Cosmo, being a master at playing the part, smiled and remarked, \"Sure! I'll take it from the top.\" He wriggled his fingers menacingly, crouching down toward his niece, slowly at first, humming \"Make 'em Laugh.\" \"Uh oh, Annie. Don't worry, I'll hold him for ya!\" Don stood quickly and blocked his friend while the young girl ran behind the actor's legs, shielding herself from Cosmo's wrath. \"He's.. Too.. Strong..\" Don said dramatically, \"losing\" his grip on his pal. Cosmo then swiftly maneuvered around Don, scooped up the girl, and dropped her on the nearby couch. He lightheartedly sang \"Make 'em Laugh\" as he tickled the life out of his young niece, making Don watching in the background chuckle. The girl squealed before laughing as Cosmo ran his fingers along her sides, then worked his way to her belly, causing yet another squeal. \"Ticklish little thing, aren't ya?\" he teased, and chuckled when she nodded through her laughing fit. Don came up and placed a hand on Cosmo's shoulder, signaling it was time for his rehearsal, also meaning Cosmo had to produce the music for the silent film. Cosmo ceased his tickling attack, but something about his grin told Annie it wouldn't be the last, and she took his hand, having to almost jog as they moved quickly to make it to their places on time. Annie watched Cosmo in amazement as he conducted the orchestra. Each movement of his meant something, she didn't know what, but the orchestra sure did as they produced a beautiful piece for the romantic scene between Don and Lina. They played the part of a romantic couple, but Don's eyes gave away that he was upset about something, and seemed to be a bit out of his game. Luckily their producer, R.F., came by and stopped everything. \"Listen up, team, we have a situation. We have to change The Dueling Cavalier into a talking picture. The Jazz Singer was a total hit and the crowd wants more,\" he said, speaking quickly as if he were wasting time presenting the news. \"A talking picture?\" Don and Cosmo repeated, knowing that in Lina's case, that could not be good. \"A talking picture!\" Lina exclaimed, obviously excited about the news. \"Yes, a talking picture. So stop production today, and you and Lina will soon be seeing your new diction coaches,\" R.F. Said, speaking to Don, and walked off hastily. Lina ran off in excitement and Cosmo walked up to Don. R.F quickly made his way back to Don and Cosmo, and looked down at the girl standing in the middle. \"Who is this?\" \"Why, this is my niece Annabelle. Annie, this is my boss,\" Cosmo said somewhat nervously, not thinking of R.F. when the decision was made to bring her. \"How do you do?\" Annie greeted politely. R.F. looked at her a moment longer before replying \"Fine. Cosmo?\" \"Yes sir?\" \"If you were to allow it, I would like to have Annie take a lesson as well. I see a fantastic opportunity for her here, if she learned to speak properly.\" \"What's wrong with my speach?\" Annie said, suddenly feeling self-conscious. \"No worries, Annie. Just gonna help you speak English a bit better, okay? I'll have her ready for it,\" Cosmo said, confirming Annie's lesson. \"Wonderful,\" R.F. Said, and left the three of them to talk. \"Well, this should be interesting, huh pal?\" Cosmo asked, knowing Don had not a clue about how to take the news. \"Yeah, I'll say. I'll see you tomorrow, Cos. I heard Kathy's getting a part in one of R.F's other films and is somewhere around here. I'm gonna try to make it right,\" Don said, knowing his words had instigated Kathy the other night to throw a cake, accidentally at Lina, and it cost her her job. \"There ya go!\" Cosmo encouraged, giving Don a pat on the back. \"I'll take little Annie home. Tomorrow oughta be something for all of us,\" he said. Don nodded in agreement, and the friends parted ways, with Annie following close behind Cosmo. She snagged his shirt again and stopped, and when he turned she rose her arms. He put his hands on his hips and gave her a semi-stern look. \"Again? You have two working legs, don't ya?\" She collapsed her legs, falling on her rear, with her arms still in the air. The part of his look that was stern dissipated and he gave, lifting her and finally walking out to his car. \"Ya know, with that face of yours, you could wind up as big as Don Lockwood himself,\" Cosmo stated, realizing that he'd given in to Annie very often due to her endearing appearance. She said nothing and smiled brightly, confirming his statement. However, she replied, \"I couldn't do that, uncle Cosmo. I do not know how to dance or sing or act as good as you and uncle Don can.\" They arrived home, and Cosmo helped her out of the car. \"Little Annie, you can do anything you set your mind to,\" he encouraged. She looked to the ground and replied, \"But I'm afraid.\" \"You still have your whole life to think about what you wanna do. But what you do have to think about right now is where you're gonna hide, 'cause your uncle Cosmo is a master and I'm only giving you a minute,\" he smirked, watching the comprehension wash over the young Italian's face. \" Priceless, \" he thought as the girl raced into the house, locking the door behind her, which may have saved her a couple of seconds, but was ultimately no use considering Cosmo still had the key. \" Okay, Annie, where would uncle Cosmo never think to look ?\" the girl asked herself. Pacing around the house, she tried to focus on where to go, but the anticipation and knowing time was limited was clouding her train of thought. Then, the idea presented itself to her, clear as day. She ran up the stairs to her uncle's room, and hopped into the hamper. Luckily, it seemed to be mostly vests and blazers, and she buried herself amongst the clothes, and did so more hastily once she heard the door open. He didn't call anything out, thus making his location in the house unknown. This only increased the amount of anxiety building up for Annie. Cosmo, on the other hand, actually had no idea where she was. He looked in the most obvious of hiding places, like closets, under tables, etc. \"Oh, where are you, Annie?\" Cosmo called out finally, fearing he might be beaten at his own game. He went up the stairs, and checked the closet and under the bed in his room. Annie, being sure to stay perfectly still while he was searching, developed a dangerous idea, one that she mentally debated on weather or not the repercussions would be worth it. But Annie decided to go for it and, while Cosmo's back was turned, crawled out of the hamper, successfully snuck up on him, and wrapped her arms around one of his legs. She then proceeded to squeeze the top of his knee, as he had done to her previously on set, and developed a wide grin as Cosmo jumped and giggled like that of a little girl. \"Gotcha!\" \"AH! Haha, whahy you little sneak!\" he laughed, and with every attempt to reach for Annie's hands, she switched knees. It wasn't long before he collapsed on his bed, and planned on hoisting the girl up there to exact revenge, but she was smart enough to let go and run as fast as her legs could carry her down the stairs. Cosmo was hot on her trail, and once they were down the stairs and right before Annie could grasp the doorknob to run outside, Cosmo wrapped his arm around her waist, exclaiming, \"Oh no you don't, you rotten little girl!\" she struggled in his grip, and he was sure to keep her immobile. The poor girl, held by her waist, couldn't control her laughter as Cosmo carried her through the living room and back up the stairs, muttering \"How dare you!\" and \"Little rat!\" during the trip. She expected to be tossed on the bed, as Cosmo usually does when they play, but this time was different. He sat down on the bed, still with a firm grasp around her waist, and used his free hand to viciously tickle her sides and knees. \"Eeek!\" she squealed, and tried to pry herself free of his arm, but he was far too strong. \"Someone's gotta teach you some manners!\" Cosmo said, trying to sound level but the excitement was evident in his voice. In the back of his mind, he knew he used to doubt the adoption of Annabelle, knowing that society didn't favor single parents. And this was something totally new to him—he hadn't a clue how to raise a child, and everything he'd done up to this point was instinct and common sense. However, if he'd been given the same opportunity to take her in, he knew he'd do it. Cosmo snapped out of his reflective trance when Annie yelped, and accidentally kicked his leg. He found that his hand had wondered up to her underarm, and she continued to squeal apologies and kick violently. He stopped suddenly, and Annie's tense body finally relaxed, and she rested her head on Cosmo's chest. He rocked the young girl back and forth, and could hear her breath slowing from a quick panting to deeper breaths, as if she were falling asleep. \"Annie, you can't go to sleep yet,\" he said. The young girl moaned. \"I probably shouldn't have tickled ya so much, you wouldn't be tired.\" Cosmo didn't know how far he should push her, but while she was relaxed was probably a good time to bring up questions. \"So, Annie, I was wondering... What were your parents like?\" The question caught the girl off guard, and her body tensed up again out of discomfort. \"I just figured, if I knew a little bit more about ya, I could maybe help ya, ya know?\" Cosmo reasoned. Annie looked to him. \"They weren't all bad. They just were never around. I was by myself or with a nanny a lot, and she wasn't nice.\" she said. Cosmo saw the pain in her eyes and he could relate. She continued, \"I like it here much more, in America, with you and uncle Don and R.F... but not Lina..\" she commented, making Cosmo chuckle. \"Awe, you don't mean that. Lina's perfect. She told me so herself.\" he remarked, and Annie giggled at his comment. He was always making her laugh, something she hadn't done so often in her home country. Cosmo had always been more of the comic relief, but he allowed an unknown affectionate side of him to show itself, and he genuinely hugged Annie and kissed her cheek, making her feel more at home than she ever would have felt anywhere else. \"I love you, uncle Cosmo,\" she said wholeheartedly. \"I love you too, kid,\" he replied, meaning it more than he thought he would. Truthfully, he didn't believe he was going to keep Annie for longer than a few days, let alone claim her as his. \" Things happen for a reason, \" he thought, and continued to hold her as he went against his previous claim and let her fall asleep.[Chapter 3] It's been about a week since Annie was taken in, and since she has grown accustom to living with Cosmo, so much so that she almost felt like a normal child... Almost. Annie woke up extra early and extra anxious one particular morning. Why? \"Uncle Cosmo wants to take me to a... d-dictionary coach,\" she thought out loud, quietly walking down the stairs as to not wake her guardian. At first, R.F. wanted to pair her with a female diction coach, as would be expected. However, that would mean Annie would be speaking alongside Lina Lamont, and the crew soon learned she was having none of that. An eventual compromise was made—Annie still had to take lessons, as to make her Italian accent less noticeable, but she would be going with Don. \"There is nothing wrong with the way I speak,\" she said to herself, and for the first time noticing how thick her accent really was. She recited her previous sentence over and over again, trying yet failing to eliminate the Italian in her voice. However, she had barely reached the kitchen when familiar footsteps were heard coming from the second floor, followed by her uncle's voice. \"Annie! Come on girl, get dressed or you and Donnie will be late!\" The child panicked, and dove into one of the cabinets under the sink. Cosmo, who believed she was playing, tip-toed into the kitchen and knocked on the cabinet as if it were a door. \"Hello in there? Is anyone home?\" he asked kindheartedly, as he always was with the child. She peeked out and answered with a fierce \"NO,\" and she shut the cabinet back up. \"Oh, Annie,\" he said, opening the door and scooping her out. For once, she struggled against his grip. \"Gee Annie, what's the matter?\" asked the now-concerned guardian. \"I don't want to go,\" she said simply. The effort to remove her accent hadn't gone unnoticed, and Cosmo let out a sigh. He replied with an Italian accent as he said, \"Little Annie, there's nothing wrong with your accent.\" The mimicking of her accent made her look up and smile slightly. He continued, now speaking normally, \"But it's a good idea to learn an American accent.. Ya know... In America.\" She shrugged. \"Now, let's get ya dressed, huh? I'll run you to Donnie's, run a couple of errands, and I bet I can make it to your lesson before it's over.\" he tried to be somewhat stern, and it must have worked as Annie, although reluctantly, made her way back up the stairs to get herself dressed. Once they left the house, it took a few short minutes to reach Don's mansion. He must have heard the car pull up as he came outside to greet Cosmo, as good friends would. Don Lockwood then knelled to Annie's height to greet her. \"Well, good morning little Annie. You ready for the lesson?\" He was truly trying to be kind, but she was still upset, and swiftly shook her head. Don chuckled and lifted her and looked to Cosmo, who attempted to hide his worried expression by commenting, \"Ya know what? Annie is more spoiled than Lina Lamont herself. Turns out, Annie barely even has to walk for herself!\" After seeing that she was in no mood for humor, he gave a fatherly kiss to her forehead as he said his goodbyes and drove off, leaving an inexperienced Don to tend to his five-year-old niece. \"Well Annie, make yourself at home, though we'll be leaving shortly,\" he said, carrying the child into his manor. He set her down, and expected her to follow him in. However, she remained by the doorway. \"Cos was right—you don't walk for yourself!\" Don said, trying to be comical, but no good. Overall, he knew little about children, and remembered virtually nothing about being a child himself, other than performing alongside Cosmo to make a quick buck. Defeated, he sighed, and asked, \"Okay, Annie, what's wrong? And don't say you're mad because I wanted you to walk.\" He was a little better off in getting her to smile at the comment, but she looked to him with disappointed eyes, simply stating, \"I don't want to go.\" Part of Don sympathized for the young girl. It can't be easy coming to the United States in a time where immigrants were not exactly welcomed. No wonder she had taken to Cosmo so well—he was never the discriminating type. \"You don't like me because I'm not from here,\" she said, almost reading his mind. However, the statement was not totally true. \"No no, Annie, I never meant to come across that way. I do like you, kid.\" \"Do you?\" \"Of course.\" It seemed neither had expected the sudden tense moment, for Annie's eyes began to water, and Don didn't really know what to say. \"I'm sorry, Don, I didn't mean to...\" \"Shhhh, it's okay, Annie,\" he said, trying to sooth her. It was then that Don noticed the time, and dried her tears. \"Come on girl, or we'll be late. I promise it won't be that bad.\" When they arrived, Don was satisfied to find that they had a couple minutes to spare. Annie, on the other hand, still wanted nothing to do with the lesson, and was reluctant about going in. \"The doc is waiting for us in there,\" Don urged as he unbuckled her. However, she decided to keep a firm grip on the strap. \"Annie, the faster we get in there the faster it'll be over. Come on,\" Don said sternly. She obliged and followed him into the office. \"Well, right on time Mr. Lockwood and Miss..\" the diction coach greeted, clearly not being informed that Annie was coming with Don. \"Miss Annabelle Brown, sir,\" Don answered, filling in the blank for his coach. Annabelle threw him a look, knowing Brown wasn't her last name, but Don threw back a wink. \"Well, how do you do, Miss Brown?\" asked the professor. \"Well, sir.\" The child's accent caught him off guard, but he refocused and insisted they begin their lesson. He looked into a little yellow book and picked an alliteration for them to start with. \"Ah, this one seems like a good starting point. Repeat after me: Seven snakes slithered across the Sahara Desert.\" Don repeated, enunciating each word perfectly. \"Marvelous, Mr. Lockwood! Now you, Miss Brown,\" stated the professor. Annie repeated, trying to delete her accent. However, the professor shook his head discouragingly, and knelled to her level. \"No no, dear, like this...\" he repeated, speaking more slowly for her. She tried again, this time ridding herself of majority of her accent. \"Definitely better. Let's try another, shall we?\" he prompted. \"I suppose,\" Annie replied. Don could tell she was uncomfortable with most of the professor's attention, so at times he would make comments or interrupt until at some point the doctor said, \"I have a suggestion. Why don't I give an example, and both of you repeat it?\" Annie gave Don a weak smile, who said, \"Okay doc, let's give it a shot.\" \"Very well then,\" he replied, giving them a series of alliterations, which they would repeat in unison. Eventually, Annie's accent was becoming more under control while Don was gaining the needed experience to perform in a talkie. \"Now for something more challenging—Around the rocks, the ragged rascal ran.\" More challenging in that he rolled his R's and spoke a bit faster. The pair repeated, this time Don had gotten corrected. \"No no no, r ocks,\" he emphasized. As Don repeated, Annie heard the door open behind them. She turned and her eyes lit up at the sight of Cosmo. \"Uncle Cosmo!\" she yelped, running full speed into her uncle's ready arms. \"Aww, Annie! It wasn't that bad, now was it?\" The girl nodded, and Cosmo gave her a semi-suspicious look. \"Honest?\" he said, making his way to Don and the professor. She shook her head 'no', and Cosmo chuckled. \"I didn't think so.\" \"Ah, you must be her father,\" he professor said as a greeting. \"Uncle, actually. It's a pleasure, doc. I hope she's behaved for ya,\" Cosmo replied, adding a firm handshake. Annie had attached herself to Cosmo's leg, elated that he had returned. The professor noticed the child and said, \"Well, we were just getting started with the more challenging exercises, if you would like to see her progress.\" \"Oh yeah Cos, wait til you hear her. She's doing great!\" Don assured, causing the child to beam more than she already was. \"Of course. Go ahead, Annie, show ol' Cos what you got,\" he said excitedly. The professor knelled and said, \"Okay Annie, repeat after me: Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed.\" Annie repeated, coming close to sounding like an American child. \"Marvelous! Well done!\" the men applauded, and she hugged Cosmo around the waist. \"Now you, Mr. Lockwood.\" After just one mispronunciation, the professor and Cosmo both corrected Don's 'snipped' to 'sipped', and just by the way he did so Annie and Don could tell Cosmo was mocking him. It became more evident when the professor began an alliteration about Moses—as he spoke, Cosmo made ridiculous faces, and when the professor would face him, he would appear normal. Chuckles from Annie and even Don were silenced until the professor caught a face. Annie burst out in giggles, and the professor, obviously unamused, thrust the book into Don's hand for him to repeat. \"Moses supposes his toeses are roses, but Moses supposes erroneously..\" \"But,\" Cosmo intervened, \"Moses, he knowses his toeses aren't roses, as Moses supposes his toeses to be.\" He added a beat, and Don, catching on, recited it again with him. \"Oh, boy,\" Annie muttered, feeling the song coming on, and on it came as the two sang about roses and Moses and danced on chairs and the desk. While the confusion was going on, Annie grabbed the yellow alliteration book, ran outside to Cosmo's car, stuck it under the passenger's seat, and ran back inside in time to see Cosmo and Don throwing things on the professor, and singing \"AAAAA!\" as a poster they held showed. She laughed, and soon found herself hoisted up by Cosmo and had a raspberry blown in her cheek. The surprise attack caught her off guard, and yet another laughing fit was produced. \"Ah ha! I found it! The cure for sour faces, Don!\" Cosmo announced as the men made it back to their cars. \"Wish you woulda found that sooner. That's the most she's smiled all day.\" Don commented. \"Ah, she's just gotta get used to ya, that's all.\" They parted, Annie actually hugging Don before climbing into the car, and off each drove to their own homes. Once Cosmo and Annie made it home, after a drive of listening to Annie attempt to correct her speech, they got out, and made their way inside. \"Now wait Annie. Before you do anything else, I got something to show ya,\" Cosmo said, with a hint of excitement in his voice. Annie was puzzled, but followed her uncle up the stairs and was surprised that he took a left instead of a right, to his room. \"What room is this, Uncle Cosmo?\" Annie asked innocently. \"Well, it was a spare room. Now...\" he said, opening the door to a bright white room with a red-violet carpet. There was a new bed, one of her size, with a comforter and curtains on the window that matched the carpet. There was also a wooden nightstand next to her bed, and a dresser. Annie was stunned silent, and looked back up to Cosmo, with a winning grin, and he finished, \"...now, it's your room.\" \"But... but...\" she stammered, and her uncle knowingly answered, \"I told you I had some errands to run. And that's not all,\" he said. \"W-What?\" she stuttered. \"Yes, look here,\" he said, motioning to sit on the small bed. He pulled a black folder from a briefcase that Annie barely acknowledged in the first place. He showed her a diploma and a contract, reading the most important parts of them to her. He didn't expect her to understand much of it, so when she asked, \"What does it mean?\" He was more than happy to reply, \"It means now I'm your guardian. By law. No one can take you away from here.\"[Chapter 4] I decided to add a bit of Italian in this one, since that would be Annie's native tongue. Don't worry-I don't speak Italian either-there are translations at the bottom. Other than that, Chapter four, enjoy. Reviews welcome, let me know how it's going :) As time passed, Cosmo and Annie became quite the pair. She usually didn't leave his side—only to be with Don or Kathy once in a while, when Cosmo decided he needed a break from guardianship, but that didn't occur very often. Annie also became pretty famous in the studio—so much so that R.F. wanted to place her in a film with Kathy, if she, Don, and Cosmo were willing to train her. \"Wow R.F., you mean it?\" Cosmo asked when the idea was proposed. \"Of course. She's speaking much better, as far as I'm concerned. I think she would be the perfect child sister of Seldon in her next picture.\" R.F. replied. \"She just has to learn the acting ropes.\" \"That'll be a sinch, R.F. Annie will be ready for the stage in no time,\" Don chimed in. \"The next Ethel Barrymore,\" Kathy added. Annie only smiled and nodded. \"Good. Now then, Don, you go get dressed for The Dueling Cavalier . Cosmo, get ready for the musical number.\" R.F. stated, and stormed off to another set in the studio. The group split and did as they were told. While Cosmo was searching for his briefcase, which Annie had hidden in plain sight by his piano, she discovered the room which held several hundred instruments, and was excited when she found a lonely looking violin. She picked up and examined it, but jumped when she heard her uncle's voice, followed by the opening of the door. \"Annabelle, where did you put-\" he stopped, and saw her clutching the instrument. Instead of ordering her to put it down, he smiled, and was curious. \"Say, whatcha got there, kid?\" \"Un violin,\" she answered naturally. Cosmo looked to her, being the first time she spoke her native language to him, and made a mental note to take up some Italian. He then asked, \"What for?\" \"I love this instrument, Uncle Cosmo. I played very well for my family and guests in Venice.\" He was astonished. \"I sure would like to hear what ya got.\" He encouraged. She beamed, then put on a serious face, that of an artist at work, and played a bit of a composition she knew very well—The Surprise Symphony by Hyden. When she finished, Cosmo applauded. \"Bravo, Annie! Why didn't you tell me you could play?\" \"I didn't think you would be interested.\" Cosmo stared at her blankly, and she smirked and shrugged. \"You didn't think that I, a musical director and a pianist, would be interested if my niece had musical talent?\" She shrugged again as a reply. \"You silly thing, you!\" he exclaimed, quickly hoisting her up and blew raspberries on her neck and cheek. She squealed and giggled, until she saw Don Lockwood standing at the door. \"Uncle Don!\" she yelped, and Cosmo quickly turned around. \"Stop tormenting the poor girl, Cos, and let's get this over with,\" said Don, amused with his friends at play but really dreading working with Lina. \"You got it, Don. By the way, Annie, you read music, right?\" Cosmo asked. \"Of course.\" \"Then grab that violin. I want you to perform with me.\" Her eyes widened and she beamed again, grabbing the instrument and almost running out the door. Once on the set, Lina came out of her dressing room in her aristocratic French outfit, and began complaining of the style. She then noticed Don and Cosmo walk in, followed by Annie and the violin. \"What's the big idea here? You can't let this brat practice during my picture!\" she yelled. Annie grew angry, but Cosmo spoke calmly to Lina. \"She's not practicing, Lina, she's playing. She happens to be a professional.\" \"What am I, dumb or somethin'? Kids are professional pains in the butt, that's what they are!\" Annie had heard enough. \"I have more talent with a bow alone than you do in your whole body!\" Everyone froze, including Cosmo. Lina walked over, and got in her face. \"What did you say to me?!\" \"You heard. I was speaking English, after all.\" Annie replied as-a-matter-of-factly, then added a string of Italian, which wasn't clear to anyone but they all had a feeling it was an insult. To finish, Annie spit, not on Lina, but in her direction, and took her place with the other violin players. Lina was speechless until their director Dexter came out and told everyone to get to their places. \"Not 'til that rat is out of the picture!\" Lina hollered. Dexter looked to Cosmo. \"Take her out.\" \"But Dexter-\" \"Take. Her. Out,\" Dexter repeated, with more aggravation. The pianist sighed, and asked Annie to give him her violin and to sit with him on the piano. \"But Uncle Cosmo-\" \"Come on, Annie, we don't have time to argue.\" He said, clearly upset by the whole confrontation. He had no idea Annie had that kind of spunk, but she did as she was told, and remained silent with her back turned during the rehearsal. She did happen to see R.F. walk in, however, and he tripped on the wire that was hooked onto Lina's microphone, which was hidden on her shoulder. A stagehand tried to tell him to stay quiet, but he was more worried about the cord. \"Someone's going to get hurt on this thing!\" he said in a commanding voice, and yanked on the cord. Annie turned quickly to see Lina forcibly fall off the bench she was sitting on, and it took a lot for the small Italian child to keep her giggles to herself. Cosmo heard, and turned to give her a serious look. She stopped laughing, until Cosmo said, \"Serves her right,\" then they both had to cover their mouths from laughter. Since Dexter had a total breakdown after what seemed like the fiftieth failure, production stopped for the day. Annie waited patiently as Cosmo gathered his belongings, and didn't see Don walk quickly behind her and cover her eyes. She jumped slightly, then smiled when she felt his hands and giggled, \"Don!\" \"Hey, how'd you know?\" \"Because uncle Cosmo is over there and Kathy's hands aren't big or hairy.\" She said simply, causing Kathy and Cosmo to laugh and Don pretended to be offended. \"Well, maybe I should use my big, hairy hands to take this back to the orchestra,\" Don taunted, and revealed the violin that was taken off Annie earlier. Annie's eyes brightened, and Cosmo stepped in. \"Hang on a minute, Don, how-\" \"I'm sure they aren't going to miss one violin, are they, Annie?\" \"Please let me borrow it, uncle Cosmo! I promise to return it! *Abbastanza per favore!?\" The always theatrical Cosmo crossed his arms and hummed, \"Hmmm… I don't know…\" Annie proceeded to fold her hands and let petty tears build in her eyes. Cosmo, being somewhat of a sucker, broke. \"Yes, okay, you can use it, just quit with the face!\" Annie beamed and hugged her uncle tightly around the waist and she wiped off her fake tears. Cosmo shook his head, and said, \"What a ham,\" as he followed the group outside. \"Oh Don, we're still on for Annie's acting lesson tonight, right?\" Cosmo asked. \"Sure. Just make sure Annie brings her violin… And you make sure you bring Annie,\" Don added jokingly. \"Thanks for reminding me Don, I might have forgot,\" Cosmo replied sarcastically, and drove off to his house. \"Now Annie, acting is a lot like playing pretend, or something like that. If your character is upset, then pretend you want something from me and cry,\" Cosmo joked, and Annie laughed. \"If your character is mad, think about Lina,\" he added and Annie laughed again. \"If your character-,\" \"Red light!\" Annie yelped, and made Cosmo hit the brakes. \"Whew! Good call Annie. I should be paying more atten-,\" he stopped himself as he noticed the yellow book that slid out from under the passenger seat. Annie looked too, and blushed slightly. The light turned green and Cosmo drove, not speaking again until they were home. When they pulled up, he turned his attention to her and asked, \"Miss Annabelle, what might that be?\" She was quiet for a moment. \"Well?\" \"Would you believe me if I said it was my journal?\" \"No.\" \"Santa came early?\" \"Try again.\" \"All right, you win. I am an award winning author and this is a hard copy of my new book. No one is supposed to know.\" If Cosmo knew one thing about disciplining a child, he knew you really shouldn't laugh at them. But, being Annie has adopted his sense of humor, he couldn't help but chuckle as he shook his head, and got out of the car. He said nothing more as he gathered his things and the two went inside. His silence was rare, and it made Annie nervous. Once they were settled, he finally asked, \"Annabelle, you know stealing is bad. Why would you take this from your coach?\" Annie looked down and sighed, then looked up to her guardian and replied, \"Well, everyone wanted my accent to go away so bad. I thought if I could practice at home, it would go away faster.\" Now it was Cosmo's turn to feel guilty. She had been pushed hard to be rid of her accent for the business—a business that she wasn't even sure she wanted to be a part of yet. He sighed, and led Annie to the couch, and he said, \"I'm sorry we pushed ya so hard, kid. We just got caught up, I guess. We knew you had potential. Not too many child stars walk in to R.F.'s office, but I didn't even ask if it was what you wanted like I should've.\" Annie instinctively climbed on her uncle's lap, and he grinned, wrapping an arm around her. \"I do want to be in a picture with Kathy. As long as Lina isn't there.\" This made Cosmo laugh, and reminded him about earlier. \"Oh yeah, I wanted to ask ya—what was it you said to Lina earlier?\" Annie, assuming she had forgotten, gave her uncle a blank stare. Then her eyes widened in remembering and she laughed, trying to cover up her giggles with her hands. Cosmo now was giving her a playful stare, the one that told her what fate she would have if she didn't talk. \"What's so funny?\" \"I can't say,\" she replied through an ornery grin. \"Annabelle, what did you say?\" \"Lei non saprebbe che agisce se lei sapeva in faccia.\" \"In English, kid!\" \"**Lo non parlo inglese.\" \"What?\" Cosmo exclaimed out of utter confusion, unable to understand anything as Annie laughed, giving the impression that she was mocking him. \"Annie, in English, what did you say?\" \"***Non lo so!\" she defended through stifled laughter. \"All right, come 'ere!\" he exclaimed, purposely giving her time to jump off his lap and they ran through the house. Annie, trying to control her laughter to run, was trying to avoid her uncle's 'lethal' grip. \"I'll give you something to laugh about, kid!\" The girl dodged all the way to her room, and turned to lock the door. That is when she came to a terrible discovery—her door doesn't lock. She tried and failed miserably to hold the door shut, as Cosmo was clearly much stronger than she was. He opened the door and she shrieked, \"No no no!\" as she heard it from the movie. \"Yes yes YES!\" Cosmo bellowed evilly, and lifted her over his shoulder. He spun before collapsing on her bed, causing the girl to turn pink with laughter. Cosmo had been laughing too, but that didn't stop him from standing and pinning Annabelle to her bed. \"Last chance, Annie, before you get the Italian and the English tickled right out of ya!\" Annie stiffened in defense, knowing very well Cosmo wouldn't hesitate, and finally spoke. \"Okay, okay! I told Lina she wouldn't know acting if it smacked her in the face!\" He sighed in relief somewhat, expecting something much worse, but gave her another look. \"That's all you said? Honest?\" he interrogated, lightly scratching her belly, causing her to squirm and giggle but still able to speak. \"Heehee, honest!\" Cosmo stopped and, again, when he wasn't supposed to laugh, chuckled heartily and added, \"Well, you're not far from the truth now, are ya?\" She shrugged. \"But really, a young lady shouldn't say things like that to other people, even if they can't understand.\" She was permitted to sit up, and she was suddenly serious. \"But uncle Cosmo, she always yells at you and she calls me a lot of things.\" \"I know Annie. But if you can manage to ignore her, you'll be the better person.\" Annie stared for a moment, than replied, \"That's no fun...\" Cosmo had to laugh again. He realized how much she was becoming like him… Which, once he thought about it, was kind of scary, and felt compelled to ask, \"Annie, where did you learn to speak that way?\" She stared a moment, then smiled. \"I've been speaking Italian my entire life, uncle Cosmo.\" He gave her yet another blank stare, squeezed her sides, knowing it makes her double-over in laughter, and said \"I mean , where did you learn those insults?\" He stopped, and as she regained her breath she began to frown, and answered, \"Home.\" \"I see,\" Cosmo commented, relieved that she hadn't heard him deliver the insults he sometimes does under his breath when he drives, or when Lina stresses him out. \"Why would your parents ever say things like that?\" \"Well… Sometimes they fought… And yelled… And broke things…\" \"Did you ever get hurt!?\" Cosmo asked on impulse. \"No no, my nanny always took me away when they began fighting. Anywhere out of the house,\" Annie said, and looked to her new guardian and was able to smile. \"But I'm not afraid anymore. You are my guardian, and you won't hurt me, I know.\" Cosmo smiled back at her. \"Course not. Who could hurt such a pretty little face?\" he cooed, gently pinching both of her cheeks, well aware it was a peeve of hers. \"Ack! Stop it!\" The girl yelped, swatting his hands away. \"Is this any better?\" he asked, and took the opportunity to swipe his fingers on her neck, producing a new fit of giggles and lightened Annie's mood. The girl quickly stood and retaliated by squeezing her uncle's knees, a recently found weakness of his. Cosmo, not expecting the assault, laughed loudly and took her wrists. \"Why you little—\" he started, and had a dangerous look on his face, but the phone interrupted his revenge. \"Hello?\" he answered normally, as if nothing happened. \"Hey Cos, it's Don. We're all set for Annie's lesson.\" \"Okay Don, we're on our way,\" Cosmo replied, and hung up. \"Come on, Annie. I kind of forgot about your lesson with Don and Kathy.\" He said, and she looked to him and chuckled. They walked out to the car and Cosmo opened the door, just as a butler would, and said fancily, \"After you, Miss Barrymore.\" She curtsied and got in with a mock I'm-incredibly-famous attitude. \"To Don Lockwood's manor, driver,\" she \"commanded\", and off they drove.

He actually drooled at the site of the shelled 'monster\",nhis tongue wiping his teeth. Leechra had red skin and a long snout,nhis body covered in black robes. Long agonhe had come down here, driven the giant known as Gamera. How henlonged to see the creature helpless, his jaws around his neck. Yes,nhe was human-sized, but he had a special power, which he would soonnuse if things turned out a certain way. A hunchbacked, green-skinnedncreature with an elephantine nose came into the room. \"Whatnare you planning to do, Lord Leechra?\" \"Gamera'snblood… it's radiated. And that means I must drink it.\" \"Whynmust it be radiated?\" \"Becausenif I drink radiated blood, I can become more powerful. But I mustntire him out before I attack him. Come, Vrimzauld. I must show you myncloning chambers.\" Vrimzauldnfollowed Leechra into a large chamber full of large creatures. \"Here Inhave cloned all of Gamera's foes; the ones that battled him priornto 1975. Thanks to mind-controlling gear in my computer lab, I shouldnbe able to send each monster against the turtle one at a time, fromnearliest to latest, with their hatred for this planet's defendernstill intact. If Gamera is killed before I can meet him, I will notnbe disappointed. After all, it was he who trapped us under thenearth's surface!\" \"Whennwill you strike?\" \"Now,nwhile Gamera is on the west coast of America and rather very close tonus.\" SannFrancisco during the Night Gameranflew above the California city, performing aerial tricks for hisnnight-time admirers below. He loved people and people loved him,nmeaning he was one very lucky turtle. The gigantic superhero flewnupside-down, only using one of his jets which fired out of hisnleg-holes. He finally landed by a lake, opening his mouth andndrinking some fresh water. He was quickly satisfied, although thenmangers of the lake were displeased when a third of the water wasngone. Thenturtle was having a good month. No monsters, no aliens, and fewnnatural disasters. He even raised some money for charity by givingnpeople some rides on his back. He was as smart as any human. Henremembered when he had changed from a little turtle into a gargantuanncreature. He had been confused then, destroying buildings andnbattling the military. Now he was an admired hero of the billions whonpopulated this world. Gameransuddenly smelled something… something ominous. Did he just feel thenground shaking? He roared a warning to the Californians and wentnabout to saving them from the earthquake, but it was no earthquake.nYes, a chasm did appear in the ground, but it was really the entrancenof Barugon, another giant reptile. The four-legged abomination roarednand then charged, hitting Gamera with his horn. Thenheroic turtle went sailing through the air, landing on his face.nGetting up, he whirled around and fired his famous hot breath, justnin time to stop Barugon's freezing beam with it. As steam fillednthe sky, Gamera jumped towards his foe, punching him with his rightnhand. Barugon grabbed him and the two rolled towards the lake. That'snwhen Gamera remembered that his enemy's weakness was H20. He stillnrolled around with his sparring partner and soon they hit the lake,nwith Barugon weakening. The quadruped weakened and was punched intonthe bottom of the lake, dying from both heavy battering and clearnliquids. Leechra'snLair \"Curses,nmy Barugon clone must have had problems while being raised! Henshouldn't have been this weak. Well, it does not matter. Gameranstill has many foes to go up against!\" On thenmain computer screen, Gayos, a winged monstrosity with a sonic beam,ncould be seen clawing at Gamera's face. Vrimzauld stepped closer tonLeechra with an inquisitive look. \"Mynlord, how did Gamera send us down here?\" I wasntrying to take over a city in the state of New Mexico when thenaccursed turtle came and squashed my forces. That was thirty-fivenyears ago, when you were a grub. But forget the past and watch asnGamera is exhausted.\" SannFrancisco Gameranwas surprised when he saw Barugon, especially since he was supposednto be dead. But now Gayos had also come. Where were they coming from?nGamera punched his winged foe and breathed his destructive flame.nGayos dodged. He had been winning, giving Gamera nasty cuts with hisnsonic beam. An eerie sound was heard as a thin, yellow laser came outnof his mouth and hit his turtle-foe's arm, slicing the skin open.nScreaming in pain, Gamera put his legs into his shell and activatednhis rear jets. He flewnupwards towards Gayos, whacking the sonic monster out of the air.nAfter wiping some blue blood off of his face, the reptile landed onnfour legs, jumping forward and biting his enemy's throat. Thenwinged reptile hit him with one of his wings, sending him back. Toonbad this was going on during the night, because daylight could weakennGayos. Gamera jumped again, landing behind his enemy and speedilyngrabbing him from behind. He smashed the monster's head into thenground a few times and then threw the body into the nearby ocean.nGayos was too beaten to continue the battle. Just whennhe thought it was all over, Gamera was hit from behind. His mindnreeled as he landed on his side. He looked up to see Viras, anothernmonster that was supposed to have been killed years ago. Before thententacled creature could hit him again with his sharp head, Gameranstepped to the side and punched the alien in the side. Viras shriekednas he fell onto the ground. While the original was being cloned,nLeechra had taken the precaution of taking away some of his new pet'snintelligence. Now the space squid was on the same level as Gayos andnBarugon. Gamerangrabbed Viras by the tentacles, repeatedly slamming him into thenCalifornia ground. The alien retaliated by hitting him with antentacle and both behemoths started flying, trying to drop each othernout of the sky. Gamera punched Viras in the eye and the giant squidnheadbutted him back. Soon Gamera was hanging on to his opponent'sntentacles. Viras stopped his flight and the two giants crashed intonthe ground below. They were now near a valley. Viras wasnchoking and battering the turtle with his tentacles, cackling withnevil laughter. Gamera frothed at the mouth and his limbs flailed. Henthought he was helpless. The alien lifted the reptile into the airnand then slammed him back down. The turtle then formulated a plan. Hentook advantage of the tentacles and used them to flip his enemy intona pile of boulders. Viras screeched as he lost his grip. Gamerangrabbed a boulder and slammed it into his foe's beaked mouth. Henthen kicked him through the air and turned his fiery breath on.nViras's body was engulfed in flames. With his intelligencenlessened, he had been unable to beat the defender of earth. Gameranprepared for any other assault by one of his \"deceased\" enemies.nHis wait was short and Guiron, a four-legged fiend resembling anknife, walked towards him. Leechra'snLair \"Dawnnis coming and there are still three monsters before I arrive. Revengenwill be mine!\" Vrimzauldnonce again asked a question. 'LordnLeechra, how did you manage to find these monsters and clone them?\" \"I cannanswer that, my servant. I managed to get above the surface in 1972,nwhen I learned of Gamera's latest exploits. I traveled throughnspace and underwater with one of my inventions and found the rottingncarcasses of many monstrosities. By using what was left of their DNA,nI managed to recreate them, although I had to put restrictions on thenintelligence of Viras and Zigra in order to control them. Oh, I wishnI could taste Gamera's blood right now.\" Vrimzauldnlooked away from his master and watched the ongoing battle. Guironnhad become much more athletic and was giving Gamera a good fight. Thenturtle had tried to repeat his stick-the-living-horn-into-the-groundntrick, but the space creature had become more agile and escaped whilenknocking over his opponent. AnCalifornia Valley Gameranand Guiron were fighting amidst a chemical plant and by a largenvalley. Gamera was getting tired and Guiron's trying to chop him upnwasn't exactly helping things. The heroic turtle was still healingnfrom wounds inflicted by Gayos. His ginsu knife foe batted him withnthe side of his horn, knocking him into the valley. After somenrolling, Gamera put his head, arms, tail, and legs into his shell andnstarted spinning, going into the grey dawn sky. Guironnwas fast, but not fast enough to avoid getting hit by the flyingnturtle shell. Gamera landed and his head and limbs came out of hisnprotective covering. As his enemy from Jupiter shook off some dirt,nhe got an idea. Grabbing a large container of blue liquid in hisnmouth, he rushed towards the other combatant on his four legs. Guironnbraced himself. Gameranpurposely slowed down a little, enabling Guiron to rush to the sidenof his assailant and swing his horn downwards. When he had made hisnswift chop, the space reptile walked up to his defeated foe to seenhis head chopped off, blue blood staining the vegetation. Guiron hadnbeaten Gamera! Then a head popped out and before the villainous giantncould do anything flame hit his face, causing him to run away innagony. Gameranthumped his chest. His cleverness had enabled him to defeat one ofnhis most dangerous foes in a fairly short time. Now he would searchnfor the next monstrosity, who like the others would probably be sentnby some villain manipulating him from behind the scenes. Since thenenormous creatures had been coming in chronological order, Jigernwould probably be next. The turtle sneakily crawled along somenridges, trying to stay as concealed as possible. Gamerantried not to breathe too heavily from exhaustion as he watched outnfor Jiger. He soon saw the squat, tusked monster lumbering along,nunaware of him. Hiding inside his shell, Gamera got onto his side andnstarted rolling like a wheel. He slammed into Jiger's side, sendingnthe bulky abomination flying. Jiger was probably the dumbest of thengiant menaces which wreaked havoc on the world. Jiger gotnback onto his feet, roaring in anger. He fired his oversized heatnray, which hit Gamera. The turtle felt like he was being burned alivenand he released his own fire. Red and orange flame hit the villainousngiant, causing him to step back. Gamera fired again and this time anburn mark appeared below Jiger's left eye. Both reptiles chargedneach other and became engaged in a savage brawl. Daylightnhad come and the sun shone upon the two battling behemoths. Gameranand Jiger bit, scratched, and rammed each other for almost threenminutes. Gamera was really starting to feel exhausted and beaten asnmore wounds were made on his scaly body. Jiger also suffered somennasty blows, but he was still fairly fresh. He swung his head at hisnturtle-foe and nearly cut one of his eyes out with his tusks. Gameranused his own tusks and teeth to bite his opponent's neck. Bellowingnin pain, Jiger fired some spikes from his head, hitting the otherncombatant at the shoulder. Thentitanic superhero let go of his enemy and received a headbutt thatnsent him rolling onto his back. What happened next would never havenoccurred if Jiger wasn't so dimwitted. The gluttonous animal walkednup to his \"helpless\" enemy and decided it would be fun to eat hisnlegs. But Gamera just put his lower limbs into his shell and hisnrockets went on, blasting Jiger's head. The fatnfiend rolled on the ground, making obnoxious sounds. Gamera landed bynhim and tore into him, pounding him with his fists. Jiger retaliatednby shooting a spike into the hero's left hand. The turtle roared innpain and anger as he pulled out the spike and stabbed his opponent innthe side. Then he grabbed the chubby monstrosity by the bottom andnlifted him over his head. Gameranthrew Jiger onto the highway and almost broke out in laughter whennthe squat villain had a hard time getting back onto his feet. Jigernwas now very angry and he fired his heat beam, burning up some treesnand causing Gamera to topple. He then ran as fast as he could,nhitting the turtle with the side of his head. Gameranwas on the verge of collapsing, but he still fought on. Grabbing thenother reptile, he quickly flipped him over his head and Jiger landednon his back, pretty much beaten. After firing an inferno of flame atnJiger, Gamera decided to get some rest. Leechra'snLair \"Gameranis starting to rest. I must not allow that! I'll just throw thisnswitch and watch as Gamera falls into a large hole that will formnvery quickly. Then water will come into the hole and Zigra will be innhis home environment!\" Leechranthrew the switch and laughed as the earth beneath Gamera fell. Thennwater came into the hole, along with the shark-like monstrosity knownnas Zigra. California Zigranroared before he fired a laser. Gamera was hit in the head and soonnhe was being pulled under the water by his aquatic enemy. Zigra heldnhim onto the bottom of the ocean and the turtle started wriggling,nlacking air. He scraped at the bottom of the gigantic waterhole,nfiring his breath uselessly. Fire didn't work out well underwater. Thenreptile was as good as dead. Leechra'snLair \"I'venwaited for years to see Gamera die, but now I have changed my mind. I will confront the beast and destroy him myself. Vrimzauld, press thengreen button on your right!\" The weirdncreature did as he was told and Zigra screeched in pain as henexploded, his insides being splattered around the Leechra-made lake. \"Now Inshall get out of this room! Don't follow, Vrimzauld, lest you benkilled!\" Leechranspent a few minutes walking to a more abandoned spot of his kingdom,ngoing as fast as he could. Every minute he spent getting ready was anminute that Gamera could use to regain his strength. Leechranstretched out his arms and yelled out one word. \"BLOODTHIRST!\" He gotnbigger and bigger until he was as large as the turtle that he hatednso much. He was more leech-like, for he is named after thenblood-sucking creature found in many places around the world. He madena loud screech and made a fantastic leap. Gamera's blood would benhis.

Thank you.[Chapter 2] Gameranvs. Leechra Partn2 By RaynBattlemonger Leechranwas disgusting and horrific. He had a pink and red body that wasnacross between a leech and a dinosaur. His eyes were flaming red andnhis mouth was beaked, his tongue having a sucker at the tip. Stickingnout of his body were ten winding tentacles with bloodsuckingnapparatuses at the ends. The tail was hideous, having a gooey stingernat the end of it. The wings were like those of a demon you might seenin an old painting. Leechra was out for blood. In hisngiant size, he was almost incapable of human speech. He hissed andnshrieked as he spoke, only being able to make an occasional wordnrecognizable. The winged leech mutation circled over the dead, burntnbody of Viras. He landed on it and looked for any additional aliennblood that might still be left. He pressed his mouth against thensmoldering head and stuck five of his tentacles into random parts ofnthe alien squid. He feasted on what little blood there was, feelingnmore energy come into him. He ended his snack and flew off fornGamera. Leechra'snLair Vrimzauldnwatched the screens in front of him with anticipation. Gamera hadnbeen waiting for another monster foe near a small town, suspiciousndue to Zigra's unexplained explosion. Finally the turtle laid downnfor rest, although he was still a little cautious. Vrimzauld wasngladdened when he saw Leechra descend on the sleeping reptile. Woodland Gamera'sneyes shot open. He saw a red, pink, and orange nightmare descendingnon him. He rolled out of the way as Leechra hit the ground. Thenvillain produced a series of shrieks and hisses, the only audiblenword being \"DIE!\" Gamera noticed something familiar about his newnenemy, but he put aside all thinking and went into a vicious charge,nsnapping his jaws shut on one of Leechra's tentacles. Thenmonster shrieked and tried to pull away his sucking extension. Gamerantore off the tentacle with his teeth and spit it out, firing hisnatomic breath at one of Leechra's horrendous wings. The abominationnhissed in pain as he fell over, his wing seared. Gamera leapt ontonhim and started clawing, making scratch marks in his slimy hide.nGamera then grabbed him by the tail and swung him, throwing him intona hillside. Phase onenof the battle belonged to Gamera, who cheered in his language. Gameranwas going to use his fiery breath as a finale, but suddenly flamingnelectricity came out of Leechra's eyes, hitting the hero in thenchest. Before the turtle could recover from the barrage, his fiendishnfoe was upon him, kicking him and squeezing his forelegs with somententacles. Leechra threw the turtle, watching him soar through thenair and hit two hotels. He then flew towards the good guy, firingnmore volts of electricity. Gamera's body sparked from the voltagenand he shrieked as bits of shell and scales ripped off. Leechra endednhis turtle-bashing by kicking the shelled reptile in the tail. Leechranwon phase two. Using hisntentacles to secure the turtle's limbs, he dragged himnunceremoniously near his gaping jaw, his bloodsucking tongue ready.nHe lifted up Gamera with his tentacles and wiped the turtle's facenwith his tongue, previous to latching it onto his throat. Just as theneating and drinking was about to begin, the gargantuan superheronkicked free of a couple of tentacles and used his free foot to kicknthe slimy and blubbery hide. Leechra'snugly hide shook from the impact and his grip loosened. Gamera managednto get all of his limbs into action, kicking Leechra's stomachnwhile grabbing and clawing his tongue. The monstrous villain couldntake it no longer. He pulled his tongue back into his mouth whilenusing his more saurian arms to grab the turtle's legs and flip himnonto his back. He then stomped on Gamera's chest. Gameranreleased the fury of his fiery breath and blackened one of thententacles. Leechra stepped back, receiving another burst of flame onnthe same spot. The tentacles started to go on fire and he had nonchoice but to cut it off himself before Gamera charged into him. Henused two of his other tentacles to rip it off and he used it like anflaming whip to keep the turtle back while he formulated a plan ofnaction. Leechra'snLair \"Quickly,nmaster! You must destroy our surface enemy!\" Vrimzauldncheered on his ruler, although he couldn't possibly hear him. Hengrabbed a sludgy beverage and drank it, waiting for the next blows toncome. Nearnthe Small Town Leechranfinally decided to choke his foe into unconsciousness. He wound thenbroken off tentacle around the turtle, putting his feet on his backnand pulling. Gamera simply slashed away at the dismembered appendage,nflipping onto his back to knock the wind out of Leechra, He then gotnonto his forelegs, putting his hindlegs inside his shell and startingnup his rockets. Leechra received a burst of flame as the rockets hitnhim, just prior to Gamera taking off. Leechranalso started taking to the air. Gamera went into full saucer mode,nbeing chased around by his disgusting opponent. Leechra released anbarrage of electricity which caused flakes of shell to fill parts ofnthe sky, yet Gamera still flew. The two behemoths landed, with Gameranstill inside his shell. The enormous animal went on his side, rollingntowards a turning Leechra. The horrendous nightmare was hit by thenrolling shell, getting knocked back. The wicked bloodsucker got up asnGamera rolled towards him again. This time he caught the superhero'snshell with his tentacles and threw him like a Frisbee, smashing upnover twenty blocks of houses. Angerednat the destruction his enemy just caused, Gamera got his head andnlimbs outside of his shell and emitted his flaming breath, hittingnLeechra in one of his weakened tentacles. The tentacle flew off,ndripping red and black slime behind it. Gamera charged on all foursnin a berserk phase. He collided with a counterattacking Leechra andnthe two monsters got into an on-the-ground brawl, rolling, biting,npunching, and scratching Leechrantried to suck out Gamera's blood with one of his tentacles, butninstead digested a large ball of dirt and earth. He had to disconnectnhe choking tentacle, so he tore it off and quickly lashed Gamera legsntogether. Gamera socked Leechra in the jaw, just prior to beingnlifted by his bound legs and thrown into the air. The mass of scalesnand shell soared through the air until he fell on a highway, whichncollapsed under his weight. He got rid of the slimy tentacle aroundnhis leg just in time to avoid a stomping landing by his unearthlynfoe. Thenvillainous scumbag let out a few shrieks and Gamera replied with hisnfamous roar. The two titans both got each other on the left shouldernwith their massive maws, but Leechra had the advantage. He used hisnblood-draining tongue on the turtle's shoulder, getting a fewngallons of \"delicious\" red drink. Gamera sickened at the sightnand before anything too serious could happen to him, he bit harderninto the other combatant's shoulder, forcing him to let go. Clutchingnhis shoulder in pain, he released a stream of fire, causing sparks tonfly off one of Leechra's wings. The maniacal creature hissed beforenhe leaped onto Gamera, only to get grabbed by the legs and thrownnonto his back. Gamera punched him, and was then kicked. His shellnprotected him from pain, but the force of the blow sent him sailingnthrough the sky. Leechra decided to have more fun so he flew over tonthe stunned turtle, picked him up, and flew as fast as he could. A FewnMinutes Later above Los Angeles Gameranhad struggled with the monstrosity that had been holding him, but hencouldn't break free. Finally he was dropped onto a hospital andncars, people, and debris flew all over the city. Gamera got up innfrustration. People everywhere were fleeing for shelter. Leechranunleashed a barrage of electricity, blasting apart severalnskyscrapers. Gamera put his hindlegs inside his shell and activatednhis rockets, concealing his head. He rammed into the flying Leechra,nbringing both back down to earth. The turtle hated damaging the city,nbut he had no choice. He grabbed Leechra by his tail and slammed himninto the ground several times before getting hit by one of thententacles' suckers. Leechranand Gamera did some more tussling before the cruel, reddish creaturenrevealed the one weapon he hadn't used. He flung his gooey tail atnGamera, who used his shell to shield himself. The spiked appendagenonly made a small nook in the shell and Leechra pulled it out, usingnhis bodily weapon to take the brunt of a fiery attack from Gamera.nThe bloodsucking creature then used his tail again, this time makingna gash on his turtle-foe's face. Red bloodncovered one of Gamera's eyes, screwing up the reptile's sight.nAfter two more gashes from the tail, he felt Leechra's sick tonguencatch his right foreleg, a.k.a. right arm. He felt his life goingnaway, squirming among the tentacles that held him. He had to think ofnsomething… fast. Leechra'snLair Vrimzauldnwas annoyed. He had to find the code for the hidden cameras showingnthe battle in Los Angeles, since the combatants had flown out of thenprevious battle site. Vrimzauld found the codes giving him views ofnChicago, Mexico City, and Denver, but still no Los Angeles. He hissednand gurgled until he finally found what he wanted. Leechra wasnthrashing Gamera with his tail. Vrimzauldnwas pleased. His master was coming close to defeating the turtle. Henbecame even more filled with wicked joy when Gamera was entwined innLeechra's tentacles, the bloodsucking creature's tongue attachingnto one of his arms. \"Maynyou win, master, so that the surface of North America may fall beforenus.\" Vrimzauldnlooked closer at the screen as he saw Gamera struggle in pain. LosnAngeles Twontentacles held each of Gamera's hindlegs, while one tentaclengrabbed each foreleg. Another tentacle slithered around his neck,ndisabling him from using his fire breath. Another battered him,nwhacking him in the head and on the shell. Leechra's tongue wasnsucking out more blood and Gamera was losing health. But he was anclever turtle, so he formulated a plan. He purposely struggled bynshaking left and right, letting the rim of his shell, which he hadnrecently discovered to be quite sharp, to gradually cut away at thententacles. He alsonextended his neck as far as he could, getting hit by Leechra'snbattering tentacle. He still persevered, getting his tusks into onenof the winding appendages holding him. He then bit down, causing onenof his arms to be free. He then tensed up while using his free arm tonslash Leechra across the face. The battering tentacle hit the tensednup body and shell of Gamera, and its wielder's eyes widened innpain, its grip on the reptile loosening. Gamera thrashed wildly,nfreeing himself, and then delivered a salvo of flame, making smallnholes in Leechra's right wing. Thenturtle panted. He needed to recover due to having around two tons ofnblood drained away. Leechra had been going slow, trying to torturenhim. That was fortunate, for Gamera could have lost his life if thenvillain had done his deed faster. Gamera delivered another burst ofnflame, hitting Leechra's mouth. The shrieking abomination fell ontona parking lot, smashing over fifty cars. Gameranjumped onto his downed foe, biting on his neck. Leechra's fieryneyes emitted electricity, shocking the turtle into getting off ofnhim. He then got onto his feet and kicked the massive scaly hero innthe mouth, just before grabbing his neck with two tentacles andnswinging him into Los Angeles's already damaged skyline. Gamera wasnlet loose and he collided with some smaller buildings, sending themncrumbling. Leechranstarted hissing and shrieking again in his distorted language.n\"Blood!\" \"Death!\" He fired more electricity while letting outnan insidious laugh. Gamera yelled in pain as he was knocked throughnthe air by the force of his enemy's voltage. He fell onto a park,ndestroying the trees and playground. Leechra flew over shrieking,n\"Feast!\" Gameranwas knocked back by a barrage of tentacles. He was done for. He wasndefeated. All of his old foes had weakened him, preparing him for thenslaughter. His limbs were aching, his fire was exhausted, and bloodndripped from his mouth and right arm. Leechra stomped towards him andnthen paused a little. His saurian/leech mouth went into a cruel smilenas one of his tentacles grabbed a little boy who had accidentallynbeen left behind while the city was in panic. He screamed as Leechranwas about to have him as a little appetizer. Angernwelled up inside Gamera. In a flash he got onto his four legs and thenenergy of his fire was renewed. In one colossal display of fiery andnflame, he hit Leechra, blasting off most of the tentacles andndestroying the wings. Leechra's slimy body went on fire and henscreamed, dropping the boy. Gamera rushed forward and grabbed thenfalling kid, receiving a slash across the left cheek from his burningnenemy. He faced him and growled, then letting out his well-knownnroar. After blasting Leechra once again with fire breath, he let thenboy climb onto his back and then put his head, legs, and arms insidenhis shell. Blasting off, he spun in the sky while Leechra burned tondeath, never having felt the satisfaction of revenge. Leechra'snLair Vrimzauldnroared in anger. \"Curse Gamera! He has defeated the master and letnhim burn!\" He thennwent out of the room to tell everyone else what happened. Leechra'snKingdom Warnmachines that had been prepared for invasion were now left innstorage. Some of Leechra's most devoted followers, includingnVrimzauld, were angered at their master's death, but most of theninhabitants of the subterranean world were rejoicing at theirnliberation from a powerful tyrant. They praised Gamera and begannbuilding of a statue, giving him honor, though not worshipping him asna god, in their public square. LosnAngeles The headnof construction held his nose in disgust. \"What'snwith that smell? Why isn't that stinkin' carcass put away?\" \"Sorry,nsir, but even with much of its body burned away, the creature'sndead remains are still very heavy. We're doing our best to get ridnof him.\" \"Well,nhurry up and give him to the mad scientists. I wish Gamera would justndump his dead enemies into the ocean.\" AnnIsland in the Pacific Gameranwent onto the bed of vegetation that he had made. Going into hisnshell, he closed his eyes and prepared for a well-deserved night ofnsleep. He had almost faced death at the hands of Viras, Guiron,nZigra, and Leechra. He had won even though he was exhausted andnweakened. He then opened his eyes, seeing some small leeches crawlingnon the ground. He felt like burning them, but he decided to sparenthem, because they didn't have the evil heart of Leechra. Afternsome further thought, he started snoring. ThenEnd Sorrynit took so long for me to put in the second half. I hope that it isnworth it to those who were waiting. I've noticed that I've had anmajor part in restarting the Gamera section. There are already twonother stories. Here'sna note for DaiKaijuSummoner. No, I am not on a Kaiju forum, althoughnit might be fun if I was. Thanks. ","Summary":" Gameranvs. Leechra PartnI By RaynBattlemonger Andisgusting, furry man sat in a dark cave, which was"},{"Movie":"Gamera","Title":"Gamera 4: The Wrath of Garasharp","Author":"Kendell","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3838238","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok time for my first attempt at a Gamera fic. I'm truely surpised there aren't more Gamera fics, I'll have to try and get some of my friends over here. Incase you don't know, Garasharp was supposed to be in the seventh Gamera movie in the showa series before Daiei went bankrupt. Now I'm going to start off with the end of the Revenge of Iris with Gamera's final fight with the Gyaos swarm. I don't own Gamera, Gyaos, Garasharp, or related characters but I made Alpha Gyaos, sort of. Last Stand Kyoto, 12 pm; A Gyaos exploded into a fireball as Gamera and his human allies fought an all out war against the thousands of airborne kaiju. Gamera had just left Iris in pieces of burning flesh when the Hyper Gyaos swarm descended on Japan. The human army had managed to shoot down quite a few of the horrid abominations but Gamera was still doing most of the fighting. He had placed himself between the beasts and the train station Ayana and Asagi were in. A Gyaos dove and slammed into Gamera, almost toppling the heroic guardian over. Gamera launches a fireball point blank, decapitating the Gyaos. \"Asagi, do you think Gamera can really beat them all?\" asks Ayana, still a little shocked at what she had been through. \"Yes, if anything can do it, its Gamera.\" said Asagi. \"I feel so guilty, if I hadn't woke Iris up, Gamera would be at full power and the Gyaos wouldn't stand a chance.\" \"Look, you didn't know what Iris was or that he was even in that tomb. Ether way there's no telling what would of happened if Gamera hadn't fought him. We don't know what could have been. All that matters now is that Gamera needs all the help and support we can give him.\" Gamera almost cuts a Gyaos in half with his elbow blade before unleashing a barrage of fireballs on the flying beasts. Flaming Gyaos fall from the dark skies but it seemed for each one he killed, three more replace it. Gamera knew this was his fault. He shouldn't of drained the earths mana to destroy Legion, he should of found another way to kill the space monster. No, Gamera knew that there was no other way to stop Legion but that. He sends a fireball into his severed arm and forms another flaming fist. He rips through several more descending Gyaos. He looked over to see another of the winged beasts plummet from the skies from the earth's military. Gamera knew that he couldn't do this with their help but it hurt him to let them die, even without his human connection he still cared for humanity and felt regret for all the humans he had inadvertently killed during his battles. A Gyaos charges him from the side, he grabs the monster and tosses it into one of the few remaining buildings before crushing it beneath his foot. This wasn't working, he couldn't keep killing them one at a time. He fires on the buildings around him, causing them to burst into flames. The flames then surge into his mouth. A massive fireball, much like the one that killed the Super Gyaos fires. A massive explosion engulf the Gyaos filled sky, vaporizing many of the deadly beasts. As their flaming bodies slam into the ground, Gamera breathes heavily from fatigue. He couldn't keep this battle up. He quickly retracted his head into his shell to avoid a sonic ray. When his head reappears, the Gyaos swarm becomes quiet. They land on the remaining buildings. Gamera roars in defiance. Suddenly, another beast darkens the battlefield. It was a giant Gyaos, a full ten meters taller than Gamera. The other Gyaos' silence identified this beast as the leader of the swarm, the Alpha Gyaos. Gamera roars out as the massive monster sends out its sonic beam. Gamera blocks the beam with his shell. Gamera fires a fireball, Alpha Gyaos dodges and tackles Gamera. Gamera wraps his remaining hand around its throat and slams it to the ground. The two monsters bite and claw at each other. Alpha Gyaos fires its sonic beam into Gamera's arm. Forcing him to release his grip. Alpha Gyaos takes to the sky. Gamera sends fireball after fireball at the Alpha Gyaos. It dodges the rapid barrage. Alpha Gyaos sends out another beam, Gamera avoids the blast and sends out another blast of fire. Alpha Gyaos dives behind a building. Gamera looks behind him to find Asagi nodding to him before taking cover. Gamera retracts into his shell and begins to starts his jets. He takes to the sky and follows Alpha Gyaos. Alpha Gyaos and Gamera collide, Gamera using his spinning shell like a saw and Alpha Gyaos using its talons. Gamera stops spinning and extends his head and remaining arm. He charges and punches Alpha Gyaos, sending the evil creature flying backwards. Alpha Gyaos fires his sonic beam, Gamera counters with a fireball, the fireball detonates on impact with the beam. Gamera charges and bites down on Alpha Gyaos' wing, tearing a large chunk of flesh. Alpha Gyaos bites down on Gamera's shell, managing to tear a piece off. Gamera head butts Alpha Gyaos, sending the monster recoiling backwards as their fight goes over the sea. Gamera latches his jaws on Alpha Gyaos' leg and deactivates his jets. Alpha Gyaos flaps its wings rapidly to try and keep in the sky as Gamera drags it towards the ocean. Alpha Gyaos' wings fail it and Gamera brings it into the ocean. Alpha Gyaos bursts from the water, fighting hard to keep itself from being dragged under the ocean and into Gamera's habit. Gamera brings up his elbow blade and slashes into Alpha Gyaos' wing while Alpha Gyaos blasts him with its sonic beams. Gamera is fights through his pain and drags Alpha Gyaos under the sea. He drags it deeper and deeper into the ocean. He releases his grip before driving his teeth into Alpha Gyaos' throat. As Alpha Gyaos' blood seeps into the ocean, Gamera lets the dieing beast sink into the ocean. Gamera pulls himself from the sea and falls on the beach. The other Gyaos that had been watching the battle let out a vengeful scream at their leaders' murder. Gamera gets to his feet to meet the beasts. He fires up his leg rockets and flies toward the approaching killers. He blasts and slashes, covering the ruined city in Gyaos remains. Gamera knew there were far too many of them to kill like this. He only had one option left and it would be his last. He flew over to the train station. Asagi and Ayana peek out from the wreckage. Energy builds in Gamera's hand before he drove it deep into the ground. He looks at Asagi, with sadness in his eyes. Before Asagi can do anything, the Gyaos descend on Gamera, forcing him to the ground and piling on him. They are flung off as Gamera's spinning form bursts into the sky. Gamera flies upward, every last Gyaos pursues him, viciously wanting to end their ancient enemy. Gamera hovers in midair and begins spinning rapidly, faster than he every had before. Energy builds around him as he rapidly spins. By the time the Gyaos realize what's happening they are far too close. From the ground Asagi and Ayana watch. A massive explosion fills the sky. Blue energy radiates out from the blast. \"Is Gamera…\" asks Ayana, not wanting to finish her sentence. \"Yes, he gave his life for us.\" said Asagi, obviously saddened. \"What's that blue energy?\" \"He must be giving the earth it mana back, he's making sure the Gyaos have finally been destroyed for good this time.\" \"What did he do back there, when he drove his fist into the ground?\" \"I don't know.\" Well there you go with the first chapter, I was suprised how much fun I had writing this first chapter. I sort of got the ending from Gamera the Brave even if I never saw it, the replenishing the earth's mana was my idea. Well please R&R; and join me again next times[Chapter 2] Yes, I am finally updating this story! Sorry for the very long wait, I was waiting for the Gamera section to get bigger, which doesn't seem to be happening. Anyway now we learn whats happened to Ayana and the world in general. Also, you might be happy to know a certain Atlantian cult from Gamera 3 will be a central part of this fic. Enjoy. New Beginnings JSDF HQ, Tokyo, Midday; Ayana Hirasaka has changed her life. It is ten years after the battle in Kyoto in which Gamera self-destructed to obliterate the Gyaos swarm, in that last noble act, Gamera replenished the earth's mana and showed mankind what he was willing to do to save them. In response to the Gyaos swarm, mankind had learned its lesson. The Gyaos awakened because mankind had polluted their world and they knew should they keep polluting, the devil birds would return. This is why nearly all of mankind's pollution had been eliminated, it was hard work but the threat of fighting the Gyaos again without their protector was enough to scare the world into the right mind set. This didn't mean that the Gyaos were gone however. For the last 10 years, the anti-kaiju forces of the Japanese Special Defense Forces had been cleaning up the survivors of the final battle and Ayana was at its head. Knowing she had awakened Iris and thus helped weaken Gamera, Ayana decided she needed to help fill the void left by Gamera's noble death. \"Commander!\" yelled one of the men in the control room. \"Yes officer?\" asked Ayana. \"Gyaos sighting, one Hyper Level Gyaos and three infants, over the see off Hokkaido.\" \"Deploy the Guardian Squadron.\" In the docking bay set a squadron of specially designed jets. Each jet was equipped with armor that was replicated from Gamera bone recovered from the bottom of the sea, they made sure not to disturb the graves of countless Guardians out of respect for their own Gamera, they'd only took a small piece and that was enough. The synthetic bone armor wasn't as strong as Gamera's shell but was still enough to withstand the sonic beams of the Gyaos. They were also equipped with missiles that were designed to replicated Gamera's fireballs, predictably, these too weren't nearly as potent as those used by Gamera but they were good enough to be able to bring down Gyaos. Each jet was also equipped with a newly designed 'maser' cannons. Theses weren't as strong as the missiles but required no ammo and offered continuous fire. Derek Malcolm was the squad leader of this fight force. He was a well built, six foot tail American that had 30 Gyaos kills under his belt, without help of his squad mates. Naturally he was a logical choice for his job. \"Alright team, you heard the lady!\" he said. He hopped in his cockpit. \"Squadron Captain Malcolm, ready for launch.\" he said, receiving confirmation from his squad mates. \"Guardian Squadron, you are cleared for takeoff.\" said Ayana. \"Roger. Lets go kick some Gyaos tail!\" yelled Derek. He launched his jet out of the hanger, followed by his squad mates. He loved the rush of launching out of the hanger to shoot down a rogue Gyaos. It appeared that despite some Gyaos remaining, the restoration of the Earth's mana had the additional effect of lowering the reproduction rate of the Gyaos, making it so mankind could effectively shoot the beast down and keep their number's low. He check his radar and in a few minutes, one large blip and three smaller blips appeared. \"Alright team, prepare to engage.\" he said. He throttled the engine, like nearly all major energy sources, the jets ran on plasma power sources, something once more learned from Gamera. Soon the purplish flesh of the Hyper Gyaos and the deep red flesh of her offspring came into view. \"Take out the chicks first.\" Derek orders. The jets open fire on the young Gyaos with their masers, before the adult realized her offspring were in danger, one was flaming chunks of flesh raining down into the ocean. The adult roared in fury and got her young behind her. \"That got her mad.\" he said as the Hyper Gyaos fired her sonic ray. The jets barrel rolled out of the way and fired their missiles. The missiles flew behind the Gyaos and did a turn to hit the two remaining infants, blowing both young terrors to bits. The adult was furious. Gyaos flew forwards and fired her sonic ray. The jets dodged again, though Derek's wing was hit, the artificial bone armor withstood it, though it disrupted his flight path. He stabilized his jet, this was why they dodged despite the fact the jet's armor could survive the sonic beam, it could cause them to crash inadvertently. \"Alright squad, lets send this ugly monster back were she belongs!\" he yelled. He rolled as the Gyaos attempted to bite down on his jet and fired the maser right into the monster's eye, getting a satisfying screech of pain from the monster. The other jets fired their missiles at the beast, blowing holes in her wings. Gyaos fired her sonic beam but the agile planes dodged it. Derek looped around further in front of the monster as she opened her mouth to fire her sonic beam. All at once the squad fired their missiles into the mouth of the monster, severing the monster's head from her body and sending a flaming corpse crashing into the Pacific. \"Mission accomplished, Gyaos have been killed.\" said Derek to HQ. \"Good job commander, come back to base.\" said Ayana. \"Yes Miss Hirasaka.\" Unknown Location, 3 pm; Two figures hidden in darkness watched the battle that had occurred. \"It appears we can't count on the Gyaos to do their intended function, they're failing just like that Iris monster.\" said one, female. \"No matter, our project will soon be released to assist them.\" said the other, male. The two walked over to a glass window where a huge tank full of green liquid set, inside was a massive serpentine shape. \"Garasharp will be the instrument of the destruction of this decadent civilization.\" So Garasharp is being created as we speak and I'll give you three guesses who is creating him, note I'm not refering to a person, its a group. I don't know when I'll post again but I'll try to update more frequently. ","Summary":" Ok time for my first attempt at a Gamera fic. I'm truely surpised there aren't more Gamera fics, I'"},{"Movie":"Gamera","Title":"The Birth of Gamera","Author":"Anguirus111","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2287097","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Anguirus111 Note: This is a story about Gamera,rna gigantic flying turtle that was featured in a series of films by the Japanesernmovie company Daei.rnThe first six movies made in the sixties and seventies were lightrnhearted popcorn fair that ultimately flopped movie wise. However, in 1995 ShusukernKaneko directed a much more intense violent version of Gamerarnthat became an instant success. Thernmovie would then spawn a trilogy with two other movies accompanying it. In the first movie, it was revealed that therncity of Atlantis/Mu/whateverrnyou want to call it had created Gyaos(a massive bat that eats people and shoots hypersonic laserrnbeams from its mouth) but it destroyed their entire civilization before theyrnbarely managed to create Gamera. Gamera defeated thernGyaos and then went to sleep for the next thousandrnyears or so. This is my attempt tornexplain why the Gyaos were created and as a result Gamera. I'll try andrnresolve other issues like the amulet, but the Gamerarngraveyard is up in the air. I hope you'llrnenjoy this, but honestly this story will probably only appeal to Kaneko's Gamera fans. Atlantis,rnroughly 1200 BC: Nestled in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea just below Italy lay the island of Atlantis. It was like any other great nation of that time,rnGreek, Trojan, full of temples and other marble buildings. The roads were paved with bricks, carriagesrnand chariots were abundant everywhere.rnThe people were clothed in robes and other exotic garments either madernon the island or brought in by wooden boats.rnEverything on the outside seemed to be normal and on par with the times,rnbut below the surface, things were radically different. Science had taken off to a level unheard ofrnat that time. The scientists werernalready growing genetically engineered crops along with various fruits andrnvegetables to grow under extreme weather conditions and they'd also begunrnexperimenting with hybrid animals. Nornone knew exactly where the information to do all of this had come from, somernsuspected from the future, others from a long gone civilization in a far awayrnland. Either way, they were much fartherrnahead in scientific knowledge and abilities than any other comparablerncivilization, even more so than the future nations of the world. But all of this was kept secret and underrntight wraps as per the edicts of the high priestess Asagi. Although just sixteen, she was notrnnaive and decreed that none of this new science could ever be used for violencernor war. For the moment, the Atlantians stood by this decree, but a rising violentrnpolitical faction led by a popular but fearsome speaker named Nomanor Gyaos. He was young and energetic and he began tornmake the Atlantians fearful of an outside invasion byrnthe Greeks, Trojans, the Turks, or just anybody and that this new geneticrntechnology should be used to create weapons to protect Atlantis before outrightrndestroying their enemies. The followersrnof Asagi had managed to hold him off for a few yearsrnbut he was increasingly growing with power and with the Trojan War going on,rnmany feared that the victor would feel themselves invincible and turn theirrnattention towards Atlantis as their next victim. \"It's only a matter of time!\"rnshouted Nomanor at the large crowd gathered outsidernthe acropolis. \"This Trojan War is going to be over soon and when, not if, thernGreeks win, they're going to come back here in droves and do you think they'rerngoing to be satisfied with just defeating the Trojans? No, they're not. They're going to come after us. I know it and you all know it! We must use this new technology of ours torndevelop a weapon to both defend us and take out our enemies before they take usrnout!\" Shoutsrnof approval erupted from the crowd while others simply let loose with a chorusrnof boos. \"And where does it end?\" demanded Naoya, the elder of the town who had ruled Atlantis forrnmany years and always followed the advice of the priestess. \"Untilrnevery person on this planet is dead?rnThat is not the Atlantian way!\" More roars erupted from the crowd. \" We are the only ones who follow that code of ethics!\" shouted Nomanor. \"Our enemies don't follow it and are glad notrnto. Peace and prosperity can get yournkilled in today's war torn world and I don't want to see that happen to us.\" \"So we become them is that it?\"rnsaid Naoya disgusted. \"In order to defeat them wernmust become them? If that's your answerrnthan forget it, I'd rather die before that happens!\" The crowd really erupted over thisrnone. \"Better to become them than tornserve them! Atlantis will still live andrnwe will all still live, but those who would try and conquer us will not,\" said Nomanor. \"And what would you propose we do?\"rnasked Naoya changing his course. \"A bomb capable ofrnsplitting things apart piece by piece on a massive scale, what?\" \"No,\" said Nomanorrnshaking his head while Naoya breathed a sigh ofrnrelief. \"A bomb will never kill everyone, only a select few who are unluckyrnenough to be caught in its path. No, arnbio-weapon must be made from our new found genetic that will annihilate ourrnenemies through and through and will not rest until they are dead!\" The crowd exploded over thisrnstatement and several brawls broke out while Naoyarnjust shook his head in disgust. \"Silence!\" shouted a voice. The brawls immediately died down and everyonernturned to look up at a balcony overlooking the whole area. Priestess Asagirnstood looking at the procession with sadness. \"To assume that those abroad arerngoing to attack us is a mistake. Theyrnhave made no attempts so far and all of our relations with them have beenrnfriendly. If we engage in any form ofrnpreemptive strike, they will come after us and will loose science or nornscience. Our people will be destroyedrnand we will be nothing more than a myth or at best a forgotten memory. None of us want to see that happen and untilrnsuch a threat emerges, we will continue to live our lives as we always have, onrna basis of peace and harmony,\" said Asagi. \"Now gornabout your business. There is nothingrnmore this procession can bring about that will not engulf us in social chaos.\" With that she was gone and therncrowd slowly began turning away from the podiums. Naoya noddedrnapprovingly and left while Nomanor just stood therernsimmering in his own anger. As much asrnhe wanted to rebuke the priestesses actions, untilrnsomething came up to threaten the country, the people would always follow herrnadvice until it was too late. \"That woman is going to kill usrnall,\" said Nomanor walking off frustrated accompaniedrnby his trusty companion and slave J'onn. \"Regardless, there is no precedent for an attack and asrnlong as she is in power things will certainly stay that way,\" said J'onn. \"Then maybe it's time for things tornchange, before they could possibly get any worse,\" said Nomanor. \"You're implying treason,\" said J'onn. \"In order to defend this nation I willrnprotect it by any means necessary,\" said Nomanor.rn\"I've lived here too long to see it fall to foreign invaders.\" \"So what will you do?\" asked J'onn. \"I don't know what I will do, but I have an idea of what I might do. Ready my ship and get me all the knownrninformation on the current war being fought between the Greeks and thernTrojans,\" said Nomanor. J'onn nodded. \"Those who give up a littlernsecurity for a little freedom deserve neither security nor freedom,\" Nomanor quoted aloud, distorting the original phrase. \"Nowrnit's time that security was restored to Atlantis once and for all.\" With that he left, leaving J'onn with his thoughts. \"Whatever your plans may be, I justrnpray they don't endanger us all master,\" said J'onnrnalso heading off. Elsewhere: Naoyarnsat with the priestess in her chambers as the both reflected on the day'srnevents. \"Regardless of his fanaticism, herndoes have a point,\" admitted Naoya. \"We do not havernmuch of a military force here to protect us from our enemies. We've been lucky so far that the Greeks andrnthe Trojans are too concentrated on destroying themselves than to bother withrnus. But when the other falls, the victorrnmay very well set their sights on us.\" \"I don't believe we have anythingrnto fear,\" said Asagi. \"We have done nothing tornprovoke them and they nothing to provoke us. Our civilization is a model community andrneveryone can find something they enjoy here.\" \"Which may be exactly why theyrnwould,\" said one of handmaidens Irys. \"After all, thernmindset that the only way to prevent an attack is to create a nation that nornone would want to attack is false. Ifrnanything it makes people more willing to attack you.\" \"You sympathize with Nomanor?\" Asagi accused, sherncould tolerate Naoya's protests, but not someone inrnher inner circle. Irysrnshrugged. \"We all must honor what we believernin; otherwise how can we expect to live withrnourselves?\" asked Irys. \"Leave now,\" said Asagi waving her off. \"If that is what you believe in thenrnI have no place for you in my inner circle.\" \"Very well your highness,\" said Irys annoyed and left with a huff. \"A little harsh are we?\" asked Naoya. Asagi just shook her head. \"This is hardly the first timernwe've quarreled and I've grown tired of it,\" said Asagi.rn\"Every move I make she argues against it and I've had enough.\" \"You know, Nomanorrncould use her against you,\" said Naoya. \"It hardly matters,\" said Asagi brushing off the comment. \"In the meantime, we willrnsit by and wait for Nomanor to make his first move.\" \"It may be too late by then,\"rnwarned Naoya. \"It is our way, we can do little tornchange it,\" said Asagi and with that she bid himrnfarewell. Naoyarnbowed and left. Asagirnsighed and it seemed as if the entire weight of the world had just fallen onrnher shoulders. As she sat thererncontemplating what to do, a soft rumble was heard. Asagi laughed asrnshe got up and stooped behind her desk to pick up a moderately sized turtle. She brought it over to the center of the roomrnand began stroking its belly to the creature's delight as it gurgled happily. \"Oh what're we going to do Gamera?\" she asked the thing. \"Should we just pack up ourrnbags and leave or ride it out here and hope for the best?\" The turtle merely responded byrncurling up into its shell. \"Why am I not surprised?\" asked Asagi with a grin.rnShe set the turtle down on its shell and spun it causing it to spinrnaround again and again. Eventually itrnstopped and Gamera stuck out its head and looked atrnher unfazed. \"How you cannot be turned dizzy byrnthat I'll never know,\" said Asagi shaking her headrnand setting Gamera right side up. Gamera growledrnagain and stumbled off on its tiny feet towards a bowl of food waiting to berneaten. \"Hope you like it spicy you littlernglutton,\" Asagi called after the thing. Gamera buried itsrnhead in the spicy food and began eating and quickly devoured the whole thing tornAsagi's surprise.rnThen its little head shot up and it began trembling as in pain from allrnthe spices. However, before Asagi could comment on his predicament, Gamera'srneyes suddenly turned to rage and its toes clenched the floor so tightly that itrnactually made little dents in the stone floor.rnIt was almost as if Gamera had drawn strengthrnfrom the heat of the spices. \"Weird,\" said Asagirnbefore she reached into her shirt and pulled out a comma shaped amulet on arnchain that she wore around her neck. \"Hera, Zeus,rnApollo, whoever is out there listen to me plea, please protect my people fromrnany dangers that may arise in the near future, that is all that I ask.\" With that, she retired to herrnchambers and some rest leaving Gamera all alone. The creature slowly tottered over to the deskrnand quickly began trying to climb it.rnSoon it was nearly vertical with its hindlegsrnsupporting the whole creature. It thenrnpushed off the desk and slowly began tottering around on its back legs beforerntipping over. Gamerarnslowly shook the cobwebs loose and immediately returned to the desk to tryrnagain. It would learn to walk on twornlegs just like its master did or die trying. Nomanor'srnHouse: The politician sat reviewing the latest news from the Trojan War whilerndrinking some coffee before a knock was heard on his door. J'onn quickly movedrnto the door while Nomanor sighed and put down hisrnnotes. He nodded and J'onnrnopened the door to admit Irys who was soaked thanksrnto the storm currently brewing outside. \"Oh great what does our esteemedrnpriestess want now?\" asked Nomanor sarcastically. Irys shook herrnhead. \"Nothing, it seems I've finallyrnlost favor with her and am no longer in her court,\" said Irys. Nomanor laughed asrnhe propped his feet up on his desk. \"Why am Irnnot surprised?\" he said. \"So what do you want?\" \"Like you I agree that Asagi and Naoya are only delayingrnthe inevitable. We will be attacked andrnI'd rather see us be the victors and not some barbaric force,\" said Irys. \"I want to join you in whatever you have going on.\" \"How do I know you're not just somernspy sent by the priestess to make sure I'm not doing anything suspicious?\" thernpolitician asked. \"Even if I was, it's not like you'drnhave anything to fear. The worst they'drndo is expel you from the country and then you could sever all ties with thisrnplace once and for all and no longer give a damn what happens to it,\" said Irys simply. Nomanor shrugged. \"You do have a point,\" he conceded.rn\"Welcome to the team.\" \"Thank you,\" said Irys sitting down. \"So what do you have planned?\" \"Beware the leader who bangs therndrum of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor. Forrnpatriotism is indeed a double- edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, justrnas it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitchrnand the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have nornneed in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infusedrnwith fear and patriotism, will offer up all of their rights to the leader andrngladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Nomanor,\" said Nomanor. \"Huh?\" asked Irysrnconfused. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means I'm going on a diplomaticrntrip to Troy,\"rnsaid Nomanor leaving as he put on his cape. \"Takerncare of things while I'm gone J'onn, you too Irys. When I return,rnthings will be much different around here.\" \"Good fortune master,\" said J'onn. \"I hope that you are successfully in your mission.\" \"That being?\" asked Irys. Nomanor stopped just inside the doorway. \"To ensure the protection ofrnAtlantis and the rise of Gyaos,\" he said as thunderrncrashed overhead and with that he was gone.[Chapter 2] The nextrnday: Asagi was in her chambers with Gamera when Naoya burst in. \"Surelyrnyou've heard the news about Nomanor?\" he askedrnbreathing heavily after having apparently run to her shrine. \"Yes,\" saidrnAsagi not really caring as she helped Gamera totter around on his rear legs. \"He's going on arndiplomatic mission to the Trojan War in hopes of achieving peace between thoserntwo nations.\" \"It's arnvain mission though, you know that!\" shouted Naoya. \"Nomanor doesn't seem to think so,\" she said absently as sherncontinued 'walking' Gamera. \"He'srnlying!\" shouted Naoya. \"He's going there to organizernan attack on us and use it to jump to power!\" \"You don'trnknow that,\" said Asagi cutting in. \"To assume that hernis doing anything makes an ass of you and me.rnBesides, I don't believe it's in his character. He may be dedicated, but he's not a fanatic.\" \"You don'trnknow that!\" Naoya protested. \"He's leaving in a fewrnhours on his ship, we need to sneak in someone amongrnhis crew to report back to us on what he's doing.\" \"WE DO NOTrnSPY ON OTHERS!\" shouted Asagi angrily at Naoya as she let go of Gamera whornstumbled around for a little bit on its back legs before tumbling over onto itsrnback and flailing its stubby legs in the air as it desperately tried to rightrnitself. Unable to do say, it resorted torngrowling helplessly. \"See,\" shernsaid. \"Now look and what you've made me do.rnSorry Gamera.\" She placedrnthe turtle on its feet and it ambled off across the floor. Asagi pushed arnloose strand of hair behind her head and tried to regain her composure. \"We do notrnspy on others, it is not our way and I do not intend to start now,\" she said. \"But-,\"rnbegan Naoya. \"No,\" said Asagi. \"My decision is final. Besides, if you were to put a spy on his boatrnand Nomanor found out, he could use that against usrnand we would both loose face and give him control over the whole of Atlantis.\" \"Fine, butrnthis is all going to blow up in our face, one way or another,\" said Naoya leaving in a huff. \"Yes,\" Asagi agreed quietly after he had left. \"Yes it will.\" With thatrnshe picked up Gamera and exited her room. \"Priestess,\"rnsaid another handmaiden worriedly as soon as she exited. \"Where are you going?\" \"I need tornsee the head scientists,\" she said sadly. \"Gods help us all.\" Docks: Nomanor Gyaos's ship The Swarm of Legion , sat next to therndocks as workers began filling it with supplies for the journey ahead. Nomanor stoodrnadvising everyone of their duties until he wasrnapproached by Naoya. \"Oh look,rneveryone's favorite governor,\" said Nomanor. \"Come tornsee me off?\" \"Yes Irnsuppose I am,\" said Naoya. \"And I know what you'rernreally up to. You won't get away with it, otherwise it'll be the downfall of our entirerncivilization.\" \"Well Irndon't know what you think that I'mrndoing,\" began Nomanor. \"But rest assured thatrnwhatever it is, I am definitely doing it.\" Nomanor grinned and walked off. \"This isn'trnover!\" shouted Naoya.rnNomanor quickly spun around. \"On therncontrary, it's only just begun,\" he said finally before leaving. Naoya growledrnbefore walking back behind a group of crates.rnStanding back there was, Kam, a worker on Nomanor's ship and was currently being employed as Naoya as a spy, despite Asagi'srnwarnings. \"Do yournknow what you have to do?\" asked Naoya one finalrntime. \"Yes,\" saidrnKam. \"Now pay up.\" Naoya sighed and retrieved a small pouch filled with gold. \"Nowrnremember, you cannot be caught or found out otherwise it'll mean the end of allrnof us,\" warned Naoya. \"Whatever,rnI'm going,\" said Kam not caring. With that he was gone leaving Naoya and his worries behind. Sighing he looked at his hands, which wererntrembling and willed them to stop. Withrnthat he left as a figure emerged from the shadows. \"Well,rnwell, well,\" said Irys evilly. \"So he does have arnbackbone after all.\" With thatrnshe left to find Nomanor. ClassifiedrnLocation: Asagi stroked Gamera'srnhead as she carried him through a series of underground tunnels while being ledrnby an Atlantian scientist. Asagi sighed, arnmore seemingly common trait among her, since the discovery of this new sciencernin the field of genetics. Finally afterrnseveral minutes of walking, she emerged in a large cavern filled with dozens ofrncylindrical tubes, each possessing a genetically modified creature inside. Four years ago, when she was just a mererntwelve years old, she had ordered the construction of this hidden laboratoryrnand the creation of creatures that might one day have to protect Atlantis andrnits assets. Then she didn't know if itrnwas the right idea and had constantly debated over whether or not it was a goodrnidea, even to today she still debated it out to no avail. \"We'rerndelighted you've finally decided to take an interest in our work priestess,\"rnsaid the lead scientist. \"You'vernbeen on your own for four years, you'd better have created something good inrnthat time,\" said Asagi sharply. The scientist nodded. \"We have,\"rnhe said nodding sharply. \"The newfound genetics technology has allowed us torncreate some wonderful specimens that all can in one way or another protect Atlantis and wreak havoc on our enemies.\" \"Good, showrnme,\" said Asagi leading on. \"Alrightrnload it up and we'll be going,\" said Nomanor to arnworker who nodded and left as a cannon was hoisted overhead. As he was looking over the operations, Irys sauntered up to him. \"Guess whatrnI just saw?\" she asked sneakily. Nomanor looked at her nonplussed. \"No,\" hernsaid finally. \"If it's that important keep it to yourself, but if it isn't thenrnjust tell me.\" \"Fine,\"rnsaid Irys harrumphing. \"You're no fun.\" \"This is nornlaughing matter,\" said Nomanor sternly. \"I'm tryingrnto save our entire civilization here in case you hadn't noticed.\" Irys rolled her eyes. \"Alright, alright. I just found out that Naoyarnhas a spy among your crew, his name's Kam and he'llrnreport everything you do to him when you get back.\" \"It figuresrnhe'd pull something like that,\" said Nomanorrnshrugging. \"Yeah, butrnwho'd have thought the priestess would reduce herself to that level, it goesrnagainst her personal code of ethics,\" said Irys. \"That's whyrnshe didn't authorize it,\" said Nomanor signing off onrnsomething. \"He's obviously going behind her back to do it.\" \"So yourndon't have to leave, this is your chance to seize control and prove that Naoya is unstable,\" said Irysrnhappily. Nomanorrnshook his head. \"I onlyrnhave your word to go on, that's not good enough,\" said Nomanor.rn\"And besides, when I finally gain control, I want the people behind me. Until then I have no problem with Naoya ruling Atlantis.\" \"But,\" protested Irys. \"I'm notrnevil Irys, don't think that I am. Everything I'm doing is for Atlantis, not forrnme,\" he said leaving. Irys just looked after him darkly. \"You mayrnnot be in for this for yourself, but I am,\" she said with an evil grin beforernleaving herself. As she did, The Swarm of Legion, moved away from the docks andrnheaded out for Troy. \"This is Zigra,\" Thernscientist was showing Asagi a strange looking sharkrnfilled with nothing but sleek and sharp edges.rnIt was currently barely taller than she was, and was motionless insidernof its cage, but it radiated power and ferocity. \"It's notrnvery big,\" said Asagi still somewhat unimpressed. \"All of ourrncreatures have a special enzyme encoded in their pituitary glands to allow forrninstant and substantial growth. Thisrnthing could grow to be several feet long if not taller,\" said the scientist. \"And justrnwho would control this growth?\" asked Asagirnconcerned. \"Well wernwould,\" said the scientist. \"But if need be, they could grow on their own Irnguess.\" \"Yourn'guess'?\" asked Asagi. The scientist shrugged. \"We don'trnknow, we haven't really enlarged any ourselves so we don't know what they'rerncapable of,\" said the scientist. \"Although this thing can shoot a laser fromrnits mouth and fly.\" \"What'srnnext?\" asked Asagi waving her hand beginning to regretrnall this. \"Next wernhave Barugon,\" said the scientist dramatically. He threw down a cloth around another tube,rnthis one containing a strange blue and purple bipedal beast with a horn on itsrnhead. \"Wow,\" saidrnAsagi nonplussed. \"It getsrnbetter,\" said the scientist. \"This thing can shoot freezing rays from its mouthrnand has an impressive long range weapon that looks like a rainbow. It really packs a punch.\" He producedrnsome pictures showing the creature on a battlefield full of cardboard cutoutsrnand its freezing breath and rainbow ray destroying things left and right. Then a final shot showingrnthe ravaged room. \"Itrnhas…potential,\" said Asagi finally putting the photosrnaside. \"What's next?\" Thernscientist moved to another tube and yanked it down revealing a manta ray. Asagi was about tornmake some witty remark about unoriginality before the scientist spoke up. \"This is Mantia,\" said the scientist. \"It too can fly and it shootsrna very powerful multi-colored ray from its mouth while shooting electricity fromrnits tail. It's ferocious as hell. It truly is 'the scourge of the skies.'\" \"What'srnnext?\" Asagi said laughing. \"Arngiant squid?\" \"Ummm….\" began the scientist. Asagi's jawrndropped. \"It is arngiant squid?\" she asked incredulously.rnThe scientist didn't say anything but just pulled down another curtainrnrevealing a squid with a massive knife shaped head. \"It used tornshoot TK blasts and take over peoples minds before we removed that portion ofrnits brain. Now it's pretty much just arnvegetable,\" said the scientist sadly. \"You point it and it attacks but that'srnabout it for this thing.\" \"Oh well,\"rnsaid Asagi looking at the blank stare of therncreature. \"Next is Jiger,\" said the scientist revealing a new creature thatrndidn't look altogether that much different than Baragon. \"Superrnstrength is about all this thing has,\" said the scientist moving on. \"Gods myrnheadache feels like a knife cutting through my head,\" said Asagirnholding her head. \"Whichrnbrings us to our next creature,\" said the scientist throwing back another clothrnrevealing a bipedal creature with a large knife and two throwing stars embeddedrnon each side for a head. \"Behold Guiron, he's a real cut up,\" said the scientist with arncheap grin. \"Ha, ha, sorry old joke around here.\" \"You needrnto get out more,\" said Asagi shaking her head. \"Isrnthat it?\" \"Yeah,\"rnsaid the scientist suddenly nervous. \"Yeah that's it.\" Suddenly anrnear wrenching scream was heard and a nearby heavy metal door began shakingrnbefore shots rang out and then silence. \"What wasrnthat?\" demanded Asagi. \"Ourrngreatest success, our greatest failure,\" said the scientist sadly. Asagi ran over tornthe door and looked through a peephole as a decent sized bat-like creature wasrnhaving its mouth wrapped shut by scientists and placed back in its cage. \"That wasrnour first experiment and it was more powerful than we could have anticipatedrnand is not docile in anyway. It cannotrnbe controlled no matter how hard we've tried,\" said the scientist. \"Thenrnwhat's to stop it from taking over the world?\" Asagirnasked. \"The onlyrnadvantage we have is that it's very sensitive to light and will do anything tornavoid it. Until it evolves to protectrnitself from the light, it'll remain that way and that is our only advantage,\"rnsaid the scientist worriedly. \"So there you have it, Atlantis's new protectors,rnwhat do you think?\" \"They'rernall…nice,\" said Asagi. \"But none of them are thatrnappealing aesthetically. It looks likernyou ate dinner one day and decided to turn your meal into living weapons. I want something that is both powerful and inrnits own way cuddly. Somethingrnthat will defend us, but would never turn against us.\" \"And thatrnwould be?\" asked the scientist confused. \"How longrnwould it take you to create a new bio-weapon?\" Asagirnasked. \"A few months,rnhalf a year I'd say,\" said the scientist. \"Why?\" \"I have arnnew goal I want you to accomplish, one that will both protect us but never turnrnagainst us,\" said Asagi as she stroked Gamera's head. \"And?\"rnasked the scientist. \"This isrnour Guardian of the Universe,\" said Asagi. \"And itrnwill never turn against us because it will forever be linked with humanityrnthrough this.\" Asagi took off her amulet and handed it to the scientist. \"Can it berndone?\" she asked handing over one other thing. \"Are yournsure about all this?\" asked the scientist. \"I am,\"rnsaid Asagi. \"No one is to know about this, becausernthe final night is about to fall on Atlantis and we need a flicker of light tornbring us from the darkness.\" \"Yesrnpriestess, it will be done,\" said the scientist leaving with the twornitems. Asagirnnodded with tears in her eyes and left the cavern and its secrets behind. Weeksrnlater: The Swarm of Legion came to arnhalt amidst the joyous celebrations of the Greeks over the defeat of thernTrojans thanks to their wooden horse. \"Woodenrnhorses will one day be no match for real bioweapons,\"rnsaid Nomanor with disdain at the excessive partying. \"Yes,\"rnagreed J'onn. \"One day.\" Theyrnapproached a massive tent that was full of guards who were too wasted to put uprnany resistance against them entering. Nomanor entered with his entourage and saw a desk uponrnwhich sitting behind it was a very happy Menelaus. \"Nomanor? Is it you?\" Menelaus asked rubbing his eyes.rn\"I must be drunk!\" \"No it'srnme,\" said Nomanor. \"Congratulations on your victoryrnover the Trojans.\" \"Thank you,rnthank you,\" said Menelaus. \"You are too kind.\" \"Yes,\" saidrnNomanor. \"So what are your plans now? Surely the Greek war machine will not bernstopped so easily…\" \"Yeah,\"rnlaughed Menelaus. \"Maybe we'll come after you and Atlantis!\" Nomanor shrugged lightly. \"Maybe, but you'll never win.\" \"What?\"rndemanded Menelaus still drunk. \"We have defeated Troy, we can defeatrnanyone!\" \"You foughtrnwith Troy forrncountless years,\" said Nomanor. \"You've lost yourrnbest warriors, Achilles is gone, who will spur yourntroops to action? Odysseus? Somehow I see him wanting to return home tornhis family, provided he doesn't get lost on the way back. No, there's no chance, especially with ourrnimproved defenses.\" \"Nothingrncan stand against the Greek Army!\" shouted Menelaus his speech becoming morernand more slurred. \"Yeah,\"rnsaid Nomanor leaving. \"You just keep telling yourselfrnthat.\" \"We willrndestroy you!\" shouted Menelaus before slamming down on the table out cold. \"Wellrnthat's about all I needed to accomplish here,\" said Nomanorrnleaving. \"That'srnit?\" J'onn asked. \"I thought you would've reallyrnprovoked him or something.\" \"It's anrnaptitude test,\" said Nomanor. \"If he really has anyrndesire to attack Atlantis he will, if not then we really do have nothing tornworry about and I'll stop making trouble for Naoya.\" \"Seems likerna waste of a trip,\" said Kam who was also with them.rn\"That's really all?\" \"Yes,\" saidrnNomanor, cautious around what he said around him.rn\"Besides, I wasn't too big a fan of Troyrnanyways, seeing it fallen like this feels good in a way.\" In the farrndistance they saw smoke still rising from the destroyed city. \"Enough ofrnthis, we'll swing by Italy real quick, pick up a few things and head back tornAtlantis,\" said Nomanor leaving the scene of intensernpartying behind. \" One day, the weapons of Atlantis willrndescend upon our enemies and there will be nothing that can stop them ,\"rnthought Nomanor with disdain at the situation aroundrnthem as he entered into his boat and it set off for Italy, Atlantis, and the future.[Chapter 3] Over the next few months, thernscientists of Atlantis worked on Asagi's new projectrnwhile The Swarm of Legion was out atrnsea. Despite her best intentions, Asagi couldn't help but wish that the boat would berndestroyed at sea by Poseidon's mercy.rnSadly, her wish did not come true as three weeks later The Swarm of Legion returned to portrnfull of goods from abroad. \"Nomanor,rnit is good to see you are back safely,\" said Asagi asrnsoon he disembarked from his ship. \"Sure you are,\" said Nomanor as Vash was hauled downrnthe steps in shackles. \"What is this?\" asked Asagi confused. \"We discovered that he was a spy,\"rnsaid Nomanor. \"We don't know who exactly he wasrnworking for, but we'll find out. \"I too look forward to the answer,\"rnsaid Asagi. \"I'm sure you'll find the answersrnenlightening,\" said Nomanor as he brushed past her. \"So what did you learn from thernvictorious Greek Army?\" asked Asagi. \"Nothing,\" said Nomanorrnwith a grin. \"Absolutely nothing.\" \"Good,\" said Asagi.rn\"In the meantime, you have to focus on your reelection campaign. It'll be election day before you realize it.\" \"I've decided that I'm not going tornrun for reelection,\" said Nomanor. \"I'm retiring.\" Asagirnlooked at him bewildered. \"But you're just entering into your prime.\" \"And I'm tired,\" said Nomanor. \"I'm tired of preaching about a war that willrnprobably never be and tired of constantly butting heads with you overrneverything. If the people want you tornrun them to ruin then so be it.\" \"You truly believe that?\" Asagi asked. \"I don't know what to believernanymore,\" said Nomanor truthfully and with that hernleft. Asagirnsighed and went in the opposite direction.rnShe missed Gamera's company right now, but shernknew that if she hadn't let him go, there was a distinct possibility thatrnthey'd all pay if she hadn't made that decision. The weeks passed, Nomanor did indeed quite politics and retired to a cabinrnfar away in the countryside. Irys tried unsuccessfully to trick the citizenry intornbelieving that Asagi was an unfit priestess and thatrnshe should rule. She was banished to therncountryside and reportedly had found refuge in Nomanor'srnhome. For Asagi,rnthings couldn't have been better, she was in power and there was no threat tornit from anywhere. Although she oftenrnthought about discontinuing the bioweapon developmentrnproject, she still harbored a small doubt that Greece might still attackrnthem. This prediction would come true,rnthree years after the fall of Troy. Atlantis: The day started brightrnand early. Everyone woke up and went torndoing their daily routine. Whether workingrnin the port, or in the city, or even the countryside, it did not matter, it wasrna beautiful day out and the sun was shining brightly in the cloudless sky. Vuar Dibb was just a regular man who worked at the lookout inrnthe Atlantianrn Bay to spot incomingrnthreats from the sea. They never came,rnso Vuar would often bring the local paper andrnwhatever books he had with him to read on his shift. As a result, when he went up to hisrnwatchtower overlooking the bay, he did not look out onto the ocean at all. If he had, he may have noticed an armada ofrnthirty Greek ships approaching silently in the distance. Vuar might alsornhave noticed balls of fire erupting from the ships coming straight for therncoastal area. But he didn't, so he wasrntaken completely by surprise when the balls of flame began blasting the coastrnto pieces and that one of them would smash into his tower, blowing it tornpieces, and killing him in the process. Atlantis City:rnSmoke was seen rising in the distance just over the hilltops as the citizenryrnheard the explosions in the distance. \"What is going on?\" someonernshouted. \"I heard the coast is under attack,rnby the Greeks!\" \"Calm down!\" shouted Naoya. \"Don't start spreading rumors until we know therntruth.\" As the panic in the town grewrnlouder and louder, a cadre of horses entered into the town center, composes ofrnseveral Greek soldiers and one commander.rnThe commander went to the center of the town plaza. \"By order of the Greek Government,\"rnsaid the commander reading a scroll. \"The people of Atlantis are ordered tornsurrender immediately to the Greek Army.rnYou have one full day to come to terms with this and inform us, if notrnwe plunder and destroy your island. It'srnyour choice but we do not care either way.\" With that the commander tossed thernscroll to the ground and rode off with his troops. \"We need to hold an emergencyrnmeeting of the senate now,\" said Naoya walking offrnhurriedly towards the senate building. Senate Building:rnThe senate was in a deep state of anxiety and unrest over this sudden andrnabrupt change in events. \"What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?\" screamed a fat politician whornhad clearly never done any hard work in his life. \"I'll tell you what we do wernsurrender now and hope for the best,\" said another. \"The Greeks are probablyrnjust messing with us. When we surrender,rnthey'll laugh at our weakness and then leave.\" \"No,\" said another grimly. \"Theyrnwouldn't have sent that many ships just for a prank. They're serious so the question is what're werngoing to do about it?\" \"We will come up with something,\"rnsaid Naoya. \"We are Atlantiansrnand we are known for our innovation.\" \"Fine!\" shouted someone. \"You wantrninnovation, how about this. Nomanor knew this day would come, when the Greeks wouldrncome for us, and it stands to reason that he would have a way out of this!\" Cheers as agreement erupted fromrnthe throng. \"If he had any plans,\" argued Naoya vainly. \"And he does, they would be three years outrnof date at best!\" \"A plan is a plan!\" shouted anotherrnsenator. \"And it's more than you ever had!\" Chants of Nomanorrnrang out and grew louder and louder as Naoya justrnstood there in shock and stupor at how quickly things had changed. Later, Nomanor'srncottage: Nomanor was reading the local news at hisrnkitchen table while Irys sat there bored out of herrnmind while J'onn cleaned the dishes. \"When are they gonnarnget here?\" Irys yelled out suddenly. Nomanor looked atrnher briefly before returning to his reading. \"They'll be here, don't worry,\" hernsaid as he turned the page. \"After all, fear attracts the fearful.\" \"The strong, the weak, therninnocent, and the corrupt I know,\" said Irys. \"Butrnyou'd think they'd be knocking down your door right now.\" \"I'm kind of hoping they don't,\"rnsaid Nomanor. \"They didn't believe me when I said Greecernwas a threat and now they're coming to me when they are. I have half a mind to refuse them.\" \"What?\" demanded Irys.rn\"After everything you said…\" \"My loyalty is to Atlantis,\" Nomanor snarled. \"Not to the idiots in charge. I will ensure that she if forever safe by anyrnmeans necessary.\" With that Nomanorrnreturned to his reading as a knock emanated from the door. \"Finally,\" said Irysrnecstatically as J'onn went to answer it. \"You have issues,\" said Nomanor to her as J'onn openedrnthe door to reveal a mob outside. \"Sir,\" said J'onn.rn\"We have visitors.\" Nomanorrngrabbed his coat as Irys followed him to the door. \"So you've come to kill me is thatrnit?\" asked Nomanor.rnThe crowd briefly laughed. \"We need your help,\" shouted arnsenator. \"The Greeks have invaded just like you said! You know of a way to get us out of this.\" \"And why should I help you? I warned you this day would come but yournignored me!\" shouted Nomanor. \"And now you come to mernfor help when it does happen? How isrnthat fair to me?\" \"What're you saying? That you won't help us?\" someone asked. Nomanor shook hisrnhead. \"No I will help you defeat thisrnmenace,\" he said. \"But under one condition, I'm also going to make sure thisrndoesn't happen again. I'm not going tornrule you, but if you do not give me unlimited command of our military then yourncan forget it.\" \"We give it to you!\" shouted thernmob. \"Then return to the city, I will bernalong shortly,\" said Nomanor. The mob nodded gratefully and left the house. \"Fools,\" said Nomanorrnshaking his head. \"What are you so upset about?\"rnasked Irys confused. \"They got you where you wantedrnto be right?\" \"You'll never understand,\" said Nomanor sadly. \"But I do. Beware the leader who bangs therndrum of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor. Forrnpatriotism is indeed a double- edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, justrnas it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitchrnand the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have nornneed in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infusedrnwith fear and patriotism, will offer up all of their rights to the leader andrngladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Julius Caesar.\" \"Sounds reasonable to me,\" began Irys. \"No, it's not!\" shouted Nomanor. \"I'm going to bring down AtlantianrnCivilization just like Caesar did to the Romans. The only difference is I know I'm going to dornit, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it because like them I too amrnafflicted with patriotism.\" \"So what're you going to do?\" Irys asked. Nomanor looked up at her. \"My job,\" he said. \"Let's go.\" The three of them left and headedrnfor the city.

Queen Tabitha fanned herself with a dried rose petal and madenimpatient clicking noises with her tongue, causing her husband tonlean toward her and whisper, \"I do hate that noise you make,ndear.

Look,\" he went on hastilynas Thumbelina tried to interrupt, \"it's been in the family forngenerations, it's a tradition, you know – Would you prefer a newnone?\" At this his tone changed slightly as he began to feel anbit insulted. \"I could go dig one up for you.\" \" No , Cornelius.\" Thumbelina tried to keep hernvoice even. \"I – \" She covered her face with her handsnmomentarily. \"It's just...it's just that I think it'sntoo...too...\" \"Well?\" prompted Cornelius impatiently. Thumbelina looked up abruptly. \"It's huge! \" Whennthe Prince went back to looking mystified, she rushed on, \"Injust think it's too big...and flashy...for me. You see?\" Hendidn't see. She exhaled. \"Cor,\" she said gently, usingnthe nickname even the Prince's own parents wouldn't utter despite hisnyears of insistence, \"it's just not me .\" But Cornelius wasn't placated. \"What's not 'you'?\" hendemanded, a flush creeping into his face. \"Upholding my family'sntraditions? Being a Fairy Princess?\" he demanded as Thumbelinanflushed as well. \"Lina,\" he pressed, using her ownnnickname, \"you are royalty now. The people expect younto...dress the part.\" Thumbelina drew herself up indignantly, suddenly ashamed of thennew lavender silk gown she was wearing especially for the Invocation.n\"I am not some tailor's dressform to be dolled up!\" shenshot back, her blue eyes flashing. \"I am not accustomed tonparading about dripping with jewels and looking down my nose atneveryone I meet!\" \"But that's what you're supposed to do!\" thenPrince cried in frustration, hands in the air. Several paces away from the squabbling Fairies, a burly bumblebeendroned uneasily. Buzzby never liked to hear his master raise hisnvoice; it put his dander up, and hearing Thumbelina speak harshlynwasn't helping any. He shuttled about nervously on the sandy ground,nlooking yearningly over his shoulder at the Palace, wishing hisnmaster and his master's mate would stop shouting at each other andnget on his back so they could go to the nice, cool Courtroom wherenevery Fairy in the Vale had gathered. Buzzby knew they would all benthere from experience: whenever every one of the purple banners wasnraised like that it meant for everyone to meet inside. It didn'tnmatter what the Prince and Princess were doing, the point was thatnthey were supposed to be in there and yet they were not and that wasnmaking Buzzby very uneasy. Just as Buzzby scuttled forward to give Cornelius an urgent prodnwith his antennae Thumbelina threw back her arm and hurled thendiamond at the Prince's chest. Cornelius stumbled backward in alarm,ntherefore tripping over Buzzby and landing quite ungraciously in anheap on the other side of the bumblebee, clutching the diamond innsurprise. Thumbelina stood over him, hands on hips. \"Don't tell menwhat I'm supposed to do!\" she blurted angrily, although shenfought back tears. \"And don't tell me who I'm supposed to be!\"nAnd with that she stormed off into the flowers towards the Palace. Cornelius was so appalled he lay there on his back blinkingnstupidly at the sky for a few moments before rolling to his feet.n\"Thumbelina!\" he called, jogging after her. He reached thenPrincess, who had frozen in her tracks, staring at the Palace.n\"Thumbeli – \" he started to say her name again, but thennhe saw it, too. A swarm of creatures was attacking the Palace, crashing throughnthe windows to enter. Thumbelina couldn't tell what they were –nthey darted through the air like grey blurs. \"Oh Cornelius, what are they?\" she gasped in horror. \"I don't know – but I'll find out. Buzzby, let's go!\"nCor cried, stuffing the diamond necklace inside his tunic and leapingnon the bumble's back. This call to action suited the bee very wellnand he took off immediately towards the Palace. Thumbelina fluttered after them. \"Wait!\" she shouted,nfrightened. \"Cornelius!\" But her husband did not hear. Buzzby sped towards the Palace justnas the creatures began streaming back out, each of them holding onenor two struggling Fairies. The Prince saw now that they were Kobolds,na member of the Dark Fey (Cor, like all Fairies, had learned tonrecognize all of the Faerie-Kin by use of paintings; the Fairies innthe Vale had no real contact with any other Fey, whether they benLight, Dark, or Neutral). The Kobolds were big, more than twice thensize of Fairies, and were entirely grey from their long, pointednfaces to their long, pointed feet. Even their clothes were the samencolor, giving them the appearance of being carved out of solid rock.nThey were evidently more than a match even for the Royal Guard, whonwere among the first to be carried away and out of sight. The attacknhad been a total surprise. A big Kobold whizzed by, and Cornelius spun around in horror as henspotted his own mother dangling from its stony claws. \"Cornelius! Cornelius!\" she cried, frightened, reachingnout to him. And then they vanished in the swarm, which was nownretreating as swiftly as it had arrived. The sight goaded Cor to fury, and he drew his sword as he spurrednBuzzby on after the pair. But it was no good – the swarm was fastnapproaching the horizon, and the bumblebee could not hope to overtakenthem. Nonetheless, Cornelius continued to give chase. Suddenly a Kobold – evidently a straggler - dropped upon thenPrince and his mount from above and with a well-placed kick sentnBuzzby crashing to earth. Cor remained in the air and whirled innspace, his wings trailing gold, as he slashed out at his attacker.nBut the Kobold was alarmingly swift and, dodging, seized Cor by thenswordarm and in a second had him pinned and was zooming along afternthe others with his prisoner. Cor had one frantic thought. \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina!\"nhe screamed, looking wildly about as the ground moved under him in anblur; the Kobold was holding him at an awkward angle. But if hisnPrincess was in the clutches of one of the silent Dark Fey it wouldnbe unlikely he could spot her. Until... \"Cornelius!\" Cor bent in half to see Buzzby, with Thumbelina on his back,ndogging his captor's flight. \"Thumbelina, no!\" Why couldn't she just hide somewherenuntil the danger had passed? \"Faster, boy,\" Thumbelina hissed to her mount, who wasnalready at top speed. It wouldn't be fast enough. The Kobolds movednlike the wind. But Buzzby hummed angrily and flew on. Cor's Kobold looked round at Thumbelina; his face contorted innanger before he looked again after his retreating fellows. He was atnthe rear of the swarm, and no one else was likely to spot Thumbelina.nHis hands were full with the kicking Prince, and, resignedly, he spednaway after the others, leaving Thumbelina and Buzzby far behind innminutes. Cornelius watched Thumbelina disappear at last behind them with annodd sense of relief. At least she had been spared. He held still fornseveral minutes, clinging to his sword and gathering his strength. Henhoped to escape. At last he felt he was ready. He readjusted his grip on his weaponnand waited for the Kobold to dip slightly in his flight, making itneasier for the Prince to throw his weight upward and jab at the Fey'snwing. He missed the wing but landed a glancing blow to the Kobold'snshoulder, leaving a long, bleeding gash. The Kobold was sufficientlyntaken by surprise and released Cor's non-swordarm; Cor seized hisnkidnapper firmly by the front of his tunic and kicked him hard in thenlegs. The Kobold took a swing at the Prince, trying to get a new holdnon him. Cor twisted to the side; the failed followthrough of thenswing threw the Kobold significantly off balance and he was forced tonrelease the Fairy to keep himself plunging out of the air entirely. Cornelius dropped several feet then hovered, facing his assailant.nHe was ready to fight the huge Fey, to the death, if need be. Therenwas no time to lose; he knew he must find a way to overtake thenKobolds and save his people. But the Kobold who had carried Cornelius off hesitated. He wasnalready much too far behind the swarm...He looked anxiously betweennthe swarm and Cornelius and, making up his mind, sped off into thensky. Cornelius hovered there, panting slightly, and lowered his sword.nHe had been spared, then. But his people were long gone andnThumbelina and Buzzby many miles behind him. He was on his own.nSheathing his sword, he started flying in the direction the Koboldsnhad taken, keeping low to the ground. Clearly he would need help. A bird, maybe, something that couldnfly fast, for long distances...He thought of Jacquimo, Thumbelina'snswallow friend. A possibility. But how would he ever find him? Hendidn't even know where he was now: a field of tall grass borderingna forest. And his path was taking him directly into that forest. As Cor was trying to decide what to do about the forest – flynthrough, over, or around it – he heard a crashing in the grassnbehind him. He'd barely turned around when the something camenhurtling through the air and knocked him back about a foot beforenpinning him to the ground. Cor blinked as he fought to catch hisnbreath, which had been knocked clean out of him, and managed tonfocus. It was that toad . Cor lay on his back, stunned. That toad! The big toad whose familynhad kidnapped Thumbelina and who had then proceeded to try and killnCornelius personally; the same toad that Cor had driven over the sidenof an underground bridge – himself flying to safety in time - andnwhom he never expected to see again. And now that selfsame toad wasnsitting on top of him, his eyes boggling with fear. It was thatnexpression that stirred Cor to action. \"So!\" exclaimed Cornelius, shoving the toad off of him –nas well as he could, as the toad was built like a cobblestone. \"Inwouldn't have expected it, but it seems I have some unfinishednbusiness with you!\" He knew he had no time for this, butnsomehow, having to face down one toad was a much more refreshingnprospect than taking on an entire swarm of Kobolds. The toad, for his part, didn't seem all that interested in whatnCor had to say. He kept making as if to dart around the Fairy, who,nirritated, had to sidestep in front of him repeatedly to keep himnfrom nipping past. Finally, Cornelius shouted, \"Hey! Look at menwhile I'm threatening you!\" Suddenly the toad gave up trying to go around the Prince andnhopped over his head. Affronted, Cor seized the toad by one ankle,ntripping him and sending him sprawling onto his stomach. \"Cowardly,neh?\" Cornelius sneered. And the toad did indeed seem terrified. He flipped himself overnwith a grunt and kicked Cornelius away from him sharply. Then henscrambled to his feet and once again began hopping off frantically innthe same direction. \"Hey!\" Cornelius buzzed his wings in indignation. \"I'mntalking to you!\" He flew after the fleeing toad, catching upnwith some difficulty – the portly amphibian was faster than henlooked. He zipped around to face the toad, flying backwards to do so.n\"Stand your ground and – \" It was then that Cornelius saw that the toad hadn't been runningnfrom him . Half-running, half-flying, and tearing up the groundnat an alarming pace, was a massive white stork, its long red billnopen in anticipation of a tasty amphibian snack. Suddenly it lungednand the toad leaped and Cornelius found himself plastered to thenbird's head, right between the eyes. He couldn't suppress a yelp ofnfright. The stork squawked angrily and shook its head in an attempt to ridnitself of the thing clinging to its face, but it didn't slow in itsnpursuit of the toad. Finally with one mighty whip of its neck itnmanaged to send Cornelius sailing off into the grass – but notnwithout a price. The bird screamed in pain, but continued to chasenthe toad. Cornelius rolled to his feet and dropped the great bunch of whitenfeathers he had ripped from the crown of the stork's head. He wasnlucky to be uninjured, and he turned to put some distance betweennhimself and the dangerous bird. He didn't, after all, have time fornthis; his people were waiting. But after flitting away a yard or so, he had to hesitate and looknback. The stork had stopped running and was now jabbing its long rednbill repeatedly into the grass. The toad, Cor realized, didn't havena chance. Not, that is, unless somebody did something. And there was nobody else there, Cornelius knew, but himself. It was some sort of instinct that gripped him then, that causednhis hand to snatch his sword out of its scabbard once again and thatnmade his wings propel him forward to slash at the great stork's longnred legs. As the bird stopped stabbing at the grass to turn angrilynon the Fairy, Cornelius gave in to his built-in desire to defend thenhelpless, no matter who they were; and when he had at last driven thenhuge bird away after getting one of his own wings torn by thensnapping beak, he felt a surge of pride. It had been the Princelynthing to do. Cornelius sheathed his sword and looked over his shoulder at hisndamaged wing. The pride abruptly vanished to be replaced by horror.nHis wing! How would he fly after the Kobold swarm now? This was andisaster! At once he was angry at the toad. I shouldn't have wastednmy time on him, Cor thought bitterly as he started casting about fornsomething he could use as a bandage. It didn't take him long tonspot a shred of cobweb hanging from a bent blade of grass, and henapplied it carefully over the tear. It would hold the membrane innplace while it healed but in the meantime he would not be able to flynmuch, if at all, and certainly not quickly. This was the worst thingnthat could have happened. A shadow suddenly fell upon Cornelius, and he turned to findnhimself not two steps away from the toad, who had emerged from hisnhiding-place – an old snake-hole – and now loomed over thenPrince, blinking down at him coldly. Cor fluttered backward a pacenand, unsheathing his sword yet again, held it out threateninglynbefore him. \"Hold it right there, Toad,\" he warned. The toad (Cor remembered his name now: it was Grundel, Thumbelinanhad told him) didn't budge. His large watery eyes locked with thenPrince's as they stared each other down. The toad was dressed in thensame pink and blue clownlike costume complete with pom hat that henhad worn the previous winter; it would look cheerful on anyone elsenbut on Grundel it just looked oddly grim. The Fairy and the toadnregarded each other wordlessly for a few moments before Cor broke thensilence. \"So,\" he said in a low tone, \"you did survive.\" \" Si ,\" replied Grundel, not quitting the staringnmatch, \"I survive.\" He took another step forward (Cor madena warning motion with his sword). \"You save me,\" the toadnsaid gruffly. Cornelius stiffened. What? \"What?\" he said aloud,nfrowning. For a moment he had forgotten all about the stork – henkept reliving an image of the jealous Grundel menacing him with antorch on the bridge over the dark underground dropoff. The toad gestured after the departed bird. \" Pájaronmaldito try eat me. Have me for almuerzo . You save me.\" It wasn't said in a tone of respect, or gratitude; it wasnjust stated, casually - but all the same the Prince thought hendetected an undertone of malice. Grundel was leaning forward now, looking intently into the Fairy'snface, and Cor realized that not only had he unwittingly lowered hisnsword but the toad had loomed even closer while the latter had beenntrying to collect his thoughts. \"Ah, yes, well...\" Cor edged backward. His own anger hadndissapated to be replaced by confusion – this toad certainly wasn'tnacting the way he'd expected. \"You're, uh...It was nothing,\"nhe concluded lamely at last, taking another step backward. His swordndangled at his side; he wasn't sure if he would need it after all butnwas reluctant to put it away. He felt a need to extricate himselfnfrom the situation; it wouldn't do to rekindle an old fight now ifnhe could avoid it. If the toad was choosing to overlook the fact thatnthey were enemies then all for the better. \"You're injured,\"nhe noted, nodding at blood on the toad's shoulder where the stork hadnpecked him. \"Ees nada ,\" replied Grundel dismissively. Hisnbeady eyes continued to bore into the Fairy's. It was making Cornundeniably uncomfortable. \"Well,\" said Cor carefully. \"I'll be on my way,nthen.\" Eager to depart, he pivoted on his heel and began to walknhastily towards the wood, meaning to cross it and follow the Kobold. But a heavy hand suddenly had his swordarm in a viselike grip, andnCor looked sharply round into those staring eyes again. \"What Fairy Prince's hurry?\" Cor managed not to show his unease. \"I...I am on a quest,\"nhe answered, more grandly this time. \"What for?\" What, exactly, was wrong with this toad? Cor gazed at Grundel withnuncertainty; the toad was watching him intently, like a snake mightnwatch a field mouse, waiting for it to try and make a foolish dashnfor cover which isn't there. \"To save my people,\" he said,nrelieved that his voice was firm. \"They have been takennprisoner. And I must find Thumbelina,\" he added before he couldnstop himself. He closed his mouth with a snap – surely that hadn't been a wise thing to say! But if Grundel was waiting for any news of Thumbelina it didn'tnregister in his wide, expressionless face. He released Cor's arm andnstood up straight, gazing off into the woods as if trying to form ancomplete thought. Cor felt oddly compelled to wait patiently untilnthe toad was done. Finally, Grundel grunted, tapping himself on thenchest. \"I come,\" he announced. \"What?\" said Cornelius again. He hadn't expected that! Grundel shrugged almost boredly. \"You save me, I help you;nhelp look Thumbelina. We go.\" This was just too much. First, the toad didn't seem at allndisturbed to see the Prince he once hated so much, nor seemednparticularly grateful for having his life saved by the same; but nownhe was offering to come along and aid Cor in his plight? Thisnfoul-tempered, jealous, great brute accompanying him intonWho-Knows-What to rescue his Lady Fair? It was preposterous, and Cornopened his mouth at once to refuse. But then something happened. In that moment Prince Cornelius sawnthe spot he was in. Really saw it. Yes, he had been separated fromnThumbelina, true, but more importantly his entire Kingdom had beennsnatched away by evil Faerie-Kin presumably for some sinisternpurpose, to where he had no idea; and he was utterly alone in hisntask to save them. He didn't even have Buzzby. Was it wise tonrefuse an offer of help at this junction? Grundel was as thick asnsilt in a riverbed but he was obviously more powerful than he. If thentoad were loyal, he would be an asset. If he were loyal. These thoughts passed through Cornelius' mind in an instant,nalthough he had the impression he had been standing there with hisnmouth open for a minute or more (but the toad could hardly mind, henthought further, I extended him the courtesy of reflection not anmoment ago) before his curt reply of \"Very well\" rang onnthe still air. The Fairy and the toad silently regarded each other once again. Itnwas impossible for Cornelius to read Grundel's thoughts from thengreat stony face, and he entertained the distinct possibility thatnthere were no thoughts there to read anyway. At last the Princenrealized that his sword was still drawn and he sheathed it. Grundel spoke first. \"We find Thumbelina?\" he blurted,nan expression at last – one of distinct impatience – showing. \"Ornwe stand here like weeds in swamp?\" Cor shook himself, feeling foolish for allowing his mind tonwander. \"Of course,\" he said, and then stopped, his heartnsinking. \"No...we can't,\" he amended regretfully. The toad frowned at him, beginning to look truly irritated.n\"What?\" he argued, spreading his great hands before him.n\"Now you no want look for her?\" Cornelius shook his head, his gaze fixed on a particle of dirt atnhis feet. \"I cannot waste time backtracking,\" he saidnslowly. \"Thumbelina is safe – or I think she is. No...I am thenPrince of the Fairies. My duty is to my people.\" He looked up atnGrundel, trying to appear more in command than he felt. \"I mustnfind where the Kobolds have taken them.\" \"Good, good,\" mused the toad, unperturbed at this changenin plans. \"What is Kobold?\" \"They are evil Fey,\" replied Cor, his tone embittered.n\"They hate Fairies.\" He fully expected Grundel's expressionnto register a look of \"I wonder why\" but was not surprisednwhen it didn't change at all. He recalled the way the Kobolds hadnappeared as if they had been hewn from stone, and added, \"Mynfather told me once that they dwell in the heart of a mountain.\" \"What mountain?\" Grundel replied, frowning. \"Therenno mountain here.\" Cor rubbed his chin, an unconscious imitation of his fathernstroking his beard. \"No,\" he replied. \"We must travelnfar and ask many questions of those we meet. Someone is bound to givenus advice.\" He thought this short speech sounded rather Princelynand felt mildly proud of it. But the speech was lost on Grundel. \"How far?\" demandednthe toad abruptly. \"How many questions? You no make sense.\"nHe paused then, and, incidentally imitating his own father, he rubbednhis thin moustache as he looked Cornelius over. \"Perhaps I justneat you, yes? Better than wasting words standing here like twonfencepost, yes?\" He leaned towards the Fairy then, appraisingnhim for all the world as if he were trying to choose between aunjous or a honey glaze. Cornelius set his jaw. What had he agreed to? \"Do notnthreaten me, Toad,\" he said in a warningly soft tone. \"Ifnyou wish to come along it is your choice, but I will not be bulliednby you. If you do it again, I will have your head.\" He restednhis hand meaningfully on the hilt of his sword without drawing it.n\"Do I make myself clear?\" Grundel, in response, narrowed his eyes at the Fairy, but he didnnot seem in the least intimidated. \"You too much waste words,\"nhe grunted reproachfully. \"I say, I come with you. But too longnwe stand here; you must not think Fairies in much danger or we leavenbefore now. You not good Prince, I think.\" He swelled slightly,neying Cor critically. \"Waste words, waste time! No good! Now,nwhich way we go?\" Trembling with outrage, Cor forcibly removed his hand from hisnswordhilt. He could see now that talking to the thick toad wasngetting them nowhere; although the Prince was too offended to notenthat that was basically what Grundel had just pointed out. \"Thisnway,\" Cornelius replied abruptly, and marched purposely towardsnthe forest without looking back.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Buzzby was all in. He'd kept up a swift, almost frantic pace fornhours, rather ignoring Thumbelina's occasional words of encouragementn– he didn't need encouragement to pursue his master. But it wasnall over now. Thumbelina sat up when she realized that the high-pitched hum ofnBuzzby's wings had turned into a lower-pitched drone as the bumblebeenslowed, then began to descend. She'd been staring at the emptynhorizon so long that her eyes smarted from the wind and she pressednher fingertips to her eyelids as she allowed herself to accept thentruth. Cornelius was gone. Thumbelina had changed much over the past several months. Beforenshe had met Cornelius she had always lived her life in one place,ncarefully watched over by her human adoptive mother and many loyalnanimal friends. She was so well looked-after that when she hadnsuddenly found herself outside her sphere of knowledge, out of sightnof her familiar surroundings, she had easily – much too easily -ngiven in to despair. But when she had nearly allowed that despair tonswallow her up, she had found within herself one last shred of innernfortitude and clung to it with a tenacity she had never known shenhad. Since that time, she had found that her courage had grown. Itncame easily to her now, and the Fairies often remarked to one anothernhow much strength of character their lovely new Princess had. But how strong could she be now? Thumbelina opened her eyes againnto the darkening sky, her vision blurred. Cornelius and all hernpeople were gone. Buzzby landed on a broad leaf, his wings drooped at an unnaturalnangle. Thumbelina dismounted at once and, kneeling before the bee,nput her hands on either side of his long face. \"I'm sorry boy,\"nshe consoled him. And she was sorry. She remained there for a fewnmoments, stroking Buzzby's head. The bee, usually so energetic, laynstill, closing his shiny black eyes. Thumbelina looked up at the twilit sky again, and searched for anlast reserve of hope. I've lost Cornelius before, she reasoned tonherself. Thought he was dead. But he wasn't. He came back to me. Ornrather...She pondered. I met him. At the Vale of the Fairies. Wencould meet again. But where? Thumbelina had a vision of Cornelius being carried off by thatnsinister-looking Faerie-Kin. A Kobold. They were Kobolds. KingnColbert had shown her one in a painting. It was a painting of manyndifferent Fey, all gamboling together. The King explained that oncenthey had all lived together in peace. But that was long ago. ThenKobolds were now of the Dark Fey, and they despised Fairies. Whatnwould they do with her people? If they were taking the Fairiesnsomewhere, wouldn't it be to their own land? Quite possibly not,nbut it was the only lead she had. \"I have to find the home of the Kobolds,\" she whisperednto Buzzby, who gave no indication that he'd heard her. Thumbelina stood up and looked around. The tree she was in stoodnalone in a field, and she thought she could hear a stream nearby. Shencould hear something else, though, and it sounded jarringly familiar.nShe fluttered to a higher leaf and listened. Someone was singing: À la claire fontaine M'en allant promener J'aintrouvé l'eau si belle Que je m'y suis baigne Il y anlongtemps que je t'aime Jamais je ne t'oublierai! Thumbelina's heart lightened. \"Jacquimo!\" she declared,nand flying off of the leaf she headed for a low branch, her wingsntrailing silver. She found her friend swaying to and fro, fussilynadjusting the red feather in his gaudy hat. \"Jacquimo!\" she said again as she lit, and the swallownlooked round. \" Bonjour , Thumbelina!\" the bird greeted hernheartily, sweeping his hat in a wide arc and plopping it back ontonhis sleek head. \"Out on an evening flight, oui? \" \"No.\" Thumbelina fidgeted with her dress and shook hernhead. \"No...Oh...Jacquimo...\" Jacquimo was at her side in an instant. \"What is it, chere? \"nhe demanded, suddenly serious. \"Something has happened?\" Thumbelina nodded, but she resisted the impulse to cover her facenwith her hands and cry into the swallow's harlequin vest. She insteadnlooked Jacquimo in the eye. \"All the Fairies have beennkidnapped,\" she said bravely. This left Jacquimo speechless for a moment, allowing Thumbelina toncontinue. \"I need to find the Mountain of the Kobolds. Jacquimo,nyou found the Vale of the Fairies for me. Will you help me again?\" The swallow shook himself hard, making every feather stand on endnfor a moment before smoothing down again. \"Yes, oui , yes,nof course, of course I will help you!\" He was fairly indignantnthat such a thing could even happen in the first place. \"ThesenKobolds,\" the bird continued, looking at Thumbelina expectantly,n\"you say they steal every Fairy but you?\" Thumbelina kept her voice steady. \"Yes, even Cornelius,\"nshe replied, and Jacquimo looked very grave. \" Tres bien ,\" he said slowly. \"I find thisnplace, this Mountain. I start tonight.\" \"I'll come with you.\" Jacquimo bowed, this time apologetically. \"No, Thumbelina,\"nhe said gently. \"There is no sense in me dragging you all about.nBesides, I think I fly faster alone, oui? \" Thumbelinannodded in understanding. \"But, I take you first, to your dearnMother's house, how about that?\" Thumbelina nodded again, gratefully. \"Yes,\" she said.n\"Yes, I would like that.\" She stepped forward, and paused,nthinking of Buzzby; but she knew full well that the bumblebee couldnfare for himself. She climbed on Jacquimo's back and they were off,nflying high across the fields. Of course Jacquimo knew the way, and they were at the house innless than an hour. He lit on the sill of an open window and hoppedninside. Thumbelina climbed down onto the bureau, surprising hernMother who was standing before it, combing her grey hair. \"Thumbelina!\" exclaimed Mother delightedly, setting downnthe brush. \"And dear Jacquimo! What a surprise.\" Jacquimo gave a great sweeping bow. \" Bon soir ,nMadame,\" he greeted her, \"but, forgive me, I cannot stay.nFarewell.\" And he vanished out the window and into the darknnight. \"Well, Thumbelina, would you like some tea?\" Mother putnout her hand and Thumbelina climbed into it, like she used to donbefore she had wings and how she continued to do, because it was justncomforting to her - like Mother was, and the old farmhouse. Theynbustled to the kitchen and Mother put on a kettle. Thumbelina, on the breakfast table, settled herself on the cushionnwhich was still kept there for her and waited for the tea to be done,nrehearsing in her mind how she would tell her dear Mother what hadnhappened without making her too upset. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o \"What you stop for now?\" Cor rested on a branch, glancing back at the cobweb holding thentear in his wing closed. He bristled at Grundel's sharp question,nrepeated now about ten times as Cor had been forced to landnfrequently to check his bandage. \"I told you, I was injured!\"nhe shouted, feeling his patience snap. \"Saving you, if younrecall.\" Grundel landed heavily on a nearby branch, causing it to shuddernand give up half its leaves. Despite his bout with the stork thensturdy toad had kept up easily, hopping through the trees, asnCornelius had set a rather slow pace. \"What good go slowly?\"nGrundel grunted, pausing to snap a gnat out of the air with hisntongue and gulping it loudly. \"I hop fast, fast - faster thannyou fly.\" \"Well maybe I should hop and you can try flying.\" Corngrinned a little despite himself as he had a mental image of shovingnthe hateful toad off of the branch. \"I could give you your firstnlesson right now.\" The threat sailed right over Grundel's head. \"Flying nongood,\" he announced as if it were a monumental declaration. \"Inhop fast. I pig you on back. We no waste more time.\" At this Cor recoiled. \"Ride on your back?\" he sneered.n\"Forget it! I wouldn't – \" Grundel abruptly sprang onto Cor's branch, which was rather thin,ncausing the Prince to flail wildly to keep from tumbling off. Thentoad suddenly seized him, pinning both arms to his sides. \"You no want my help?\" The toad's tone was low andndangerous. They were nose to nose, and Cor tried futilely to draw hisnsword – this of course was impossible. \"You save life, I helpnyou,\" Grundel went on, his voice rising, and Cor began to feelntruly afraid. \"You think toad no got honor – I think FairynPrince no got honor!\" He squeezed, and Cor gasped. \"Toongood take help from common toad?\" But before Cornelius could argue Grundel released the Prince innsurprise as something yellow, round, and yelling dropped from abovento attach itself to the toad's face. Stunned, Cor could only watch innbewilderment as the toad staggered backwards off of the branch andntumbled noisily to the forest floor, grappling with the thing on hisnhead. \"Prince Cornelius, are you okay?\" Cor looked round and found himself looking into the wide,nconcerned eyes of a small insect child wearing a buttercup as anbonnet. \"That big toad was going to eat you, I saw him!\"nshe went on. \"Daddy was so brave to jump on him, wasn't he?\" The Prince kneeled before the tiny Jitterbug. \"Buttercup,\"nhe said, \"I appreciate your intervention, but I'm not sure thatn– oh no,\" he interrupted himself, looking down at the scenenbelow. Numerous Jitterbugs had joined Buttercup's father, Bramble, andnnow Grundel was surrounded by a teeming swarm, all of them darting innand out to deliver sharp kicks and punches to the surprised toad. Anfew hovered overhead, throwing berries and small stones. None of thisnwas helping Grundel's mood any, as he was bellowing with rage andnsnapping his tongue ineffectively in all directions trying to nab thenbugs, all of whom were luckily dodging. \"No, Prince Cornelius!\" warned Buttercup, clinging tonthe Fairy's elbow as Cor prepared to jump off the branch. \"They'llnchase him away. Let's wait up here.\" \"But I don't want them to chase him away.\" Cor ignorednButtercup's look of confusion as he fluttered to the ground, the tinynJitterbug still clinging to his arm. \"Stop, stop, everyone!\"nhe shouted, struggling to reach Grundel's side. His voice startled the Jitterbugs, making them pause and looknabout in wonder. This gave Grundel opportunity to snatch a nearby bugnin one great webbed hand – it was none other than Gnatty,nButtercup's tiny brother, who had bravely joined the battle despitenwarnings from the older bugs. Gnatty looked into the livid eyes ofnthe toad and screamed. Cor plunged forward, Buttercup dropping to the ground, and henseized Grundel's arm. \"Let him go,\" Cornelius ordered thenamphibian firmly, \"Now.\" His eyes met the toad's, and bothnstood still, once again locked in a staring contest. All the Jitterbugs froze, watching tensely, waiting to see whatnwould happen. Nobody dared breathe. Surely the foul-tempered beastnwould kill both Gnatty and the Prince with one swipe? But the air rang with gasps of amazement as Grundel insteadnobediently released Gnatty, who buzzed to the ground and ran to hisnmother, Briar. The toad continued to stare at Cor, but now with annair of expectance. It was the Fairy who dropped his gaze first. \"Forgive me,\" said the Prince. The Jitterbugs began to murmur among themselves in astonishment.nOne stepped forward. \"Your Highness?\" he promptednrespectfully. It was Bramble. \"What's goin' on?\" Cor took a breath. \"I am apologizing to my companion,\"nhe said steadily, looking at Bramble. \"I have offended him andnhe was right to be angry with me.\" As the Jitterbugs lookednaround at each other in some confusion, Cor turned back to Grundel,ndrawing himself up straight to look the toad in the eye. Grundel wasnwatching him with arms folded. \"I have been arrogant,\" thenFairy went on. \"We are equals, and I do want yournhelp. And...I believe I have been wasting time. You were rightnto be impatient.\" He waited, unsure if Grundel would disapprovenof such a long speech. But this time the toad merely nodded. \" Bueno ,\" hensaid, clearly placated, and Cor, who hadn't realized he had beennholding his breath, let it out in a soft whoosh. Bramble coughed. \"We apologize as well,\" he spoke up,naddressing Grundel, though clearly afraid to look the hulkingnamphibian in the face. \"We...well, we did think...I mean,nafter all...\" \"We thought you were gonna eat him!\" piped up Gnattynloudly. \"Gnatty!\" gasped Briar. But Grundel seemed not to hear. \"Is getting dark,\" henpointed out. \"Is soon owls come. No good stay out in open.\" Cor nodded. \"Right again,\" he said. \"We'll findnshelter for the night and tomorrow find someone who knows about thenKobolds.\" \"Your Highness,\" said Briar, \"has somethingnhappened?\" \"Yes.\" Cornelius turned to her. \"A great tragedy,nI'm afraid.\" Buttercup gasped. \"Not...Thumbelina...?\" She glancedninvoluntarily at Grundel, who had suddenly, it seemed, becomenterribly bored with his surroundings. \"No, she got away.\" \"From what?\" prompted Bramble. \"The Kobolds,\" replied Cor gravely. \"The Koboldsnhave stolen away my people. Only Thumbelina and I escaped.\" This statement of course resulted in gasps of dismay all around.n\"But where is Thumbelina?\" asked Gnatty. \"I don't know,\" admitted Cornelius. \"But...she'sngot Buzzby with her. Maybe she went to her mother's house.\" \"You could meet her there!\" suggested Buttercup, but shenfrowned when Cor shook his head. \"No,\" he said sadly. \"Her house lies in the wrongndirection. My people come first. Thumbelina will have to wait.\"nSuddenly, he brightened. \"Thistle,\" he said, turning to antall, thin Jitterbug. \"Can you find Thumbelina for me, tell hernthat I've gone to look for the mountain where the Kobolds dwell, andnthat...\" He faltered. \"...And that, I'll see her soon?\"nHe hoped that wouldn't be an untruth. Thistle saluted smartly. \"Yes, Your Highness! Right away!\"nAnd he zipped off, right then and there. \"And Briar, can you show us to a safe place to pass thennight?\" \"Of course,\" replied Briar, casting an uneasy glance atnGrundel, who still stood behind the Prince silently, once againnbeginning to show signs of impatience. She mentally went over nearbynhollow logs and stumps, trying to pick out a suitable one. In anmoment she nodded. \"This way, then.\" Ushering her children along before her, Briar led Cor and Grundelnthrough the trees as the light faded. The rest of the Jitterbugs madena pretense of wandering away, but nearly every one of them ended upndoubling back and trailing after the group furtively. Not one of themntrusted that big toad to not harm their beloved Thumbelina's handsomenPrince, and they would take it in turns to keep watch during thennight in case something happened. When they at last reached the large, rotted log, Grundel thumpednit with one fist as if to test the solidarity of its structure. Whennnothing crumbled he grunted in satisfaction and scrambled on top ofnthe log rather than inside without saying anything to anybody, andnheaded to the other end to help himself to an overhanging branch ofnwild raspberries. Briar drew the Prince close to her, and the children leaned innautomatically to listen. \"You don't really trust that greatnbrute, do you?\" she whispered urgently. \"After all he'sndone? Why, he could gobble you up in your sleep! He could snap younlike a twig! He could - \" Cor spoke up before she could tic off any other unpleasant ways tondie at the hands of a toad (the children's eyes had gotten verynround). \"He may be a brute,\" he said, \"and his tempernmay be vile, but I'll need all the help I can get when I reach thenMountain of the Kobolds if I want to free my people.\" \"But surely one toad won't be enough! You'll need...you'llnneed an army, won't you?\" \"Yes,\" replied Cor, nodding. \"I shall. But first Inmust find the Kobolds, and that will be no easy task. Mynfather told me their Mountain lies far, far from here, beside anmighty river.\" Briar shook her head. \"But there are no rivers near here,\"nshe said. \"Streams and rivulets, yes – but they go every whichnway. One might lead to the right river – but how will you knownwhich one?\" \"I have hope that someone, somewhere, will be able to tell menthat.\" The conviction in Cor's voice encouraged the Jitterbugs, and Briarninclined her head. \"Then it must be so,\" she said. \"Sleepnwell, Your Highness, and good luck.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Good night!\" shouted Buttercup and Gnatty in chorus asnCornelius strode into the musty log. Cor settled down on a patch of moss beneath a hole, and gazed upnat the few stars not concealed by the forest canopy. He wanted tonsleep, he knew he needed all the rest he could get before returningnto his quest in the morning; but too much had happened today to letnhim shut down his mind and drift off. The mass kidnapping of thenFairies was the most catastrophic thing to happen to his people sincenthe great Pestie Invasion of his great-great-great grandfather'sntime, when the Fairies had managed to drive off a horde of the punynbut determined Dark Fey after suffering heavy losses. Well, to benfair, this was really much worse. Cornelius groaned and closed hisneyes. Couldn't this have happened when someone else was in charge?nHe cringed at the un-Princely thought and rubbed the bridge of hisnnose, imagining what King Colbert would say if he knew what his sonnwas thinking at this moment: that he wished he could go back and findnThumbelina and just hide away somewhere with her, to at least livenout his years with the woman he loved... But even as he tried to beat that cowardly thought from his headnhe remembered Thumbelina's angry face that afternoon, how she hadnraised her voice and thrown his gift back at him in a fury. Cor'snhand trailed over and inside his pocket, and he drew out thenoffending diamond necklace. What was wrong with it? He held it in thenstarlight. It was a lovely, tastefully cut stone, which glitterednenticingly. Sure, it was as big as both his fists together, but shenwas a Princess, for crying out loud! Her people expected her to lookngrand! He turned the diamond over and over in his hands as it glintednin the faint light. The light suddenly vanished as something blocked the hole overnCor's head. \"What you got there?\" demanded a gruff voice,nand Cornelius looked up sharply at a looming green face. \"It's Thumbelina's,\" he retorted defensively, holding itnnear the floor with one hand to try and place it as far from the toadnas possible. But to his horror there was a pink flash and thennecklace vanished in a spray of slime, Grundel disappearing from viewna split-second later. Cor shot up through the hole as the toad spatnthe necklace out into his hand to look at it with interest. \"Give that back! \" the Prince shouted furiously,nmaking a grab for the diamond. Grundel jerked it away just in time,nand Cor flitted about angrily to the toad's other side. \"Thatnbelongs to Thumbelina!\" A faint smile tugged at the corners of Grundel's wide mouth. \"Thennwhy you got it, eh?\" he asked, finding this new game rathernamusing. Cor made another grab and the toad hopped backward nimbly. \"That's none of your business, Toad!\" \"Oho!\" grinned Grundel, leaping to the other end of thenlog as Cor made another grab. \"Was gift, yes? She no like, yes?\"nHe waved the necklace enticingly, hoping to goad Cor into snatchingnat it again; but Cor had paused mid-dive to stare at Grundel in somensurprise; the toad had fallen on the right track very quickly. \"What did you say?\" Somewhat disappointed that the game had ended so soon, Grundel satnback and swung the necklace from one hand. He made a show of rubbingnhis chin and rolling his eyes as if deep in thought. \"She say,nlet me think...She say, is too big, yes? And then,\" he went onnwith relish as Cor dropped to the log, too stunned to stay in thenair, \"she... throw it at you!\" And he threw thennecklace straight into Cor's chest, the Fairy only just managing tongrab the chain before the jewel could fall and tumble off the log. \"How...\" Cor floundered, aghast, as the toad begannchuckling with real amusement. \"How did you know that?\" Grundel grinned, putting his hands on his knees. \"Is women ,\"nhe replied, closing his eyes and nodding sagely. \"Is all alike.nI travel, all over world, and everywhere women is the same. Younlisten, I know, all woman this way.\" Cornelius was frankly floored. He could not have possiblynexpected, of all the people in the world, this vile toad to be annexpert in lover's spats. If he was so familiar with women, shouldn'tnhe have known Thumbelina wouldn't appreciate being kidnapped andnforced to marry someone she'd never met? Cor stood, staring down atnthe diamond for a moment, then slowly put it back in his pocket. Henwalked towards Grundel, who watched him silently but with lingeringnamusement, and sat near him. Eventually Cor spoke. \"Why didn't she like it?\" Grundel put on a long-suffering look. \"I say I know how womannis. I not say, I know why.\" Cornelius grunted and leaned back on his hands. \"If you did,nyou'd be the most famous person in the world.\" The toad laughed, and Cornelius smiled faintly. \"So, Thumbelina have fiery temper, eh?\" Cor looked sharply at Grundel and his smile vanished as hensuddenly remembered that this was very the toad who had coveted hisnbeloved to the extreme of trying to kill him to win her. It didn'tnseem proper to say anything about what kind of wife Thumbelina turnednout to be. But it wouldn't do to irritate the toad, now that he'dngotten in a pleasant mood for once. So Cor tactfully changed the subject. \"You're the one with anfiery temper,\" he said slyly, raising an eyebrow at hisncompanion. \"Ees nada ,\" replied the toad lightly, completelynun-offended. \"I no temper. Look how I get along with FairynPrince, yes?\" Cornelius raised the other eyebrow. \"Is that an insult?\"nhe smiled. \" Por supuesto no .\" Grundel continued to grin. \"Isnno insult. I only wonder, after you try kill me.\" Cornelius's spine went rigid. \"You tried to kill me too,\"nhe pointed out. \"I was starting to get the impression you hadnforgotten what happened last winter.\" \"I no forget. I hear Thumbelina marry Fairy Prince. At firstnI no like, but then I glad.\" \"You...were?\" Cor was mystified. \"Why?\" Grundel shrugged. \"You Prince ,\" he said, wavingnone hand airily. \"I am a toad.\" Cor frowned. \"Hey now,\" he said sternly. \"I thoughtnwe agreed that we're equals.\" And after that fuss he made! henthought. \"Yes,\" replied the toad, nodding. \"But...she isnPrincess now. She marry me, she have hard time. Life on road, isnhard, is hard work. She get grey hair, get little wrinkles aroundneyes, think she fat. She be like Mama: dye hair strange color she nonborn with, wear makeup like plaster, and always on diet that nevernend. Is not good life.\" Cornelius was silent for a minute after taking this all in. Henwatched the trees sway overhead. \"You do love her, then,\"nhe said quietly. \"You must, to be glad she's not yours.\" Grundel sobered and peered round at the Prince. \"I no lovenThumbelina,\" he said simply. Cor looked at him. \"It sounds like you do,\" he said gently. \"No.\" The toad turned to look stubbornly at the stars.n\"Is mistake. Mama says, is my trouble. I... apasionado ...Toonmuch feeling.\" He hesitated searchingly. \"I no know word,\"nhe admitted at length. \"Passionate,\" guessed Cornelius. \"Well, you are,nthat.\" Grundel grunted in acceptance. \"But you surely havenno trouble meeting women?\" Cornelius went on impishly, feelingnbolder. \"I mean, Thumbelina told me about your family and hownyou travel everywhere entertaining people. She said you seemed verynsuccessful.\" Grundel blinked rapidly a couple of times when Cor brought up hisnfamily but he shook his head. \"Is no trouble toad meet woman,\"nhe said with forced energy, waving an arm. \"Is toad womenneverywhere. In pond, in stream, in swamp. Everywhere. Have only tonsing.\" \"What do you mean, 'sing'?\" \"Toad have many song,\" Grundel explained. \"Song fornfind food, song for help, song for meet women.\" \"Do you mean croaking?\" \"Is not croaking!\" The toad bristled. \"Is song!\" \"Really?\" Cornelius tried to sound especially interestednso Grundel would not get too angry. \"And this...singing, itnbrings the lady toads in droves, does it?\" Grundel allowed himself a self-satisfied smirk. \"Usually.\" \"Show me.\" The toad blinked. \"There no lady toads in forest,\" henargued, flustered but trying to sound offended. Cornelius didn'tnfall for it, though. \"It doesn't matter,\" Cor assured him. \"It's onlyna demonstration.\" He smiled encouragingly when Grundel gave himnan incredulous look. \"Oh come on, next time I'm in a swamp I'dnlike to know if I'm overhearing the Dating Network. Just do it once,\"nhe pleaded as Grundel continued to hesitate. The toad threw Cor a defeated look. \"Onstage I get manynrequest, but this is the strangest, I think,\" he muttered. \"Allnright, I do, because you save life – But once only.\" Hensuddenly leapt over Cor's head to the far end of the log and squattednthere a moment, his throat pulsing. Cor watched in rapt fascination. Suddenly Grundel raised his head and let loose with the loudest,ndeepest croak Cornelius had ever heard; it rumbled through the forestnand startled the watching Jitterbugs above. Their frightened jumpsndislodged several leaves, making it appear as if the mighty croak hadnbeen a solid thing that had swept along through the branches knockingnthings down. The sound seemed to linger about them for a momentnbefore fading off into the distance; this was followed by a hollownsilence, as if the very forest were appalled that such a thing couldnhave ever occurred within its boundaries. \"Very romantic,\" grinned Cor. Grundel turned to him, looking smug. \"Is good, yes,\" henstated rather than asked. \"Maybe you can teach it to me so I can do it the next time Insee Thumbelina,\" added Cor, suddenly feeling a little glum. \"Andnif I'm lucky she won't throw anything at me,\" he added in annundertone. Grundel chuckled again. \"I do not think it would work,\"nhe remarked. Cor smiled wanly and shook his head. \"You're probably right -nI think if I made that noise my mother would confine me to bed for anmonth.\" Grundel laughed aloud but Cornelius felt suddenlyndepressed, and he sighed morosely. \"You thinking she never forgive you. You thinking, she madnforever.\" Cor sighed a second time. The toad was good. \"You didn'tnsee her face ,\" he muttered, clasping his hands across hisnknees and resting his forehead on them. Grundel rolled his eyes heavenward. \"Is that what bother you?nLook,\" he said, giving a small hop and landing with a hollownthump at Cor's side, \"you think right now, Thumbelina sittingnsomewhere looking at the stars and thinking, 'That Fairy Prince, hennothing but idiota grande , I should have married handsomentoad'?\" Cor spluttered with laughter and hastily caught himself. \"SorrynI – uh, no. I mean, no offense – \" \"Ees nada ,\" the toad assured him with anotherneasy wave. \"She no think that. She thinking...She thinking ofnlast time she was with her Fairy Prince and he say – \" herenGrundel stood up tall and put both hands over his heart as he gazedndramatically down at an imaginary Thumbelina – \"'I love you, Thumbelina. I so glad you no marry that rich good-looking toad.nHere is a teensy-weensy little diamond – '\" Cornelius wheezed with laughter. \"All right,\" henexclaimed at length, wiping his eyes with the back of one hand asnGrundel grinned down at him, \"I get it.\" He chuckled for anmoment more before turning a solemn eye on the toad, who had wanderednoff to the overhanging raspberry branch. \"You know, you'renpretty smart,\" he said with feeling. \"I take backneverything I've ever said or thought about you.\" He paused. \"I'dnstill like to learn that Lady Call, though.\" \"Pfaw,\" grunted Grundel, tugging off a berry as big as anFairy's head and watching the branch bounce upward. \"You wantnimpress Thumbelina, you use words.\" \"You mean...tell her how beautiful she is? Tell her...hownwonderful...how kind – \" Grundel tossed the berry at the Prince, who caught it and took anbite, suddenly realizing how hungry he was. \"Is no good justnsay,\" the toad admonished. \"Is just talk.\" Chewing, Cor pondered. He swallowed. \"You mean, don't justncroak when I can sing?\" Grundel nodded empathetically. \"Sing, si , sing!\"nhe exclaimed, holding one arm aloft dramatically. \"Sing what younfeel, and others feel it too.\" And, swept up in the moment, henburst into song. The Royal Court of the Fairies has its own opera, and they arenexceptionally talented – possibly more so by human standards, asnFairies as individuals more often have fine singing voices thannhumans and so those Fairies that sing professionally have honed theirnskills to a flawless edge. The voice of the toad Grundel, ringed withnemotion, struck Cor in an instant as being possibly one of the bestnhe had ever heard: La mia letizia infondere vorrei nel suo bel core! Vorreindestar co' palpiti del mio beato amore tante armoniennell'etere quanti pianete egli ha: ah! ir seco al cielo, ednergermi dove mortal non va! Most Fairies don't travel far by human standards (being so muchnsmaller), and therefore are almost never multi-lingual. Corneliusndidn't understand the Italian words of the opera, but they spoke tonhim nonetheless; of one who longs to tell another how he feels. Around and above the pair, forest animals stirred from their sleepnfor the second time and listened, surprised but somewhat pleased tonoverhear this performance (especially after that awful noise fromnbefore); and the Jitterbugs on watch, being sensitive creatures,nsighed and closed their eyes and listened harder than anyone. When Grundel finished grandly, Cor gazed in silence for a momentnand then leapt to his feet, dropping the forgotten berry. \"Spectacular!\" he gasped, applauding belatedly. \"Younhave a marvelous voice!\" \"Ees nada ,\" replied the toad modestly, though hengave a short bow. \"I don't think I've ever heard better,\" insisted Cor,nstepping forward. \"You must...you simply must play thenPalace!\" Again, mention of going back to normal life among hisnpeople made him hesitate, but he went on bravely, \"My mothernwould adore it.\" And indeed, Queen Tabitha was an immensenfan of the Royal Opera. \"Certainly you've performed for royaltynbefore.\" \"Eh? Oh, no.\" Grundel, who had been trying to hide hisngrowing pleasure at the unexpected praise, frowned slightly. \"Mama'snact is not kind you take before King.\" Cor shook his head. \"No, not that ,\" he said, \"Inmean... you . You know...the opera. Have you considered joiningna troupe? You'd have no trouble getting in. Perhaps,\" he went onnquickly, \"our own Royal Op – \" \"No,\" said the toad so sharply that Cor was brought upnshort. \"My Mama...she no like opera. She say it too...\" Hentrailed off, evidently searching for words again. But Cornelius didn't even try to guess at this one. \"Hasnshe not heard you?\" he exclaimed in disbelief. \"Forgetnthat flashy showboat; with a talent like that, you'd be – \" \"NO,\" repeated Grundel, so firmly that it bordered onndangerous. Cor fell silent at once, wondering what he had said wrong.nBut the toad, turning away, did not give him a chance to ask. \"Isnlate, we journey far tomorrow.\" And with that short speechnGrundel hopped off of the log and disappeared inside. Cornelius stood alone for a few moments, confused and a littlendisturbed. At last he fluttered down and lay at the opposite end ofnthe log Grundel had taken.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three \"You should sleep, dear. It's very late.\" Thumbelina looked round into her Mother's anxious face. \"Inwill, Mother,\" she said. \"I – I just want to sit up anwhile longer.\" Mother lowered her eyes; a small sigh escaped her. The matronlynwoman knew there was nothing more she could do to help her daughternwith her worry. \"All right, Thumbelina,\" she said, andnpicked a lit candle up from its place on the desk. \"I will seenyou in the morning.\" \"Good night, Mother.\" Thumbelina waited for her mother to close the door behind hernbefore turning back to the window. She sat on the sill bathed innstarlight, looking out at the quiet landscape beyond the small farm.nShe just couldn't stop expecting Cornelius to appear triumphantly,nannouncing that he had found her at last – but no, it wasn't shenwho needed rescuing! And yet, what could she do until Jacquimonreturned with news? Mother was right: it was very late, close to morning now. Perhapsnshe had best go to bed – it wouldn't do to be unrested ifnJacquimo should arrive after sunrise triumphant. But just as she had turned to fly into the dark room, a voicencaught her by surprise: \"Princess Thumbelina! PrincessnThumbelina! I bring news of Prince Cornelius!\" Thumbelina spun about with a gasp as the Jitterbug Thistle lit,nbreathless, on the sill beside her. \"What news?\" shenblurted urgently. Thistle gazed at her. \"Prince Cornelius quests for thenMountain of the Kobolds,\" he recited formally. \"He wishesnhis Princess well and will see her upon his return.\" Thumbelina opened her mouth to argue but thought better of it. Shenwas about to inform Thistle that she had no intention of dawdlingnabout her mother's house, waiting for the Prince to take all thenresponsibility for their people himself; but she didn't want thenJitterbug relaying that to Cornelius, who would only worry himselfnover her, and perhaps turn back. No, he would just have to bensurprised to see her at the Mountain, at which time it would be toonlate to order her to go home and wait for him. Thumbelina eyed Thistle, who appeared to be on the verge of sayingnsomething else. \"Is that the whole message?\" she promptedngently. Thistle fidgeted, twisting his hat in his hands. \"Well I –nEr, that is to say...Yes, that is the message the Prince gave me...\" \"But there's something else, isn't there?\" Thistle couldn't lie to his Princess. \"I – Yes.\" Henwet his lips. \"It...It's that toad , Thumbelina,\" henblurted, forgetting himself and neglecting to use the Royal title. Thumbelina gave a start. \"Toad?\" she repeated numbly. \"Er – yes. You know the one...Well,\" he went on asnThumbelina gave him a sharp look, \"he's accompanying the Princenon his quest.\" \"He's what? \" Thumbelina clapped a hand over hernmouth and spun around, half expecting her mother to come stumblingninto the room at the sudden outburst. But when it became evident thatnshe had not been heard, the Princess turned back to the uneasynmessenger. \"What – Do you know why? \" \"No, Your Highness,\" answered Thistle, collectingnhimself. \"They are traveling together. But oh!\" henexclaimed as Thumbelina stared at him, \"He is savage! We all sawnhim try to kill the Prince – \" Thumbelina took to the air, hovering several inches above thensill. \"You will take me to Cornelius at once! \" shencommanded. But Thistle only cowered. \"It is only hours until sunrise,nYour Highness,\" he gasped. \"It took longer than that for mento reach you. We would not make it before they departed.\" And hendrooped miserably. Realizing how she was behaving, Thumbelina at once sank down tonthe sill and put an arm around her friend. \"I didn't mean tonshout, Thistle,\" she apologized hastily. \"I just...It'snjust that...Cornelius...with that toad ...\" She shook hernhead. \"He'll murder him...He can't be trusted...Oh,nCornelius...\" Thistle said nothing as Thumbelina trailed off. At length thenPrincess stood up straight. \"Thistle,\" she said, \"thank you for coming all thisnway. You are a good friend.\" She smiled at the Jitterbug, and,nrelaxing, he smiled back, and bowed. \"Anything for you,\" he said. Thumbelina nodded. \"Go on home,\" she told him. \"Inwill wait here for...for Cornelius to return.\" Thistle hesitated. \"Good night, then, Princess Thumbelina.\" \"Good night.\" o o o o o o o o o o o o o o Traveling by toadback was, without a doubt, the most wretchednexperience Cornelius could remember ever having to endure – andnthat included all his childhood music lessons combined. There was thenjarring launch upward, followed by the sickening drop, and concludednby the doubly-jarring forward landing; and then the whole processnrepeated itself. Grundel leapt along the ground, swerving around thentrees, hopping on all fours; and as he occasionally ricocheted off ofntree trunks he often traveled through the air sideways. Cornelius wasnhaving a hard time not only hanging on, his arms wrapped around thenbig toad's thick neck, but refraining from crying out, which wouldn'tnbe very Princely. They'd left the hollow log at daybreak. Not wanting to bother hisnhosts, Cornelius had roused the snoring toad carefully, fearingnGrundel's temper; but the toad had not said a word to him allnmorning. Cornelius had mutely nodded when the toad pointed to his ownnback and grabbed on; and every moment since then had been a trial. When Grundel stopped abruptly and stood up on a patch of dirt Cornsimply slid off without ceremony and lay there flat out, his eyesnclosed, wondering if it were possible to know if one were suddenlynmissing an internal organ or two. He was now deeply grateful theynhadn't stopped for breakfast. Finally, realizing that severalnminutes had gone by, he opened his eyes and sat up. Grundel was squatting a few paces away, his back to the Prince.nCor got up slowly and wobbled over to him. The toad, hearing him approach, did not turn around. \"Wenreach stream,\" he grunted, pointing. They had. The stream, flowing east, stretched off in eitherndirection through the wood. A stream leads to a river, thought Cornelius. \"Look there,\" said the Prince suddenly, now pointingnhimself. \"A boat. Just what we need!\" A low-lying boat was anchored on the far side of the stream innsome standing water. Instead of a cabin a canvas was stretched allnaround the center of the deck, concealing some kind of large roomnfrom view. \"Eh?\" Grundel half-turned. \"What for need boat?\" Cornelius paced back and forth along the bank, thinking. \"Wenneed to follow the water anyway to find the Kobolds,\" henexplained. \"Why not travel in a boat? It would be the fastestnway.\" Grundel didn't look too keen on the idea. \"Not that boat,\"nhe objected. Cor blinked at him. What now? \"And why not?\" he asked.n\"The owner might let us use it; you never know until you ask.\"nGrundel didn't reply. \"After all,\" Cor felt compelled tonadd, \"I am a Prince, and this is a Royal Mission. I'mnsure they'll understand.\" At the toad's continued silence,nCornelius tossed his head. \"All right then,\" he said,nstriding toward the water's edge, \"stay here while I talk to thenowner. If they agree to let us use the boat, I'll wave you over.\"nAnd with that he fluttered, mindful of his wing, over the water tonlight on the deck of the boat. There was no one in sight, but it still being early Cor wasnhopeful there might be someone below deck. \"Good morning!\"nhe called, walking around the deck and patting the canvas. \"Anyonenon board? Please, I need your help.\" He listened; someone wasndefinitely moving below. \"I need your boat,\" he saidnloudly. No reply. \"Please open up!\" he cried impatiently,nstanding before a door-like flap. The flap was violently ripped open and Cor fluttered backwards innalarm from the nightmarish vision which stumbled on deck and stoodnover the Prince, gazing at him rapturously. It appeared to be female,nbut her species was entirely undecipherable: she was draped in anformless housecoat and her face was smeared over with bright yellownpaste. Her pink hair was wound in curlers and a sleepmask was pushednup on her forehead. Below, fuzzy pink slippers adorned feet on thenends of long green legs. \" Cuál es éste? \" cried the creature,nflailing wildly. \"Is emergency? Is boat on fire?\" Shenstaggered forward and Cor nearly fell over the railing in his effortnto back away. \"Are you here to rescue me?\" And shenwrapped her long arms around him in a crushing embrace. \"Oooh,nyou so valiente! \" she squealed, pressing her cheek to hisnand getting yellow paste in one of his eyes. She set him down andnmimed a swooning fit. \"I am fainting! Carry me to shore, my pequeño héroe! \" Cor scrambled out of the way as the woman crashed to the deck. \"Inbeg your pardon, Ma'am!\" he blurted, scooping the yellow stuffnoff of his face and flinging it aside. \"There's no fire –nI...I didn't mean to frighten you – \" But the woman had scrambled nimbly to her feet and was advancingnon him again, her eyes gleaming. \"Well, no problema , my el hermoso ,\" she purred, clasping her long hands besidenher face and blinking rapidly. \"We can make our own firen– \" \"Mama, what is that thing?\" Cor looked round frantically expecting a new threat as a toadnwearing a French Legionnaire's uniform stepped through the flap andnscratched under his hat in some confusion at the scene before him. The woman grabbed Cornelius and thrust him behind hernpossessively. \"Go back inside, Gringo, and play with yournbrother,\" she snapped. \"Mama has a visitor.\" And shenleered around at the Prince, who suddenly felt as ill as he'd beennwhen he was being ferried through the forest not a quarter of an hournago. But Gringo didn't go back inside. \"Hey Mozo!\" henshouted through the door, one hand cupped around his mouth, \"Mamancaught another one!\" \" Please , Ma'am,\" begged Cor, but that was as farnas he got before a second toad, this one wearing a harlequin'sncostume, appeared on deck. \"Mama, what is that thing?\" thennew toad parroted his brother. \"I think it's some kind of bug,\" Gringo said. \"Maybe a wasp?\" suggested Mozo. \"Hey Mama,\" said Gringo, \"can we eat your newnboyfriend?\" \"GO INSIDE!\" screamed Mama. Mozo pouted. \"Mama never shares.\" Gringo nodded innagreement. \"I SAID – \" But Mama froze in mid-threat, her mouthnslightly ajar, as she looked past her sons at the ship's prow. Cornfollowed her gaze and, for what he was sure would be the only time innhis life, was relieved to see Grundel climbing aboard. \" No puede ser ,\" whispered Mama, her hand to hernmouth, while Mozo and Gringo pressed against each other in fright asnif a hurricane was about to crush the whole boat. Cor ducked around Mama Toad and looked over his shoulder at thencowed threesome; then he turned back to Grundel, who was silentlynwringing out his sodden hat. \"This is your family's showboat!\"nhe guessed immediately. \"Why didn't you say so back onnthe bank?\" While Cor waited for Grundel to offer an explanation, Mamansuddenly burst out rapidly, \"Well, so many things to do: I mustnwash my hair and fold the towels and count the dinero and...sew! Yes, I must sew something.\" And with that shenvanished into the tent. Cornelius blinked. Mozo and Gringo glanced at each other uneasily; Mozo proddednGringo and the latter stumbled forward. \"Hey, bro,\" Gringonsaid with a forced smile, \"back so soon?\" Mozo stepped upnbeside Gringo, adding, \"We about to leave without you.\" Grundel grunted incoherently and slapped his hat back on withoutnlooking at anyone. \"So, who's your amigo? \" prompted Mozo. Grundel still didn't look at anybody. \"This Fairy Prince,\"nhe said abruptly. The effect of this introduction was electric. Two toad jaws allnbut hit the deck as Mozo and Gringo gawped at Cornelius in shock. \"Um, hello,\" offered Cor gingerly. \"What you doing with Fairy Prince?\" Mozo demandednloudly, and Gringo promptly clapped a webbed hand over his brother'snmouth. \" Cállate! \" hissed Gringo urgently. \"Younwant Mama to hear?\" Cornelius shrugged. \"Would that be so bad?\" he asked,nadding as he reddened slightly, \"I think she kind of likes me.\" \"No, no, no, no, no!\" cried Gringo, oblivious to Mozo'snefforts to free himself from the headlock Gringo had him in. \"Mamanhate you! She find out who you are, she feed you to pescados! \" \"I...don't understand,\" frowned Cor, watching asnGrundel skulked off, disappearing around the back of the tentednstage. Mozo wrenched himself out from under his brother's arm. \"Younmarry Thumbelina!\" he whispered, glancing furtively at the tent.n\"Mama wanted Thumbelina for show.\" \"Mama say many bad things about you,\" addednGringo. Cor's frown turned to a scowl. \"Your mother was wrong to trynto force Thumbelina to join your act,\" he said, trying toncontrol the volume of his voice. \"Besides, Grundel says hendoesn't want to marry Thumbelina anymore.\" Mozo and Gringo seemed tickled by the very idea, and begannsniggering at once. \"Did that idiota grande tell younthat?\" sneered Mozo. \"He just sore loser.\" \"Although nobody can blame Thumbelina for running away.\"nGringo shrugged. \"Grundel, he uglier than old catfish.\" Andnhe pulled the corners of his mouth down grotesquely, his tonguenlolling. Mozo howled with laughter. Affronted, Cornelius spun on his heel and marched up to the tent'snflap. \"Mrs. Toad!\" he called out forcefully. \"I neednpermission to borrow your craft! This is urgent business!\" Mama Toad's face, the yellow paste gone and makeup applied (thoughnher hair remained in curlers) appeared at the flap. \"What thisnyou say?\" she asked in some surprise. Cor took a steadying breath; the two brothers were both cacklingnlike hyenas behind him. \"There has been a catastrophe,\" henexplained steadily. \"I need to travel along the river and Inrequest the use of this vessel. I promise to compensate you for yourncooperation.\" When Mama just blinked at him in confusion, Cornswitched tactics. \"I need your boat,\" he said shortly.n\"I'll pay you.\" Mama understood that. \"Why not you say so!\" shenexclaimed, throwing the flap wide to reveal an outfit Queen Tabithanwould have never permitted in the Palace. She tore the curlers out ofnher hair and tossed them away. \"You tell my sons what to do.nMozo! Gringo!\" she shouted, clapping her hands at the two toadsnwho were gasping and clutching their sides, \"Stop that jaleo and help our guest! I make breakfast, okay?\" she addressed Cornwith lowered eyelids as Mozo and Gringo sobered reluctantly. \"Younlike.\" Cor managed a weak smile as Mama leered at him, puttingnone long finger under his chin. Then she withdrew and closed thenflap. Cornelius exhaled with relief and turned to the brothers. \"We need to get this boat into the stream,\" he said.n\"We'll need some reeds.\" As Mozo and Gringo pulled a reed apiece out of the water besidenthe boat Cornelius pulled out two and walked round to the other sidenof the tent. Grundel was squatting on the other side of the stagenglowering at the near bank. \"Here,\" said Cor, holding out one of the reeds. \"We'rengoing to punt out into the stream. What's the matter?\" he saidnimpatiently when Grundel didn't even look at him. \"Look, Indon't understand you,\" Cor went on, his tone chafing. \"Inthought you were helping me.\" Grundel slowly turned his head to look balefully at the Prince;nthen he unhurriedly stood, took the reed, and pushed it into thenbank. Cor followed suit with the remaining reed but the boat didn'tnmove out into the current until Mozo and Gringo joined them; then thencraft slid along the stream at a respectable pace. When the four men had gotten the boat steady, Gringo elbowed Mozo.n\"Hey Fairy Prince,\" Gringo said slyly as they both grinned.n\"Did our bro tell you what happened after you push him off thatnbridge?\" Cornelius didn't argue the point about pushing Grundel off ofnthe bridge – the toad had pulled him off – and onlynsaid shortly, \"No.\" He glanced curiously at Grundel toncheck his reaction: the big toad was expressionless as ever but hisnknuckles had turned white as he gripped his punt with unnecessarynforce. Cor recalled how he had managed to break the toad's grip onnhis arm before reaching the bottom of the cavern; and he had been sonintent on finding Thumbelina that he hadn't stuck around to evennlisten if Grundel had met his end. It was only known that he hadnfallen a long way and it was unlikely anyone could survive an impactnlike that. \" Well ,\" Gringo went on with relish, \"Mole'snhole near stream, you know, so the deeper parts are all full of muckn– \" \"And Grundel he so fat he hit the mud and SPLAT – \"nMozo had taken up the tale – \"he sink like pesado rocknto the bottom.\" Both Mozo and Gringo started laughing all over again. \"Itntake him all spring to dig his sorry poto out,\" wheezednGringo, slapping his leg. Mozo leaned on Gringo as he was weakened with glee. \"He spitnup mud for a week!\" For a moment Cor was torn between pity (to be buried alive for annentire season!) and amusement (\" SPLAT! \"); but beforenhe could fully register either there was a loud cracking sound behindnhim as Grundel, positively livid, broke his punt in half. Throwingnthe two pieces aside he howled with rage and hurled himself at hisnbrothers, pinning them to the deck. The sudden violence frankly unnerved Cornelius, and he dropped hisnreed in shock as the three toads rolled about, Grundel banging hisnspluttering brothers' heads alternately on the deck and roaring likena bull. The Prince whipped out his sword, sure he would need tonprevent a murder or two before it was too late. The timely appearance of Mama Toad bearing a tray of food foundnCornelius flitting above the brawl, looking for the best place toninsert his blade. But instead of screaming and flinging rice andnchunks of stewed cattails everywhere, Mama merely stamped onenhigh-heeled foot in impatience. \" Muchachos! \" shenadmonished, and Grundel abruptly stopped trying to put Mozo andnGringo's heads through the deck. \"Stop that at once! We have anguest!\" \"Sorry Mama,\" chorused Mozo and Gringo. Grundel, stillngripping his brothers' collars, said nothing. Cornelius still hoverednabove them, at a loss; but at that moment he noticed something. \"Mrs.nToad...\" he began. \"I know, you are starving , poor little chiclet ,\"ncrooned Mama, mincing forward with the tray. \"You see, I makenspecial treat for you. I hope you like spicy food.\" She winkednmeaningfully up at the Prince. \"Mrs. Toad,\" he tried again, pointing over the prow. \"Oh, don't worry,\" Mama went on, taking Cor's attemptnto get her attention as a negative reply, \"I make it mild, younno – \" The boat jolted suddenly as it rammed into a felled tree branchnspanning the stream; with a surprised lurch Mama sent the entire traynof breakfast spraying all over Mozo and Gringo. \" Ay , whatnhappen?\" she cried, spinning to survey the branch for a moment.n\" Muchachos ,\" she stamped her foot again, turningnback round and glaring down at Mozo and Gringo, who where stillnpressed onto the deck under Grundel's weight, \"what were younthinking?\" \"But Grun – \" Mozo started to protest; but Gringonsilenced him with a punch to the head. Mama hesitated for a moment, then spun on her heel and flouncednback to the tent. \"Well go on, go on – get it out of the way,\"nshe said sharply, and disappeared inside once again. Cor landed on the railing as Grundel stood up, stared after hisndeparting mother for a moment, and moved away to the other side ofnthe boat. Mozo and Gringo, wiping food out of their eyes, leapt intonthe water and swam in opposite directions along the branch. \"Well?\" prompted Cor when they'd swum back, a fewnminutes later. \"We can clear it,\" replied Gringo. Cornelius breathednout in relief. \"But it take two days. Maybe more,\" added Mozo. Cor slumped and touched his forehead. \"Oh no,\" henmuttered. \"All right,\" he said at length, \"well, maybenbetween the four of us...\" He frowned and looked around. \"What'snwith that Grundel?\" he complained. \"He keeps wanderingnoff.\" \"Mud poisoning,\" suggested Gringo, and the two brothersnburst into teasing laughter once again. Cornelius had had enough. \"That's it; I can't take any morenof this crazy family. I'm leaving.\" And he flew to the bank andnpushed though the reeds, trying to put as much distance betweennhimself and the showboat as possible, as quickly as he could. \"Toads,\" he mumbled in disgust, as Mozo's and Gringo'snlaughter finally died away behind him.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four It was an ambush! Thumbelina spun nimbly in midair and jabbed. A direct hit! Shenzoomed in a tight arc towards the ground, her rapier flashing, as shendove towards a group of her attackers. Jab, slash, parry, thrust! Hernwings showered silver sparks as the Princess zipped to and fro,nbattling the enemy in a wild blur. At last, victory! Thumbelina lit on the ground and surveyed thenbattlefield, panting. \"That's for taking my people,\" shensaid regally, through gritted teeth. And then she turned around. She stood before her mother's full-length mirror. The daydreamnfaded: the Kobold cavern around her turned back into her mother'snbedroom, the glinting rapier in her hand back into a bluntedndarning-needle, her silver armor back into a fine lavender gown.nThumbelina felt a little foolish, but also somewhat affronted. Fairynwomen were not permitted to train for combat, and Cornelius hadnadamantly refused to even let her hold his sword despite her greatninterest. It simply wasn't done. But how she desired to fight to get her people back, to stand atnCornelius' side when he reached the Mountain! \"'Allo, 'allo, Thumbelina!\" Thumbelina spied Jacquimo in the mirror, fluttering to land behindnher. She turned, dropping the needle. \"You're back!\" shenexclaimed, clasping her hands together. \"So soon! Oh, Jacquimo –ntell me you've found it!\" The swallow held up his wings to ward off any more questions. \"Indo just as well,\" he replied. \"I find somebody who knowsnwhere it is. Come, he is waiting.\" And he flew up to land on thenwindowsill. Thumbelina followed him immediately. \"There's no one here.\" The Princess was deeplyndisappointed. \"Well I'll be blowed! It really is a little Fairy! I nevernwould have thought!\" Thumbelina startled at the voice, which came from directlynoverhead. She looked up to see a brown bat hanging by his feet at thentop of the window jamb, gazing down at her in fascination. \"I'll have to record this,\" the bat went on, clearlynexcited; he reached around to remove a quill and a book of sorts fromnhis vest. \"'Specimen,'\" he mumbled, writing in the book,n\"'Light Fey, Flower Fairy, female, five - no, five and a halfncentimeters, sighted nine forty-two am, twenty-second of June.' Gotnit.\" He put the book and quill away and flapped on down to thensill. Thumbelina looked at him with polite interest. The bat was about a head taller than Jacquimo, with huge concavenears and a flat snout with pointed nostrils. He wore a misbuttonednyellow plaid vest and patched green trousers; these in conjunctionnwith the book he'd been writing in gave him an \"absent-mindednprofessor\" sort of air. His sleepy eyes were, at least when henwas not hanging upside-down, all but obscured by a wild shock ofnshaggy fur. This and his overall rumpled appearance reassurednThumbelina, who normally might be afraid of such a creature. Shensmiled. \"Thumbelina,\" said Jacquimo after the bat had landed,n\"this is Cecil. He assures me he knows where the Kobolds live.\" \"Your Highness,\" said Cecil politely, bowing. The booknhe had stuffed down the front of his vest suddenly slid forward andnbonked him on the chin, forcing him to straighten quickly and rub thensore spot with one wing. \"Er – charmed,\" he said quickly,nsmiling apologetically. \"It's just Thumbelina,\" she corrected him, preferringnthat non-Fairies just call her by her name. \"Are you sure younknow where the Kobolds are?\" Thumbelina said urgently. \"Oh, yes,\" the bat assured her. \"I was a professornof Mythological Studies in London for a spell – before I gotnsacked, you know.\" \"Sacked?\" \"Well, most folks just don't believe in mythologicalncreatures,\" Cecil said with a shrug. \"It was either me ornthe bloke what taught Girl's Badminton what got the sack, so they hadnto make a decision. The same old sad story, yeah? But no worries, I'mnon extended holiday now; I'm touring Europe, recording magicalnsightings.\" \"Er...have you got many so far?\" asked Thumbelina out ofnpoliteness. Cecil nodded, pleased. \"A fair few,\" he told her. \"AndnI seen them Kobolds of yours, round a Mountain east of here, by thenriver. That's why when this bird – \" he indicated Jacquimonwith a jab of his thumb – \"started squawking up a storm aboutnKobolds in the cave I was trying to sleep in last night I thought I'dnhave a go.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Thumbelina told the bat.n\"It's extremely helpful. Will you tell Jacquimo where it is sonhe can fly me there? We must leave right away.\" At this Jacquimo coughed gently, and Thumbelina winced. \"Oh, Jacquimo, I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking,\" she said.n\"Of course, we'll wait until you've rested.\" Cecil looked back and forth between the two with uncertainty.n\"It's an emergency, is it?\" he asked. \"If the birdnneeds to rest, I could flap you on down there myself.\" Thumbelina smiled dazzlingly at the bat. \"Oh, could you?\" she gasped. \"It's just that I'm so worried...\" \"It is a good idea,\" Jacquimo spoke up. \"A bat cannfly in the dark, even better than I.\" \"That's right,\" nodded Cecil. \"Give the oldnecholocation system a kick in the trousers. No trouble at all.\" \"And after I rest, I will follow you,\" said Jacquimo.n\"Perhaps I catch you up.\" Thumbelina threw her arms around the swallow's neck. \"Thanknyou, Jacquimo,\" she said. \"You are a dear friend.\" The bird gave a modest bow. \"Anything for the Fairies,\"nhe said. \"Take care of her, my friend,\" he told the batnwith an amiable wink; and then he flew off towards the distant trees. \"Do you need to pack?\" Cecil asked Thumbelina. \"No, but I have to say good-bye to my mother. Wait for me –nI won't be a minute.\" o o o o o o o o o o o o o o Cornelius picked his way along the streambank, occasionallynswiping irritably at an offending blade of grass with his sword. Thenstream flowed east and he followed it for want of any other course ofnaction. The toads' showboat now lay far behind him; apparently no onenwas following him. For which he was glad – he couldn't get annimage of Mama Toad leaping amorously out of the grass at him out ofnhis mind. Once again he cursed the stork for damaging his wing. It wouldnheal, yes; but it would be days before he could fly without worry ofncausing a permanent injury, and how much longer would his people lastnin the heart of the Mountain? Worse...what if they weren't innthe Mountain? What if the Kobolds had taken them somewhere else –nhow would he ever find out? And who could he ask that would know thenbusiness of Fey? Another member of the Fey, certainly, but he knew ofnno other Faerie-Kin within any sort of reasonable distance from hisnown Kingdom. Then again, he mused, he had already strayed farthernfrom the Vale than ever before. Suddenly he heard a bumblebee droning nearby, and paused. If onlynthat were Buzzby, Cor thought dismally. The bee droned again, andnCornelius found himself wandering towards the noise wistfully. Ifnonly...He swept aside a sheaf of grass, and blinked. A large, handsome bumblebee was struggling in a massive spiderwebnstretched between a couple of cattails beside the stream. It lookednso much like Buzzby! Was it possible? \"Buzzby!\" called Cornelius, uncertain, moving a fewnpaces closer. The bee stopped wriggling for a moment to regard himnwith his shiny black eyes. His drone turned into a high-pitched whinenand he wiggled his antennae alternately up and down. Cor was ecstatic. \"Good boy!\" he shouted, flying forwardnand starting to hack at the web with his sword. \"You found me!nYou took Thumbelina home, didn't you?\" Buzzby dropped to thenground, free but his wings glued together with sticky webbing. Henbegan turning in circles, trying to clean it off with his forelimbs.nCornelius laughed. \"Come here, let me help you.\" But at that moment the owner of the web, a great orb weavernspider, appeared in the grass. It scuttled forward so suddenlyntowards the cattails that Cor was startled backward into thenremainder of the web, his wings and back sticking fast. \"No!\" he gasped, trying to swing his sword but unable tonmove his arm. \"Get back!\" Buzzby reared forward but the big spider was quicker, racing upnthe cattail and heading for its meal. Cor stared with horrifiednfascination as the fangs jabbed forward to paralyze him. Suddenly something snared him by one ankle and he was yanked outnof the web by a long pink sticky tongue. And then Grundel was holdingnhim by the front of his tunic and glowering down at him. \"Younleave me behind,\" the toad reprimanded. \"Spider! Spider!\" squeaked Cor, pointing madly at thenorb weaver which was now scuttling towards the toad. Grundel frowned at the interruption; he held Cornelius off to onenside while he snarled at the spider, stomping the ground before itnwith one foot. The spider stopped short, took one look at thenmenacing amphibian, and took off like a shot into the grass. Buzzby rushed towards Grundel, humming angrily. The toad plantednhis foot on the bumblebee's head and held him at bay as he turned hisnattention back on the shaken Prince. \"You leave me behind,\" he repeated. Cor swallowed. \"Please put me down,\" he said. To his surprise, Grundel did at once, and Buzzby backed away,nshaking his head indignantly. \"You saved my life.\" But the toad just looked at Cor. \"Why you leave me behind?\"nhe asked, his tone changing. Cornelius hesitated. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"But...\" \"What?\" How on Earth to put this? \"I...It's just...Well...Wellnfrankly, it's your temper,\" Cor managed at last. Grundel dropped his gaze. \"I no temper,\" he protestednweakly. \"I go with you, help the Fairies.\" But Cornelius shook his head – the toad's violent mood swingsnwere just too volatile. \"No,\" he said, turning to helpnBuzzby pull the webbing off of his wings. \"You've done more thannenough, saving my life just now. Why don't we call it even.\" At last the bee's wings were clear and Cornelius jumped gratefullynon his back; Buzzby, thrilled, revved up his wings and waited for hisnmaster's signal to take off. \"Go back home,\" Cor shoutednover the drone. For a couple of seconds Grundel stood there, looking a bit hurt.n\"I no home,\" he said shortly, and, turning, startednwalking, not downstream in the direction of the showboat, but backntowards the trees. Towards the clearing Cornelius had first found himnin. Cornelius started to lean forward but before he gripped Buzzby'snantennae – the signal to take off – he froze as the toad's wordsnand actions struck him as strange. \"Wait, Buzz,\" he said,nand the bee stopped his wings and drooped, disappointed. Cornelius thought about how Grundel's appearance on the boat thisnmorning had caused a sensation, not to mention how Mrs. Toad not onlyndidn't greet her son but also never even seemed to look at him. Andnthey definitely never said one word to each other... \"Grundel! Grundel, wait!\" Cor had dismounted and was nownhurrying after the retreating toad. \"Wait.\" He caught up tonGrundel, who stopped walking but did not look at him. \"What donyou mean...You mean you don't have a home?\" \"When I no bring Thumbelina back,\" said the toad slowly,nstill not turning around, \"Mama angry. She say many bad thing. Inget angry too, leave show. Mama say, show is family; if I leave shownI leave family. Now I no home.\" \"I didn't know. I'm sorry.\" Cor passed a hand over hisnface. \"I shouldn't have left you behind,\" he said, \"andnI promise to never do it again.\" Grundel turned round then, and gave him a baleful look. Cornelius shrugged and smiled wanly. \"Well, are we going tonstand here like a couple of weeds in a swamp or are we going to gonfind the Fairies?\" He started back towards Buzzby, keeping eyencontact over his shoulder with the toad, who hesitated, then followednhim. \"All right, boy,\" said Cor, kneeling before Buzzby andnstroking his head. \"This is Grundel. Don't sting him.\" Henstood up and looked at the toad. \"This is Buzzby. Don't eatnhim.\" Buzzby and Grundel eyed each other warily. \"Can you keep up with a bumblebee?\" asked Cornelius,nswinging a leg over Buzzby's back. \"I keep up. We follow stream?\" \"Yes. Though I'm sure it twists and bends, all streamsndo...I'd rather go as the crow flies.\" \"Big bend in stream, that way,\" said Grundel promptly,npointing south. \"Stream go left.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"Saw kingfisher drop.\" Cor exhaled. \"Boy am I glad to have you back,\" he said.n\"Right, then, we'll cut across the reeds and rejoin the streamnlater; it'll save time. Let's go, Buzz!\" he commanded, and wasnrelieved to once again feel the rush of air as his faithful bee borenhim off into the sky. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o Berkeley Beetle was having yet another bad night. \"Throw me out...no sense of style...I'll show themnup...they'll regret this for a million years...\" Having lost hisncrew of yes men weeks ago when they refused to work for no money, henhad picked up the habit of talking to himself. \"Berkeley Beetlenwill shine again in the entertainment industry, mark my words!\"nhe shouted, one fist raised, as he glared into the distance at thenlast night club he had tried in vain to get to hire him as stagendirector. \"I didn't want to work for you yahoos anyway!\"nhe went on vehemently, scowling furiously. \"Why would a bug of my expertise, my talent, my reputation want tonwork for a bunch of SLUGS?? Slime and silk don't mix, pal!\"nHe turned again and stalked off across the field, arms crossedntightly against his sides. \"Slugs,\" he mumbled. Berkeley's life had been going steadily downhill ever since lastnwinter, when a bad-tempered toad had taken his wings and, despite thenfulfillment of a bargain, never gave them back. In fact, the toadnhimself seemed to have disappeared off of the map, as Berkeley hadnspent a fortune on private investigators who searched without lucknall spring for a Spanish toad named Grundel. Berkeley became sonobsessed with getting his wings back that he lost his job at thenBeetle Ballroom, which resulted in losing his apartment and having tonsell off all his possessions, and finally, as mentioned, losing hisnemployees as he went flat broke. He was looking rather shabby thesendays. \"Stupid toad,\" he grumbled, falling into a well-wornngroove. \"What did he have to take my wings for? Any normal thugnwould have taken my wallet. Who takes someone's wings, that's justnbarbaric. It's all that ugly girl's fault,\" he switched tactics.n\"None of it would have happened if it weren't for her. I wish Inhad never heard her stupid screechy voice in the first place - Hey,nthat's it!\" he exclaimed, stopping short and listening. Sure enough, as he pushed forward through the weeds, it becamenclearer: Thumbelina's voice, trilling a song. Berkeley crept alongnlike a weasel so he could see her. He nearly screamed in indignationnwhen he did. \" She's got wings, she's got wings! \" hensqueaked, chewing on the fingers of one hand. \"How did that little midge get wings when I – \" And then he rememberednsomething. Yesterday he had been scrounging half-empties at a seedy bug barnwhen he overheard a grunting conversation between two thugs swillingnthistlebeer in a dark corner. Apparently a reward had been posted fornanyone who had spotted Prince Cornelius or Princess Thumbelina of thenFlower Fairies, whom were both missing. Or at least, someone wasnsearching for them. Berkeley trembled in the grass, pulling unconsciously on hisnragged handlebar moustache, which had seen much better days. Anreward! He had even overheard where news was to be taken in order tonclaim... the reward . The beetle beamed and rubbed his handsntogether. \"Hot-cha!\" he cackled. \"I knew you'd pay offneventually, toots!\" But without his wings, he knew, he couldnhardly just swagger up and grab the girl. No, he'd have to watch, andnlisten, for opportunity to knock...[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Thumbelina sang softly as she gathered a few edible roots andnflower petals. She was on her way to meet Cornelius! All morning theynhad flown, and it was now early afternoon. Cecil flew very fast –nnot so fast as Jacquimo at top speed, but Thumbelina was more thannsatisfied that they would make good time. Neither had gotten muchnsleep the night before, and they had paused to catch a few hours ofnrest - at this moment Cecil was hanging in a nearby tree snoring –nbut Thumbelina had woken first and, hungry, fluttered to the groundnto find something to eat. Thumbelina sat on a rock and ate a flower petal. She wished therenwas some way to train with a weapon before reaching the Mountain; shenwasn't sure she'd be much use otherwise if Cornelius needed warriors.nAnd she did want to be useful! She tried to think of what else shencould do that would turn the tide against the Kobolds. \"There you are.\" Cecil landed heavily beside Thumbelina.n\"Hope you haven't had to wait for me very long, I was wellnknackered.\" Thumbelina shook her head. \"No, I was just sitting herenthinking...\" \"What about?\" The Princess had filled the bat in on the plight of the Fairies asnthey had flown. \"I was just thinking that I wish I could bringnCornelius an army to help fight the Kobolds,\" she said as thenidea struck her that very moment. \"But I don't know if very manynanimals would be willing to fight Faerie-Kin.\" Cecil nodded. \"Right you are – most don't even believe innthem. They'd think you were a nutter, even if they got a right looknat you. Claim your wings were strapped on, like, they would. Inremember this hare, back at university, what had glued a brassntrumpet to his forehead and went about insisting he was a unicorn.nDidn't help my reputation any.\" The bat frowned. \"'Seenany Rabbitcorns lately?' they'd say to me in the cafeteria – \" \"If only humans would help!\" interrupted Thumbelinanbefore the topic was lost forever. \"Oh, nah, nah,\" disagreed Cecil quickly. \"A lot ofnhumans stumbling about looking for Fey! They cause enough damage bynaccident without us telling them where to do it. No,\" he went onnthoughtfully. \"What we need is some more Fey.\" \"But I don't know where any are.\" \"Hold on a tic.\" Cecil retrieved his field journal fromnhis vest and flipped through it. \"I remember passing throughnthis area just a few days back and spotting something but I make sonmany inconclusive notes...Here's the entry, yes...Yes, it seems Incaught a suspicious flash of blue light moving about in a pool, don'tnthink it's too far from here. I wrote down, 'possible Nixiensighting'.\" Nixies. King Colbert had told Thumbelina that they were waternsprites, similar to Fairies in appearance but warlike and savage. \"But Nixies are of the Neutral Fey,\" mused Thumbelinanaloud. \"They don't care for Fairies.\" \"Well they're a sight better than Dark Fey, aren't they?\"nasked Cecil, putting the book away. \"They're supposed to benfighters. They'd make quite an army.\" They would. Thumbelina could see herself now, leading an army ofnNixie warriors to the Mountain and surprising Cornelius, who'd looknat her with admiration and awe. \"It's a good idea,\" shentold the bat with finality. \"Is the pool much out of the way?\" \"Nah, it's just a skip.\" \"Then let's go.\" o o o o o o o o o o o o o o \"Mud. I hate mud.\" \"I sympathize, but at least you won't smother if you getnswallowed up. It must be handy to be able to breathe through yournskin underwater...Come on, boy!\" shouted Cor impatiently overnhis shoulder. Buzzby hadn't been able to fly far. Flying all morning and much ofnthe previous night had sapped most of his strength; and now both henand Cor were grounded, leaving them to struggle to keep up afternGrundel, who was coping with the thick bog they'd blundered into muchnbetter than either the Fairy or his steed. To make things worse, itnhad gotten dark very quickly. Grundel grit his teeth. \"I rather smother,\" he grumbled.n\" You try be buried in cold muck for three month, see how you like.\" Struggling to traverse the putrid swamp had worn Cornelius' nervesnrather thin, and he was in no mood to start a pointless argument withnthe touchy toad. \"Look, I'm sorry about that,\" he snapped,n\"but you asked for it!\" \"I no ask be thrown off bridge into – \" \" I didn't throw you! \" Cor retorted hotly. \"Younwere after Thumbelina! You tried to kill me, too, you know!\" Grundel seethed. \"I was trying save Thumbelina from you! \"nhe growled. \"I wanted marry her!\" \"Yeah well, she didn't want to marry you! She wantednto marry me! \" It was the wrong thing to say. Cornelius managed to dodge just inntime as the big toad made a swipe at him. \"Knock it off!\" yelled Cor. \"I warned you aboutnyour temper!\" \" I no temper! \" howled Grundel, swinging again andnthis time sending Cornelius sprawling in the mire. \"Stand down, Toad!\" shouted Cornelius, grabbing for hisnsword, but he wouldn't need it. Buzzby, indignant that someone wouldndare strike his master, leapt upon Grundel as the toad prepared tonkick at the Fairy. \" Abeja asquerosa ,\" roared the toad, reachingnaround to yank Buzzby off his back. \"I crush you like –nAAAIIIIIEEEEEAAAHHHH!\" Grundel screamed as the bumblebee stungnhim on the leg. Cornelius picked himself up and morosely swiped muck from his facenwith his forearm. \"That's what you get for acting like a fool,\"nhe said angrily. Buzzby dropped to the ground as Grundel hopped about in agony. \"Hensting me, he sting me!\" he was shrieking, both hands pressed tona spot on his left thigh. \"Is dolor tremendo! I die now, aeeeiah! Killed by Fairy Prince in stinking swamp!\" \"Oh knock it off, you won't die.\" Cornelius went toncheck that Buzzby hadn't been hurt in the scuffle. \"If Buzz hadnbeen trying to sting you to death, you'd be dead bynnow.\" Grundel stopped hopping and scowled at the Fairy. \"Younno-good insecto ,\" he glowered. \"Is your faultnwe stuck in this bog asqueroso .\" He staggered forward andngrabbed Cor by his much-abused tunic and held him off of the ground.n\"Now I no hop, you no fly – better that bee had kill men'cause now we die here anyway!\" Cor, dangling, threw his hands in the air. \"Well that's justngreat,\" he sputtered. \"My people get kidnapped and the onlynperson I can find to help me is a fatalistic toad. That's it, I'mnmaking a Royal Decree: Henceforth, no member of the Royal Family willnkeep company with a toad if he wants to retain his san – Hey!\"nhe exclaimed suddenly, \"Look over there!\" Grundel didn't look. \"I no fall for trick,\" hensnarled, pulling Cor closer. \"I too busy squeeze you intonbugbutter to – \" Then he looked anyway as he caught a flash ofnlight out of the corner of his eye. \"Eh? Is light!\" \"Yes, is light!\" parroted Cornelius, and he wiggled freenas the toad loosed his grasp. \"There's someone over there! We'rennot alone in this swamp! Come on! Come on, boy!\" he encouragednboth his companion and his mount, his most recent brush with deathntaking a backseat to the possibility of getting out of the dismalnbog. He started towards the distant, bobbing yellow light at the bestnapproximation of a jog he could muster over the mushy ground. Henglanced over his shoulder and saw the toad limping wordlessly afternhim, and Buzzby floundering along behind. \"Come on, keep up! We're getting closer!\" At last,nthought Cornelius. I can't stand this marsh much longer! \"Perhapsnthey'll take us to their house, and give us something to eat!\"nCor went on breathlessly, suddenly regretting how breakfast had beennspilled all over Mozo and Gringo. \"I'm famished!\" Grundel replied by snapping up a big horsefly and spitting out anwing. \"...And now I'm not,\" winced Cor. \"Funny how thatnworks.\" \"Light move away,\" Grundel pointed out, nodding at it. \"No it isn't,\" Cornelius denied quickly, not wantingnit to be true. But, unfortunately, the toad was right: the light,nwhich had gotten enticingly closer, was now bobbing away from them.n\"Hey!\" shouted Cor urgently. \"Come back! Wait! We needn– We need to get out of this swamp! Please help us!\" Suddenly Cornelius slipped on a particularly slimy patch of mucknand fell flat on his face, spread-eagle in the mud. He pushed himselfnup gingerly as Grundel, panting and wheezing, drew up alongside him. \"I finish,\" gasped the toad, bent over, his left handnclamped over the spot where Buzzby had stung him. \"Is bee poisonnme. I no more run.\" Cor suddenly realized that this was no mere whining; Buzz had beennknown to knock out a snake with a non-lethal sting. \"You can'tnquit now,\" he urged, putting the toad's right arm about hisnshoulders and trying to support him. It was quite like trying to keepna steel brick from toppling over. \"Just a little bit farther.\" Grundel jogged a few paces obligingly before stopping again. \"Isnno good,\" he winced, and he fell forward. Cor, under the toad'snarm, also fell, and they both lay sprawled on their stomachs side bynside in the mud. Behind them, Buzz sank down, exhausted. Cor kept his head down; he felt so defeated. For his quest to endnhere, this way...He squinted as a bright light suddenly illuminatednthe whole area. \"Well well well!\" Cor and Grundel looked up wearily. Before them, hovering aboutntwice Grundel's full standing height above the ground, was a verynstrange Fairy-like being. He was extremely skinny, with pure-whitenskin, and wore a suit made up of so many garish colors that it wasnalmost offensive. He had long white hair that was arranged to standnup in peaks, making him appear as if he had very recently been strucknby lightning. His wide blue-violet eyes glinted with cockiness andnthe edges of his thin mouth curled up in a devilish grin. But most remarkable were his long, pointed wings, which wereninexplicably pulsing with a strong, bright light, bathing the gapingnFairy and toad in yellow. \"What that? \" gasped Grundel, transfixed. Cor swallowed. \"It's a Will o'Wisp,\" he said in dismay.n\"A Dark Fey.\" \"What dark?\" Grundel started to argue; but then the Willno'Wisp began an odd, victorious sort of mid-air dance. \"I did it, I got you!\" he crowed in a tinkling, singsongnvoice as he sashayed back and forth delightedly. \"Once more Inled foolish weary travelers to their doom! Wink, baby, you are a gem! \" he congratulated himself, looping-the-loop gaily.n\"Now then,\" he said to no one in particular, \"let'snsee what we got.\" He zipped to hover above Buzzby, who hummedndangerously and shrank away from the softly throbbing light of thenFey's wings. \"Oooh, a wee pesky bumblebee, uh-huh, uh-huh, verynnice! Pat on the back!\" he smirked, actually reaching around tongive himself a pat between the shoulder blades. \"What else, whatnelse...\" Grundel gawked up at the floating Fey with huge eyes as Winknappraised his next victim. \"Hmmm, hmmm,\" mused thenFaerie-Kin, stroking his chin and bobbing up and down. \"A lamentoad. Fat, too. Well, you can't win them all, I suppose...\" \"You can stop gloating now, you vile thing!\" voiced Cornwith all the determination he could muster. He shoved Grundel's armnoff of him and tried to rise, but he was too mired to get evennhalfway off of the ground. \"Oooh!\" squealed Wink in rapture, hovering backwards anbit to get a better look, his hands plastered to either side of hisnlong, mocking face. \"An icky, ickle Fairy! Why, that's anhundred points, ha ha!\" He spread his arms wide and shot up intonthe air several feet, spinning so that his wings, now a bright pink,nleft spiraling trails like a double helix. The Fey floated slowlynback down, his wings pulsing red. He jabbed a finger at Cornelius,nhis eyes now a bright green. \"You Fairies think you're so smart,\" he hissed,nhis tone suddenly venomous. \"But you'll have your day yet, everynlast one of your prissy, simpering kind!\" A second later,nthough, he had gone back to yellow wings, purple eyes, and an impishngrin. \"And I caught one, I did, I did!\" He bounced, hyper,nup and down in the air with glee. \"Yes, you and your ugly friendnare mine, mine, mine! Losers, losers, ahahahaaa!\" Wink turned his back on the Fairy and the toad, and the light innhis wings abruptly switched off, the sudden darkness blinding to eyesnthat had gotten accustomed to bright illumination. A second laternletters appeared in orange on the transparent wings, one afternanother: L – O – S on the back of the left wing and E – R – Snon the right. They winked out, then lit back up again in purple; andnthey continued to flash in alternate colors while Wink cackledninsanely. Cornelius and Grundel gaped, dumbfounded. \"Prince Cornelius of the Stinky Flower Fairies, that's who henmust be!\" the Will o'Wisp babbled to himself delightedly. \"Oh,nthe Kobolds'll get a kick out of this! They'll – HEY!!!\" Grundel stood up painfully, disengaging his tongue from Wink'snankle as he gripped him by the throat. \"What Kobold?\" henroared. Cor was on his feet in an instant. \"Where are my people?\" cried the Prince, drawing hisnsword and putting its point to the Fey's left temple. The Will o'Wisp blinked back and forth between his two attackers;nthen he opened his wide mouth and screamed. \"Knock it off!\" yelled Cor, and the Will o'Wisp shut hisnmouth with a snap. Grundel shook Wink, making the Fey's wings, now a sickly green,nrattle. \"Where Kobold Mountain?\" the toad demanded. \"Yountell us!\" \"Aaaugh! Aaaugh! Aaauuughhh! Stop, stop it!\" Winknscreeched. \"Can't you control your pet?\" he pleaded withnCor, who had decided his sword was unneeded and had put it away. Cornelius shrugged. \"Nah,\" he said casually. \"AndnI've frankly given up trying. Now,\" the Prince leaned forwardnand narrowed his eyes dangerously, \"where have the Kobolds takennthe Fairies?\" When Wink didn't respond immediately, Grundel started shakingnhim again. \"I dunno, I dunno, I dunno! \" screamed Wink, hisnvibrant eyes bulging. \"Oh well,\" said Cornelius in mock boredom, looking up atnthe toad. \"I guess you'll have to eat him.\" Wink's lower lip trembled. \"That's not fair , it isn't,nit isn't,\" he whined piteously. \"He won't tell menwhere the Kobolds are.\" \"Who won't?\" said Cor sharply. \"My brother .\" The Will o'Wisp blinked back tears.n\"He says I'd tell . I'd never tell anyone, never –nExceptyouguys!\" he squeaked hastily as Grundel squeezed him. Cornelius gripped Wink's shoulder and leaned close to thenquivering, pale face. \"Take us to your brother, then. Now. Or Inlet the toad eat you.\" Grundel licked his great lips hungrily, and Cor didn't doubtnthat he would eat the miserable Fey if he got the chance. After he'd quit wailing, Wink directed Cor and Grundel through thenbog to a small shack built almost invisibly against the side of anrotted tree stump. Buzzby managed to drag himself behind the group.nThe Fairy and toad were just as spent but this new development hadngiven them both a burst of renewed strength. \"Cobalt! Cobalt!\" shouted Wink as the trio entered (thenbee choosing to remain outside the shack, which had become suddenlynrather cramped). \"Don't kill me! They made me do it!\" The Will o'Wisp called Cobalt, who was shorter, stouter, andnbalder than his brother, jumped up from his armchair and dropped thenscrap of paper he was reading. \"Great flashing fireflies,nPeriwinkle!\" he gasped in a rather squeaky voice. \"Whatnhave you gotten yourself into this time?\" \"You will tell us where the Kobolds have taken the FlowernFairies!\" cried Cor, pressing Cobalt against a wall with hisnsword. \"Or I will extinguish your foul light for good!\" Cobalt gaped, horrified, at his assailant; then he glared over thensword at Wink, who still dangled from Grundel's right fist. \"Wink,nyou dimbulb!\" he chided. \"You got too close to your victimsnagain! What am I always telling you?\" \"But...But...\" protested Wink feebly.n\"They...Coby...Gack,\" he concluded as Grundel tightened hisngrip. \" Tell me ,\" raged Cor impatiently. \"The Mountain of the Kobolds lies to the east!\" blurtednCobalt in terror. \"The stream meets the river and the river willntake you there!\" Cornelius stepped back, mollified. They had been following thenright path, then. \"And the Fairies are there?\" he furtherninterrogated the Will o'Wisp, his sword still raised. \"Yes,\" Cobalt replied reluctantly, his brilliant blueneyes narrowing. \"The Kobolds have taken them to the Mountain.nAlong with many other Light Fey.\" \"More Fairies?\" asked Grundel. \"No,\" Cor told the toad grimly over his shoulder. \"Henmeans other Faerie-Folk.\" \"Yes,\" repeated Cobalt, his eyes flashing green as hisnfear began to fade. \"I hear they've gotten some Sprites andnPixies, and a few Brownies as well. They'll see to it that younmiserable spreaders of sweetness and light get what's coming to you –nEeepdon'tkillme!\" he squeaked as Cornelius poked him angrilynin the chest with his sword. \"You wretched coward,\" snarled Cor, restraining himselfnfrom slaying the evil Fey on the spot. \"Taking delight innleading innocent people to their doom isn't good enough for you, isnit? You have to crow over the deaths of hundreds of good Fairies andntheir ilk! Now,\" he went on, remembering something, \"how isnit that your sniveling brother knew who I was?\" Cobalt shot an angry look at Wink, who could only whine. \"There'sna bounty on your head,\" the shorter Will o'Wisp answerednreluctantly. \"Yours and Princess Thumbelina's.\" Cornstiffened at the name. \"I took it upon myself to offer a rewardnfor information concerning your whereabouts. If we could deliver onenor both of you to the Kobolds ourselves, we Will o'Wisps might get tonshare in the destruction of your kind.\" He hesitated. \"Wenweren't invited, you see,\" he added in an undertone. \"Well?\" prompted Cornelius, his voice shaking. \"Havenyou heard anything? About Thumbelina?\" He was answered byndefiant silence. \" Well?? \" he repeated, jabbingnCobalt again just as Grundel squeezed Wink's throat. \"No! No!\" cried the brothers in miserable chorus. \"Wendon't know where Princess Thumbelina is!\" At that moment the door burst open behind them. \"I know wherenPrincess Thumbelina is!\" Berkeley crowed, then stood rooted tonthe spot, gaping at Grundel, who looked equally surprised. \"Sorry, wrong house,\" quipped the beetle, turning tonbolt; but it was too late. He was swiftly transported to Grundel'snleft hand via the toad's tongue and found himself face-to-face withnWink, who stared at him wide-eyed. But Berkeley's eyes were screwed tightly shut. \"Augh! Augh!\"nhe screamed, kicking. \"Let me go! Haven't you abused menenough??\" \"Where is Thumbelina?\" growled Grundel, shaking Berkeleynwhile Wink put on a smug look, gratified that he wasn't the brunt ofnthe toad's anger any more. \"Thumbelina? Thumbelina who? Aaaaaauuughhh all right allnright all right! \" The beetle whimpered and finally openednhis eyes. He blinked at Wink, who smiled and waved at him. \"You!\" cried Berkeley, his eyes shooting daggers. \"Younmust be a Will o'Wisp! This is all your fault!! This was all anset-up! You lying little moth-magnet!\" And he reached out andnstarted throttling Wink with a ferocity even Grundel had not yetnshown. This was out of the realm of Grundel's expertise. He lookednplaintively to Cornelius for help. He needn't have worried; Cor wasn't having any. \"All right,nthat's enough!\" He slid the point of his sword under Berkeley'snchin and pressed until the beetle released Wink and both stared atnhim in fright. \"That's better,\" hissed the Fairy. \"Now.nWhere did you see Thumbelina? If you do not tell me, it won't be him you'll need to worry about.\" He jerked his headntowards Grundel. Berkeley swallowed with difficulty. \"I saw her in a field.\" \" Which field?\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"Why not? \" Berkeley gave an exasperated sigh. \"Because she left .\" Cor gritted his teeth. \"If you don't know where she is now ,\" he spat, \"what good did you think yourninformation would be to these creatures?\" Irritated once again, this time at Fey in general, Berkeley foldednhis arms tightly and glared at a wall. Cobalt made a disgusted noise and Cornelius whirled on him. \"Didnyou have anything to say?\" he demanded. \"Yeah. You're a terrible interrogator.\" Cobalt rollednhis blue eyes. \"Oh sure, you're all scary with your sword andnyour domesticated frog over there, but you don't know whatnquestions to ask! It's pathetic!\" Cornelius started to feel very out of control of the situation.n\"Well, I...\" he faltered, glancing to Grundel, who justnblinked back at him. \"What should I ask?\" \"You have to be more specific ,\" answered Cobaltnin a superior \"I-know-more-than-you\" tone. \"Leave nonroom for misleading answers.\" He shrugged. \"Of course, Inwouldn't expect a member of the Light Fey to be much good at thisnsort of thing. You're just not crafty enough, are you? Too busyngranting wishes and dancing around mushrooms to – \" He fellnsilent at Cornelius' murderous glare. After a brief pause, Cor turned back to the beetle, who wasnwatching him carefully. \"A specific question,\" he murmurednsoftly. He couldn't think straight between thoughts of findingnThumbelina soon and being both hungry and exhausted. \"Oooh, oooh, I got one!\" volunteered Wink cheerfully,nwaving one hand in the air with gusto. \"How about, 'Where isnThumbelina now'? \" \"Good one, little bro!\" nodded Cobalt. \"That'snthinking with your head. For once.\" \"They are a lot better at this than you,\"nBerkeley had to point out. Cor sighed. \"Just answer the question.\" Berkeley drew himself up as best he could. \"They went to thenPool of the Nixies.\" \"Nixies!\" gasped Cor in surprise. \"There's Nixies –n\" Then he caught himself. \"What do you mean 'they'? Whonelse was with her?\" Berkeley tugged at his moustache. \"A bat,\" he replied.n\"A great big, ugly, hairy bat. Don't worry pal,\" henlooked up at Grundel, \"he wasn't half as ugly as you.\" Wink burst out in squeaky laughter. Grundel bonked the beetle andnWill o'Wisp's heads together in reply. While Berkeley was still reeling, Cornelius grabbed him by hisnshabby lapels. \"Where is the Pool of the Nixies?\" he askednhim. \"How should I know?\" glowered Berkeley, rubbing hisnhead. \"I don't even know what a Nixie is.\" In an instant Cornelius was upon Cobalt, pinning him to the wallnagain with his sword. \"But you: you, I am certain, know what anNixie is, don't you? You are going to take us to their Pool. Now.nOr both you and your brother are going to make a couple of hungrynmarsh hawks very happy. Is that specific enough for you?\" Cobalt indicated, by incoherent squeakings, that it was. \"Hey!\" shouted Berkeley indignantly as Grundel releasednhim and shoved him towards the open door. \"Where's my reward? Inwas supposed to get a reward for bringing information here, and I'mnnot leaving until I get one!\" He bent his wrists on his hips andnscowled around the room. \"I give no-good lying beetle reward,\" said Grundelngruffly. And in an instant he had removed Wink's wings and pressednthem into Berkeley's hands. \"HEY!\" Wink shouted; but it was too late. \"JACKPOT!!\" Berkeley swung the wings around and fastenednthem onto his shoulders. They started to glow a brilliant purple asnthe beetle lifted off the ground. \"I'll be filthy, stinking richnin no time! Nice doing business with you,\" he enthused, pumpingnthe toad's hand energetically. \"Your Royal Highness,\" henaddressed Cornelius, all over respectful, bowing in mid air. He shotnout the door, trailing neon. \"I told them I'd shine again!\"nwere his last words as he vanished off into the night. Grundel dropped Wink, who landed with a bump on his rear end andnstared mournfully after his departed wings. Cornelius gave Cobalt a shove towards Grundel and the toad seizednhis arms. \"Time to get moving,\" said the Fairy, sheathingnhis sword.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six \"Do we...er, knock?\" Thumbelina walked slowly round the still, blue pool, twisting hernskirt nervously. \"I don't know,\" she told Cecil quietly.n\"I've never spoken to a Nixie before. I've never even seen one –njust a painting. And it wasn't a very good painting.\" Thumbelina and the bat had arrived at the pool early that morning.nThe Fairy had felt at once that there was something... unique about the pool; although she'd be hard-pressed to say why. For one,nthere was absolutely no animal life on, in, or around it – not ansingle dragonfly or mosquito, even. The pool itself sat serenely innits environment, deep turquoise and smooth as glass. Thumbelinandidn't doubt for a second that there might be Fey living in itsndepths. But she wasn't so sure they'd be friendly. After their initial examination of the pool, Thumbelina and Cecilnhad helped themselves to a nearby bramble of wild blackberries beforenreturning to gaze curiously at the water for signs of life. \"I did see something here before,\" Cecil brokenthe silence, only slightly defensively. \"I believe you,\" Thumbelina told him. \"Infeel...that there's something – or someone – here. But where arenthey?\" she mused. \"Maybe we'll have to swim.\" The Princess chewed her lip. \"I think I forgot to mentionnbefore: I can't swim.\" She stared at the ground. \"I'm afraidnof drowning,\" she mumbled. Cecil caught the shame in her voice and touched her on thenshoulder. \"No worries,\" he told her. Any element can bendangerous, even deadly, if you get too much of it at once. It's whynwe only take one breath at a time, right?\" Changing the subjectnback to the Pool, the bat rubbed one eye. \"Well...Maybe wenshould try chucking something in, yeah?\" \"That seems a bit...crude.\" At once Thumbelina floatednoff of the ground, her wings fluttering. \"I'm going to take ancloser look,\" she told the bat. \"Stay here.\" And shenglided out over the water. Cecil didn't offer up a protest; he just stood on the bank,nwatching Thumbelina almost anxiously. Thumbelina flitted almost to the center of the pool; she gazedndown at her perfect reflection in the ripple-free surface. Was therentruly no one here? It seemed impossible, with the strange feeling shenhad. She watched her reflection, entranced, as she imagined her facenchanging – from rounded features with cornflower-blue eyes andnlight brown hair to angular ones with charcoal-grey eyes and blacknhair...and blue skin... Thumbelina barely had time to open her mouth to scream as a pairnof blue hands shot out of the pool to seize her by the legs and dragnher under. Suddenly everything was water – choking, swirling water.nSeveral pairs of hands gripped her now, and she was being draggednforcibly down, down deep, deeper. It was all she could do to not scream, to not suck in a lungful of water and drown on the spot. Herneyes bulged in terror; her long hair formed a honey-colored cloudnaround her face, shielding her captors from view. She had been underntoo long! She let her breath out in a stream of bubbles; she couldnhold out no more. And then she was flung, gasping and sopping, onto a hard, coldnfloor. \"Get up.\" Thumbelina's hair was still in her face, streaming icy water. Shenwas being prodded with something sharp. \"The Chief will want to see you,\" said a second voice.nAnd the Fairy was hauled, coughing, halfway to her feet and draggednbodily across the floor. Thumbelina only managed to get her hair swept aside as she wasnthrown to the floor yet again, her knees making sharp contact withnthe stone. She gaped around at the chamber she was in. This was not a natural cavern. The walls were heavily ornamentednwith many small, smooth, colored pebbles, pushed into the dirt as tonform geometric patterns. The ceiling was extremely smooth, andnappeared to have been coated with an even layer of sand. Simple dipsnsat in carved stone candelabras mounted on the walls, bathing thenchamber in an even light near as bright as the daylight outside. The room was filled with people. They were the same size,nThumbelina noted at once, as Fairies, and they were similar innappearance. But they had blue skin and black hair that hung in ropes,nand their ears (were they ears?) fanned out on either side of theirnfaces like fins. Their wings were thick and wide, and not transparentnlike Fairies'. Every one of these people were muscled and armed withnspears, and were evidently warriors. But what struck Thumbelina thenhardest was the fact that there were women present as well as men,nand both sexes seemed equally strong and fierce. They all wore simplenclothing, obviously fashioned with the intention of not hinderingnmovement; there was not a dress in the lot. The men were shirtlessnand many of the women sported bare arms and midriffs. No one worenshoes. Thumbelina had never seen anything like it. \"Stand up, Fairy.\" Obviously impressed and shaken, Thumbelina looked round to gaze atnthe speaker, who was an especially formidable-looking woman warriornseated on a sort of seat built into one wall. This woman wore a bandnof entwined reeds on her head and Thumbelina guessed correctly thatnshe was the leader. The Fairy stood, and curtseyed respectfully. \"Stand up straight ,\" snapped the Leader, who hadnnever cared for curtsying. Thumbelina straightened up immediately.n\"State your business here,\" the blue woman ordered. \"I – I am Princess Thumbelina of the Flower Fairies.\" \"I did not ask you for your title .\" \"I'm sorry,\" stammered Thumbelina. \"I came to seeknthe Nixies.\" The Leader sat back. \"We are the Nixies,\" she stated.n\"Why does a Fairy seek us?\" \"Because my people are in grave danger.\" Thumbelina,nemboldened, stepped forward. \"I need...I need help.\" The blue woman stood up slowly, and Thumbelina now retreated anstep. \"I am Chief Vezuvaali of the Nixies of the Still Pool,\"nshe intoned, and every Nixie in the room bowed their head. \"AndnI do not give assistance to trespassing Fey who cannot help their ownnkind but must come crawling like worms to beg favors from mynwarriors.\" Her grey eyes narrowed as she appraised Thumbelinancoldly. \"Are you a worm, Princess Thumbelina?\" Affronted, Thumbelina narrowed her own eyes. \"I am not,\"nshe replied. \"And I am not so foolish as to sit around weepingnover my misfortune rather than go seek help from beings I had heardnrumored were mighty warriors!\" If this angered Vezuvaali she did not show it. \"Sharp tonguesngain no favor from me,\" she said evenly, sitting back down. \"Wenare not vigilantes; my warriors only aid other warriors in battle.\"nShe arched a fine black eyebrow. \"Are you, then, a warrior?\" In response Thumbelina snatched a spear from a surprised Nixie andnpointed it at the Chief, who now drew back a little. \"Do younwant me to fight?\" she gasped, her wings trembling innindignation. \"Do you want me to prove that my people have beennstolen? My people! \" she cried, whirling to jab the spearnat every nearby Nixie. \"I'll fight,\" she exclaimed, turningnback to Vezuvaali, her eyes blazing. \"I've come this far. I'llnfight to the death if I have to. Perhaps it is too late to save mynpeople anyways. But I will not curl up and die!\" Vezuvaali, clearly angry, opened her mouth to speak; but at thatnmoment there was a commotion at the back of the room and Cecil, hisnwings bound to his sides, was tossed with an \"Ooomph!\" ontonthe floor, accompanied by the distinctive sound of wet fur hittingnstone. A couple of warriors took advantage of the distraction tonseize Thumbelina while a third confiscated the spear. \"We caught this beast swimming in the Pool,\" stated anwoman warrior, stepping out from behind Cecil with five other guards. The Chief struck her fist on an arm of the throne. \"Insolentnanimal!\" she growled at Cecil. \"Most know better than tonbathe in the domain of Fey.\" She waved an arm at the guards.n\"Throw him in the dungeon.\" \"No!\" cried Thumbelina, trying ineffectively to lungenout of her captors' grasp. \"Throw her in as well,\" added Vezuvaali disdainfully.n\"I've grown tired of her shrill voice.\" Thumbelina waited until the Nixies who had thrown her in her smallncell had left before bursting into tears. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o When Cornelius woke up it took him a few moments to remember wherenhe was and how he had gotten there. Last night the Will o'Wisp Cobalt had directed them to the edge ofnthe bog; when grassy, solid ground was in sight Grundel had releasednthe cursing Dark Fey and he, Cor, and Buzzby had collapsed where theynstood from sheer exhaustion. That was the last thing Cornelius couldnremember. He sat up stiffly, aching all over from hours of wading throughnmud, and compulsively checked his cobweb bandage. It was,nastoundingly, still in place. Lurching to his feet, Corneliusnreflected on the remarkable webspinning abilities of some unknownnspider out there when he heard a loud splash from up ahead. It wasnthen that he realized that Grundel was nowhere to be seen, althoughnhe did spot Buzzby, still asleep, not six inches away. Limping painfully, Cornelius followed the sound of water until henreached a pool. It was deep blue and devoid of your typical pondnlife, save for some bubbles and ripples near the edge where Cornstood. Cornelius knew at once that this was the Pool of the Nixies; therenwas something surreal about the whole place, everything was entirelyntoo...still. Except for this commotion in front of him. Warily,nCornelius drew his sword. Nixies, from what he had heard, soundednlike a dangerous lot, and he wasn't taking any chances. He tensed asna shape suddenly broke the surface. It was Grundel. Cor exhaled loudly and put his sword away. \"What are you doing? \" exclaimed the Prince asnGrundel climbed up onto a rock and wrung out his pom hat. \"Thisnpool is inhabited by Fey! Possibly hostile Fey! You don't gonswimming in a pool inhabited by Fey!\" Grundel rolled his large wet eyes towards Cornelius. \"Why?\"nhe said shortly. Cor rolled his own eyes in response. \"It's...well, it'sndisrespectful, for one,\" he answered. When Grundel looked at himnreproachfully he translated: \"It's rude.\" The toad hrmphed loudly. \" They rude,\" hengrowled huffily. \"Pond for all animal share! Not for greedynwater Fairies keep for selves! I swim where I like .\" Andnto emphasize his point, Grundel dove back into the water. \" Grundel! \" shouted Cornelius in exasperation.n\"He's going to get us killed,\" he told Buzzby, who hadnambled over to see what all the commotion was about. Scowling,nCornelius turned his back on the Pool and wandered over to the samenblackberry brambles Thumbelina and Cecil had visited not two hoursnearlier. Buzzby followed him. \"Well there's no reason to starvenover it,\" the Prince went on, picking a few berries for himselfnand the bee. But when Grundel didn't reappear after about twenty minutes,nCornelius became uneasy. \"That toad picked a terrific time to hibernate,\"nmuttered Cor, stepping back up to the edge of the Pool and trying tonpeer in. The surface was too reflective to see through. He called thentoad's name, hesitated, and then called again, louder. No response. \"Great.\" Cor frowned and put his hands on his hips. Henturned around. \"Buzz,\" he said, \"we're going to havento – \" But that was as far as he got. Cornelius was dimly aware of Buzzby charging forward, droningnindignantly, as someone grabbed him from behind and dragged himnunderwater. His captors pinned his arms to his sides, making itnimpossible to draw his sword, and he felt the water rushing past himnas he was carried swiftly downward. Suddenly, they were rising at annangle, and then he was out of the water and thrown onto a cold stonenfloor. \"WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?\" Cornelius was on his feet in an instant, his sword drawn andnpointed at the one who had spoken. It was Vezuvaali, and she wasnlivid. \"Fairies! Animals!\" The Chief was purple with rage. \"Nonone disturbs my Pool! Lock him up! \" Suddenly Cornelius was surrounded by a dozen well-muscled Nixiesnof both genders, all of whom were equipped with spears that theynjabbed at the Fairy, trying to disarm him. In a spurt of gold sparkles, Cornelius shot upwards and dartedndown a corridor, the dozen guards following hotly on foot. Henimmediately came across another group of Nixies, who were facing offnwith a very angry Grundel. Evidently they were trying to bind hisnlimbs but were coming off the losers. Nixies were being tossed leftnand right as Grundel, magnificent in his rage, was kicking andnpunching and cursing in Spanish and all in all posing quite a problemnfor the guards. When he spotted Cornelius he roared and lunged at thenFairy's pursuers, most of whom wisely turned and ran the other way.nThe toad, chasing the majority of the Nixies, vanished around ancorner. But Cornelius still had a few determined guards after him. He spednon down the corridor and down a winding staircase, the three warriorsnrunning along after him. He realized that their thick wings must benmore useful for swimming than flying, else they might have overtakennhim. As it was Cornelius, damaged wing and all, moved a lot fasternand soon left them behind. But he knew they would surely catch up. As Cornelius paused momentarily to catch his breath, he foundnhimself leaning against a window set with thick glass. A windowndidn't seem to belong in what felt like a dungeon but then henremembered he was underwater, not underground. Peering out throughnthe window he made out the swimming form of Grundel, who hadnevidently found his way back into the Pool; only now, he was the onenbeing pursued. Dozens of armed Nixies – whose speed underwaternmatched the toad's – dogged his every move. Cornelius, who had beennglad that the big toad had diverted the majority of the warriors offnof his own tail, now began to worry. There were certainly too manynfor the toad to handle all by himself. Cor made to go back up thenstairs to help his companion when a sound from below made him pause.nIt was an unfamiliar voice, speaking a familiar name. \"Thumbelina?\" it said. \"Don't cry. We'll be outnof here soon – I feel it in my ears.\" A gasp tore itself from Cor's throat and he whirled to dart to thenbottom of the stairs. \"Thumbelina?\" he cried, straining tonsee in the darkness. \"Thumbelina, are you here?\" \"Cor – Cornelius? Cornelius! \" Seconds later Cor was pressing his beloved's hands through thenbars of her cell. \"Oh, Thumbelina!\" he exclaimed, his voicenwavering. \"I was afraid...\" He glanced over his shoulder.n\"I'm being followed. I have to get you out of there. Standnback.\" Thumbelina released the bars and pressed herself against the backnwall of the cell. Cornelius struck at the lock on the door with his sword and itnfell away in two pieces amid a shower of sparks. Thumbelina hurriednforward, pushing the door open. Cornelius seized her by the wrist andnturned towards the stairs. \"I'll have to fight our way out,\" he said. \"Wait.\" Thumbelina pulled away. \"Cecil.\" Cor frowned at her over his shoulder. \"Thumbelina, what – \" \"We have to free Cecil!\" replied Thumbelina, hurrying tonanother cell. Although it was a larger cell than the one Thumbelinanhad occupied, the bat inside was painfully cramped. \"It's nice to be remembered,\" said Cecil. In another shower of sparks, the lock on the bat's cell wasnbroken. But at that same moment, the three Nixie guards were uponnthem. Cor darted into the fray immediately, but after only onenswordthrust he was suddenly seized around the middle by a pair ofnlarge feet and carried through the air up the stairs. \"Sorry but this match has been cancelled due to survival,\"ncalled Cecil, trying not to squeeze Cor too hard. On the bat's back,nThumbelina pointed ahead and shouted: \"Look out! \" They had reached the top of the stairs, where Vezuvaali and fournguards were waiting. Cecil squeaked and flapped, knocking a couple ofnthe Nixies down, and circled high around the chamber. \"There's the exit!\" called Cor, pointing to the waterynhole in the floor that he had been ferried through. \"We'll havento swim for it.\" \"Oh dear,\" murmured Thumbelina. Cecil released Cornelius and the Prince flew up to sit in front ofnThumbelina. \"Hold on to me,\" Cor said over his shoulder.nThe Princess nodded numbly. Below, the five Nixies were guarding thenhole as if daring the bat to try and escape that way. There wasncertainly nowhere else to flee. \"I don't much fancy it,\" Cecil muttered, \"butnI'll give it a go.\" And he darted through the hole. The five Nixies dove after them, not jabbing with their spears butnrather grabbing at Cor and Thumbelina, trying to pull them off ofnCecil. But Thumbelina held fast to Cornelius and Cornelius grippednthe bat's vest for all he was worth and they broke free, Cecilnswimming towards the surface like a miniature manta ray. In moments Cecil was flopping onto the bank. Cornelius rolled offnof him, coughing violently. \"Thumbelina,\" he sputtered, wiping water from his eyes.n\"Are you okay? Thumbelina?\" But Thumbelina wasn't there.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven She didn't know which way was up. Thumbelina drifted along, turning end over end. She had slippednoff of Cecil's back moments before the bat had broke the surface andnnow she was disoriented, not knowing which way to swim. She couldn't,nas she had pointed out to her friends more than once, even float, andnit was impossible to tell where the surface of the pool was. Shentried to look for the sun but the light in the water seemed to comenfrom everywhere, not from one direction. A bubble escaped her lips.nShe needed to breathe. A sort of numbness overtook her heart. It'snfunny, she thought. I'm not even afraid. Then something encircled her waist and she was being propellednforward until she suddenly broke the surface, where she gasped andnchoked. \" Thumbelina! \" The voice belonged to Cornelius,nswooping down and seizing her hands to pull her out of the water asnthe something around her waist slipped away. But before Thumbelinancould say anything, Cor's face changed abruptly to a white mask ofnpure horror. Everything happened very fast: a black shadow fallingnupon them, a great splash behind Thumbelina followed by somethingnslamming down into the water just a centimeter from the Princess'nback; and then a shower of water drenching both the Fairies as thensomething leapt back up and flapped away overhead. It was a hugenwhite stork. And it was trying to swallow something. Cornelius' voice came back to him at last. \" NO! \"nhe wailed, just as Buzzby, wings whirring, rushed up to him. Cornreleased Thumbelina, who hovered there, shaken, as the Prince leaptnonto the bee's back. They sped off after the bird. \"Thumbelina!\" shouted Cecil from the bank, startling thenFairy out of her shock. She flew to him quickly. \"What – What happened? \" she cried. Cecil was fairly dancing with excitement. \"You fell off mynback!\" he gasped, trembling. \"You would have drowned for sure! But then the biggest toad in the world popped upnwith you under his arm and then... pow , this great bird dropsnfrom the sky and swallows him up – \" \"Oh no ,\" Thumbelina gasped, running around to hopnon Cecil's back. \"We have to go after them!\" o o o o o o o o o o o o o o \"Go Buzzby, go, GO! \" Cornelius' urgings, as usual, were not necessary. Buzzby knew thatna life hung in the balance and his flight made a gold-and-blacknstreak in the sky. Ahead of them the stork flapped lazily, not awarenthat it was being pursued. Therefore it only took moments for Buzz tonreach the bird's head. Cornelius jumped off of the bee and dropped to the side of thenbird's long red bill. The stork was having difficulty swallowing thenbig toad. Cor reached right into the murderous beak and seizednGrundel's right ankle, just starting to slip out of view. \"You fiendish monster! \" Cornelius heard himselfnscream. \"Let go of my friend! \" That got the stork's attention. Still flapping along, it burblednaround its meal and whipped its head from side to side, trying tondislodge the clinging Fairy. Cornelius held fast. At least the storknhad stopped trying to swallow. The bird couldn't handle this distraction. It plunged to thenground – they were back in the swamp – and started trying tonbrush Cornelius off against the vegetation. Surely this would havencrushed the Fairy if Buzzby hadn't chosen that moment to divebomb thenbird's head and jab his stinger in the bald patch Cor had made thenlast time he had tangled with the stork. This was just too much. With a scream of surprise and agony, thenstork coughed up its intended meal, sending Grundel – andnCornelius, who was still clinging to the toad's ankle – splat intonthe bog. Making no end of offended noises, the stork spread its greatnwhite-and-black wings and flew away. Cornelius groaned and sat up as Buzzby landed and butted himnviolently. He looked around. Beside him Grundel lay in a crumplednheap. He appeared lifeless. Cecil and Thumbelina arrived to find Cornelius rolling the bigntoad over onto his back. Grundel was a decidedly untoadlike shade ofnpale green. Cor put his ear to the toad's chest. \"Cornelius! Oh...Cor...\" Thumbelina landed beside hernhusband and put her hands to her mouth. \"Oh, he isn't..?\" Cornelius sat up slowly. He appeared dazed. \"I...\" henmumbled, then seemed to see Thumbelina for the first time.n\"Thumbelina,\" he gasped, and, rising, embraced her. \"Thankngoodness...At last, we're together again...\" Thumbelina held him tightly. He was shaking. \"Of course wenare,\" she said reassuringly. Behind them, Cecil stepped up tonthe still form of Grundel and sniffed at him tentatively. \"We'llnnever be apart again,\" the Princess went on numbly. She gave angreat shuddering sigh. \"He saved me,\" she gasped atnlength, swiping at tears. \"When I first heard he was with you Indidn't know what to think...\" Cor stepped back, passing a hand over his face. He felt veryntired. \"I know,\" he said quietly. \"He was a bit of anhandful but...I guess he was my friend.\" After all, that's whatnhe had called the toad minutes earlier, as he was on his way down thenstork's throat. \"I'm so sorry,\" said Thumbelina miserably. \"Hey ducks,\" spoke up Cecil so suddenly that the twonFairies looked over at him in surprise. \"This toad's stillnkicking.\" They both rushed over. \"What?\" exclaimed Cornelius. Hengrabbed Grundel's wrist and probed for a pulse. \"There's nonheartbeat.\" \"Well he's in shock, isn't he?\" said Cecil. \"See,nthis here's a cold-blooded fellow, yeah? They go in shock,neverything all but shuts down. It's called a Death-Like State.nDefense mechanism, keeps the fussier predators away – \" \"Cecil, what do we do? \" prompted Thumbelina. \"What?\" Cecil blinked, losing his train of thought. \"Oh.nPut him in the sun. Before everything shuts down for real.\" Indeed, overhanging willow trees blocked the sun from most of thencold swamp. A patch of strong sunlight sat on the edge of the marsh,nseveral yards away. Cecil slid his wings under Grundel's shoulders as Cor andnThumbelina each took one arm. They pulled. Grundel didn't budge. \"Someone needs to lay off the flies,\" remarked Cecil asnthey all paused to rest. In a sudden whoosh of air, Jacquimo was among them. \"Eh, having some trouble, I see?\" the swallow askedncuriously, gazing at the scene before him. \"Jacquimo,\" gasped Thumbelina in surprise. \"We neednto move him,\" she explained hastily, forgoing all furtherngreetings in light of the current situation. \"But he's toonheavy.\" Jacquimo frowned and rubbed his beak thoughtfully. \"Perhapsnyou could ask all those blue Fairies who are running this way tonhelp,\" he suggested. And indeed, the group found themselves suddenly confronted withnabout three dozen Nixies, led by Vezuvaali herself. \"Stay back!\" cried Cor desperately, drawing his swordnand leaping forward. \"I see that you rescued the toad,\" said Vezuvaali,nignoring the Prince's threat. \"Was it you who drove away thenWhite Bird?\" Cor grit his teeth. \"It was. But my friend will die if wencan't get him warm.\" As could be expected, Nixies knew much about amphibians. \"Innshock?\" mused Vezuvaali. \"Then we will move him into thensun.\" And she nodded over her shoulder. The Nixies swarmednforward and started levering sticks underneath Grundel. Cornelius, Thumbelina, Cecil, and Jacquimo stepped back andnwatched as the Nixies hefted the sticks to their shoulders andncarried the toad, not to the nearby sunny patch, but back towards thenPool. The four friends could do nothing but follow. When they gotnthere, Grundel was placed on a warm rock in a patch of strongnsunlight. Jacquimo and Cecil stood watch over him. Before Cornelius could thank the Nixies for their help, Vezuvaalinturned to him and put a hand on his shoulder. \"My people thanknyou,\" she said. \"The White Bird has swallowed up more thannone careless child. None of my warriors have been able to stop it.nBut perhaps now it will leave our Pool alone.\" Cor nodded as she released his shoulder. \"You are welcome,\"nhe said, \"but I hope there wasn't too high a cost.\" Henglanced towards Grundel, who had not yet stirred. \"Your companion will be well,\" said the Chief, and shenstroked her jawline thoughtfully. \"I wonder, however, if thenPrincess – \" she looked steadily at Thumbelina – \"stillndesires our help to save her people? For, as I said earlier, we donnot hesitate to aid fellow warriors in times of need.\" Thumbelina was puzzled. \"But...But it was Cornelius who savednGrundel and drove off the stork.\" She dropped her gaze. \"Inam no warrior.\" \"The strength of the group cannot always be judged by thenstrength of the individual,\" shrugged Vezuvaali, and she turnednand walked away. The Fairies gazed after her in some confusion for a moment beforenturning to one another again. \"I think we have an army,\"nCor grinned. Jacquimo suddenly hopped up to the Fairies. \"Come quickly,\"nhe chirped. \"Our cold-blooded ami has revived.\" Cornelius brightened immediately, pressed Thumbelina's hand, andnhurried to follow the bird. Thumbelina smiled and trailed after himnat a small distance. Cor knelt beside Grundel, who was groggily attempting to sit up,nhindered by Cecil, who was trying to get him to lie down. \"Getnoff,\" the toad grumped, pushing the bat away. \"Eh, FairynPrince,\" Grundel grunted as Cornelius gripped his shoulder. Thentoad touched his head. \"Somebody sneak up on me, I think.nThumbelina, she no drown?\" \"She's right here, my friend,\" Cor grinned as Thumbelinanstepped up on the toad's other side. \"You saved my life,\" spoke up the Princess, smilingngently at Grundel. \"And Cornelius...he saved yours.\" \"It was Buzzby, really,\" returned Cor modestly. As if in reply, Buzzby strolled out of the grass, carryingnGrundel's hat, which had apparently also been spat out by the stork,nin his mandibles. He laid it on the ground beside his master andndroned complacently. Cecil patted the bee admiringly. \"It was an awful big stork,\"nhe chimed in. \"You're right lucky.\" Grundel finally succeeded in sitting up, and he blinked atnCornelius and Thumbelina. Then he shook his great green head. \"Ees nada ,\" he disagreed. \"Is two times now I should bendead. Is only three times is lucky.\" He grinned at Cor. \"I'llnhave to try again.\" Cornelius laughed. Thumbelina made a show of rolling her eyes. \"Men,\" shensaid to Vezuvaali, who had just stepped up beside her to see how thentoad was doing. \"If they're not trying to kill each other,nthey're trying to kill themselves.\" The Nixie Chief had to laugh at that.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight The Fairies and animals set up camp that night on the edge of thenPool, politely declining an invitation to spend the night in thenunderground fortress. None of the party was particularly keen onnbeing below ground, especially not on such a clear starry evening.nGranted, the stillness of the area surrounding the Pool was a bitndisconcerting but they neatly offset the quiet by inviting Jacquimonto tell stories, a role the showy swallow filled grandly. Henshowboated before the fire, weaving tales of magic and romance as thenothers watched and listened with interest. Several Nixies, unaccustomed to performance art, seated themselvesnaround the camp as well to catch the night's entertainment. Vezuvaalinherself joined the inner group with the intention of discussing thenjourney to the Kobolds' mountain, but that had been postponed for thentime being as everyone enjoyed Jacquimo's stories. At last the bird, at the completion of a fable, swept off his hatnand bowed, indicating the end of his performance. He sat down amidnspirited praise and applause. \"A most interesting method of storytelling,\" observednVezuvaali as Jacquimo drank some water from a rolled-up leaf Cecilnhad fetched for him. \"Nixies simply state the facts of anventure, without all the added…commentary. It takes far less time.nBut I admit this way is much more gripping. You are a very talentednbird,\" she complimented Jacquimo, who bowed with a respectfuln\" Merci, madamoiselle . \"Perhaps,\" added the swallow, \"someone else wouldnlike to tell a story.\" Cornelius held up a hand. \"I have a better idea,\" henchimed in. \"You're going to love this,\" he whispered tonThumbelina, then stood up. \"How about a song?\" Cecil's ears perked up. \"Fairysong!\" he exclaimed,nwhipping out his journal. \"I've always wanted to hear Fairiesnsing.\" Cor smiled and shook his head. \"Not meaning to disappoint younCecil,\" he said, moving out of the firelight, \"but I hadnsomething else in mind.\" He walked up to Grundel, who had beenndozing beneath an overhanging rock. \"Psst, Grundel,\" henhissed, giving the toad's shoulder a push. \"Come croak for us.\" Back at the campfire, Vezuvaali arced an eyebrow. \"The…toad?\"nshe queried flatly. Grundel opened one eye and gazed balefully at the Prince. \"Isnthis about women again?\" he asked cynically. Cornelius tugged on his arm, and the toad reluctantly got to hisnfeet. \"Sort of,\" the Fairy grinned impishly. He draggednGrundel into the firelight, and threw a glance in Thumbelina'sndirection. \"Please,\" he addressed the toad, \"will younsing the same piece from before, two nights ago? I'll owe you one.\" Grundel rolled his eyes. \"Again he save life, and he want owenme one,\" he asided to the curious audience. He turned back tonCornelius. \"I sing different opera, yes?\" The toad peerednout over the assembled Nixies. \"War opera, maybe. Valkyries.\" Cornelius shook his head. \"No, no, no,\" he countered.n\"The same one.\" Grundel shrugged, unfazed. \"As you like,\" he agreed. Cornelius hurried back to his seat as the toad made a show ofnbrushing out the wrinkles the eager Fairy Prince had made in hisnsleeve. \"What's this about?\" Thumbelina queried, mystified. Cornelius took her hand. \"You'll see. Jacquimo, do you speaknItalian?\" \"Ah, oui .\" \"Would you translate for us?\" Before Jacquimo could ask what exactly he was to translate,nGrundel, at last content that his appearance was satisfactory, begannto sing. After getting over his initial surprise, the swallownwhispered the opera's translation, loud enough for those assembled tonhear but not quite so loud as to disturb the toad: I would like to pour my happiness into her dear heart! Inwould like my happy throes of love to create as many harmoniesnin the heavens as there are planets, ah! to fly with her tonheaven and soar aloft to where no mortal treads! Thumbelina closed her eyes and clasped her hands together inndelight as she listened. Like Queen Tabitha she had instantly lovednthe Royal Opera the first time she attended a performance (it wasnindeed one of the main things she and the Queen enjoyed doingntogether), and she recognized a fine performer when she heard one.nShe really had no idea Grundel could sing like that (she'd never hadnopportunity to find out, really). Cornelius didn't close his eyes.nHe was watching his beloved's face, enjoying her enjoyment. When,nabout halfway through the piece, Thumbelina turned to the Prince andnwith a murmured \"Oh, Cornelius\" pressed herself into hisnarms, Cor at last allowed himself to believe that his Princess was nonlonger angry with him. It was a great relief. Nixies do not amuse themselves with song; songs and music arenprimarily used to motivate workers and battalions during marching orntraining. None of the warriors present, Vezuvaali included, had evernheard anything like this, and they were frankly floored. When Grundelnreached the end of the piece and swept off his hat to bow, the Nixiesncheered louder than anyone else. \" Bravissimo! \" crowed Jacquimo, applaudingnheartily. Cecil gave a standing ovation. \"Sensational!\" hencongratulated the toad, who, like the seasoned entertainer he was,nremained in the firelight to accept his kudos. \"I thought I'dnreally been around, but I never heard anything like that.\" \"It's peculiar,\" mused Vezuvaali, gazing thoughtfully atnGrundel as he bowed before the Fey. \"I always thought animalsnjust…made noise.\" Surprisingly, Grundel took no offense to this remark. \"Is allnkinds noise,\" he informed the Nixie Chief as he replaced hisnhat. \"Any kind noise better than nothing at all.\" \"I think he's saying it's entirely too quiet around here,\"nsupplied Cecil helpfully. \"Perhaps,\" agreed Vezuvaali, stroking her jaw. The othernNixies looked at each other curiously, but their Chief said no morenon the subject. Cornelius jumped up and clapped Grundel on the back before thenamphibian could escape back to his rock. \"Nice croaking, Toad,\"nthe Prince beamed at his friend. \"I mean it, I really thinknyou'd make it big in the opera. You will sing for the FairynCourt, won't you, after…\" He trailed off, not wanting to sayn\"after we rescue them\", because it weighed heavily on his mindnthat they may not be able to after all. He coughed and went on: \"AndnI'm sure there'd be a place for you in our Royal Opera…if younwanted to stay.\" But Grundel lowered his eyes and did not reply at once. Corneliusnfrowned at him. \"Please stay with us,\" he urged. \"The Valencould be your home. You should have a home.\" \"What is this you say?\" blurted out Jacquimo, alarmed.n\"Haven't you got a home, ami? \" Thumbelina frowned. \"But,\" she said, \"what about yournfamily?\" She frowned deeper in concern. \"Did something happen tonthem?\" Grundel looked away, embarrassed, and Cornelius regrettingnbringing the subject up in front of the others. Behind him he wasnaware of the Nixies quietly excusing themselves and diving into thenPool for the night. \"I shouldn't have said anything,\" thenPrince said quickly. \"Are you in trouble, old chap?\" asked Cecil anxiously. \"You can tell us,\" said Jacquimo. \"We are your friends, non? \" Grundel flicked his eyes briefly in the swallow's direction,nhesitated, and then grunted quietly. Thumbelina got up and took thentoad's arm. \"Come and tell us about it,\" she said persuasively.nGrundel allowed himself to be tugged to a fallen branch near the fire and sat heavily. The Fairies sat on another branch and everyonenlooked at the toad expectantly. After a sigh, Grundel started. \"I want say,\" he said slowly,nlooking at Cornelius, \"I finish do show. Big show. Mama's show,nall show. Ees finito . You say before join opera, I tell younno.\" Cornelius looked at his feet, abashed. \"Yes you did,\" henreplied. \"I am sorry to push you.\" Grundel went on. \"Small show, few people - \" here the toadnindicated the campsite with a nod of his head – \"ees okay. Ees nonmany strangers, ees no money. Money ees…no good. I tired money.\" Thumbelina nodded in understanding. Mama Toad wasn't the onlynperson she had met who was concerned with making money; the Mole hadnsurrounded himself with so much wealth it had almost frightened her. \"I decide, in Spring, that I want leave show,\" Grundel wentnon, speaking to everyone. \"Mama no want stop show, so I leavenfamily.\" He sighed again and fiddled with his left sleeve. \"Inwant find place to live, not have do show for money.\" He fidgeted anlittle and looked contritely at Thumbelina. \"I want findnThumbelina, but she marry Fairy Prince. Ees good,\" he said firmly,nto Thumbelina's relief. \"I go away alone.\" Jacquimo was moved. \"So sad,\" he said. \"No one should be allnalone.\" \"But where were you going?\" Cecil wanted to know. Grundel shrugged. \"I think find pond, live there. Sing when wantnto.\" The toad got a faraway look in his large eyes and he sighednyet again. \"I think, be like Papa. Papa ferryman. He sing, too;nsing for free. Animals come from many mile hear him sing, ride innferry even when they have no place to go. We poor. We have nothingnbut mud, but Papa happy. Want be like that.\" \"That's beautiful, mate,\" sighed Cecil. Jacquimo nodded. \"Ah, oui , it is the simple life that isnthe happiest.\" Thumbelina touched Grundel on the arm. \"That sounds like a nicenplan,\" she told him with a smile. \"It sure does,\" agreed Cornelius. Then after a pause he added,n\"except for one problem.\" The toad lifted an eyebrow at him. \"Eh?\" he queried. \"You hate mud.\" The toad and the Prince looked at each other for a moment; thennthey both laughed. \"Um, I think we missed something,\" Cecil whispered tonThumbelina and Jacquimo. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o \"Don't thrust too hard or you will be thrown off balance. Usenyour own weight to your advantage.\" \"But I don't weigh very much!\" Thumbelina adjusted herngrip on the spear. \"What if the enemy is bigger than I?\" Vezuvaali smirked. \"Even better. Use their own weightnto your advantage, then.\" Thumbelina practiced thrusting a couple of more times, then restednthe butt of the spear on the ground. \"Hm,\" she saidnthoughtfully, the corner of her mouth turning up. \"MothernTabitha would have a fit if she saw me training with a weapon.\" \"She would do better to encourage you,\" countered thenNixie. \"It is foolishness to forbid combat training. If yournpeople had all been carrying weapons they were proficient with, theynwould not have been spirited off by Kobolds in the first place. Andnyet,\" she added as Thumbelina sighed, \"it does no good tondwell on past events. They cannot be changed. Now block me.\" Andnshe drove her own spear at Thumbelina, who stumbled backwards andnawkwardly managed to parry. At the break of dawn the animals and Fey had flown/hiked/hopped tonthe nearest rivulet where construction of a medium-sized boat wasnbegun. It was intended to hold the animals and the Fairies; the Nixienwarriors would swim, of course, while harnessed fish would pull thencraft along. This rivulet, Vezuvaali had assured the travelers, wasnthe fastest way to reach the river, which would take them past thenKobolds' mountain. In the meantime the Nixie Chief had offered to teach Thumbelinanhow to defend herself. Although the offer was given in whatnThumbelina construed as a condescending way, she had accepted atnonce. Any chance to train with a weapon was welcome. Cornelius hadnnot argued, instead joining Grundel, Jacquimo, and Cecil in assistingnwith the boat's construction. Thumbelina didn't exactly see it as annote of approval, but they would have to discuss it later. While Grundel dove into the water to help the Nixies with thenheavy work, and Jacquimo flew off to gather reeds, Cornelius andnCecil remained on the bank to tie reeds together as the Nixies needednthem. \"Your Highness,\" Cecil asked Cornelius after a while,nglancing over at Thumbelina and Vezuvaali sparring beside the water,n\"may I ask a question?\" \"Of course, my friend,\" the Prince smiled thinly at thenbat. \"Er, well...I'm no expert, you know, well...\" Cecilnpaused and scratched one ear slowly. \"Y'see, I've always heardnthat Fairy women weren't fighters, and I...well, PrincessnThumbelina...\" Cornelius sighed and straightened up from the reeds he was workingnon. \"No,\" he said, \"Fairy women aren't trained tonfight.\" \"But...\" Cecil was confused. \"The Princess - \" \"Was not always a Fairy,\" Jacquimo interrupted, swoopingndown after dropping another reed he had collected. Now the bat was even more confused. \"Er - wasn't she?\" Jacquimo put a wing over his heart dramatically. \"Ah,\"nhe sighed, \"non. It is a tale you should hear, mon ami . Antale of romance...of despair...of...\" \"Toads,\" interrupted Cornelius. \"Ah, yes...of toads as well!\" Jacquimo nodded. Cecil had to laugh. \"Sounds like a story for the ages, thatnone,\" he remarked. \"I must hear it, then.\" \"And so you shall,\" Jacquimo told him. \"But perhapsnthis is not the right time. For now, we work.\" And he flappednaway again. \"Cornelius?\" The prince and the bat looked round as Thumbelina, minus hernspear, walked up to them. Earlier, she had swapped her tatterednlavender gown for new garments; they had been made for her by Nixiesnwho had attempted to emulate the Fairies' modest attire, and whatnthey had ended up with was a strange blend of Fairy and Nixie thatnwas somehow both unassuming and exotic at the same time. The Princessnhad twined her long hair into triple braids and then pinned thosenaround her head, leaving three loops hanging free in the back.nCornelius liked the look but wasn't sure his mother would approve.nBut then, Tabitha wouldn't approve of her daughter-in-law swinging anNixie spear, either. \"I...do you have a moment?\" Thumbelina asked hernhusband. \"I'll take over here, you go on,\" Cecil whispered to thenPrince, taking the reeds they were working on and preparing to tienthem alone. \"Thank you,\" Cornelius whispered back. He took a fewnsteps in Thumbelina's direction. \"Of course,\" he said tonher. Thumbelina hesitated. \"Cornelius,\" she said after anmoment, wringing her hands a little, \"I...I wanted tonapologize.\" Cornelius frowned. \"Apologize?\" he prompted. \"Yes...\" Thumbelina sighed. \"I should have acceptednyour mother's diamond. I don't even know why I got so angry with you.nI suppose...I suppose I felt like you were trying to turn me intonsomeone I am not.\" Cornelius walked up to her and touched her hand. \"Thumbelina,\"nhe said earnestly, \"Why would I want to turn you into someonenelse? You are the one I fell in love with, aren't you? I want you - you, the way you are. I went to an awful lot of trouble to findnyou, you know,\" he added, raising an eyebrow mischievously atnher, and she smiled. \"Here,\" he said suddenly, pulling thennecklace out of his pocket and putting it into her hand. Thumbelina held it up, and she sighed despite herself as shenexamined it from every angle. Huge. She smiled when Cecil, whoncouldn't help but notice the gem, whistled suddenly, gaping a little. \" Cor ,\" the bat gasped, opening his normallynhalf-lidded eyes quite wide. \" What a rock, mate!\" Cornelius grinned over his shoulder at Cecil. \"Familynheirloom,\" he explained. \"I was going to say! I didn't think you just nipped out tonthe market for it this morning. But,\" he paused thoughtfully,n\"I'm afraid it doesn't quite go with your current outfit, love,\"nhe nodded at Thumbelina. The Princess grinned. \"He's right,\" she informednCornelius. Cornelius threw his arms wide. \"What are you talking about?\"nhe parried. \"I thought you were combat training. It'd make answell bola.\" Thumbelina laughed, and couldn't resist swinging the necklace anlittle. The diamond threw a shaft of sunlight directly into Cecil'sneyes, and the bat, startled, stumbled backwards a little and fellninto the Pool But before the Fairies could hurry forward and help him, Grundel,nwho as usual was looking rather impatient, pushed the bat back out ofnthe water. \"What this?\" grumped the toad, looking down at the soggynbat and up at the surprised Fairies. \"I thought you help buildnboat! Not go for swim!\" He threw Cecil an accusing look. \"It's my fault, Grundel,\" Thumbelina spoke up, smilingnin contrition and hiding the necklace behind her back. \"Yes, she was showing us her combat moves,\" addednCornelius, helping Cecil get to his feet. He threw Thumbelina a grinnand she bit her lip so she wouldn't giggle. \"Oh yes,\" the bat chimed in. \"She was showing usna...secret weapon.\" This was all over Grundel's head. He looked round suspiciously atnthe three, who all looked like they were trying not to laugh. Then henrolled his eyes. \"Well learn like swimming now , you swimnwhole way if this boat no get built. Ay . Where that bird go?\"nHe turned and hopped back into the water; a trail of bubblesnindicated that the toad had swum off. \"Nice fellow but he needs to work on his manners, yeah?\"nCecil remarked after they had all enjoyed a short laugh. \"Well,nyou heard him; I'm not too keen on swimming all the way to thisnMountain. Never mind that we can all fly .\" Before Cornelius and Thumbelina parted the Princess handed thennecklace back to Cor. \"I'm afraid I don't have any pockets,\"nshe explained. \"You'll have to carry the secret weapon for now.\" \"I'll guard it with my life,\" the Prince promised her.nThey kissed briefly, and then Cornelius went back to tying reedsnwhile Thumbelina returned to Vezuvaali for her next lesson.[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine I could recount here various minor adventures undertaken by ournheroes as they sailed towards the Mountain of the Kobolds. I couldntalk your ear off about dangerous rapids and waves, about piratingnriver animals and about dissention among the ranks and even about anlover's spat; but for the sake of brevity let us skip ahead roughlyntwo weeks to the morning the Mountain came into view at last. \"Looks like a dangerous place,\" was Cecil's comment asnthey drew up alongside a moored ship. Perhaps the right size for ancrew of small animals, like water rats, it lay partially on its sidenin a state of total disarray. It had obviously been abandoned longnago. Late afternoon now, the ship lay in the shadow of the craggy,ngrey mountain, like some sort of victim. \"What danger?\" Grundel, treading water, scowled at thenship. \"River pirates.\" No one knew if he meant that the ship had been attacked by rivernpirates or had belonged to them, but the ship was quickly forgottennas Jacquimo, who had flown on ahead to scout, swooped down low overnthe water. \"I have found the entrance!\" he announced, flapping innplace as best he could. \"It does not appear to be guarded.\" \"I'll believe that when I see it,\" remarkednCornelius wryly. \"I hope you were not too obvious,\" spoke up Vezuvaali,ntreading water beside the toad. \"Visible guards or not, I amncertain anyone approaching the entrance would be seen, and noted.\" \"Chief,\" said a male Nixie, \"perhaps it is time tonabandon the boat.\" \"Yes,\" agreed Vezuvaali. \"Anchor it behind the shipnthere, so it will not be noticed.\" Cecil ferried Thumbelina to the bank, and Cornelius rode Buzzby.nVezuvaali grouped her warriors on land, after the boat had beennstashed. Grundel pulled himself out of the water unhurriedly andnwrung out his hat. \"We will walk the rest of the way,\" announced Vezuvaalinas Jacquimo flitted to land beside Cecil. \"What, even us?\" Cecil protested, glancing at thenswallow. \"Any creature approaching the lair of Dark Fey could bentagged as suspicious,\" Cornelius spoke up before the Nixie Chiefncould. \"I agree with Vezuvaali. We'll walk. It's the best we canndo.\" And so they walked. The army of Nixies slunk more than walked,nsomehow managing to make their spears and blue bodies blend into thengrey rock. The Fairies and animals felt a bit like sore thumbs inncontrast but it couldn't much be helped. \"There it is,\" whispered Thumbelina as a cave-likenopening came into view. \" Oui , that is the only opening near the ground,\"nconfirmed Jacquimo. Vezuvaali had asked him to find a ground-levelnentrance, as the Nixies could not fly. \"Do we ah, just waltz in, like?\" hissed the bat. No one had a chance to reply. All at once dozens upon dozens ofnsmall, blurred shapes hurtled from everywhere to fling themselvesnbodily upon the warriors, shrieking shrilly. They seemed to have nonform, and they darted in and out of the fray with lightning speed asnthe Nixies hacked and slashed and jabbed with their spears valiantly. \"Filthy Pesties!\" swore Cornelius, unsheathing his swordnand swinging at a shape as it zoomed past. He brought his arm backnand elbowed an oncoming shape head-on and it tumbled, its formnstabilizing and finally becoming completely visible as the creaturentumbled to the ground clutching its nose. It was a small, wingednhumanoid, roughly thigh-high to a Fairy, with barely defined facialnfeatures; furry, it wore no clothes. The Pestie rolled to its feet,nshook itself a bit, and with an angry hiss at the Prince, darted awaynbefore it could be seized. \"Nasty things,\" Cornelius remarked to Grundel andnJacquimo. \"They can...blur themselves and change colors to blendninto their surroundings. And as you can see they are fast. But theynare dreadful cowards.\" \"The Nixies, they are winning!\" commented Jacquimo,npointing. Indeed, the ground was already littered with a large numbernof motionless Pesties. But Cornelius shook his head. \"Notnnecessarily,\" replied the Prince. \"We Fairies have an oldnsaying: 'For every Pestie that you see, there's a hundred that youndon't.' Vezuvaali!\" he shouted, trying to find the Nixie Chiefnin the mass of fighting blue bodies. \"We must retreat!\" Vezuvaali extricated herself from the army quickly at the summons.n\"My warriors never retreat! They - \" she began. But Cornelius wouldn't wait for her to finish. \"Pestiesnoverwhelm by sheer force of numbers,\" he told her sharply. Henpointed at the cave entrance. \"We should make a run for it now!nVezuvaali, you must listen to me!\" he went on as the Chiefnnarrowed her eyes at him. \"We may not have another chance!\" The Nixie army was beginning to disappear behind a cloud of blurrynforms; the Pesties' ranks were increasing at an alarming rate.nVezuvaali was not so obstinate that she would risk her people's livesnfor her pride. \"Warriors, follow your Chief!\" she shouted,nspear raised; and she turned and fled towards the cave. Cornelius andnThumbelina ran after her, and the army, with a collective shout, didnthe same. Buzzby flew overhead. \" Palo loco! \" shouted Grundel, looking over hisnshoulder as he and Jacquimo started to flee. \"What is he doing?\" The toad was referring to Cecil, who had pulled out his journalnand quill and was now scribbling notes furiously. When they dartednback to seize him by the wings and drag him towards the cave, the batncried out in protest and waved his quill around. \"No!\" henyelled. \"I need a sketch! Do you know how few people have evernseen a Pestie at rest?\" The toad and swallow ignored him. \"We'll never make it!\" Thumbelina cried, jabbing hernspear left and right at the swarming Pesties. Indeed the cavenentrance was still yards distant. \"We need more help!\" Cornelius suddenly had a brainstorm. \"Help,\" he mutterednto himself, and looked round wildly to locate Grundel. \"Grundel!\"nhe shouted, trying to stave off several Pesties at once. \"Cannyou sing for help?\" The toad didn't need to be asked twice. Releasing Cecil's wing hencharged back towards the river, knocking Pesties every which way asnhe went. Moments later his sonorous croak could be heard, repeatingnover and over for a minute or so. \"Hey!\" Cecil blurted as a Pestie seized his journal andnsnatched it away from him. \"Anything but that! You rotten littlenblighter, give it back!\" The bat charged into the fray, swattingnthe evil little Fey that had swiped his book mercilessly with onenwing. \"I'm only trying to make you famous you know!\" Thumbelina grunted as she thwacked a Pestie that had been clingingnto her leg with the butt of her spear and sent it tumbling a goodnfoot. Her clothes were in tatters. She pressed her back to Cornelius'nand they fought that way for a while. \"When will this end? \"nthe Princess moaned. \"Perhaps now,\" replied Jacquimo, ducking as a toad leaptnover his head and knocked several Pesties out of the air. \"Toads!\" exclaimed Vezuvaali in surprise as toads of allnages and sizes, responding to Grundel's call, threw themselves uponnthe Pesties. \"And they fight for us! But - how? And why?\" Cornelius shook his head at the Chief. \"You really couldnstand to learn a thing about the animals you forbid from your Pool,\"nhe told her, trying not to sound too cross. Cecil stumbled back to them then, looking a bit shabby butntriumphantly clutching his journal. \"Them toads sure can put upna fight,\" he said wonderingly, watching the amphibians swattingnPesties left and right while the Nixie warriors drove off severalnmore. \"All clear, now, yeah?\" \"Yes,\" said Cornelius. He turned as Grundel hopped up.n\"A fine job,\" he commended the toad. \"Thank them allnfor us quickly; we must get inside the cave before those cowardsnregroup.\" But Grundel shook his head. \"Fairy Prince go in cave, findnother Fairies,\" he said. \"I stay here, help toads keepnpests from following.\" \"Won't you come with us?\" asked Thumbelina,ndisappointed. Grundel gazed at her a moment. \"Is better I stay, guardncave,\" he told her. \"Besides,\" he added as annafterthought, \"is about time I see some entusiasmo! \"nHe gleefully punched a Pestie in the nose and sent it careeningncrazily into a clump of grass. \"You go,\" he told thenothers, then hopped off. \"I stay as well,\" spoke up Jacquimo jumping up andnhovering in the air. \"Someone must keep an eye on our impetuousnfriend. Good luck, mon amis! \" he bade them, swoopingnafter Grundel. The Fairies, Nixies, and bat headed into the cave, plunging intonthe semidarkness. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o \"Do not turn your head. We are being followed.\" Cornelius tried to do as Vezuvaali ordered, but it was veryndifficult to curb the impulse to look behind him. \"For hownlong?\" he hissed to her. \"Not even a minute,\" the Chief replied quietly. \"Theynare Kobolds,\" she added before Cor could ask. Cornelius swallowed and tried not to break his stride as thencompany ventured deeper into the Mountain. \"They've cut off ournescape, then,\" he muttered. \"Cornelius..?\" whispered Thumbelina, who had overheard. \"We must keep on,\" replied the Prince edgily. \"We'vencome this far, we must at least find our people.\" \"It is a trap,\" said Vezuvaali. \"They are herdingnus towards more evil Fey.\" She looked sternly at the Fairies.n\"We must part now.\" Now Cornelius couldn't help turning his head, to look at the NixienChief. \"What?\" he said. \"You two make a run for it. My warriors and I will staynbehind to keep the Kobolds from pursuing you.\" She inclined hernhead slightly. \"Until our currents cross again.\" The warriors seemed to know instinctively what order Vezuvaali wasnabout to give; as one they turned at her cry and rushed back down thenpath, spears readied. Cornelius didn't wait to see the Kobolds springnfrom the shadows; he seized Thumbelina and a moment later Cecil, withnthe Fairies on his back, was flying swiftly down the tunnel. It was just as well that the bat was put in charge of navigation,nas the light from the mouth of the cave had run out at last, and allnwas pitch blackness. Knowing that Cecil couldn't speak while usingnecholocation, the Fairies didn't ask him if he knew where he asngoing, and just clung tightly to his vest and to each other as thensounds of battle died behind them. Cecil swooped and dove and twisted and turned in his flight,nmaking both Fairies rather nauseous (and reminding Cornelius of ancertain toadback ride). This went on for several minutes, untilnfinally Cecil's path straightened out. \"We're in a cavern,\" the bat called, taking a briefnpause from navigating. \"There's only one other path: up.\" \"Then take it,\" Thumbelina told him; and then Cecil wasnflapping upwards in a sharp ascent. Cornelius was troubled. It made sense to him that the kidnappednFey would be held captive in some sort of underground chamber, notnhigher up in the mountain. But before he could voice his concern annoverpowering blast of wind roared through the cavern, taking the batnby surprise. With a squeak he tumbled backwards, the Fairies fightingnto remain on board. The wind intensified, filling Cecil's fragile wings and literallynhurling the bat downwards. Fearful of being squashed under the batnshould he strike a flat surface Thumbelina and Cornelius were forcednto take to the air, the sparkles from their wings illuminating nextnto nothing in the dark chamber. The wind ceased as suddenly as it began and the Fairies, findingneach other, hovered in place. \"Cecil!\" called Thumbelina in fright. \"Cecil, wherenare you?\" \" Cecil! \" shouted Cornelius. There was no reply. \"Oh Cornelius, what will we do?\" worried Thumbelina.n\"Where are we? How will we find our way out?\" Cornelius, clinging to her, didn't reply right away. He lookednaround, straining his eyes - and then he noticed it. \"Thumbelina, there!\" he pointed, turning the Princessntowards the barest hint of light above them, several feet away. \"Donyou see it?\" he asked her, worried that his eyes might benplaying tricks on him. \"I do,\" she said, and they flew to an opening in thenceiling of the chamber, leading to a huge, dimly lit cavern. Theynfluttered up into it hesitantly and gazed around. Both Fairies sawnthe same thing at the same time; they dropped to the floor, stillngrasping each other's hands, and went rigid. There were seven Fairy-like beings sitting cross-legged in thencenter of the chamber; they were slender and beautiful and very pale,nwith delicate features and near white, flowing hair. Their wings,nquadruple like dragonfly wings, shimmered with iridescence, and theynwore delicately colored robes of the finest silk. But it wasn't theirnloveliness that the Fairies noticed: it was the pure, spine-chilling,nundeniable evil that literally poured from them, washing overnCornelius and Thumbelina like deadly fumes. The Fairies stoodnpetrified. A shaft of light emanating from a crack in the ceiling above wasnpooled in the center of the circle, and the strange people werendipping into it with their hands and drinking from them, appearing tonbe drinking the light itself. The whole scene was downrightnfrightening. One of the people looked up and rose to her feet without bendingnher limbs or fluttering her wings; she moved creepily, like she wasnsuspended from strings. Her companions went on drinking, greedily,nwhile she drifted towards the Fairies, her head cocked. She driftednquickly then came to an abrupt stop, stared intensely and, withoutnmoving her mouth, lips, or tongue at all, spoke: \" Circle circle never ending; circle always inward wending;nhead for home but always fail; trapped inside my twisted tail .\" Her voice was clear and distinct, and both Fairies (who werendeeply frightened) imagined that perhaps she was using telepathy andnthe words had been projected directly into their minds. But in anyncase what she said made no sense; it was clearly a riddle, though thenfact that she didn't possess a tail just intensified the strangenessnof the situation. Behind her, the others went on gulping theirnhandfuls of light. Thumbelina clutched at Cornelius' arm with both hands innopen-mouthed horror, slowly edging away. Cornelius came to himselfnand drew his sword. \"Are you the Master of this mountain?\" he wavered,ntrying to keep his voice steady and his eyes locked to the woman's. But the woman stood mutely, hovering just slightly above thenfloor. Her head was still cocked. \"Who are you?\" whispered Thumbelina hoarsely. \" We are the Unseelie ,\" the woman's voice murmurednin their heads; and it was echoed by six other voices whisperingn\" Unseelie ,\" out of synch. The Unseelie. Fairylore was vague, perhaps deliberately so,nregarding these most Dark of Fae. They were not a race but more of anclan, consisting of whatever Fae was evil-hearted enough to joinntheir number. They were not ordinary Dark Fey, who lived lives ofntreachery, filled with hate for others. The Unseelie were Hate, and Lies, and Death. But Fairylore spoke of the Unseelie Court, where hundreds of thesenevil beings gathered. Who was this lonely group of seven? And wherenwere the kidnapped Fey? Cornelius' gaze drifted to the pool of light,nand up to the crack in the ceiling... The Prince pushed Thumbelina away from him, pointing his sword atnthe Unseelie woman. \"Where are the rest of your black-heartednclan?\" he shouted, gritting his teeth. \"And what do younplan for our people? And the other Light Fey? Speak, woman!\" hendemanded when there was no reply from the woman and the others keptndrinking. \" Circle, circle, we will come full circle. And you willnnever leave this place ,\" came the reply; and she rose intonthe air a few inches, her wings fanning. The others, who had stoppedndrinking all at the same time, darted over to hover in a circlenaround the Fairies, all dangling as if supported by invisiblenstrings. \" Your magic will fill us and bring us back ,\" saidna voice apparently belonging to one of the male Unseelie, though itnwas impossible to know which one had actually spoken. \"Back?\" whispered Thumbelina, staring. \"Back from where?\" \" Back ,\" replied the woman who had spoken to them first.n\" Back from the Circle Never Ending. Back from where they sentnus .\" The seven Unseelie drifted forward an inch, causingnThumbelina and Cornelius to shrink together. Cornelius' swordntrembled. \"Who are 'they'?\" he demanded, the strain of his fearnmaking him angry. \"What is this Circle you speak of?\" \"'Circle always inward wending...trapped inside myntwisted...'\" Thumbelina frowned. \"A riddle?\" \" Some say a Fairy is a riddle, and riddles are Fairies ,\"nreplied the woman, her eyes fixed on Thumbelina. \"What's the answer?\" Cornelius asked. \"I think,\" said Thumbelina, who enjoyed riddles, \"that it'sna...spiral?\" At that Cornelius' eyes widened. \"I know who you are!\" hensaid abruptly, tightening his grip on his word. \"You are thenUnseelie who were cast into the Spiral!\" He glanced at Thumbelina,nwho he knew had been spared that particular nightmarish tale. \"Thenseven Unseelie who betrayed the Unseelie Court and were spirited intonthe...yes, the 'Circle Never Ending'! My kind know of you,\" hentold the woman guardedly. \"But what do you mean our magic willn'bring you back'?\" He paused for a moment, and then with ansuddenness that startled even himself, he lunged forward and thrustnhis sword through the woman's heart. Thumbelina gasped and jumped, but the seven Unseelie did notnbudge. Cornelius' sword had encountered nothing solid. The womannand her companions, though visible, were simply not there physically. \"You're still in the Spiral,\" stated Corneliusnaccusingly. \"I don't know how, but you're only projectingnyourselves here. That light.\" He indicated the shaft of light thenUnseelie had been drinking from. \"What is that light?\" ThenUnseelie stared at him, still as statues, and his courage grew.n\"Magic? The magic of the Light Fey? They're up there, then?\" Henstarted fluttering upwards, and Thumbelina clutched at him in fright,nstaring at the Unseelie. \"Cornelius, don't!\" she hissed, petrified. \"They're not really here,\" the Prince replied hotly, tuggingnfree and continuing his ascent. \"They've only been commanding thenKobolds and Pesties to obey them, they can't really harm us.\" But there Cornelius was wrong. All together the Unseelie raisedntheir arms and Cornelius was struck by a purple, crackling thread ofnmagic that knocked him out of the air and sent him screaming to thenfloor. Sobbing, Thumbelina threw herself upon him as the Unseelienturned wordlessly and, kneeling again at the pool of light, beganndrinking it with their hands. \"Oh Cornelius, Cornelius,\" moaned Thumbelina, clutching hernhusband's tunic. He was alive, and trembling, but did not respond.nEven trapped in another place the Unseelie were dangerous andnpowerful enough to hurt, probably even kill them – but how can onenfight against someone who wasn't really there? The Prince andnPrincess had no magic. Thumbelina felt the huge diamond throughnCornelius' tunic, and pulled it out to gaze at it mournfully. \"I'mnsorry,\" the Princess said to no one in particular. Then she looked up fearfully to watch the Unseelie, who werenwholly ignoring her now, engrossed in their intent drinking. If theynneeded to absorb the magic, why not just stand in the shaft of light,nor fly up into the chamber above? Why only consume it one smallnhandful at a time? She had a sudden flashback of standing beside thenPool of the Nixies and telling Cecil she couldn't swim. And Cecilnhad said something...something about taking one breath at a time,nwhat was it? \" Any element can be dangerous, even deadly, if younget too much of it at once .\" When Thumbelina walked right up to them the Unseelie finallyndeigned to notice her. They stopped drinking and looked up at hernstanding beneath the tilted shaft of light, a large diamond on anchain in her hand. \"You drink our magic like it is water,\" shensaid, a bit unsteadily, as the Unseelie all stared piercingly at her.n\"But even though we need it in small quantities to live water cannkill us when there's too much, and when you can't swim.\" Shenswallowed and gripped the diamond tighter. \"Can you swim?\" shenasked them, and, reaching upwards, held the huge faceted diamond innthe beam of magic streaming from the ceiling, and squeezed her eyesntightly shut as reflected light drenched the chamber. At once she wished she could close her mind as well. The Unseelienwere screaming, screaming not aloud but as they spoke, with voicesndirectly inside her head; screaming in waves as each of them lostntheir grip on this world and faded away to return wholly to thenSpiral in which they had been cast. When the horrible screamingnstopped Thumbelina collapsed into a fetal position and sobbed. Shencould feel that the evil Fey had gone and she was relieved, but shenwas still horrified by the whole ordeal and wished with all her heartnthat she and Cornelius were somewhere else.[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten \"Thumbelina? Thumbelina, wake up. Please. Please wake up.\" When Thumbelina opened her eyes, she found herself lying on anwooden floor under a blue sky, with her husband bending over hernworriedly. He broke into a relieved grin and drew her into his arms. \"Cornelius!\" she gasped into his shoulder. \"What happened?\" The Prince shook his head. \"I still don't know,\" henadmitted. \"I just woke up, myself.\" He flushed, embarrassed. \"Thenbiggest defeat in generations of my people and I slept through it.\"nHe looked at Thumbelina. \"But don't you know whatnhappened? The Unseelie – they're gone! Was it you? Did you defeatnthem?\" Thumbelina didn't answer right away; instead she looked around.nThey seemed to be on the deck of a ship sized for small animals; shencould feel that they were moving but somehow it didn't feel likenthey were floating on water. She was bursting with curiosity to knownwhere she was, but she didn't have to wait long. \"Thumbelina!\" exclaimed Cecil, appearing suddenly besidenCornelius. \"How about this ship Grundel got for us, eh? Isn't shena beat? Not exactly seaworthy but airworthy enough, right?\" \"Airworthy?\" repeated Thumbelina in surprise. She climbed tonher feet and ran to the rail. The ship – it was the same one theynhad spotted upon their arrival at the mountain, she realized – was flying . Far below them was a lot of green that she knew mustnbe the tops of trees. But then she remembered something far morenimportant. \"Cecil!\" she cried, flinging herself upon the bat. \"OhnCecil, thank you.\" \"He fetched us both out of that mountain,\" Cornelius spoke up,nnot knowing to what Thumbelina was really referring. \"He flew backnand found us and carried us both out of there.\" \"Found your rock, too,\" added the bat, pulling the Queen'sndiamond necklace out of his vest and handing it to Thumbelina. \"How is this ship flying?\" she asked the bat as she took thendiamond. \"Look again,\" replied Cecil with a chuckle, pointing over thenside. This time Thumbelina leaned way out and discovered the means ofntheir locomotion: hundreds of Pesties, all supporting the ship fromnbelow as they flew through the air. Buzzby flew alongside, like anprison warden keeping his charges in line. \"But why are they carrying us?\" Thumbelina asked in wonder. \"Because,\" replied Jacquimo, strolling up to the group, \"ourngreen ami is very persuasive.\" He pointed to the prow.nThere, standing stoically at the helm, one hand on the wheel and thenother gripped tightly around the neck of an abnormally large,npetulant-looking Pestie, was Grundel. \"He found their leader, younsee,\" added Jacquimo. Thumbelina laughed and clasped her handsntogether. \"But Thumbelina,\" urged Cornelius, \"do you know whatnhappened to the Unseelie? Are they gone? Did you defeat them?\" \"Oh yes, Cornelius,\" Thumbelina smiled back at him. \"Yes, Inthink so.\" \"But how?\" The swallow and bat echoed him with \"Yes how?\"snof their own. Thumbelina paused, then held out the diamond. \"Our secretnweapon,\" she said, grinning. \"It was too flashy even for thenUnseelie.\" After Thumbelina explained in more detail what she had done,nCornelius took the diamond from her, folded the chain, and tucked itnaway in his tunic. \"Well I think under the circumstances Mothernwon't mind having it back.\" He grinned. \"In fact, Father maynwant to put it on show in the Palace. Where are the Nixies?\" henasked suddenly, noticing the absence of their blue-skinnedncompanions. \"Alas, they did not wish to fly with us,\" replied the swallow. \"They swam home,\" interjected the bat. \"They did drive offnall of the Kobolds though.\" \"That's too bad,\" said Cornelius, a little deflated. \"Inwanted them to meet – Jacquimo!\" he cried, stricken. \"Where arenthe Fairies?\" To his and Thumbelina's surprise, Jacquimo and Cecil bothnlaughed. \"No worries, mate,\" Cecil said. \"They're all safenand sound. Them and all the other Light Fey those Unseelie had holednup in that Mountain. Leprechauns and Brownies…so many notes tontake. I ran out of room in my journal,\" went on the bat sadly,nspreading his wings - which the Fairies could now see were coverednwith notes, sketches, and diagrams. \"But where – \" \"Your parents are below,\" Jacquimo interrupted Cornelius.n\"They have been waiting for you. We thought you would revive betternin the open air.\" Cornelius heaved a sigh of relief. \"Thank you, Jacquimo,\" hensaid. He started for the cabin doors, but then changed his mind andnheaded for the prow instead. Smiling, Thumbelina followed him. Grundel's wide stony face broke into a grin when he saw thenFairies approaching. \"Eh, Fairy Prince, you wake from nap? Eesnfighting bad not-Fairies too much, you have lie around all day likenmold on log?\" Cornelius laughed and punched the toad in the arm. \"I just wokenup to make sure you weren't eating anybody,\" he replied, and thennpulled a sneer at the Pestie, who was watching him warily. \"AlthoughnI could always make an exception.\" The Pestie grumbled, butncouldn't help casting an apprehensive look at the big toad. Thumbelina stepped forward and to the toad's surprise flutterednup to throw her arms around his neck and kiss him on the cheek.n\"Thank you for all your help, Grundel,\" she told him. \"You arenextremely brave, you know.\" The toad, unable to reply, merelyngrunted in response, though he darkened visibly and had to look away.nGrinning, the Fairies took each other's hands and went to see thenKing and Queen. Epilogue \"Colbert, don't fuss so. I'm quite all right.\" \"Well I apologize. It just isn't…proper, you know.\" Tabitha tutted and arranged a silk cushion as best she could onnthe bench of the small boat. \"Colbert, my love,\" she said,n\"finery isn't only found in fine places. You should know that.\"nShe turned then and smiled at the ferryman. \"Wouldn't you agree,ndear?\" Grundel took her hand and gave it a gentlemanly kiss, and shenblushed becomingly. \" Si , ees true,\" he replied. \"It mustnbe, if you are here.\" Tabitha tittered and Colbert shook his head.nGrinning, Grundel released the Queen's hand, dipped his punt backninto the water, and burst into song. On the bank of the pond, Cornelius and Thumbelina stood together,nwatching the moon reflect on the water, while Buzzby groomed himselfna few inches away. The pond lay within the boundaries of the FairynKingdom, and the Prince and Princess had been delighted when Grundelndecided to set up house there. Since he wasn't keen on performingnin the Palace, Tabitha agreed to travel to the pond for hisnperformances – once the Queen had heard him she'd needed nonfurther persuasion. Thumbelina had encountered Berkeley Beetle a few days after theirnreturn to the Vale, as he was founding a new nightclub nearby.nReceiving his fine new wings had made him quite friendly towards her,nand he had agreed to take a message to Grundel's family to let themnknow where the toad now lived, in case they wanted to see him. Theynhadn't made an appearance as of yet, but then, as Berkeleynreported, they were scheduled to appear in London next month. Speaking of London, Cecil had decided to head back there to worknon getting his recent findings on mythological beings published. He'dnpromised to come back as soon as he could. Jacquimo, as always, could be counted on to drop by frequentlynwith news of Thumbelina's mother, of the Jitterbugs, and ofnhappenings in Paris. As Cornelius had predicted, King Colbert took the diamond and putnit on display in the Palace. It had, after all, helped defeat sevennpowerful Unseelie, although Thumbelina herself was credited with thentriumph. Thumbelina was proud of the surge of interest the youngnFairy girls had in hearing her tell of her adventure over and overnagain, and she hoped that one day, Fairy women might train for combatnalongside the men. Of course, she also hoped it would never actually be needed. Story completed March 2007. Thumbelina belongs to Don BluthnStudios. The Spiral Riddle is ©Cloud Kingdom Games and can benfound in their book \"Lair of the Sphinx\". \"À lanclaire fontaine\" (\"At the clear fountain\") is a Frenchnchildren's song. The opera Grundel sings is from the Italian opera \"InLombardi\" (or \"I Lombardi alla prima crociata,\" \"ThenLombards On the First Crusade\") by Verdi. \"I Lombardi\"nwas first performed in 1843 so I know it's not early enough for Thumbelina, which supposedly takes place in the 17th century.nI don't know when \"À la claire fontaine\" wasnwritten, so it may also not be early enough.

Both beasts, each the size of skyscrapers, grappled like enormous sumo-wrestlers, buildings crumbling all around them. She held the curved necklace in her hand tight until she could feel it pierce her flesh and draw just a prick of blood. The earth shuddered beneath her feet due to the sheer fury of the clashing titans as their roars reached fever pitch . \"Cuz. Hey, cuz!\" A voice began to split the sky, drowning out even the thunderous sounds of battle. \"KIRI, WAKE UP!\" With a shriek, Kiri Tsunade rolled out of bed, ejected from her dream, and was greeted with the sight of her younger cousin, Yukari. The sixteen-year-old currently was wearing her school uniform and had tied her hair into a tight ponytail. \"Yukari,\" Kiri spoke up, trying to keep her anger inside due to being woken up at such an early time, \"there are better ways of waking me up you know.\" Yukari rolled her eyes, \"Whatever, Mom told me to wake you up, because, oh I don't know, we have to get ready for school !\" Kiri groaned and looked at her clock. \"Alright, fine, I'll get ready.\" Yukari grinned and walked downstairs while Kiri pulled herself out of her bed sheets. \"We've still got thirty minutes before school starts, it's no big deal.\" she muttered. After washing up and getting dressed in her uniform, Kiri stood in front of a mirror and brushed her short black hair. Afterwards, she walked over to her calendar, currently set on the month of May, days marked all up to the 26th and etched out the day before with a black marker. She sighed and looked at the box resting next to her futon, a note reading \"Do not open until your nineteenth birthday. -Love Mom.\" Today's my birthday. Kiri thought, Maybe I'll open it up when I get back. \"Come on, Kiri!\" Yukari shouted from downstairs. Kiri groaned and snatched up her backpack as she headed downstairs to the living room... or in this case her Aunt Kanna's café, the Genbu. At barely 7:30 am, the café was already getting its first customers sitting down and starting the day with donuts, traditional Japanese breakfasts consisting of Miso soup and rice and coffee. At the register, Kanna, a spritely woman in her late 30's collected the customers' yen while, in the kitchen, her partner Kenji \"Kenny\" Ichinose helped prepare more baked goods. Kanna was currently dressed in her work clothes; an egg-blue apron with a sewn, purple chibi turtle on the front. Upon seeing her daughter and niece, she waved at Kiri. \"Glad to see you're up, birthday girl!\" she cried out. \"Glad to be nineteen.\" Kiri droned as she snatched up a donut. \"Hey, Aunt Kanna? Did my mom call yet?\" Kanna shook her head. \"No, she didn't. Sorry, sweetie.\" Kiri lowered her head before hoisting up her backpack. \"'Kay, just checking.\" \"I'm sure she'll come eventually, Kiri. Keep holding your head up.\" Kiri gave her aunt a small smile before walking out the door. Yukari was about to follow before Kanna cleared her throat, eliciting a groan from her daughter. \"Yes, Mom?\" \"I heard how you woke your cousin up. What have I told you?\" \"Don't push her out of bed. Got it, Mom.\" With that, the sixteen-year-old followed her cousin out the door as Kanna watched with a sigh. Kenny poked his head out of the kitchen as though he were listening to the whole thing. \"You're gonna have to tell her eventually, Boss.\" he told her. \"I know.\" Kanna sighed. At school, Kiri could barely stay awake while her teacher, Mr. Yuasa, lectured the class about the G-Incident of the 50's, what with Yukari waking her up so prematurely. As Yuasa droned on and on about the incident, Kiri slumped into sleep. Once school was done, both cousins walked back to the Genbu while Yukari reprimanded Kiri. \"Seriously? You can't even stay up for even one lesson? What's gotten into you?\" \"Maybe, it's because you woke me up by pushing me off the bed.\" Kiri snarked. Yukari rolled her eyes, \"That explains why you're so cranky today. Well, crankier .\" \"It's also because today's my birthday.\" Yukari raised an eyebrow at her cousin's comment, \"Really? You're cranky when it's your birthday? You're turning a year older, cuz. That should be reason enough to celebrate!\" \"It's not just that, Yukari. It's just that, I would at least like to spend it with my family.\" \"You already have a family! You have me, you have my mom, our uncles, our aunts, our grandparents, Kenny-\" Kiri groaned, \"That's not the point! I meant spend it with my parents.\" Her voice lowered somewhat, \"You know, with my mom and with my dad.\" Yukari sympathetically patted her cousin on the shoulder. It had been sixteen -soon to be- seventeen years since Kiri's father died and her mother disappeared, just a day after her own father up and left her and Kanna. She was only two-years-old. \"Don't worry, Kiri. I'm sure your mom'll come back. Now, how 'bout you perk up a bit. It's your birthday!\" With that, both cousins walked together shoulder-to-shoulder back to the Genbu. However, Kiri had no idea her life was going to change. Underneath Kiri's bed, the wrapped box began to glow as if anticipating the inevitable.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Egg The Genbu was packed full of Kiri's relatives, from cousins to aunts to uncles and even her grandparents. Kanna was currently passing around various finger foods such as hot wings, pork gyozas and more, filling the café with mouth-watering smells. Kiri's younger cousins were currently running around, hopped up on sugar while their parents tried to rein them in. Kiri watched as this happened and drank her berry punch, letting the fruity-flavored, carbonated drink flow down her throat before being elbowed by Yukari, holding a glass of punch and a hot wing in both hands. \"Having fun yet, cuz?\" she asked with a smile. Kiri gave her cousin a small smile. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" \"That's the spirit, Kiri!\" \"Yeah.\" Kiri looked toward the door as if expecting a woman to come in and ask if she saw her daughter. \"I just wish my mom was here.\" Yukari groaned, \"You're still going on about your mom?\" Kiri rolled her eyes, \"No, I'm dreaming about a world without wars or traffic accidents for the sake of humanity.\" Yukari rose an eyebrow, \"You know I'm no stranger to sarcasm, right?\" Kiri gave her a cheeky smile. \"That I am, Yukari. That I am.\" Yukari mock laughed, \"Oh, ha ha ha. I think they're about to cut the cake, birthday girl.\" Kiri chuckled and went over to the round birthday cake which had just come out of the kitchen, decorated with blue and purple icing and, in its center, stuck out a nineteen-shaped candle with red icing spelling out \"Happy Birthday, Kiri!\" As Kiri took her seat, her guests began to sing the birthday song as the now nineteen-year-old thought about her wish. As soon as the song was done, the girl opened her eyes, took a deep breath and blew out her candles. I wish my mom would come back soon . she quietly wished as her birthday guests cheered. As soon as that was done, Kanna whistled for everyone to listen to her. \"Alright, everybody line up in single file if you want a slice. No cutting in line.\" she announced before turning her attention to an eager-looking ten-year-old wearing a turtle shirt \"That means you too, Toshiro.\" she told him, eliciting a groan from the boy. After two hours of celebration, talking with relatives and teeth sinking into finger foods and marble cake, the guests finally left as Kenny helped Kanna take down the decorations, including a large \"Happy Birthday\" banner. Meanwhile, Kiri was upstairs sitting on her bed, already dressed in her pajamas, counting the wad of birthday Yen given to her by her uncle Shusuke. \"Twenty-one thousand... twenty-two thousand aaaand twenty-three thousand yen.\" she muttered to herself as she straightened out her birthday money. \"And so, Uncle Shusuke continues to spoil me.\" The door opened and in walked (or rather stumbled) Yukari, looking rather queasy. \"I swear, I never want to see another piece of food for an eternity.\" With that, she flopped on her bed, not bothering to take off her clothes. \"Or at least another piece of chicken.\" Kiri looked at her cousin and put her hands to her cheeks in fake surprise, \"Giving up your favorite food? Oh, no! It's the apocalypse! Yukari's quit eating chicken!\" she cried in mock horror, causing her cousin to glare at her. \"You're not being funny, you know.\" she snarled. Kiri shrugged, \"That's what you get for over indulging on them.\" \"Good point.\" Yukari groaned before moaning over her angry stomach. With that, the nineteen-year-old got off of her bed and reached underneath, this caught Yukari's attention as she sat up a bit, her hand still on her belly, \"What are you doing?\" \"Getting my birthday present.\" \"But you've got enough presents today.\" her cousin pointed out, gesturing to the yo-yo, the origami how-to book and the book about lost cities resting by the corner of their room, \"Not to mention, Uncle Shusuke gave you enough money to buy more.\" \"This is a present from my mom.\" Kiri told her as she popped her head up, \"Okay, come to Mama.\" she muttered as she pulled out the box and placed it on her bed. With that, she began to peel off the wrapping paper and opened the box and pulled out its contents. The first was a comma-shaped bead hanging from a black metal Kiri had never seen before. Not only that, but it began to glow green, concerning Yukari. \"You sure you want to wear that thing? It could be radioactive!\" she cried. This prompted the nineteen-year-old to roll her eyes. \"I sincerely doubt that.\" Yukari frowned, \"Fine, but don't come crying to me when you start growing a third arm from your head in the morning.\" Kiri chuckled and began pulling out the second and last item in the box to which she rose an eyebrow. \"What the-?\" \"What?\" Yukari asked. She got her answer as her cousin rested a large, white, oval-shaped object the size of a Cocker Spaniel on her bed. \"It looks like an... egg.\" Kiri commented as she examined her birthday present. \"So, let me get this straight - urp- .\" Yukari started before getting interrupted by a small burp, \"Your mom -my aunt- gave you a possibly nuclear necklace and an egg.\" Kiri shrugged, \"Who knows, could be a fossil. And for the last time, I really don't think the necklace is radioactive.\" Yukari was about to respond when what sounded like a tapping noise filled the room. \"Was that a bird?\" she asked. With that, she shrugged, \"Anyway, what I was going to-\" Crack Kiri and Yukari jumped as the egg's shell cracked. \"Kiri, I don't think this is a fossil.\" \"And your first clue was-?\" Another crack split the egg as bits and pieces of shell decorated Kiri's futon. Both girls gathered around the hatching egg as they waiting for the baby to pop out. Just then, an egg tooth split through the shell as the hatchling crawled its way out of its white, ovular confinement and onto the mattress. It was-! It was-. It... was... \"A Snapping Turtle?\" Yukari asked. Sure enough, the small creature on Kiri's bed did in fact look like a Snapping Turtle, it had a long, trailing tail, a ridged shell and a small head with a sharp beak. Yukari gave a grimace to her cousin, \"So let me get this straight; your mom's present to you consists of a possibly nuclear necklace and a Snapping Turtle egg? Wow.\" she sarcastically commented. \"Would you stop calling this radioactive?\" Kiri snapped, holding up her necklace. \"Besides, I really don't think it's a normal Snapping Turtle.\" Yukari rose an eyebrow, \"Really, because it looks like one, it has a long tail like one, it has a ridged shell like one and it has a head like one. Ergo, it's a Snapping Turtle. \" \"How about because it's bigger than what it should be and it has tusks?\" Sure enough, upon closer inspection, Yukari could see small tusks poking out from each side of the baby turtle's lower jaw. \"Okay, let me rephrase that; a possibly mutated Snapping Turtle. Probably because of the necklace.\" Kiri groaned \"It's not radioactive! Also, I think he has something on him.\" \"He?\" Kiri pointed to the turtle's tail and front claws. \"Thicker tail and longer claws.\" Yukari then saw Kiri pick up the baby turtle and carry him over to her desk. \"Hey, be careful with that thing! Snapping Turtles have 'snapping' in their name for a reason!\" she cried as her cousin placed her new turtle on the desk and turned on her lamp. Kiri looked at the patterns on the hatchling. In addition to the mottled colors on his shell, she also noticed strange, curling red patterns all over the turtle's body. \"So, what are you gonna call him?\" Yukari asked, brushing discarded egg fragments from her cousin's bed as to sit on it. \"How 'bout... Gamera.\" Kiri replied. Yukari gave a \"what\" face. \"'Gamera'? What kind of name is that?\" Kiri shrugged, \"It just sort of came to me.\" \"In that case,\" Yukari walked over to the baby turtle and carefully stroked his head, \"Welcome to the world, Gamera!\" Just then, the newly christened Gamera sneezed... and a small burst of fire came out, leaving both girls stunned at what had happened. \"Um, Kiri?\" Yukari squeaked. \"Yeah, Yukari?\" \"Did your baby turtle just sneeze fire ?\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Midnight Cravings Yukari watched as Kiri paced back and forth while Gamera sat on her desk, oblivious to what was going on around him. \"Okay, let's recap, shall we? My mother's present to me on my nineteenth birthday just so happens to be a baby Snapping Turtle that sneezes fire. The question is, what are we gonna do with him?\" Yukari shrugged, \"We could go show him to my mom.\" Kiri gave her cousin a frown. \"Oh, sure , Yukari. I'll just go downstairs and say 'Hey, Aunt Kanna, turns out your sister-in-law left me a present I wasn't supposed to open until I was nineteen and it just so happens to consist of a necklace my cousin says is radioactive because it glows and a Snapping Turtle hatchling that breathes fire'.\" Yukari groaned, \"Well, what do you plan to do with him? She's gonna find out eventually.\" Kiri smirked, \"Not unless we hide him so well she won't know he's around.\" Yukari stammered, \"I just said she'll find out eventually. What'll happen then?\" Kiri was about to answer until she realized she really had no idea what would happen next. \"I'll think of something.\" she replied, \"Tell ya what, tomorrow, since it's the weekend, I'll look up how to take care of a turtle and hop on over to the pet shop and, when he grows big enough, we'll set him free.\" Yukari rose an eyebrow, \"Oh that's a great idea, cuz. Let out a mutant fire-breathing turtle into the wild. I don't see how that will backfire in anyway.\" Kiri frowned at her cousin, \"You got a better plan, Yukari? Because I am all ears.\" Yukari was about to say something until she too realized she had no idea. \"Okay, fine. We'll go with your plan. Not gonna be my fault we screwed up the natural ecosystem.\" \"I'm sure things will turn out just fine.\" Kiri smiled before yawning. \"Well, I've had a long day. Might as well go to sleep.\" After petting Gamera and turning off the lamp, Kiri padded barefoot over to her bed and wrapped herself up in her blanket. Not bothering to take her clothes off, Yukari yawned and folded her own blanket over her. Taking one last look at Gamera as he rested on her desk, Kiri closed her eyes and let sleep take over her. Kiri's eyes snapped open as she found herself floating in a void, her bare feet not touching any ground beneath her. It looked like she was floating in space, but every time she moved a limb, it was more akin to being underwater. Just then, voices began to enter her mind as a gigantic silhouette appeared in front of her and advancing quickly. \"The world is in danger. Protect the last guardian so that he may be old enough to fight it.\" The figure was much closer, several features being that of a round, frayed carapace on its back and long tusks sticking out from its lower jaw. \"Protect the last guardian.\" A gigantic, beaked, reptilian head emerged into full view, its sky-blue eyes meeting with her chocolate brown eyes. \" Protect the last guardian !\" With a yelp, Kiri shot up, her heart pounding and body covered in sweat. She then looked around to see Yukari, still in her bed. \"You can't catch me, evil space squid. For I am too fast for y-\" she sleep-muttered briefly before going back to silent breathing. Kiri sighed in relief, \"It was just a dream.\" She was about to go back to sleep when her hand felt something ridged next to her. She looked down and saw the moon-lit silhouette of Gamera... in her bed. \"G-Gamera? How did you... get... over... here?\" Kiri looked up at her desk and then back to the baby Snapping Turtle. She then put the turtle on the floor and watched it roam around as though looking for something. \"You're hungry, aren't you?\" she asked. The girl looked at her circular clock and saw it was only two minutes past midnight With that, Kiri stepped down from her bed, picked up the turtle and tiptoed out of her room, past her aunt's bedroom and downstairs to the café. Luckily, Kenny had left for home so she didn't need to worry about getting caught. She placed Gamera on the counter, walked over to the refridgerator and found a container full of leftover unsauced chicken wings. She opened the container and pulled out one leg which she placed in front of the baby turtle. The turtle sniffed the piece of meat in front of him. Just then, Gamera shot a small burst of fire at the chicken leg, scorching it to perfection and then began to feast on it. Well, that's one way to cook a chicken . Kiri thought as she watched her new turtle dig his beak into the charbroiled leg. In a matter of a minute, Gamera had stripped the chicken leg clean of meat, leaving nothing behind but a bone and some crumbs of blackened skin. With Gamera finished with his meal, Kiri wiped off the scorch mark with a wet paper towel, threw the bone away, picked the turtle up and closed the fridge door with her foot, holding on to its bottom with her toes to make sure it didn't slam. After all, she didn't want Aunt Kanna finding out about Gamera. With turtle in hand, Kiri tiptoed back up the stairs. She then realized the baby turtle was fast asleep and stroked his head with her finger as she entered her room. \"You're no ordinary turtle. Aren't you, little guy?\" she wondered.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: How to Care for Your Fire-Breathing Turtle The next day, Kiri hopped onto her computer and logged into Shelled . The first thing she got was a front page decorated with several moving turtles GIFs and a cute chibi girl holding an even cuter cartoon turtle with big blue eyes and an adorable smile. Her ears were greeted with a cheerful tune. She clicked on a link that read \"Taking care of your Turtle\". The link led her to a page filled with questions such as the turtle's name, gender, size, current weight, life stage and breed. For each one, Kiri typed in \"Gamera\", \"male\", \"fourteen inches\", \"ninety-six pounds\", \"one day since hatching\" and \"Common Snapping Turtle\". Once she was done, she was greeted a page with a photo of a Snapping Turtle at the top as well as several facts about the breed as well as items needed for taking care of it. After reading the page over, she printed the list. After breakfast, Kiri retrieved her list and her birthday money. \"Yukari, I'm heading out, make sure Gamera doesn't get into trouble okay.\" she told her cousin. Yukari rose an eyebrow and looked at the baby turtle. \"I really doubt he's gonna go anywhere.\" Kiri frowned at her cousin and handed her a big blue bucket filled with water. \"He breathes fire, remember?\" Yukari nodded as Kiri went out. She then turned her attention to Gamera. \"I got my eye on you, turtle.\" she warned. The baby turtle just sat still and stared into space, blinking only on occasions. Kiri walked downstairs, yen tucked in her pocket as she headed for the door. \"Kiri, where you headed off to?\" Kanna asked as she dealt with customers. \"I've gotta go spend that money Uncle Shusuke gave me before it burns a hole in my pocket.\" Kanna gave her niece a puzzled look before turning her attention to a customer looking at the donut rack. Without waiting for her aunt to reply, Kiri walked out the door and set off. After a few miles of walking, Kiri had arrived at her destination: the Kadokawa Pet Store. As she stepped in, she found herself looking upon rows upon rows of pet toys, treats and other conveniences for a pet. She took the time to look at her list. First up: a large, ten gallon fish tank. (Though with how big Gamera was compared to a normal Snapping Turtle hatchling, she would probably have to go with a fifty-five gallon tank.) Kiri grabbed a shopping cart and set off on her items quest. Back at the Genbu, Yukari sat crosslegged on her bed with the bucket of water right next to it just in case, staring at the stagnant turtle on her cousin's desk. She waited for Gamera to do something else. Well, something aside from breathing fire and being a rather large turtle hatchling. Something along the lines of transform into a giant monster or teleport or anything a normal turtle would never be caught doing. Next up on Kiri's list, once she scratched off the fish tank on accord of it in her cart, was a heating lamp. With that, she walked off in search of it. Yukari continued staring at the baby turtle. Just then, her stomach growled. With that, she slowly got up from her bed, her eyes never once leaving Gamera. \"I'm going to go get something to eat, okay? So you just stay there. Alright? You stay . Don't do anything funny, turtle.\" she snarled, giving him a \"I'm watching you\" gesture as she walked towards the stairs to get something to eat. Meanwhile, back at the pet store, Kiri had gotten done with her shopping as she waited in line with three people ahead of her at the check-out section over looking her list. \"Fish tank: check. Heating lamp: check. Filtration system: check. Sand and rocks: check and check.\" she murmered as the line decreased. Yukari, came back up the stairs to see Gamera, still in his place on the desk. With a plate full of food such as four left over, unsauced chicken wings cooked in a microwave, a healthy scoop of rice and two sticks of celery, she slowly plopped herself back on the bed and began to slowly eat her lunch, starting with one of her celery with a crunchy bite and letting its salty, watery taste wash over her tongue. With a bag full of items from the pet store in one arm, Kiri looked over the money she had left, which as now down to Ұ1000. \"Huh, whaddya know.\" she muttered. She then heard her stomach growl. She noticed the Suzaku burger restaurant next door and decided to go there. Yukari had just dug her teeth into one of her chicken wings. Even though it was soggy from the microwave, she could still taste the salty, peppery crust as it cooked in the pan. She looked up and noticed Gamera looking at her, more specifically, her chicken. \"You're hungry too, aren't you?\" she asked. As if in answer, Gamera made a swallowing motion. With a sigh, Yukari tore off a piece of chicken, walked over to the turtle and placed the piece of meat down in front of the baby turtle, which he happily devoured. Once he was done, he turned his attention to the plate resting on Yukari's bed. Yukari sighed, \"No, Gamera. This is my lunch.\" Gamera made the swallowing motion again, prompting the teenager to groan. \"Gamera, no. You can wait until Kiri comes back.\" Gamera made the motion a third time causing Yukari to stamp her bare foot on the floor. \"Gamera! What part of 'no' do you fail to underst- what are you doing?\" Upon arriving at the Genbu, popping pieces of sriracha mustard off her fingers from the Suzaku Phoenix Burger. She was then noticed by Kanna. \"Oh, Kiri. Something's going on with Yukari upstairs could you go check please?\" Kiri, puzzled, carried her items upstairs and slipped off her shoes as she neared her room, the sounds of screaming entering her ears as well as... rocket jets? Curious, Kiri opened the door just in time to see Yukari holding onto Gamera, as he flew around on what looked like jet streams coming from his hindquarters.

On his shell he holds the earth. His thought is slow but always kind; He holds us all within his mind. On his back all vows are made; He sees the truth but mayn't aid. He loves the land and loves the sea, And even loves a child like me .\" ~ children's rhyme (Stephen King, \"The Dark Tower\") Prologue To little Helen, it looked at first like the tip of a mountain, the peak of a newborn island breaking the ocean's surface. Her Papa showed her a film reel a few months before about the formation of islands, and Helen was most excited to learn that there were volcanoes under the sea. \"Some even bigger than Mount Fuji,\" he claimed. Helen doubted it. She wasn't yet 7 years old and had trouble imagining anything on land or sea bigger than her adopted homeland's iconic landmark. But, Papa explained, these underwater volcanoes exploded sometimes just like they did on land—and when they exploded the sea's floor buckled and new islands formed. The segment of the film was animated and the narrator said that islands only took shape over many, many years. This one, however, was surfacing right before her eyes, halfway between Papa's motorboat and the horizon, with nothing but the shimmering, calm ocean between them. When Helen squinted, she had to admit it didn't look like a mountain, really, not anymore. The saline waters of Tokyo Bay had cascaded off of it and what she saw now resembled a great, steel-gray wedge, oriented in their direction. It was like the armored dorsal fin of an animal from one of her picture books on ancient, extinct life. Her Papa was a marine biologist and gave her stuff like that to read, hoping Helen would share his love for the sea and all the wonders it ever contained. But all Helen felt for the wondrous, limitless sea at that moment was fear. The towering fin had turned and began to slice its way through the waves toward them. Papa and his colleague, Dr. Yosuke Ishikawa, were not moving, and neither was their boat. Kenichi, Dr. Ishikawa's son, was struggling with the belt. Ken was only a bit older than she was and Helen wasn't certain he was strong enough to get the motor running. Don't be afraid , Helen, whispered The Voice. Her invisible new companion was barely comforting. My mate will give Ken the strength he needs. She believed The Voice, but only just understood the concept of \"mate.\" The Voice, and presumably, another Voice that only Ken could hear, had just helped the children escape a submerged UFO and a spacewoman who put their fathers into a trance. --- It started out as a nice, normal day. Helen just wanted to spend time with Papa, who was so often busy with his research and his job as curator of Kamogawa Sea World. She should never have followed that mischievous Kenichi, whose father likewise worked at the park, but the boy convinced her they wouldn't be punished. Not too badly, anyway. The last hour was a surreal blur to her. Helen and Ken had stowed away on their fathers' boat and ate all their sandwiches. The water was calm, the sun shone, and she was just happy to be this close to Papa on one of his adventures. They were discovered around the adults' lunchtime, but Papa was too preoccupied to be angry with her. The biologists had seen something strange crash into the ocean. Helen saw something in the sky, too. Something that thrilled Ken but something she couldn't really understand. She didn't want to understand it. It was monstrous and ugly. It spun and trailed fire, a cyclone of flame and smoke and it frightened her. Papa and Dr. Ishikawa paid it no mind, as if this hideous, bizarre thing were as much a part of the scenery as the waves and the clouds. It was not the \"something strange\" they were looking for, anyway. Helen couldn't imagine anything stranger and wasn't listening to Kenichi's breathless exposition at all. She closed her eyes shut the scary thing from her mind. When she opened them again Helen was still in the boat, but they were no longer on the sea. Somehow, she had been transported inside a bright, circular room. The concave walls were covered with vibrantly colored machines, screens, levers, buttons, and lights arranged on tall circular panels. Ken was beside her, as were their fathers. They climbed out of the boat and before them stood the spacewoman. Helen remembered her mean face and shiny, metallic clothes. The spacewoman said she was from another planet but she looked like a young Japanese woman, pretty enough to be an actress, maybe, thought Helen. The spacewoman threatened them, and threatened the Earth. She said her name, or was it their name? She said they were... it sounded like Zigra . The spacewoman bragged that her species' technology was so advanced it could make earthquakes. She said they could easily level a city as big as Tokyo, and as their fathers pleaded, the spacewoman fiddled with some levers and buttons. A circular panel irised open and the view screen behind it revealed Japan's capital in ruins. Helen did not believe it was real. The adults and the spacewoman argued about whether or not humanity would happily surrender to Zigra. She made her eyes glow red and put Papa and Dr. Ishikawa into a trance. But then a voice from nowhere whispered to Helen, its tone pleasant and comforting. Helen didn't think anyone else heard it as it told her to stand strong and resist the spacewoman's \"telepathy.\" The Voice said it would protect her and its mate would protect Ken. The children bolted in two directions as the flustered spacewoman failed to grab them. The Voice guided them to an array of controls on the wall of the alien room. Ken moved his hands over a touch-sensitive pad. The lights went dim red and the spacewoman froze, locked in a trance of her own. The children led their catatonic fathers to the boat and Ken returned to the strange levers and buttons. My mate will give Ken the teleportation sequence , confided The Voice. While Helen didn't really understand what The Voice was talking about, she knew it meant her and Ken no harm. We must escape the Usurper and inform your people , it stated before they were awash in a yellow-green light. Transported back to the ocean's surface, Helen mustered the wherewithal to ask The Voice who it was. We are all Zigra , it confided, and Helen could almost hear it sigh. --- Kenichi had given up on the motor, deciding instead to assemble the sail. The metallic fin still made a zigzagging path toward them, and the children noticed that it was jagged, with three tapering points. The boy didn't angle the boat to shore right away in the hopes of evading the monster. For a moment, Helen thought they were saved when she spotted an old freighter in the bay. It won't help us , declared The Voice with a hint of regret. Ken must have realized it, too, or maybe his own Voice realized it for him, because he gave the vessel a wide birth. Unfortunately, the ship got between the giant fin and its prey. Helen was too young to really understand catastrophe. Her 7 year old mind couldn't comprehend the instant death of dozens or hundreds any more than it could unravel the bizarre events of the past hour. The saw-toothed fin sliced through the freighter like a knife, severing it into two flaming pieces. Helen looked away impassively as The Voice addressed her again. We are sorry , it said dejectedly, to have brought this to your people . When the fin drew so close she could see her own reflection upon its metallic plates, Helen finally fathomed tragedy and mortality—her own, Ken's, Papa's, Dr. Ishikawa's, and the poor men within that inferno of what was once the freighter, perishing from the flames or drawn forever under the crashing waves. We are sorry we couldn't save you , confessed The Voice, the Usurper closes . Ken screamed. Helen closed her eyes and put her hands over her ears. We are sorry , repeated The Voice. Helen prayed. She thought about her mother and her older sister on the shore. She thought about the wonderful animals at the park where Papa worked. She wanted to work there too, one day, to play with the seals and brush the orcas' teeth. She prayed for all of them, family, friends, and animals, prayed they would be safe from the incomprehensible, alien thing bearing down on her, the monster that toppled cities and put fathers into trances and cut through ships. She prayed for those sharing her imminent fate, Papa, and Dr. Ishikawa, and that troublemaker Kenichi. She couldn't find it in her to blame Ken for the whole awful mess even though she really wished she hadn't gone along with him on his mischief today. She should have stayed ashore with Sis and Mama. She even prayed for The Voice, whoever or whatever it was, as she felt its resignation and sorrow. Only then did Helen pray for herself, and hoped beyond hope that the ocean wasn't too cold. Eyes still tightly shut, the girl heard a bloodcurdling scream. For a moment, she thought it was Ken's, or her own, or both of them. But Helen knew she wasn't screaming, and the noise she heard was no human scream—though it was faintly human-like. Nor was it coming from the boat. The scream seemed to emerge from everywhere and resounded all around her, making Helen's knees knock and teeth rattle. It was like a chorus of elephants bellowing in unanimous pain or rapture. It was filled with torment and rage, suggesting emotions beyond that of simple beasts. It made the air shimmer. The scream rose impossibly shrill in pitch before trailing off to a rumbling growl. It was the wail of a thousand millennia, the battle cry of angels, the voice of an avenging god. Helen's eyes would not open. Where moments before she had felt on her skin the spray of the frigid sea, Helen was now battered by hot, dry winds and the acrid smell of burning gasses. She suddenly felt the heavy wrench of gravity, like she was in an elevator rising way too fast. Helen finally opened her eyes against the wind and smoke, barely, but kept them low. She was still in the boat, with Ken and their unconscious fathers. Ken was in tears as the smoke was finally cleared away by rushing winds. He was pointing up, past her, over her right shoulder. \"Gah…\" Ken stammered. \"Gam…\" Helen turned to look toward where the boy was pointing. It was the eye she took in first, a great, wary, human-like eye, its pupil moving back and forth. The bearer of that eye scrutinized Helen and gazed beyond her at the same time, assessing the sky it soared through. Even from a distance she judged to be several meters, Helen knew the eye was many times bigger than her, and it seemed to possess an intelligence unlike any animal's. She beheld the creature's colossal reptilian head in profile—its discerning eye was positioned above a maw crowded with thick, crocodilian fangs. It had terrible upward pointing tusks, each as big as a truck and probably capable of piercing one, situated where the corners of its mouth met its scaly cheeks. Helen could barely make out the rest of the monster's armored vastness. It was not unlike a kame , as the Japanese called similar creatures, pronounced very like \"gahm-eh.\" A giant turtle, clearly intelligent, a turtle with teeth, and a turtle that flew, propelled by great jets of flame trailing from the posterior of its shell. Not a turtle, then. Gamera. Kenichi had called it Gamera. Gamera shrieked again. The unforgettable, primordial sound popped both Helen's ears and echoed in her skull, drowning out the terrified, alien chatter of The Voice. She was no longer afraid, though, or even concerned. Less than an hour before, Kenichi had tried to explain that this awesome being was a friend to children—and to all humanity. Helen did not want to hear it, she could not believe it of such a frightening monster. While she would spend the rest of her life wondering what Gamera was and where it came from, Helen would always regret her initial reaction—her hope to never see it again. She was glad Gamera answered her prayers, anyway. She believed now in its benevolence, and would always believe. Looking back over twenty-five years, Dr. Helen Wallace never felt as safe as she did at that pivotal moment—she a little girl, taken aloft and away from peril in the palm of Gamera's mighty hand.[Chapter 2] \" There is One that inhabits the place of utter cold, and One that respireth where none other may draw breath. In the days to come He shall issue forth among the isles and cities of men, and shall bring with Him as a white doom the wind that slumbereth in his dwelling .\" ~ The prophet Lith, from the Parchments of Pnom (Clark Ashton Smith, \"The Coming of the White Worm\") Lincoln Sea, northwest of Greenland, 1980 Here is where it began , it thought. Gamera returned to the wintry barrens, where nearby it was awakened fifteen revolutions of this world around its star prior. Its accidental release from its icy entombment was not, in fact, the \"beginning\" of which its wandering thoughts had turned. Gamera's memory encompassed vast ages before recorded history, when the past was accounted for and subsequently forgotten, when the very ability to understand the passage of time was gleaned, lost, and recovered only tens of thousands of years later. It was so very old. Indeed, Gamera, under different names to divergent cultures, wherever a notion of its activities and image survived—stained with primitive dyes on cavern walls, given celestial distinction in the star charts of the first astrologers, accorded the burden of the world itself upon its back in the songs of the medicine lodges—was a symbol of longevity itself. This is where Gamera was born—or made—and where it would be lost for so many eons. The dragon turtle recalled that before the shifting of the poles this frozen wasteland was verdant—a place where the waning gods of Eld had walked among that era's human analogues and prepared them for the dangers posed by the quiescent, primordial evils. In those days, the line between humanity and divinity was thin—mortals dwelt nigh as the gods themselves and venerated the greatest of them as their regents. Those golden days were filled with learning and pleasure—summer was eternal, sustenance was plentiful, and humanity's dreams were made extant by means of sorcery and super-science. The Eld and their disciples were higher beings, and they created marvels that the debased hominids of the modern age would only tremble at the sight of, alchemical and theurgical wonders humanity today could scarcely comprehend. Gamera knew first hand, for it was among those very wonders. It had certainly invoked in contemporary humans far more than trembling throughout the duration of its return—tearful supplication on occasion and, too often, breech-wetting fear. Gamera could not fault the naked apes who had inherited the earth too much for their alarm. It was, after all, designed to be a warrior and a terror, a defender against the chaos spawn of distant stars, a soldier against the primeval lurkers of the blackened depths, a predator of the odious prowlers of the spaces between spaces. The Black Guardian of the North had finally restored itself to its full height of 80 meters. The edges of its bio-metallic carapace had sharpened into serrations. The talons of Gamera's scaly hands had lengthened exponentially to better rend the sickening flesh of its colossal foes. Though its ancient reputation had survived the ages in the form of diluted legends and myths, and its commitment to hunt down and destroy the emergent Old Ones remained as true as it had been in long lost Hyperborea—humanity continued to fear and oppose Gamera. If it were not for two characteristics existent in modern mortals, Gamera would hardly regret the furious rampage that it carried out immediately following its awakening. An atomic accident had forced the super monster from its dreamless slumber and its first impression was that of a degenerate, corruptible mankind, a pathetic race far removed from its nigh-divine antecedents. This was a people, Gamera reasoned, upon the precipice of its own damnation. It could smell the influence of the Old Ones upon them—these creatures akin to the savage, simian folk of its antediluvian birthplace; who made gory offerings to Cthulhu and Tsathoggua in benighted enclaves on the fringes of grand Commoriom. While they were clearly, albeit distantly, descended from the Eld and their mortal attendants of lost Hyperborea, Mu, Kantapuranam, and Alanhati—the passage of time, and perhaps, indiscriminate breeding with more degenerate anthropoids had debased humanity beyond salvation. Or so it thought. For during its war against them Gamera was exposed to the innocence of mankind's children, and the indomitability of the human spirit. The former, in the shape of a fearless, awe-struck child, had captivated the enraged creature, briefly assuaging it. A mere child had understood Gamera, had instinctively recognized the righteousness of its purpose. Though the rampaging monster had indirectly endangered the young boy in the first place, it decided to spare him. Gamera would spend several days contemplating the meaning of this encounter before ultimately, grimly resigning itself to its original course of extermination. The human spirit, on the other hand, ultimately defeated it, much to Gamera's astonishment. Rather than face their extinction as the decadent, inherently selfish primate vermin it had mistook them for, mankind rallied together, pooled their greatest technologies, and—while they could not, could never , destroy it—they managed to banish Gamera from the very planet it was designed to protect. Mere men had defeated a near-god! When Gamera returned to earth, after a brief period of reflection, it was still angry, yes, but amenable to the idea that there was a purpose to its accidental release from its icy prison beyond that of humanity's total destruction. When a corrupted lesser Old One from the island remnants of Mu began its own terrible predation upon human civilization, Gamera's alternate suspicions were confirmed. The stars were right. The Old Ones were awakening. Gamera would don his ancient mantle of defender, if not for mankind as it had become, but for humanity's future, for the spark of divinity it retained in the form of its children. And so it was. Gamera's toils were nearly ceaseless for several years. Its foes were mostly the less significant banes of the ancients, though even these battles were compounded in difficulty by the frustrating quality of humans to get in the way . Yet on some occasions the great guardian might have met its end if not for timely human intervention. The draconic doom of sunken Mu, Barugon, was unleashed upon Osaka and only defeated after Gamera learned from humans of the sickly creature's aversion to water. The blight of Alanhati, the vampiric god-avian Gyaos, was severely weakened by the same mortal ingenuity that vexed Gamera two years prior. An invasion from planet Vhoorl was thwarted when two children the aliens were using as hostages managed to break Gamera free from the Great Old One's mental domination. When human negligence was responsible for removing the Elder eidolon imprisoning the formidable Devil Beast Jiger, the Old One managed to infect the monster turtle with its parasitic progeny. Gamera was only wrenched from the jaws of defeat after a pair of brave boys relieved it of this cancerous infection. Certainly, humanity still feared it and continued to misunderstand its intentions. The militaries of the world still put themselves in harm's way more often than not when Gamera clearly was their last, best hope against some rampaging entity. While they would find its mind difficult to comprehend, Gamera often lamented the loss of humankind's telepathy—which at least permitted for some rudimentary communication between them. Perhaps this was for the best, as it allowed the grim protector to ignore the few bystanders remaining underfoot when duty called it into population centers. If the past few years had any wisdom to engrave into its ancient, nigh-immortal mind, it was that there was too high a price for Gamera's compassion. Were it not for empathy, the monster could have sacrificed the Vhoorls' two young hostages and prevented the destruction it was subsequently coerced into. Gamera should have immolated the archeologists at the Wester Island dig site rather than allow them to release the Devil Beast Jiger, who would go on to harm thousands of innocents. In the near future, Gamera considered, it would express far less sentimentality when it was working. From now until the turning of the age, when the Great Old Ones were quiescent once again, the Black Tortoise would be focused and pragmatic. It was an agent of primordial forces, it had a job to do, and that job was cosmic in scope. It'd sacrifice hundreds of lives to preserve a thousand. It would incinerate a thousand, children and otherwise, to salvage a million—its \"Friend to All Children\" epithet notwithstanding. Gamera would try, at least. Humanity's survival into the next golden age counted upon it, monstrous creation of the vanished Elder Gods, whether or not they knew or appreciated it. --- This night, however, the only bystanders near the vicinity of Gamera's target destination were the seals, the white bears that hunted them, the spiral horned narwhals that swam lazily in the saline depths beneath the sheets of ice covering the sea's surface—and Charles Crawley, CEO and chairman of Alrayn-Crawley Financial. Crawley gazed over the ice-covered railing of the Blæst Gående oil platform, derelict as of a few minutes ago, to take in the desolate vastness of the frozen sea, lit only by the stars, a sliver of moon, and the aurora borealis. Standing over two meters tall, bald and ebony-skinned, and dressed only in a black business suit to warm him against the wind-struck, sub-zero temperatures of his surroundings, Crawley cut an imposing, shadowy outline diametrically opposed to the whiteness of the landscape. Sharing the bleak pallor of the arctic barrens was the oil platform itself, now laying askew at a forty degree slant, its steely-gray railings and walkways, asphalt decks, and concrete towers completely enveloped in a crystalline sheen of blue-white ice. One might mistake the super-structure as having been abandoned for years, were it not for the presence of the corpses—dozens or perhaps hundreds of men lying, bent over, kneeling or standing upright in stiff, rigid postures. The recently deceased workmen resembled porcelain effigies, their flesh and clothing rendered blue-white by the sudden preternatural cold that blasted them and lingered still. Upon each face was frozen a rictus of sheer terror or a grimace of agony, blue-lipped mouths agape revealing broken teeth—shattered from final living moments spent chattering uncontrollably. Charles Crawley paid the dead no mind, nor bemoaned the loss of the expensive platform, which he owned via a ACF subsidiary known as Peripheral Petroleum. The project had served its purpose. There was no further need to compensate the Danish crown for the rights to siphon the black crude from an undersea mountain whose peak reached a few dozen feet below sea level. Crawley knew in the long term the sludge mined here was no oil, and would probably prove unviable as an energy source. At the moment it was stored in reserve in massive Peripheral facilities across the globe. For a rainy day, Crawley mused. In any case, the sable stew needed to be drained away, like contaminated blood during a transfusion. For that is what it was indeed—blood. The financing, construction, and maintenance of Blæst Gående was a massive operation, in a very literal sense. Several kilometers to the north, yet perceptible to the mogul's keen senses, was the enormous architect of the platform's upending, and the cause of the deadly, preternatural frost upon the workmen that no normal flame could thaw. Its flesh was pasty-white like that of a beached, rotting squid. Its shape was bloated and serpentine, externally segmented every few meters by ringed rims like the annuli of a worm. The entity rolled and slid itself like a sidewinder across the sheets of ice. As it stretched and contorted, it was difficult to determine the thing's total length, but Crawley judged its average at about 350 meters. Its thickness spanned about 45-50 meters at its most swollen point a quarter of the way down its length from its head. Crawley knew not where the creature intended to go, nor did he care, though he suspected it sought a new iceberg in which to make its mobile lair—as its notorious domicile had been affixed to the sea floor for a thousand generations. The Old One and its recently abandoned home, Yikilth , were known to Crawley through rare occult texts such as the Book of Eibon , an ancient memoir that had survived the eons to offer a glimpse of life and magic in lost Hyperborea. Rlim Shaikorth , the creature was called, and it once traversed the northern seas in its glacial citadel, assailing ships and ports with a lethal cold for reasons no mortal could fathom. Twenty or so millennia ago, the White Worm was feared and worshipped as a god. The creature suddenly broke its rapid stride and coiled itself like some vulgar mockery of a rattlesnake. It turned its flattened disk-like face toward the southeast. Crawley beheld the monster's pale, gaping mouth and sunken, crimson eyes—which looked more like bleeding, abscessed sores than apparati for seeing. Crawley didn't need turn to know what approached—he knew well what was powerful enough to give a Great Old One pause. \"Rlim Shaikorth,\" Crawley called, \"the enemy cometh.\" The entrepreneur's voice was deeply resonant, deliberate, and pleasant. It betrayed a trace of African inflection, though if any person was around to hear Crawley speak, they would be very hard pressed to determine the precise origins of his accent. Crawley shouted: \"Freeze this wretched spawn of the Eld to its bones! Return it to a hibernation to outlast the eons, lest it persist in thwarting the rightful return of your fellows. For once you did in ages past, so you must do again!\" The echoic, shrill hum of Gamera's rotary flight amplified to a ear-splitting clamor as it passed over the ruined oil platform. Four blue jets of ionized flame emanated from the chelonian monster's leg and arm cavities, each curving as it spun like a flaming shuriken toward the White Worm. Great trails of exhaust, tendrils of smoke intertwining into dissipating braids, followed in the wake of the whirling shell. Suddenly, Gamera extinguished two of its thrusters and presented its forelimbs and head. As if in answer to Crawley's threats on the Old One's behalf, Gamera shrieked a roar of its own—that iconic elephantine battle cry which made titans quake. It surged toward coiling Rlim Shaikorth on the awesome power of its rear rockets alone. Forearms extended outward to level its flying charge, Gamera gulped back its reptilian head. Waddled throat orange and aglow, the Guardian of the North opened its tusked jaws and eructed. Rlim Shaikorth barely flinched as Gamera unleashed a volley of plasma fireballs toward it. The flying colossus veered to the White Worm's left and upward. The nighttime landscape, previously green and blue lit by the blazing aurora, flashed reddish-orange in the seconds between the fireballs' discharge and impact. Crawley, having studied the monster do-gooder for years, knew that Gamera's magnetoplasmic fireballs burned hotter than a solar flare. Few beings in the cosmos could feel the bite of those flames and not blister, though the effect was usually, terminally worse. Rlim Shaikorth was courting its own demise by just sitting there and staring with its stupid, red globular eyes at the incoming missiles. For a moment, the Old One reminded Crawley of a cobra charmed by a flautist in a Middle Eastern bazaar, or a deer on the highway transfixed by the headlights of an approaching truck. Perhaps, mused Crawley, Rlim Shaikorth was disoriented by his recent awakening. Or perhaps it never was a terror equal to the reputation ascribed it in the codices of the ancients. Crawley half-expected an explosion of ionic fire, black blood, and charred wormish flesh. What he saw instead were three fireballs vanish into smoky wisps within a few meters of Rlim Shaikorth's corkscrewed bulk. Aha ! thought the chairman, the White Worm protects itself with a field of absolute zero cold. Not even Gamera's flames can burn at that temperature! The serpentine abomination uncoiled, slithered aside, and turned its head northward where Gamera was coming in for another aerial approach. This time, the monster turtle attempted a strafing run with its continuous \"tongue\" of superheated plasma. While it carved a deep steaming trench in the polar ice toward its annelid foe, Gamera's tongue of fire arched up and over Rlim Shaikorth's body before continuing on behind it, utterly failing to make contact with the Old One's flesh. Charles Crawley laughed heartily. Again Gamera screeched, a roar of frustration that carried miles on the arctic winds. Unfortunately for the mysterious CEO, Gamera was intelligent enough to know that should it attempt to engage Rlim Shaikorth with fang and claw, its tissues, tough as they were, would quickly succumb to the cold that froze even molecules. Crawley amused himself momentarily with a mental picture of the reptilian behemoth flailing away at its foe while its frostbitten talons and snout broke apart amid gouts of green blood. In reality, the avatar of the Eld withdrew its head and forelimbs and reignited bluish flames from its arm cavities. Gamera resumed its saucer-like flight and wheeled toward its prey, likely gambling that its nigh-invulnerable, jagged-edged shell would protect it while severing the Old One in half. Suddenly, as if to say, my turn , the White Worm's wide, toothless maw shifted expression from shocked animal stupidity to a menacing sneer. The monster annelid made a sound like a backwards wail that accompanied its enormous intake of breath. A thick ring-like bulge took shape around the creature's body, halfway between its face and its bloated mid-segments. Rlim Shaikorth reared up like a striking cobra, revealing a sphincter-like orifice on its swelling clitellum. The pulsating, fleshy ring glowed with pallid light. As Gamera spun toward it, the thickened gland-sack of the White Worm deflated—expelling from the orifice an intense, monochrome helix of energy. The expanding cone of light caught the chelonian demigod dead on. Its propulsion fires died. A frost instantly congealed upon its bio-metallic shell. Dead spinning on inertia several kilometers toward the northwest, Gamera impacted and embedded itself three-quarters its width deep in an icy cliff. The landscape trembled with the shock of the enormous creature's crash. Rlim Shaikorth trumpeted its victory with more strange, backwards keening, nearly drowning out the noisome echo of the riven glacier. The frozen deck of the Blæst Gående was silent save for a whistle of wind, the slight groaning produced by the swaying of the platform's construction, and the self-satisfied cracking of Charles Crawley's knuckles.[Chapter 3] \" They found him, far out on the ice, torn to pieces, as is the way with those whom the spirits have punished for refusing to observe the customs of their forefathers. And the son, who was bound to the sledge, had not been touched, but he had died of fright .\" ~ Artuk, Who Did All Forbidden Things (Knud Rasmussen [compiler], \"Eskimo Folk-Tales\") Lincoln Sea, northwest of Greenland, 1980 Arluk struggled with the weight of the walrus's carcass. The ropes dug into his right shoulder and burned. Step by excruciating step, the hunter dragged the rickety sled behind him. The Inuit's wide, sealskin kamik crunched into a thin layer of snow that wafted idly across the sea ice. Sweat poured into his eyes, while an ice formed of snot and labored exhalations clung to his bushy whiskers. Arluk damned his aching muscles, the arthritic pains familiar to any man of late middle age. He should not have had to tackle a seal hunt alone, but nearly all left of the able-bodied Nakotiqa tribesmen had succumbed to sickness. The others had abandoned their territory long ago to seek work among the white man, vanishing into their cities and ships, forsaking the old ways—and the ways of Arluk's folk were older than most. Other Inuit tribes would also say \"stranger than most.\" Few had dealings with the inbred Nakotiqa, who were called, variously, in the inconsistent tongues of the Arctic folk \"those not like us.\" They were among the most remote tribes and dwelt the furthest north, roaming the ice bridging Greenland and Ellesmere Island, rarely journeying further south than the Robeson Channel. The persistence of the missionaries who discovered them during the Great War would subdue their most peculiar traditions, but even after converting to the white man's faith, Arluk's people remained alone. If the anthropologists of the day endeavored to pay the insular tribe more attention, they'd have discovered a fathomless heritage, older even than the extinct Tuniit folk who preceded the Inuit, as ancient as the stones and structures buried beneath kilometers of ice and just as unfamiliar to modern scholarship. The prehistoric Nakotiqa mingled with the giant Tuniit and later, the Eskimos as to make their own features and language nigh-indistinguishable from their Arctic neighbors. But a careful observer might note the golden cast to the flesh of a rare few of them, the curly Assyrian thickness of some of the men's beards, or the flowing tawny locks of their most coveted women. This theoretical onlooker, being most fortunate, might have chanced upon the unusual presence among the Nakotiqa of eyes tinted a muted emerald or grey, of which a bearer was born but once in many, many generations. If such notions ever occurred to Arluk, he paid them no heed. The hunter was a practical man, and jaded. Despite the badgering of his wife, he paid scant service to the prayers taught to his parents and grandparents by bullying missionaries. Likewise, he rarely heeded the rites crucial to placating the spirits and souls which every Nakotiqa knew to dwell in the land, the winds, and the animals. The quest for meat was Arluk's reality, and the walrus would provide so much of it, along with lamp oil, leather, and bone. Besides, the blubbery beast was already mortally wounded when the huntsman stumbled across it, by a bear that most likely limped away worse off than its intended prey. Let the bear worry about the walrus's spirit , thought Arluk. He had more realistic concerns, like how to haul the 1800 kilogram carcass home on a sleigh that was already uncertain to sustain the weight of a few seals. Even should he manage the load, Arluk would likely be very late in returning home, many hours into the darkest part of the night. A less stubborn man would have forsaken the task as impossible. Save for a sturdy steel knife, Arluk was unarmed, having broken his spear leveraging the walrus onto his sled. The hunter winced when he noticed the transport's right runner was bent at a slight outward angle beneath the weight of his impractical cargo. As he heaved and pulled, Arluk lamented the loss of the tribe's sled dogs, who over the past decade had run off starved; or were eaten themselves as times grew ever leaner and desperate for the Nakotiqa. The man remained undeterred, however. He was lucky indeed to find this prize and the snow was light enough that he only needed to keep the runners oiled to make sufficient progress back to the camp. It was but a few kilometers, and the impending night would be alight with the aurora. The lack of dogs, a broken spear, and the bent runner were mere setbacks. At least, they were minor concerns compared to the possibility that the bear might return—after licking its own wounds—to claim its wounded prey. A bear who likewise left limping tracks and a trail of blood droplets in the same general direction Arluk was headed. Halfway to the camp, the sea ice sloped upward, rising to the north. Arluk strove to remain south of the rise on relatively flat terrain. It was on the crest of the rise he caught site of the bear. While his heart seemed to creep up his throat, Arluk drew his knife. A year ago, the Inuit had traded a narwhal horn for the stainless steel blade, to one of the white roughnecks who worked on the oil rig a kilometer north of where he now stood rooted with shaky legs. The bear, for its part, reared awkwardly upon its hind legs, facing not the Inuit hunter and his corpulent burden, but away toward the foreigners' superstructure. For a few seconds, Arluk had thoughts that wavered between fending off what ought to be a severely wounded bear and running for his life. He decided, simply, to wait and see what his legs would do when the bear finally caught scent of the bloated pinniped's corpse. There was an impasse of several minutes in which Arluk waited for the giant white carnivore to turn its gaze away from the aurora-lit horizon, drop to all fours and charge down toward him. It never did, and the hunter soon realized it never would. He had never seen a bear stand on its hind legs for so long and remain motionless. Something was not right. Knife still drawn, Arluk left the sled and cautiously stomped up the crest to the immobile bear. As the rise steepened, the hunter was forced to lean into it for balance. Fortunately, the night was clear and the air still. The curious hunter pressed upward, cautious but no longer scared of the animal who stood as if stuffed and displayed in a white man's lodge. The lights of the blazing sky played across the hide of the bear, which the Inuit realized was sheathed in crystalline ice. Arluk dropped his knife. There was ilisiinneq on the wind—dark magic, darker spirits. The seasoned hunter finally followed the gaze of the frozen bear, whose expression showed nary a hint of the animal's legendary defiance or ferocity. Her wide eyes and snarling muzzle were petrified in something comparable to fright, as if the animal recognized a predator even more formidable than she. When he finally beheld the tilted ruin of the Blæst Gående rig, Arluk, a practical man, bowed and sang in the old tongue for the bear's spirit. He sang reluctantly for the men of the oil platform, too. Though he suspected them accountable for their fate, Arluk feared their lingering tupilaq were certain to frighten off the local game. Beyond the ruined oil platform, far to the north, far beyond the limit of the hunter's keen sight, tore a screech akin to a herd of besieged mammoths trumpeting in unison. It was a sound Arluk recognized and had not heard in 15 years. He ran toward his camp, leaving the dead walrus behind. --- It had been ages since another being touched its mind as Rlim Shaikorth did to Gamera now. Behold, Oh Kurmara! It had used an ancient variant of the super monster's name. Mine is the cold that extinguishes suns! Not the Black Guardian, nor any power in the cosmos will prevent the white death I unleash on this world. I am he who even the gods may not oppose! Gamera had been subject to both the White Worm's freezing helix and its insufferable boasting eons ago. Rlim Shaikorth was a connoisseur of the black wizards of lost Hyperborea, he pried from them a thousand secrets of the arcane before devouring them utterly—their flesh, their souls, and their eldritch essences. A side effect of the monster's insatiable appetites was to be infused with the tatters and scraps of its victims' personas. While the mind of an Old One was generally incomprehensible and alien, Rlim Shaikorth's was one of the few contaminated by the attitudes of humankind. It allowed the White Worm to make itself understood to mortals and mortal sympathizers like Gamera. In ages past, shortly after it had been the agent of Gamera's eons-long oblivion, the terrible annelid had inadvertently revealed to a mortal magician the source of its own undoing. Perhaps it would do so now, perhaps not. The guardian tortoise would not make the same mistake in either case—it had nothing it wanted to \"say\" to the Old One anyway. Its job was to execute it. Rlim Shaikorth crawled, stretching and contracting its segmented bulk toward the glacier into whose face its foe was embedded. A lipless, smiling maw bisected the flat disk of the White Worm's face, its crimson eyes, resembling globular blood clots, leaked gore as if they were tears. Has the Elds' pet truly fallen to the least of my abilities? it shouted directly into Gamera's mind, undecided whether or not the chelonian demigod had survived its attack. When Gamera did not stir, the Old One's telepathic soliloquy was aimed at nothing specific, save the land and the stars themselves. Hearken Forgotten Ones! Attend Ulthar and Hagarg Ryonis, if your sluggish minds yet pierce the Wall of Sleep! It is your progeny I have again vanquished! No longer have you a power in this world. I am healed, and will set upon your garden green a white death, an eternal frost wherever my light is cast! Gamera was trapped. It needed to protect its head and limbs from the White Worm, which were, save its left leg, incapable of reaching very far out of its shell, wedged as it was in the glacier. Worse, it needed to fuel and reignite its inner fire. While its arcane organs could harness electromagnetic waves enabling it to sense its prey or levitate, their main function was to ionize Gamera's flames, providing its jet propulsion and devastating weaponry. Rlim Shaikorth coiled and from the tip of its tail extended a thin, whip-like tentacle. As the Old One gurgled a susurrus hauntingly reminiscent of crude words, the extracted appendage writhed and traced a symbol in the frigid night air. A glyph formed, black and yet somehow brilliant, suspended as if branded into the flesh of space. The abominable annelid culminated its echoing chant with a noisome keen comparable to an eagle inhaling a hurricane. As the White Worm's voice trailed and the blasphemous symbol dissipated, the mountain of ice in which Gamera was embedded began to shake, then slowly collapse in on itself. The glacier had come alive and was slurping down the shelled morsel in its lips, not stopping until it had seemingly sucked in its own face as well. When the Black Guardian was wholly enveloped, the icy cliff sealed its fracture of a mouth and then rumbled rhythmically, as if chewing. Gamera felt the crush of the ice mountain even through its bio-metallic shell. The masticating glacier formed sharp interior teeth which bit down upon, but failed to pierce, its carapace. On its underside, however, the icy fangs relentlessly drilled at the turtle-like monster's more vulnerable plastron, and gouged their way through. Before its internal processes broke down and its supernatural abilities failed, the super monster felt Rlim Shaikorth turn dismissively and wriggle away to the south, and its own green life's blood pour down into whatever crevices the glacier retained. --- Arluk, exhausted from his run across the bleak vastness, reached the edge of the Nakotiqa camp and collapsed. As his startled tribesfolk gathered around his prostate form, the hunter muttered, \" ilisiinneq on the air! The Devil's envoy! We must leave!\" Believing him possessed, they brought him to the igloo of Oogroq, the nomads' chief. Amid a flurry of questions and suspicions, Oogroq sent the agitated tribesfolk away and tended to the feverish hunter. As he chanted magical words of healing, the old man prepared a fire and a cauldron of herbs. Scented smoke swirled into a small hole in the dome's ceiling. The flames crackled and cast their dancing light on the interior of the headman's snow house. Revealed within were the tanned hides of caribou and muskoxen, thoroughly covered with curvilinear sigils and crude figures in red dye. Lengths of driftwood and pieces of bone were similarly etched. The Nakotiqa chief, who also fulfilled the role of angakkuq , or shaman, kept woven baskets of effects, the contents of which his people ascribed a range of inscrutable origins and uses. While the Nakotiqa had converted to the white man's savior generations ago—even their wrinkled headman bore a crucifix—none were wholly divorced from their ancestors' beliefs. The continuation of Arluk's ramblings preceded the opening of his eyes. Oogroq took stock of the hunter's delirious words as he gradually coaxed his patient to consciousness. \"And the Devil's envoy returns…\" groaned Arluk before he sat up, eyes widened, in a cold sweat. \"You have heard the voice of the Destroyer,\" charged Oogroq, who jabbed his long, bony finger to Arluk's bare chest—just above the middle-aged Inuit's pale, spearhead-shaped birthmark. The hunter, now fully cognizant, took quick stock of his surroundings. He lay upon the igloo's raised sleeping area, which was covered in furs. The headman, Arluk noticed, was now garbed in the archaic trappings of an angakkuq . Though he hadn't cast aside his crucifix, Oogroq had covered his craggy face with red glyphs, had wrapped his arms and throat with entwined fetishes of bone and soapstone, and gripped an inscribed whalebone rod. Over his shoulders the aged shaman had draped a yellowing white pelt. The dead creature's scalp and upper jaw formed a hood, and Arluk gaped with revulsion at its deformity. Its curved fangs were far crueler than a bear's. Affixed to the fore of the animal's oversized crown was what resembled a narwhal's spiraling tooth. The cape further betrayed the seemingly non-ursine origins of the hide, for dangling at its edges were strips of what were once six, not four, clawed legs. Arluk had seen the cloak before when he was a younger man, 25 years or so ago. Oogroq had donned it when allaying a curse upon the military men who drove the Nakotiqa off one of their territories so a great weather and radar station could be built. The curse didn't work, of course, and the skeptical Arluk dismissed the mantle, repellent as it was, as a clever product of taxidermy, or the skin of mutant warped by the white man's poisons. Long had the no-nonsense hunter regarded the labors of the angakkuq as so much sleight-of-hand and trickery. For now, though, it was hard to dismiss the old man. Arluk was speechless as the shaman stood over him, showing in a crazed smile teeth which contrasted Oogroq's painted face. \"Answer, you idiot!\" shrieked Oogroq. His voice sounded like a wheezing muskox. \"I want to go to my wife,\" answered Arluk, \"and we need to leave this place. All of us\" The hunter attempted to rise from the shaman's bed of furs. Falling back on his elbows, he said, \"to the north, I heard its cry! It sounded like…\" \"Ssshhh,\" hissed the angakkuq , who waved his arms and clutched his crucifix. The beads and charms about him clinked and rattled. \"Say not its name, fool! You would give it power or bring it upon us.\" \"It toppled the fortress of the oil men,\" Arluk calmly replied. \"It is already upon us.\" The Nakotiqa headman seemed to consider this for a moment, then glowered at Arluk. \"You don't know anything,\" he said, prodding Arluk with his finger to accentuate each syllable. \"Do you remember when the foreigners came to us, fifteen years ago, and what they wanted of us?\" \"I do. And the consequences,\" recalled Arluk, \"the white fire, and those caught near it left shadows of ash. What that foreigner wanted of us was absurd, that is, until…\" \"Until you saw IT with your own stupid eyes! Ha ha ha!\" cackled Oogroq before a coughing fit struck him. This time it was the shaman's turn to lie down, as Arluk, summoning his strength, stood and embraced the ailing old man. The hunter gently lowered the costumed angakkuq to the bed of furs while Oogroq repaid him with several raps of the whalebone wand to Arluk's shoulders and back. \"I am… FINE,\" rasped the shaman. Blood dribbled from his mouth down his chin. \"Father,\" pleaded Arluk, \"please rest while I make us ready to leave. The old magic won't do us any good now.\" Oogroq lay on his back, betraying his human frailty and sickness for all the fearsomeness of his garb. He smacked his son again with the wand, this time just below the knee. As the hunter yelped in pain and lost his balance, Oogroq said, \"I am still the chief, boy! And you will do as I ask. You have said our gods dance to a new tune? Know that the song surges from the throats of the eldest chorus.\" The shaman muttered a word of power and gestured with the whalebone rod. \"What…\" was all Arluk managed to come back with before he felt a fog upon his mind and a great weight upon his shoulders. His smarting leg, where his father had struck him, felt as if its bones were made of broken glass. Arluk dared not stand, and the chief's words formed vivid pictures in the mist before his eyes. \"Know my son, what you have ever suspected,\" intoned the old man in the commanding voice of the man he was so many decades ago, \"that once Kalaallit Nunaat was blanketed in warm forests, and the foreigner who named it Grænland did so not, as the tale holds, because he wanted to lure settlers, but because he dreamt of its distant past. Maybe the Old Ones who yet sleep in the black gulfs below the ice reached him in dreams, I know not. \"Upon this once green land trod a race of gold giants, who, owing to their sorcery, we might as well call gods. Among them lurked our ancestors, who had migrated southwest from dying Lomar at the world's scalp. The gold giants built great cities and wielded powerful charms against the monsters of the depths. But even they, mere generations removed from the divinities who stole unto the earth, even they needed the secret names to work their magic! \"In Lomar, we had been chosen by the Great Spirits to learn the Nakotiqa for which we are named. These teachings encompass the breadth of time—from the blind chaos that spawned the world to the silent void that will someday swallow souls and stars—and countless eras between. In exchange we allowed the Great Spirits to borrow our skins, as their own forms were but thoughts. \"While the giants of this new land trod upon us and enslaved us, treated us as beasts—they begged for our wisdom out the corners of their mouths. We would not give up every secret; the starry lore of Yith and Yuggoth , the snake people, the Shan wasps and the primal shapers on the other side of the earth. Their mysteries we kept. The forbidden names we did share. Though I will not repeat them now, they are known by such epithets as 'Sleeper of N'kai ,' 'The Thousand Eyes,' 'The Source of Uncleanliness,' 'The Spider God,' and more besides. There was a price for our help, and in time we became the giants' masters! We took some of the golden ones as consorts and others we seduced to our forms of worship. After the patchwork offspring of the Lier-in-Wait fell in battle, it was by our discretion that the children of the Eld kept the Old Ones at peace. It was truly a golden age. \"But all ages turn, and the day came when the world upended, and the ice devoured the forests and cities of Kalaallit Nunaat . The golden giants who'd not mixed with us escaped to the sea. Many folk have come and gone from this land since. But we of the Nakotiqa remain, to keep the peace with Those Below, to use the wisdom of the Great Spirits. Do you understand?\" Arluk nodded, as the fog lifted from his mind and blood circulated once again in his bruised leg. Then Oogroq continued, \"the end is nigh, and we have one last thing to do. Those of us who have remained here through the ages, who have resisted the temptations of the white man's world, we're worthy of joining the Great Spirits. The Destroyer and the Guardian, Fire and Ice, fight at the age's end, for our destiny. But the outcome is in doubt. Among the prophesies is one that says there, here, a savior will arise to tip the balance. One that bears a mark like a grey flame!\" Oogroq drew himself up with inexplicable vigor and again prodded his son's bare chest. A subtle white aura seemed to envelope the bent old angakkuk. Arluk, astonished, felt as if every breath had flown from his lungs. The de-pigmented, spearhead shaped blotch on his chest could indeed be seen as a flame. \"What are we to do?\" asked Arluk to the shaman, when again he found his voice. The hunter gazed pensively out the igloo's clear ice window. Though it was deadest night, and had begun to snow, the tribe loitered about awaiting word of Arluk's condition, or an explanation for what had horrified him so. The shaman glared daggers at his son, and with some sadness, as if he expected the hunter to know the obvious answer to his own question. Arluk looked inwardly, touched the birthmark over his heart, and found that he did. --- Gamera was familiar with the sensation of swimming in a soup of its own green gore. While its instinct was to sleep, the Black Tortoise did not have much time. If it indulged in its regenerative hibernation now, it would lose the opportunity to escape its icy prison. It will have failed in the same manner, against the same opponent, as it had untold eons ago. Gamera could not leave its reemergence to chance, much less the caprice of its human \"allies\" who were just as likely to prefer it entombed, reemergence of the Old Ones notwithstanding. Gamera fell long ago in an age of powerful sorcerer-scientists, knowledgeable scholar-priests, and exalted god-kings. They understood the delicate foundation upon which their dominion lay. They recognized the enemy, and knew well their signs and omens. They mastered the rites that the Eld designed to keep the embattled Old Ones quiescent. The debased mortals of the modern age were ill-equipped for the cosmic storm on the horizon. The stars were right—diabolic, mind-blasting forces were in motion, tearing down the ramparts of the cosmos, ushering in an eternal, abominable night to supersede the dawn of a new, golden age for humankind. Gamera knew it was their last hope. Gamera felt pain like a mortal organism, a characteristic its architects believed would make it a more conscious warrior. Its reaction to pain, however, was not like a biological creature. It had a limited capacity to suffer. Pain was a signal to the monster's brain to be cautious, but it did not cringe from its wounds. Nothing short of nigh-total bodily annihilation would force the demigod to shut down and sleep, though it was normally strategic to do so before then. In the state it was in, most of its supernal organs were defunct. Damaged as they were, Gamera could not hope to influence the world's electromagnetic energies—it could not levitate, generate heat, produce fire or plasma, nor could it sense the locality of its enemies. Gamera's effectiveness as a warrior was limited. All the Black Guardian could do was bleed. Considering the nature of its prison, that might be enough. A green slush had formed beneath Gamera's broken body. The dark magic of Rlim Shaikorth had faded and the glacier had reverted to its normal, inanimate state. The reptilian goliath was suspended upside-down. Wracked with pain, the crippled demigod extended its right forearm, barely forcing it through its warped limb cavity. Gamera's razor-sharp talon finally touched the point where the edges of its wrecked shell pressed up against the ice floor. It scratched, then clawed at the blood-softened ice beneath it. Before long, it had excavated enough to manipulate its right claw outside its shell. Time passed, and eventually Gamera was able to orient its entire body downward, bringing both claws into play. Then its head emerged, enabling it to gnaw at the deepening floor. As it dug, Gamera's warm blood discovered new cracks to flow into, further weakening the ice. The monster turtle persisted like this, following the green rivulets into the nadir of the glacier and, finally, beyond. When it broke under the ice cap, Gamera felt cool, briny water flow around it. The Black Guardian of the North allowed itself to sink to the sea floor and succumbed to sleep.[Chapter 4] \" In the time of my grandsires had the Ice whelmed Polarion; in the days of my father Mu Thulan had been lost to men; and now (say the hardy travelers who had dared risk the wrath of the Cold Ones, those white spirits of the ice, or their dread Master, the abnormality: Rlim Shaikorth), even the spires of sunny Varaad are sheathed in sparkling frost, and the jungles wither, blasted by the cold .\" ~ Athlok, from a translation of Fragment MXI of the Pnakotic Manuscripts (Lin Carter, \"The Acolyte of the Flame\") Lincoln Sea, northwest of Greenland, 1980 \"Looks like a huge worm's made its appearance, Sir,\" chirped the voice of Captain Matt Church, informally known to his flight mates as Deacon. \"Cut the jokes, Harpoon Three,\" chided Major Caleb Travares, using his flight lieutenant's operational designation. \"This isn't an exercise.\" During engagements, Travares was Harpoon One, leader of renowned 466 Intercept Squadron—nicknamed Harpoon Squadron—part of AIRCOM's 11 Wing Polaris based outside Yellowknife. The Harpoons flew CF-104s, deadly supersonic jets nicknamed \"Widowmakers\" in perfect formation over the craggy Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Harpoons Two, Four, and Five, were known respectively as Fisher (an outdoorsman), Solo (a sci-fi buff), and Bowler (because of his favorite hat). Travares deflected his flight mate's continuous attempts to stick him with a handle. Since he once flew a CF101 Voodoo, Deacon shamelessly tried to get people to call the Major \"Papa Doc.\" Deacon thought it was clever while the rest of the squadron thought it was racist. Travares, a man of Dominican descent, was simply not in favor of being associated with the infamous Haitian dictator. \"Come on Doc,\" whined Deacon, \"you can't believe the Alert guys. Most of those shoes ain't seen the sun in weeks. They're stir-crazy.\" Deacon was referring to a call issued from Canadian Forces Station Alert, a communications and signal intercept station just over 800 kilometers from the North Pole. A few hours earlier, CFS Alert caught an S.O.S from Greenland's Blæst Gående oil platform. That distress call was suddenly silenced—though they did pick up a suspicious, encrypted mobile phone signal about fifteen minutes later. Alert had sent a helicopter to investigate and the crew reported that the rig appeared derelict. Approaching close to ground, the helo crew discovered the workmen's bodies, then became frantic. The last communiqués CFS Alert picked up from the panic-stricken recon team were \"ghosts in the snow,\" \"frozen bodies,\" \"bio-anomaly,\" and, yes, \"giant worm.\" Later, Alert's radar picked up a massive, unidentified object within 21 kilometers and closing—moving across the polar ice at a pace comparable to the cruising speed of a heavy tank. Further, the object gave out some bizarre signal noise. The Harpoons, the closest interceptors, were given the order to \"kick the tires and light the fires\" and scrambled out of Yellowknife. Years ago, Canada and the US would have had more planes in the air in the Arctic Circle. While the USSR still posed a threat to North America, the Cold War seemed to be waning, or at least seemed less likely these days to be decided by air jockeys and their lawn darts. Travares radioed back to base that his guys were flying low, as commanded, at \"cherubs three.\" Despite the falling snow the Major reported, \"we should have visual of the unidentified object in under a minute.\" The squadron resented this assignment, especially the uncomfortable anti-exposure gear they all had to wear—but all were intensely curious. Nearly every pilot had a \"friend of a friend,\" ostensibly stationed in the Far East, who'd engaged something whose appearance and proportions grew ever more terrible as the story circulated. From the mid-Sixties to the beginning of the Seventies, weird tales of \"bio-anomalies,\" casually known as monsters and kaiju , were all the rage in the Asian media. In the West, the stories were debunked as a result of the so-called \"Guilong War;\" efforts by Communist China to disrupt Japan's extraordinary economic growth. Allegedly, while the U.S. was mired in Vietnam, China assailed Japan with destructive experimental weapons that incited mass hysteria. Many Japanese, influenced by the famous \"Gamera\" hoax of 1965 and their own superstitions, blamed \" kaiju \" for the disasters. But now in 1980, in Japan as anywhere else in the world, admitting a belief in monsters was to be dismissed as a crackpot. The Major agreed with the assessment. The fuzzy photographs, the always misplaced physical \"evidence,\" the tabloid interviews with daft eyewitnesses and sham scientists—none of it added up. Why did people believe in nonsense? mused Travares. Giant monsters. Voodoo. Little green men. Sasquatch. Ghosts… For a split second, the Major thought he saw a figure pressing up against the right side of his cockpit bubble. Obviously a hallucination , he thought. The pilot knew that the idea of a man outside the window 300 meters up at a thousand kilometers an hour was ridiculous. The man, as it appeared for the moment it existed in Travares' mind, was wearing a colorless Canadian Forces Info-Ops uniform. His bluish-white hands and face pushed against the glass panels as his body floated behind him, irrespective of the sheering winds and g-forces. After shaking off the phantom's afterimage, Travares commanded, \"eyes open Harpoons.\" \"Can't see anything in this goo, Doc\" grumbled Deacon, referring to the snowfall, \"giant worms or otherwise.\" \"That's it, Harpoon Three!\" yelled Travares, \"I've had it with your…\" The Major's reprimand was cut off by a sudden flash of white light at the flight's 9-o'clock, where Deacon was holding his place in the arrowhead formation. All the squadron's instruments told them the same thing—that Harpoon Three's lights just went out. Deacon's plane dropped like a stone and crashed onto the ice sheet with a dull thud. \"Deacon's bird should have lit up like Christmas, Major!\" stammered Solo, noting the lack of an explosion. Their fighters were heavily armed—all packed a formidable compliment of missiles. A shift in the wind parted the snow, and the Harpoons all caught the sight of an enormous, horrific face, a mere 80 to 100 meters below them. None had to guess that the impossible entity which they each bore witness was the source of the flash. Fisher made the \"I can't believe it\" whistle. Bowler yelped, and knew that if he survived this, his future nightmares would involve giant eyes resembling milky coagula. Solo shrieked, before stammering \"n-now there's an eleven pucker factor!\" The rest of the squadron knew that meant poor Solo had lost control in a manner that would make peeling off his flight suit nasty business. None of the Harpoons could blame him. On that particular scale, they were all pushing ten. Travares kept his head, tried to ignore the imaginary specter that reappeared on his Widowmaker's canopy, and commed base that they had engaged \"the anomaly.\" Procedurally, control would then leave the intercept to the flight's jurisdiction. The pilots needed to concentrate. They were already losing it. This time, however, was different. \"Harpoons,\" returned a calm, unfamiliar voice. \"This engagement is officially designated Top Secret. The nature of your target must not be discussed. Period. You will not be debriefed by anyone with less than a General's rank or Level Three Government Security Clearance. Good luck gentlemen. Control out.\" Each of the Harpoons thought the man sounded way too young to be giving them orders. Though the Harpoons crowded the channel with questions for their leader, all chatter was drowned out by the raging wail of the smiling, slug-like abomination that appeared and disappeared behind the billowing curtains of snow. To Travares, it suggested an ill-trained soprano recorded on a scratchy 45, played backwards on a stadium PA. What they could see of the landscape was just as disheartening—jagged ice forming treacherous crags and towering cliffs. The worm crept peristaltically through the canyons near sea level. \"Confirmed, the anomaly is headed to the ball,\" radioed Travares, \"the ball\" signifying Alert Station itself, designated thusly because of its distinctive, disco ball-like radomes. Meanwhile, the spirit he was stubbornly ignoring appeared to be climbing through the glass hatch, and was about halfway into the CF-104's cockpit. The flight managed to turn in formation, dropped their noses toward the slithering colossus, and began to unload their M61 Vulcan cannons. The revolving guns each blazed forth a fusillade of 20 millimeter explosive rounds. The screaming shells were powerful enough to saw off a mountaintop, and the fighter pilots could not imagine any organism, especially one as seemingly soft bodied as the monster worm, surviving their onslaught. Before impacting the sickly, semi-translucent flesh of the gore-weeping creature, the giant bullets passed through a wavering field of air surrounding it. Their molecular integrity seemingly undone, the shells shattered, dropped, or bounced harmlessly off the creature. \"Keep your heads guys,\" urged the Major to his squadron, as they lifted up and around again toward the entity. They'd try missiles now. \"Uglier looking things in the ocean. Nothing but a big…\" \"Orders, Major!\" reprimanded the mysterious voice on the radio. Travares wondered who this pencil-pusher was. The imaginary ghost in his cockpit crowded behind him and reached toward the controls. The instruments and panels frosted over and became nigh-unreadable. A blinker alerting the pilot to temperatures detrimental to the machinery and his life had come on. Travares noticed none of it. When the Major glanced over his shoulder, the spectral man in the Info-Ops jumpsuit scrunched its pallid face in a bestial scowl. What remained of his teeth were like thorns. \"So… cold,\" gasped the spirit. The White Worm carried on nonchalantly. It seemed it was no longer paying any mind to the renowned Harpoons. \"O-okay guys,\" managed Travares, swallowing his fear. \"Let's light this candle. Fox three at...\" \"N-no can do Major!,\" interrupted Solo, before he burst out laughing. \"Got stowaways with me!\" To Travares' horror, Solo ejected while his plane barrel-rolled toward Fisher. Fisher attempted to jink away as Solo's chair, cackling pilot yet strapped in, shot up into his jet's intake. For a split second, Fisher's turbines sputtered and struggled to grind up the gory mass. The delay prevented him from clearing the spinning path of Solo's out-of-control jet. Just before the explosive collision, the Major thought he saw two bluish-white figures in the open cockpit of what had been Solo's plane, each oblivious to the rushing air or the imminent crash. Both seemed to wear oil rigger coveralls. Travares' own uninvited copilot smiled as the fires of the collision reflected off him. It was as if the figure was made of ice and snow. The wraith suddenly turned its head toward him, widened its dead eyes, and sank its ruined teeth into Travares' shoulder. The uncanny chill he felt was like icy fingers fondling his internal organs. The pain in his shoulder, though, was as hideously plain as the gout of blood painting the inside of his CF-104's canopy. No longer able to pretend the phantom was imaginary, the Major launched his guided missiles in the general direction of the overgrown grub and ejected. His chair unfurled a parachute, and Travares was jerked back and dragged slowly away from the fray by the winds. Two missiles he loosed, but there was one explosion, far afield of the White Worm. The other just bounced off the leviathan without detonating. A dud perhaps, or neutralized by the shimmering air shielding the creature. His plane continued to cruise toward the north. It would come down sooner or later. Snow and distance was soon to spare him any further eyewitness to the disaster. The last thing the Major saw was Bowler making a beeline toward the enormous slug as it vermiculated through a narrow ice chasm. A barrage of missiles and explosive shells preceded the hellbent pilot. At first, it looked as if the suicide run would have little effect on the White Worm. The artillery appeared useless. Rather than a blaze of glory, plane and pilot quietly began to come apart upon contact with the monster annelid's invisible shield. Due perhaps to the heat of the concentrated barrage, or the aircraft's mass, the core of the jet managed to pierce through the shimmering cloak of air, colliding with the serpentine body of the entity. For a moment, the White Worm's expression registered surprise before it keened in pain. Its globular eyes erupted in crimson spews. Shockwaves from the bombardment boomed off the ice canyon's cliffs, which became further compromised when the thrashing creature smashed its colossal bulk against them. Travares saw the White Worm engulfed in an avalanche of icy shards, but its hideous, inverse wailing continued to carry over the frozen sea. It was slowed, Travares knew, not stopped. Bowler , thought the Major, why didn't you eject? God bless you, my friend. We CAN hurt that thing. He saluted. As the wind carried him from the monster's deafening cries, Travares tried to put the deaths of his comrades from his mind. Tears would just freeze on his face, but oh how they wanted to flow. Remember your training. Travares tried to think of something positive, and the last few minutes' calamity began to wither away from his consciousness. He found himself very glad for his anti-exposure gear. He wondered why he still felt so cold; remembered the suit breach and wound about his shoulder, which he stemmed with his hand. He had lost a lot of blood. How? He couldn't recall anymore. Have to patch that mess up when I land , he mused. Good thing the chair has a first aid kit. Travares thought that he might actually make it home alive. During the long trip down, the Major kept himself optimistic by thinking about his kids, their mom, and the tropical warmth of his father's beloved island. What he couldn't ignore, however, was the voice behind him. \"S-so… very… cold,\" it rasped. --- How much time had passed? A nigh-immortal, Gamera measured its existence by broad spans. It could sleep for what was to it a moment and new life-forms might have developed, fulfilling ecological niches forsaken by long extinct predecessors. The planet it was spawned to protect could face geological upheavals that seemed devastating from an epochal perspective, but were gradually adapted to by those whose perceptions were less farseeing. It had lived to witness seas boil and cool, continents form only to break apart and sink, species evolve and then disappear, distant suns brighten and wink out. Gamera, though, was designed to be conscious of what was, to its mind, microscopic moments in time. Without this awareness, it would have been difficult for the Black Guardian to regard humanity at all. Empires arose and fell for every thump of its massive heart—what would a human lifetime otherwise mean to such an ancient force? Its ability to focus upon infinitesimal fragments of time also served the reptilian demigod well in moments such as these. Gamera knew it could ill-afford more than a few hours rest, though its battered body demanded days. While it regenerated quickly in slumber, the dragon turtle awoke retaining severe damage to its bio-metallic shell. Gamera's carapace was a wreck. Its plastron was still horrifically perforated though it was no longer bleeding. The colossus's supernatural organs had reconstructed themselves, barely—they only possessed a limited functionality before which they would burst. Gamera swam in the manner of a freshwater turtle beneath the ice cap, seeking out an area thin enough for it to break through to the surface. It still needed to consume flame and combustible fuels to reignite its internal furnace. Gamera extended its senses, shifting its great human-like eyes back and forth. Rlim Shaikorth had stopped moving, but Gamera knew the Old One still lived. Perhaps the mortals had detected it and found some way to slow it down. There were no significant settlements this close to the pole; but the White Worm was headed to a base that harnessed radio waves. Gamera had passed over it on the way to battle, electromagnetically obfuscating its own presence as it did so. The station was sparsely inhabited. Should the champion of the Eld manage to obtain the fuel it needed from the ruined refinery, the mortals at the base could be saved. If it failed, the fires Gamera hungered for would instead need to be coaxed out of the base, its personnel, it judged, were an acceptable sacrifice. --- The fading Travares, still nestled in the ejection seat, jolted at the sound of muffled pounding and tremors. The Cold Ones lingered about him, now a quartet. In his semi-consciousness, they clawed at him, and the Major could vaguely feel their ghostly fingers across his flesh, sometimes upon his eyes, his heart, or brain. But their ability to become solid enough to harm him had its limits. The spirits resembled the White Worm's victims—two were dressed as oil riggers, another, the same one who followed him from his fighter jet, wore its familiar Info-Ops uniform. The last, in an AIRCOM flight suit, was Deacon, his once happy-go-lucky features contorted in agony. Physically, the wraiths seemed made of nothing more than granules of blue-white ice. Their forms, or parts of them, would randomly disperse and drift off just before they recomposed themselves. Despite their weightlessness, the Cold Ones did not seem to be at the mercy of the air, floating with or against the wind as they pleased. They could harden no more than bits of themselves, and then only through concentration. By gesturing with his ground flare and shouting, Travares was able, barely, to keep the ghosts from pulling apart the shreds of parachute bandaging his shoulder, biting him again, or clawing out his eyes. They still made it difficult for him to access the survival kit from its compartment on the ejection chair. The Major didn't have much time, survival kit or no. He was getting very sleepy, and once he dropped his flare, he knew the specters would rip him apart. Again the thud and a vibration. Travares had no idea if he was on solid ground or an ice sheet. Whether it was an earthquake or a whale trying to break itself a breathing hole didn't matter—he'd be dead soon. The Cold Ones weren't phased. Another great thump resounded from below and Travares lost his grip on the flare. He didn't feel as if he had the strength to unbind himself from the chair in order to reach it. The Major's fleeting energies were all but spent retrieving the flare in the first place and lighting it, then in reeling in the parachute and wrapping it around his bloody shoulder. The Cold Ones drifted toward him, their ravenous mouths open as if to feast. There was another great thud and the ground buckled. Travares' chair bounced up and landed on its side. All around him echoed the creaking and cracking of shifting ice. The snow-forged apparitions closed on him, but their path was suddenly obstructed by a great, white, hornlike object that stabbed up out of the ground. There were two—its twin had come up with it, a half dozen or so meters away. At last taken aback, the wraiths dissipated and reformed well away from the things. The dual protrusions ripped across the ice, remaining equilaterally distant as if they were attached to some infinitely larger thing below. Great water-filled rifts in the icecap formed in their wake as they swiveled and crushed. The giant tusks, for that is what to Travares they appeared to be, sank back into the sea. They left behind a swirling lake of broken ice, over a dozen meters in diameter. The quartet of Cold Ones circled around it, single-minded in their desire to eviscerate the stubbornly still-living pilot. Deacon was at their lead. Travares finally made a Herculean effort to free himself from the upended chair. \"Come on Deacon,\" said the battered Major, forcing a smile, \"Come on, man, you remember ol' Papa Doc, right? You can call me that if you want. Don't bother me a bit.\" \"So… cold…\" the phantom replied, \"so… hungry…\" Within two meters of his prostate body, the ghosts flowed in for the kill. But the helpless pilot was focused on the recently excavated lake behind them, and the monstrous, crocodilian claw that reached out from it. The mighty hand, clawed and scaled like a reptile yet bearing a human-like thumb, scooped up the oblivious Cold Ones and closed upon them. Can ghosts be crushed? wondered Travares, and decided that, yes, indeed they can! when he heard their hoarse voices cry out before fading away. And what is this thing burying its killing claw in the ice in front of me? What is this monster, hauling its bulk up through the portal it chewed, first its dragon head with boar tusks… Then the rest, its shell with saw-tooth edges widening the gap, breaking its way to the surface? It is huge! The thing howls, its voice sounds like a hundred trumpets out of tune. No way. It can't be. It crawls over, cautious to my presence, I'm a bug to it. It looks right at me, those intelligent eyes move back and forth. What does it want? --- Gamera, saltwater and ice cascading off its shell, climbed out of the sea on all fours. It then stood upright and bellowed again. It was wary of the dying human before it. The man seemed helpless, but the super monster knew that it might require his knowledge and his tiny hands. It expected the human to be grateful for eliminating the Cold Ones who besieged him. If only it could make the empathically blind mortal understand its desires… --- \"GAMERA! Holy $%! You're $%ing real!\" After the prosaic musing of his fevered mind, his mouth gave way to the colossal reality standing, godlike, over him. It was nearly impossible for Travares to do anything but curse. \"What other $%'s the government keeping quiet?\" he shouted, as if the giant turtle could answer. \"Santa Clause around here somewhere? $% orders. My kids aren't going to believe this $%.\" Giant worms and ghosts were one thing. A media phenomenon widely and aggressively written off as a hoax was another. Maybe too aggressively , considered the Major. Gamera dropped again to all fours and planted the hand that crushed the Cold Ones at Travares' side. He could feel its anomalous warmth. The turtle-like giant moved its head from side to side. Its pupils rolled and it grunted a cloud of steam. Travares was beginning to think the monster was waiting on him. Bolstered by the beast's body heat, the Major finished undoing the latches binding him to the chair. He lit another flare, and Gamera voiced a long, deep, reptilian growl. While accessing the first aid kit to dress his wound, Travares looked up and said, \"l-look, uh, not sure if you know English or if you can hear me, but are you here to kill that worm thing?\" Gamera glared down at him and grunted again, belching another cloud of steam. Travares stitched up his shoulder with a needle heated by the flare. \"Because,\" he managed to continue, \"it radiates absolute zero cold. But it's not airtight. If you concentrate heat or matter on one spot, the field fights to keep up.\" The dragon turtle regarded him, seemingly quizzically. \"O-okay, I, well… thanks,\" said Travares, opening another compartment under the ejection seat. \"I'm going to get my radio going, and I think the Americans are going to be here soon.\" The pilot imagined that it would not be long before another squadron arrived, probably from the Thule base in western Greenland. Or, at least, a search and rescue craft. As he struggled to activate the radio, the leviathan took the pilot up in his scaly hand and set him among the fore scutes of its carapace—just behind its neck. \"Hey!\" protested the Major, but Gamera was already lumbering on two legs toward Blæst Gående, quaking the ground with a determined tread. --- Of the Nakotiqa, all forty-three had set out from their campsite, abandoning it to the elements. The forsaken Inuit—mostly women, elders, the malformed and disabled, and a few young children—were clad in thick dark leathers trimmed with furs. Six near-skeletal muskoxen were loaded with their meager possessions, and a pair of mange-stricken elk drew a sleigh of trade goods. The somber throng, all who remained of a people who beheld the breadth and totality of time, who survived through a not-insignificant fraction of it, followed close the old angakkuq Oogroq and his son, now chief, Arluk. Thickly bearded Arluk, aged yet hale and heavily built, was draped in what had earlier been his father's mantle. The strange white hide of the mono-horned, bear-like beast, six clawed limbs fluttering in the breeze behind him, lent the hunter a regal, if savage air. It was Arluk who clutched the enchanted whalebone rod in his strong, mittened hands, having had it and the cloak presented to him before the tribe in a quick ceremony. It seemed to his people as if the hunter drew especial warmth from the hide or the wand. For despite the arctic chill, the new chief's downy chest was exposed to display his grey, flame-shaped nevus. Arluk showed no aversion to the cold, nor any of the cynicism that had previously characterized him—his deep-set eyes were reddened with purpose. The wizard Oogroq danced through the snow with an uncanny vigor, just behind his son. The old man had donned a fearsome mask. It was three times as long as the wearer's face and twice as wide, made of driftwood and trimmed with feathers and bones. Superficially, it resembled a human skull, albeit a hideously distorted one, as if it were stretched from its scalp and chin. The mask's face was bleached white and highlighted with faded blacks and blues, as was the plumage which haloed it. Within its blackened eye sockets were painted red stars. The angakkuq likewise wore a pair of oversized gloves, both were white and had elongated fingers as long as he was tall. Oogroq would break every now and then from his cavorting and the mask would appear to split open from a hinge located on the tip of the head. Behind the bisected skull was yet another, smaller face—a crude blue-grey starburst with eyes and a smile. When he opened the mask, Oogroq would look menacingly from side to side. Long gone from the old man's garb was the gold crucifix he wore for nearly half a century. This was a night for the spirits and the magic of old, and the white man's savior would proffer no succor. The procession ascended a great rise, a soaring plateau. They had traveled many kilometers upon the ice cap, but now land lay beneath their weary feet—albeit land encrusted in rime. None, save perhaps the shaman, had been to this hidden islet nor navigated the narrow path that coiled toward its zenith. After many woeful steps, the piteous people and their beasts arrived at the top, and were momentarily gladdened at the chance to rest—to touch the sky and to gaze out across the vastness. The children among them reached higher, tiny hands innocently hoping to scoop up the aurora in its liquid green-blue brilliance. But Arluk, with a poise befitting the Inuto lords of old, gestured further inland with the whalebone rod. The wand's inscriptions appeared to his followers' tired teary eyes as if they flickered and writhed. The tribe came to the lip of a caldera, and their final destination lay within a great, pitch-black crater. None could see the bottom through the shadows cast by the depression's inner walls, but it seemed far deeper down than their climb up. The new headman, showing nary a sign of fatigue, ordered his people along and reassured them that the journey was near its end. The prancing old wizard incanted in the secret tongue, and the weather-beaten Nakotiqa suddenly found themselves renewed—as if they had awoken from a quiet night's rest with a belly full of seal. A narrow ridge spiraled down the cavity's interior slopes. The faint, flickering lights of the Inuits' lamps made shadows churn about them as they descended, doing little to illume their path. The animals soon refused to be prodded any further into the abyss, and all the tribe shared their hesitation. Arluk, still clad in the skin of the mono-horned demon, looked angrily among his company, then turned to his father. Oogroq chanted and danced again. The crater's darkness fled from green, mephitic fires that erupted off of huge torches arrayed upon the walls and floor. At the nadir of the bowl-shaped hollow a great circle of five marble stones was revealed, each marvelously carved with curvilinear inscriptions and intricate bas-reliefs. The delicacy of the carvings was preserved as if time itself was in this place halted, none seemed touched by erosion. The Nakotiqa, long surrendered to primitivism, marveled at the sophistication of their ancestors. To have carved these monuments was to have possessed a lore they had long forgotten. None but the shaman could read the sigils, but all understood the story told by the bas-reliefs. Winged heroes and majestic giants, some with the heads or bodies of beasts, were depicted in conflict with things , fiends of terrible aspect—tentacled, twisted, and amorphous. \"Behold!\" roared the masked angakkuq in the tongue of his tribe, and a symbol revealed itself in platinum lines on the ground between the graven plinths. It was a star. Its five radial arms warped sunwise from a central eye of fire. \"Fire and Ice, Defender and Doom, clash at the turn of the age,\" pronounced Arluk in a voice that echoed endlessly about the chasm. He widened his arms, glanced about his followers and said, \"Nakotiq brothers and sisters, we meet here our destiny. Fear not, grieve not, for the Great Spirits, and the Grey Flame, guide us to salvation!\" Enraptured by their chieftain's words, the Nakotiqa formed a circle of hands around the Elder Sign. Arluk approached the glowing glyph's eye and raised the whalebone rod. The old wizard Oogroq stayed outside the circle and went to each of the oxen and elk in turn, opened the skull face of the mask to reveal the starburst face beneath, and silently struck them dead with an exhalation of breath.

Prolouge A swallow swooped through the skies of Paris, humming a jovial tune. \"La, la-la-la-la la-la, la-la! If you follow your heart! Ho, ho-ho-ho-ho ho-ho, ho-ho! When you follow your heart!\" Stopping to perch on a weather cane, the swallow calls out to the seemingy empty streets. \"Hello! Welcome to Paris, city of love! Who am I?\" The bird asks, sweeping his hat off in a bow. \"I am Jacquimo! Swallow extraordinaire, and lover of beautiful things!\" Flying off his perch, Jacquimo continues on his merry way, singing out the same tune as before. \"You're sure to do impossible things! If you follow your heart! Your dreams will fly on magical wings! When you follow your heart!\" He lands on a gargoyle on the Notre Dame cathedral, continuing his talk with no one. \"Oh, that is very nice, n'est-ce pas? And I like what it is saying! It is saying, 'Follow your heart, and nothing is impossible!'\" Laughing, Jacquimo swoops through a hole in a stained glass window, singing his song. \"You're sure to do impossible things!\" He warbles, landing on a hat, before giving kisses to an imaginary audience. \"Ha ha! I love the sound of my voice! When you follow your heart! When. You. Follow. Your heart!\" Finishing his song, Jacquimo flops back onto the hat, kicking off his shoes. \"I love great romances!\" The swallow declares. \"I myself am a swallow of great passion! La amor! These are stories about people with impossible problems,\" he gestures at stacks of books around the room. \"Samson loved Delilah. Oh, that was really impossible. Romeo et Juliet. Oh, impossible. But the most impossible of all the stories is impossibly small.\" He gestures at a small, pink book about the size of a thumb. \"The story of Thumbelina and Ivalyn.\" The book opens, showing the picture of an old woman, who was staring sadly at a crib. \"Once upon a time, there was a lonely woman, who longed to have a child of her own,\" Jacquimo narates, as the pages turn to show the woman being handed something by a witch. \"One day, she paid a visit to a good witch, who gave her a tiny barleycorn. 'Plant it in a flowerpot,' she says, 'and see what happens.' The woman did as she was told, and by and by it began growing. Until at last...\" We see the woman waters the plant, as the giant bud on top becomes lush and red. \"Oh, what a pretty flower!\" The woman says to herself, before kissing the flower. As she watches, the magical blossom opens up in the sunlight, revealing a tiny girl inside. She had long caramel hair, and wore a pretty cornflower blue dress. As the woman watched in astonishment, the tiny girl stretched out, opening her lovely blue eyes. The woman begins to smile, and holds out her hand for the girl to step on. \"Hello, Mother,\" the girl greets, smiling up at the woman. As the girl holds onto her mother's thumb, the woman smiles wider than before. \"I will call you 'Thumbelina.'\" She says happily, before another voice spoke up. \"Hello? Is anyone there? Why is it so dark?\" Thumbelina and her mother look over at the plant to see a second bud, a violet one, sprouted beside the first. \"Oh!\" The woman cried, before leaning down to kiss that bud as well. It opened up to reveal a second girl, blinking her green eyes at the sudden light. She had long raven hair, and wore a violet dress. \"Hello, Mother,\" she greeted the woman looking down on her happily. Now she had two children, who she already loved with all her heart. She held out her hand, and the girl stepped on it, smiling over at Thumbelina. \"Hello, sister,\" she greeted Thumbelina, as they smiled at each other. \"I will call you 'Ivalyn.'\" The woman says, as the two sisters embrace. \"Thumbelina and Ivalyn.\" Jacquimo says, as we see them turn back into an image. \"But, can you imagine the troubles for two little girls, no bigger than your thumb, hmm?\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 We see the woman drawing water from a well, as the farm animals stand around her, bobbing their heads to a tune. The woman pours water into a trough, as Thumbelina sits on the side of it, Ivalyn nowhere to be found. \" Who is a girl no bigger than a bumblebee ?\" A goose sings, before the goat interrupts. \" Who is the angel with a funny name? \" Thumbelina stands up, but the goat's breath knocks her into the water of the trough. \" We don't know where she's from or how she came to be, \" the cow says, as he uses his nose ring to help Thumbelina out of the water. \" But happy was the day she came!\" The three sing together in chorus. \" Thumbelina! \" The hens all sing. \" She's a funny little squirt!\" \"Thumbelina!\" \"Tiny angel in a skirt.\" \"Thumbelina!\" \"First she's mending, then baking, pretending, she's making things up.\" \"Thumbelina!\" As her mother sweeps, Thumbelina mimicks her with a feather. \"Who would believe the wonder of the world I see? Each little minute brings a new surprise. There's only one peculiar thing that bothers me. Seems I'm the only one my size!\" She falls down through a hole in the wood of the porch, landing in a chicken's nest, where three eggs hatch. All three newborn chicks being larger than Thumbelina is. \"Thumbelina!\" \"Think of all you'll save on meals.\" \"Thumbelina!\" \"Maybe if you had high heels!\" A hen pushes a chick out of the way, so that the chick can't access any corn. Using her size, Thumbelina squeezes bewteen the chickens and brings some corn back to the chick. \"Thumbelina!\" \"If you stay here forever, we know that, we'll never be glum.\" \"By gum.\" \"Thumbelina!\" \"She's always in the thick.\" \"Thumbelina!\" \"But I get out in the nick!\" The animals and Thumbelina's mother stand by a plum tree, all helping to pick fruit, while Thumbelina stands in the plum basket. \"Thumbelina!\" \"Fortune sometimes, has tricked us, but this time, it's picked us.\" \"Oh, a plum's so big (A plum), and a figs so big, and they call it a twig, but a twigs so big!\" \"It's a great, big world!\" \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina! Thumbelina!\" \" That's me!\" Thumbelina cries happily, as she hugged her mother's thumb. Meanwhile, in a corner of the house just above the river, Ivalyn was climbing up the ivy growing on the side of the house. \"Just a bit higher,\" she grunted as she clambered up onto another leaf. Turning around, Ivalyn peered down at the river below. \"Hmm. I guess this is high enough.\" And with that, she threw herself off of the leaf into the air. Ivalyn closed her eyes as she fell, imagining that she was flying through the sky. Then, she opened her eyes and straightened her hands into a dive. She cut through the water like a hot knife through butter, and then swam over to the shore. She clambered out of the water, soaked, before beginning her walk up through the grass towards the house. \"Oh, if only I had real wings! That would be just amazing!\" Ivalyn sighed, remembering the rush of pure joy she had gotten only moments ago while falling. \"If only...\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 2 That night, Thumbelina and Ivalyn settle down to listen to their mother read a story to them. \"Now, here's a story about the noble dog who saved the king from the wicked wizard.\" In the background, Hero, the family dog, pretends to be the brave dog from the story. \"Once upon a time-\" \"Oh, Mother, please!\" Ivalyn piped up from her perch on her mother's head. \"Can you read us another story with people with wings in them? Like 'Pinocchio,' or 'Cinderella!'\" \"Well, alright. Here, how about a story about fairies.\" \"Fairies?\" Thumbelina asked. \"You mean like the Blue Fairy, and the Fairy Godmother?\" \"Well, actually, those are just the bigger fairies. Most fairies are little people with wings on their back. Why, I'd say they'd be just about your size.\" \"Really?\" The sisters exclaimed together, excited. Their mother nodded, and flipped to a page with fairy illustrations on it. \"As a matter of fact, there are. Look,\" their mother tilted her head toward the book, causing the sisters to fall off of her head, and into her hand. She set them down on the page, where they stood next to a fairy illustration that was the same size they were. \"They are little,\" Thumbelina gasps. \"Just like you and me, Ivalyn!\" \"Well, except for the wings,\" Ivalyn adds. \"Of course, but they are still our size!\" \"Mother? Have you ever seen a fairy?\" Ivalyn asks, looking up at her mother. \"Well, I thought I did once.\" \"Really?\" Thumbelina asks in wonder. \"Yes. And here, the fairy prince and princess are having a wedding.\" Their mother lowers her glasses so that magnify the image of the two fairies in love. \"And they live happily ever after!\" Ivalyn declares. \"Oh, usually, dear.\" \"Hmm,\" Thumbelina slid under the glasses, looking up at her mother. \"I suppose it works best if, if two people are about the same size.\" \"Yes, of course,\" her mother said, realizing where this was headed. \"Yes.\" Thumbelina repeated, crawling out from under the glasses, while her mother looks on sadly. \"Well, that's not fair. Ivalyn and I must be the only people our size in the whole world. I wish we were big.\" \"Oh no, Thumbelina. No. Don't ever wish to be anything but what you are.\" \"But, Mother,\" Ivalyn spoke up, sitting down next to her sister. \"We're so different. We're too small to be humans like you, and we don't have wings, so we can't be fairies. What are we?\" \"Oh, Ivalyn. You two are my daughters, and being different isn't a bad thing at all. Now then, bedtime my dears. It's been a long day. You must go to sleep now.\" The two sisters crawled into their mother's hand, and she brought them over to their walnut shell beds. \"Sleep tight.\" \"Mother?\" Thumbelina asked. \"Would you please leave the book open? I wanna look at the pictures while I go to sleep.\" \"Of course dear.\" Grabbing their walnut beds, their mother set them down on a book on a table, before opening the book to the page with the fairy pictures. \"There.\" \"Good night, Mother!\" The sisters chorused. \"Good night, Thumbelina. Good night, Ivalyn,\" their mother replied, before turning to Hero. \"You take good care of them, Hero.\" And with that, their mother exited the room. Climbing out of bed, Thumbelina and Ivalyn walked up to the picture of the fairy outside a mushroom home. Thumbelina sighed, before she turned around, and began to sing. \" I know there's someone. Somewhere. Someone. Who's sure to find me, soon.\" Ivalyn joined her sister by the window, and started singing herself. \" After the rain goes, there are rainbows. I'll find my rainbow soon.\" The sisters looked at each other, before singing in chorus. \"Soon, it won't be just pretend. Soon, a happy ending. Love, can you hear us? If you're near us. Sing, your song. Sure, and strong, and soon...\" Thumbelina sighed. \"Do you think there really are such things as fairies?\" Thumbelina asked Ivalyn, who smiled at her sister. \"I'm absolutely postive. If two girls can be born from a flower, then I'm positive that fairies can exist too!\" \"Well, I suppose that must be true,\" Thumbelina sighed. \"But then again, Mother hasn't even seen a fairy up close. What are the chances that we'll meet one?\" Ivalyn frowned at her sister's sad tone, walking over and placing a hand on her shoulder. \"Thumbelina, if you truly wish for something to happen with all of your heart, someday, it is sure to come true.\" Seeing her sister was still slightly sad, Ivalyn tried to think of how to make her happier. Suddenly, she got an idea. \"Wait here, I've got an idea that'll cheer you up.\" Hurrying over to Hero, Ivalyn clambered onto his head and whispered into his ear. Hero yawned before he dropped to the floor, padding over to a small chest filled with tiny clothing.[Chapter 4] In case no one got it, the reason I didn't update is because I got no reviews, so I didn't know if you liked or hated it. It's when I get the reviews that I update. Anywho, on with the chapter! Chapter 3 Meanwhile, outside in the surrounding countryside, a parade of fairies was turning the leaves gold. In the middle of the parade was the king and queen of fairies. Suddenly the queen of fairies turned around, and noticed two empty carriages behind them. \"Oh, my dear. Don't look now dear husband, but our sons are missing again.\" \"So they are. I think they feel a bit silly, riding those white butterflies we gave them.\" \"Why should they feel silly?\" \"It, it doesn't quite make the right impression on the young ladies.\" \"Well what about the impression on the court?! Colbert, my love, it is the autumn today, and we've begun the golding of the leaves! They should be here!\" \"Tabitha-\" \"They'll hurt themselves! I just hope they're not out buzzing the vales on that wretched bumblebee and dragonfly! They are the fairy princes for heavens sake!\" \"Tabitha dear, have you forgotten what it's like to be sixteen?\" As the fairies leave the farm Thumbelina and Ivalyn live on, two golden lights streak by. \"Ha! Take that Chrysanthos! I'm gonna win!\" A young fairy boy with short auburn hair riding a bumblebee yells at another blonde haired fairy behind him, who was riding a dragonfly. \"Whoa! Wait a second!\" Chrysanthos stops and follows his brother onto a windowsill, where they can see a beautiful girl singing inside. \"Oh! Hello, what a beautiful voice.\" Cornelius whispered, staring at the girl. \"She's quite pretty as well.\" Chrysanthos added, staring at her. \"I wonder who she is.\" \"Come on, Cornelius. Let's investigate.\" \"Alright, stay here you two.\" Cornelius told the two insects, before sneaking inside with his brother. They hid behind the book and stared out at the girl. Suddenly, a Hero returned, and from his head, Ivalyn climbed down. Over her dress she was wearing a skirt of lace that she had made a few weeks ago with the help of her mother, along with small golden threads woven through her hair. \"Sister,\" Ivalyn, announced. \"I will dance for you, if you wish it.\" While the two princes hiding behind the book stared at each other in shock at the appearance of another beautiful girl, Thumbelina clapped her hands in delight at her sister's attempt to cheer her up. For although Thumbelina's voice was the sweeter of the two, Ivalyn's dancing was simply magical. \"Oh, yes please!\" Thumbelina agreed, taking a seat on the edge of her bed. \"Can you sing a song for me to dance to, sister?\" Ivalyn asked her sister, who nodded happily, before opening her mouth to sing. \" Constant as the stars above, Always know that you are loved, And my love shining in you, Will help you make your dreams come true, Will help your dreams come true.\" As Thumbelina sang, Ivalyn twirled around on the book, her movements flowing together like water. Her lace skirt whirled with her, giving her the appearance of an angel. The two princes hiding behind the book could only watch in shock. \"Her voice is so lovely,\" Cornelius whispered, staring at Thumbelina, whose face portrayed the joy she was feeling. Meanwhile Chrysanthos was staring at Ivalyn's dance. \"Beautiful,\" he whispered, almost in a trance as he watched her. \"The lamb lies down and rests it's head, On it's mother's downy bed, Dolphin plays in the moonlight's glow, And butterfly dreams of a violet rose, Dreams of a violet rose. I'll cradle you in my arms tonight, As sun embraces the moonlight, The clouds will carry us off tonight, Our dreams will run deep like the sea, Our dreams will run deep like the sea. Constant as the stars above, Always know that you are loved, And my love shining in you, Will help you make your dreams come true, Will help your dreams come true.\" Thumbelina finished her song softly, and Ivalyn slowly dipped into a low cursty, ending her dance with her lace skirt spread around her on the book. \"Do you feel better now, 'Lina?\" Ivalyn asked, raising from her ending pose. Slipping out of the skirt, she walked over to Thumbelina. \"Oh, I feel much better!\" Thumbelina cried happily, hugging her sister. \"Thank you for dancing for me.\" \"Well, I don't feel very tired yet,\" Ivalyn told her. \"May I have this dance, sister?\" Giggling, the two girls began whirling across the book, humming as they did so. \"Hmmm.\" Cornelius said, thoughtful, making his brother look at him. \"What is it Cornelius?\" Chrysanthos whispered as his brother unsheathed his sword. \"I think I'll try to get a dance too,\" Cornelius said before slashing through the page, exactly where the window was. \"May I cut in?\" He punned, causing Chrysanthos to roll his eyes. The dancing sisters gasped as stopped and saw Cornelius. Letting out twin shrieks, they both dashed for the teapot, slipping inside. \"Idiot,\" Chrysanthos smacked his brother on the back of his head. \"Ow!\" \"You can't just scare people like that. You have to introduce yourself first.\" Fluttering over to the teapot, he peered inside at the two girls. \"I apologize heavily for my brothers rude intrusion. Will you please come out so we can talk?\" \"Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.\" Cornelius joined him, and the two brothers peered into the pot, seeing the two girls at the bottom. They both smiled at the two beautiful girls, who, upon seeing that there was no threat, smiled back, before crawling one by one up the teapot spout. Thumbelina came out first, and was helping her sister out when the brothers noticed that they had emerged. \"Ah,\" Cornelius said, leaping over to stand by Thumbelina, who, frightened by his sudden approach, accidently let go of her sister, who slid back down into the pot. \"Hey!\" Ivalyn yelled out, before she climbed back up, her sister looking at her apologetically. She stood up, and went to stand by her sister, before both stared at the two boys who were their exact size. \"What, wait a minute. What are you staring at?\" Cornelius asked. The sisters looked down, still sneaking glances at the two. \"Well, say something, will you?\" Chrysanthos asked, impatient, only for Thumbelina to suddenly catch sight of their wings. \"Oh! Ivalyn! They're, oh!\" Thumbelina gasped, pointing back at the fairy illustrations in the book. \"They're some of them!\" \"I beg your pardon?\" Cornelius asked in confusion, while Ivalyn stared in awe at their wings. \"Fairies.\" She breathed out in awe. \"Do you know what this means? We're not the only ones our size!\" Just then, Hero woke up, and noticing the two strangers, growled. The princes unsheathed their swords, taking defensive stances in front of the girls, only for the sisters to quickly jump in front of them. \"Hero, no! No, no, they're friends!\" Thumbelina cried, trying to placate the dog. \"Look, um, hello, my name is Thumbelina. How do you do, sirs?\" \"Um, uh, thank you, thank you for coming to visit,\" Ivalyn added, both sisters dipping into graceful curtsies. \"Oh, um, oh yes! No trouble at all.\" Cornelius replies, the two brothers sheathing their swords. \"Yes, um, the pleasure is all ours!\" Chrysanthos adds, both bowing to the girls. Sensing no threat, Hero settled down, and fell back asleep. The four of them all shared amused looks before Thumbelina turned towards the brothers. \"Sorry about that.\" She apologized, before Cornelius stepped towards her. \"Thumbelina. Oh, it's a lovely name!\" \"Thank you.\" \"And you are?\" Chrysanthos asked, stepping closer to the raven haired girl. \"Ivalyn. And what are your names?\" \"I'm Chrysanthos,\" he introduced, before grabbing her hand and placing a chaste kiss on her knuckles. \"It's an honor to meet you, lovely Ivalyn.\" Ivalyn blushed at the praise, smiling shyly at the prince. \"I'm Cornelius,\" his brother added. \"Cornelius.\" Thumbelina repeated, giggling. \"Well, that's a funny name! Oh, I-I mean, it's perfect.\" Thumbelina looks away in embarrassment, while Cornelius steps closer, smiling softly at her. \"So, can you tell us about the fairy court?\" Ivalyn asks, breaking Cornelius and Thumbelina out of their moment. \"Oh, yes! Tell me, is there a prince?\" Thumbelina asks, stepping closer to Cornelius. \"Two, actually,\" Chrysanthos replies, sliding closer to Ivalyn. \"They must be terribly handsome,\" Thumbelina comments, looking up at Cornelius through long lashes. \"Oh, they are,\" he replies, getting slightly smug. \"Strong and brave,\" Ivalyn continues, stepping so that she and Chrysanthos had only an inch between them. \"None like them,\" Chrysanthos replies, smiling at her. \"We would love to meet the princes.\" \"Oh, I'll tell them.\" \"Oh, thank you,\" Thumbelina replies softly. \"You're welcome,\" Cornelius whispered out, as he leaned towards Thumbelina, Chrysanthos and Ivalyn doing the same. BUUUUZZZZZZ \"Ah! What was that?\" Thumbelina cried looking around in panic. Ivalyn jumped out of Chrysanthos's embrace and picked a needle up, wielding it like a sword. \"Whatever it is, if it wants to hurt you, it has to go through me!\" \"Don't worry, that's just Buzzby, my bumble. See, I left him and my brother's dragonfly Sniper on the sill. They don't like staying in one place for too long.\" \"Well, why didn't you say so?\" Ivalyn asked, dropping her needle. \"Let's go!\" She grabbed Chrysanthos's hand, and dragged him out onto the sill, Thumbelina and Cornelius following. Seeing the girls coming out, both insects buzzed in alarm, before they saw their owners behind them and calmed down. \"Oh, my! Why, he's amazing!\" Thumbelina complimented Buzzby, while Ivalyn looked over at Sniper. \"He's so beautiful. His wings look like crystals!\" The two insects buzzed in pride, while the two brothers smiled. \"Hey! Hey, would you like to go for a spin?\" Cornelius asked Thumbelina, before flying onto the bee. \"Come on! Let's go!\" They started to leave, Thumbelina sighing. \"I wish I had wings.\" She said longingly. \"Maybe someday you will,\" Cornelius told her, before they were off, laughing as they went. Buzzby passed through the river hole in the wall, and they were outside the farm. \"Let me be your wings, Let me be your only love ,\" Cornelius sang to Thumbelina, as kid jitterbugs put a forget-me-not flower necklace over her head. \" Let me lift you far above the stars. Let me be you wings, Let me lift you high above. Everything we're dreaming of will soon be ours .\" They waltzed along the river, Buzzby floating calmly behind them. \" Anthything that you desire, Anything at all. Everyday I'll take you higher, And I'll never let you fall!\" The couple paused momentarily to hitch a ride on the head of a swan, before flying off towards the vegatable patch. \"Let me be your wings, Leave behind the world you know, For another world of wondrous things!\" They landed on a pumpkin, dancing before resuming their flight. \"We'll see the universe, And dance on Saturn's rings! Fly with me, And I will be your wings!\" They flew around the pumpkin, the fairy dust lifting it for a moment, before they left to fly over the meadow. On their flight they passed over two jitterbugs, a young girl and her mother. \"She's gonna marry the fairy prince, huh Mama?\" The little girl asked, before staring after the couple with a dreamy look on her face. \"Well, perhaps,\" her mother replied, wondering the same thing in her head. \" Anything that you desire, Anything at all,\" Cornelius sang to Thumbelina who then echoed his song. \" Anything at all!\" \"Everyday I'll take you higher, And I'll never let you fall !\" He declared, only for Thumbelina to slip from his grasp and fall. He flew down and caught her in bridal style before she hit the ground. \"You will be my wings!\" \"Let me be your wings!\" \"You will be my only love!\" \"Get ready for another world of wondrous things!\" \"Wondrous things are sure to happen!\" \"We'll see the universe, And dance on Saturn's rings !\" They sang in unison landing on some lilypads in front of the Singer's de Espana's showboat. \" Heaven isn't too far ,\" Cornelius lifted Thumbelina onto the rim of the boat before hopping up next to her. \" Heaven is where you are ,\" Thumbelina told him, blowing a kiss towards a toad that had come closer to look at them. \" Stay with me, And let me be your wings/I'll let you be my wings!\" They finished flying into the sky in a burst of fairy dust. Below on the showboat, Mrs. Toad stood with her son Grundel. \"This voice is fantastica!\" She declared looking at the ascending couple. \"Mama, I love her!\" Grundel told his mother with a lovestruck look on his face, causing his mother to smile and look back up at the two with a glint in her eyes. Meanwhile... \"Would you like to take a ride with me too?\" Chrysanthos asked Ivalyn, who merely nodded, and hopped onto the dragonfly. \"Let's do this!\" She exclaimed. Chrysanthos smiled at her in adoration, before flying up, and sitting in front of her. \"Hold on tight,\" he advised her, before Sniper shot off into the night, skimming along the river water. \"I've always wondered what flying was like.\" Ivalyn admitted, her head leaning on his shoulder. \"Sometimes, when I have no chores to do, I climb the ivy on the side of my house, and freefall into the river. Just to see if I feel like I'm flying.\" Chrysanthos blinks in shock. So her greatest desire was to fly? In that case... He guided Sniper to land on the water, before flying up, and hovering next to the dragonfly. \"Do you want to try it now?\" He asked Ivalyn, holding out his hand for her to take. \"Want to try what?\" She asked him, but allowed him to take her hand anyway. \"Flying,\" Chrysanthos whispered, before pulling her flush against him, and shooting up into the sky. Ivalyn began to laugh out of pure delight, as Chrysanthos looked at her lovingly. (AN: This song just totally fits this moment! Disclaimer: It belongs to Disney.) \" I can show you the world. Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me sweetheart, Now when did you last let your heart decide ?\" They swooped through the air; Chrysanthos holding Ivalyn close in the air. \"I can open your eyes. Take you wonder by wonder. Over, sideways, and under, On a magic fairy flight. \" They zoomed down the side of a waterfall, Ivalyn dipping her hand in the rushing water. At the bottom, they began to dance on the water, streaks appearing on the pond where they had been. \" A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no, Or where to go, Or say we're only dreaming.\" They landed on a long vine stretched between two trees, and Ivalyn smiled at Chrysanthos before walking along it. \"A whole new world. A dazzling place I never knew. But when I'm way up here, It's crystal clear, That now I'm in a whole new world with you.\" Spinning slightly, she lost balance, only for Chrysanthos to catch her bridal style. \" Now I'm in a whole new world with you.\" \"Unbelieveable sights, indescribeable feelings. Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling, Through an endless diamond sky. A whole new world.\" They flew high up, before hurtling down, Ivalyn gasping and putting a hand over her eyes. Chrysanthos chuckled and grabbed her hand, pulling it off so she could see. \" Don't you dare close your eyes.\" \"A hundred thousand things to see.\" \"Hold your breath it gets better.\" \"I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far, I can't go back to where I use to be.\" It was true; Ivalyn couldn't see her life without Chrysanthos in it. Even though they had just met, there was undeniably a connection. \"A whole new world.\" \"Every turn a surprise.\" \"With new horizons to pursue.\" \"Every moment red lettered.\" \"I'll chase them anywhere, There's time to spare, Let me share this whole new world with you.\" Landing back on the sill, the two began waltzing together, both completely entranced by the other's mere presence. \" A whole new world.\" \"A whole new world.\" \"That's where we'll be.\" \"That's where we'll be.\" \"A thrilling chase.\" \"A wondrous place-\" \"For you and me.\" They finished their dance with Chrysanthos spinning Ivalyn into a dip. She slowly got up, their faces getting closer together, their lips just about to- \"Hey Ivalyn!\" Thumbelina cried as she and Cornelius descended from the skies on Buzzby. Chrysanthos and Ivalyn jumped apart, both blushing, the moment ruined. \"Oh, Thumbelina,\" Cornelius sighed as he helped her off of Buzzby. \"Oh, wow. Something, I don't know, something happened to me tonight. Something I never want to forget.\" \"Me too,\" Thumbelina agreed, blushing as she took off a flower necklace. \"Do not forget me.\" \"Forget-me-nots.\" Cornelius said, indicating the flower. \"Oh, I'll never forget you. Never.\" He declared to her, taking off his ring and putting it on her left hand's ring finger. \"Never, never.\" Thumbelina agreed, leaning up to- \"Cornelius! Chrysanthos!\" Tabitha cried off in the distance. \"Oh, Mother,\" Cornelius scowled, annoyed that their moment was ruined. \"What- Mother!\" He suddenly realized, turning around in panic before looking back at Thumbelina. \"You two, come now!\" Tabitha cried again in the distance. \"Who are those people?\" Ivalyn asked, as Chrysanthos's hand grabbed hers, and dragged her inside the house, after his brother and Thumbelina. \"There's no time to explain,\" Chrysanthos whispered, as Cornelius shushed Buzzby. \"That's the queen of the fairies, our mother.\" \"Your mother?\" Thumbelina asked, realizing what that meant. \"Yeah, look we must go now, but, well, can we see you tomorrow?\" Cornelius asked Thumbelina and Ivalyn, Chrysanthos peering outside for signs of Tabitha. \"Your mother?\" Ivalyn repeated. \"Then you're the, you two are the- tomorrow?\" \"Yes, tomorrow,\" Chrysanthos told them, coming to stand by Ivalyn. \"Yes, we're the princes.\" \"The princes?\" Thumbelina repeated, shocked. \"Yeah. Look, will you meet my parents?\" Cornelius asked Thumbelina, taking her hands in his. \"Cornelius! Chrysanthos!\" Tabitha cried, closer than before. \"Say you will,\" Chrysanthos begged Ivalyn. \"We, we will,\" she replied. \"You will?\" Chrysanthos repeated, excited. \"We will,\" Thumbelina also agreed. \"We will, Prince Cornelius and Prince Chrysanthos, yes!\" \"Cornelius!\" Tabitha cried once more. \"Chrysanthos!\" Colbert joined in. \"Ah, we've gotta go,\" Cornelius cried. \"Will they like us?\" Ivalyn asked Chrysanthos, standing up and looking out the window. \"Shhh, get down. Yes, they'll love you! But let us talk to them first, tonight.\" \"And then we'll be back for you in the morning,\" Cornelius added. \"Then you can meet our mother,\" Thumbelina told them, Ivalyn nodding in agreement. \"Well, great! But, well, wait here,\" he told her. \"And then, we'll live happily ever after,\" Thumbelina whispered. \"Oh, much longer,\" Cornelius agreed, leaning in to kiss- \"Cornelius! Chrysanthos!\" Colbert yelled, stopping the almost kiss. \"Ohh, goodbye!\" Cornelius told her, rushing out onto the sill, and hopping onto Buzzby. \"Wait,\" Ivalyn grabbed Chrysanthos' arm, momentarily stopping him from heading onto the sill. Unraveling one of the golden threads in her hair, she placed it in his palm. \"T-take this with you, to remember me by.\" Blushing, Ivalyn looked down, embarrassed by her bold action, only to look up as a warm hand enveloped hers, and something cool slid onto her finger. \"Thank you, Ivalyn. I will never forget you.\" Slipping away from her, he rushed out onto the sill joining his brother. \"You won't forget to come back, will you?\" Thumbelina asked Cornelius, who hopped onto his impatiently buzzing dragonfly. \"We promise,\" the two brothers agreed in sync. Both leaning forward to kiss- Buzzby and Sniper took off, shooting off into the sky, the brothers waving goodbye. The sisters waved back, before going back inside, both sighing the names of their princes. \"Hey, 'Lina,\" Ivalyn suddenly said as they were drifting off to sleep. \"Yeah, Ivalyn?\" She replied sleepily. \"I told you if you wished for something hard enough, you'd get it.\"[Chapter 5] Ok, I'd just like to take a moment to dedicate this fic. I've decided to dedicate it to Roseflame Crystalheart; my only reviewer. So anyway, enjoy the chapter Roseflame! Chapter 4 Later that night, while the two sisters are fast asleep, the window cracks open, and a figure dressed in scarlet hops in. She goes over to the two walnut beds, and looks between them, seeing the two nearly identical girls sleeping inside. \"Which girl is the right one?\" The figure mutters, before shrugging and deciding to just take them both. \"Gotcha!\" The figure cries, snapping shut the two shells, and pulling one up under each arm. The two sisters immediately wake up with identical cries of, \"What?!\" Hearing them, Hero wakes up, confused. \"Hey, help!\" Thumbelina cried. \"Help, Hero! Let us out of here!\" Ivalyn adds in, causing Hero to look over and see the figure trying to get them out the window. \"Oh, oh! Hero, help. Help me!\" Thumbelina cried again, as the old dog leapt into action. \"A dog!\" The figure gasps, seeing Hero slam the window shut. \"Get away from me!\" The figure hopped all around the room, knocking over furniture as Hero gave chase. Hopping up to the window, the figure pushed it open and hopped out. Hero leapt out as well, trying to follow, only for a kite string to wrap around his leg, causing the wind to push him up into the air. Skimming along the surface of the water, Hero reached out for the sisters' beds, only for the figure to escape through the small river hole in the wall. Hero tried to follow the figure through, only to get stuck. He howled mournfully as the figure got away with the two girls. The figure took off their mask, and waved it at the dog, revealing Mrs. Toad. The next morning, the entire farm was silent, except for the woman, who was sobbing in the kitchen. All the animals watched sadly, while Hero slunk sadly upstairs. The two princes on top of their respective insects buzzed through the air towards the cottage, each carrying several gifts. \"Thumbelina!\" Cornelius cried, landing on the sill, before dropping the trinkets he was carrying. \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina! Oops. Got it.\" He took off his helmet, and looked around the room smiling, trying to find the small girl. \"Ivalyn? Ivalyn it's me! Where are you?\" Chrysanthos asked, only to see the furniture strewn about haphazardly. Realizing something was wrong, the brothers began flying around the room, looking for the girls while calling their names. Finally, the brothers flew over to Hero, who was crying in the corner. They landed on his nose, and as the dog looked up and noticed the two familiar figures, he began to bark. \"Where are they? What? What happened?\" Cornelius asked the dog, who stood up while pantomiming what took place. \"They were stolen away? Out the window?\" Chrysanthos translated in disbelief. \"Who did it?\" Cornelius asked, now visibly angry. Hero makes a big puffing noise with his cheeks. \"A toad?\" Chrysanthos cried in horror. \"Good dog,\" Cornelius tells Hero. \"We'll find them.\" Hero jumps up to join them, but Chrysanthos shakes his head. \"No, Hero. Look, you stay here, and take care of Thumbelina's mother. Let her know everything will be alright.\" With that, the two princes buzz off on their insects, as Hero whines encouragement. Somewhere on the river, the toad's boat floats, with the two beds on the center of it. Inside the beds, the two girls are waking up. \"Bienos dias. I hope you sleep very very good.\" Mrs. Toad says, popping out from behind a curtain. \"Huh? Who are you?\" Ivalyn cries, terrified. \"We are the very happy family Singers de Espana.\" Mrs. Toad answers, shedding her scarlet cloak to show a very revealing costume. \"These are my sons: Mozo, Gringo, and Grundel.\" At this, three toads hop out, Mozo and Gringo smiling, and Grundel looking like he had a case of the Mondays. \"We are very rich and famous,\" Mrs. Toad continues. \"Rich and famous?\" Thumbelina questions her. \"Si si. Mucho. I bring you two here to become very famous singers, like me.\" Mrs. Toad proclaims, shaking back and forth in a Shakira like dance. \"Goodbye,\" Thumbelina tells her, as she and Ivalyn get out of bed. \"Our mother will be very worried.\" They try to scurry off the boat, only for Mozo, Gringo, and Grundel to hop over and block them. \"Mama no worry,\" Mrs. Toad reassures them. \"Mama proud! When you are stars, she make big fiesta, and invite all the neighbors to see her little ninas who have become big, big, big, very big!\" \"Big?\" Thumbelina asks, imagining herself as tall as a human. \"You mean, big?\" \"I mean important,\" Mrs. Toad tells her. \"And loved by everyone.\" \"But ah, Chrysanthos and Cornelius love us already,\" Ivalyn contradicts, causing her sister to smile. \"I think I'm gonna marry Cornelius,\" Thumbelina tells Mrs. Toad, who starts to try to convince Thumbelina otherwise. \"Marry him? That will be a very big mistake. It'll get in the way of your careers in show business; doing things domestico.\" \"What things?\" Ivalyn questions, not really liking Mrs. Toad. \"The scrubbings and the washings, And the noses with the drippings, And the sopas always boiling.\" \" Si, \" the three sons add. \"The panes of windows falling, With the diapers changing, With the roof, she's leaking, And the enchiladas spoiling.\" \"Ooh.\" \"Do you know how to do these things, Like you will have to do these things, Or does the very thought of it, make you wince?\" \"Well if it's for my kids, not really, no.\" Ivalyn said, but Mrs. Toad just ignored her. \"I thought so. Then, don't marry, the prince.\" \"Oh, dear,\" Thumbelina says as she watches Mrs. Toad doing her Shakira moves again. \"You see? You become big star like me. We make big moneys together. You make Mama rich.\" The last sentence was what got Thumbelina dancing. She'd do anything to help her mother. As they danced, river creatures began gathering, watching the show. \"You're important person. You are famous. You are a star.\" Mrs. Toad cried, as Thumbelina steps down onto a lily pad in front of the boat. \"A star? Well, I suppose,\" she said. \"Hello? Sister, what about Cornelius? You love him, remember?\" Ivalyn reminded her, only for Mama Toad to knock her onto another lily pad. \"Hush up. If you good, you can be background singer,\" Mrs. Toad told Ivalyn, before turning back to teaching Thumbelina the routine. \"Now, repeat after me; We are the Singers de Espana, the original cast, And there hasn't been a town we haven't played.\" \"We are the Singers de Espana and we sing very fast. We get on, we get off, we get paid.\" The three sons began to sing too. \"Uh, could you say that a little slower?\" Thumbelina requested. \"Slower? We don't do ballads.\" Mrs. Toad scoffed. \"Oh, well then maybe she can take notes,\" Ivalyn said sarcastically, only to have Mrs. Toad splash her with water. \"We are free and independent we go everywhere, And we gotcha-gotcha-gootchee all the way. We gonna teach you how to samba, And to rumba y La Bamba. Every number, Thumbelina, say ole! Come on the road, My little castanet. Come on the road, And famous you will get. I'll make you star, Get you small guitar. You'll be hot muchacha, Once I gotcha On the road!\" Thumbelina hops back onto the boat, only for the three toad sons to corner her with a conga line. \" Thumbelinacita! No one could be sweeter! Sing with Mamacita! We go on the road!\" Grundel grabs Thumbelina's hand, only for her to jerk out of his grasp. \"Now we sing. We open Monday in Medina, Then we do Babylon, Then we hop to Barcelona for a week. Then a month in Athens at the Parthenon, Where they love us cause we do the show in Greek!\" \"We are the finest in the business, It's a well known fact. And you'll forgive us if we have to blow the horn.\" \"Because this isn't any ordinary animal act, And today a star is born!\" The sons lift Thumbelina in the air, before they set her down. \"Go on the road, You'll hear the peoples roar. You're not a toad-\" \"But that's what makeup's for!\" \"Just sing on pitch, We get very rich!\" Grundel eyed Thumbelina as he sang. \"Wait until they see the Thumbelina-\" \"On the road!\" \"Singing Thumbelina! Dancing Thumbelina! Something Thumbelina!\" But Thumbelina just shook her head stubbornly and crossed her arms. \"Now I make her sing!\" Mrs. Toad declared, before stomping on Thumbelina's foot, which caused her to let out a high F in pain. \"You got it!\" \"Hey! Don't do that to my sister!\" Ivalyn cried, only to get a mouthful of water. \"Come on the road! We make you big success! Come on the road!\" \"You're in the Union, yes?\" \"The life she's sweet, Lot's of flies to eat!\" \"Yum-yum!\" \"Why be a little fish in little pond, When you can go so far beyond?\" \"I think perhaps we make you blond!\" \"When we get on the road!\" \"On the road,\" Thumbelina sang, finally taking part in the routine. \" Let's hit the road...ole!\" They all finished, as the creatures watching the show all cheered and threw coins at the performers. Ivalyn just watched on the side, sighing at how easily her sister had been misled. \"Mama,\" Grundel whispered with Mrs. Toad, as Thumbelina curtsied before the audience. \"You give her to me. I marry her.\" \"Very well,\" Mrs. Toad agreed. \"You can marry la nina. We can keep the money she earns in the family. The question is what do we do with her untalented sister?\" Just then, Thumbelina ran up to the two. \"Oh, thank you Mrs. Toad! Thank you. They really like me! Am I a star?\" \"Yes,\" Mrs. Toad replied. \"And you can call me 'Mama!'\" \"Mama?\" Thumbelina replied in confusion. \"You're going to marry my son, Grundel!\" \"I'm what?!\" Thumbelina asked in shock, as Mrs. Toad led her over to a lily pad surrounded by water. \"I love Thumbelina!\" Grundel proclaimed. \"You wait right here, Thumbelinachicita,\" Mrs. Toad said as she dropped Thumbelina on the lily pad. \"We'll be right back with the Padre!\" \"Oh, no, no,\" Thumbelina tried to argue as they got ready to leave. \"See, I love Cornelius.\" \"Today, you marry my son!\" Mrs. Toad said, as they all hopped onto the boat, the audience members all cheering, and then leaving. Come back here! No, wait, wait a second! Where are you going?!\" The toads all boated away leaving Thumbelina alone on the lily pad. \"Doesn't anybody care what I think?!\" \"I do!\" Ivalyn said, her head popping out of the water as she crawled onto the lily pad. \"Ivalyn! You know how to swim?\" Thumbelina asked her sister in shock. \"Of course I do. I swim in our river almost every week. Now come on, let's get you off this lily pad!\" With that, Ivalyn swam down and started yanking on the lily pad stem. After about a minute, she came up and flopped beside her sister on the lily pad. \"It's no use, that stem is too thick. I'd need something sharp to cut it.\" Ivalyn sighed, and turned to embrace her sister. \"I'm sorry Thumbelina. Um, maybe I could try to teach you to swim in under three minutes? Who am I kidding. We're stuck. Maybe we can try calling for help?\" Jacquimo flew through the meadow, humming the same tune as always, when a cry was heard from below. \"Help!\" \"Someone help!\" \"Anyone, please!\" \"Whoa, help?\" The swallow repeated, before flying around looking for the voices. \"Who is saying 'help?'\" \"Mr. Bird! Over here!\" Thumbelina cried, happy that someone had answered their call for help. \"Oh! Little ones, are you having a bad day?\" Jacquimo asked, landing on a cattail. \"My sister and I were sleeping on the windowsill, waiting for Prince Cornelius and Prince Chrysanthos to come back, and they said they would come before morning because they love us, and-\" \"They love you two?\" Jacquimo interrupted. \"Yes, but-\" \"Congratulations!\" \"Thanks, but, well, but we were stolen away by Mrs. Toad, who says I have to marry her son! And I just-\" \"A toad? That is a very bad day, Mademoiselle, uh, Mademoiselle?\" \"Thumbelina.\" \"Ivalyn.\" \"Thumbelina, Ivalyn, I am Jacquimo! How can I be of service, to you two?\" \"Well, I must get off this lily pad, and only my sister knows how to swim, and we can't cut the stem, so you see, it's rather impossible.\" \"Ha-ha-ha! Nothing is impossble!\" Jacquimo declared, before diving into the river, and cutting the stem with his beak. \"Voila!\" \"Well, you made that look easy,\" Ivalyn muttered, searching for a way to steer the lily pad drifting down the river. \"Now if we can just reach the shore before those awful toads come back!\" \"Do you mean if you can reach the shore before you go over the waterfall?!\" Jacquimo cried from his perch back upon the cattail. \"What waterfall?\" Thumbelina cried. \"That one!\" \"Is it bad?\" In response, Jacquimo flew down, and began trying to pull the lily pad the other way, but the current was too strong. \"I am slipping!\" \"Don't let go!\" Ivalyn cried, searching for a way to save her and her sister. \"Can you swim?\" \"Ivalyn can, but I can't! I can't even float! Help! Help, please!\" Thumbelina cried, her sister and Jacquimo joining in. Underwater, two fish enjoying their morning heard their cries, and seeing the peril that the occupants of the lily pad were in, swam up to help. On the shore, two jitterbugs trying to cut a cattail joined in the rescue party as well, with other jitterbugs coming along to help. As the lily pad neared the waterfall, the fish used their fins to push the lily pad upstream. In the process, however, Ivalyn was thrown from the lily pad and sent hurtling over the waterfall. \"Ivalyn!\" Thumbelina cried, seeing her sister fall over the edge. \"Thumbelina!\" Ivalyn cried back, before she plummeted into the pool at the bottom of the waterfall. \"Pull, mes amis! Pull! That is it! Higher, higher!\" Jacquimo cried to the jitterbugs, as they pulled Thumbelina away from the waterfall. Jacquimo was flipped onto shore by a fish, and the swallow sat up, hacking up water. The gathered creatures all stared at an unconscience Thumbelina, whispering curiously. \"What is it?\" One spoke up. \"Yeah. Who is it?\" Another asked. \"Look, Mama. She's waking up,\" the little girl who Thumbelina and Cornelius had passed in their flight whispered to her mother. \"Oh, are you feeling better little one?\" Jacquimo asked her as she sat up. \"But wait, where is the other little one?\" \"Ivalyn!\" Thumbelina cried, remembering what had just happened. \"Oh, she went over the waterfall! I have to find her! I do hope she's alright.\" That was when she noticed all the assembled creatures surrounding her. \"But, who are you all?\" Thumbelina asked them all. \"Thumbelina, these are the jitterbugs,\" Jacquimo introduced, while the two fish swam back to their home. \"You stay here with them, I will go see if I can find your sister at the bottom of the falls.\" With that, Jacquimo took to the air and swooped to the bottom of the falls. \"The jitterbugs? Oh, ah how do you do?\" She politely greeted them. \"Are you really gonna marry one of the fairy princes?\" The little jitterbug girl asked, stepping forward. \"If he asks me,\" Thumbelina replied, giggling. \"He and his brother will call for my sister and I at our house. Well, that's why we want to go home. Besides, mother will be terribly worried. If only I could find my sister and figure out which way home is.\" \"Oh, we'll help you, Thumbelina.\" The little jitterbug girl told her, the other jitterbugs agreeing. \"Yeah, nobody'll hurt ya, Thumbelina!\" \"Not with us on the job, right!\" \"Right!\" \"Oh, you are all very brave, thank you.\" Thumbelina told them, before visibly saddening. \"But, I'm afraid I'll never see my sister, or my home, again.\" \"Oh, well, there was no sign of your sister at the bottom,\" Jacquimo chirped, landing beside Thumbelina. \"She must have floated further downstream. Since she can swim, that probably means that she is still alive!\" \"Well how will I ever find her?\" Thumbelina cried, slightly happier now that her sister probably wasn't dead. \"Oh, little one. Do you love your sister and the prince?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well then follow your heart! It will lead you to them! Now, where does the prince live?\" \"Oh, oh! He lives in the Vale of the Fairies! But I don't know where that is either!\" \"Do not worry! I, Jacquimo, will find it, and bring him home to you!\" \"Oh, it's impossible,\" she sighs sadly. \"Impossible?\" Jacquimo asks, jumping off the rock he stood on. \"Nothing is impossible! You're sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart! Ha, ha! Your dreams will fly on magical wings, When you follow your heart!\" The jitterbug children start pulling Thumbelina along after Jacquimo, who is soon joined by some female birds as well. \" If you have to journey far, Here's a little trick. You don't need a guiding star. Trust your ticker, Get there quicker! You're sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart!\" Thumbelina looked up as Jacquimo flew onto two roses covered in morning dew. \"Come on Thumbelina! You are going home! Your mother is waiting! Get up, get up!\" Chickadees began singing along with Jacquimo, as Thumbelina skipped along the path between them. \"You're sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart! Your dreams will fly on magical wings.\" \"Sing, my little chickadees!\" \"When you follow your heart!\" \"North or South or East or West, Where to point your shoes? Which direction is the best? If the choosing gets confusing, Maybe its the map you're using. You don't need a chart to guide you, Close your eyes and look inside you! Ha ha!\" Taking Jacquimo's wing, Thumbelina danced down the book, her spirit returned. \"You're sure to do impossible things, If you know where to start!\" \"Ha ha!\" Your dreams will fly on magical wings, When you follow-\" \"Just trust the swallow!\" \"And always follow, your heart!\" The creatures around her began cheering as Li'l Bee, Gnatty, and Baby Bug pulled her along. \"Bon voyage, Thumbelina! Never fear! I will find the prince!\" Jacquimo declares, before flying away. \"He's wonderful! And, I'm going home!\" Turning around, Thumbelina disappeared into the grass with the jitterbabies.[Chapter 6] Hello Roseflame Crystalheart! Sorry for taking so long to write this specific chapter, but this story has just hit a huge obstacle: swim team. Most likely I will be sparsely updating here and there until after early November when sectionals ends. Also sorry that this is a short chapter. Well, it is compared to the last two. Still, I hope you enjoy it anyway! Chapter 5 Meanwhile at a location downstream, Ivalyn pulled herself onto the shore, coughing up water. \"Thumbelina. Must get to Thumbelina.\" She said weakly, before looking up as a shadow loomed over her. \"My, my. What in the world are you?\" A spider said, baring its fangs in a smile. Her eyes widening, Ivalyn scrambled away from the creature, looking for something to defend herself with. Spotting a sharp rock shard, she pointed it at the spider. \"S-stay back.\" \"Oh, I'm so sorry dearie. Did I scare you?\" The spider asked, extending two of it's arms in a placating gesture. Seeing the spider wasn't attacking, Ivalyn hesitantly lowered the rock shard. \"I apologize, young one. I forget that my pincers can look a little disconcerting when I smile.\" Realizing she had made a mistake, Ivalyn dropped the rock shard, and dipped into a curtsy. \"No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have judged you on your appearance.\" She smiled at the spider, before realizing she forgot to introduce herself. \"Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Ivalyn. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" \"Oh why its lovely to meet you dearie. My name is Isolde Spinnster, but everyone just calls me Grandma Izzy. Might I ask why you were swimming in the river?\" Ivalyn blinked, before remembering what she was doing before she met Grandma Izzy. \"Oh no. Thumbelina! It was very nice meeting you Grandma Izzy, but I have to go make sure my sister is okay. You see, I have to make sure we both get home, because Cornelius and Chrysantanthos said they would visit us this morning, and-\" \"Cornelius and Chrysanthos?\" Grandma Izzy interrupted. \"As in the Princes of the Fairy Court?\" \"Why yes, that's them! The two of them visited me and my sister last night, and promised to come this morning, but then Mrs. Toad kidnapped us and tried to make Thumbelina marry her son Grundel, even though Thumbelina said she loves Cornelius!\" \"That wasn't very nice at all. And not smart either. Those who stand in the way of true love will never succeed. Although, is it true love that you possess? Or merely a blind infatuation? That is the true question, is it not?\" Blinking, Ivalyn tried to wrap her head around what Grandma Izzy had just said. The feelings she had for Chrysanthos, were merely infatuation? Then what about Thumbelina's feelings? \"Ah, but what am I saying,\" Grandma Izzy continued, blind to Ivalyn's internal conflict. \"You were telling me about getting kidnapped by toads. How exactly did you escape from them?\" \"Well, they went off to get their father, and left the two of us on a lily pad. We couldn't cut it, but then a nice sparrow named Jacquimo clipped the root with his beak. So we started paddling towards the shore, only to realize that the stream was carrying us toward a waterfall. A bunch of creatures tried to help us get to safety, but in the process, I fell over the waterfall. Now I have no idea where I am, or if my sister is safe! My entire life has been turned upside down in less than a day!\" Collasping on her tired legs, Ivalyn blinked rapidly, trying to keep her tears unshed. Suddenly she felt four spindly arms wrap around her in a comforting embrace. \"Shhhh. There there, dearie. Just take a deep breath and try to calm down.\" Ivalyn followed Grandma Izzy's instructions, until she couldn't feel tears pricking her eyes anymore. \"Now then, why don't you come home with me. You're soaking wet, and I have some clothes that might fit you. I'll contact some friends and ask them to keep an eye out for your sister. Now does that sound okay?\" Numbly, Ivalyn nodded, and followed Grandma Izzy into the tall grass towards her home. At the same time, far away in the Vale of the Fairies, the royal family was talking. \"Cornelius, Chrysanthos,\" Queen Tabitha started. \"My sunshines, first you buzzed in here the other day on those wretched things, and announced in front of the entire court that you had found the girls of your dreams. And now you come back to say they've vanished?\" \"Kidnapped, Mother,\" Cornelius corrects flying up to her. \"They've been kidnapped.\" \"You're joking!\" \"Tabitha-\" King Colbert tried to support his sons case, when Chrysanthos flew over. \"Look Father,\" he said, obviously frustrated. \"Please delay the winter frost as long as you can. Cornelius and I need time to find Ivalyn and Thumbelina.\" \"Chrysanthos!\" The queen cried out as her son hopped onto his dragonfly and flew off. \"Don't worry, Mother, we'll be back,\" Cornelius says determined, jumping onto Buzzby. \"Cornelius!\" The royal parents cry out in unison as he flies off. \"We'll find them!\" \"Oh, my poor boys,\" Tabitha sighs. \"They're serious. I've never seen Chrysanthos so agitated about anything. But, Colbert, my love, we can't delay the frost for more than a day!\" At a place upstream from both of the sisters' locations, the Singers de Espana's showboat floated. Grundel balanced on the rim of the boat, looking extremely depressed as he traced circles in the water. \"Hey, bro!\" Mozo draws the curtain going backstage aside, smirking at his brother. \"Go away!\" Grundel immediately responds, only for Mozo to ignore his request and strut outside with Gringo close behind. \"Pond talk says Thumbelina gave you the slip, and is gonna marry a fairy prince!\" The two brother mock Grundel, who sits up, interested in the new information. \"What fairy prince?\" \"Oh ho ho! You not be able to show your ugly face on stage no more!\" Mozo teases him. \"Everybody laugh at you!\" Gringo adds. \"Nobody laugh!\" Grundel says angrily, only for his brothers to burst into laughter, angering him more. \"I said, nobody laughs!\" Pulling on their collars, he tries to get the guffawing brothers to be quiet, but they only continue, fanning the flames of his anger. \"I go get Thumbelina, and bring her back!\" He declares passionately, only for the brothers to launch into another bout of laughter. Grabbing them both by the scruff of their necks, he tosses them into the air. \"Whoa!\" The brothers both say, before continuing to laugh; even as they splashed into the water. \"I marry her!\" Grundel says determinedly, before hopping off, splashing into the stream a few times as his brothers laughter echoes behind him. Hope you liked that! I tried to do my best with Ivalyn's beginning. I don't want her to overshadowed by her sister for the rest of the story.[Chapter 7] Well, that took longer than expected. Swim team is a little harder than I remember. I'm so sore that it hurts to sit down! Anyway, hope you guys enjoy the chapter! Chapter 6 Humming along to the song Jacquimo had sung, Thumbelina and the jitterbabies continued through the grass, now only meters away from the wall marking the edge of her house. \"Look out!\" Baby Bug suddenly cried in fright, and the jitterbabies zoomed into the grass to hide. \"Ha ha!\" A tall black beetle landed in front of Thumbelina, causing her to scream in fright. Continuing to laugh for a moment the beetle turned to face Thumbelina with a smirk on his face. \"Hiya, toots! Beetle's my name, and razzmatazz is my game. How do you do, everything okay?\" Sliding up to her, one of his antennae tickled her face. \"I'm not your toots!\" Thumbelina replied, backing up to try and get this stranger out of her personal space. \"Where did you come from?\" \"Where? Up there!\" Beetle pointed to the sky with a flambouyant gesture, before spinning to lean on a nearby toadstool. \"I'm a connoisseur of sweet nectars, a designer of rare threads, and a judge of beautiful women!\" Grabbing Thumbelina by the waist, he spun her around. \"And you, are beautiful, Miss...?\" \"Um, uh Thumbelina,\" she replied, batting his antennae out of her face again. \"And I'm going home.\" Walking away, she suddenly stopped as Beetle zoomed in front of her. \"What's your hurry toots? Relax. Take a load off.\" \"Ugh! I wish you wouldn't do that,\" Thumbelina pushes his antennae out of his face again, annoyed. \"Perhaps you'd prefer this?\" He asked, before grabbing her wrist, and kissing up her arm. \"Ah!\" Thumbelina gasped in shock. \"Mr. Beetle! I don't even know you! Would you stop?!\" \"Stop? How can I stop?!\" He cried dramatically, gesturing about wildly. \"I'm crazy about you, toots! You're gorgeous!\" Thumbelina begins to blush and giggle slightly at the praise, and doesn't notice as one of Beetle's kisses miss her hand and land on his own. \"Oh!\" He perks up, beginning to kiss his own hand. \"You're exciting! Delicious!\" \"I am?\" Thumbelina asks, oblivious to the fact Beetle was now talking about himself. \"And, I love the sound of your voice!\" \"My voice?\" \"Don't talk! Sing. Sing to me.\" They wait in silence for a moment, before Thumbelina's eyes light up, and she turns to the blue bug. \" I have an idea! Can you fly me up there ?\" She points up to an oak, towering high above them. \"Um, why should I, toots?\" \"Well, from the treetops I could see my house. Then I'd know if I'm traveling in the right direction to get home.\" \"Gee... I don't know.\" Beetle smirked as he cast the bait. \"That would be a big, big, oh, very big favor.\" \"I'll sing. I'll sing for you.\" And hook, line, and sinker. \"No, no. You'll sing at the Beetle Ball! And dance!\" Without waiting for her reply, he threw the young girl over his shoulder and flew up to the entrance to the Beetle Caves. \"Ha, ha! We are gonna be the talk of the town, toots!\" \"I'm not your toots! And I don't even look like a Beetle!\" And with that, they vanished into the caves. Far below them, the three young jitterbabies emerged from their hiding place. \"Come on,\" Li'l Bee said to the others. \"Let's get help.\" Far away from the Beetle Caves, Grandma Izzy was in a room, weaving a lovely dress from her own spider silk in only seconds. \"Here, dearie,\" she said, slipping the dress past a leaf covering a cave adjoining the one she used as a home. \"Thank you, Grandma Izzy,\" a soft voice replied from behind the leaf. \"No need to thank me, dearie. Please, if there's anything else I can do for you, please, let me know.\" Settling into a worn rocking chair across the room, Grandma Izzy began to weave another spider silk item. \"Um, how do I look?\" A tentative voice asked, as the leaf moved aside. Grandma Izzy looked up, and beamed as Ivalyn stepped out. She wore the white spider silk dress that Grandma Izzy made for her, which had a double layered skirt, and long sleeves. She had ditched her delicate green slippers, and donned sturdy brown boots, with warm cattail lining. Her long hair had been tightly woven into a braid, which swayed behind her. Shining on her left ring finger was a gold ring, with a blue stone in the center. The same ring Chrysanthos had given her before he left. \"Oh, why don't you just look as lovely as a blooming rose!\" The seamstress cried happily. \"And that dress should keep out the cold of winter. You'll be able to go out and look for your sister.\" \"Oh, thank you so much!\" Ivalyn cried, rushing forward to hug the elderly spider. \"Though, I was just wondering why you're helping me so much. Not that I don't appreciate all you kindness! You just seem really helpful for someone I've just met.\" Grandma Izzy sighed and put down the item she was weaving. \"It's because I've experienced what you're going through. \"Long ago, I also had a sister who I lived with. I had hundreds of other sisters, but Emilia is the only one who stayed with me. She protected me, and I provided for the two of us with my weaving. Believe it or not, she was a terrible seamstress. She couldn't even spin a web! But her skills as a warrior surpassed that of everyone we met. Everyone except King Trython of the Faeries.\" \"The Fairy King? Isn't that Chrysanthos' father?\" \"No, not Fairy, Faerie. While the Fairies are kind and good hearted, the Faeries are cold, dark creatures who use shadow magic. Their king, Trython, is especially cruel, and hearing of my sister's skill, he challenged her to a duel. My sister was not one to back down from a challenge, and so accepted. The two of them fought, and my sister won. But Trython, refusing to let it be known that a girl had beaten him, struck her when her back was turned. I was there, and seeing this, I took my sister's sword and escaped the place while I could. \"So yes, I also known the feeling of missing your other half. Of missing your own sister.\" \"That's-\" Ivalyn started, only for her voice to break. \"That's just so terrible.\" \"Yes. Actually, there's something more I can do.\" Getting up, Grandma Izzy walked over to a large cabinet made of bark. Opening it she took something out, before turning around and handing Ivalyn a wrapped bundle. Slowing unwrapping the cloth, Ivalyn gasped as she saw a sword, sheathed in a scabbard attached to a belt. \"Is this...?\" \"Yes. It's my sister's sword. You remind me of her, you know. It's like I'm talking to Emilia again.\" \"But I couldn't possibly take this!\" \"No. Use it on your journey. It'll be of more use to you than it is to me. I assume you know how to wield a blade, seeing how you're going through the basic stances.\" \"Yeah, I have a little expierience with blades.\" Ivalyn replied as she swung around the glistening silver blade. \"Excellent balance. This must have been made by a master.\" \"Yes, it was. But that's a story for another day.\" \"I'm going to head out and look for 'Lina.\" Stepping close to Grandma Izzy, Ivalyn hugged the sweet seamtress who had helped her get this far. \"Thank you for all of your help Grandma Izzy.\" Strapping the sword on so that the hilt peeked over her right shoulder, Ivalyn waved back at the spider one last time before vanishing out the cave entrance. \"I swear, that girl could be Emilia reincarnated. They're so similar. Good luck, Ivalyn.\"[Chapter 8] Hope you guys appreciate this chapter. Wrote it all in one go, and right after a two hour swim practice. Anyway, just trying to get this story done with soon, because once school starts, the updates won't be coming very quickly. Chapter 7 Meanwhile down in the Beetle Ballroom of the Crystal Caves, dozens of beetles, big and small, were nodding along to the beat as entertainers in the center of the room danced and sang. In the middle of said stage, Thumbelina stood, disguised in a large and flashy butterfly costume. \"Ladies and gentlebugs,\" an announcers voice boomed from some unknown source. \"Berkley Beetle proudly presents Thumbelina!\" Said bug danced onto the stage dressed in black, accompanied by four other beetles wearing white. The beetles began to dance around, their synchronized movements showing how much they had obviously practiced, before Beetle took the lead and began to sing. \"Baby, its the Beetle Ball, And bugs are crawling to get in, When they hear that beetle beat, Their beetle feet'll start to spin! And how to cheer! For you, my dear Yer beautiful, baby!\" Thumbelina smiled at the praise as the crowd cheered, before the back ups began to sing. \" Oh my little butterfly, You flutter by at each romance, Every chance to dance with you, Puts the ants back in my pants! \" Dancing around, Thumbelina turned to face him as Beetle came up next to her dancing. \" Let's cut a rug, My ladybug, Yer beautiful, baby !\" Beetle led Thumbelina down to the main stage before he took over the singing again. \"I get a buzz when I have you on my wing, You have my antennae in a knot! Now the room's reelin', And I'm feelin', So ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, Hot to trot! Let's dance, baby!\" Beetle went off doing some very unique dance moves as Thumbelina watched him. \"Isn't she beautiful!\" A green beautiful thoughtless comments to his wife. \"Just adorable, darling,\" she says back gazing at the show through opera glasses. \"What a piece of work!\" Another beetle comments, making his date glare at him. \"Will ya look at 'er?\" Their waiter agrees. \"Okay, toots! Let's wing it!\" Beetle tells Thumbelina, too overjoyed to think clearly. Thumbelina however, didn't have that problem. \"I-I can't wing it! I don't even have wings!\" Her protests go unheard, and as Beetle spins her, her costume rips off, revealing her wearing a red one piece leotard with black trimming underneath. \"I'm getting dizzy!\" \"Ew!\" The crowd cries in disgust at seeing Thumbelina's non insectoid appearance. Thumbelina shrinks in on herself as the crowd jeers at her. The singers begin incorporating their laughter into the song. \"Hee hee hee hee, Ha ha ha ha! She's she's she's she's, So so so so- Hey, that bug is a dog!\" Thumbelina tries to continue dancing the routine, but the audience begins commenting on her. \"My, my!\" \"Unattractive!\" \"The word, my dear, is ugly!\" \"She's so ugly it hurts my feelers!\" \"I hope it ain't catching!\" \"Disgraceful!\" Thumbelina keeps dancing, smile on face, seemingly oblivious to the crowd's comments. But then the singers pitch in, directly next to her. \" Would you look at that, She ain't got no wings! Good gracious, me, What are those things?\" Thumbelina begins frowning in confusion and embarrassment at the words, her dancing coming to a stop. \" She ain't got no feelers!\" \"No feelers!\" The crowd responds. \"She ain't got no shell!\" \"Do tell!\" \"She's got scrawny legs, And knobbly knees, For all we know, The gal's got fleas! (AN: Yes, of course she has fleas, which I might add, ARE THE SAME SIZE AS SHE IS!) She can't even fly, No that won't do,\" at this Beetle frowns and starts getting angry. \"So say goodbye, She's not for you!\" \"I'm sorry toots,\" Beetle tells Thumbelina, annoyed that his fame had apparently vanished. \"I guess you're too-\" \"Ugly!\" Everyone in the crowd cries, as Beetle hits Thumbelina on the butt with his cane. Thumbelina's hands fly up, before she sinks down, visibly saddened by the crowd's comments. \"Don't worry, you'll get over me,\" Beetle tells her before tipping his hat and walking away. \"I'm ugly?\" Thumbelina repeats sadly, looking like she was about to cry. Far away, the jitterbabies were running along the ground, Gnatty and Li'l Bee leaving Baby Bug trying to catch up to them. \"Hey, wait for me!\" The distressed bug cried, trying in vain to catch up to the other two. \"Hurry up! Thumbelina needs help!\" Li'l Bee responded, as they ran toward a dead tree stump. As they passed through, a large figure dropped down and blocked their way out. It was Grundel de Espana, who had overheard them say Thumbelina's name. Screaming, the jitterbabies ran back the way they came. Seeing them try to escape, Grundel merely laughed, before pounding on the stump, causing wood to fall, blocking the jitterbabies exit. \"Do I hear one of you say Thumbelina needs help?\" \"Yes.\" \"Gnatty!\" Li'l Bee cried at him, remembering an important lesson that Gnatty, Baby Bug, Thumbelina, and Ivalyn all didn't know, but he did. Stranger danger. \"The beetle took her, and flew her way up there.\" \"Shhh! Be quiet!\" Li'l Bee whispered, covering Gnatty's mouth before he said anything else. \"The beetle?\" Grundel questioned, before smashing the ground with his hand again. \"I want her back!\" The jitterbabies screamed again as wood rained down, and they quickly ran through Grundel's legs, sprinting towards the exit. \"Come on, let's go!\" Baby Bug yelled as they escaped, but Li'l Bee couldn't help throwing one last insult over their shoulders. \"You big, ugly wart face!\" Hearing this, Grundel laughed insanely, before catching himself. \"Now, we see about this beetle!\"[Chapter 9] Alright, this chapter is a bit longer. Hope you enjoy! Chapter 9 Thumbelina sat on a fungus, back in her original clothing with her knees pulled to her chest. Her head lifted up as she heard singing, very faint singing, but extremely familiar. \"You're sure sure to do impossible things, If you follow your heart, Your sure to fly on magical wings, If you follow your heart.\" Jacquimo landed down on the fungus next to Thumbelina. \"Why, what is ze matter, Thumbelina,\" he asked frowning, looking at her tear streaked face. \"I'm cold. I'm lost. And I'm hungry. And the beetle says I'm ugly !\" She sniffled again, more tears cascading down her face. \"Ze beetle?\" Jacquimo smiles as he helps her up. \"Do you love ze beetle?\" \"No.\" \"Zhen never mind ze beetle. Good riddance to ze beetle. And good riddance to ze toad!\" Pausing to blow away the dandelion next to Thumbelina, Jacquimo leaves one seedling with dew left. \"Does Prince Cornelius think you are ugly?\" \"No,\" Thumbelina smiles, wiping at her eyes. \"He thinks I'm beautiful.\" \"And so you are, mon amie. Look,\" he turns her so she's looking into the dew droplet. Looking into the little droplet, Thumbelina sees herself smiling prettily. \"I'm going home,\" she whispers to the wind. Her confidence restored. \"Jacquimo?\" \"Hmm?\" The bird was settling down to sleep by the tree, and Thumbelina crawled over to join him. \"Will you find the Vale of the Fairies?\" \"I promise. Yawn . I promise. But now we must sleep.\" \"Thank you, Jacquimo. Thank you.\" \"Tomorrow is a new day. And I will go to ze forest and see if I can find your Prince Cornelius.\" Back at the Beetle Ballroom, many insects were still there, and enjoying themselves happily, gossiping about Thumbelina. \"Can you believe how ugly she was?\" \"Sure wasn't a beetle, I know that much!\" \"She didn't have any wings, so she can't be a fairy.\" \"What do you suppose she was?\" Suddenly the doors opened, and a white cloaked figure walked calmly inside, a silver blade flashing on their back. Immediately the room took notice, for they recognized the visitor was wearing spider silk. Only two kinds of people wore spider silk; the good friends of spiders, or the very, very rich people. The figure paused near the middle of the room, before walking up to a waiter. Said waiter curiously tried to look underneath the cloak, but the flickering lights of the room distorted the shadows too much to let him see who it was. \"Excuse me, but I've heard from a reliable source that a girl named Thumbelina performed here recently. Is that rumor true?\" The voice coming from the visitor was high pitched and obviously female, but it had an undertone of danger to it, which made a shiver crawl up the waiter's spine. \"Yeah. The girl performed here last night, but the crowd didn't really like how ugly she was, so I doubt she'll perform here again.\" A fellow waiter answered the mysterious girl, swaggering with bravado that had to have come with his hulking height. \"Ugly?\" The cloaked girl asked slowly, but with obvious anger, which the tall waiter didn't notice, despite his friends warning nods. \"Yeah, the chick was pretty disgusting. She didn't have any feelers or wings, or even a shell! I don't know what she must have been thinking, showing her face on stage like that. Disgraceful.\" \"Uh huh... I see... So she was disgusting because she had no feelers, no wings, and no shell.\" The figure said thoughtfully, before turning to leave. \"Well, since I doubt you beetles know where such an ugly person has gone, I'm going to find someone who does. Maybe I can ask my spider friends. But wait, they don't have feelers or wings. Guess that makes them too ugly to talk to. Or maybe I can ask one of my fairy friends. But no , they don't have any shells. Oh, I know! I can go ask one of the birds! But they don't have feelers or shells! Since I have no one else to talk to. I guess I'll just have to talk to an ugly person anyway. \"Of course, I'll be sure to tell them all about what you said about them.\" The beetles all freeze. If the spiders-or heavens forbid the fairies, self-righteous snobs that they were-they wouldn't get any spider silk for seasons! Maybe even years! The tall waiter from before walked over to the cloaked girl menacingly. \"Then I guess that means we can't let you tell them!\" He roared, leaping towards the girl, intending to hit her unconscious, only for her to dodge out of the way. Turning to face her again he punched forward, only for her to slide under his punch and kick him in the stomach. Doubling over at the waist, he coughed, only for the warrior to bang the hilt of her sword against the top of his head, and knocked him unconscious. \"Anyone else want to try that?\" The warrior asked the stunned audience quietly, before sheathing her sword and walking calmly out the exit. Immediately the ballroom burst into chatter. \"Who in the world was that?\" \"Did you see how fast she defeated Binkley?\" \"Man, sure don't want to get on her bad side.\" \"She was like a white knight!\" \"No, a angelic warrior!\" \"Did you hear that? If we don't stop calling people ugly, she'll bring the fairy court down on us!\" \"The way she took that guy out, it was almost as if she was dancing!\" As she left the Crystal Caves, Ivalyn hmphed angrily. \"How dare they call my sister ugly! What a bunch of snobbish, rude idiots! Alright then. Next stop, the forest.\" In said forest, a hare ran fearfully away from a fox, who was trying to get his dinner. Momentarily catching the hare's foot, the fox grinned, only to get slammed into the earth as the hare shook him off. \"Bonjour!\" Jacquimo greeted the hare, flying up in front of her and landing on her face. \"A nice sunny day, hmm?\" \"It's sunny all right, but I'm not too sure about the nice.\" The hare looked back at the fox, while simultaniously dashing across a log bridging a crack in the ground. \"I am looking for ze Vale of ze Fairies.\" \"Fairies, huh? Beats the heck out of me! Why don't you go ask a fairy!\" \"Oh! You know one?\" \"No, but he might!\" The hare replied, seeing a way to distract her pursuer. \"Oh, ah! Merci!\" Jacquimo thanked, before flying off to land on the fox's face. \"Ah, excusez-moi, monseiur. I am looking for ze Vale of ze-\" \"Am-scray!\" The fox interrupted, ripped the swallow off his face, only for said swallow to grab on to his mouth, and sit inside it while asking his questions. \"I can see at zis moment you are a very busy fox, so I will be brief.\" \"Buzz off buster!\" The fox said, flinging Jacquimo out of his mouth with his tongue, causing the bird to fly into a thorn-bush. Plummeting down, he looked in shock at the thorn impaling his wing. \"Look! Look what-what I do! I have a thorn, in my wing! Oh, zis is bad. Zis is very bad! Mon dieu, I hope I can-I still can fly!\" Flapping upwards, Jacquimo flies up to the top of the thornbush he was impaled by. \"I fly! I fly, oh merci! It only stings a little! Now, where was I?\" Suddenly, the leaves on the trees near him blacken and fall off. \"Autumn. It is Autumn! Oh, I must hurry to find ze fairy prince! Winter is almost here!\" The two princes flew side by side in a gale helmets on, and fighting against the wind. \"Thumbelina!\" \"Ivalyn! Where are you!\" Chrysanthos calls, only to be knocked off Sniper by the wind, and land in a mud puddle. Sitting up he pulled off his helmet, and wiped the mud off his face with a scowl. \"Come on, Chrysanthos! Get up,\" Cornelius yelled at his brother, as Sniper scooped him back up, and they continued through the gale. Landing at a log that marked the entrance to the jitterbug's caves, the brothers dismounted their respective mounts. \"We're-We're looking for two beautiful young sisters. Their names are Thumbelina and Ivalyn,\" Cornelius said to the gathered jitterbugs. \"Are you the fairy princes?\" Gnatty asked hopefully. \"We are.\" Chrysanthos confirmed, kneeling down to speak on the same level as the jitterbaby. \"Thumbelina's and Ivalyn are gone.\" \"Gone? Where? Where did they go?\" Cornelius asked urgently. \"It's not quite so simple, Your Highnesses,\" Amilia, a butterfly jitterbug told them. \"You see when they were kidnapped by the toads, we helped them escape, but in the rescue Ivalyn fell over a waterfall. No one has seen her since.\" \"No.\" Chrysanthos breathed out. \"No, not Ivalyn. No, she can't be gone!\" \"I'm so sorry, Chrysanthos,\" Cornelius comforted his brother. \"But, what about Thumbelina, where is she?\" \"The beetle took her away,\" Gnatty told him. \"What?\" \"They're out there, somewhere,\" Amilia confirmed. \"She's out there? In that?\" Cornelius turned, looking at the distructive weather outside. \"There's a big toad after her too!\" Gnatty added. \"Oh no. I've got to find her, Winter is almost here!\" Putting his helmet back on, he turned to find Chrysanthos staring at him determined. \"I lost my chance to find love. I won't let you lose yours!\" Hopping back on their insects, the princes set out again, Cornelius pulling ahead. \"Hurry Buzz, my father can't hold back the frost much longer!\" Chrysanthos followed behind him, his hand going to a twinkling gold ribbon which was tied around his neck. \"I promise I'll find your sister, Ivalyn. I swear it upon my life.\"[Chapter 10] Hey, guys! I'll make this AN brief, but thought I'd let you all know that I recently got accepted to a college! So in celebration, I decided to write, only to realize that I haven't updated this for OVER A YEAR. Which is kinda sad, because I really like this story, out of all the ones I've written. So, I've decided to set a goal for myself, and finish this story by the summer! Wish me luck! Chapter 10 In a dark, decaying part of the forest, Grundel was attempting to strangle Beetle to death. \"Okay, okay!\" Beetle gasped, coughing loudly. \"Can-Can I explain something?\" \"What?!\" Grundel snapped angrily. \"Look, I don't. Know. Where. She. Is. We didn't hit it off too good. So I uh, I let her go. She's not my type. She's an ugly type. I don't like ugly.\" \"She is beautiful!\" Grundel yelled, hitting Beetle on the head, and then stepping on his foot. \"Whatever you say,\" Beetle gasped, trying to free his foot. Grundel lifted his own foot up condescendingly, letting Beetle stand. \"Look, I got an idea,\" Beetle said, back in his con-man personna. \"I hear that she loves the fairy prince, right?\" \"I crush fairy prince,\" Grundel said angrily smashing his fists together, after pounding Beetle into the ground. \"Okay, okay. Shut up and listen!\" Beetle stood up, straightening his mustache. \"Why don't you just nab this prince and you set up a trap for the girl, using him as the bait. You know, get her to come to you.\" \"Nab the prince?\" Grundel rubbed his chin, contemplating the idea. \"And set up a trap.\" \"Nab the prince!\" \"Yes. Nab the prince and set up a trap! Do you speak English?!\" Beetle yelled, grabbing Grundel's collar and shaking him. \"Try to keep up, Grundel, okay?\" \"Don't shout!\" Grundel shouted, pulling his hat down over his face. \"You're making me very nervous here!\" \"You, go capture prince.\" Grundel grabbed Beetle, and ripped off his wings. \"Ah! My wings! You took my wings! You can't do that!\" Beetle screamed, jumping to try and get them back. \"Yeah? I keep wings until you nab prince.\" Angrily, Beetle grabbed the arm that was holding him, and looked at the toad angrily. \"Listen, pal, this harassment has gone far enough, and I know my rights! I'll report you to the pond patrol!\" Grundel's hand went back around Beetle's neck, and immediately the bug lost all his previous anger. \"Okay, okay. Cool it, cool it.\" The toad dropped Beetle down, but kept his fist raised threateningly. \"Where's your sense of humor?\" Grundel's fist positioned itself by Beetle's head. \"All right! I'll nab the prince. Come on guys! Mind the wings. I'll be back.\" Grundel began smiling, as Beetle and his hiding back up dancers started leaving to do his dirty work. Far away, in a distant part of the forest, a bear slept soundly in its cave, the leaves around it rustling with each breath. He wore a striped night cap, and clutched a jug of honey close to his chest. Silently, Jacquimo flew in, and landed on a rock near the bear's head. \"Ah, excuse-moi, Monsieur Bear?\" Jacquimo loudly asked, causing the bear to stir and sleepily turn to face him, his eyes still closed. \"I am looking for ze Vale of ze Fairies-\" \"I don't want no berries,\" the bear interrupted, having misheard the swallow. \"No, no, no,\" Jacquimo lifted the eyelid closest to him to look the bear in the eye. \" Fair -ies! Not, bear -ies!\" Despite his attempts to get the bear to focus on him however, the bear just kept snoring, causing Jacquimo to become quite upset. Firmly grabbing the bear's ear, he shouted as loud as he could. \"WAKE UP YOU BIG LUMOX!\" This finally got the bear's attention, and he immediately sat up, causing Jacquimo to lose his balance and fall into the honey jug with an indignant \" Oof !\" \"I said, WAKE UP!\" The swallow continued, unaware that the bear was, at this point, very much awake. Seeing the cause of his current aggravation, the bear rolled his eyes and with a strong swipe of his paw, batted the honey jug out of the cave. He then settled back down to return to his hibernation. The honey jug flew through the air, before crashing into a tree and breaking. The shards fell down to the ground, and moans and groans echoed from the wreckage, as Jacquimo made his displeasure known. \"I am having, a very bad day.\" Dizzily clambering out of the intact top of the jug, he sat down on the rim. \"Mon dieu! It is so cold!\" An icicle suddenly fell on his head, and Jacquimo looked up, to see the branches of the tree becoming coated with ice. Looking at the ground around him, he saw what he had missed before while distracted by his pain. Frost covered the leaves around him, even as more icicles stretched down around him. \"Winter! Winter is here!\" Jacquimo breathed out, shocked, only for a strong gust of cold air to blow him off into a building storm. Snow swirled around him, as the swallow flapped his wings, trying to gain even a modicum of control, only to feel a stabbing pain from his left wing. \"Oh, this thorn!\" Jacquimo cried out. \"Oh, it hurts to fly!\" The storm winds drowned out his cries, as the swallow was swept away with the snow. Nearby, hail began to fall down around the two fairy princes, who were flying through the nearly bare branches of the trees on their respective mounts. \"Don't worry Buzz! We're gonna make it!\" Cornelius reassured his panicked bee, even as his brother kept calling out into the storm. \"Thumbelina!\" It was becoming increasingly difficult to see, and eventually Cornelius crashed through a leaf, temporarily blinding him and Buzzby, causing them to spiral down towards the forest floor. With a curse, Chrysanthos nudged Sniper into a dive, and zoomed after his brother. Cornelius was able to level out of his uncontrolled fall, but his momentum was too great for him to stop, and Buzzby crashed down. Skidding through the snow on the ground, Buzzby abruptly came to a stop, throwing Cornelius from his back and into a pond of icy water covered in a thin layer of ice. \"Cornelius!\" Chrysanthos yelled, his eyes wide with horror. Diving off of Sniper's back, he plunged into the water after his brother, grabbing his hand and pulling him up. They had almost breached the surface of the water, Cornelius stretching out his hand, only for the water to freeze around them. The flower necklace Thumbelina had given Cornelius blew over the ice, only for the wind to rip it apart. The storm continued to rage, leaving the princes trapped, with a single finger of Cornelius's hand sticking out of the ice. Ivalyn ran through the storm, her sense of direction completely gone, trying in vain to find a place to take shelter. After leaving the beetles, she had returned to talk with Grandma Izzy who had reported in that her neighbors' brothers' best friend had seen someone matching Thumbelina's description near the mole hills in the forest. So Ivalyn had gone off once again to look for her missing sister, only for the storm to suddenly spring up out of nowhere as she was looking. Her cloak flapped wildly around her, as the wind continued to rage. She climbed over a rock, only to trip and fall down the other side, landing in a pile of leaves. Climbing to her feet she looked around, trying in vain to find something, anything that could help her. It was then that she saw it. A layer of glittering white advancing towards her. The frost. Running off in the opposite direction, she struggled across the leaves of the forest floor, as the storm battered her cold form. Daughter of Barleycorn. She stopped. What was that? Come, Daughter of Barleycorn. She found her feet running towards the voice, a sound she didn't know, yet which resonated in her in such an achingly familiar way it made her want to cry. She suddenly came face to face with a tree, the biggest tree she had ever seen. It was more than twice the size of the plum tree by her mother's house, and three times as tall. From the trunk in front of her, a hand melted out of the bark, pale and inviting. Ivalyn hesitated, biting her lip. She had no idea what she was getting into, or what that hand belonged to. Then again, it was her only escape from the frost. Take my hand. Looking back, for a moment, she saw that the frost was only seconds away. Taking a deep breath, she turned and grabbed the hand, and was pulled into the tree. A moment later, the frost covered the bark, and winter descended.[Chapter 11] Hey guys! Here's the next chapter! Hope you enjoy! Berkley Beetle was not in a good mood. He was cold, and tired, and his wings were being held hostage by a toad. And now, he had to go capture the fairy princes. On foot . Now normally such a feat would be impossible; after all, fairies were some of the fastest fliers around, and each of them was backed by the protection of the Fairy Court. Such a thing made it nearly impossible to attack or capture a fairy and get away with it. But now it was winter. The fairies would be hiding in their little Vale, safe inside their flowers, and so the threat of the Court was weakened. Of course, rather than being directly in the Vale, the princes were apparently out somewhere in the woods. Alone, and without any protection; for although the princes were known for their aptitude with the sword, Berkley had all his beetle henchmen to back him up. All of this, creating the perfect situation for them to capture the princes. Now if only he actually had his wings! \"See now; now he takes my wings away, now I have to walk to find the princes.\" Behind him, two of his men notice a dark shape underneath the ice of the pond they were walking by. \"See, if he let me keep my wings, I could fly after the princes, and bring them back in two seconds!\" As Berkley complained, Bradley, one of the beetles with him, used his arm to clear some of the snow residue off the ice, making it clearer. Seeing Cornelius and Chrysanthos' faces staring back at him, he turned excitedly to his boss. \"Hey Beetle! These guys are the princes!\" \"The princes?...Ah! THE PRINCES!\" He cried gleefully, as his beetles began cutting the frozen fairies out. What luck! Now he could get these two back to that stupid toad, get his wings back, and then huddle up somewhere warm with a glass of nectar mead. \"Somebody up there loves me! The princes-\" Hopping up onto the cube of ice that his beetles had lugged up from the lake, he began directing them. \"Okay, okay, you pick them up. Let's get outta this stinkin' weather before we're statistics! Hoo! I can't even feel anything in my feeler's anymore. A guy with my brains, I gotta talk to a toad . What kinda-what kinda conversation can you have with a toad ?\" Berkley raised an eyebrow at the slightly offended look Bradley was throwing in his direction. (This was due to the fact that Bradley was actually fairly good friends with a toad, who he had tea with once a week.) \"What? They're toads ; they're green, they're toads-\" Yes, Berkley Beetle's fortune was beginning to look up. Thumbelina was cold . Shivering, she continued walking through the snowy grass. Ever since Jacquimo had left her to go and find the Vale of Fairies, she had been wandering through the forest, trying in vain to find her house. Autumn had been fine, as with the harvest there were plenty of berries and seeds she could find to keep herself from starving. But now with winter, not only had it become dangerously cold; all of the berries had shriveled, and the seeds had been buried under a layer of frost and ice. Oddly enough though, she didn't feel hungry, despite the fact that she hadn't eaten for at least a day. Oh, if only Jacquimo had known where she lived! Then she could have just asked him to fly her back home. But by the time they had met, the toads had sailed so far away from her house that none of the jitterbugs had even known where her house was. And after everything that had happened with the beetle, Thumbelina had done her best to hide away whenever she encountered another creature. Shivering again, Thumbelina pushed aside some grass and stepped through, only to gasp as the dirt under her foot crumbled away, and she fell. Rolling over some rocks, she slid onto the ice of a pond- Splash! -And fell directly into freezing water, courtesy of a hole that Berkley Beetle had recently made when he found Cornelius and Chrysanthos. Climbing out quickly, Thumbelina shuddered and coughed as she got out. Now not only was she three times colder, her clothes and hair were weighed down with water. Tripping onto the snowy bank of the pond, she fell heavily. Slowly sitting up, she sat there, shivering and miserable and alone . Ever since her birth from her flower, she had never been alone. She had always had Mother and Ivalyn and Hero and the farm animals. But now, not even her sister was here beside her. Her wonderful, stubborn sister who had always looked out for her, and understood her like no one else ever had. Her sister who had fallen over a waterfall, and was out there, and alone just like Thumbelina. Jacquimo and the jitterbugs might think Ivalyn was dead, but something inside Thumbelina just knew that her sister was alive. And that was what kept her going; the hope that she would see Ivalyn again; the hope that she would find her home and Mother; the hope that Cornelius would come for her. But in the dark and cold winter weather, without even the sun to guide her, that hope was so small and tiny. Seeing something out of the corner of her eye, Thumbelina turned to look, and- Oh! An old boot was sitting there, on top of a hill, but it was the closest to shelter that Thumbelina could find. Scrambling up the hill desperately, she crawled inside the open hole in the front, and wrapped the old sock lying inside around her. \"Jacquimo was wrong. I will never find my way home. It's impossible. Oh Ivalyn, Mother, where can you be?\" Thumbelina curled into herself, sniffling and feeling smaller than she ever had before. Ivalyn blearily opened her eyes. She remembered grasping the hand, but then after that, nothing. Sitting up, she looked around the room she was in. It was small, with sloping wooden walls and glowing moss gently lighting the room. She was laying on a bed of leaves, soft and green as if in the midst of summer. Looking to her right, she froze at the sight of a woman sitting there. The woman was the same size as a fairy, but like Thumbelina and Ivalyn, she had no wings. A small part of Ivalyn wondered if perhaps that meant they were the same, and the woman would know why Thumbelina and her were small but wingless. The woman looked different from anyone Ivalyn had met yet, with tangled silver hair twining down over a blue dress. Her eyes were clear and blue-extremely bright in the dim lighting-and she was looking straight at her. \"Hello,\" the woman said, her mouth stretching into a comforting smile. Her voice was the same as the achingly familiar one that had come from the hand. Ivalyn hesitantly smiled back, and opened her mouth to say something, only to break into a coughing fit as she tried to speak. The woman held out a bowl of water, which Ivalyn gratefully accepted, gulping the clean water down her throat. After setting down the empty bowl on the bed next to her, Ivalyn turned back to the woman. \"Hello,\" she replied hesitantly. \"Um, if I may ask, who are you?\" The woman laughed heartily, Ivalyn flinching back from the sudden noise. Seeing this, the woman smiled gently and tilted her head slightly to the side. \"Oh, little nymph. There is no need to be nervous around me. I am Liliana, Daughter of the Lily Tree. You can call me Lili though. And what's your name?\" \"Oh! Why, um, my name is Ivalyn,\" the dark-haired girl awkwardly replied. \"It's nice to meet you?\" \"The pleasure is all mine,\" the woman, Lili's eyes curved up in amusement. \"It's not often I'm able to speak with others of my kind face to face. After all, it's rare to find a dryad willing to venture from her plant. Of course, that does bring up a question I have. What is a Daughter of Barleycorn doing so far from her flower during the frost?\" Wait, what? Ivalyn blinked in bewilderment. \"Um, sorry, but could you repeat that?\" \"Oh!\" Lili looked startled, a small blush gracing her cheeks as a hand flew up to cover her mouth. \"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to imply that you were weaker, just for being a Smallplant! I-Well, I mean what I was trying to say, you know, before I put my foot in my mouth, was that most nymphs just tend to stay in their plants during winter. Not that that's a bad thing! I mean, I stay in my tree during winter, because it's so gosh darned cold out there, so it's perfectly okay if other nymphs aren't good with the cold-or are good with it, in your case-including Smallplants.\" \"Um,\" Despite understanding most of the words that came out tumbling out of the woman's mouth, Ivalyn honestly had no idea what she was saying. \"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. What's a Smallplant?\" The question seemed to shock Lili, who reared back in surprise, before blinking and peering closely at Ivalyn. She fidgeted slightly, uncomfortable with the sudden scrutiny. Looking at her hands clasped in her lap, she shrunk in on herself. \"…Did I say something wrong?\" A hand at her chin lifted her face, sky blue meeting soft jade. \"No, no. You have done nothing wrong. However, I fear I've gotten ahead of myself, like usual . Tell me, what do you know about nymphs?\" Ivalyn blinked confusedly at the question, relaxing a bit now that she knew she wasn't in trouble. \"Nothing, to be honest. What is a nymph?\" Lili's cheeks blew up for a moment, before deflating with a sigh. Running a hand through her silver tresses, she took a long, bewildered look at Ivalyn. Letting out another sigh, she put her hands back in her lap. \"Okay, sorry, for me blundering ahead before. I kinda have a horrible habit of letting my mouth run way ahead of my brain. Um, oh geez, I really didn't think that I was going to have to give someone the talk when I woke up this morning. So, I guess the first thing to start with is, nymphs. That is, you are a nymph. A dryad, to be really specific, but nymph is the more common term.\" A nymph. Ivalyn thought to herself, finally having a name for what she was. \"You see, a nymph is what happens when a plant becomes something more than it should be. By that I mean that something super weird that isn't supposed to happen, happens. For example, this tree we are currently in grew when someone planted a lily flower in the ground, and it grew into a Lily Tree.\" Gesturing around at the room, Ivalyn realized that when the hand had pulled her away from the frost, it had literally pulled her inside of the bark. So that at least told her where she was. \"Now, as that plant grows, it eventually reaches a point where the thing that makes it different from others of its kind reaches maturity. In this case, that means when the lily that grew went from being a flower, to a tree. Bark grew, branches began spreading, and it was no longer a lily. So it became a nymph plant, with a nymph in it. That's me.\" Lili took a moment to wink at Ivalyn, who smiled at the show of good humor. \"But I wasn't born as I am now. I was formless-like a spirit that existed solely within this tree, with no way of interacting outside of it. I was the tree, and the tree was me. Well, I mean, I still am the tree, but now I have a form. This form.\" Cue gesture to her body. \"But it didn't just happen randomly; I didn't just go poof one day and suddenly have a body, there's a process to it. To transform into something with form, nymphs need a catalyst. Someone who loves the nymph, and who the nymph loves in turn, must give their love to the nymph in the form of Love's Kiss. \"So tell me Ivalyn, how were you born?\" \"Oh!\" She jolted at the unexpected question, her eyes widening, and then narrowing as she thought back and searched her memories. \"Well,\" she started, speaking slowly in the way one does when lost in thought. \"Mother always said that she had been very lonely, for a very long time. She had her animals and garden, but she wanted someone she could talk to. So she went and visited an old friend who was a witch, and explained her situation to her, asking if she could help. Her friend agreed to help her, and gave her a small barleycorn, with instructions to plant and care for it, and once it grew, Mother would not be alone anymore.\" Lili nodded at her, a thoughtful look on her face. \"That makes sense. Witches, particularly ones who are sensitive to magic, can usually tell what seeds or other natural objects will produce a nymph plant. They usually collect them to either create servants or helpers, or to keep in stasis until needed. I've never heard of them giving them away before though. I mean, nymphs are pretty rare, and it's even rarer to just find a nymph object. And from what I'd heard of witches, they tend to hoard precious things. So it's kind of weird that your mother's witch friend just up and gave her your barleycorn.\" Ivalyn nodded, understanding why Lili was confused. \"Mother said that Ms. Gwyneth-her witch friend, that is-had our barleycorn for a long time, and that she was waiting to give it to the right person. Which ended up being Mother, and we were very glad about that. I've never actually met Ms. Gwyneth-though she was going to come visit this winter-but from what I've heard of her from Mother, she doesn't do favors for too many people.\" Here Ivalyn bit her lip, wondering if she should continue, but Lili was being so nice, and was even answering her questions about who she was. \"I think that the reason she gave our barleycorn to Mother is because they're in love. Or at least, I think they are. The thing is, Mother gets this odd look on her face when she talks about Ms. Gwyneth, and for the longest time I didn't know what it was. Recently though, I've realized that that look is what someone looks like when they see the person they love. Because it's the same way that Cornelius looks at Thumbelina.\" -and how Chrysanthos looks at me. Ivalyn thought to herself, a small smile appearing on her face. Sure, her and Chrysanthos had only been together for a night, but he understood her in a way that no one else did, except for maybe her sister. Although Grandma Izzy had questioned her about that whenever they had met up, Ivalyn knew that it was love. Maybe not the strongest, and truest love in the world, but it was love. \"Cornelius? As in, one of the fairy princes?\" Lili asked Ivalyn, who nodded. \"Yeah. He's in love with my sister, Thumbelina.\" Lili suddenly stood up, and moved into Ivalyn's space. \"You have a sister ?!\" She cried with shocked eyes, moving back when Ivalyn flinched at both the sudden movement and the loud noise. \"Sorry. I'm really sorry about that, but you have a sister?\" She was more composed this time, but her sudden mood change had made Ivalyn nervous. \"Y-Yes. When our plant sprouted, she came out of the first flower, and I came out of the second one. Why is that so surprising?\" Lili gestured helplessly for a second, opening and closing her mouth as she searched for words. Frustrated at her own inability to talk, she covered her face with her hands and let out a muffled groan. After a moment had passed, she sat back up and took a deep, fortifying breath. \"Okay. So, first things first: nymphs are rare. I've already said that, but I'm saying it again now. But nymph siblings- twins … they're the stuff of legends. It's like… that is…\" Lili worried her bottom lip between her teeth. After spending about five minutes with her, Ivalyn had picked up on the fact that Lili was a person who talked a lot, but needed time to think over how to best phrase things. So she stayed silent and waited for the nymph to find the right words. \"Plants have power. The more time has passed, the more they grow, and the stronger they become. Even plants that can't live during winter leave imprints of themselves; like how one year a dandelion grows somewhere, and the next there's a whole patch. If that makes sense?\" Ivalyn nodded, and Lili's brow smoothed out a little in relief. \"This is even more true for nymph plants. The older the plant, the stronger the nymph, and the more powerful they become. But with twins, it gets kinda complicated. 'Cause, no one's figured out why, but twin nymphs are twice as powerful as a single born one. The last time a pair of nymphs were born to the same tree, they ended up being worshipped as gods! You might have even heard of them. Are you familiar with Grecian mythology?\" \"Grecian?\" \"Maybe you know it as Greek?\" \"Oh!\" Ivalyn jolted in recognition. \"Yes, Mother had a book of myths which she would read to us at night. Me and Thumbelina always prefered the book of fairy tales though, so I don't remember much.\" \"Well, most of the myths have some basis in events that actually happened, but a lot of the stuff isn't all that accurate. The important thing is that all of the gods actually exist, even if they aren't exactly gods per se. I'm not entirely sure what species most of them are, but two of them are the nymph twins I've told you about. Apollo and Artemis. They both came from a lotus tree, and they grew to be some of the most powerful nymphs ever.\" Lili's eyes gained a far away look, as she became lost in her storytelling. \"Apollo is said to be able to see the future, to heal wounds, and even tell truth from lies. Artemis on the other hand, is said to be able to run quicker than wind, to see further than the horizon, and to hear even the softest sound. Together, they rule over the nymphs who live in Greece and the Mediterranean islands.\" Here Lili seemed to snap out of her momentary trance; giving her head a little shake, she turned to look Ivalyn directly in the eyes. \"So, as you can kinda see, nymph twins are kind of a big deal.\" \"But me and Thumbelina aren't anything like that! We don't have any special powers, or magical abilities. We're just…\" Ivalyn trailed off, as she didn't know how to end it. What were they. Sure, maybe they were nymphs, but even if they were, they weren't anything like Apollo and Artemis. They were just... tiny people; no magic powers, no wings, and no way home. \"Ivalyn.\" She looked up at Lili through eyes blurred with tears. When had she started crying? Lili moved then, and enveloped Ivalyn in a soft embrace. The tears began coming faster now, and Ivalyn clung back tightly. It had been so long since she had hugged someone like this. Before everything, her and Thumbelina would always hug each other or dance together, sharing touches. Ivalyn hadn't realized how used to those touches she was, and how much she had missed them. Grandma Izzy had always hugged her, but they had only met up about once a week or two, when Ivalyn came back from scouring the forest to see if she had news. Long minutes passed like that, as Ivalyn cried and Lili held her. Eventually, the tears began to slow, and then stopped, and Ivalyn sat up, rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand. Lili bit her lip, torn between curiosity and concern. \"...Ivalyn?\" The girl looked up, red rimmed eyes looking questioningly at her. \"I don't want to be rude, so you don't have to answer this if you don't want to. But, where is your sister? What happened that caused you to wander around during the frost?\" \"...After our birth from the flower, we lived happily. Mother loved us, and we loved her, and life at home was... peaceful. But, despite all that, me and my sister...we were discontent. It wasn't that Mother was doing anything wrong, but we weren't doing anything. For me, it was more of the fact that I had all this energy, and the only way that I could get rid of it was through dancing or fencing or swimming. I learned as many different things as possible, because I kept getting bored, and I just had all this energy looking for a way out. \"For Thumbelina, it was more the fact that she wanted to help Mother with all of her tasks, but because of her size, she couldn't. She always tried so hard to be useful, but we were both too small to do anything important. But we continued on, and we tried our hardest to help Mother, and be good daughters. And then, at the beginning of Autumn, everything changed.\" \"If I may cut in for a moment here,\" Lili interrupted, waiting for Ivalyn to nod before she continued. \"I think I might know why you were feeling like that. Full of energy I mean.\" \"Really?\" \"As I said before, all nymphs have power, and although the power varies, it can have interesting effects, depending on the nymph. For example, as a Lily, I have the power of purity and innocence, which means that I can cleanse things that have been tainted, like water or someone who is sick. However, as a Tree, I also gain the ability of protection and strength. In other words, I'm very strong. I've never checked to see how strong, but I do know that I once was able to throw away a bear that thought he could claw up my trunk.\" A bear , Ivalyn thought with wide eyes, thinking of the size of a bear she had seen wandering the woods, and then looking at the size of the nymph in front of her. Lili smirked as she noticed the other nymph's awe. \"Yeah, I think I ended up lucking out on my powers, but that brings me to yours. As a Barleycorn Flower, that might explain why you're so filled with energy. Barleycorns are food, but that also means that they are a way that creatures gain energy . Because of that, I think that what your Barleycorn power ended up being is that you have a lot of energy, and therefore can continue on when others may become exhausted.\" \"Huh,\" Ivalyn blinked, thinking about it. \"That actually explains a lot. So my magical nymph power is that I won't get tired?\" \"Well, right now at least. It might end up heightening into other types of energy powers, but it would definitely take a while for that to happen.\" \"I see. So you said you had two powers, one from the Lily part, the other from the Tree part. Does that mean I have some type of Flower power?\" \"Exactly! You're pretty quick. From what I've seen of other flower users, you could have one of the following powers. One is the power of attraction. The purpose of a flower is to draw attention to a plant, so those nymphs tend to get a lot of suitors. The second power is the power of distraction. This comes from the fact that a lot of flowers distract people from other, more dangerous parts of a plant, like thorns. The third is the power of lure. This is similar to attraction, but it's more dangerous, because it allows a nymph to make someone purposefully walk into danger. For example, a nymph with lure could convince an insect that it's a good idea to walk into a spiderweb.\" \"Ah.\" Ivalyn thought about it for a moment. None of those really sounded like her. But… \"Lili, what you told me about the power of attraction, I think my sister has it.\" \"Really? Does your sister have a lot of suitors?\" \"You could say that. She's in love with Cornelius, but a toad kidnapped both of us to try and convince her to marry him.\" \"WHAT?\" Lili shouted, standing up. \"You got kidnapped ?! Why the heck would-what even-who would be so horrible ?!\" \"Calm down, please.\" Ivalyn smiled humorlessly at Lili. \"Luckily we escaped in time, but from what I've heard, he's still trying to find her. Luckily, she's apparently managed to evade him for all of Autumn, but I'm worried for her, now that it's Winter.\" \"What? But that makes no sense!\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Attraction doesn't work that way, it only works while the nymph is physically there. Once your sister left, the attraction should have gone away, and the toad wouldn't have had it affecting him anymore. Unless…\" Lili trailed off, her eyes going wide as she thought of something. \"Lili. Unless what?\" \"Even with the nymph twin thing making the attraction more powerful, no attraction would last all of Autumn. But, your sister also came from a Barleycorn, and from what you've told me, she doesn't have the same power as you. Which means she might have one of the other two Barleycorn powers.\" \"And what would those powers be?\" \"The power you have is the power of energy to the self, also known as increased energy for the nymph who has it. The second power is the power of energy to drain. The nymph that has that, can drain energy from their surroundings to increase their own. A friend of mine named Bailey, who's a Daughter of Barleycorn also, has this power. She's why I know so much about this. The third power is the one I think your sister has. The power of energy to others, or of giving energy. In other words, everyone around your sister feels better, or more energized. The problem with that, is that coupled with attraction, everyone around your sister who decides to pursue her, is going to remember that feeling, even after attraction wears off. Which means-\" \"-That Thumbelina is like a walking target. Oh no! I have to find her!\" Ivalyn scrambled out of the bed, already looking around for a door. Lili reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her to a stop. \"Ivalyn, calm down. Think about this rationally. Your sister is outside in Winter, yes, but as long as your flower is cared for, you and her won't die. So, time is on our side. Let's contact the other nymphs, and then we can ask them to help us search the forest. Okay?\" \"But what if someone else sees her and tries to take her away?!\" \"Oh, gosh. I never went over foci. Dang it, I knew I forgot something. Okay, so Ivalyn, your sister isn't just using her powers wily nily all the time. They're activated by something the nymph does.\" \"What?\" Ivalyn turned to look at Lili, slightly calmer now. \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that all nymphs have a focus; something we use to channel our powers. For me, that something is brushing my hair. Yes, it sounds really stupid, but brushing my hair makes me feel happy, and it was what became my focus. As for yours, what do you do that makes you feel happy?\" Ivalyn thought about it for a moment. She was happy when she was with her sister, but that wasn't an activity. But there was something niggling at the tip of her tongue... \"Oh! Dancing! I love dancing. So then, that's my focus, and then Thumbelina's would be singing!\" Lili smiled, letting go of Ivalyn's wrist. \"Good, so as long as your sister doesn't sing in front of others, there's no need to hurry. Come on, let's contact the nymphs. I'll teach you how to use the root system.\" Smiling, Ivalyn followed Lili, feeling better yet still filled with worry for Thumbelina. Back at the house where Thumbelina and Ivalyn lived, Mother looked out of the open window one last time, before mournfully closing it. Gwyneth had promised she would look for her daughters, but that would take time, as she need to contact the forest spirits to help her search. Until then, Mother was all alone. Picking up a candle, she walked over to the cradle her daughters had slept on. \" I know there's someone Somewhere Someone Who's sure to find them Soon\" All the farm animals huddled together sadly, all of them listening to the heartbroken mother sing. Mother laid down two dresses she had made for her daughters on the cradle; one was light yellow, the other a soft pink. \" After the rain goes There are rainbows They'll find the rainbow Soon Soon my breaking heart will mend Soon a happy ending Troubles behind them I will find them Homeward bound Safe and sound and Soon\" Mother rocked back and forth in her chair, as Hero stood vigil beside her. Both waiting for the girls to come back.

Ch 1: Love Confirmed Becky and Spike have been going out for months now six to be specific and everything is going well. Danny has been very accepting of Spike noticing how happy he makes his daughter. Of Course it helps if his father is your friend. Becky wakes up remembering the last six months; six most wonderful months in which just saying Spike is her boyfriend makes her smile and make what to spend more time with him. He was so gentle with her but still maintained an edge that still made him seem dangerous and made her feel dainty and more feminine than she had ever felt before when playing football and being a tomboy. No now he made her feel sexy, the way he looked at her and she felt that only noticed her. Nothing can be said about the kisses he gave her but Whoa. Those were some HOT kisses and they only got better and better as time passed. Nothing compared to how her life was like now. She got up and went to the restroom to take of business, take a shower and get ready for school it was senior year and this year was going to be the year where she would really shine. She would make the best of it. She would definitely enjoy herself, go to homecoming who knows maybe she would run for homecoming king and have Spike by her side as her King. She couldn't wait for prom. All she thought about was Spike and those things that they would do together. But for now she would have to hurry up Spike would pass by to pick her for their first day of senior year. As she walked down the stairs she saw her dad Jr and Patty having breakfast she sat down and her dad handed her a plate of really delicious pancakes, they were her dad's specialty. Jr was also waiting for Spike they decided to go together but then again they were always together they had their own little group and nobody messed with them the whole Giant gang that still lived in Urbania were still together it didn't matter if they were nerdy they still remained friends. There was a knock on the door Becky got up having finished her breakfast in the fifteen minutes it took for Spike to get there. As Becky opened the door she saw Spike standing there in all his handsome glory and launched herself at him knowing her would her against his strong arms. Once in his embrace she stood on her tip toes and his lips with as much passion and love as she could, considering her dad was in the room. Breaking apart she said hi to him and invited him inside. Once inside he said hello to everyone in the house and asked Becky and Jr if they were ready. They got their school packs and headed out to Spikes Car. Jr and Spike had decided to Carpool taking turns going to school. Becky sat in the front passenger of Spike's Red Mustang Convertible. Once they were in Motion to pick Debbie up Spike grabbed Becky's hand just to feel her close to him. Spike was happy with Becky he loved her more each day every day he woke up and thought about her and about how happy she made him. She made him feel Special and wanted because of her he finally new the meaning of true friendship, of having people like you for you and not about what you could give them. She was the reason why he had more and more friends each day. She tough him how be more open to people and be more accepting of people faults and realize that everyone was different, that they didn't have to be like you for you to like them. He couldn't wait to go to her house to pick her up; he would also be picking up his best friend Jr. His was like no other friend even with all the antagonistic things he did Jr extended a hand of friendship which he gladly took. Spike got ready he dressed in blue jeans that fitted just the right way with a knit shirt and black dress shoes, he went outside to his red convertible thinking about Becky and how happy she made him. He knew at the time when she accepted to be his girlfriend that he take care of her and love her just like he knew she loved him. As he got out of his car and knocked on the door he did not expect Becky to answer the door and launch herself at him especially seeing her dressed in a tight red skirt that reached below mid thigh exposing her wonderful sexy legs and wearing high heels making those same wonderful legs seem miles long like a model. And her top not being sleazy but revealing a hit of cleavage and shoulder again making het look really sexy. She reached up to him as gave him one of the most wonderful kisses of his life. Of Course all the kisses she gave him were magical. But seeing her like this he couldn't help but realize that he was the luckiest guy around. He escorted both Becky and Jr to his car. On his way to pick up Jr's girlfriend and Becky's Cousin Debbie he couldn't help himself and just had to maintain physical contact with Becky so holding her hand he drove off.[Chapter 2] You Love ME! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Disclaimer: I own nothing! Spike and Icebox are together but who is this new girl I why is she eyeing Spike. Find out what happens when someone tries to take away Becky's man. Sequel to You Love Who? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Sorry I haven't posted anything I went through a severe writers block CHAPTER 2: The Accident Spike and Becky arrived at school they met up with their friends and talked while classes started they couldn't wait to see if they had any classes together. As the bell rung they walked of Becky had a class with some of the Giants and her cousin Becky but sadly Spike was nowhere near one of her classes. At least there was still Lunch and they might be able to see each other during football practice of course it wasn't the same I belong to the girl's team but we took what we can get. We could always see each other after school. As we are doing drills I can't help but trying to find Spike, maybe they are running laps or something. Suddenly I spot him and I see this really horrible looking girl trying to flirt with him, you could tell she was a cheerleader or something. She had blond hair tied up in ponytail high on her head she was wearing stretch shorts in black and a cute looking exercise shirt in red. As I continued to look I hadn't realize that the girls (my football team) we about to start a play. Still looking at spike and the mystery girl I didn't notices the offense come my way, and then I feel a force that knocked me down. I saw stars and I could have sworn it felt like a car hit me (not literally we are talking about a girl tackling me). I hit the ground and I hit my head, suddenly I'm bombarded and surrounded by girls asking me if I was ok. Coach walks up to be and says, Coach: \"you ok O'shea? Becky: \"yeah coach I'm fine Coach: \"Good come on we'll send you to the nurse to clean up your wound. At that point I did not realize that I had a bump on my head and that it was bleeding. Coach took over of the situation and took me to the nurse, while she led me there I just hoped that the guys hadn't seen that I had a reputation to withhold I mean I am the Iceboxx. I. don't. Get. Hurt and it would be just plain embarrassing especially if Spike saw while talking to his little \" friend\" . Great what is this feeling I'm having? Is it jealousy? I don't know but I don't like it. Finally I'm walking out from the nurse my dad having to pick me up, me... well I'm walking with a huge bump on the head… how can you tell well easy the nurse couldn't find a smaller bandage at least on that I considered small. Aside from that is the huge headache that I have, never mind the comfy gym clothes I use for practice that I'm wearing (I dint get a chance to chance) and so I had go get my stuff. To top it off I won't be able to go home with MY boyfriend and ask HIM who the heck was that blonde that was hanging all over him. As I'm walking and wondering my dad breaks through my thoughts. Danny: \"Honey how are you feeling? Do you feel lightheaded? Nauseous? Dizzy? What? You can tell me.\" He is talking so fast and feel bad that he is worried so much and it shows I feel bad for him but I answer him trying to comfort him. Becky: \"dad I'm fine. I'm feeling ok. I just have a headache.\" Danny: \"we'll just take you home and you can rest we could pick up a movie on the way and any choice of food you want even dessert if you're up for it\" Again I feel bad for putting him in this worry mode all because I wasn't paying attention. On the way home true to his word we picked out a couple of movies and some burgers. I also managed to text Debbie so that she could tell spike that I wouldn't be able to go with him because of my small accident (which was now that size of a golf ball). I guess told Aunt Karen and Patty what happened because they met us at the hold fussing and really smothering me making me hot. Don't get me wrong it's a nice gesture and I like it still it's an uncomfortable feeling because I'm not used to all the attention. Patty and Aunt Karen take over for Dad and walk upstairs they put in the bath of course minding my bandage, after that they help into my pajamas, feed me and basically guard me to make sure nothing is wrong with me (bad things could happened with head injuries you know) Now I don't mind that attention so much it feels kind of nice since I didn't have a mom growing up they feel like they were both my moms it's a nice feeling. I feel all gooey inside, but don't tell my friends ok. Wrapped up in warm blackest in my two piece red silk pajamas (compliment of patty for Christmas… they are so comfy) a finally fell asleep. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE COMMENT AND LEAVE A GOOD REVIEW AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT.[Chapter 3] Little Giants! You Love ME! Disclaimer: I own nothing! Spike and Icebox are together but who is this new girl I why is she eyeing Spike. Find out what happens when someone tries to take away Becky's man. Sequel to You Love Who? Sorry I haven't posted anything I wanted everything to be perfect! Thanks for being REALLY patient! It was a whole new day and I was indeed feeling the pain. So much so that I did not want to wake up. In the back of my mind I kept reminding myself why it was that I was even feeling this in the first place and the part that was the worst was that not only was the experience totally humiliating because I happened in of many people but because it happened in front of my team mates. These people were the ones that saw me at by best when I was in the zone and I was the invincible Iceboxx. That was just embarrassing. Not only that but I hurt myself for not being focused and insecure. Still not wanting to get up I was hearing voices. People were in my room talking in low voices, talking about, \"she's going to be okay\" and, \"it will be better in a few days. Not knowing what they were talking about I moved to my side, and what a mistake that was as I turned in my pillow trying to once again find a comfy spot I felt a burning sensation on my cheek and forehead. I didn't realize I had released a moan of pain and all of a sudden I hear my dad asking me if I was okay. As I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed three things, 1. The right side of my face where I was knocked down, hurt really badly as I moved and opened my eyes. 2. There were very concerned looking faces staring at me and 3. Spike had come to see me. I tried to get up but my body hurt, my dad and Spike were there on each side of my bed telling me not to move and to lie back. As I moved back to lie down once more I realized that I was inn even more pain than I had noticed before. My arms and back hurt as well as my neck and my legs were not that far behind thank goodness I was wearing my silk pajamas because they were really comfy and in my favorite color red. I tried to talk to my dad and Spike to let them know that I was in Pain but I was okay, I then also noticed my jaw hurt to talk. My dad noticed this and told everyone that he would be taking me to the doctor. I wanted to talk to Spike on what had happened yesterday and about that girl he was talking to. Spike seemed to realize this and gave a look that said, \"We will talk later\". I nodded signifying that I understood. My dad proceeded to tell everyone that they could visit me later. I watched the procession of family member walk out of my room. Jr, Debbie, and finally Spike walked outgiving me one last look as he left followed by my dad. Patty stayed behind saying she would help me dress and get ready to leave and head for the doctor's office. Arriving at the doctors required a lot of help I seemed that I got more injured than I had thought. The doctor brought out a wheel chair at my dad's request. They wheeled me in to a small check up room where I was asked to put on a gown. Patty helped me while my dad and the doctor had stepped outside to wait for me. Once I was everything was done the doctor told me that I had some bruising and swelling in my body; the right side of my face had bruising on the forehead and cheek area as well as around my right eye. Both my right arm and shoulder were bruised. My back and legs had some soreness in them and my right wrist had been sprained so he put a few bandages and a sling to keep it from moving too much. Of course they had put a bandage on my stitched up forehead. They finally let me go home notifying my dad that I would rest and not go to school for a couple of days which would eventually turn into torture for me. He finally gave some painkillers and some ointments. Finally I was free, in pain but free from the doctors'. Dad took me home, picking up some take out on the way home. As I rested and fell asleep throughout the day I was incredibly bored I felt like if I had been run over by a car, all bandaged up and in bed. I normally wasn't the type of person to pout and sulk at home or anywhere for that matter but that is what I was doing today. My dad had not let me go to school following the doctor's orders saying I would be home for a couple of days without getting up to much at least until the soreness from my legs and back was gone. Still I was sad that I would not get to spend more time with my boyfriend and friends as well as keep an eye on him to see if that blond bimbo of a cheerleader was trying to get with my man. Suddenly I realized I was feeling jealous again something I was not used to feeling. I knew I had to do something even if it meant getting advice from Debbie I'm sure with Jr being a football star in high school and being surrounded by groupies that tried to get Jr's attention she would know a thing or two about it. One thing for sure she would not let Spike get taken away from her. This would mean war and nobody messed with the Iceboxx and this blond bimbo find out. My only worry today is if Spike would visit I mean I knew he had practice and it worried me but I loved Spike and I'm pretty sure he love me too. I know he will come see me today. I hope! Thanks for Reading please review and respond. If you want to let me know what could happen next what you would like to read on the next chapter. Luv Ya guys ;)![Chapter 4] You Love ME! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Disclaimer: I own nothing! Spike and Icebox are together but who is this new girl I why is she eyeing Spike. Find out what happens when someone tries to take away Becky's man. Sequel to You Love Who? Chapter 4 : The New Girl? For the next couple of days I was unable to see any of my friends my dad wouldn't let them. It seems that the doctor had notified him that uninterrupted rest was mandatory for a couple of days and of course my dad being a worry wart followed my doctor's instructions much to my ultimate dismay. I couldn't stand it anymore I was going crazy with not knowing what was going on with my friends and most importantly my boyfriend. I needed to see Debbie soon she would know what was going on; she always knew what happened around the school. After about two to three days of \"resting\" my dad finally let people visit me as I waited for them to show up I really wished Spike would be the first to show up. Starring at my ceiling I heard a knock at my bedroom door. I called out for whoever it was to enter. It was ... Debbie she came in looking at me she asked how I was feeling I told her I was feeling better. \"You look terrible!\" she said \" yeah well so do you\" I said then I really looked at her she seemed nervous or worried somehow and asked. \"So... have you seen Spike lately?\" she asked. \"No actually he hasn't come to see me yet. Why are you asking?\" I said to her. \"Oh... uh... Nothing\" she stammered. She was not a very good liar, I could see through her nervousness and she only stammers when she is hiding something or knows something but doesn't want to tell me. The last time that happened was when she accidently dropped my favorite jersey in the fireplace. But I'm getting off subject . She is acting way to suspicious. I stared her down and motioned for her to sit. Once she sat down by my bed I told her in a very stern voice to tell me what was going on. \"There is something you are not telling me, I know you. Tell me now.\" I said. She was making me a nervous wreck by now. Noticing that she was making me upset she finally said,... \" Ok here is the deal I will tell you but please don't kill the cheerleader ok?.\" Right when she said that I knew there was something wrong. Impatiently I told her. \" Well tell me then what is going on, I need to know!\" finally she said, \" It's about Spike \" \"What happened to Spike?\" I asked impatiently. \"Did something happen to him?\" I asked again but she kept looking at me like if she was trying to decide if she should tell me or not. \"Well\" I said. I took her about three hours when she finally said something. Okay I'm exaggerating obviously but that is how worried I was . \" Ok\" She said. This what has happened while you have been injured ... Spike has been talking to this girl. It seems like they have met before\" she said. I didn't know what to think so I asked her again. \" What do you mean they know each other or something?\" \"Yes\" she said its seems that when he was in the pee wee league after he left the cowboys he met her or something I don't know for sure, well they met and were like an item or something\" she said again. \"What do you mean she used to be his girlfriend?\" I asked shocked that this was happening. \" Look I don't know I asked Jr about it and that is all he said. that they knew each other but they were friends now... but I don't now it seems like she is too close to Spike sometimes. And there is also something else\", Debbie said. Something else I asked myself. what else could there be? Finally I spoke. \"What else is there?\" \" Well It seems like she used to be a cheerleader and wants to be one again... she has been to try outs and is pretty good... I mean I won't her in if you don't want me too, you know I would do anything for you, right? But Spike did ask me to help her out so I don't know what to do. You tell me what you want me to do.\" she said again. This was too much for so I sat in my bed looking at her to see what she was thinking but most of all too think about the situation I mean this was Spike we were talking about he was the best boyfriend ever he was sweet and caring and would never cheat on me or forget me right? But he hasn't come to see you yet the voice in my head said. I knew I could trust Spike though because relationships could not last. RIGHT! I trusted him. Finally decided I answered her . \"If you think she is good then do what you need to do.\" I told her She looked at me and said, \" Ok this is what I'll do I haven't made a decision but I'll be fair ok? that's all I will do.\" Debbie replied. \" Now you must rest Spike should come to see you soon right?\" She said again. I laid back in my bed thinking about everything Debbie and I had talked about and wondered why Spike hadn't come to see me yet. I mean why hadn't he come yet. I know he has practice but I'm important too right? Feeling sleepy I closed my eyes but I kept thinking about Spike. Finally a new chapter. :) sorry for not updating sooner I dint know what to write for a while finally I came up while what to write. Thanks to all who reviewed.

Thanks Again. Readnwritelover[Chapter 5] Hi, everyone I am sorry that I have not posted anything in months it been hard for me lately. Not only did I not know what to write but also I totally blanked out about everything. Here is a new post and good news I got my Mojo back so to make up I will be posting two or three more chapters this week ok. Please Review. Also give ideas on what you would like to see happen next. You love me? Chapter 5: The Confrontation However, Spike didn't come. He didn't even call. At this point, I was mad, and most of all disappointed. Soon I would be going to school two more days. There was no excuse. There was no excuse that there was no communication from Spike. He had better have a good explanation. Two Days later. Becky was getting ready for school. She would do something she usually didn't do she let Debbie help her dress and get ready. Debbie made her wear a red silk blouse, paired with a wide black belt that went around her waist. She was wearing a black flow skirt with Black and red kitten heals. She looked like a girl. Normally Becky would complain, but with this attire maybe Spike would finally notice her and that he hasn't seen her in about two weeks. Did he not care that she was at home after an accident? It would serve him right if she never spoke to him again. How could he do this to her. Just Forget about her with any thoughts about how she would eel. Didn't he know that she would want to see him? What if their roles were reversed? Would he not expect the same? Finally she was really Debbie had done her hair letting it hang down with curls in the ends and a nice beret of a small red butterfly. She stared in the mirror. She would have never pictured herself like this. If she admitted to herself, she looked… pretty. She actually looked like a girl. Not like those bimbos she didn't like that looked like total sluts but the girl, she always wanted to be. Debbie and Becky walked down the stairs to see Jr. waiting for them to go to school. Arriving Becky felt somewhat uncomfortable people were staring the girls were staring with jealousy in their eyes as their boyfriends were staring at her with lust in their eyes. She didn't care; she only had eyes for one person. She only wanted to impress one person, Spike. They were walking down the hall towards their locker. Becky was getting nervous. Her locker was close to Spike's and she couldn't wait to see his reaction. Would he be sorry? Would he even notice? Well she could not back out now. Besides she was not just Becky she was also the Iceboxx and she was a girl but she was a tough girl. Arriving at her locker she did see Spike, her heart raced, she was nervous. Most of all she knew she had to confront him. He still had not noticed her. She did the only thing a girl in her position could do she walked up to confront him. As she neared him, she noticed he was not alone. There was a girl with him and they were laughing with each other. There was one thing she knew now. He was definitely not missing her. She observed the girl. She had Blonde hair, blue eyes, and relatively big breasts. She looked like a model something she never thought she would look like. It was easy to see why he would hang out with her. Determined she tapped his shoulder and was happy that he was shocked at her appearance. He could not help to notice the anger and hurt in her eyes as well. \"Hi Spike remember me?\" Becky said in a firm voice. \"Becky is that you? Responded spike with utter shock and nervousness. Just by staring at her, he knew he messed up big time. ***Spike POV*** Becky was here. Man she looks pissed. Wasn't she sick? Darn. She was. What have I been doing? She looks nice though. She has never done this. She should do this more often. ***Becky POV*** What is he doing? He's just starring like the rest of the Idiots. Can't he see that I'm mad? \"Spike your starring. In addition, from the look in your eyes I can see that you didn't even remember I existed. Don't worry you won't have to remember anymore, besides there are other guys that would be willing to remember me\" Becky walked away leaving a stunned audience and a definitely stunned Spike. ***Spike POV*** What does she mean don't' remember her? Don't have to remember her anymore? Other guys? Darn it where is she? \"He finally woke up from his stupefaction looking around to see if he could see her. \" Darn she's gone!\" He stood there and forgot about the girl he was spending most of his time with. Realizing that he HAD forgotten about Becky. That she had probably broken up with him based on what she said about other guys. \"What do I do now?\" He asked himself. \"Spike are you ok? Who was that girl that was mad at you? Come on honey let's get to class.\" His companion said. She tries to grab his hand but he shook it off leaving him behind. As Spike walked off thinking about Becky, he knew he would have to speak to her to clear things out. He also knew he had a lot of explaining to do. Ok that's it Please review. ReadnwriteLover[Chapter 6] You Love Me! Chapter 6: Explanation Becky was beyond mad if Spike didn't want her anymore he should just tell her. He doesn't need to beat around the bush. She's a big girl she could take it. BECKY POV Who does he think he is? In addition, he didn't even say anything about the girl or introduce her as his girlfriend. She was pretty I guess if you liked blonde girls with blue eyes and a girly body to match. What bothered me the most was that he just stood there. He didn't say hello. He didn't give an explanation. Most of all he didn't apologize to me. He didn't even seem to be sorry. As much as I love him, he will not treat me this way my dad raised an independent girl here I'm tough. But, I'm still going to miss him. We'll see what happens. Normal POV Becky walked in to her class. All the boys were staring and it felt nice for them to notice that she was a girl and they drooled over. She found her seat next to her cousin. The class began. Spike was ashamed he kept walking to his class with Wendy right behind him she kept trying to grab his arm but he wouldn't let her. He walked her to her class without a glance her way. He knew she would be mad but she would get over it. He had met Wendy while he attended her school for a while. She was the popular girl, a cheerleader with blonde hair and blue eyes. He went out with her, mostly because she insisted. Then he left and that was it. Now here she was. He walked into his class before he was late and hoped that he could talk to Becky and that she would be willing to listen to him. Besides, she looked nice today and he didn't want boys to be staring at her. At lunchtime, Becky sat with Jr. and Debbie, along with other of their friends they were talking about the new girl. Apparently, while she was out they would join their group. They being Spike and the new girl named Wendy. Spike walked up to the group with Wendy in tow and noticed that Becky was sitting with the group. What could he expect? They were her friends too. Wendy walked passed and sat next to one of the football players and called to Spike. \"Come honey sit next to me.\" Everyone got quiet, he also noticed the look in Becky's face. A look of hurt crossed her face. He needed to talk to her now. Her placed his lunch tray in a random place in the table and called to Becky so they could go talk elsewhere while Wendy kept calling to go sit down with her. He just ignored her. Becky seemed mad now and would not let him touch her. He had a lot of groveling to do. Spike POV I led her outside to an area where no one would eavesdrop. Before she started talking, he began. \" Look I'm sorry Becky about her inside. We met before and I rather took her under my wing so she had somebody to talk too. She calls me honey you know? It doesn't mean anything.\" He stammered out. \" Oh yeah, I understand that you would want to help out a friend alright. Because you are just friends, right?\" She Asked. \" Well I used to go to her school way before I moved here. We used to go out also.\" Noticing the look in her face of disbelief, I continued. \"But we ended things a long time ago. Before I ever saw you again. We're friends now\" I finished. \" Well\" she said. \"She doesn't think you are just friends. Aside from that, you knew I had gotten hurt and didn't even bother to find out if I was Ok. You didn't even visit me at all.\" \"I did visit you but then the doctor said you couldn't see anybody for a while because you needed to rest\" I cut in. She needed to understand. \"You visited me? Really what about after when I could have visitors? What about then? Where were the phone calls? Even your dad called. Where were you Spike? I know you were playing tour guide with your girlfriend and forgot about me. Don't deny it Spike. You just had better things to do.\" She said almost in tears. Becky's POV I would not let him see me cry. I am the Iceboxx. The Iceboxx did not cry in front of boys. She did not let them have control. Right now, i needed to be strong . I needed to have the Iceboxx talking to Spike or I don't know if I would last. He forgot about me and I couldn't let him walk all over me. Later I would cry when no one was around. When Spike wouldn't see me. \"Face it Spike you have no time for me anymore. I understand, there are more important people you need to be with and in your life I'm not important anymore.\" I told barely controlling my tears. \"No Becky, You mean everything to me. You…\" That's when that witch came up to us and interrupted. \"Hey Love you are going to miss lunch come on\" She said. That's when she did the most hurtful things anyone could ever do to me. She kissed him, and he let her. I couldn't take it anymore I had to get out of there. I ran. So there is the new Chapter I hope you like it please Review I'd like at least eight good reviews. Let me know what you like. What you don't like. What you want to see next. ReadnwriteLover[Chapter 7] You Love Me! Chapter 7: Hurting Becky POV I need to get out of here. I took out my cell phone. I called my dad; he would get me out of here. Ringing Danny: \"Hello\" Becky: \"Dad\" D: Becky what's going on? Honey are you Ok? … Are you crying?\" I wanted to cry so badly and it was hard to talk but I had too I couldn't stay here. B: Dad…Please get me out of here now! Please. Dad: \"What's going on? School's almost out. Can you stay there a little longer?\" B: Please I will tell you about it later but please take me out of here. I'll leave here if I have to, but I'd rather you pick me up.\" Hearing the tone in her voice, he knew something was wrong. Danny knew there was something wrong. He made his decision then. D: Ok go to the nurse and say you have a stomachache. If I have to pick you up, we'll do it right with permission from the school. Ok?\" B: \"Thanks Dad\" Hanging up she was relieved and followed her dad's suggestion. Spike POV What was happening here? I gently push Wendy away. Looking around I also noticed that Becky was gone. Darn this was going to get even worse now. Looking at Wendy, he was mad now. '\"What were you thinking? I'm not your boyfriend I told you that I had a girlfriend already. Why did you kiss me? Wendy stood there pouting. \"But honey?\" She said. Interrupting her, I told her. \"Nothing, there is nothing you can say right now. I'm upset with you right now and I need to talk to my girlfriend and explain. You need to apologize to her as well.\" I told her angrily. Seriously what was this girl thinking? When went out a long time ago. Now I'm with Becky. Well who knows now. Walking away, I went in search of Becky. The rest of lunchtime, I went in search and did not find her. I asked our friends and they had not seen her. By the end of lunch, I was frustrated. By the end of the day, she had not shown up for the rest of her classes. Somebody said her dad had picked her up from the nurse's office. His Luck was practically none existing. Danny POV My daughter was crying. She never cried, even when she confronted my about cheerleading with the little giants. She didn't cry when her mom left. However, she was now crying, over a boy who broke her heart. I never thought something like this would happen. My daughter was tough. Spike was now on my bad side. Now I would have to figure out how to have a talk with my daughter about boys. This was something her mother would have to talk to her about, I could let Patty talk to her, but I needed to take care of my daughter. The problem would be if Becky wanted to talk to me further and let me help her. I walked her room and noticed that she was still crying, most off all she looked mad. She should be mad. One thing for sure he would not allow Spike into his house, especially to see his daughter. Looking at her now, he realized that this was his little girl. For a long time it was hard to see her as such because, she was never a girly girl. She never really seemed to need him. They were always friends, with the exception of the little giants, she never really needed him too much emotionally. She always took care of herself she has always been independent. Looking as her he realized as well that he missed many steps with his daughter. It was time to stepped up and be a father. Starting today, he was going to be a parent. For now, he would hurt with his daughter and make her feel better. Here is another Chapter Please Review ReadnwriteLover.[Chapter 8] Sorry for not updating I will try post again this week. I hope that you enjoy and please review. The more reviews the faster I will post. Remember to give ideas. You Love me! Disclaimer: Don't own Little Giants Chapter 8: Resignation Becky spent the rest of the night in her room Crying. She thought about her relationship with Spike. She knew things had to change. She would not be with someone who lied, cheated and hurt her. At least she found out now before anything else happened with them. Her Dad was the best dad she could ask for. He was trying she that. It must be awkward for him because she has always been a tomboy and he wouldn't know how to deal with boy trouble. She was happy that at least he was trying and she couldn't ask for more. She had had to return to school but she didn't want to see Spike with that other girl. He still hadn't tried calling her to explain himself. He hadn't even tried to show up at her house. Jr. hadn't asked what was going on. That was weird because he was a really nosy person. And he was a guy. Stereotypically it was the girls that went snooping but he surprised her. Poor Patty she wanted to make her feel better but didn't know if it was her place since she wasn't her mom. Becky couldn't be happy to have these people in her life. She wasn't giving up on Spike but she wasn't going to be with someone that didn't want her no matter how much she wanted him back. She would move on she is young and has so much to live for. She would not let her herself suffer for a boy. She was strong and independent just her dad taught her to be. She would go to school with her head held high. If Spike didn't want to fight for their relationship she was not going to force him. She knew that one day she would meet someone she deserved even if it wasn't Spike Hammersmith. First though she needs to talk to her dad and explain what happened to make her break down. She got off the bed and went to her door to call her dad upstairs. Becky POV \"DAD!\" Danny: \"Yes Becky?\" \"Can you come upstairs please?\" Danny: \"Sure honey I'll be right up\" If I know my dad I know he will be upset but hell support me I know. I went over to sit on my bed and waited for him to come into my bed room. He walks in and I notice that he looks worried. I love my dad. \"Dad I need to tell you what is going on and why I called you the way I did\" Danny: \"Ok honey but you kind of scared me a little.\" He said sitting down on my bed after closing my bedroom door to give us some privacy. \"It's like this. As you know after the accident at school Spike hasn't really been calling me or coming to visit me. So when I went to school I saw him at school with another girl. I didn't want to freak out so I waited for a time when I could talk to him. At lunch we finally had the chance and well we were talking when did girl walks up to him and kisses him. I got mad and ran away to call you.\" He sat there waiting patiently for me to finish my story and looked with something in his eyes. What that was that I could see in his eyes I don't know. I looked like he understood where I was coming from. He waited a moment and thought about everything that I told him. He also seemed a little upset. Before he could say anything I told him my resolution about everything. \"Before you say something I have decided that I will not continue a relationship with someone who doesn't value me and cheats on me.\" He looked at me. Danny: \"Well honey I understand where you are coming from and will support you in any way that I can. I am glad that you came to me and told me how you are and how you are feeling. I just hope you don't expect me to be nice to him anymore. It will be hard because I am friends with. I will have to talk to him though I hope you don't mind. I will just explain that I will respect your decision and not intervene. Ok?\" \"Yeah dad thanks for being there for me.\" I felt better now that I spoke to him now I would have to talk to Jr. and Debbie on the new changes. I would have to wait to see how they take things. There a new chapter. Enjoy and please REVIEW! Thanks![Chapter 9] You Love Me! Chapter 9: The Break up Becky did not go to school the following day and her dad was okay with that decision with the condition that she would attend the following day and make up all missed assignments. Becky agreed thankful to her dad for understanding. Becky had decided that she would tell both Debbie and Jr. of what has happened and what she saw. They agreed with her decision to break up and would support her in any way. Jr. however had taken a little bit more harshly than Debbie and had threatened that he would confront Spike. It took some convincing mostly on Debbie's side but he agreed that he would let Becky handle it her way. They had decided that they would not let Spike get near Becky except for when Becky would officially tell Spike it was over. They would have to stop talking to Spike for a while though while Becky mended her broken heart or at least not do things together. Spike POV Becky did not show up to school today and I tried calling Jr. to see if he could tell me anything but he won't answer me. He is probably taking Becky's side. Not that I wouldn't blame him. I have told my dad what happened and he understood what I was feeling but he also understood and made me realize that Becky probably was hurt and would not listen to anything I had to say so I followed his advice and let Becky think first. Maybe that was a mistake. I have decided though if she doesn't come to school today I would go see her and I guess suffer the wrath of an angry dad. Not that I didn't deserve it to a certain point what was wrong with me. I didn't go to see her when she had the accident at school and I hadn't called her. I really Miss her and I knew I would have to do something about Wendy. It was the day that Becky would confront Spike again. She was nervous. She was upset, but who could blame her. Spike had still not called her or been to visit her to see if she was okay or trying to explain and apologize. So she dressed to impress today but not over the top. Enough only… to make Spike realize what he was missing. What he had let go. Becky was walking down the hall. Good thing people were oblivious today. At least she hoped. Jr. and Debbie were at their locker not far off for which she was grateful. She knew they had her back. She was getting some books for her next classes and did not notice Spike come up to her. She did not notice how he was looking at her admiring her natural beauty and she did not notice how Wendy was looking at her from afar at her Locker. Wendy looked at her with hate and as if she was planning revenge for something that was taken from her. This was further from reality. It was all in her head. Spike finally spoke. \"Hi Becky I missed you yesterday. I wanted to talk to you.\" At this Becky took in a few breaths and faced him. \"Really I didn't think you had noticed what with you sucking face with that other girl at lunch the other day. I didn't know you actually cared.\" She said bitterly. \"No Becky she is just a friend I don't know why she did that but I wouldn't do that to you. You have to believe me.\" He said trying to convince her he was saying the truth. \"I don't have to do anything and you know what I have class which I don't want to be late for since I was absent.\" She said closing her locker and walking away from him. Leaving Spike to stare after her sadly and a happy looking Wendy from her locker, noticing his reaction, thinking things were changing. Not imagining that this was indeed what would happen. Though who knew if things were to her way, nobody knew what would happen next. The rest of the day before lunch was passed with anxiousness. Becky knowing she would be breaking things off and Spike hoping to talk her soon. At Lunch Becky and Jr. along with Debbie sat together on their own apart from the rest of the jock and most student population. They knew what was going to happen next. Spike had to get away from Wendy first know that his problems started with her. So he ditched her and went to look for Becky. He found her eating lunch in an area where they didn't usually sit. At first he was confused and hurt. But, then thought that it was for the better this way they could talk without interference. He walked up to her and sat waiting for her to acknowledge him. She looked up and said. \"We need to talk.\" This was not something that he was expecting and the way she said that phrase. He knew nothing good would come out of this. At least for him! She stood up and walked out to an isolated area. He followed. She stopped where she knew no one would hear them. Together they spoke looking at each other in the eyes. \"I'm sorry\" \"I want to break up\" \"What?\" They both said surprised. Spike Allowed Becky to start first knowing from what she had said that he was not going to like it. \"I want to break up Spike\" She repeated looking at his confused face. \"I don't think we should be together anymore. I don't think I trust you either.\" She finished waiting to see what he had to say. \"No! You can't do this if this is because of Wendy I promise you that I have nothing going on with her. She was an old friend… girlfriend wwwaaayyy… before we even got together. She moved here and I've been showing her around but that's it we are friends. I sorry I didn't tell you before but she just surprised me and you know. But then you accident happened and I went to see you. Then nobody was allowed to see you, and I was worried but I did miss you and I did not spend all my time with her. Really! She surprised me at lunch the other day too but I corrected her because you are my girlfriend. Don't break up with me please. I love you!\" He finished looking worried and heartbroken. Becky looked at him and for a second almost reconsidered but she had made a decision. \"I believe you.\" She said. \"But the fact is that I no longer feel that this relationship should stay together. I waited for you to call. To come and visit me when the accident happened, I wanted to see you. You didn't even ask about me right? You hid things from me or you didn't tell me what was going on. You let her drape herself all over you. I saw you. But most off all I feel that I can't trust you. A relationship without trust is doomed and don't want to live that way. So we are better off apart. Besides everyone knows that a girl and a guy can never be really friends after they have been in a relationship. Please just respect my decision, let's end this amicably and move on.\" She was crying at this point. She looked into his eyes. She saw the hurt there and the determination. \"You want to break up? Fine, but know that I don't agree and I won't be moving on because I love you! And only you! I promise you that my friendship with Wendy is over. There will no other relationship besides classmates. This goes for every other girl in this school and anywhere else. I am doing this for you to regain your trust but I do it against my will. Know that I will spend the rest of my time trying to gain you forgiveness, your love and your trust. We will get back together!\" With that he walked away. He got his lunch and disappeared. Becky was heartbroken but a part of her was hopeful to see if his words were true. She believed because she loved him. But what she said was also true she didn't feel like if she could trust him anymore. Only time would tell. Okay this is the end of this chapter please review and give ideas on what you want to see in the next chapter and don't worry Wendy will begin her plan for Spike and Becky. Will she succeed? Read on to find out. Until next post. Thanks Readnwritelover. ","Summary":" You Love ME! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Disclaimer: I own nothing!

There I was it was finally winter break and Christmas was a few days away uncle Kevin and Dad had settled their differences and were closer than they had ever been. Not that I was complaining but we have been working all day trying to get everything ready for the Christmas party the O'Shea family started having for friends and family before actual Christmas was here. Due to the fact that not all family could come on the actual Christmas or needed to be home by that time it became a tradition to celebrate two weeks before Christmas that way more people could come. Because we like a more closed environment and family time during Christmas this was also very convenient. Guests would be coming in about four hours and things were still hectic Aunt Karen was freaking out and Uncle Kevin was on the receiving end; again. Not that they did it a lot but this happened a lot when Aunt Karen wanted things to go great and only during Christmas did this happen rarely on other occasions. She had both Debbie and me decorating and Priscilla Debbie's little sister was in charge of the Christmas tree. My dad and my stepmom Patty (Did I mention that they got married four years ago? Well they did), were helping out as well Patty and Aunt Karen were in charge of Catering making sure everything was going well in the kitchen and that all the food was there. Dad and Uncle Kevin were outside decorating the front Doors and putting Christmas lights on a now empty lot that uncle kev and dad had that was used just for this occasion. Jr well what can I say I know I had a crush on him when I saw him at the supermarket heck I even surprised myself. **Flashback** Man these donuts are good. There is nothing like powdered donuts. What was that, flying toilet paper? Hanen: \"What an arm!\" Zolteck: \"What a find!\" \" What a HUNK! Wait a minute what am I saying! I'm the Icebox! The Icebox doesn't like boys! Except for that one!\" (DUCK) JR: \"Ey buddy… Catch this\" Tad: \"He caught it!\" Jr: \"Good Catch!\" Hanen: \"Nice Arm!\" Jr: \"Jr Floyd\" Hanen: \"I'm Hanen\" Zolteck: \"Zolteck\" Jr: \"What's up?\" Tad: \"I'm tad!\" Jr: \"Cool!\" Zolteck: \"You wanna play some football\" Hanen: \"yeah, let's see that arm again!\" Where is he? Boo! ***END Flashback*** Man that was embarrassing having all that isle fall on me and the guys laughing at me the \"ICEBOX\" whoa but I grew out my crush Debbie didn't she's going out with him even though she has to wait till the weekends to see him or rarely during the week. It's a good thing that she grew out of the spoiled princess stage she was in or else we wouldn't be best friends today. Don't get me wrong we like different things and have different friends, but hey we are family, Right? Right! Jr finally having finished finals for the first semester of university came home to be with the family of course with Debbie is where he spends most of his time right now they need to catch up but he still finds time to hang with the boys. I'm still one of them, the LITTLE GIANTS but in a more girly version aunt Karen and Debbie helped out! How else was I gonna get a boyfriend not that I've had too much luck in the department but I'm happy I'm in the football team to a female one, I found some girls that were willing to play and well what can I say we are Champion three years running ! Getting back to the party the \"adults\" were in charge of the guest list, we had some input don't get me wrong my friends were coming but I don't know who else and I was getting nervous this was beginning to feel like a circus, getting bigger by the moment. Three and a half hours later I was talking with some friends from the football teams (male and female) and them I turn around and who do I see …. Johnny and his dad I walk up to him followed by the others and welcome him back to Urbania and to the team. We are talking a million miles at a time all of us surrounding him when I hear that voice saying… ****: Hello… what about my welcome? Please review and thank you for reading. Sorry it took me so long to post but I have a lot of stuff to do.

Whoa I think my heart just stopped it was him the one I've been thinking about. I remember the first time I saw him my dad brought him to the little giants. Of course he didn't like me right of the bat as soon as he found out I was JUST a girl or a \"berserk Barbie doll\" not that I looked like a Barbie doll all dressed up in football gear I looked like one of the guys. But the time I saw him there was something about him that caught my eye, what it was I didn't know at the time back then I was infatuated with Jr. But still there was something about the way he looked at me. Nothing about competition and a game to prove that I wasn't worthy of playing football or being on his team. Now as I am starring at him dumbstruck I am wondering who invited him. Then I hear Jr. Jr: Hey man glad you made it I almost thought you wouldn't come! Spike: I'm doing ok you know my dad we finally decided to move back home so we are still moving in. He's moving back? What now I have a million questions running through my mind. When did Spike become so buddy-buddy Jr and vice versa. I mean I knew they were civil to each other but now they were acting like best friends. The others were welcoming him and all that and I just stayed back still confused, just then Debbie walks up to me and asks, Debbie: Are you ok you are looking pale, is it because Spike is here? Debbie was the only one that knew of my thing for Spike. He had visited before but moving back? I don't know how I'm gonna handle this. ME: \"Yeah… I mean I'm fine, I am just really confused, since when does Jr talk and is close to Spike?\" Debbie: \"I don't know I mean he was talk about a friend from school that he was excited about coming, someone from the football team. I guess that's who he was talking about but he never mentioned a name. I guess we now know why.\" ME: \"Hmmm! that's weird I mean he didn't say anything and Patty didn't mention anything either.\" As I'm talking to Debbie someone taps my shoulder. \"Hi Becky\" he says, I turn around and he has a smile on his face. \"Hi\" I reply back. \"You remember Debbie my cousin and Jr's Girlfriend right?\" He looks at Debbie and shakes her hand, \"Hi, Merry Christmas\" \"Hi, Merry Christmas to you too\", Debbie answers back. \"SO\" I say,\" what brings you back to Urbania?\" \"Well\" he says, \"Just some dreams I wanna make come true\" What kind of dreams would he need to come true? \"Really that's interesting\", I say back. He smiles making me feel nervous inside that's the thing about him his smiles are so rare that you kinda wish he would smile all the time at you. \"Yeah, also my dad wanted to move back to Urbania, he said it's a good place to retire, really peaceful.\" he says smiling again. \"So where is your ...\" i didn't get to finish because just then Patty comes and asks me to help her with something. \"Sorry\" I say. \"Why don't you hang out with the guys, I mean they seem to like you all of a sudden.\" Then I turn around leaving him surprised at my comment. I don't look back when Jr is making conversation with him again. All this is really weird and i need to know what is going on here. SOrry it's a little short!

PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 4: Memories Everyone is having fun who would have thought that MY DAD and my UNCLE Kevin would be able to throw a successful party it they worked together; I mean those two were inseparable now. Well not all the time dad had to spend time with Patty and and Uncle Kevin had to spend time with Aunt Karen as well as Spending time with Debbie and Priscilla (Cilla) for Short. There we are dancing the night away Cilla is dancing with me next to Johnny and Tad who I am very happy to see. Jr and Debbie are dancing together and from the corner of my eye I see Spike staring at me while he's a corner next to his dad who is hanging out with most of the adult males who decided not to dance for a while. I can't help but feel nervous that Spike is looking at me; but I keep dancing none the less then another song comes up it's a song that my dad liked because as he said he could dance this song with me. I know that if I ever get married this would be our father- daughter dance song. My dad walks up to me and asks… Danny: \"May I have this dance young lady?\" I can't help but smile at him and accept taking his hand. For all those times you stood by me For all the truth that you made me see For all the joy you brought to my life For all the wrong that you made right For every dream you made come true For all the love I found in you I'll be forever thankful baby You're the one who held me up Never let me fall You're the one who saw me through it all During this time all my memories of my dad and me come to me and I'm happy about most of them. When he taught me to walk, You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith 'coz you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me When he taught me to speak, You gave me wings and made me fly You touched my hand I could touch the sky I lost my faith, you gave it back to me You said no star was out of reach You stood by me and I stood tall I had your love I had it all I'm grateful for each day you gave me Maybe I don't know that much But I know this much is true I was blessed because I was loved by you Even the time when he tried to explain about my monthly but in the end gave up and called Aunt Karen, You were always there for me The tender wind that carried me A light in the dark shining your love into my life You've been my inspiration Through the lies you were the truth My world is a better place because of you Man that day was embarrassing for the both of us. Luckily it all turned all well. But the MOST memorable time when I'm blessed that he is my dad is when without me telling him and even taken but surprise he helped us with the pee wee football team against the cowboys. As the song finishes I look at his face and he looks proud of me … really proud of me and in my heart I am really proud that he is my dad and that I could be here today and tell him what's in my heart… ***: \"daddy I LOVE YOU! Thank you for everything you have ever done for me! Merry Christmas\" I don't want to say more because then I will be teary eyed and that isn't good for my rep. Danny: \"I love you too! And I am very proud of you and happy that you are my daughter. Merry Christmas baby\" I am so happy just being with my dad that I don't notice the song is fully over and people are dancing around us some are staring among them is guess who…? SPIKE… I thank my dad and walk over to Debbie who looks quite worked up I guess she was observing dad and me that she got emotional. So I give her a hug some are surprised because hey… I'm the ICEBOX I don't get emotional. But hey what can me say but… ***: \"its Christmas get over it\" They smile at me. Some are still surprised but they'll get over it. ***: \"man I'm thirsty are there any drinks around here?\" I wonder. Debbie: \"There is some in the kitchen\" Okay As I walk over and as I'm about to enter the kitchen I feel a hand on my shoulder sopping my journey. It's nobody else but … Cliffhanger… or is it? ***Thanks to all of you who are reading my FanFic I will post as soon as possible and to ensure that I post please review as will then be sure that you guys like it Au revoir! :)[Chapter 5] ~*** Sorry I have not written anything in a while I have been working but more importantly I have had a terrible case of writers block and I was trying to look for inspiration I will try to put up another chapter before the end of the week .***~ You Love Who? **** Hey everybody this is my first FanFic Ever I was reading this story by a writer here and I kind of got inspired.

Debbie: \"There is some in the kitchen\" Okay As I walk over and as I'm about to enter the kitchen I feel a hand on my shoulder sopping my journey. It's nobody else but … Cliffhanger… or is it CHAPTER 5: The GAME You guessed it; it was indeed Spike Hammersmith. Spike: \"Hi…\" ***: \"Um… Hi\" Spike: \"So you thirsty?\" ***: \"Uhh yeah I was on my way to get something to drink actually.\" Spike: \"Mind if I join you?\" ***: \"Not at all\" What else can I say to him I don't want to be rude, I think to myself. So we are walking into the kitchen and I see none other than Jr and Debbie kissing. Gross seeing my stepbrother and my cousin kissing, wait not kissing but in fact making out. ***: \"Ahem\" They break apart embarrassed and red cheeks looking down. I can't help but find it amused that they act this way. Debbie: \"Um… hi. What are you guys doing here?\" ***: \"Oh nothing I mean what else can you do in the kitchen?\" She flushes again and I can't help but laugh it's so funny. ***: \"Actually we were looking for something to drink.\" Jr: \"The drinks are in the fridge\" It so funny to me what he says I start laughing again I guess they don't notice. Jr: \"what is so funny?\" he says looking at spike. Spike: \"You guys are standing in front of the fridge\" he says giving a small smirk that I so surprised because I have never seen a smirk like that coming from him that is full of humor like that the last time I saw it was at the Cowboys vs. Giants game and it was more like I'm laughing at you smirk or a take that smirk. They finally moved out of the way and we get our drinks then I hear something that just embarrasses me … my dad wanting to show everyone the game where the cowboys play the Giants. Debbie and look at each other wondering what uncle Kev is going to do we know that he will definitely have something to say about it. I am surprised that the O'Shea brothers my dad and my uncle Kevin did not argue about the game that I think even Aunt Karen and everyone else that knows them were in awe. Their reason for watching the tape now turned DVD was that they wanted to remember the good days now that everyone was there. But what made more commotion was the bets that were made because of that game; the one that the elderly citizens made when they phoned my dad and Uncle Kevin about Spike. Who could also forget about the bet that Uncle Kevin and dad made at the game putting his car dealer against my dad's gas station. Overall everything was fun and memories. As I sat down in one of the chairs listening to everyone laugh at the anecdotes and overall funny stories, also watching some old clips of people around the community growing up even luckily pieces of the game, I noticed that spike was sitting next to me that's when I finally noticed him fully and I noticed that he had changed over the time that I had not seen him. He was more rugged looking and tall, very well built which made me nervous to notice, he was also quite attractive not in the bad boy way that he used to have, no he was more mature looking he dressed more like a man in college than a teenager just wanting to play football and working out. That's when I noticed that he was dressed semi casual in black dress pants and red dress shirt something so unSpike like how I remembered he also was sporting a very manly 9 o'clock shadow which made him dangerous looking and a very masculine way like we would just grab you and carry you to the sunset. Wait a minute newsflash I DON'T LIKE HIM, DO I? I'm so confused. I keep stealing looks at him trying to make him out. Why is he following me around, I mean can't hew hang out with one of the boys, there is always Jr they could talk about football and stuff. I mean I like football to but I'm sure he would more in common with Jr. They could talk about girls. Just thinking about him thinking about other girls make my stomach have this weird feeling what would make me feel this way. Then he does something that he has never done for me… He smiled at me. Not like the one where he tackled Jr and then smiled very smugly like saying take that. On the contrary it's a genuine smile like saying hi or we're friends. Which confuses me even more because we are not friends at all? He left we could not be friends he did not grow with us and watch Urbania become more modernized but somehow still feeling like home with the same people knowing everything about you and trying to meddle which was what they still tried to do from time to time when one of the ladies from town would try to set me up with a nephew or a grandson because as they said I was to lonely. What do they know I'm still young it not like I'll remain a spinster. Right? As the night came to an end I was walking towards the kitchen I was thinking about everything involving Spike and wondering why he all of a sudden was looking at me but not saying anything. Then out of nowhere I crashed into something big and solid. It almost knocked me down; suddenly I was wrapped up in two strong muscular arms that prevented me from falling down. That is when I realized that the one who was holding me in a very protective way and staring down at me with a worried look in his eyes was none other than… I will continue soon before the end of the week. Please comment and send me ideas so that I could post more soon. Leave a review.

PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 6: Mistletoe I have to admit seeing a new side of Spike is confusing me I was so used to the competitive Spike that this one just surprises me. He's more down to earth, dresses like a normal person would wear not like before always in jerseys and sports stuff. He is making me really nervous though once in a while I have this feeling, this prickling feeling in the back of my neck and when I see who it is it's none other than Spike starring a me with his big brown soulful looking eyes that just make feel all gooey inside and that somehow confuses me more. I can't help but feel butterflies in my stomach he make me feel like we are the only two people in the room when he is staring at me and see him there is no one but us too here. In the living the party is thinning out that there are a few people left so now it's just really close friends talking or getting ready to leave that there is just Debbie Aunt Karen and I picking up whatever we can now so that we have less to do later. Jr is with our friends talking to them about other Guy stuff that I'm frankly not interested in. As I'm going to the kitchen I feel a tap in my shoulder. Turning around I'm almost knocked down by a powerful force, that force being Spike Hammersmith. Spike: Sorry did I startle you. Speaking as he helps me with trash I was taking to the back where the rest of the trash was accumulating ***: yeah sorry. Almost getting lost in his eyes He keeps looking at me like he wants to say something but he still can't come out and say it. He looks at me weird that I have to ask. ***: are you Oks Spike: yeah I'm good . He says ***: Oh ok Spike: need any help with that , he asks *** Um sure, I say As I lead the way he keeps smiling down at me. I can't help but blush and hope that I'm not to obvious this is just embarrassing. But I smile back and tell him where to put the trash. As we are going in to the house again he stops me at the door and he seem kind of nervous like he doesn't know how to starts I help along the conversation by asking him ***: Are you ok I ask? Spike: Yeah, but this is kind of hard to say , he says ***: What? I ask Spike: I was wondering if you were going to watch the game tomorrow He's speaking so fast that I cannot understand him and ask ***: what? I can't understand you Spike: sorry that came out wrong what I meant to say was will you go to the movies with me I was so shocked that I just stood there and stared at him. He looked nervous and afraid somehow that I still can't react still trying to read him and trying to figure where that came from that he starts to speak. Spike: If you don't want to its ok you don't have too. Just as I was going to say something I hear somebody shout out ^^^: look who's under the mistletoe it was Tad running back inside I heard that and automatically looking up. We were underneath the mistletoe, right away I was red faced and didn't know what to think. Worse of all what would Spike be thinking right this minute. As I looked at him trying to gauge his reaction to the fact that we were indeed underneath the mistletoe, he was not reacting the way at had imagined he would be. He didn't look disgusted or terrified even upset or angry. No, what I saw in his eyes were shyness wonder and there I say it anticipation. What surprised me even more was that I could sort of read his reactions. I don't know maybe I'm reading too much into this or maybe I'm being to hopeful and I'm seeing that isn't there or something that I may be feeling myself but will not admit even to myself. For some reason we start to lean into each other staring into each other's eyes and I can't help but feel excited in a way. I wonder what do his lips taste like, how would they feel on mine. then I don't have to wonder anymore because suddenly his lips are touching mine moving against mine and its like I'm in heaven and I hear the fireworks somewhere. Seconds or minutes or even hours pass and we start to break apart I feel like shouting and jumping up and down that this is the BEST kiss I've ever had. I mean my first kiss with that cute boy that moved from Kansas because of his father's job does not compare to this kiss it's like I was never kissed anyway because suddenly I'm like a whole new person with new experiences. As I'm again starring into his eyes I can't tell what he is thinking anymore and my high and excitement of the kiss turns to nerves. What is he feeling?[Chapter 7] ~*** I got Inspired and decided to post another chapter to make up for the fact that I haven't posted one in a while thanks for being patient.

PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 7: Reactions Spike: Wow, did you hear the fireworks? Wow? Di he just say wow. Whew I was worried. ***: What fireworks I said. Spike: The ones in my head. They were so loud I thought everyone could hear them. I smiled at him. He kept looking at me. ***What ? I said Spike: Nothing, take a walk with me please . I didn't know how to think at that moment that I think I just reacted and nodded my head. We walk admiring the lights that decorated the homes of many neighbor Uncle Kevin had. They were beautiful decorations. They reflect how I felt during this time of year. Cheerful and homey. As we neared a bench in the park he stopped and looked at me. Then he said something I would never thing that would come out of Spike's wonderful full sexy lips. Spike: Please go out with me? Suddenly I got chills on my back and he reacted. Spike Are you cold I'm sorry I forgot we were just taking out the trash. That when I remembered that all I was wearing were Comfortable Black Dressy pants that were line with a thermal layer. And a really warm Blouse the color reflecting the Christmas season colors, Red. I was wearing a Light jacket but it had no match to the cold weather. Suddenly I realized that I was cold. So he did something that again surprised me and took off his own heavy jacket and put it over my shoulders. ***: Won't you be cold? I asked. Spike: No he said. Well he wouldn't be since he was wearing heavier clothes than me. Tan Slacks and snow boots covered his lower half of the body. The other half consisting of a warm red plaid flannel shirt and on top of that he had another jacket and the heavy snow jacket he was wearing that he put on me. His jacket smelled just like him but inhaling his scent made feel butterflies in my stomach I really like how he smelled. ***: Oh, well thank you, I forgot to get my jacket since I was just taking out the trash I didn't think I would need it. Oh that reminds me I need to get back my dad is probably looking for me wondering where I've gone. As I started to run back home he stopped me once again and looked into my eyes saying. Spike: You didn't answer my question will you go out with me…. To the movies I mean or anywhere else you would like. As I thought about it I just answered what I've been wanting to say since he asked that exciting question. ***: Yes, I would love to. That is when he did the unexpected and hugged me raising me up in the air and laughing. His laugh made me laugh in return and was smiling at him when he finally put me down kissing me on the lips again. It was a small peck but it meant everything to me. He then grabbed my hand and led me back home. Entering the house my dad walked up to me and said Danny: I was looking for you where were you? ***: I was out taking a small walk with Spike. Danny: Really. He said whispering in my ear as he hugged me keeping me close to his chest. Making me feel at home and loved. I hugged him back it had been a while since he hugged me like that. Like if I was the most important thing in his life and he didn't want to see me hurt. We broke apart and he looks into my eyes his own eyes smiling and said, Danny: That's nice. But you guys must be cold it's freezing outside He led us to the fireplace where people where talking and drink hot chocolate with marshmallows MMM my favorite. He left us and came back with two mugs of hot chocolate mine with a lot of marshmallows. My dad was the best he knew me so well he knew how I liked my chocolate; hot and full of marshmallows. *** Thanks Dad. Danny: Anytime sweetie. The rest of the night was passed with everyone talking and laughing enjoying their time together as a family. Still Spike would throw glances at me and smile at me when I would meet his gaze. Hopefully nobody noticed. Little did I know that I was sooo wrong. Thanks for reading I will try to post again soon. Please review.[Chapter 8] ~*** I got Inspired and decided to post another chapter to make up for the fact that I haven't posted one in a while thanks for being patient.

PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 8: The Date The rest of the night was passed with everyone talking and laughing enjoying their time together as a family. Still Spike would throw glances at me and smile at me when I would meet his gaze. Hopefully nobody noticed. Little did I know that I was sooo wrong? I had no Idea what I would wear I didn't feel feminine enough what did I have that was sexy, something that would attract him. By him I mean Spike that really hot guy had asked ME out. I still can't believe it. Right now my worries were what to wear. Should I wear red or blue; short or long? Hair down or up? I don't really own many heals it's not much my style, you know me being a sports chicks what can I do. Many Hours later….. Actually just 45 minutes but it felt like hours I found a red dress that Patty gave me for my birthday. I tried it on; it still fit. This was a wonderful dress something that I would never really have thought of wearing. It was an of the shoulder one side strapped dress in red that came to the lower thigh close to the knee but not quite there. It was perfect now that I think about it show plenty of leg without being sleazy it hugged my body perfectly and made me feel sexy. This dress would definitely knock him off his socks. This is exactly what I want his reaction to be; speechless and something that will make this date memorable. As I put on my dress I felt the red silk glide down my body, I'm thinking of the shoes Debbie lent that went really well with the dress, I just hope I don't fall with how tall they are 5 inch heels more than I'm used to. Somehow I know I will manage. Debbie also helped me with my hair and makeup. Its times like this that I am thankful that I have a cousin who loves girly stuff. Now that I'm ready I hear a knock on my door. ***: come in. Patty: You look beautiful. ***: Thanks. Thank you for the dress and for everything that you've done. (And she's done a lot especially working with my dad with all the shock) Patty: Your welcome I just came to tell you to have I good time and that I just know you with shock Spike. I don think he would have imagined you to look like this. ***: thanks I just hope he like it As Patty Debbie and I were talking for about 5 Minutes I finally heard the door bell suddenly I was so excited. And scared. And Nervous. I was feeling so many things that I couldn't even feel my legs anymore and I didn't know how I was going to move to the door especially since I had to walk down the stairs first. Suddenly I heard my dad call my name announcing that Spike was here. Thankfully Debbie and Patty were still here to give me a little push in the right direction. Literally. I guess they saw my facial expressions. Walking down the stairs I noticed Spike looking at me. Well more like staring in shock. Spike: You look … He couldn't even finish, I guess I definitely surprised him. Thank you I told him as he handed me some beautiful red roses, how did he know my favorite were red roses. I guess somebody has been speaking with Jr. Spike: should we go now. ***: sure. He led me out the door to his car. Open my door, then we were on our way. I had no idea where we were going. Soon we arrived at the restaurant. A really nice looking restaurant that was family owned it was called Donatello's it reminded me of the Ninja turtles. The maitre'd led us to our table, a secluded area that was romantic looking. Our orders were taken and Spike and I were doing small talk he asked me some questions, I asked him some questions. We found out we had many things in common other that sports. We had movies in common as well as some music. Over all the date was going wonderfully. As he paid for dinner he held my chair for me and put my jacket over my shoulders, I had never pegged him for a gentleman like this. We got on his car and drove away from the small restaurant. He told me he had a surprise for me. That was a first; nobody had ever bothered to give me and actual surprise not even my dad, not even for my birthday. He told me to close my eyes and I did, as he was driving he would tease me about peeking, we laughed and he told me we were almost there. \" Where are we going? \" I asked. \" You'll see \", He said. I was more excited by the minute and anxious. I just couldn't wait for my surprise. \" We're here .\" he said. He led me out of the car and led me somewhere for a couple of steps. \" Open your eyes \", he said. When I open I saw the most wonderful view. We were on top of a mountain everything was pretty much dark except for all the lights of the town. The view was breath taking. There were no words to describe what I saw. \" How did you find this place ?\" I asked. \" One day I was just driving around and I found this place my accident, do you like it? \" he asked. \"I love it\", I told him. Na d I meant it. \"Thank you\", I said after a couple of minutes of starring at the view. We were so into the view, let me correct that, I was enjoying the view and I didn't notice Spike starring at me until I turned to thank him again. \"What?\" I said. Nothing you look beautiful\" he said. At that moment I hoped he think notice me blush and I was thankful that it was somewhat dark for him to see because for some reason that did indeed make ME blush; ME , the Icebox. If anybody else saw me they would be making fun of me. But thank fully it was just Spike and I. He kept starring at me, I turned to look at him and I was captivated by his eyes I had never seen them this way, full of emotion like he wanted to say something but could say it. Then something wonderful happen he started to lean into me. Oh did he start to lean towards me, then without me thinking about it I was leaning too, our eyes locked, and then briefly he would look at my lips and look at my eyes again. Finally or lips touched, just touch. His lips then started to move a little bit more his tongue then would skim my lips as if tasting them. He became bold and would touch his tongue to me, finally I opened my mouth, he invaded it tasting me and letting me taste him. He definitely tasted good as we were kissing I felt like if I was floating in the clouds and there were fireworks all around us. We kiss for what felt like forever. Finally needing air we broke apart, he put his forehead resting on mine and said, \"Wow\". Wow indeed there is nothing like that kiss. No one had ever kissed me like that, so passionately. We stood there for about an hour just talking and holding hands. Once in a while he would give small kisses. This was the best Date EVER. Please Review this is my longest post so far I got really Inspired and O hope you like. Sorry for not posting sooner, I just wanted it to be perfect. THANX TO ALL Happy Holidays[Chapter 9] ~*** I got Inspired and decided to post another chapter to make up for the fact that I haven't posted one in a while thanks for being patient. Thanks for reading. ***~ You Love Who? ***Special thanks to all the readers of this fanfic*** Disclaimer: I OWN NOTHING Thanks to those who reviewed. Sorry for not updating sooner I had no access to a computer for a while. Chapter 9: He Pops the Question. My date with Spike was the best date ever one that I know I would remember for the rest of my life. That kiss we shared was unlike any other, not like I've had many but still, he made me feel things I have never felt. I felt for the first time like a female, a WOMAN. A very sexy woman at that. ;) We sat in the hood of his car and just stared at the sky. I had my head on his shoulder and he would sometimes kiss my forehead or my nose making my nose tickle and would laugh or smile and he would smile with me. His smile would be something I would remember forever as well because he was not the time to generally smile other people might be afraid but I was in awe. We talked about his football training his previous coaches, were he used to live. He even mentioned that Urbania was the one place where for the first time he felt at home. Joking around with I agreed with him saying, Urbania is the place where I am at home too. He told me if we should go somewhere else to walk and talk some more because it was getting darker in the mountain. I agreed and he took me to the movies which would be dark but hey he planned the date we saw and action movie that had some violence that would sometimes creep me out so I would at moments hold on to his arm more that I would normally not do with any other guy. We still held hands and he got us popcorn and some drinks. At one particular moment in the movie he leaned in to me and looked into my eyes and kissed me in the lips. I was a really tender kiss that I felt all the way to my toes. I would never tire if his kisses, they were like magic. I wished these moments would never end but at the same times I wish there were more moments like these that I would cherish and tell my kids and grandkids about. As I was thinking this, I thought even more and wondered why I would be thinking of kids after all I was still pretty much a kid myself. Maybe it was just the fantasy of it all. Of having someone to tell these experiences to. Coming out of the theater we walked around town the streets were pretty much deserted of families at this time except for a few other couples that we out on dates or something. We walked and he led me to the park where we sat in the swings. There he told me that he had something to ask me. He looked plenty nervous which in turn made me nervous because what would have to be nervous about. I listen to what he said and was shocked to silence. \"Becky, Iceboxx I have known you since I was younger and there were many things that I was confused about when I met you. You did some things that I has never witnessed a girl do and that confused me. You played football like the other boys if not better, I take that back you definitely played better than the other boys. But at that time I was into this belief that girls could not do the kinds of things that boys could. But you proved me wrong and the more I got to play with you the more in common I found with you and the more I liked you and about you. We had some much in common back then. You were so competitive like me but I would learn from that because your came out of fun for the game and about being in a team. From then on I found more things about you that I liked, then as I grew I would simply be fascinated by the girl that was you beautiful, athletic, smart, and above all with a big heart. Then I moved away and could stop thinking about you, about those things that you might be doing, if you were still the you I remembered. The good thing is that I became friends with Jr and I kept tabs on you without knowing. He would send pictures and some of them had you in it and got actually looked forward to his letters or email to see if he would send more pictures mostly because I hoped you were in them. Without knowing or realizing I began to grow feeling for you much deeper than that of a friend or a teammate I fell in L: O: V: E with you. And so my question is you, as I look into your beautiful brown eyes is … WOULD YOU BECKY O'SHEA BE MY GIRLFRIEND.\" I could not believe everything he said to me it was like a dream; a really wonderful dream. I was in full shock for a few minutes that he started to grow nervous I could tell but couldn't respond. He then did something that shocked me even more. He kissed me with pent up passion and hope that once more I saw stars and fireworks at the same time, if that is even possible. He then told me, \"If you don't feel the same I would understand.\" At that moment when he said that I finally knew what I had to do. I hugged him and wound my arms around his neck pulling his head towards mine and kissed him how I wanted to kiss him. Our breathes mixed and our kiss was full of so much love that it seemed like minutes until we needed air that we broke apart and finally I said to him the words we both wanted to hear. \" YES \" I told him and we kissed once more forever remembering this one moment in time.

Characters: Thumbelina/Jacquimo Universe: off-canon Summary: Ever wonder why Jacquimo didn't just fly Thumbelina to her house at the beginning of the movie? ~0~ \"You wait right here, Thumbelina chiquitita. We'll be right back with the padre.\" \"Oh, no, no. See, I love Cornelius.\" \"Today, you marry my son.\" \"Yay!\" \"Oh no, no, no. No, I'm not marrying-No, come back here. No now, wait a second! W-Where are you going?\" Growing frustrated at her situation, Thumbelina couldn't help but cry out \"Doesn't anybody care what I think?\" before she fell over on her bottom. Aggressively throwing her hair back over her head and standing up, Thumbelina let out a grunt of anger. She didn't ask for this! Why did the toads have to take her?! Surely she wasn't the only talented being out there! And what was with that Grundel character wanting to marry her? She didn't even know him! Determined to get away before the awful toads came back, Thumbelina looked around for any possible escape route, but sadly didn't see any. Swimming seemed to be the only way off and gazing in dismay at the water surrounding her lily pad, Thumbelina lamented her inability to swim or even float. If only she could swim toward the shore than maybe she could've found her way home. Seeing the impossibility of getting off the lily pad that way, Thumbelina turned to the only other option left for her. \"Help!\" Thumbelina bellowed as loud as she could. \"Can anyone help me? Please!\" Turning every which direction, Thumbelina continued to call out, growing more desperate as minutes rolled by, until a figure grew closer over head. Waiting for it to draw closer, Thumbelina took in a huge gulp of air before yelling once again, \"Help!\" She breathed a breath of relief when she got the attention of what she now saw was a bird. \"Woah, woah. Help? Who is saying help?\" replied the bird. \"Mr. Bird, over here!\" Thumbelina yelled as she jumped around to show him where she was. She blushed in embarrassment when she fell over again. \"Oh! Oh, little one. Are you having a bad day?\" \"I was sleeping on my windowsill, waiting for Prince Cornelius to come back, and he said he would come before morning because he loves me and-\" \"He loves you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Congratulations!\" \"Thanks. But, well...But I was stolen away by Mrs. Toad who says I have to marry her son and I just-\" \"A toad? Ptooey! Toad.\" The bird spit in disgust. \"That is a very bad day Mademoiselle. Uh, Mademoiselle...\" \"Thumbelina.\" \"Ah, Thumbelina, I am Jacquimo. How can I be of service to you?\" \"Well, I must get off this lily pad, but that's impossible.\" Thumbelina replied, as she fell over again. Jacquimo laughed. \"Ha ha ha! Nothing is impossible.\" Launching off the plant he stood on, Jacquimo aimed for the lily pad in front of him, and successfully dunked half of the lily pad in such a way that the other half launched Thumbelina in the air. Flapping his arms quickly, he raised his body until he was under the falling girl, and deftly caught her on his back. \"Voila!\" Taking a moment to catch her breath from the scare of the launch, Thumbelina, amazed, replied \"Oh my. Well, that was easy.\" \"As I said nothing is impossible!\" Jacquimo exclaimed with enthusiasm, making Thumbelina giggle. \"Now where would you like to go, Thumbelina?\" the helpful bird asked. \"Oh, uh... Let's see,\" hummed Thumbelina, looking around her surroundings until she spotted a couple of houses off in the distance. Pointing in the general direction, Thumbelina implored, \"There! Do you think you can take me to those houses? I think I can see my house from here.\" Looking at where she gestured, Jacquimo replied \"No problem, Mademoiselle! Et c'est parti\" and aimed for her home. \"You're sure to do impossible thing...\" Arriving at her windowsill less than five minutes later, Thumbelina sighed in relief and slid off her new friend. \"Oh, I can't thank you enough, Jacquimo! Thank you. Thank you so much!\" Thumbelina exclaimed giving a big hug to her savior. Jacquimo patted her back. \"Say no more, Thumbelina. I am glad to help.\" Backing away, taking off his hat, and bowing to her, Jacquimo bid her \"Au revoir!\" before flying away. Waving goodbye enthusiastically, Thumbelina grinned, and turned to enter through her open window. Her smile fell when she noticed Hero in the corner of her room, wallowing in grief, and what sounded like sobbing coming from down below. \"Oh Hero! Don't cry!\"[Chapter 2] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Waking Up Characters: Cornelius/Jitterbugs Universe: Canon Summary: Waking up to the news of your dream girl marrying someone else was the worst thing ever. ~0~ Waking up to the news of your dream girl marrying someone else was the worst thing ever. The last thing Cornelius could recall was a bone-chilling wind pelting Buzzby and him as he searched the forests for his love. Although he had asked for his parents to delay the winter frost, he knew there wasn't much they could do. Mother nature simply did not allow for it. But even still, this year's winter seemed more ferocious than any others before it, almost like it didn't want him to find his future princess. Being pelted by a never-ending blizzard was nothing to laugh about. Especially when said blizzard caused his bumble to lose control of his flight, and eventually pushing him into the freezing lake below him. Normally fairies are resilient to the winter they help create, but so cold was the water that even he couldn't escape hits grip in time. It's a good thing fairies can't naturally freeze to death or else, he would be a goner. And speaking of goner, if the Jitterbugs were to be believed - of who he had no reason to doubt - then everyone this side of the vale thought that he was dead. That thought filled him with dread, cause if everyone thought he was dead - and were talking about it - than Thumbelina would undoubtedly hear and think he was de- \"Thumbelina's getting married to Mr. Mole!\" yelled out the youngest Jitterbug. \"Gnatty!\" cried the other two. \"What did you say?\" shouted Cornelius in shock. The elder two of the Jitterbugs looked at him nervously, whilst the youngest continued on unabated, \"After the beetle took her away, this big ugly toad stopped us and said that he wanted Thumbelina back, but he was scary so we ran away. But then the toad and the beetle became friends and the beetle found you frozen and brought you to the toad and said that he found Thumbelina and that she was buried alive with the mole and the toad said that he was going to save her and he took the beetle with him but he left you here and we wanted to help so we built a fire and now you're here!\" Gnatty finished with a deep gulp of air as he said the whole story on one breath. Cornelius couldn't wrap his head around it. The toad he knew about, and the beetle too, but what was this about a mole? How many people were after his Thumbelina? It's unbelievable how much trouble his girl has gotten into. At least now he has an idea of where she would be. \"Is this mole the one rich, educated one that never comes out of the ground?\" Cornelius asked. \"That's the one!\" replied Gnatty happily. Cornelius sighed in relief, so he definitely knew where Thumbelina was. Now all he had to do was go rescue her from this loveless marriage - cause that's what it was - and take her home to meet his parents so they could live \"happily ever after\", as she said. And much, much longer , he added in his head. Looking determinedly down at the expectant Jitterbugs, Cornelius exclaimed, \"Come on. Let's go save Thumbelina!\" to which the Jitterbugs answered with yells of excitement. Hold on just a little longer, Thumbelina. Wait for me.[Chapter 3] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Kidnapped Characters: Mama Toad/Thumbelina/Hero Universe: Canon Summary: Thumbelina's point of view of her kidnapping ~0~ Thumbelina dozed happily in her nut bed that night. Earlier in the night, a wonderful fairy prince had come fluttering through her window, an answer to her hopes of finding other people her same size in the world. She had initially only hoped for companionship but after her flight with the boy across the meadow behind her house, Thumbelina hoped for a happily ever after with her new love. Falling asleep only a few hours later, Thumbelina dreamed of a future surrounded by little people, all with wings on their backs, and her fairy prince standing by her side. In her dreams, she imagined being welcomed warmly by the other winged creatures despite being wingless herself. She would be accepted by her love's parents and would make wonderful new friends. Years of happiness and laughter would follow, and perhaps two little children would complete the little family. Oh yes, she couldn't wait until morning came and brought with it her prince on his bumble. She certainly didn't expect to not be there to welcome him at her home, however. Suddenly feeling her bed shift, Thumbelina looked up in time to see the top of her bed closing in around her. Complete darkness settled upon her, and in confusion and fear, Thumbelina cried out for her family dog to save her. \"Hey! Hey, help! Help, Hero! Let me out of here!\" Suddenly her bed was suspended in the air, and in consequence so did she. Holding her forehead after it bumped roughly against the nut wall, Thumbelina continued to yell, \"Oh, Hero! Hero, help! Help me!\" Why wasn't he answering her? Not two seconds after she thought that, she heard a familiar growl and a bark. Her bed got jostled again. \"Oh, a dog!\" said the person kidnapping her. Another growl and her kidnapper yelled, \"Ay! Get away from me!\" Thumbelina tried not to cry out in pain as she was continually thrown and manhandled while trapped in her bed. But then after feeling weightless one more time... It all went black. She awoke slowly who knows how long after to a pounding headache. Grabbing her head in her hands, Thumbelina opened her eyes only to quickly shut them when a bean of sunlight hit her pupils. She groaned. Opening her eyes slowly this time, her eyes slowly adjusted to see... ...a pond? \" Bueno dias . I hope you sleep very, very good.\" said a voice from her left. Thumbelina gasped, turning to see a female toad wearing a red nightgown and cap. \"Huh? Uh, w-who are you?\"[Chapter 4] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Origins Characters: Thumbelina/Cornelius Universe: Post-canon Summary: How old is Thumbelina anyway? ~0~ \"Thumbelina?\" Turning at the sound of his voice, Thumbelina looked to see her beloved gazing at her questionably. \"Yes, Cornelius?\" \"I know I told you I was sixteen years old, but you never told me how old you were.\" Sitting up, Cornelius rubbed his chin. \"I don't even know when your birthday is!\" he said, shocked. \"Oh... well,\" she started, biting her lip in thought, \"Mother said I looked to be around fifteen when I was born, so I guess I would be sixteen soon.\" She missed the confused and peculiar face Cornelius gave her. Crinkling his eyebrows, Cornelius tried not to sound like an idiot as he asked, \"Fifte-When you were born? How-What do you mean?\" To his consternation, he failed. \"Oh, did I never tell you?\" Thumbelina set down the flower crown she making in her hand and turned to her fiancé. \"Mother wasn't able to have any children so one day she went to a good witch and was given a barleycorn. I was inside the flower that bloomed from the seed. Apparently I looked about fifteen years old.\" Cornelius was shocked at the news. If his fiance was born from a flower, than that meant- \"But, Thumbelina, did you know that the original fairies were born from flowers?\" Thumbelina's eyes widened slightly. \"I didn't know that. Are you saying that I could have been a fairy all along?\" she asked excitedly. Cornelius inclined his head and walked over to Thumbelina. \"Well, you were able to make the flowers bloom with just your voice. Maybe you were, sweetheart.\" He fingered the new wings on her back. \"It's strange, though. No fairy has been born from a flower in centuries.\"[Chapter 5] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Found Characters: Cornelius/Jacquimo Universe: off-canon Summary: What if Jacquimo had managed to find Cornelius himself? ~0~ Getting slammed into a tree of nothing but jagged wood was not what Jacquimo was expecting on his quest to find the fairy prince. In fact, being on this quest in the first place was not in his plans at all. But, unlike any other swallow who headed south for the winter, he was open to anything and helping out a poor tiny girl find her love was definitely something he felt apt to do. Now if only the fairy prince wasn't so difficult to find. Of course, it wasn't so much the prince himself that was hard to find - who unknowingly to him was on his own quest to find his love - but rather the very widely hidden Vale of the Fairies that was tough to find. Asking the rabbit, the fox, and even the hibernating bear proved fruitless and Jacquimo was hard pressed as to where to look next for the ever elusive prince or his home. Fighting against a particular gust of wind, Jacquimo squinted his eyes at a speck in the sky, which seemed to be fast approachin- Letting out a squawk from shock, Jacquimo and his unwilling assailant rode along the wind's desire until they both stumbled upon a rock face, Jacquimo with his back to the rock and the other against him. Gravity pushed them down to the forest floor. Lifting his hat away from his eyes, Jacquimo looked down only to see that what he thought was one person was actually two beings, one a bumblebee and the other- \"A fairy? Oh, merci .\" Jacquimo gasped. He stood and watched as the little being, so much like Thumbelina yet not, struggled against the helmet obstructing his vision. \" Bonjour ! Are you alright, little one?\" Successfully removing the helmet, the fairy in front of him looked up. He wiped at a patch of mud still on his neck. \"Oh, yes. I'm fine. And you?\" \"I am magnifique !\" He flapped his wings happily, but seeing his companion glance skeptically at left wing, he amended. \"Oh, well, I do have a thorn in my wing.\" With his attention on it, he could feel the sting it brought with it. \"Would you like me to get that for you?\" The fairy asked politely. \"Oh, would you?\" It was out in the next second. He winced. \"Oh, oh, merci . Oh, that is better.\" he moaned and flapped his wings experimentally. And growing excited he turned to the leaving fairy. \"Oh, s'il vous plaǐt , can you tell me how to find the Vale of the Fairies?\" The fairy turned sharply at that. \"Why are you looking for the Vale?\" he asked warily. \"Oh, why, I must help Thumbelina find the fairy prince!\" Jacquimo cried. The fairy stood up straight at that. \"Thumbelina? You know Thumbelina?\" He said shocked before flying right into Jacquimo's face. \"Where is she? Where can I find her?\" he commanded strongly. Seeing his overly emotional reply realization dawned on the swallow. \"Are you the fairy prince?\" \"I am.\" The fairy prince barely interjected. \"Oh! That is truly magnifique !\" Jacquimo cried happily. He began to jump around. \"Come on, fairy prince. Thumbelina is waiting for you! She's been having a very bad day.\" He finished off solemnly. \"What?\" The prince's wings fluttered. \"Please, take me to Thumbelina.\" He demonstrated the urgency by climbing onto an awaiting bumblebee. \"Oh yes! Follow me, mon amie ! We will find your future princess!\" They took off, fighting strongly against the winds the whole way. ~0~ With newfound hope in his chest, Prince Cornelius followed behind the humming swallow. He had fast been losing hope of finding his love before the winter frost came bruising in. It was fate itself that led to Buzzby losing control of his flight. And it was fate again that led to them crashing into the very swallow that was looking for him for Thumbelina. \"La la-la-la-la-la la-la\" hummed the bird. \"There is the pond that looks like a shoe.\" he said giddily. And what a strange bird indeed. \"Oh, aha! That is where I saw Thumbelina last!\" The swallow commented gesturing to a large tree off to the side before swooping over. \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina, I have found him! I have found him! I find your fairy prince!\" he cried out. Studying the area with his eyes, Prince Cornelius steadily grew worried when he saw no sign of his love. It was only because he was so concentrated on finding her that he heard her lovely voice coming from a little further along the trunk of the tree. \"Jacquimo? Jacquimo, where are you?\" \"Thumbelina!\" Cornelius answered instead, not even bothering to direct Buzzby to her location. Taking to the air himself, Cornelius flew as fast as he could to where her voice came from. Spotting a speck of orange against the bark of the tree, Cornelius beamed. \"Cornelius?\" Thumbelina asked, looking around not having spotted him until he was almost upon her. She gasped. \"You. It's you. Cornelius, you're here!\" Her face could barely contain her smile. Wasting no time in flying to her, Cornelius reached for her and lifted her into the air. \"Thumbelina, will you marry me?\" She wrapped her arms around his neck. \"I will,\" she sighed. He kissed her deeply. Jacquimo cheered.[Chapter 6] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Waiting Characters: Cornelius/Thumbelina Universe: Off-Canon Summary: Why should Cornelius have to wait until the morning to see his beloved? ~0~ Thumbelina sighed happily from her place next to the window. It was a vastly different sigh than the one she had given earlier that evening when she despaired over her small size and pondered over the existence of fairies. But not even two hours ago yet, her belief was changed and her prayers answered when a curious and interested fairy prince wandered in through her window as she danced with an imaginary fairy of her own. Oh, how fast a night can change. Sadly, said fairy prince had to leave unexpectedly when his mother - the Queen of the fairies - called upon him urgently. Now, Thumbelina sat upon her nut bed gazing at the picture of the fairy prince and princess marrying each other. She wondered if that would be Prince Cornelius and her one day. She giggled. Falling back into her bed, Thumbelina began dreaming of her new love. But in no time at all, she was being woken up by hands caressing her back. Slowly opening her eyes with a moan, Thumbelina gazed at a blurry picture in front of her. Hearing a soft chuckle that sounded familiar, Thumbelina jumped awake at recognizing the sound. \"Cornelius! You came back?\" It was obvious that nighttime was still present. \"I couldn't stay away, Thumbelina. Morning is too far away.\" Cornelius whispered. He smiled crookedly at her. \"But what about that business with your mother?\" \"Well, you didn't think that would take all night, did you?\" Cornelius asked, grabbing the edge of her comforter and sliding a leg over. \"Scoot over, love,\" he breathed out. Thumbelina blushed but obliged. \"Oh, are you staying the night?\" Cornelius paused. He stared intently at her and smirked slightly. \"Do you want me to stay the night?\" \"Oh, uh, well, you were getting in so I assumed, but, uh, it's okay if you don't!\" Thumbelina rambled flustered. Cornelius chuckled and scooted close, making Thumbelina blush harder. \"What Thumbelina wants, Thumbelina gets,\" he answered simply, snuggling up to her. He was planning on staying anyways. \"Go back to sleep, Thumbelina. I wish to take you to the Vale of the Fairies in the morning.\" ~0~ She'll have to remind herself later to bend her son over her knee for falling for a girl so far away. The only reason she was still after the niña was because of her beautiful voice, otherwise they would be halfway to Medina right now for their show. As it was, they were half a day's travel behind their schedule. Gracias a Dios the Fairy Prince and the niña were singing loud enough to catch the whole glade's attention, or she would've had a hard time finding out where the chica lived. But why did she have to live so high up?! Mrs. Toad grunted and grumbled as she trekked her way up the siding of the house and toward the window the girl and the fairy boy were last seen at. The things she does for show business… She was glad to see the window was not only unlocked but open a tad. Que suerte! Spotting a little nut bed only a foot away, she hopped gladly toward it– cause surely her new money earner would be there – only to shriek at seeing a second body with wings entangled in the sheets. The noise made the occupants of the bed sit up in surprise. \"Oh, what?\" Thumbelina said disoriented. Cornelius was quicker to react. \"Who are you?!\" Seeing a massive masked toad next to Thumbelina's bed, Cornelius abruptly shot to the air with sword in hand. He had no doubts about what the creature was going to do. \" Ay Dios mio !\" Mrs. Toad cried jumping away from the sword, accidently going further into the room and farther from the window. Her eyes shifted across the room, landing on Thumbelina who scurried to hide. Another jab from the prince's sword had her focusing on the more prominent issue. She prepared to leap over the prince and toward the window when the sound of a growl came from behind her. \"Oh. A dog!\" This could not have gotten any worse. With rising panic, Mrs. Toad leapt across the room continuously, miraculously managing to escape both the prince and dog, until she ended up close to the window. Not having seen where Thumbelina hid she decided to try another time – perhaps after their grand tour – and left out the still open window. The dog jumped after her but it accidently closed the window in its own face much to her relief. Cornelius gazed over Hero's head to assert himself that the toad was gone. Coming out of her hiding place, Thumbelina tentatively asked, \"Is she gone?\" Shoving his sword back into its scabbard, he answered, \"She's gone, Thumbelina.\" \"What was she even doing here? What did she want?\" \"I have an idea.\" Cornelius growled through his teeth. He grunted in anger. \"Oh, how could I have been so reckless?! I knew it was a mistake!\" Thumbelina tensed. \"A mistake?\" \"A mistake!\" Cornelius shouted not noticing her tone. \"We should have never gone prancing about the glade!\" Trying to hold back tears, Thumbelina asked meekly, \"You regret meeting me?\" Finally noticing her tone, Cornelius whirled around and seeing Thumbelina's crestfallen face, he flew quickly to her side and hugged. \"Oh no, Thumbelina. I didn't mean that. It's just- I'm the crown prince and there are many people who would just love to take our place. I should've remembered that anybody I get close to might end up being targeted as well.\" He wiped at a stray tear. \"I love you, Thumbelina. I'll never regret meeting you.\" Thumbelina blushed and smiled. \"I love you too,\" she whispered, sniffing. Hero growled happily, wagging his tail. Cornelius smiled back and kissed her forehead. He turned to the window as Thumbelina turned to look at the thrashed room. Cornelius was taking no chances so he flew to latch the window in hopes of having some kind of peaceful night. He flew back to Thumbelina as she whispered despondently, \"Mother is going to freak when she sees this mess.\" Looking at the room, Cornelius silently agreed. \"Well we can worry about that in the morning. For now, you have to get some sleep, mi'lady.\" He gestured to her bed and bowed. Thumbelina giggled. They were quick to fall asleep with the security that no one else was getting into the room that night. Unless they were Thumbelina's mother, who shrieked when she came in the following morning to wake her daughter up. Sitting up with surprise once again, Cornelius stared shocked into the equally shocked gaze of Thumbelina's mother. They had overslept. I so did not want to meet Thumbelina's mother this way![Chapter 7] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Rescue Characters: Cornelius/Thumbelina Universe: off-Canon Summary: After all, there was only one traveling toad show in the vicinity… ~0~ He thought he was being too eager. After all, it had only been last night that Thumbelina promised to meet with his parents, and he to meet her mother. But that was very late last night and here he was, with dawn barely over, already at her window-sill harboring gifts for his beloved – and hopefully – future princess. Now looking at the carnage that was her bedroom, he couldn't have been gladder for his over eagerness. \"Who did it?\" He growled. Hero whimpered in shame but quietly murmured out an answer to the angered fairy prince. \"A toad?\" Cornelius was surprised at the response. He wondered for a split second how a toad could have met Thumbelina, before recalling the events of last night. He cupped his head in regret, now remembering how he was the one to lead them right to her. His regret turned to anger at their audacity to steal his girl. Barely acknowledging Hero's barking with a brief \"good dog\", Cornelius was quick to fly to his bumble. He absentmindedly pulled out his sword, already thinking of the many ways he could skewer his fiancé's kidnapper and turned to Hero. \"I'll find her,\" he promised. Hero scurried to go with him but Cornelius knew that where he was going a dog would not be useful. \"No, no, Hero. Look, you stay here and take care of Thumbelina's mother. Let her know everything will be all right.\" After all, there was only one traveling toad show in the vicinity… ~0~ Thumbelina wanted to stomp around. She really did. She wanted to pound her feet aggressively into the ground, throw her hands into the air, and scream to the heavens her frustrations. Did no one care what she thought?! She didn't want to marry the toad! She didn't even know he existed, until his pushy mother stole her straight out of her home as she slept. She wanted to pull her hair out at her own inability to swim out of this wretched pond to get back to her mother. She had to have found her empty room right now. Thumbelina couldn't exactly tell what time of the day it was, but she knew her mother would've been up by dawn and would've checked in on her only child. Why, oh why, did these toads ever think she would want to marry into the family and go gallivanting around the world? Sure, the idea to travel was appealing and so was the idea of making her mom proud of her talent, but if fame meant living a life under the control of another than she wanted no part in it. Now if she could only figure out how to get off this lily pad than she could- \"…lina!\" What was that? \"Thum…lina!\" Thumbelina looked around frantically. \"Cornelius? Cornelius! Cornelius, I'm here! Help!\" She waved her hands when she spotted an approaching figure. She let out a grunt of surprise when she lost her balance and fell on her bum again. She blushed, embarrassed, but was quick to throw back her hair and get up on her knees. \"Thumbelina! Thumbelina, are you alright?\" Cornelius asked, getting Bumble to land on the unsteady lily pad. Thumbelina's hands shot out to balance herself. \"Where are those awful toads? Did they hurt you?\" He leaned forward to check her himself. Thumbelina waved his hands away. \"No, no. They didn't hurt me. But—but I was stolen away by Mrs. Toad, who says I have to marry her son, and I just—\" \"What!\" Cornelius interrupted. He scowled and grabbed his sword. \"Thumbelina, tell me where they went. I'll show them what I've got.\" He waved his sword around. \"They'll never think to take you away after I'm done with them!\" She blushed and smiled at his protectiveness, but sighed. \"Thank you, Cornelius, but can we just go home now? Mother will be terribly worried.\" Cornelius looked at her sharply, but then seeing her downtrodden appearance, softened, and pulled her up into a hug. \"Oh, Thumbelina, I'm so sorry. I should have been more careful last night.\" He stroked her hair and lay a kiss on her shoulder. Thumbelina tightened their embrace and shook her head. \"You couldn't have known. Besides, you're here now. That's what matters.\" Buzzby buzzed at her. \"And you too, Buzzby! Thank you for getting here so quickly.\" Thumbelina giggled. Cornelius rolled his eyes but smiled. Pulling away from the hug, he hoisted Thumbelina up onto Buzzby. \"Alright then, let's get you home. Hero was crying for you.\" \"Oh no. Oh, poor Hero.\" Thumbelina gasped, bringing her hands up to her mouth as Cornelius hopped up in front of her. After Cornelius grabbed his love's arms and brought them around his chest, they took off, just barely missing the return of the toad family and the padre arriving to wed the human with the oldest son. Grundel let out a cry of anger, as his brothers started laughing at him.[Chapter 8] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Lamentation Characters: Thumbelina's mother, Cornelius/Thumbelina Universe: Post-Canon Summary: She never wanted to feel such despair again. ~0~ She could still remember the day she received the awful news. It had not been unexpected, but it had come quicker than they – well, now she – had anticipated. And it had come without remorse. She knew he wasn't going to make it, especially as his cough only got worse and worse, to the point that blood would begin to speckle his handkerchief, and as she took on more and more of the work when he couldn't lift a leg off the bed in the mornings. Truthfully, she wasn't surprised when the doctor told her he would pass on before the night was over, but it still felt like a cart had run over her heart a thousand times when he did eventually do so. She couldn't bring herself to do the work the following morning. And when the coroner finally came and took her husband away, she could no longer hold back the gut-wrenching sobs that came straight out of her soul. She hadn't even been able to give him a child. The news that she was infertile had been devastating for them both. He had wanted a son to pass on his family legacy. She had just wanted to bring new life into the world. They had even begun preparation of a nursery not long after their marriage. When no child came along even after five years of marriage, they had called upon a doctor only to receive the awful news. It hurt. It hurt a lot. She fell more in love with him when he didn't leave her, when he said that a child doesn't make a marriage nor does it mean his love for her would go away. But it had still been devastating for her, for she could see how great a father he could have been. She thought she would never experience such misery again until the sickness came in. It had been subtle at first, so much so that he had been able to hide it for a few weeks. But she was perceptive, and it wasn't hard to notice that she would frequently awake before him most mornings, when he was usually the type to wake before dawn even crested over the landscape. When she confronted him about it, she didn't let any sadness cloud their days. He had already been to the doctor and a cure was non-existent. She didn't want her last days with her husband to be melancholy. He didn't deserve an end like that. But now, he was gone. She was all alone and she wept for her loss, his loss, the world's loss. He had been such an amazing man. The visit to the good witch had been unplanned, and never had she thought she could experience the joy that was motherhood. Sure, she hadn't given birth to her baby girl, and her baby girl wasn't necessarily a baby, nor even a true human. But she was her child none-the-less and her days grew joyous once again. If only her husband could have experienced this joy before he passed on. She thought she would never experience misery again until the morning she walked into her daughter's room and found it trashed, and her daughter nowhere in sight. She barely had enough time to stagger into a chair before gut-wrenching sobs overtook her body again. She barely felt the nudge on her hand from her old dog. She had lost someone again. She had failed her daughter. But no, she couldn't think like that. Her daughter was gone, yes. But she wasn't gone . No, she had to believe someone would find her. Someone would bring her little girl home. So she prayed. She prayed through the falling of the leaves, through the harsh winter snow, through the beginning of spring. Until finally, her daughter came back to her, happy, healthy, and with a beau in hand. She didn't even notice the wings until after her tears dried and her cheeks hurt from her smile. She thought she had seen a fairy once, but now there was no doubt about it. Her daughter had landed herself a fairy prince and now she was a fairy herself! She could barely wrap her head around it, but she wasn't bothered too much. Her daughter was back at home, safe in her bed. When it became time for her their marriage ceremony, she didn't allow herself to weep. How could she, when her daughter was so happy? She knew her daughter had despaired being the only one her size in the world, and secretly, she was upset over the same thing. The fairy prince peeking in at the window had been a blessing. But now he was taking her daughter away. He was taking her away to start a family of their own. Or so she thought. It turns out her daughter didn't want to be far from her mother either as their dwelling would be just steps away from her farmhouse. Not that she would need to frequent there as her daughter and son-in-law seemed to be content to lounge around in the backyard, where they were currently setting up a race between a most silly bird and a little bumblebee. Three little bugs flew around their heads in excitement too. Their presence wasn't unusual to see in her backyard nowadays. The first time they came, however, she was surprised but pleased that her daughter had made so many friends during her terrible trek through the frozen forest. She smiled at their silly antiques. She owed a lot to the good witch for giving her such a great gift. She would never forget her time with her husband. She would always be sad for his passing, but times were great and she had never been happier.[Chapter 9] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Nothing is Impossible Characters: Thumbelina, Jitterbugs Universe: off-canon Summary: What if the Jitterbugs flew up to see where Thumbelina's house was? Note: One hundred words exactly. ~0~ \"Hey, Thumbelina?\" Lil' Bee sang. \"You said your house was brown and big and tall, right?\" \"Yes! Do you see it?\" Thumbelina called up from her place on the ground. \"Does it have grass on the roof and black smoke coming out of it?\" asked Gnatty. \"Yes!\" \"Is there a large wall of rocks around it?\" \"Yes! Yes! That's my home.\" Thumbelina cried excitedly. \"It's just over this hill here, Thumbelina!\" called out Baby Bug. \"We'll get there in no time!\" Thumbelina sighed in relief. Soon she'd see her mother and Cornelius. She was never leaving the window open again.[Chapter 10] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Clarity Characters: Cornelius/Jitterbugs Universe: off-camera Summary: Cornelius is a little slow on the uptake Note: One hundred words ~0~ \"So, let me get this straight.\" Cornelius said, rubbing a hand against his eyes. \"Thumbelina – my Thumbelina – is getting married to a mole tonight!\" He repeated, being more forceful with the last word. The Jitterbugs nodded in unison. \"Yes.\" \"And everyone in the Vale thinks I'm dead .\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"And there is a toad and a beetle after me and Thumbelina?\" \"Yeah!\" they cried out. \"You've got to help her.\" \"Right.\" Cornelius groaned at his misfortune. \"Do you know where the mole lives?\" \"Uh…\" \"I see.\" Cornelius sighed annoyed, once again wondering how Thumbelina managed to get herself into such situations.[Chapter 11] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Nerves Characters: Cornelius/Colbert Universe: off-camera Summary: Father and Son have a moment to themselves. Note: One hundred words ~0~ \"Cornelius, son, you have got to stop touching it.\" Colbert scolded. \"I'm sorry!\" Cornelius rattled absent mindedly, forcing his hands away from tugging at his clothes. \"Look, I know you're nervous. I still remember when I was getting married to your mother-\" Cornelius cut him off. \"I'm not nervous, Father. I would've married Thumbelina sooner if Mother didn't insist on tradition.\" \"Oh?\" Colbert was slightly amused. \"Well then, I guess my speech was for nothing.\" He watched his son fidget for a few more seconds before some mischievous had him say, \"Excited for the wedding night?\" \"Dad!\" Colbert laughed.[Chapter 12] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Wings Characters: Thumbelina Universe: post-canon Summary: Flying was amazing to a once grounded girl. Note: One hundred words ~0~ She loved flying. She loved it more than she ever thought she could've. She loved the feel of the wind guiding her, the sense of freedom, the ability to go higher than all the trees could. She loved diving, twirling, and tumbling around. She loved the thrill of swerving out of the way of falling leaves, of chasing the Jitterbugs around, of having the sun warm her back. She loved when her skin grew goosebumps as the air thinned and got colder. She loved the sore feeling she got from her wings. She loved Cornelius for giving them to her.[Chapter 13] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Rain Characters: Thumbelina/Cornelius Universe: post-canon Summary: When trapped inside from the rain, it is best to just sit back and relax. ~0~ It was days like today that made the ever-escaping fairy prince want to scream in aggravation. Days where the sun shone down on the landscape, animals made social calls, and the wind sang through the trees made the zealous prince take to the skies to search for adventure and danger. Days like today, however, where the sky turned dark, the sun went to sleep, winds became ferocious, animals hid, and clouds blanketed the land, had the intrepid prince stuck inside seeking refuge from the rain. Days like today usually had him squirming in boredom, restlessness, and agitation. But having a slumbering Thumbelina leaning on his shoulder and feeling her chest rise with her quiet breaths had him uncharacteristically leaning back and relaxing. Maybe days like this weren't so bad after all.[Chapter 14] Adventures with Thumbelina Titles: Children with Names Characters: Thumbelina/Cornelius Universe: off-camera Summary: They were going to have children someday. ~0~ \"Adaliz?\" \"Of the nobility? No way.\" \"Kamille?\" \"Perfection? I don't want her to be conceited.\" \"What about Karcsi?\" \"Joyful song… Sounds nice. Maelynn?\" \"It's cute, but we're not gods. Minnie? It means 'wished-for child'.\" \"It also means bitter. Floriana?\" \"But we already live in flowers. How about Liliane?\" \"Liliane… I love it for a girl. But what if we have a boy?\" \"Leeroy!\" \"Ew. No. Damien?\" \"Untamed? Like his father?\" \"I am not untamed.\" \"Phillipe?\" \"We're not big enough to ride horses.\" \"Ricard?\" \"Strong ruler sounds interesting but it doesn't roll off the tongue.\" \"What about Henry?\" \"No.\" \"Clovis?\" \"Name of a king? I don't think so. Honestly, I liked Liliane and Damien the most.\" \"Hmmm. I did too. I wonder which one we'll use first.\" She rubbed at her stomach. Not missing the action, Cornelius' eyes widened. \"Thumbelina, are you…?\" \"Yes! We're going to be parents!\" She giggled happily.[Chapter 15] Adventures with Thumbelina Title: Suspicions Characters: Cornelius/Thumbelina Universe: in-canon Summary: Cornelius was getting suspicious, and when he got suspicious, he was prone to spying. ~0~ Cornelius was getting suspicious, and when he got suspicious, he was prone to spying. Who was he spying on? His wife. Well, almost wife. Whatever. You see, every morning – as far as he could tell – Thumbelina was grazing the time it would be for breakfast among the family. As everyone was already dressed and contemplating heading to the dining room a little early, she was just getting in, dressed in scruffy clothes – And wet. Or damp. Damp was a better word. And no matter how many times he asked her where she was going off to so early in the morning, she would always blush and respond with \"nowhere in particular\" before heading off to bed at the earliest possible opportunity. Cornelius was going to get to the bottom of this, especially as his parents didn't seem to be overly concerned about her transgressions, which was totally unfair because if he were to be leaving each morning without warning at all he would have the whole squad of royal guards searching for his bu— Ahem. Anyway… So, it was unfair and, thus, Cornelius hatched up a plan to confront his lover hopefully before she left the following morning. (He would have gone this morning but he had overslept. It seems his girl was leaving right at the break of day. He was astounded that someone his age could even open their eyes before the sun even announced its presence let alone actually get out of bed, but he digresses.) So, he made sure to go to bed soon after she did and he made sure to have Buzzby at the ready lest he oversleep again. He even left the curtains of his window open so the sun could wake him up. She wasn't going to escape him again. Unless he subconsciously rolled over and pulled a pillow over his head. Buzzby wasn't any help either, having fallen asleep outside under a leaf. If he hadn't jolted awake not twenty minutes or so later, he would have completely missed Thumbelina's departure for a second time. As it was, he barely caught sight of her long auburn hair disappearing around a corner of a lily. He cursed under his breath and scurried to catch up, moving behind flowers and hiding behind rocks whenever he felt he could be spotted if she were to turn around, which wasn't a lot – or at all – and that puzzled him. Was she confident she wouldn't be found out or did she not care that she could be caught? If the latter was true then why didn't she just tell him where she went? If this wasn't good he was totally going to enter her room and tie her down to the bed and keep her there—Woah. Dirty thoughts. Ok, got to stop. Hey, where did she go? Spotting her flying up and away – she looked so comfortable up there – Cornelius ducked down under the plants and followed her, taking to the air himself. He guessed the coast was clear because she didn't bother to look around anymore – he needed to teach her to be more careful, what if she got kidnapped again? – and he wondered yet again where she was going. Wait. She couldn't possibly be seeing another guy, right? No way! He won't allow it! If she was, was she meeting him at some lake or river somewhere? I thought she hated the water! It's not the toad, is it? Ew. That's a gross thought. No, no possible way it's the toad she's meeting. But who else could it be? He had to get his thoughts together. He almost crashed into a branch back there. Woah. And now he almost crashed into Thumbelina's back. She even turned around and would have spotted him if he wasn't so much more agile than her. Good thing she didn't give it too much thought and kept going. Cornelius tried to keep his thoughts in the back of his mind as he kept following her. He wondered how she managed to get this far out of the Vale and not get lost without him knowing about it. But his parents did seem awfully unconcerned about it. Did they know about this? Why didn't he? And now there goes his thoughts again. Got to reign them in. Wait. Was she stopping? Oh, she was. Got to get to a hiding place. And look, that's the river she's be sneaking out to go to. So, what was she doing? Nothing. She was standing there. Why was she looking behind her? Was she looking for the other boy? I'm gonna cream that twat's nec— \"Cornelius, stop hiding.\" Oh, sh— ","Summary":" Adventures with Thumbelina Title: What if? Characters: Thumbelina/Jacquimo Universe: off-canon Summ"},{"Movie":"Gamera","Title":"Gamera: Invasion of Gyaos","Author":"Admiral Larsen","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2416093","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Gamera: Invasion of Gyaos. Disclaimer: All things related to Gamera are owned by Daiei Studios. \"The US, Chinese, and Russian air forces report large number of Gyaos birds converging on Japan\" –Unknown Japanese general, Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: First line of defense. Skies over Japan: The skies of Japan filled with the sounds of jet engines screaming in at full throttle. From as far the eye could see every Japanese military aircraft that could fly had formed up into formation with the E-767 and E-2 AWACS and aircraft taking up the rear. On the ground and water, military units positioned every anti-aircraft weapon they could get their hands on at every conceivable point. They ranged from machine guns to Patriot missiles. At sea, all four Kongo class destroyers, armed with the advanced Aegis radar defense system, sailed up to positions east of Japan with SM-2 missiles ready to launch. Maritime Defense Command: In the Maritime Defense Command Center, everyone watched the enormous radar screens as swarm of Gyaos closed in on the aerial defense line. They wondered out loud if any of the other nations would assist or they would face this threat alone along with the assistance of the turtle monster known as Gamera. From the radar screen, it seemed that the Gyaos swarm would slam into a wall of steel with Gamera arriving from the south to assist. As they watched the screen, both generals nodded in confirmation of what was to happen next as Otani picked up a phone which linked with Air Defense Command, \"All long range missile batteries are to commence an attack\". He then turned to rejoin everyone as they prepared to watch the unfolding spectacle. Skies of Eastern Japan: From all over Eastern Japan as well as in the ocean, missiles leapt from their batteries and arched upward into the sky before heading straight to their targets. As soon as the first missiles left their tubes, the crews reloaded as soon as possible. The Gyaos swarm continued on its course in a crazed fashion as they didn't expect any resistance. That statement proved very wrong when the lead Gyaos creatures suddenly angled their heads up in shock as they spotted the heat trails of missiles. Though the missiles had proven almost near useless before back in 1995, many flew in the sky and eventually, Gyaos birds stared to drop like flies. Unfortunately, the first salvo ended without dropping many and the rest screamed forward in anger at the blockade. Seeing that the swarm continued its advance, the command center immediately issued its order via the AWACS, \"All aircraft attack, repeat, attack\". Many of the pilots flying tonight were veterans of the previous monster attacks in 1995 and 1996. Having seen the results of monster battles and knowing the fate awaiting Japan, they swore to fight to the last round and to the last gallon of gas if it would help defeat the threat. Once they received the order, the pilots immediately armed all of their air-to-air missiles and accelerated to full burn to deliver in the first few shots before their opponents reacted. Soon, waves of AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles leapt from the railings and headed straight for their targets. The Gyaos creatures already had reformed and continued on their course when suddenly more missiles slammed into their hides. More Gyaos creatures started to fall to the missile salvo and it threw the rest into chaos. That brought as precious amount of time as the fighters dove in among the swarm, firing their machine guns. The Gyaos creatures did not take long to respond and soon thin yellow beams cut across the skies in large numbers, eventually cutting into some of the fighter squadrons. Soon, it turned into a vicious melee with the Gyaos outnumbering and outmaneuvering the F-15s, F-2s, and F-1 fighters. Very quickly, the battle turned against the JASDF squadrons and soon they were busy using every trick in the book to fight their way out. Once a fighter ran out of missiles, it resorted to using 20mm machine guns, which even though it didn't have the kicking power of the missiles, did sting the Gyaos creatures, especially the eyes. The yellow beams of the Gyaos caused many of the fatalities but the creatures also rammed them out of the sky or used their claws and heads to snipe them out of the air. Many felt that they would not make it out without assistance and that there was none left but that changed in the next few minutes when a fireball suddenly cut through the swarm of Gyaos creatures. Everyone turned to see a huge turtle-like shape diving into the battle at full speed while continuing to fire fireballs from its mouth at the bat-like creatures. Once it came into view, the human pilots immediately scattered since they clearly wanted to be out of Gamera's way as he continued to trade long range shots with the Gyaos. Maritime Self Defense Command: On the command net, the Maritime Defense Command heard the sound of the battle and it sent chills down their spines. As soon as the word came in about Gamera arriving, everyone winced at the thought in a mixture of irony and hope. Irony that the monster they attempted to destroy yesterday now turned out to be their best chance for survival and hope that Gamera's assistance would really make the difference for their country's survival. Air Battle: The Gyaos screamed in anger as their eternal nemesis pelted them with orange balls of flame. As one, they turned towards Gamera with some closing in to peck him while others started firing the yellow sonic beam again. Though Gamera fought instinctively hard, the wound suffered at the hands of Iris slowed him down. The turtle monster continued to fire rapid shots of his fireballs at his opponents to partially kill and force his assailants to back off. Unfortunately he was one with the Gyaos outnumbering him, which they soon took advantage of to swarm him. Despite the combined defense, the battle started to edge towards the Japanese mainland and soon the people on the ground noticed the battle going on right above them. When the debris started to rain down upon them, they started to panic, delaying the movement of troops to the battle zone and presenting and inviting target for any Gyaos that broke through the blockade. Back in Maritime Defense Command, the sounds of battle made everyone wince and the sight of planes disappearing off the scopes sent shivers down their spines. After looking at the map for several more minutes, Takagi stood up and yelled out, \"Order all air units to regroup and allow all air defense batteries to fire with everything they have once our air units clear out of the way\". One of the radar officers immediately asked, \"What about Gamera\"? Takagi bristled but understood and replied, \"We'll just have to hope that our gunners are good aimers or that the monster himself will clear out of the way once we launch\". He sat back down as the orders made their way to the air-defense units. In the air, the Japanese fighter pilots and Gamera both battle savagely against the odds and more Gyaos continued to die but Japanese pilots also fell and Gamera suffered more injuries. When they received word, several wanted to stay but the flight leaders could clearly see the odds against them so they immediately broke contact and regrouped over the Home Islands. As the Gyaos continued to fire their beam weapons, Gamera flew in with his shell facing right back at the birds, the hard material of the shell deflecting the yellow beam right at the bird creatures, cutting many of them into pieces. Before the swarm reformed, the turtle monster fired several more fireballs before heading away at full power. Everyone in the command center was counting down the seconds the fighters needed to clear out. It was a nerve wracking wait and everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the word came down and the commanders showed it by transmitting the orders \"All batteries are to commence firing\". Another wave of SAMs (surface to air missiles) of all types emerged from their launch tubes and headed straight for Gyaos. They soon exploded amongst the creatures, killing many more and scattering them in confusion. Smelling prey all around, the swarm scattered with some heading down towards the water while the rest headed straight for the main islands. The Aegis radars on the destroyers picked up and despite the overwhelming numbers, the crews on the ships rushed to their battle stations and started firing everything they had left. Soon the sky lit up with more explosions but only a few more Gyaos fell before the rest swarmed over the ships. Two of the four destroyers fell to accurate yellow shots that cut the destroyer hulls in half instantly. The other two suffered a more brutal fate as the birds slammed their steel plated heads against the ships and picking off sailors with their legs and jaws. The rest flew on towards mainland Japan, their combined screeches and screams sending many shivers down the spines of everyone who could hear it. Ruins of Kyoto: After finding a way out of the ruins of Kyoto Station, Mayumi Nagamine and Asagi Kusanagi managed to get Ayana Hirakasa and her companion to one of the hastily set up aid stations, which were already handling the many wounded. As Nagamine talked with one of the officers, she turned to see Asagi talking with Ayana and consoling her as Ayana seemed on the verge of tears after view the rows of injured and the dead. Nagamine could only wonder to herself what the young Japanese girl would endure in the future and hoped that she would be alright. Though she did note the increased activity with the troops in the last few minutes, she had no idea what was going on until Asagi suddenly walked slowly out of the tent and back outside. She immediately ran to the younger Japanese woman's side and upon noticing Asagi's pained face, she asked, \"Has it begun Asagi\"? The young woman nodded with a little fear at the question, \"The battle has already begun and already it has turned against us\". She paused before answering the scientist's silent question, \"All we can do is hope for the best\". The young woman prayed silently towards the kaiju that she once shared a mental bond with and prayed for the kiaju's safety. Author's notes:[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Firefights over Japan. Maritime Command: The room erupted into a scene of pandemonium and panic as the radar screens clearly showed the Gyaos swarm still heading towards Japan. The combined strength of their forces and the monster Gamera was not enough to inflict any severe damage and now both were scattering to hidden places to regroup. Technicians and other soldiers rushed to remove any needed equipment while several others continued to monitor the battle and relay information to the commanders in the room. Meanwhile, the commanders watched icily as the many red dots continued to move ever closer to the Eastern Japanese coast. Both Generals Otani and Takagi watched the scene before them with grave apprehension. They had thrown in their best and even with the assistance of Gamera, the Gyaos creatures were undeterred in their advance and soon would be over Japanese airspace. While the air units were eager to re-engage the swarm, they would need help and fast. Already, the American air units in Japan and on Okinawa had radioed in their desire to help and despite the anger both generals felt at the lack of inaction by their fellow neighbors, they immediately acquiesced to the request with the support of the Prime Minister Nagahara. Suddenly, an aide ran up to them and said to them, \"Sir, the rest of the personnel have been already evacuated to the emergency shelters, the car is waiting to transport you to the shelter where the joint chiefs and the cabinet are\". With the fact that they couldn't do anything else and the fact that the Maritime Command Center was in an exposed position, the commanders wisely followed the aide out to the waiting convoy and they soon sped off to the rendezvous point. They soon arrived at the shelter where to their surprise, along with the Japanese Prime Minister, his cabinet, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were ambassadors and military officers from the surrounding areas conversing with the officers already in the room. After everyone exchanged greetings and introductions, the commanders immediately got down to work while observing a large digital map of the battlefield. It continued to show the red circle advancing towards the coast with the blue dots jockeying for position. Unfortunately, the blue dots would be late and already several of them had disappeared as the enormous red circle approached. The American commander in the area, Air Force General Ferguson replied to his Japanese hosts, \"Right now our air units in Japan are on full alert and two of our carriers are in the position with the third arriving in a few hours\". He paused before continuing apologetically to his hosts, \"Unfortunately that is all you guys can expect since our forces have suffered some heavy losses due to the fact that we had Gyaos attacks ourselves\". Both Japanese air commanders turned back towards the screen and watched the continuing progress of the battle before Takagi said it for all of them, \"It's a gigantic mess out there and it's going to keep getting worse\". Skies of Japan: The skies of Japan this night were full of stars and portrayed an immense sense of beauty to all who saw them. Unfortunately this night, the sky started to darken as a living dark cloud soon approached from the east. The sight of enormous numbers of the Gyaos creatures as well as the combined noise the bird monsters generated sent civilians scattering for cover before the monsters decided to feed on them. Unfortunately, the Gyaos were very hungry and soon several of the birds broke formation and swooped down towards the ground, their legs extended and their wings creating huge wind shears wherever they flew. They soon grabbed scores of frightened civilians and started to feast on them. The rest continued their advance and soon spread out throughout the entire country. However the aerial forces of the world, though badly mauled, were still eager for action. Already the Type 93 antiaircraft weapons were still spitting fire at any Gyaos creature that came their way, supported by wave of mobile Type 93 (SAM-3) batteries. With scores of ammunition impacting all around their skin, including their unprotected areas, the bird soon started to fall in numbers. Unfortunately, the anti-aircraft gun crews had to fire short and change position or risk becoming a target of an angry Gyaos. Soon scores of the birds started to land on streets of the cities of Japan, their screeches and wind shears shattering windows. With the fact that they were now on the ground, the ground units sprung into action with battle groups of Type 90 tanks and infantry carriers roaring to engage. The Gyaos on the ground crackled in rage before they started firing their yellow beams rapidly. The beams sliced cleanly through the hulls of the vehicles, detonating their ammunition and killing scores of soldiers. As the survivors scattered, some took to the air and dove down upon their victims in a style reminiscent of the German Stuka bombers during World War II. Others started to march across the landscape while randomly firing their yellow beams in all directions. Despite their bravery, the JGSDF units were getting overwhelmed and a good portion stood their ground until the Gyaos virtually annihilated them with claw and energy fire. The civilians still in the streets were killed by the score as the Gyaos feasted on them buffet style. Still the military forces stood their ground and soon they would have help from the outside and from the air as scores of fighters from other nations soon started to arrive to help with Russian coming in to the north from Siberia, Chinese air units flying in from the northern parts of the country while the American forces relied on their carriers in the area as well as their air bases on Okinawa to assist in the defense. Gamera, although injured himself, was busy battling scores of Gyaos creatures over central Japan. Through deft flying that would have impressed even the most experienced aviator, the monster continuously kept its shell towards the direction of any beam blast while firing his fireballs regularly at any target of opportunity. The large turtle monster also closed in and swiped at the birds with his left arm while the right one was still healing. But the Gyaos continued to attack savagely against their eternal rival, determined to annihilate him for good. They inflicted more scratches on the turtle monster and forced him to maneuver to avoid the constant yellow beams. In desperation, Gamera started to suddenly fly faster directly against his foes, stretching his left arm out to latch onto the one of the birds. He managed to grab one in the neck and soon both grappled with each other as the other creatures rushed to assist. After having avoided several point blank shots, Gamera threw his prey into the path of several others before incinerating them with a huge fireball blast. The monster then dove away from the fight with several Gyaos behind him towards the Pacific Ocean. Once he reached the Pacific Ocean, he dove down into the water so fast that the birds would not catch him. After circling around for 15 minutes, they flew back to join their brethren in the ghastly feast. The Next Day: Due to its location near the main time zones, Japan is often nicknamed the \"Land of the Rising Sun\" and with good reason for to see the sun rise from areas such as Mount Fuji is a majestic sight indeed. Unfortunately, after an unforgettable night of horror, the sun's rays illuminated a bleak and horrid landscape no country in the world had ever witness. For in some of the grandest cities of the island nation laid scores of black bird-like creatures, their mouths dripping with the remains of their human victims. The birds remained perched on top of the ruined buildings while observing the horizon for anymore sign of prey for even with the slaughter of last night, they still desired more. Also, some had large eggs beneath them, which contained many more of the ghastly beasts. Only by hiding inside their homes and such or in large underground shelters was the population able to escape the prying eyes of their tormentors. Some tried to sneak out but patrolling Gyaos picked them off with brutal and relentless ease. As for the military forces, they were busy licking their many wounds and trying to find any way to hit back. After witnessing the horrors of last night, many people wondered if the world had been plunged to darkness and whether there was any hope of seeing the light once again. A few believed so but after witnessing the battle, they started to have second thoughts and a few wondered if it was time to write their last will and testament. Note: I'm going to stop for now since for this particular one, I'm getting a case of writer's block and some information my other Japanese movie monster fanfic (Godzilla: Operation Final Strike) has come in, allowing me to resume it.[Chapter 4] Personal note: Sorry for taking a long while but my other stories as well as other matters required my attention. Now onto the resumption of the Gamera fanfic. Chapter 4: Regroup and deliberations.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Extraction Outer Space above Japan: As the satellites orbited over Japan, their cameras started to take numerous pictures of the island nation. After that, they transmitted the information to stations all over the globe where the people there processed the information before transmitting it to Tokyo. Once the Prime Minister and the generals received the information, their faces paled at the images of the map. All four islands contained enormous black patches, which symbolized a gathering of Gyaos creatures. Surrounding the islands via maintaining a distance of several hundred kilometers or more were scores of warships from all nations in the Pacific. Interspersed among the blockade were civilian ships attempting to escape from Japan with as many refuges they could save. After looking at the images, Prime Minister Nagahara turned to the generals and asked, \"Can they find the number of Gyaos for each of the islands\"? Otani replied, \"The only way would be to send scout units into the areas and the Gyaos creatures are alert for such threats\". He then said, \"Even if we can ascertain such information, it could change every day if they find more victims on each of the main islands\". The Prime Minister took a deep breath before stating, \"We have to get as much information about the concentrations of these beasts before we move against them\". He then turned to ask, \"Any word about the remains of other Gyaos creatures\"? Takagi replied, \"I would advise you not to get much hope since these creatures have key differences in genetic structure that separate them from the original Gyaos creatures from 1995\". He paused before stating, \"We'd need to gain samples from these particular birds\", \"The attempt to gain access to those samples has yielded unsuccessful results thus far for we can't get to the dead carcass and those that are destroyed by Gamera have their remains scattered into the wind\". That brought more gloom to the room and Nagahara then said to all of the commanders, \"I want you all to work as long as possible to figure out how to defeat this crisis\". He then said, \"The fate of the world is on the line and we must take the lead here since we have the most experience\". He left the somber room to head back to his quarters. As they all considered their options, General Takagi said out loud, \"First we have to gain a full picture of forces at home before we can proceed any further\". He paused before stating, \"After that, we have to figure out how these creatures function and figure out their weaknesses before we go on the offensive\". Everyone in the room nodded for after the Gyaos creatures entered Japanese airspace, the commanders lost contact with all of the bases on the main islands and ran into difficulties in finding out the extent of the heavy losses. The main headquarters attempted to restore communications with its main bases but only managed to raise a few of them due to the breakdown in communications and the Gyaos overrunning several bases almost immediately. Takagi then turned to the American general named Ferguson and then asked, \"When can we expect aerial reinforcements from your end\"? The American gulped before stating, \"Right now we're still positioning all of our assets but if you want to commit our units to joint operations with yours then I think they're capable of commencing operations\". He paused before asking, \"You're thinking about an operation\". Takagi nodded before turning to the other international generals and asked the same questions. He got varying answers with some being very unsure of their commitments to the new campaign, which worried him since he knew the Japanese military could not afford losses like they had and needed help fast. Taking a deep breath, Takagi turned to a large map highlighting the positions of the military forces as well as the Gyaos creatures with black patches on all four main islands. The only thing missing was a location for Gamera, who was last seen spiraling downward into the sea near the Bonin Islands. \"Alright, I want all squadrons to launch on CAP (combat air patrol) around these areas and I want them armed with as much weapons as possible\". He paused before continuing, \"After that, send helicopters to these coordinates\". The Japanese general paused before stating, \"Get as much rest as you can for within a few days, it will be hell for us all\". As the general walked out of the room, he suddenly spotted Minister Okino waiting down the hall while talking with several other politicians. He immediately ran up to the minister and immediately took him aside for a moment before asking him, \"You said that you sent your contacts to Kyoto right\". Okino nodded and said, \"They're in the vicinity of Kyoto train station\". Takagi nodded before saying, \"Get on the line with them and warn them to prepare for evacuation\". Okino ran off and then while Takagi considered several other ugly thoughts before he headed to his makeshift quarters to clear his head. At airfields and on the ships near the vicinity of Japan: All over the periphery of the Northern Pacific, the airbases swarmed with activity. Crews rushed to ready fighters while base commanders briefed their pilots on the nature of the enemy. Many winced and a good portion complained about having to bail out the Japanese as well as their odds of surviving. While the airfields were busy, other installations readied missile defenses for fear of any stray Gyaos flying randomly about. The activity was pretty much the same, if not more busy for the ships in the sea around Japan. Steaming around in groups with weapons aimed at the sky, they waited for word of a new offensive or if anymore Gyaos headed their way. Meanwhile, the three US carriers on station steamed between Kyushu and Okinawa while their crews readied the fighter compliments to join in any future offensive. Only the submarines could get close for they remained underwater almost indefinitely, thereby shielding them from the Gyaos, as they sailed through the waterways of Japan while relying on periscopes to observe the activities of the enormous birds. Knowing that torpedoes were useless, the subs reloaded with a full complement of cruise missiles in the torpedo tubes on the off chance that they could snag one of those beasts. Near the wrecked train station in Kyoto, a few days later: Among the many cities hit was the already devastated city of Kyoto. Some creatures flew overhead while others sat on the ground with their eyes closed. It seemed no one remained alive in the city and anything attempting to move through the rubble would immediately attract the Gyaos and at least one of the birds would pick off the target. In one of the enormous underground shelters, both Nagamine and Kusanagi sat with many others as they waited for news from the outside. To many, it felt like a prison for the shelters were desperately crowded with only limited supplies and ineffective means to communicate with the outside. Along with the civilians were stragglers of the JGSDF that managed to escape into the shelters before the Gyaos arrived. They became the victims of endless questions by frightened civilians and it took much to restrain both sides. The stragglers attempted to reestablish contact with their parent formations but communications became all but impossible. Nagamine and Kusanagi sat together silently observing as Ayana and her friend talked to each other about Ayana's dark experience and the consequences. Though it seemed Ayana had recovered, she still shuddered as she recounted her experiences. Nagamine was surprised by her statements that she turned to an equally surprised Kusanagi and asked, \"Does this feel similar to when you were connected to Gamera\"? Kusanagi shook her head before saying, \"I don't know exactly the differences but I could sense that the connection between Ayana and the creature is very different from my connection with Gamera\". She paused before stating, \"It seems that the influence of the monster focused on unleashing darkness within her via her own fears and guilt\". The young girl and former psychic finished by saying, \"It will take a very long time for her to recover from the experience\". Nagamine's face turned sour at her friend's remarks. Just then, a soldier ran up to the two women and saluted before whispering, \"Dr. Nagamine, we've just received word for you to prepare for extraction from Kyoto to Tokyo\". Nagamine's eyes widened at the thought and she immediately asked, \"Can you get contact with the messengers then\"? The soldier nodded and led both Kusunagi and Nagamine to the small center where the communications gear was set up. Nagamine immediately made her way to one of the phones and dialed the number to the command center. Within a few minutes she managed to reach Okino, \"What is going on here\"? On the other end of the line, the minister replied in a calm voice, \"We need your assistance as soon as possible and it won't do with you and your associates trapped in Kyoto\". He paused as she explained the risks before delivering his own reply, \"The generals have looked at every aspect and feel that this will succeed\". Before Nagamine could reply, Okino said in a cold voice over the line, \"This is a direct order doctor so I suggest getting yourselves ready for the evacuation\". Nagamine gritted her teeth before saying, \"Fine, then along with me and the girl, can you extract two other people as well\". There was silence on the other end of the line before the voice on the other end of the line nodded in agreement. With that, the scientist turned to the former psychic and said, \"You better get to Ayna and her friend and warn them that we're evacuating\". The girl nodded and headed off while the scientist thought about the insanity of the next few hours. Deep Pacific Ocean near Bonin Islands: Within the depths of the Pacific Ocean, the turtle monster's strength finally began to recover with his chest moving at a faster rate and bubbles leaking out of his mouth in a large form, Gamera almost completed healing himself from his wounds. The monster roared in pain as his cells completed their regeneration and formed a new right arm. As the pain started to fade from his regenerated arm, Gamera rose from the ocean floor and let out a roar before setting course and heading towards Japan, intent on resuming battle against his arch nemesis of many millennia. Underground Command Center, Tokyo: Despite having slept for many hours, the occupants in the room still felt bone tired as they observed the maps and the symbols of aircraft and ships moving into position. All knew that it would be a very big gamble and with the deadlock in the United Nations still continuing, to launch an attack on this scale would eat up the last of their resources for the moment. The plan would be for the ships to engage first with missiles to scatter the Gyaos creatures. Once that happened, the fighter and helicopter squadrons would emerge from their bases and conduct a reconnaissance in force of all four islands. Also the helicopters would extract key people from the battle zone and fly them back to Tokyo for consultations on the Gyaos. Takagi observed the movements of the air units with worry for he knew that the only chance was to move exceptionally fast so as to limit losses. That meant timing everything right and he knew that to coordinate an enormous aerial fleet in chaotic conditions would be enormously difficult. He turned to JMSDF Rear Admiral Minechi Koga and asked, \"Are all of your remaining ships in position\". The haggard admiral nodded and said, \"We have locks for our missiles on the largest concentrations of the Gyaos creatures and are waiting for you're command\". He then snarled quietly to his air force counterpart, \"Just make sure to provide fighter cover for the ships after they launch their weapons\". Takagi nodded in agreement and looked at the other generals before turning back to the screen as the next round of fighting got underway, \"Here we go again\". In the Seas around Japan: During the past few days and despite the deadlock in the UN, ships from the different navies of the world began to take up station with their targets already locked in. When the ships received word to launch the attack, the officers looked at each other in alarm and their faces said the same thing, \"Are they insane\"? Despite that, the gathering fleet immediately sounded battle stations and with fighters providing some form of cover overhead, the warships launched their first wave of missiles. In the Inland Sea and the Tusguru Strait, numerous periscopes peered out from the calm dark waters and they scanned the costs in front of them before enormous plumes of smoke rose from the water. As soon as the last wave of missiles rose from the Pacific, the submarines immediately dove deep and maneuvered out of \"dodge\" as soon as possible for they did not want to test the theory of the water providing a sense of stealth against the bird monsters. Many of the Gyaos creatures rested on the ground with their eyes closed. When they sensed the arrival of trouble, their eyes all opened at the same time and they attempted to take to the air. However, the missiles fired from the submarines arrived first with some impacting on the Gyaos directly and others splitting apart into little bomb lets which exploded all around the Gyaos swarm. Yellow energy beams soon flew across the sky as individual Gyaos fired on the numerous missiles, and in the process killing several of their own. Before they decided to turn on each other, their ears picked up the familiar noise of jet aircraft heading their way. As one, they took off into the sky in preparation for more food to feast upon. Already airborne, the pilots looked out into the dark sky with worried faces as they observed for any giant black birds. They soon spotted a wave of Gyaos creatures on radar and the squadron leaders immediately yelled out, \"All pilots, weapons free and engage\". The assembled air groups broke into smaller sections with some engaging from high altitude while others dove for the deck, all at maximum speed. Soon explosions lit up the sky as the numerous fighters tangled with creatures from another time in Earth's far distant past. Within seconds, the battle turned immediately in favor of the Gyaos creatures and the single-seat fighters barely stood their ground against their more numerous, maneuverable and larger opponents. Although a good portion of the Gyaos took to the sky, enough remained on the ground that the next wave of missiles would not miss once they reached their targets. Once the munitions detonated in the midst of a sea of black, it shredded more birds by impacting on their softer areas. Now roused by the sudden explosions, huge swarms of Gyaos took to the air, their mouths screeching non stop and wings flapping rapidly as they searched for prey. They soon joined up with their fellow creatures and soon it turned into an all out aerial brawl with missiles, bullets and yellow energy weapons exploding in the sky. And the horror had only just begun for more combatants waited over the horizon to join in with even more deadly firepower. With satellites and AWACS aircraft operating as close as they could to the battle zone as forward guides, the awaiting heavy bombers unleashed their loads. The ground shook as missiles and bombs exploded all around the landscape, taking out even more Gyaos here and there but the numbers seemed endless and the large bombers immediately gunned their engines to full power in the hope of avoiding the attention of the rampaging birds. As soon as most of the Gyaos took to the air, troops on the ground began to move their anti-aircraft weapons out into the open and in the face of the overwhelming number of targets in the sky and despite the fact that they would most certainly die, the gunners opened up in support with bullets and missiles. A helicopter squadron from Tokyo: If the fighter pilots felt very frightened about taking on the Gyaos, the helicopter pilots were scared absolutely shitless about flying in such a hostile airspace. They were flying at very high speeds and low to the ground in the hope that they would blend in as they flew towards their assigned designations. As a squadron of UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters headed towards Kyoto, their pilots looked all around the sky while keeping their ears glued to their headsets for any future updates. When they started to approach the devastated city, the helicopters descended even lower to avoid the battle above them. Everywhere they looked, they saw devastation that surpassed the scale what they all saw before during the past few years of war against the monsters. It seemed that nothing was alive down there and several pilots already tightened their hands on the controls in preparation to flee. However all thoughts fled as the lead helicopter spotted their destination and they soon began to descend with many praying to their ancestors to protect them. High above them, a ferocious air battle raged as the international fighter squadrons fought to stay alive against their foes, relying on every trick they knew. Sometimes, they would lead their opponents on chases and lured them into the line of fire of their comrades. Such tricks managed to help them barely hold on against a seemingly relentless enemy. The random firing of the Gyaos also partially assisted them for when roused and in close quarters, the birds would sometimes kill each other with their long range weapons. The fighter pilots hoped that the helicopters would finish up with their extraction as quickly as possible for the Gyaos were cutting their ranks down at a voracious rate. Once the Blackhawks landed, their troops streamed out and took up defensive positions as they made their way to the shelter where their \"VIP\" waited. Inside the shelter itself, Nagamine, Kusunagi and their two companions waited at the door pensively as the soldiers in the room attempted to keep the gathering crowd back. When the noises of the battle and that of the helicopters started to filter through, the occupants became agitated as the hope for escape began to rise. As soon as the guards heard a knock on the door, one of them immediately motioned to the evacuees and they soon made their way to the exit while the guards kept everyone back. After leaving the bunkers, the soldiers directed the small group to the awaiting helicopters while making sure no one else made a run for the choppers from the shelters or from the rubble. Once all four took their seats inside, the troops fell back and immediately jump in before the last of the Blackhawks took off for Tokyo. Several civilians did manage to grapple onto the rails of the helicopters and the soldiers reluctantly struggled to pry them off. As they ascended for the long dangerous journey towards Tokyo, both Nagmine and Kusanagi felt guilty for the people still left in the devastated cities and small teardrops began to fall from Kusanagi's eyes as she absorbed all of the horror witnessed thus far. Soon several stragglers of F-15Js assumed positions of flying fighter cover. Unfortunately, several Gyaos spotted the flight and headed towards it at full speed. Immediately, the fighters peeled off and the helicopters accelerated to gain distance from the rampaging birds but it was useless as the Gyaos outflanked the fighter screen and began to bear down on their prey. Kusanagi closed her eyes and prepared for death when she suddenly sensed a nearby presence. Opening her eyes, the young woman spotted a large fireball impacting on the Gyaos with the bird screeching in surprise. After two more fireball blasts, the Gyaos exploded in midair and a large turtle shape flew right by them before heading off to deal with other nearby enemies. The other combatants turned in surprise before the Gyaos turned around as one and headed towards their arch-nemesis while blazing away with their yellow beams. As for the fighters, they scattered as while emptying the last of their ammunition on their now distracted foes before retreating along with the helicopter squadron. Knowing that he was outnumbered, Gamera flew towards his foes at a savagely fast pace with the rocket flames emanating from his legs at red hot while spitting fireballs in rapid succession. Whenever he managed to fly right next to one of the Gyaos, the turtle monster thrust his arms and sliced his foe with his claws. The Gyaos creatures on their part ganged up on Gamera with yellow energy fire and slices from their own claws, forcing the turtle monster to keep his distance and eventually retreat back towards the sea with the black birds in hot pursuit. As she saw the turtle monster in which she once had a psychic connection with retreat once again for the sea, Kusanagi watched Gamera fly away with the Gyaos in hot pursuit and she whispered a small prayer. Nagamine put one of her hands on the younger girl's shoulder in support as the sky flew right by them, \"The monster has fought through ugly battles before\". Kusanagi nodded in agreement at that statement. Underground Command Center, Tokyo: The occupants of the room watched with trepidation as the battle played out on the map. Although several clusters of Gyaos disappeared from the map, a larger number of fighters disappeared from the map with many died fighting their way back to their bases while others attempted to block and stray targets from heading to the sea. Meanwhile, the naval blockade ring continued to fire intermittent waves of missiles towards designated targets. The appearance of Gamera in the battle zone surprised the generals and politicians but they welcomed it for the turtle monster's appearance pulled the Gyaos away from their forces and gave them a chance to escape. As the swarm pursuing Gamera started to increase in numbers, they started to empty to a partial extent out of the main islands. This gave the military forces time to complete their missions and get clear of their pursuers although the remaining Gyaos hammered away them as they fled back to their bases. One of the aides ran up to the commanders with a message in hand and whispered, \"Sir, we've just received word that the helicopters have extracted the cargo and are heading back here now\". All turned back to the map to see the helicopter heading towards Tokyo with battles occurring all around it for a few moments before Otani yelled out, \"Pull some fighters away to protect the helicopter squadrons and signal all others to fall back to base\". The room rushed into action while both Takgai and Otani continued to observe the map for a few more minutes before Otani replied, \"Either way we look at this, we've already lost a lot of units\". Takagi nodded before stating, \"And also we may have also killed more of our own countrymen for debatable reasons\". Both men knew that he was referring to the use of heavy bombers in the attack for though they did inflict damage on the Gyaos, they also inflicted collateral damage on a nation already suffering horrific damage at the hands of the monsters. Takagi paused before stating, \"Ensure that everyone get out of there safely\". Otani nodded and headed off to conduct the defense while Takagi continued to observe the action with worry as dots representing military forces continued to disappear from the screen at a rapid rate. Skies over Japan: The air fleets of the world were embroiled in a life or death struggle against murderous odds. For every Gyaos shot down, its brethren killed a good number of aircraft in retaliation. Also, the high intensity air combat exhausted the ammunition of aircraft within minutes, leaving them vulnerable to the birds swarming all around them. Caught up in staying alive against the Gyaos, the pilots barely received the word to fall back and some could not flee for the swarm of bat-like bird monsters had them virtually encircled and they had no choice to stand, fight and die. The rest immediately gunned their engines to maximum power and headed away from the slaughter. Aircraft from Japan soon joined in the retreat for they knew that they could not return back to their bases without their foes picking them off as well as their home bases. At the same time, the missile launchers shut down and the crews disassembled them while those manning machine guns provided covering fire. After that, the anti-aircraft units scurried about back to their hidden bases but some weren't fast enough as the Gyaos swooped down like dive bombers and picked them off. Pacific Ocean, south of Shikoku: The ancient turtle monster Gamera waged his own dogfight against his numerically larger foes. Flying at maximum speed, Gamera continued fired shots of his fireballs against the bunched up swarm, killing several with each blast. In return, his numerous nemesis blanketed the area with yellow energy fire. As the battle moved farther out to sea, Gamera started to descend down into the ocean when he saw the increasing number of Gyaos heading straight for him. Realizing what was about to happen, several Gyaos drove down to fly to block Gamera's path to the sea while blazing away with their yellow beams. Although suffering immense pain from the constant yellow blasts, Gamera continued to descend and he barely managed to reach the safety of the ocean before the Gyaos inflicted any more damage. Several of the Gyaos dove into the water in pursuit and paid for that when Gamera pounced on them and sliced them up with his claws. Overhead, the Gyaos that flew after Gamera circled around the area where he crashed into the water for a few moments before heading back to mainland Japan. Beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean, Gamera floated down to the bottom of the ocean as he healed his wounds from the recent battle. His eyes closed as the wounds and his spirit started to heal from the constant battle he endured against the creature his creators designed him to exterminate many millennia ago. Author's Notes:[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Research and overhaul Underground command Center, Tokyo As she observed the tissue samples of the Gyaos creatures through a very powerful scanner, Nagamine wiped some sweat off her brow before peering back at the samples. After looking for any loose ends, she then turned to one of her assistants and said, \"You can try it now\". The aide nodded and soon several disturbances enveloped the black samples. Nagamine watched this for several minutes before motioning to the aide to turn it off while she prepared to take a very close look at the results of her experiment. Although some of the samples showed signs of damage, it was to varying degrees while the rest showed no damage at all. Nagamine winced at the implications before turning to her assistants, \"Let's all take a break so to clear our heads\". The other equally worried scientists nodded and they all left the room, leaving Nagamine alone to ponder about any countermeasures that she hadn't thought of herself. It took her a while to notice the presence of Asagi Kusanagi in the room, \"So you couldn't sleep as well\"? The younger woman nodded before saying, \"With all that has been going on, it felt useless to sleep\". She paused before saying sheepishly, \"Besides, I thought perhaps you could use some help\". Nagamine nodded and Kusanagi walked over to look at the samples for a moment before saying, \"So you haven't had any luck in finding a way for us to deal with the Gyaos\". Nagamine shook her head before saying, \"Whatever the civilization did when they created the Gyaos ensured that it came out as a powerful creature even by their standards\". She paused before continuing on, \"I've tried different countermeasures on the Gyaos cell samples but the results were all dismal\". Nagamine's eyes darkened as she said silently, \"I'm afraid to admit that we would have to resort to extreme measures to defeat the Gyaos\". Her tone of voice revealed her exact thoughts of the disgusting option. Switching to a different subject, Nagamine asked the young woman, \"So how have our guests been taking all of this\"? Kusanagi took a deep breath before replying, \"They're holding up but Ayana seems the closest to breaking under the strain\". She paused before continuing, \"Both have been asking about whether their relatives are still alive\". Her eyes told Nagamine the answer before she replied back, \"Looks like you could use a little rest, how about we get some food\". The scientist laughed before they left the room and down to the temporary mess hall. In his temporary quarters, Prime Minister Matsumoto sat with Minister Saito, the Foreign Minister, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The chiefs of staff had already given their briefing and now the Foreign Minister began to speak, \"From what we've been able to hear from New York, we've been encountering difficulties in trying to ensure the support from the rest of the world\". The Foreign Minister turned to the Join Chiefs of Staff and said, \"From what the commanders have said, the other nations in the region, especially the Americans have supported us but they've all been somewhat holding back\". He then switched to asking Minister Saito, \"Any progress on Nagamine's studies on the monsters\"? The somewhat disheveled minister shook his head and said, \"Right now she and the other scientists have had few successes in trying to discover any weaknesses\". He paused before continuing, \"If you use those reports right now, it could drive away all of the support or persuade them to use extreme measures at the expense of Japan itself\". Takagi roared back at Saito, \"If we don't secure that help then our country will be destroyed anyway\". He then turned to Matsumoto and the Foreign Minister, \"Sir, right now we've suffered horrendous casualties and if we have to commit ourselves to more major engagements, we'll lose our entire military. That sent a chill throughout the room for several minutes as everyone considered the ramifications before Matsumoto said to the foreign minister, \"Signal our ambassador in New York and send the report to him\". He then turned to Saito and said, \"I'm sorry but the general's right, even if it is an incomplete report at the moment we should use it right now\". Before Saito could say anything, the prime minister replied curtly, \"Everyone here is dismissed\". He got up and left the room with the others soon following him out the door towards their own rooms. United Nations, New York: In his quarters, Ambassador Shintaro Okino waited with his staff for word from Japan. When the Gyaos swarmed landed in Japan, the country lost nearly all outside communications with the rest of the world and it was only with the use of the satellites, internet, etc by which Okino could communicate with his government and receive the updates. The beeping of the computer and the fax machines broke the silence as information started to stream in from their home. As aides went to find out the content of the information, one of the secure phones started ringing for several moments before Okino picked it up. He spoke into it for several moments before directing one of the aides to give him the printed information to look at for a few moments. After finishing the conversation on the phone, Okino turned to his staff and said, \"Well looks like its up to us to truly secure the help of the world to defeat this threat\". He paused before saying, \"Make copies of these and send them to the five permanent members while I call up the secretary general\". The others rushed to their duties while the Japanese ambassador phoned the UN secretary general's number. Several hours later, the streets of New York leading to the UN became crowded again as scores of limousines drove to the building under heavy guard. As soon as the Japanese ambassador's limousine arrived at the UN, Okino emerged into a sea of reports. After struggling to make their way to the entrance to the building, Okino made his way to the secretary general and shook his hand before saying, \"Thank you for arranging the meeting on such short notice\". Although the UN had prepared for future meetings to keep an eye on the situation in Japan, the announcement of the present meeting caught everyone by surprise. Soon the UN Security Council was in session with the large screens already activated and displaying the photos and images from Japan. After the last ambassadors took their seats, the Secretary General spoke to the council, \"Thank you all for coming so quickly\". He paused before saying, \"Since the last meeting, you all know that the situation in Japan has grown worse\". He paused before continuing, \"For clarification of the severity of the situation, the Japanese ambassador will present the details for us and I ask that you give him your full attention\". Shintaro Okino bowed in respect before he began to speak, \"I can sense that you all feel hesitant after the last meeting about dealing with these creatures\". He paused before saying, \"Well now the situation has changed and now we cannot wait anymore for your decision\", \"As a compromise for anyone who is truly undecided, we'll show you the latest footage from Japan\". He then nodded to one of his aides who turned on the screen and soon images of the fighting as well as data on the two kaiju scrolled through the screen. Soon the whole room erupted in quiet conversation as the screen continued to instantly change while small camera sounds occurred in the background. After the slideshow ended, Okino took a deep breath before saying, \"I know that perhaps many of you may be considering your options here but let me remind you that the Gyaos creatures have also attacked in other regions across the globe including Egypt, the Philippines, Mexico and several others\", \"If we don't stop them now then the rest of the world is in grave danger\". He then bowed to the secretary general before sitting back down in his chair while the secretary general opened up the room to the other members of the Security Council. The US ambassador was the first to speak as he turned to the Japanese ambassador and said, \"From the information you have shown us all, it seems that extreme measures are the only ways that we can destroy these beasts\". He then turned to the rest of the council and said, \"The American commanders in the Pacific have reported back to the president about the fighting and although he is prepared to fully assist, the president has stated his doubt about the effectiveness of conventional weapons to combat the monsters\". China's ambassador also joined in by saying, \"I have to agree with my associate from the United States and the fact that there is not just one or two of the Gyaos creatures but many\". He paused before turning directly at the Japanese ambassador and said, \"If we are to assist, then we must have assurances that we can use every means at our disposal to defeat the threat\". Okino winced at the reactions of the other council members but knew that they needed help to stop the Gyaos swarm. He attempted to try a compromise approach, \"I understand your fears about the matter but as you know about my country's stance on nuclear weapons\". He then paused before continuing, \"I'll have to talk to my government about it so let's leave it on the table for now\". The American ambassador cut in by saying, \"No we must decide now\". He then turned to the secretary general, \"Sir, I must tell you all here that the president has given conditional assistance but if we suffer tremendous losses for little gain in foreign lands then we must respectfully decline\". Suddenly the whole room erupted into loud voices as the others focused their attention on the American ambassador. Standing his ground, he said, \"You all saw the same pictures didn't you\", \"If we don't have access to use everything in our arsenal then the chances of winning shrink to perhaps even zero\". The secretary general considered all of this for a moment before saying to the American ambassador, \"I understand your words but we all must remain calm\". He then took a deep breath before saying to everyone else, \"Right now we have to concentrate on giving the Japanese as much help as we can since this is also a problem of the world as well\". He then nodded to Okino to continue, which the Japanese ambassador greatly obliged. Turning to the rest of the council he said, \"Right now we're trying to discover ways to ensure that our conventional weapons can prove truly effective against the creatures\". Okino then said, \"With the information we have gathered here today we hope that you can gather more information and we can all pool our resources to combat this threat\". He then sat down while the secretary general spoke again to the council. \"Although the crisis may seem overwhelming, to quickly resort to such measures would undermine our efforts even more\". The secretary general paused before continuing to speak to the council, \"Perhaps those measures may be required in the near future but not at this very moment\". He looked around at the room to see the silent looks everyone had before finishing, \"Does anyone have any other thoughts on the matter\". At this, the Russian ambassador raised his hand before saying, \"I understand the need for cooperation on this but as the American ambassador has stated, this will require a large amount of our individual military resources\". He paused for a moment to adopt a more conciliatory tone, \"While I speak for everyone here in terms of wanting to help, I would also imagine that we should tighten up our own air defenses\". The other ambassadors murmured in agreement but Okino cut him off by saying, \"We believe that all of the Gyaos creatures are now in Japan so we should concentrate our combined forces there\". He took a sip of water before finishing harshly, \"If we don't stop them now then they'll eventually overpower us\". His outburst silenced the room for several long minutes before the American ambassador spoke to the audience, \"While the United States still has reservations about these creatures, we will provide as much help as possible\". Okino breathed a sigh of relief while the others watched in surprised shock as he continued, \"If you have attempted to ensure the best odds possible then I guess we would have to join in as well\". It took a moment before the secretary general nodded at the American's statement before saying to the audience, \"I have considered the statements of the parties in the room and now it is time to come to a decision\". He paused for a moment to consider his options before deciding, \"I suggest that we submit this resolution to a vote within the hour, thank you all gentlemen\". With that he exited the room with the other ambassadors following them out, the press assaulting them with questions every step of the way. As Okino and the Japanese delegation exited out of one of the hallways, the ambassador turned to his associates before saying, \"It seems we still have some work to do\". He was about to say more but the American ambassador approached and exchanges were made before Okino said, \"Well that seemed to be an interesting development\". The American ambassador nodded before his face turned grim, \"I want to apologize for that outburst there\". The Japanese delegates nodded before the ambassador continued on, \"You must understand that while the president is very willing to support this, high casualties for no perceivable gain will affect his options\". He paused to turn around and look at the other delegates before saying back to his Japanese counterpart, \"I'm guessing that is what the other more lenient members of the council are thinking\". Okino grumbled before turning to the American and saying, \"We both have a lot of work ahead\". Understanding almost immediately, the two groups headed off to meet with the other delegates to gain insight about their own views of the crisis. After three hours, the council gathered itself back into the chambers with everyone looking more tired than when they had exited the council. As both the American and Japanese delegations took their seats, they turned to look at the other grim faces within the council before all heard the secretary general spoke again, \"After careful consideration this council is ready to vote on this issue\". He then paused before saying, \"All in favor\"? Okino turned to look at the rest and to his surprise relief, the five permanent members voted in agreement on the measure before turning to hear the secretary general talk about the results. After the speech finished and the council dismissed, Okino and his staff breathed a collective sigh of relief before he spoke into his microphone, \"I will relay these results to my government immediately\". With that, the council began to scatter as the secretary general adjourned it. After the Japanese delegation entered its limousine, they all pulled out drinks while preparing a message to send back to Tokyo. All around the Northern Pacific: Not long after the meetings, the nations in the Pacific Ocean began mobilizing their forces and sending them off to Japan. Scores of aircraft flew to the bases that were located as close as possible to the battle zone while ships loaded up with weapons before leaving port and heading towards the coasts around Japan at maximum speed. As for the forces already in the battle zone, some elements maintained standing patrols while the rest refitted with any weapons they could get their hands on. It also gave the men, especially the pilots the chance to unwind and to find a way to relieve themselves of the horrors they had witnessed. For those forces already on Japanese soil, there was no chance to rest and unwind for flying overhead were their targets. All they could do was to try to rest in their underground shelters while awaiting the inevitable call to action stations. Up in space, a score of satellite hovered over Japan while photographing every square inch of the four main islands. Once they had taken photos of the now nearly black landscape, the satellites sent the signals back to their respective owners, whether they would be government or privately owned. If there was one thing that linked all of the owners at this very moment, it was their common reaction when they saw the images of Japan in its present state. Somewhere off the coast of Shikoku: Deep within the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the ancient turtle monster Gamera rested while regaining his strength. The monster had fulfilled the goals that its creators had instilled into it to the best of his ability but he was only one creature against a whole civilization that had many millennia to build up the numbers. Staying out of the way, several Oyashio class Japanese submarines shadowed the turtle monster so as to serve as an early warning system when Gamera rose to the surface of the ocean. They had a mix of torpedoes and cruise missiles in the tubes in the case that they ran into trouble themselves. While healing his wounds, Gamera's mind also searched for any information about the Gyaos that his creators stored in his mind before the Gyaos wiped them out. After doing that, the monster closed his eyes for a moment before rising up from the shore and heading back towards the Japanese shore at a slow place. Once the submarines detected his movements, they also engaged their engines and began to follow him while keeping their distance. Although it was not widely acknowledged at this very moment especially in the higher ups, the common soldier had come to the realization that Gamera was the best chance for the world to defeat the Gyaos swarm. Underground Command Center, Tokyo: The American generals who were already on the main islands were conferring with their Japanese counterparts when the flash message from the submarines arrived. Once they got it, some of them grumbled at the monster's actions before they headed to the radar screens with General Takagi asking one of the aides, \"What units are in the area\". The aide immediately compiled the information while Takagi looked at the radar screens before saying out loud, \"Get radio contact with the units in the nearby area and put them on the speakers\". Voice soon began to filter through to the speakers as everyone turned their attention to the impending combat action at hand. The Coast of Shikoku: Along the eastern shore of Japan's smallest main island, scores of Gyaos rested in the vicinity of the remains of their victims. Although seemingly asleep, the Gyaos kept alert for any sign of intruders while restraining themselves from killing each other. In their hidden shelters the Japanese troops observed the actions of the Gyaos. It would have sounded boring except for the fact that the shelters could easily become their own tombs. When they heard the phones ring, the sound actually scared them for a moment before their superiors picked it up to find out new orders from Tokyo. Once they relayed their location and conditions on the ground, the officers ordered their men to really take cover in anticipation of the impeding firefight. Far out into the sea, the warships of the assembled international fleet moved into range for them to use their cruise missiles while using their radars to keep an eye on Gamera's progress. Once the monster reached a certain point, smoke engulfed them as they launched their weapons towards the mass of giant birds waiting on the shore. It took a few minutes before the missiles landed on their targets with some exploding on the Gyaos outright while others broke into pieces which sliced some more Gyaos into multiple pieces. Sufficiently angered but the sudden attack, the small Gyaos swarm took to the air with their mouths screeching loudly and harshly. While a few circled high in the sky, the rest few at lower altitude as if they were protecting their own designated territory. When they did not spot any enemy heading their way, the Gyaos creatures began to tear into each other in a frenzy of bloodlust until a large wave of fireballs slammed into several of the Gyoas and exploding them outright. As one the Gyaos turned to see their ancient enemy heading at them at full speed and more fireballs coming from his mouth. Once Gamera spotted his foes surrounding him, he dove down to the deck while blazing away with his main weapon at both air and ground targets. Any Gyaos that avoided the fireballs usually met the blunt ends of his arms as he sliced away in all directions at close quarter targets. Even though they were deep underground, the \"trapped\" soldiers and civilians shuddered as they felt the explosions occurring right above them. As they attempted to filter out the shaking and sounds of battle, the units in the area attempted to relay the information back to Tokyo. Underground command center, Tokyo Although very far away from the developing action, the sounds of battle chilled everyone in the room. Some of the Americans gritted the teeth while the Japanese remained stony faced as the explosions filtered through the loudspeakers. After listening for several more minutes, Admiral Koga turned to one of the naval aids and asked, \"Any other ships in position yet\". The aide nodded before mentioning that several other escort squadrons sailing into the area and Koga roared out loud, \"Tell them to launch their missiles now\". He then turned back to observe the battle along with the others. After watching the battle for a few more minutes, General Otaki turned to his American counterpart and asked, \"Can you sortie any of your fighters from your carriers or Okinawa to assist\". Ferguson paled for a moment before saying, \"We can sortie from our carriers but those from the fighters from Okinawa will take some times and the Gyaos on Kyushu could ambush them\". Although he didn't quite understand reason why his Japanese counterparts sympathized with creatures such as these, he did understand the need to get good allies wherever they could find them. He paused before saying, \"All right then, I'll order the fighter units on Okinawa to engage those at Kyushu to pin them down while the carriers engage at Shikoku\". He hurried to one of the consoles while Otaki turned to rejoin his comrades observing the action. Skies above Shikoku: The explosions of the battle between the two ancient enemies lit up the sky in a mix of orange and yellow. It turned into a \"one-way\" dogfight with Gamera shooting up everything in sight while the Gyaos swarm brought enormous numbers to bear. Debris rained down all along the eastern coast of the island with some of them starting small fires in this least populated of the four main Japanese islands. Knowing well enough that soon his foes would outnumber him, the turtle monster immediately dove back down to the ground before letting lose with a score of fireball shots in all directions. When some of those fireballs impacted on the ground, the Gyaos suddenly went berserk and soon their attacks began to really sting Gamera. The turtle monster instantly changed course back towards the ocean with the birds on hot pursuit and others soon got in front to block his path. Caught in the crossfire Gamera began to suffer another round of wounds while the Gyaos pressed in their attacks from all sides. Suddenly though a wave of explosions occurred among the Gyaos swarm forcing them to break off their attack and search for their new assailants. Those assailants soon made their presence felt in the form of sea-launched SAMs and American F-14s and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Flying in at full throttle, the American pilots fired all of their weapons in the hope of gaining a few minutes of breathing room against their numerous foes. Suddenly spared from impending doom, Gamera roared before heading into the fray with a swarm of fireballs from his mouth. Several exploded from the direct shots while the rest scattered while blazing away with their yellow energy beams at their targets. Those same targets struck back with the human forces flying around Gamera so as to take advantage of the monster's protection while providing some in return. Suddenly the sky began to clear up for a few moments which the turtle monster used to retreat back to the ocean while the fighters broke off the engagement and flew away at full throttle. When the Gyaos birds could regain their senses, they saw the sky cleared of their prey. Seething with rage, the Gyaos birds headed back towards shore while still hacking away at each other in their crazed state. Soon a rain of debris from the Gyaos birds landed on the eastern shore of Japan while the hidden soldiers looked on in surprise before reporting this back to Tokyo. Underground Command Center, Tokyo: When they received the report, its contents surprised the commanders about the fact that it showed the Gyaos actually killing each other. After Otaki read through his copy several times he turned to his colleagues and mused, \"Has anyone have any ideas on how we can replicate such scenarios\"? The others all agreed with his thoughts but had no ideas themselves, which somewhat depressed the Japanese general as he continued to read through the report. It took a while for everyone to notice the aides waiting with satellite photos in hand. As soon as they looked at the images of Japan, Otaki turned to one of the aides and said, \"Find out where Professor Nagamine is and bring her down here\". He then turned back to Takagi who also had the same look of horror on his face after looking at the satellite images. The two Japanese commanders looked at each other for a moment before Otaki whispered, \"I never thought that I would have to face an enemy that could conceivably wipe us off the face of the Earth\". Soon both Nagamine and Kusanagi arrived in the room and when they saw the photos themselves, both Japanese women paled as they realized what this meant. Nagamine turned to Otaki and said, \"It seems that we have an enormous problem on our hands\". She paused before continuing, \"We must find a way to locate all of those nests and destroy them all or they'll just simply overwhelm us\". One of the generals was about to say something but Nagamine answered him straight away, \"The single Gyaos that we all encountered back in 1995 managed to lay a large number of eggs\". She paused for a moment to ensure that her next words would have the desired effect and they did, \"Combine this with the large number of Gyaos that we're encountering right now and you'll have a doomsday scenario on your hands\". Author's Notes: I'm betting you're all surprised by how the meeting at the UN in this chapter turned out. I guess it was because of the way modern nations usually wanted to fight wars, mainly to get it over as quickly as possible with few casualties. In this case and against such odds, the idea of using nuclear weapons sounded a tempting idea since conventional weapons seemed to have marginal effect against the Gyaos. If you want a comparison then think about the chaos in Somalia in 1993 and then the result of it which includes the problems in the Balkans during the late 1990s. I seem to want to give my characters a very hard time and this is no exception. Add the problems of the Gyaos reproducing to the problem of the Gyaos swarm itself and the attempt to get international help as soon as possible and then you see that the main characters are in very ugly trouble. Surprisingly, I had a small firefight in there and although unplanned, this is pretty much what will be happening for next few months in this story's timeline. I didn't do much of a description because I wanted to save it up for future chapters. Author's Questions: How well did I do the human sequences? The reason why I asked is that I wanted to write it somewhat differently from what you all saw in Godzilla: World Monster War and Godzilla: Operation Final Strike (In those two stories, there were some disagreements but the forces of humanity managed to work exceptionally well to combat their respective threat). Right now I'm trying to see if I can bring in some of the characters from Gamera 2: Advent of Legion. Any ideas on how to introduce them. As always, please read and review.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Countdown to Counter-Offensive Underground command center, Tokyo: As he finished up some paperwork, Prime Minister Matsumoto rubbed his eyes as he felt the strain of the last few weeks catch up to him once again. Ever since the crisis began and he moved into the underground complex, Matsumoto felt as if he entered a prison. Already several people had succumbed to madness while others were forced to take breaks every few hours. The only few times anyone could move outside and above ground would be when the military would make a supply run to the area and they only had a window of a few minutes before they had to scuttle back inside or die at the hands of the Gyaos. So busy with his own thoughts and the work in front of him, it took time for the Prime Minister to notice the aide waiting at the door. When Matsumoto saw the aide, he asked somewhat annoyed, \"What is it\"? The aide said calmly, \"Sir, its time for the briefing\". Matsumoto immediately looked at his watch and groaned before he got up from his seat and headed to the main conference room. On the way there, he stopped by the makeshift cafeteria to grab a small bite to eat. In the makeshift conference room, everyone was busy own private discussions as they waited for the Prime Minister to arrive. Once he did, they all stood at attention before Matsumoto signaled them to rest easy before they all took their seats. He then turned to Nagamine and said, \"I hope that those results that we discussed earlier have borne fruit\". Nagamine nodded before she said, \"Although we've mainly conducted lab tests as well as only a few live exercises, the results seem promising\". She looked over some of her papers for a moment as several large screens came on as they displayed information about the Gyaos creatures. As footage from 1995 and from the recent engagements began to play, Nagamine began her briefing, \"As we all know, the skin of the Gyaos creatures is impervious to most of our weapons\". She paused before continuing, \"From our tests of the cell samples, we have determined that that the skin is enormously stronger than even the best titanium alloy\", \"However, recent footage has perhaps revealed a way to counteract this problem\". She then turned to the screens where everyone saw the gun-camera footage from the battle playing. As the audience watched, it showed that several pilots using a mix of their guns and missiles to take down their targets. Although the combination took down a few Gyaos, it did at a faster rate than buy using only guns, missiles, or rockets. Nagamine continued to speak while the footage played itself out, \"As you can see, even the strongest protection can crumble under a combined assault by different means\". Pausing for a moment, the scientist then finished by saying, \"Of course it depends on the type of weapons used to take down a Gyaos\". Everyone looked at each other in the room before Takagi asked, \"Is there any news about combating the Gyaos creatures by other means\". All looked at each other in the room as they considered the general's words. Nagamine considered this for a few moments before she said, \"Right now the scientists in America and Europe have not had much luck in using other measures to engage the monsters\". She turned back to the screens which showed samples of the Gyaos DNA exposed to different types of chemicals and that after a few hours, it returned back to normal\". That produced several groans among the people in the room before Matsumoto said to Nagamine, \"Keep trying to find anything you can on that end\". The scientist nodded before the matter switched to the eggs, \"From the tests that we gathered, right now it seems that the eggs have some time to go before they hatch\". Pausing for a moment, the female scientist continued on, \"From what we can tell, the Gyaos inside of those eggs are virtually defenseless so they should be easy to destroy\". The others talked among themselves at the combined news while Nagamine retook her seat. After several minutes, the Prime Minister of Japan turned to his generals with a hard look in his eyes before asking in a blunt voice, \"So what do you think would we need to pull this off, how long will it take to build up and what damage can we expect\". The Japanese military officers and the American air force general looked at each other for a moment before Takagi replied, \"It will be difficult to do and most of it rests on the help we get from the outside\". Before anyone could ask, Takagi replied, \"We only have enough ammunition to supply a small portion of our fighters for such an effort according to what Dr. Nagamine has stated in her report\". He then turned to Ferguson who began to speak, \"Although the president is debating with Congress at this moment, he has given orders for Pacific Command to provide as much assistance within limits\". The air force general paused before saying, \"If there is a forthcoming operation has a good chance at success then we'll assist as best we can\". The others looked at each other in resignation for a moment before Matsumoto nodded in thanks to the American General before he turned to his Foreign Minister, \"Any word from our ambassadors\". The foreign minister shook his head, \"From what we heard, the other countries are willing to jump in but they're asking a lot in return and they're asking to operation in their own manner\". Pausing for a moment, the old man continued by stating, \"Others have their own problems with this crisis or just want to sit this one out\". Everyone groaned at the statement before Matsumoto had to quiet them down. Once he did, he turned to the commanders, \"Right now concentrate on weakening them as much as possible\". He then turned to the foreign minister and said, \"Find a way to bring them on our side on our own terms since we can't deal with this type of issue at the moment\". Pausing for a moment as his eyes grew cold, he said, \"Remind them that if we fail, then sooner or later it will be their turn\". The foreign minister grimly nodded while Matsumoto turned to everyone else and said, \"Alright anything else we should know\"? The people in the room looked at each then they all looked at Nagamine and Kusanagi before Takagi said, \"Right now we've spotted the most recent location of Gamera and have managed to shadow him\". He then said, \"The monster seems to be healing up at a fast pace\". With that, the meeting ended as the people headed out of the conference room and back to their own quarters. As Nagamine walked beside to Kusanagi, she could see the sad look on her face, \"You didn't seem to be surprised about what the military said about Gamera\". Kusanagi shrugged and said, \"At least they aren't thinking about killing him out of hand\". The older woman nodded before Kusanagi continued on, \"Whatever way this goes, I know in my heart that Gamera still has a decisive role to play\". Both women remained silent as they headed down the hallway. Kaneda Air Force Base, Okinawa Ever since the crisis began, the enormous American air base was a hive of activity as it now serviced a large number of squadrons. Though it was one of the largest in the Pacific, the sudden influx seemed to overwhelm the air staff at times although the constant reshuffle of the forces in the area helped take some of the heat off. That provided little comfort to the base commander as he surveyed the chaos playing out on the tarmac. Putting a hand to his eyes to ward off a headache, he turned to one of the other officers and asked, \"So what is the weather report for today\"? The officer replied, \"Right now we have storms hovering near the area but we should have clear weather in transit but we'll have cloud weather over the target zone\". Scratching his head in worry, the Air Force general nodded before he said to everyone else, \"Alright, signal the squadrons to launch within one hour\", \"That should give time for the men to get some food before they head into the air\". The others nodded and they all went about their duties while the commander looked out at the ominous gray sky. In the pilot ready rooms, then men attempted to catch whatever rest they could or catch up on small talk with each other as they waited for their leaders to brief them on their next mission. Though still young, most had haunted looks in their eyes as they tried to shake off the images of their foes. Ever since the early 1990s, the US naval and air forces felt invincible in comparison even to their army counterparts. Now though, it seemed that air force and, to a lesser extent, the navy occupied the spot the army once occupied in being the most dangerous branches of the service. Soon though, the conversation ceased as several squadron commanders arrived in the room. Once everyone settled themselves in, the briefing got underway with the wing commander starting them off, \"Alright men, you've all been doing this for the past few weeks so other than the usual opposition, hopefully this one will go smoothly for a change\". He then turned to a satellite photograph which showed the northern half of Kyushu around the Sasebo Naval Base, \"While we help clear a path through, we'll launch supply runs to our people already in country\". Everyone groaned at the prospect to the point where one of the squadron commanders said angrily, \"Hey everyone quiet down alright\". When the pilots all shut their mouths, the squadron commander continued by saying, \"I know you all want don't like this work but we just don't have the forces available for anything else at the moment\". The wing commander waited for a few moments before he said for everyone in the room, \"We launch in two hours so check your gear and get some food since it's going to be a long one once again\". The pilots started talking among themselves once again before following their commanders as they filed out of the room. Soon a gaggle of fighters, transport aircraft and helicopters began to take off from Kaneda air base as well as Iwakuni air station. Once the helicopters arrived at the rendezvous point, the aircraft soon joined up and they proceeded to their targets. South of Kyushu: Several hours later, they arrived in Japanese airspace and the many air units soon split up for their respective missions with the pilots looking out at the night sky for any sign of yellow beams or large black birds heading straight at them. Those very creatures would soon oblige them as ground radar and AWACS aircraft detected a large number of Gyaos heading up to meet them. The squadron leaders radioed the transport planes to keep going before they joined in engaging the Gyaos. Soon major air battles began as the fighters tried to keep the numerous Gyaos birds at bay while the cargo helicopters and transport planes flew on to their destination. Even then, some of the birds ignored the fighter escorts and jumped the slow moving larger aircraft. On the ground, squads of men emerged from their hidden shelters as they heard the sound of airplanes and helicopters right above them. They emerged with weapons drawn as the aerial transports landed on the airfields and started to unload their cargo. With the explosions around them as well as the sound of engines hammering away at their ears, the troops quickly unloaded the supplies and scurried back to the shelters before the Gyaos came upon them. Unfortunately, some weren't fast enough as the Gyaos spotted the movement on the ground and some of the birds dove straight at their prey. Even when the men managed to get to their underground shelters, they still were not safe as some of the birds attempted to dig their way through, the resulting tremors turning the underground facilities into tombs. Meanwhile, the fighters desperately tried to stay alive against a more numerous and stronger enemy. Even in groups, the pilots had a very ugly time as the birds swarmed around them at speeds that they could not match while a web of yellow energy beams sliced them to pieces. Once a fighter unloaded all of its ammunition, sometimes within seconds , its pilot immediately gunned the engines to full power to get the hell out of dodge. In the AWACS aircraft and the hidden ground radar stations in Kyushu, everyone watched with grim worries on their faces as aircraft symbols disappeared from the screen in rapid succession. Although they had drowned their own share of the Gyaos creatures the ratio of fighters killed for every bird was still too high for the pilots and their superiors. Once a helicopter finished unloading all of its supplies, it immediately took off and headed out to sea in a random direction before it changed its course to South Korea. As for the cargo planes, they gunned their engines to full power and headed back to Okinawa while several fighters circled them to provide what protection they could. After what felt to the pilots to be an eternity of non-stop combat (it only lasted for several hours) the survivors heard the welcoming words, \"Supply runs complete\". Wasting little time, they dumped all of their weapons at the Gyaos before heading back to their air bases at full power. Though the barrage killed a good number of the birds, some pursed and killed several stragglers before they broke off and headed back to Japan. To the people who watched from the AWACS and the ground radar sites, air missions such as these revealed the scale of the problems they were facing. Some of the Japanese even whispered to each other the hope that Gamera would come back into the fight and soon for they wanted the giant turtle kaiju to do their dirty work. USS John C. Stennis, Part of UNTF 58. 150 miles southeast of Yokosuka Watching one of the radar screens on the bridge of the American carrier, the commander of the United Nations task force felt a sense of awe at the sight of the ships he had under his command. While a large number of warships from several different nationalities surrounded the carriers under his command, an even larger group of warships surrounded the score of transport vessels now sailing close to the coast of Japan. After watching the radar screens for several more minutes, the rear-admiral turned to the others and said, \"What do our recon reports say about the opposition\"? One of the officers handed him a satellite image and then began to speak while the admiral looked at the photograph. It showed a relatively small number of Gyaos near the landing areas that they would be targeting for this particular operation. The carrier task force commander then asked, \"Is everyone ready to go\" to which they all nodded before he said, \"Sound general quarters, launch all our aircraft and signal the ships to proceed\". Throughout the water, ships began to get underway as aircraft and helicopters took off from the larger vessels before they headed east with the fleet following right behind it. On their decks, sailors manhandled every weapon they could find for they had learned through harsh experience that the only way to beat a kaiju was with massive firepower. Inside the large transports, scores of men hauled equipment and supplies to the helicopters or landing craft that they would use to get to shore. Once they checked everything, the crews sat down and waited for the inevitable contact. Sometime after 1:00am, the lead ships soon had the shoreline of Japan on their radar screens and they immediately relayed this back to the flagship while signaling their crews for battle stations. As the commander of the task force looked at the message for several minutes, he looked out at the night sky for a moment before thinking that now they would have to go in even without surprise and stealth on their side. After checking the status of his carriers, he then turned to the other officers, \"Do the people on shore know that we've arrived\"? One of the others nodded in the affirmative and the commander turned back to look at the radar screen for a moment before he said, \"Signal all units to begin the attack\". Almost instantly, scores of cruise missiles leapt out of their launch tubes before they flew towards mainland Japan. Following that, the three aircraft carriers launched all of their planes into the air while the other ships sailed towards the coast. Near Yokosuka: Right beneath the waves of the devastated harbor, several submarines continued to patiently observe the Gyaos birds as well as the devastated terrain while they waited for new orders. Although they had taken individual potshots at the enemy onshore, they mainly sat tight at the bottom of the bay while gathering information. When word of the delivery of another batch of reinforcements came through the communications net, the captains of the submarines immediately ordered action stations while they looked at the periscopes at the shoreline. Once everyone was ready to go, the weapons officers on the submarines made the final checks before the captains gave the order to begin firing and soon the subs shook as they launched their entire complement of cruise missiles. With only a few seconds flying time, they would certainly not miss their targets. On shore, the Gyaos slept in a circle around their eggs but their keen senses picked up danger approaching. Almost acting as a single entity, the birds took to the sky as a hail of cruise missiles exploded all around them. While the barrage killed some of the Gyaos, the rest emerged unharmed although very angry as the constant explosions devastated the nests. In their hidden shelters, the waiting troops watched with wide eyes as explosions continued to pound the area around them. While some cowered under the vicious hail of explosions, others watched the skies and the ocean for any sign of the attackers. With no enemy in sight, the crazed Gyaos began to tear into each other with wild abandon. However once their eyes picked up the sound of aircraft heading their way, the creatures turned as one towards the new prey as missiles exploded all around them. As the huge armada of fighters approached the swarm, the pilots winced at the scale of the opposition and several said small prayers before they headed in to engage their foe. Soon, an enormous air battle began in which the fighters attempted to take out the Gyaos already in the area before more arrived. As the soldiers in the shelters looked out at the aerial show, a colonel walked in behind them and said in a loud and harsh tone, \"Alright men, you all know that we'll be receiving a supply run in an hour so you all know the drill\". He then paused before saying, \"When the ships arrive, establish a perimeter and hold as best you can until the operation is complete\". The people in the room looked at him as if he was crazy but the look in his eyes told otherwise and they quickly shuffled out of the room with the colonel following them after he took one last look at the shoreline with binoculars. The air battle continued to rage on unabated as the air fleet used its temporary numerical superiority to kill as many of the black birds as possible. Using a rapid combination of machine gun and missile fire, the fighters managed to take on the beasts with some measure of success. When the ships caught sight of the shore and the air battle, they immediately added their own firepower into the action although it caused trouble for the pilots due to fear of friendly fire. For their part, the few remaining Gyaos suddenly went berserk as they started to blaze away at everything in sight with their yellow energy beams. It lasted for a few minutes due to the sudden shock but the combined missile fire and the rage of the Gyaos helped blow the rest of them out of the sky. As soon as the transports got close enough to shore, landing craft and small boats began to emerge before they headed towards the beach with helicopters flying overhead. Meanwhile, the fighters and ships formed up into a perimeter to defend against long range threats. With the skies cleared and the ground secure, the troops emerged out of the rubble. The sight of ships coming in and the devastated city of Yokosuka provided a stark contrast to the haggard men as they made their way to the beaches and docks. Soon all focus turned to the task at hand as supplies and equipment flowed in and the civilians and wounded flowed out. Unfortunately, while the flow of people inward proceeded smoothly, the flow heading outward ran into trouble due to the swarm of stranded civilians now attempting to flee from the hell they've been stuck in during the past few weeks. Back on the ships, the crews kept watch and attempted to process the wounded through as quickly as possible before trying to squeeze them into any space they could find. The radar operators had the most important job for right now, the ships were putting up enormous energy from their radar systems as they attempted to look for any incoming hostiles. From the bridge of the carrier, the task force commander watched as the operation continued to proceed at a brisk pace, hoping that it would finish soon but unfortunately, that wish was not fulfilled. For after two hours, the radars picked up more Gyaos heading for them. When he heard that, the fleet commander signaled the other ships before he called his counterpart on the ground with an agitated tone to his voice, \"We've just spotted a swarm of Gyaos heading our way, how much longer do you need\"? To the ground commanders, the news struck them like a thunderclap and they said as much before yelling for their men to get to cover. It came just in time for a new swarm of Gyaos descended wildly onto the landing zones and even before anyone opened fire, the Gyaos had already made fresh new kills by either grabbing them with their claws of using their yellow energy beams. Once they pulled out of their dives, a storm of fire greeted the giant birds sending them into a rage as they dove after the new targets. Though very much surprised, the fighters and anti-aircraft defenses fought back hard as they tried to kill as many of the large birds before more arrived. However soon the speed and strength of the beasts as well as their large numbers began to tell as they forced the fighters and ships into a desperate defense as the ground forces scurried back down to cover. As yellow energy fire raked the landing zones, the commanders on the ground as ordered their troops to get back into the shelters while the air defense units attempted to cover the withdrawal of the ships. While most of the large cargo and transport vessels managed to clear out of the area, some were not fortunate as the yellow beams sliced ships in half or when swarms of Gyaos ripped the ships to pieces. When the Gyaos spotted the remaining air defense units, they wiped them out within seconds. As the ground commanders observed the last of the ships heading back out into the ocean, they radioed the UN fleet, \"All ships and troops have evacuated to safety, repeat, all ships have evacuated to safety\". Once the AWACS aircraft received the message from the ground, they immediately radioed the fighters to clear out. While the enraged Gyaos nabbed several stragglers, most managed to escape though they had almost ran out of ammunition and were low on fuel. As the skies began to clear of friendly aircraft, one of the air force commanders looked at his colleagues before he whispered to them all, \"How long can we keep this up\"? Some of the other commanders knew what he meant for they had taken a long look through the passages of history before they settled on the Battle of Britain. United Nations, New York City 11:30pm Eastern Standard Time Ambassador Okino sat in the room watching the permanent members of the Security Council privately talking with each other as they waited for the UN secretary general to arrive. As he looked down at his watch, the Japanese ambassador considered the latest reports that Tokyo had sent him as well as the news from the other ambassadors and it wasn't good. Already the combatants had lost a lot of their forces against the enemy during the past few weeks and it seemed that it was getting even stronger. Suddenly, an aide announced the arrival of the UN secretary general and Okino stood up along with everyone else once the man arrived and sat down at his desk. After taking a sip of water, the secretary general got down to business, \"I know that right now it seems foolish to consider launching an all out offensive but after reading the reports that you've all seen yourselves, I do not really see any other choice\". A view-screen activated behind him and it soon showed Japan and the red marks which designated clashes between either the air fleets or Gamera and the Gyaos swarm. There were also large blotches of white on the map as well which designated sightings of nests of Gyaos eggs and although they had already crossed off some of the nests, others had appeared to take their place. Turning back to the representatives, the secretary general continued on, \"Before we go on the air, I wanted you to see the information and ask for your own advice\". He waited as everyone else looked at each other in the room for a moment before the small conversations began. It lasted for several moments before everyone turned to look at the Japanese ambassador who winced at the others for putting him on the spot. Regaining his composure, Okino turned to the secretary general, \"I understand but it may be difficult to persuade the prime minister of the necessity of the action\". Noting their grim looks, the Japanese ambassador hastily continued, \"However he understands what you've all done and he may be receptive to your inquires on the matter\". \"Let me contact my government and I'll get back to you on that\". That seemed to satisfy everyone in the room and the secretary general nodded at the Japanese ambassador before he turned to everyone else in the room, \"We'll reconvene with the rest of the council to discuss it more before we go to the press\". All nodded and with that the meeting concluded as the Secretary General walked out of the room with the rest following behind him before they departed for their own consulates. Underground Command Center, Tokyo When Okino's report arrived in Matsumoto's hands, he summoned everyone for a meeting to discuss the contents. As everyone looked through their copies of the report, Matsumoto carefully observed their emotions for several moments before he asked the others in a grim tone, \"After the recent engagements, do you think that we can actually launch a general offensive\"? Everyone looked at each other for several long moments before Takagi answered the Prime Minister, \"If it can benefit us in the long run then I'm all for it\". Before the others could reply, he added, \"Although we have been holding our own, the Gyaos seem to sprout out of the ground\". The general then finished by saying, \"Eventually we'll be overwhelmed by the kaiju\". The others listened carefully for several minutes before Matsumoto asked, \"Do you have the exact location of each one of the Gyaos nests and can you take them all out\"? The commanders in the room looked at each other for several long moments before Otaki replied to the Prime Minister, \"We've located most of them but some are more heavily defended than other nests\". The Lieutenant General paused for a moment before continuing on, \"Even if we launch a perfectly prepared offensive, we'll lose a large portion of our forces\". That sent a chill through the room before one of the other ministers told the Prime Minister, \"Sir, the re-supply runs are barely meeting our requirements and if we don't do something soon, we'll have a large problem with the civilian population\". Taking a deep breath, Matsumoto turned to Minister Saito, Nagamine and Kusanagi and asked them, \"Since you three have the most experience dealing with the menace, do we really have any choice here\"? The three looked at each other for several moments before Nagamine told everyone in the room, \"I may not have much experience in such matters but I have to agree that we have to move now\". She paused to let her words sink in before she continued to speak, \"Once those latest eggs hatch then we've lost\". Turning to Kusanagi, the Japanese scientist then finished by adding, \"However, the operation will cost us all heavily anyway\". The unspoken meaning of her statement hung over everyone's head before Matsumoto stood up from his seat and announced to the room, \"After carefully hearing all of your opinions on the matter, I have decided to agree to the request of the UN\". Before anyone could intervene, the Prime Minister told them all, \"I want you all to begin plans for the operation while the foreign minister talks with the other nations as well so that we can easily coordinate our plans\". Seeing that there was not much to say, the rest nodded in agreement before everyone departed out of the conference room. As Nagamine and Kusanagi headed back to their own quarters, Kusanagi took a deep long breath before she whispered to the older Japanese woman the thick chilly air, \"Soon the storm will truly break upon us all\". Author's notes: The supply missions in this chapter are similar to trying to supply the Resistance during World War II. In this case, it is the Japanese military which is acting as the Resistance against the Gyaos. The reference to the Battle of Britain was due to the fact that it was basically an aerial version of a war of attrition between the Royal Air Force and Hitler's German Luftwaffe. Of course you can also compare it to the aerial version of guerilla warfare in terms of whoever has the better staying power. I had to draw on remembering what I read about invasions and providing air cover for the scene where the fleet helps supply those groups that were on the coast. Considering the fact that the fighting is about to get very rough even though it already has, well I had to use the old \"A storm is coming\" line. If the battle scenes seem to lack detail in this chapter then I apologize, I also tried to make them take less space in the hope that it will help me on the matter. Next chapter: The first stages of an enormous air offensive get underway.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Lighting up the shadows of the night. Underground Command Center, Tokyo, Japan Late evening For the past three weeks, the military staffs throughout the world struggled to put together a workable plan. A combination of the list of problems they would face in pulling it off, the nature of the threat, and the politics had forced the staffs to revise the plans several times over bitter arguments. After multiple revisions and long nights, the staffs had now come up with a plan that they could all agree with and now they had to convince their respective superiors. As the command staff of the JSDF headed towards the conference room they all had grim looks and small circles around their eyes as they considered the briefing that they were about to give to their audience. After several moments of uneasy quiet, Koga commented, \"If we had this much trouble trying to convince ourselves that what we've planned here is necessary then trying convincing the Prime Minister and the other heads of state\". Takagi commented back to the admiral, \"While they may not like what we're about to propose to them, what we've witnessed during these past months should convince them of what needs to be done to beat the Gyaos\". He didn't have to add that none of them really liked the idea at all but it was the best they could come up with in the limited time span. Soon they entered into the conference room where Matsumoto and his ministers, Nagamine, Kusanagi, and other guests exchanged small talk before they all turned to look as the officers entered the room for several moments. Matsumoto then nodded to the others and they all took their seats as the JSDF officers set up their equipment. It took a few minutes before everything was ready and the briefing began. Takagi stood up from his seat and took a long hard look at everyone before he began, \"Thank you all for attending this meeting\". He paused before continuing on, \"As you know that despite our forces fighting bravely along with the others as well as the assistance from the monster called Gamera, the Gyaos continue to multiply rapidly\". \"Eventually their numbers will be too great for us to handle and eventually humanity will perish\". Seeing the grim nods of agreement, Takagi continued on, \"So after conferring with our counterparts overseas, we have drawn up plans for an all out counteroffensive\". That got the civilians talking as they instinctively understood what that meant, \"I understand what you're all saying and if you must know, none of us like the idea as well but the other choices are just as bad if not worse\". Pausing for a moment, he then stated, \"I believe that my colleagues will better outline the plan\". He then sat down as the other generals took to the podium to present their part of the plan. First up was Otani who steadied himself before he outlined the aerial part of the plan, \"The main front in this battle will most certainly be in the air and without it, and our other elements will fail in their own missions\". Pointing to the map, he continued, \"The mission will kick off with simultaneous air strikes from the airbases surrounding Japan\", \"Once the Gyaos have engaged the air units coming in from the surrounding areas, we'll join in with our own air assaults\". Pausing for a moment to get his words across he continued to speak to the audience, \" With luck , we'll lure as many of them away so our ground forces can achieve their own objectives\". He then finished by stating to everyone in the room, \"I believe my colleagues can explain their own elements of the plan in greater detail\". Bowing to the audience, he then exchanged nods with Koga who immediately took his place. Looking to ensure everything was in order, the commander of the JMSDF briefed the audience on his service's part of the plan, \"The naval units will provide fire support to our air and ground units as they engage the monsters\", \"Also we'll also destroy as many nests that we can get to with our missiles\". Looking at the map for a moment he then finished by stating, \"One of our most important missions however will be for the submarine fleet to act as our picket fence and our air coordination during the battle\", \"The other missions is to keep an eye on Gamera and when it is time, to attempt to lure the kaiju to the birds\". He then sat down as the commander of the JGSDF headed up to the podium to deliver the part of the plan that the ground forces, which didn't last long due to the fact that the commanders of the JASDF and the JMSDF had already covered many elements of the JGSDF's participation in the plan. Once the general had retaken his seat, an uncomfortable silence descended on the room for several moments before Matsumoto asked quietly, \"Are you sure that there is no other option we can take\"? Takagi shook his head in the negative and his eyes told Matsumoto some of the other options that were all on the table and those options displeased him as well\". He then turned to Nagamine and asked The scientist already had her answer, \"We should have enough to outfit everyone for the assault although it may not come soon enough if those eggs start to hatch\". Looking at her notes and remembering her own experiences, she then added, \"Even though the Gyaos have proven very active in the daytime, I would advise against launching the attack at night since do to do would encounter the largest amount of resistance\". The others looked at her incredulously for several moments as they considered her words for a moment before agreeing with the statement and then Matsumoto asked, \"What do you mean about the eggs\"? Nagamine grimaced before delivering the bad news, \"From what the satellites and the samples have shown us, it seems that in about a week and a half or less, the swarm will increase dramatically\". Looking at the most recent report, she then added, \"It will take more than that to ensure everyone is ready\". All in the room emitted a groan as they absorbed the bad news before Matsumoto asked the scientist, \"Can you find a way to speed it up then\"? Afraid of where this was leading but realizing that she had no choice, the scientist simply stated, \"We'll do everything we can\". Nodding at the acceptable answer, the Japanese Prime Minister then asked out loud, \"What about our people that are still on the surface\"? All looked at each other as they considered the thought before Minister Okino replied sadly, \"Of course we'll try to get to those survivors but our shelters are crowded as it is and we believe that there are only a few\". Takagi jumped in by stating, \"Plus to try to rescue them would divert desperately needed resources from the attack itself and at the rate we're going, we need everything we can get our hands on\". Sobered by the reports, Matsumoto nodded and took a deep breath to consider the information he had just heard before he turned to Nagamine, \"I'm sorry but we have to push the offensive forward so you have three days to get ready everything on your end\". That news stunned the two for several moments and they tried to think up of ways to dissuade the prime minister but seeing that there was no choice, they grimly nodded. With that the meeting ended as the prime minister stood up from his seat and headed back to his quarters. Soon the rest also departed with some heading back to their quarters while the rest headed for the center to transmit the attack orders\". Both Nagamine and Kusanagi walked down the hall in silence before Nagamine turned to her young friend and remarked silently, \"You were somewhat subdued back there\". Kusanagi shrugged before replying back, \"There really wasn't anything that I could have said\". Pausing for a moment, she then added, \"I'm pretty much a regular civilian in comparison to you all\". Before Nagamine could reply, the teenager continued, \"Even the information that I've found out about when I was back in the states really doesn't compare to the information that you've had to deal with\". Nagamine smiled at her friend's thoughts before telling her, \"Well in the profession that forces us to deal with creatures such as this, every piece of information one discovers should be considered since it may prove to be important\". Her voice then took on a very earnest and perhaps grateful tone, \"And so far despite the fact that most of the generals and politicians really don't like you that much, the information you've learned as well as your experience has really helped out a lot\". Airbases surrounding Japan While the generals and admirals all over the world briefed their counterparts about the planned assault, scores of aircraft flew to the airbase that surrounded Japan. Already filled to capacity with their own air units, the base commanders, particularly on Okinawa and the other island bases, had to find creative ways to squeeze in more aircraft onto the tarmac as well as their maintenance crews. Meanwhile, the commanders at the multiple bases were busy attempting to coordinate their respective operations so that when they had to go in, they would be able to attack simultaneously from all directions. At the airbase in Kaneda, the JASDF and USAF officers poured over notes from the recent battles as they attempted to organize the constant counterstrikes. All had deep worn looks as they read the latest combat reports and empty cups lay all around the room. After a few moments, one of the Japanese officers turned to ask his American counterpart, \"Can you keep up these attacks on the Gyaos nests or do your men need to rest\"? One of the other American officers answered in a very angry tone, \"Yes if you want to kill them all\", \"Other than that, I suggest that all squadrons stand down for now\". One of the senior American officers in the room silenced the younger man with a wave of his hand. He then turned to answer the Japanese officer, \"You have to understand sir the casualties our own squadrons have taken have been very high and we've already had to make adjustments\". Pausing for a moment to let it all sink in, \"If we continue like this then we won't have any squadrons left to use\". Though the Japanese officer understood what his American counterpart meant, it still grated him and it showed when he replied back, \"I understand but if we don't keep up the pressure then the Gyaos swarm will grow stronger\". He then paused to take a sip of his drink before he continued to speak, \"Also these continuous attacks have allowed the new pilots to gain some experience, which should be better than none at all\". Another American officer growled before he replied back in an angry manner, \"Yes indeed they do but they last only for a while and perhaps they don't even survive their next mission\". The room turned silent for several moments before the lead Japanese officer in the room attempted to change the subject by asking, \"Do we have word on the other bases as well\"? Some of the others shook their heads before the officer took a deep breath and said, \"Well then, you'll probably get your wish in terms of attempting to get some rest\". All nodded in thankful agreement but the arrival of an aide with a message in his hand and a grim look in his face soon changed that, \"This just came in from headquarters and it orders all airbases to be ready to go within a few days\". All in the room emitted groans as they knew what the message meant and an American officer admitted as much when he asked out loud, \"I wonder how everyone else will take this damm news\". 250 miles Southwest of Tokyo Early evening Meanwhile, the warships circled the four main islands with their radars turned on and weapons ready to fire once they received orders from above. As the already large fleet continued to grow, its commanders had already launched training exercises to help integrate the new arrivals. Watching the radar screen aboard the USS John C. Stennis , the admiral of the task force winced as he spotted a mistake then turned to the clock before wincing once again. Turning to look at the window, the naval commander took a deep breath before telling one of the other officers, \"Alright that is enough for now so tell the others to cease and chopper the commanders here so I can talk to them\". While the other officer headed off to signal the other ships, the admiral turned to look outside at the clear night sky as he considered what he was about to tell them. Although the new arrivals learned quickly, he as well as the already \"old\" veterans knew that the mistakes done in training could kill a soldier in actual combat, especially against a threat such as this. After watching the last Seahawk helicopter land, he headed down to one of the briefing rooms where the other commanders waited for him. The others were busy exchanging conversations with each other but when the admiral arrived in the room, everyone saluted him before most went for their seats. Once the UN naval commander took to the podium, he looked at his audience for several moments before he began to speak, \"Well you've managed to advance far but somehow it seems that you guys have been doing the same mistakes and eventually they'll get you killed\". Some, mainly the veterans, nodded while the rest jumped up to defend their performance but the admiral immediately argued back, \"Though you guys have learned quickly, it may not be quick enough\". He didn't mention the orders he received from New York for that would have hurt morale even more, \"I know that you all mean well but if you looked at what you're facing, then you'll realize that any mistake that you make in combat will cost you your life and I need as many live personnel as possible\". That got the audience talking as the admiral in charge of the UN naval forces stepped down and several of his operations officers headed up to the podium in turn to brief the audience on a multitude of subjects. They ranged from giving information about the Gyaos and their locations in Japan, the strength of the military might assembled to meet them and other matters that they would need for the task at hand. As the audience listened in on the briefing, the UN fleet commander watched with a grim satisfied smile as he saw the audience's mood. Just then, a communications officer burst into the room, \"Sir, we've just received this from central command\". He immediately thrust this into the admiral's hand and bowed before departing the room. The UN naval commander looked at it for several moments before his eyes widened in shock as he realized what this meant. Looking at it for several more minutes so as to check that he understood word by word, the admiral crumpled the paper in his hands before turning to everyone else and making an announcement that they would most certainly hate, \"Gentlemen, it seems that time is up for we're going on the attack\". Before anyone could object, he continued by stating in a cold tone, \"Please alert your men and do what you can to get them ready within the next few days\". Seeing that there was no point in arguing, the squadron commanders began to file out of the room with many of them in a dejected tone. As the admiral watched them all depart, he did not blame him and when the last person left, he punched the wall with his right hand for several moments while crushing the paper in his left hand before he threw it into a wastebasket and left the room for the bridge. Seas around Japan 2:30am, Tokyo time During the past few days, scores of submarines all over the world moved into position offshore of the main islands while they used their periscopes to scan the coastline. While they were capable of hurting the birds, they functioned primarily as reconnaissance units and as gatekeepers as they observed the swarm. In an Oyashio class submarine, a Japanese rear admiral and his staff looked through the periscope at the coast for several minutes before he switched with one of his subordinates. After the others took their turns, the rear-admiral turned to one of the communications officers and ordered, \"Raise the array and prepare to contact both the other submarines and then contact Tokyo\". As the communications officers went about their business, the rear-admiral took another peek through the periscope to ensure that he didn't miss anything. Once he moved away, he said for everyone on the sub's bridge to hear, \"This is going to be a very interesting battle to watch\". He then asked, \"What time do you expect the planes to arrive\"? One of the others told him that they had just started taking off. Airbases in the Pacific: Dawn When the dawn began to emerge in a particular time zone, the airbases in the area began to scramble their complements of planes into the brightening sky with AWACS and enormous tanker aircraft leading the way. Once each massive air group reached its position, it then headed for the rendezvous with other aircraft heading in the general direction. Soon the separate air groups merged together to form an enormous air fleet to rival that seen during World War II. At Kaneda, Osan, and other bases nearby Japan, the base personnel watched with anticipation as the last planes took off into the sky. Once the fighting start, they would have much business as the survivors returned to re-arm. Also, there was a good chance that once the shooting started, the Gyaos birds would follow the survivors back so the personnel manned the air defenses while evacuating the civilians in the surrounding areas. Japanese airspace: 5:50am Ever since the Gyaos swarm descended upon Japan, the airspace around the Home Islands had been virtually empty of aircraft. Although some did nearby, most of the flights over Japan consisted of military planes as they clashed with the Gyaos swarm in local engagements. For the past few days though, a deathly silence hovered over the area, which was punctuated by the sound of surviving animals and the growling of Gyaos as they slept near their nests. Soon though, the sounds of hundreds of jets broke the silence over the horizon as they darkened an already gray sky. Roaring in at different speeds and altitude, the air armies soon reached the sea around Japan. Once in, the AWACS transmitted the information to the waiting ships which had already gone to action stations when the sun came up. In Tokyo, everyone crammed the rooms to watch as the radar screens and satellite systems highlight the positions of the planes in relation to the Gyaos nests. After several moments, Prime Minister Matsumoto turned to General Takagi and nodded at him for a moment before Takagi activated the communications link, \"Commence the attack\". A huge cloud of smoke soon engulfed the sea around Japan as the ships and submarines started launching every missile they had in their armories. Once they depleted their missile stocks, the fleet formed a tight ring of steel with all anti-aircraft weapons manned as the huge air armada screamed overhead while supply ships moved in close to replenish the warships. When the ground started to shake under the swarm, it awoke the Gyaos in frenzy as they searched to the sign of any enemy prey. They would not have to wait long before a swarm of cruise missiles exploded on them or right around them. Some of the missiles could bore through the hulls of American aircraft carriers while others split apart to form bomblets which sliced and diced the many nests. Thrown into a feverish excitement, the Gyaos took to the air by the swarm and soon started slaughtering each other while more cruise missiles began to pour in. As the ground shook above them, the soldiers and the remaining civilians all huddled together in fear as small amounts of dirt began to rain down upon them. It shook them so much that their commanders had a difficult time trying to calm their men down. As for those waiting in the underground hangers with the planes, the shaking unnerved them the most as well as the raining of dust all over them as they attempted to keep their planes in good condition. Although the missile fire soon ceased, the Gyaos still went at it for several more minutes before some of them picked up the sound of aircraft heading their way. They immediately turned and dodged as an enormous wave of air-to-air missiles slammed into the swarm. When the smoke cleared, a large number of Gyaos still remained and they all turned angrily and dived headlong into the enormous air fleet. Stunned beyond belief, the fighters launched everything they had while heading in for evasive maneuvers as the two opposing forces closed. Soon, the two \"walls\" crashed into each other and it became difficult to separate enemy from ally while the Gyaos sliced, diced, and blasted everything in sight, which included killing other birds as well. On the AWACS aircraft, the front-line commanders winced in horror as they heard the sounds of a large scale air battle that came straight out of World War II. Although they could not privately blame them, when several commanders from the others nations spotted their fighter squadrons retreating or hanging back from the battlefield, they immediately screamed out into the command net for their men to return to the attack. The rest continued to bore in at full speed on their foe even though they had already suffered heavy casualties. Using superior numbers many engaged the enemy head on while others tried to lure some of the Gyaos into improvised \"killing zones\". Trying to get clear of the battle so as to observe the action for several moments, the pilots watched the fighting gradually move towards the coast although some still remained behind in the air and on the ground to guard the nests. Plunging in to deal with those that remained behind, the squadron leaders ordered the heavy hitters to smash the largest nests. Enormous large bombers roared in from both North and South at maximum speed as they headed for their targets while trying to avoid the dogfights going on all around them. Some did not prove lucky as several stray laser blasts blew the large bombers out of the sky. Most though reached their destination and soon a hail of bombs rained down on the Gyaos eggs. Underground Command Center, Tokyo With the access of multiple modes of communications, the people in the underground command center had a full spectrum view of the action. Satellites and cameras transmitted the visual information while the speakers displayed the audio point view of the action. Once the satellites and radar systems accounted for nearly all of the Gyaos heading out to the seas around the country, Takagi turned to his fellow commanders, \"Now gentlemen lets move to the second phase\". They all had equal looks in their eyes before Takagi yelled all over the command net, \"All units in country are to commence the attack\". Japanese airbases When the airbases heard the news, many looked at each other for several moments before they set grimly about the task at hand. Once the doors for the underground shelters opened up, men and vehicles roared out in a flood as they rushed into defensive positions for they all knew speed was the essence. With the explosions and the roar of the Gyaos in the distance spurring them on, the crews hurriedly readied their weapons to join in the attack. Although hampered by delays due to the lack of training and the constant explosions and screams high above their heads, eventually the remaining planes of the JASDF took to the air to join the massive air assault. Although, the anti-aircraft units could not get a clear shot against the swarm, they did have some good business as several single Gyaos birds headed for the airfields. While the anti-aircraft defenses blew stray Gyaos out of the sky with relative ease, it just put the crews more on edge as the battle continued unabated above their heads. JGSDF were also on the move with small battle groups as they made their way to the devastated cities and towns as well as any nests that were nearby. Whenever they spotted a nearby nest, they would either blow it up outright or send in the engineers to destroy them with explosives. Though they did try to pinpoint every nest, the battle groups roared through the landscape as the soldiers looked up worriedly at the explosions in the sky. Underground Command Center, Tokyo: Despite the introduction of their own forces into the attack, the Japanese commanders could see that the air battle was turning into a stalemate. Though they did manage to secure advantages, it was a tie for the two opposing forces as they struggled to kill each other as quickly as possible. Already they had some ugly scares as the map showed that some Gyaos did penetrate the air screen and it seemed that they would be heading over the ocean to the nearby countries before reserves flew in to engage. Meanwhile, camera footage showed the ground forces roaming the countryside to destroy the Gyaos nests or to rescue survivors in the devastated cities. As they watched the destruction on the screen, the commanders looked at each other for a moment before Otani asked out loud, \"I wonder how much we've already lost thus far in this fight\". The American air force general Ferguson replied back with a tense voice, \"No doubt a lot already\". He then winced as he saw the Gyaos swarm rip several more of his squadrons to pieces. After looking at the radar screens, Takagi took a deep breath as he considered the losses. He immediately turned and asked, \"Are we making any headway against them\". One of the subordinate officers replied from his station, \"We're making temporary headway but right now it is a stalemate\", \"Already we have losses at an average of thirty percent and with some even higher\". Takagi cursed and looked out back at the radar screen for several moments before he spotted Nagamine and Kusanagi would were standing off to the side. As if asking for advice, the general looked at the young civilian for several moments before turning back and yelling out to one of the communications officers, \"Contact the fleet and tell them to proceed\". The others looked at him for several moments as he watched the radar screen again as if they considered him mad but once they looked back at the satellite screen, they agreed with the decision. Pacific Ocean, 120 kilometers northwest of Iwo Jima Looking at their sonar systems, the crews of the submarines surrounding Gamera wondered what they were doing here when a big firefight was occurring up in the north. Also they felt edgy due to the fact that if they would have to wake Gamera in this fashion then more than likely, the kaiju would destroy them first before heading back up to the ocean's surface. Right in the middle of the steel circle and amongst the ridges, Gamera lay at rest while he gathered his strength before venturing out. The only sign of movement came from the long trail of bubbles that came out of Gamera's mouth as he continued to rest on the deep seafloor. While continuing to observe the turtle kaiju intently, it took the submarines a while to receive the message but when they saw it, all groaned for several moments before the commander of the lead submarine activated his communications link with the rest of the subs and asked, \"Does it seems that he will wake up soon\"? The others shook their heads in the negative and the commander cursed before ordering, \"Signal subs to lock in solution on the ridges and then fire\". The submarines first discharged their decoys, which created a huge screen all around the monster before they fired their torpedoes at the ridges surrounding the monster. Despite the danger of dealing with an irate Gamera, the subs kept lock on their torpedoes until the very last moments. Once they all felt the shudder the subs immediately began to back off as their crews attempted to lock on the target. Rudely awakened, the ancient turtle monster swung his arms around for several moments as he tried to ascertain his surroundings. After several futile swipes, the monster roared angrily and immediately ascended to the surface with the submarines observing his movement with great relief. When Gamera ascended to the sky, the monster roared out loud into the night and scanned the suddenly peaceful waters for a moment before he suddenly sensed something off in the far distance. Blinking his eyes for a moment, Gamera growled in anger as he sensed his nemesis before he suddenly headed to the north with his arms stretched out and the rockets within his legs burning at full power. Japanese airspace High above the four main islands of Japan, a murderous aerial firefight occurred between the most modern aerial force thrown up by the present residents of Earth and the creatures that were the products of the haughty arrogance of the previous residents of the Earth. Although they suffered immense casualties, the human forces managed to achieve a very good ratio in terms of killing the Gyaos. However many pilots were already feeling the strain with some of the survivors unwilling to fly back into the fight and their superiors forcing them to at gunpoint or throw them into the jails. Soon this and the casualties the human forces suffered would turn the tide back to the Gyaos with the fighters taking defensive measures. With the Gyaos gaining the upper hand some immediately broke off and headed back inland as they sensed danger from that quarter. Seeing the many devastated nests threw the Gyaos into frenzy and they dove down to the deck as they searched for food and a chance for revenge. Whenever they spotted a relatively intact nest, a few broke off and immediately surrounded it to prevent anyone from attacking it. Pulling out of the battle momentarily, the squadron leaders winced at the air battle before they started to flood the airwaves with requests for assistance. As the communications crews of the AWACS, warships and on the ground attempted to sort out the confusion, multiple radar systems lit up as they spotted a UFO flying up from the south. Before anyone could react, all saw a large circular object flying towards the battle at very high speed and despite both sides bunching up together, the new arrival fired several fireball shots with care at the Gyaos. As the smoke and clouds began to clear, the new arrival revealed itself to be none other than Gamera. Roaring angrily at the swarm, the monster fired more fireballs as he plunged into the fray with several fighter squadrons immediately following right behind. The rest loitered back as the squadron commanders attempted to sort it out with higher headquarters. When they got the order to assist Gamera, many looked at each other for several moments before the numerous fighter squadrons reorganized and plunged back into the air battle. -I drew a mix of knowledge from reading about the massive air operations in the Middle East, as well as from World War II (both the vicious air war over Germany and the later stages of the Battle of Britain (particularly when the Germans launched their first daylight raid on London)). Also after watching a bit of Independence Day, I kinda drew up on that as well (gulps). -In anyone is wondering why there are heavy bombers involved in the attack and why there is no opposition from the Japanese, well consider them in the situation similar to the French having to fire on their own homeland during D-day in Normandy. -If you're wondering, well consider the fact that it would really help if one brought a tremendous amount of firepower to help fight off a conventional foe that is seemingly all powerful. -How well did I do this massive air operation and how realistic it was under the circumstances? -Should I continue this story alongside my other two or just stop right here? Just asking. ","Summary":" Gamera: Invasion of Gyaos.

Just a few things to clear up before you start reading. I'm choosing at random which prompts I use, so I'm not going in order (the prompt I'm using for this one is 24, so the next one won't be 25). This series could get shippy, but there is no way it'll get smutty. Fluff is guaranteed. Well, enough of my blabbering, you've got a fic to read! I hope you enjoy :) They all came from very different families. Don had spent his childhood in a stereotypical happy American family, filled with big smiles, lots of people, and his mother's famous apple pie. Well, famous in their small town anyway. His home was filled with too many people and not enough space, but because Don was the talented one he found himself the centre of attention multiple times. Not that he minded, he lapped it up as much as he could. He owed his current success to his family. If it weren't for them fostering his love for singing, dancing, and acting he may never have become the big star he was today. Though they didn't appreciate him running away to vaudeville, not one bit. (Especially with that boy… He was a bad influence on sweet little Donny.) The bad influence in question was Cosmo Brown, who was exactly the opposite. It was his family that was the problem. His parents yelling at each other at all hours of the night, his sister's bad habits, and lack of funds made it one of the worse places to raise a child. Though it had its upsides – Cosmos' grandfather actually cared about him, and a good 90% of the time he was doing the child minding rather than his parents. The only reason Cosmo had become so close with Don was to escape his hell hole of a home when his grandfather wasn't there. But by the time his father walked out and his mother started drinking, he had long since given up hope of having a decent home life. His family was the main reason he left, and he never regretted leaving one bit. Kathy, on the other hand, had a family that was a bit too perfect. When her father wasn't on a business trip and her mother touring with her orchestra, they were controlling her every move. Every subject at school, every friend she made, every film she saw, everything. She loved her parents dearly, and they gave her the time of day when they could, but sometimes she felt like Kathy Selden didn't exist. She certainly wasn't making her own decisions anyway. When it wasn't her parents suffocating her, it was the housekeeper or the butler. \"Don't do this Kathy, don't do that Kathy, would your mother want you doing that Kathy?\" Sometimes she wished they would just leave her alone. But after Don became a big movie star, Cosmo became Monumental's musical genius, and Kathy became Hollywood's newest leading lady, they came together. They came together to form their own family, not too big, not too lonely, not too restricting. And they loved it.[Chapter 2] Kathy glowered at the newspaper, frowning at the large, bold words on the front page. LOCKWOOD AND SELDEN'S LATEST FILM A FLOP? \"Would you believe that Kathy? A flop,\" Don grumbled, leaning against the counter. \"Well it's not the worst thing that could happen,\" Cosmo mused. Don shot him a frown. \"And what might that be?\" \"Vaudeville.\" Don rolled his eyes and took the paper from Kathy, who by the look on her face hadn't finished reading the review yet. Some of the more scathing comments included, \"Selden's inexperience is most obvious in this picture,\" and \"Lockwood's wooden acting left the audience dissatisfied.\" Kathy had thought it was fine, and the preview audiences certainly liked it. So what gone wrong? After skimming through the reviews Don slapped the paper down onto the bar. \"Wooden acting? It was the script that was wooden…\" \"And I've three movies now. That's hardly inexperienced!\" Kathy complained, making her way to the drinks cabinet. Cosmo reached for the paper and glanced over it, and then with a smug smile, he said, \"Hey, at least they liked the music.\" \"Well done you…\" Don muttered, to which Cosmo replied with a theatrical bow. Kathy took a sip of the drink she had poured herself then set it down on the bar, \"Looks like you've broken your record, Don.\" \"My record?\" Don could be incredibly oblivious at times… \"Successful films. You've never had a flop in your entire life,\" Kathy told him. \"Yeah, and even your stunt man ones did well,\" Cosmo added. \"I guess you're right. But who knows what this could do to my career…\" Cosmo rolled his eyes, \"One flop isn't going to ruin your entire life, you know. This is hardly The Duelling Cavalier .\" \"He's got a point,\" Kathy nodded. Now Don was the one rolling his eyes. He had a habit of blowing things out of proportion. In his eyes this could be even worse than The Duelling Cavalier –it got a theatrical release and everything! \"You never know what one bad film can do.\" With an exasperated sigh, Kathy poured herself another drink.[Chapter 3] Lina was in the process of fixing herself a sandwich when suddenly, the phone rang. She glanced over at the telephone, it's shrill ringing not unlike her own voice. Dropping the butter knife, she trotted over to the phone, heels clacking on the wooden floor of her Hollywood manor. \"Hello? Lina Lamont speaking,\" she trilled. \"Lina? Hey, it's Zelda. You'll never guess what I just heard from R.F,\" Zelda whispered. Lina frowned. Was she hiding from someone? R.F maybe? \"Yeah? What?\" she asked, leaning against the wall. \"You remember that Kathy Selden girl? Y'know, the one who hit you in the face with a-\" \"Yeah yeah, I know the one…\" Sometimes she still caught flecks of cake in her hair. \"Well, this is worse than cake! She's dubbin' your voice, Lina!\" Lina nearly dropped the phone, her face flushing bright red, her mouth hanging open like a fish. She gulped, took a deep breath, and returned to the conversation. \"Whaddya mean she's dubbin' my voice? No one can dub Lina Lamont!\" Lina paused, \"Hey Zelda, what's dubbin'?\" \"They're using her voice instead of yours,\" she could almost see Zelda's eyes rolling. \"For the singin' and everything?\" Lina's hands were shaking. \"Yeah. Everything .\" \"WHAT?\" Lina squeezed the phone so tight her knuckles went white. How dare that little wretch steal her spotlight! The audience wanted to hear her, not some silly Coconut Grove floozy! Not even Donny could stand for this one… Well, even if he did, Lina sure wasn't! \"You stay right there Zelda. I'm comin' over!\" Lina declared, slamming the phone down. Forgetting about her unmade sandwich, Lina stormed to the door and grabbed a hat and coat on the way out. Stomping so hard the stone path could crack, Lina made it to her car. Ripping the door open and stepping into the pristine white vehicle, she sped down the road to Monumental Studios. By the time the day was out, that Kathy Selden would be out of the picture, and Lina wanted to make sure that she'd be the one to do it![Chapter 4] SINGIN IN THE RAIN – FAN FIC 100 CHALLENGE – NO 8. WEEKS Don and Cosmo had only been in the vaudeville business (if you could even call it that), yet they'd already been booted out of three troupes and outright rejected from five. It had been more difficult than Don had expected, but he never once regretted it. He didn't even regret that he'd picked the one guy who had the weakest immune system in America to run away with. He was just glad that he'd been born as strong as an ox, and had enough talent to get some money from dancing on the streets. The last thing they needed was a night with no dinner. But the colder winter got, the sicker Cosmo got, and the icier the streets got, the fewer people were out walking. It also made the concrete incredibly difficult to dance on, but Don didn't mind. He had no choice, really. \"You doin' ok?\" Don asked after shoving the frost coated door of their tiny shack open. \"What does it look like?\" Cosmo grumbled, pulling the thin cotton sheets in closer. Don looked over his red feverish friend. \"You look wonderful,\" he said mockingly. \"Don't I always?\" Cosmo responded, but he managed to lose his voice half way through. Don frowned. He'd been like this for a couple of weeks now, yet there was no sign of him getting any better. At the same time, there was no sign of him getting worse, so there was always that. But ever since Cosmo got himself in this state, Don always had this sick feeling in his stomach that one day he'd come back to find Cosmo gone, or even worse – dead. But that wouldn't happen, would it? Don walked over to the corner Cosmo was huddled in, the frozen floorboards creaking underneath his worn out leather shoes. He crouched down beside him, and Cosmo shuffled over to give him room. \"You shouldn't really be this close, y'know,\" Cosmo looked up at him, voice raspy, \"I could give you the plague.\" \"You don't have the plague, bonehead,\" Don said with a soft smile, putting his arm around Cosmo. Despite his previous protest, Cosmo leaned into him. Don was surprisingly warm, and he was so cold… Cosmo shut his eyes, the feeling of sandpaper in his throat and the fire in all around him disappearing for the first time in what felt like ages. He liked Don. Maybe more than he realised. \"Cos, if you're still like this next week we're going home,\" Don looked down at him, knowing that threat would jolt him into full recovery mode. But Cosmo didn't respond, and for a moment Don's heart stopped. But when he saw the younger man's chest slowly rise and fall, he relaxed. He was just sleeping. Don leaned back, the cold from outside filtering through the cracks in the wall and chilling him to the bone. He was overreacting, Cosmo was stronger than he gave him credit for. But he still worried – he wasn't sure if he could live this life on his own. All Don needed to do was wait, then before he knew it Cosmo would be waking him up at the crack of dawn with tickets to the next train out of wherever they were. A thought occurred to him. What if a change of location would help? There were opportunities everywhere, and one of those opportunities could be a steady paying performing job. Pay he could use to help Cosmo… Silently, Don started packing what little things they had, praying to God that things would get better. a/n. I know this has little to do with the prompt, but I could not contain my shipping no matter how hard I tried! Anywho, if you read my Disney AU as well as this, then you'll know from the last chapter that I want to start a new story. If you don't, then here's what's going to happen. I've got a list of stories I want to write on my profile, but I can't decide on which one! I only want to write three stories at once, and I'm already writing two (this one and the Disney AU), so I can only write one. So I've decided to let you decide! Instructions to get to the poll will be written below. This site doesn't let me directly copy and paste links, so here are my crappy instructions. Type www. then strawwpoll. then me then /10661832. The poll should be there. Thank you for voting and I hope you enjoyed this update! (I certainly did, heh heh ;)[Chapter 5] Don often forgot that Lina had the capability of being a decent human being. Believe it or not, Lina wasn't always the vicious, petty beast she made herself out to be. Beneath the layers of fur and rage, there was a decent person hidden deep inside – you just had to dig down to find it. This side of Lina Lamont would come out to play in two circumstances – when she was behind the camera, or when something genuinely terrible had happened. That was only when Don had seen the elusive kind version of Lina, so it was unknown if there had been any other instances. His memory of the first time he met the other side of Lina was blurry, but he could still remember the most important parts. Why was it blurry? Because of a concussion, that's why. - 1924 - It was during the filming of their first picture together. The plot to this one was a thin one, filled with love triangles and convoluted murder plots. Don didn't think much of the film itself, he was there for the stardom and the rather handsome paycheck. They were filming the dramatic finale, where Lina was being held hostage by the killer and Don was rushing to save her. Nothing out of the ordinary – Don had seen it on the big screen a billion times before. But this particular scene involved Don dashing down a set of stairs that hadn't treated anyone kindly. They squeaked no matter how much pressure was put on them, some of them had broken with actors still on them resulting in splinters galore. But it was the cheap rug that covered them that was the problem this time. It wasn't laid out flat. A bump at the top was considered rather dangerous, and it soon proved itself when it came to filming the finale. Don waited with anticipation for the Roscoe to tell him the camera was rolling, frozen in a ready to run position. After what felt like hours, he gave Don the go ahead, and the young actor started his mad dash down the stairs. But his foot caught on the aforementioned bump in the carpet, and before he knew it Don was sent tumbling down the stairs, ending the accident with his head smacking into the hard wooden floor below. He hardly recognised the shrieks and commotion around him – everything was spinning. He was expecting someone like Cosmo or the extra he took out for dinner last night to rush to his aid, but to his surprise, Lina was the one at his side. \"Oh Donny, are you alright?\" she squealed, kneeling down beside him. Don only responded in a groan of pain. The actress furrowed her brow, and her voice was so shrill that he heard every word of it through the ringing in his ears. \"Can you hear me, Donny? Do you need some water? I can get that for you… Oh, Donny, you look terrible!\" The words flew out of her mouth at a rapid pace, and they soon started to meld together into nothing but a blur of noise – and not a pleasant one. He felt her hand cupping his head and heard her calling for someone to get the first aid crew. \"It's ok, Donny, the doctor people are comin'. You just rest now, ok?\" her voice sounded different, slower, gentler… deeper? Before Don passed out, he looked up at her. She was evidently worried, that he could see. \"Hey, Lina…\" \"Huh? Don't speak Donny. I don't think it's good for ya.\" He gave her a bleary smile. \"Thanks… Lina…\" Then he was gone. a/n. Hey everyone! So voting in the poll I mentioned last week has come to a close, and I've come to a conclusion to what story I'm going to write next. With a whopping two votes on the entire thing (and they were both for the same story), the story I'll be writing next is the reimagining of three Disney films! It will take a while for the first chapter to be up, but keep an eye out! Hope you all enjoyed this update![Chapter 6] With the coming of talkies, films had to stop relying on pantomime to tell stories. They needed class, they needed real talent, and most of all they needed heart. When all they had to do was pull a face and flap their arms about it was easy – but now they needed real emotion. And the moment Don Lockwood started talking it was the best thing Cosmo had ever seen. Before all Don's acting had been was – for lack of a better word – silly. There was nothing real about it, and his complete lack of chemistry with Lina made it even worse. But now that he was up there, speaking those glorious words and meaning every syllable – Cosmo was overjoyed. Because now the world was seeing the real Don Lockwood. Cosmo knew that every word he said to his co-stars were genuine because he'd said things to Cosmo and Kathy in the exact tone. Cosmo figured that was why Don had remained successful through the silent to talkie transition. He had such a big heart that it showed through in his performances – every emotion was just so real. So as Cosmo sat with Don and Kathy at his side, watching the premiere of Don's latest film, he decided that this one was better than all of his silent films put together. \"Do you think they'll like it?\" Don leaned over, whispering in his ear. Cosmo nodded. \"If they're anything like me they will.\" Don smiled – good God it was a wonderful smile. Cosmo was glad to be the reason for it. It was not long afterward that he felt Don tap on his shoulder. \"But what if they aren't anything like you?\" Cosmo rolled his eyes. \"Come on Don. It's you! They'll lap up anything with your face on it.\" \"How do you know?\" Don seemed oddly concerned. \"They did every other time.\" Cosmo frowned, looking over at the burly actor. \"You ok?\" Don shrugged. \"I don't know…\" \"Shh!\" Kathy shushed them with a slap to both their shoulders. \"I'm trying to watch.\" \"Sorry,\" both men said sheepishly, and Kathy nodded with satisfaction once they kept quiet. Cosmo leaned over to Don and whispered into his ear, quiet enough so Kathy wouldn't notice. \"Maybe this will make you feel better?\" Cosmo leaned in and gave Don a quick peck on the cheek. Public displays of affection were risky, but the room was dark and people were preoccupied. No one would notice. Don gave a goofy smile, then gave Cosmo a kiss of his own – on the lips this time. Now it was Cosmo's turn for a goofy smile. Finally, the two of them settled into watching the film. Cosmo couldn't help but feel like the luckiest man in the world. Because Don Lockwood – the man with the biggest heart in Hollywood – had decided to share it with him. And that was the best feeling in the world.[Chapter 7] Singin' in the Rain. The posters were everywhere. On the sides of buildings, in the theatre, in bus stops… Everywhere Lina went, Singin' in the Rain followed. Monumental's happiest musical since The Dancing Cavalier! See Don Lockwood singin' up a storm with his latest leading lady – Kathy Selden ! You'll be dancing all the way home! It should've been her up there. It should've been another Lockwood and Lamont classic. Audiences should've flocked to see Lina Lamont singing again. She should be the one smiling on that poster, not Kathy Selden. She hated Kathy Selden. The moment the film premiered everyone was talking about it. It was more than just posters now, there were people. Singing the songs everywhere she went, little girls pretending to be Kathy Selden in the park and little boys pretending to be Don Lockwood… Sometimes Lina would lock herself away in her home just to escape it all. Not that she'd have her home for very long. No paycheck meant no money to pay taxes and bills, and if they weren't paid she'd go into debt. Then she'd have to sell her house. Sell all her precious possessions just to get by, then get into more debt. There was nowhere where Lina was safe. Either the looming threat of bankruptcy or endless bombardments of Singin' in the Rain . There was no way to get out of it. She hated Kathy Selden. Lina had occasionally tried her luck at other studios, trying her best to remember how Ms Dinsmore had told her to speak. But even when she did the producers just laughed at her, bringing up the premiere of The Dancing Cavalier . They would put on silly voices and sing Singin' in the rain . They never stopped mocking her… Lina left all the studios in tears. One time she considered going back to Don. Maybe he would help her get her job back? By now she didn't want anything glamorous – anything that gave a decent paycheck would do. But then she remembered. Kathy Selden. She would be there, smiling her bright smile, fixing her coffee and a sandwich, being every bit as sickly sweet as Lina remembered her. She hated Kathy Selden. She wanted nothing to do with Kathy Selden, she never wanted to see her round, innocent, sweet face ever again. But then she did. \"Lina?\" It was raining. She had no umbrella, she had no makeup, her hair wasn't done up. The clouds were grey, and so was Lina. But there was Kathy, in a bright yellow raincoat with a bright red umbrella. Lina gave one glance at the actress, her brow furrowed with concern. Without saying a word, Lina ran away into the grey day. Kathy was calling after her, but Lina kept going. She was crying, salty tears mixing with rain. She hated Kathy Selden, for America's newest sweetheart had singlehandedly killed Lina Lamont.[Chapter 8] With Don being the busy guy that he was, it was often the case where Cosmo and Kathy would go home without him and he would follow. Tonight was one of those nights, and it also happened that also on that night a storm had hit Hollywood, and if there was one thing that Kathy hated more than anything else in the world – it was storms. Kathy took a sip of water, her hands shaking. With every crash of thunder and every crack of lightning her fear grew. She hated storms, and she hated the fact that Don was out in it. \"Any sign of him?\" she asked as Cosmo came back from the window. He shook his head. \"Nope, nothing yet.\" She'd assigned him to keep an eye out for Don, though there had been no luck for the past hour. Kathy leaned on the bar, biting her lip. \"I hope he'll be ok…\" \"I wouldn't worry. This is Don Lockwood we're talking about, remember?\" \"Yeah, I guess…\" Kathy still had the vivid memory of being lost in a storm when she was very young. She was in the park with her nanny, and she'd run away from her after a hissy fit. A storm started when they were apart, and a lightning bolt had struck the tree Kathy was sheltering under. She'd hated storms ever since. When the loudest strike of thunder yet hit, she abandoned her drink and ran for Cosmo. He pulled her into a tight hug, stroking her hair to comfort her. It was working. \"It's alright Kathy,\" he said, \"Hey, let's go to the couch. We can listen to the wireless.\" Kathy nodded, and Cosmo lead them to the living room. She sat down on their plush sofa, wiping her tears away while Cosmo put the radio on. The tinny singer drowned out the storm a little, but not enough for Kathy to forget about it. \"So are you just worried about Don? Or do you just not like storms?\" Cosmo asked as the younger woman snuggled up beside him. \"Both,\" she sniffled. \"Well, there's nothing I can do about the storm, but I can tell you that Don will be fine,\" he reassured her, but Kathy needed more than that. \"How do you know? Storms are dangerous…\" \"I've seen Don brave worse than this.\" Cosmo gazed out the window, but there was still no sign of their burly friend. Kathy looked up, her eyes wet with tears. \"Yeah?\" Hoping that his story would calm her down (he hated it when she cried), he told her the story of the train to Bakersfield. The rain came bucketing down, and Cosmo could see inky black clouds forming on the horizon. He leaned back in his seat, sighing in frustration. Trust Don to be late… The train was leaving in five minutes! Maybe he'd need to adapt their act to a one man show… Cosmo took one last glance out to the dirty train station, and who should he see sprinting down the platform but Don Lockwood. Soaking wet with a piece of paper in his hand, he came rocketing down the platform at a speed Cosmo didn't know was humanly possible. Suddenly he slipped and fell face first on the stone. Cosmo would've laughed, but the train started moving. Eyes wide, he opened the window of his compartment. \"Run Don! Run like you've never run before!\" Hearing his friend's calls, Don picked himself up, brushed himself off, and started his sprint all over again. The train was starting to gain speed, and Cosmo kept yelling at Don to run. Fortunately, the train was old, clunky, and slow, and Don could easily catch up to it. He reached the edge of the platform and jumped – no – leaped onto the train, grabbing onto the railing surrounding the open end of the train car. Cosmo's eyes got progressively wider as Don hoisted himself up and over the slippery rail and onto the wooden floor. He raised his arms in victory, but doing so meant the piece of paper flew from his hands in the gust. Don watched with his jaw dropped as the paper drifted into the wind flew into a tree branch, and then the tree in question was struck by lightning. Now Cosmo was laughing. Don trudged into the train and collapsed beside Cosmo, who was still snickering. \" Dammit…\" Don grumbled. \" All that for a girl's number!\" Cosmo guffawed, earning him a scathing glare from Don. \" You should've seen her, Cos! She's was all curves…\" Cosmo slapped his friend on the back. \"Well, at least you tried.\" Don was complaining all the way home. Kathy looked at Cosmo with wide-eyed disbelief. \"You mean he did all that to keep a girls number? In weather like that?\" Cosmo nodded. \"Y'know, even if he did hang onto it, he never would've called her.\" \"To preoccupied with you, I suppose?\" \"You're a smart woman, Selden.\" Suddenly another lightning strike sounded, and the clap of thunder shocked Kathy into stillness. But instead of returning to her original state like Cosmo expected, she started to laugh. \"I can see why he became a stunt man!\" Kathy cackled, and her laughing was so infectious that Cosmo started too. They were so distracted by themselves that they didn't even notice Don walk in, soaking wet. He frowned. \"What're you two laughing at?\" Composing themselves, the two of them turned to face Don. They said in unison: \"You!\" a/n Brownie points if you get the Swing Time reference ;)[Chapter 9] SINGIN' IN THE RAIN – FAN FIC 100 CHALLENGE – NO 35. SIXTH SENSE Over the many years that Don had worked with Lina, he'd developed a sixth sense. It first appeared in 1925 when they'd had one of their biggest arguments yet. Don was… enjoying himself… with Cosmo when suddenly he felt her presence. Yes, the six sense of Don Lockwood were sight, touch, scent, sound, taste, and Lina. He could tell when she was coming from a mile away, and it wasn't because of her voice or the sound of her footsteps. There wasn't anything in particular, actually, he just knew. This came in handy multiple times, like when Kathy was dubbing for Lina during the production of The Dancing Cavalier. \" He'll kiss her with a sigh. Would you? Would you?\" Kathy sang sweetly into the microphone. The dubbing sessions were Don's favourite part of the film – Kathy's beautiful singing, Cosmo looking so happy in his element conducting the orchestra, and the thrill of always being on his toes lest he felt Lina coming. Kathy was halfway through the second verse when he felt it – Lina was coming. Don glanced out the open door. There was no sign of her yet, but she was coming all right. He jogged over to Cosmo. \"Hey Cos, Lina's coming.\" Cosmo stopped conducting. \"Really?\" He turned to Kathy, the members looking frustrated at the interruption. This was not the first time Lina had interrupted a dubbing session. \"Lina's coming!\" \"Oh gosh!\" she cried into the microphone, amplifying the sound. Don and Cosmo clapped their hands over their ears and Kathy cringed while the members of the orchestra started packing up. \"I think she's getting closer…\" Don glanced around the room, looking for somewhere for Kathy to hide. There was only one exit – Lina was bound to see her if she went that way. The cupboards were too small and too full for her to fit inside them, and she couldn't well hide inside the double base case… Could she? Now they could all hear her. She was nattering on to some poor soul and not letting them get a word in edgewise. Either that or she was talking to herself, though both were possible. They were running out of time to hide Kathy. Before she'd just had time to escape before Lina arrived, but now it was too late, and there was only one solution. \"Kathy. Cupboard. Now,\" Cosmo decided, pushing Kathy through the crowds of orchestra members into the closet. \"No! Cosmo, stop! It's too small!\" Kathy protested. \"What's goin' on here?\" came the shrill voice of Lina Lamont, the trill terror. It was an awkward position they were in. Cosmo and Kathy were up against the cupboard in a rather compromising position, and Don had frozen mid run trying to get to them. Cosmo decided that there was only one logical way to go about this, so he kissed Kathy full on the lips. The younger woman gave a small shriek but soon decided that it was better than getting yelled at by Lina. Don acted on instinct. \"Cosmo, how could you?\" he cried. Cosmo and Kathy went on kissing, and now it was looking like they were enjoying it a bit too much… Don walked over to join Lina, feigning shock. Lina looked a bit shocked herself. \"Whaddya mean 'ow could ya?\" \"He was my one true love!\" Don yelled, hamming it up as best he could. \"And now he's left me for a Coconut Grove floozy!\" Now it looked like Cosmo and Kathy were trying not to laugh, but they vigilantly carried on through their passionate love making. \"Your one true…\" Lina trailed off, then looked at Don. \"You're a… a…\" \"A HOMOSEXUAL!\" Don placed his hand on his heart and collapsed to his knees. He decided that this was one of his best performances yet. \"I mean, I knew the piano player was but…\" Lina was looking from Don to the orchestra and then to Cosmo and Kathy, clearly not sure how to act. There was Don, who had just professed his attraction for men, the orchestra who were just about as surprised as she was, and Kathy and Cosmo, whose lovemaking was steadily growing louder and louder. At least they were enjoying themselves… \"Oh my God!\" Lina shrieked, then ran from the room, wobbling on her heels. Don watched as she left, making sure was far enough away so they could resume their dubbing session. \"Alright love-birds, she's gone,\" Don told them, but they didn't seem to hear him. \"I said she'd gone!\" Cosmo waved a dismissive hand, then went back to running it through Kathy's hair. Don got the message and told the orchestra to pack up. He picked up his jacket and started to leave. \"I guess we'll leave you to it.\" As he walked through the halls he passed by Lina's suite, and he could hear her hurriedly talking into the phone. Though she was going too fast for the average human to understand, Don was pretty sure what she was talking about. He continued down the hall, chuckling to himself. At least now she'd leave him alone…[Chapter 10] Kathy loved the autumn. The vivid orange leaves swirling, complementing the dirty brown ones that stayed on the ground. The grey sky contrasting against the bright trees, and – of course – the large piles of reddish leaves dotted all over the place. During the autumn, Kathy took as many walks as she could. Whether alone or with someone else, she still took the time to take in the beauty of the season – though she did prefer to be alone. It was a fine distraction from the hustle and bustle of movie star life. That was half the reason Kathy took these walks alone – it took her away from the rest of the world. Aside from the occasional passerby asking for an autograph, Kathy was completely separated from the world of glitz and glamour. There was no such person as Kathy Selden the movie star when she was surrounded by autumn, just Kathy Selden the person. And that suited her just fine. a/n: Hey guys! Sorry for the shorter length of this one - I've been writing non-stop for a creative writing competition today and frankly I'm completely knackered! The next update will be much longer, I promise! Despite the length, I hope you all enjoyed this one, and I'll see you all soon. Thanks for reading :)[Chapter 11] a/n: Hey everyone! So I'm really sorry about the lack of updates lately. I know how dead the Singin' in the Rain stories are on this site, and I was starting to feel bad about leaving this one abandoned. But, just as I was getting in the mood to start writing again, I went on a holiday which doubled as a laptop detox - so no fan fic for me! Anyway, here I am. I'll update this story every two weeks. I also want to dedicate this story to the late Debbie Reynolds, who played Kathy in Singin' in the Rain. She was such a wonderful woman, and I was deeply saddened to learn of her death so soon after her daughters. My thoughts are with her family, and may she rest in peace. Lina loved Don. Don loved Cosmo. Cosmo loved Kathy. Kathy loved Don. Don loved Kathy. Kathy loved Cosmo. Cosmo loved Don. Don hated Lina. It was a love square to Lina and an annoyance to everyone else. \"You busy tonight?\" Lina crooned as Don read over that day's paper. She pretended not to notice his terribly hidden sigh of frustration. \"You know me, Lina, always busy.\" Even Lina could tell that his smile was fake, but a girl could dream, right? \"Surely you could, y'know, cancel whatever you're doin' tonight? Dinner could be on me.\" Paying for dinner. Now that was desperate. \"I really am busy…\" Lina huffed and rolled her eyes. One day he'd break, she was sure of it. Then they'd have a beautiful, romantic, candlelit dinner and Don would realise that he truly loved her. He'd ditch that Selden floozy and go to Paris with her, and they'd dance and dance and dance… She could also convince him to get rid of that annoying piano player, which would be a bonus. \"Oh, alright. Well, see ya tomorrow Donny!\" she planted a kiss on his cheek, which made Don's eyes pop open. Just a taster of what he was missing out on… As Lina sauntered away she heard Don calling after her: \"I'm busy all week too!\" Lina smirked. Of course, he would be. But one day, Lina would catch him when he was free and offer him something he just couldn't refuse. Then she'd work her magic, and Don would be all hers… \"Can you believe her?\" Don asked Cosmo, who had just approached with a piece of paper in his hand. \"I never have,\" Cosmo replied, handing the paper to Don. Don scanned the paper. It was a note from Kathy, saying she'd be a bit late for her dubbing session. Something about the dentist. Don decided it wasn't worth worrying about. \"What did she want this time? A candlelit dinner on the river bank?\" Cosmo flopped into the seat beside his boyfriend, absentmindedly leaning against Don. The older man nudged him aside. Public displays of affection were dangerous for anyone deemed single by the Hollywood press. Them being gay would just add fuel to the fire. \"Something like that. Though I was planning something like that for you and Kathy tonight anyway.\" Don sent Cosmo a look that was more than flirtatious. \"Any plans for desert?\" Cosmo queried, hoping that Don would catch his meaning. Don took a moment to consider. \"How would you like something a little more… Unconventional?\" \"You know me too well…\" \"You promised me a candlelit dinner on the riverbank. I see no riverbank,\" Cosmo remarked in mock complaint. \"What's this about a riverbank?\" Kathy asked, \"I wouldn't mind dinner by a riverbank.\" Don rolled his eyes. \"You two are impossible to please.\" \"I'm just saying that you've broken your promise.\" Despite the lack of a riverbank, the dinner was perfectly lovely. Cosmo and Kathy often thanked whatever divine intervention had given them a boyfriend with such amazing cooking skills. \"If only Lina could see us now,\" Don said with a chuckle, prompting interest from Kathy. \"Oh?\" \"The lovely Lina was bothering Don today. She was after a date. I guess you can figure out how that went for her,\" Cosmo explained with a wry smile. Kathy laughed, then directed her attention at Don. \"You really do hate her, don't you?\" Don gave her a scolding look. \"Now now. Hate is a very strong word.\" \"But you do, don't you?\" \"Oh definitely.\" Cosmo laughed. \"Why don't you tell her that? She wants you to express your feelings towards her, and hatred is certainly a feeling you have for her.\" \"You think I haven't tried?\" \"Well, the solution is simple,\" Kathy said, earning her a look of genuine interest from Don, \"Just throw a cake at her.\"[Chapter 12] FAN FIC 100 CHALLENGE – SINGIN IN THE RAIN – PROMPT 98: WRITERS CHOICE There were many things that Cosmo Brown didn't know. For example, why the sky was blue. For a long time, that was the great mystery of his life, and he was happy to keep it that way. That all changed one morning when the greatest mystery of Cosmo's life became why he'd just woken up in bed beside Lina Lamont. Taking a moment to process the situation, he wasn't quite sure how to react. Three spectacular things had just happened to him. One, he'd probably just become the first man to see a disheveled Lina Lamont. Two, somehow he'd manage to woo her into sleeping with him. Three, the bed they were sharing was swankier than anything he'd ever slept in before – his bed back at Don's place included. Speaking of Don, as Cosmo slowly rose from the duvets, he noticed his boyfriend splayed across a couch that was much too short for him. God… whatever happened last night must've been a real doozy… \"Don?\" he murmured, then slid out of bed and clambered towards Don. He started to shake him. \"Don! Don, wake up!\" Don awoke with a disgruntled groan. \"Whaddya want…\" Cosmo continued to shake him until he'd woken up completely. Rubbing sleep out of his eyes, Don stared at his friend quizzically. However, when he started to take in his surroundings, his eyes widened. Not even Don had been in a fancier place than this. \"Where are we?\" he asked, and Cosmo shrugged. \"I was hoping you'd know. You're usually the sober one of the group.\" Don frowned. True, he was a notorious lightweight, so he hardly ever touched a drop of alcohol lest he make a fool of himself. But whatever happened last night must've been something special if even Don had got drunk. Assuming they had got drunk. Either that or some weird kind of amnesia had fallen over the both of them. A look of concern fell on Don's face. \"Can you remember if Kathy was with us last night?\" Once again, Cosmo shrugged. Don rolled his eyes and started to get up, but he nearly toppled over. Cosmo had to grab hold of him to stop him landing on top of him. \"Careful there. You might crush me.\" \"Never,\" said Don, and he planted a kiss on Cosmo's forehead. Before Cosmo could kiss him back, the door to their suite swung open. Not realising how dark their room was compared to the rest of the world, the sudden burst of light was not a welcome one. After their eyes adjusted, they managed to focus their attention onto the person silhouetted in the doorway – Kathy. \"Good morning!\" she chirped, then strode over to the windows and threw the curtains wide open. This earned her a chorus of groans from her boyfriends. She gave them a scolding look. \"Now, come on. A little daylight never hurt anybody. And besides, it's twelve o'clock, you should've been up hours ago.\" \"Twelve o'clock?\" Don cried out in disbelief, \"But I've got to be at Monumental at twelve o'clock!\" \"Don't worry your pretty little head about it. I've told R.F that both of you have a bad case of the flu and won't be coming in today.\" Don breathed a sigh of relief. As Kathy went about making them respectable and getting them away from Lina as quickly as possible, Cosmo started to realise something. Unless Kathy was impervious to hangovers, she clearly hadn't been drunk last night. Perhaps, then, she'd know what on Earth went on between him, Don, and Lina. \"Hey, Kathy?\" \"Hmm?\" \"What did we do last night?\" Kathy looked at him with a smile that meant what he'd done last night was incredibly entertaining. Entertaining to her, maybe. No doubt it would be awful for him. Who knew how Don would feel about it, whatever it was. \"Oh, nothing you need to worry about,\" she said, her mischievous smile still playing on her lips. \"Oh, I think I do,\" he retorted, folding his arms, and Kathy gave in with a laugh. \"Well, let's just say that if Lina ever makes an acting comeback, she won't be credited as Lina Lamont.\" Terrible thoughts crossed through Cosmo's mind. \"If I did what I think I did…\" \"Don't tell me he…\" Don murmured. Then, as quiet filled the room, Don burst out laughing. \"Kathy, I better not have,\" Cosmo said, dread filling him. \"Oh yes, you did.\" Kathy was trying not to giggle, a venture which wasn't going very well. Cosmo sank into the sofa beside Don, whose laughter was getting slightly uncontrollable. Soon the room was filled with the laughs and cackles of Don and Kathy, but Cosmo just sat there, mortified. All this and Lina still hadn't woken up. As their laughter subsided, Kathy said as she wiped tears out of her eyes, \"Well there's only one way to fix this.\" \"Oh please tell me…\" \"We need to get you to Reno – and fast!\"[Chapter 13] a/n: Hey guys! So so so so sorry for the wait for this update. I explained on another story that I haven't been writing due to lack of interest, sickness, school, broken down laptops, and (more recently) the theatre! But anywho, I'm on holiday now so I should be able to update more consistently for a wee while. Enjoy the story that strayed from the prompt quite a bit! Despite Don's fairly forward-thinking relationship with Kathy and Cosmo, he was still a little stuck in the times. For example, when their bathroom sink broke, he deemed it \"man's work\" and decided that he and Cosmo were the only ones who could possibly fix it. Even when it was plain to see that Don had no idea where to start when it came to fixing a sink, he still insisted that Kathy stayed away. This, of course, annoyed her to no end. She went to Cosmo (who had already resigned to his lack of skill) with her complaints. \"I wish he'd just let me do it,\" she murmured as the two watched Don from the doorway of the bathroom. Cosmo cringed as water started to spurt into Don's face, making him splutter. \"You've got nothing to lose.\" \"He's just making it worse!\" she whispered angrily. As she watched poor Don trying his best to solve his problems, she just got more and more annoyed. Cosmo leaned over to ask: \"If you don't mind me asking…\" \"Asking what?\" Kathy looked up at him with a frown. \"How do you know how to fix a sink?\" With a shrug, she replied, \"I had a lonely childhood.\" As she finished speaking, a soaking wet Don stood up and stormed out of the bathroom, shoving past both his partners. After exchanging brief, exasperating looks with each other, Kathy and Cosmo followed after him. Don had led them to their bedroom. Cosmo and Kathy both plonked down onto their plush, canopy bed while Don whipped his dripping shirt off. \"Do you think I could have a go now?\" she asked, hoping Don would be too frustrated to realize what she'd asked him. \"No!\" Don said for what felt like the 50 billionth time that day. \"It's not your place – don't worry about it! We can deal with it, right Cosmo?\" But Cosmo was too busy eying up Don's shirtless physique to realize he'd just been included in the conversation. Don rolled his eyes and started digging around in the closet for a dry shirt. Realizing that she'd just found a golden opportunity, Kathy slipped out the door while Don was distracted with his shirts, grabbing the toolbox on the way out. When Don had finished putting his shirt on, he immediately noticed Kathy's absence. \"Did you see her leave?\" he asked Cosmo, who had finally snapped out of his stupor. \"I think you can guess where she went,\" Cosmo replied, and Don walked out as quick as a flash. Cosmo soon followed. They met a rather satisfied looking Kathy in the hallway. She handed Don the toolbox, wiped her hands on her sweater, and said with a smug smile: \"Done!\" \"Done what?\" Don asked, raising one eyebrow. \"I think you can figure that one out too,\" Cosmo interjected. It took him a little while, but Don soon figured it out. \"You mean to say that you fixed it?\" Kathy nodded. \"Yup! It was quite simple really. Now, who's for cocktails?\" The young woman continued on her way down the hall to make their drinks, leaving a baffled Don and an amused Cosmo behind. \"You know Don,\" Cosmo started, \"I really do think she's the man of the house.\" \"Shut up, Cos.\" ","Summary":" a/n: Hey!

Uldis Barznav had to be the only person in the entire base not panicking. The tall, gray-haired man with a bulging belly strode through the underground corridors smiling in spite of himself. Soldiers and technicians and support staff polished tables and doorknobs, scrubbed windows, and straightened the colorful, supposedly inspirational portraits of the country's Great Leader and his late father, the Eternal President. All of them wore hurried, tense looks. Even Major General Sang, the base commander, had a noticeable sheen of nervous sweat on his forehead. As much as he enjoyed this spectacle, Barznav supposed he couldn't blame them. The man coming here had the power of life and death over all of them. Technicians and maintenance personnel and security guards, and even generals, were all easily replaceable. The same could not be said of Uldis Barznav. He was the most indispensable man in the entire country, save for the Great Leader. Scratch that. His value surpassed even that of the Great Leader. Any half-wit could sit behind a desk in P'yongyang and run this dreary, militaristic, famine-stricken nation. Only one man in the entire world could do the things he did. And if the Great Leader wanted his plans to succeed, he wouldn't be so foolish as to stand Uldis Barznav in front of a firing squad because he got a little irritated. Barznav made his way to a paved tunnel that led to the surface. An honor guard in brown dress uniforms with AK-74 rifles tipped with bayonets stood off to the side. \"Doctor.\" A stocky man with a weathered face nodded to him. Like the honor guard, he also wore a brown dress uniform, though a myriad of colorful ribbons adorned his left breast. \"General.\" Barznav nodded back to General Sang as he sidled up next to him. Neither man spoke, their gazes aimed toward the other end of the tunnel. Barznav rocked back and forth on his heels, wishing their distinguished visitor would get here already. He didn't have to wait long. Barely ten minutes after he joined General Sang, a circle of light formed at the end of the tunnel as the entrance opened. Within seconds, two limousines appeared. The honor guard snapped to attention. General Sang stood ramrod straight. Barznav clasped his hands behind his back, trying not to look too bored. The limousines rolled to a stop. The doors of the first one flung open. Uniformed bodyguards sprang out, clutching Type 56 assault rifles. They formed a cordon around the second limo, whose driver exited, stepped over to the rear door, and opened it. And there he was, the short, paunchy man with puffed up black hair and glasses. The Great Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea. The Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. The Invincible and Iron-willed Commander, the Glorious General Who Descended From Heaven, the Bright Sun of the 21st Century, the Shining Star of Paektu Mountain, and the numerous other ridiculous titles the WPK'S Central Committee created for him. Barznav had his own title for North Korea's ruler. \"The Midget.\" Not that he would call him that to his face. As indispensable as he was, even he knew there were lines he couldn't cross, especially with the man who gave him all the money and resources, and all the pretty young girls, he asked for. \"Most Beloved and Respected General.\" Sang saluted as the Great Leader approached them. \"Welcome. We are all honored to be in your presence.\" \"Thank you, General.\" The Great Leader's head whipped toward Barznav. \"Is it ready?\" \"Yes, Great Leader. All our tests have been completed successfully. We can commit it to your operation whenever you wish it to begin.\" \"Our forces are marshalling near the border as we speak. Everything should be in place in another two weeks. Now, take me to it.\" An anxious look came over the Great Leader's fleshy face. \"I enjoy looking at it.\" \"Of course, Great Leader. This way.\" Barznav took the lead, with \"The Midget,\" General Sang and the heavily armed bodyguards in tow. \"You are certain it will not attack our soldiers?\" inquired the Great Leader. \"We exposed it to the People's troops and tanks on numerous occasions. Every time, it obeyed our command and did not attack them.\" \"That is good to hear. And it is strong? It can withstand any attack the capitalists in the south and their Imperialist American allies can launch against it?\" \"We have shot at it with tanks, artillery, missiles, and even detonated several 250-kilogram bombs around it. It emerged unscathed.\" \"And its control device?\" \"We have it implanted deep in the ear canal. It is as well protected as can be.\" The Great Leader barked out a laugh. \"Good. Good. Then the invasion shall go forth as planned. My father's dream shall finally be realized. Korea will be united. I will even go beyond my father's dream. We shall decimate Japan, make them pay for all the atrocities they visited upon us. Then we shall go across the Pacific and turn America into ash and rubble. It will be the dawn of a new Korean Empire, an empire none shall challenge.\" Barznav glanced behind him. \"The Midget\" smiled and puffed out his chest. \"Two weeks, Doctor. In two weeks, we shall change the world.\" He nodded without a word. \"The Midget\" could change the world all he wanted. Barznav didn't care. He just wanted to show everyone that he, the son of a minor government functionary from Latvia, could achieve what most would consider impossible. XXXXX Jim Rice spun in all directions. Darkness surrounded him. His breathing increased, as did his heartbeat. He had to find a way out. A light caught his eye. He snapped his head to the right. The glow faded. He thought it looked like a teardrop, but he couldn't be sure. More flashes erupted around him. Not flashes. Fire. Gigantic balls of fire. Rice held his breath, praying none of the fireballs struck him. A noise arose from somewhere. A banshee-like wail of anger, or triumph, or both. Where was it? What was it? The firestorm intensified. Rice wanted to get out of here, to – The world shook. \"Commander. Commander. Wakey-wakey time.\" Rice's eyes flickered open. A stoic, black face hovered near his. \"Uh . . . thanks, Chief.\" Senior Chief Hank Warthan nodded at him. \"The pilot just started his descent into Seoul. I figured I better start waking everyone up.\" Rice checked around the interior of the C-2 Greyhound transport plane. The rest of his SEAL team was sacked out in the rectangular, blue-padded seats. He rose to his feet and looked at his watch. Roughly 90 minutes had passed since they launched off the carrier USS George Washington. He and Senior Chief Warthan went down the aisle, slapping the other SEALs on the shoulder to wake them. \"Damn, Commander.\" A barrel-chested man with fair hair rubbed his face. \"You interrupted an awesome dream with me and Natalie Portman.\" \"At least you had a better dream than I did, Candaele,\" Rice said to the team's SAW gunner. \"What was your dream?\" The corners of Rice's mouth twisted. \"I don't know. But I know Natalie Portman wasn't in it.\" Petty Officer 2nd Class Brian Candaele chuckled as Rice headed back to his seat. The dream played in his mind over and over again. It wasn't the first time he had this strange, confusing dream. At first he tried to dismiss it. He'd never been too concerned about his dreams, or what meaning they may have. Some dreams were just so far out there who could figure out what they meant. But this recurring dream, he kept thinking about it more than usual. A couple days ago, he actually considered keeping a dream journal, like his wife Rita. Yeah, right. He could only imagine what would happen if someone got their hands on it. Probably a psych eval. Probably removal from the field. No way would he risk that. Therefore, no way would he keep a dream journal. Fifteen minutes later, the C-2's wheels thumped down on the runway of the K-16 Air Base. When the plane finally stopped, the rear ramp lowered, letting in sunlight and warm air. Rice stood back and watched his team grab their gear and walk past him. Senior Chief Warthan went by first, followed by Candaele. Next came the lanky Felix Soto, their communications and tech specialist. He was followed by the tall, lean Stuart Engle, the corpsman, and finally the team sniper Mongkut, the son of Thai immigrants. Good men, all of them. They'd already been through all kinds of crap together in Afghanistan and Somalia. The way things were going, they would likely be adding Korea to their list of battles. The thought of war on the peninsula forced thoughts of his weird-ass dreams from his mind. He had more important things to focus on. Rice picked up his gear and strode off the plane. He barely set foot off the ramp when a pair of boxy Humvees drove up to him and his team. A young South Korean soldier emerged out the driver's side of each vehicle. The one in the lead vehicle, who couldn't have been older than twenty, marched up to him and saluted. \"Lieutenant Commander Rice?\" \"That's me.\" \"I am Corporal Young-Jae. I have been ordered to transport you and your men to SOCKOR Headquarters to meet with Captain Unser.\" \"Hey, what'd ya know?\" Candaele smiled. \"We rate our own limos. I feel special.\" \"Just don't expect a fully stocked bar in the back.\" Rice turned back to Young-Jae. \"Thanks for the lift, Corporal.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" They stowed their gear in the Humvees and got in. Rice gazed out the window, taking in the skyscrapers and tightly bunched buildings that stretched for miles and miles. He bit his lip. Ten million people lived in the capital of the Republic of Korea, aka South Korea, a capital that sat little more than thirty miles from the most heavily militarized border in the world. If the crazy Umpa-Lumpa with the bad hairdo decided to send his million-man army across the Demilitarized Zone . . . Rice's stomach quivered as they crossed the Han River. He hoped this was just more bluster from the so-called Great Leader, that he wouldn't actually be stupid enough to go to war with the ROK, and by default the US. If not, he didn't even want to think of the suffering the people of this city would experience. When they reached Camp Kim across the river, their Korean drivers took them to their temporary quarters, a Quonset hut that may have been here since the 1953 cease-fire. They dropped off their gear, got back into the Humvees, and were driven to a bland beige building. The headquarters for SOCKOR, Special Operations Command, Korea. Corporal Young-Jae escorted them inside and to a conference room on the second floor. \"Captain Unser,\" Young-Jae announced. \"I have brought Lieutenant Commader Rice's SEAL team as you ordered.\" Rice looked to the head of the wooden conference table. A portly, balding man with glasses and wearing a white US Navy uniform stood behind a chair. Captain Unser, obviously. Two other people were in the room with him, both Korean, both dressed in green-black-brown Battle Dress Uniforms. One looked to be in his early forties, though trimmer than Unser. The other had a hawkish face, a firm build and hair shaved so close he could be considered bald. The guy had the air of someone who worked in the field and not behind a desk. \"Thank you, Corporal,\" said Unser. \"You may go.\" \"Sir!\" Young-Jae marched out of the room. \"Lieutenant Commander.\" Unser walked around the table and shook his hand. \"Captain Unser, head of intelligence for US Naval Forces, Korea. Pleased to meet you.\" \"Thank you, Sir.\" Rice couldn't safely say whether or not he was pleased to meet Unser. He'd always been wary of spooks. For him, they fell into three categories; the good ones, the ones too embarrassed or too prideful to admit what they didn't know, and the ones who thought they knew everything and couldn't be wrong about anything. It was that third type that tended to get SEALs killed. \"So it's Jim Rice, huh?\" Unser inquired. \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Any relation to the baseball player?\" Unser chuckled at his own joke. Rice managed not to role his eyes. Like he'd never heard that one before. \"No, Sir.\" Obviously not, since I'm white and the other Jim Rice is black. \"Both my parents are Red Sox fans, and they both loved Jim Rice back in the day.\" \"Ah.\" Unser nodded before turning to the Koreans. \"Let me introduce Commander Whan.\" He indicated to the older Korean. \"He's with the Defense Security Command.\" His hand then moved toward the hawkish Korean. \"And this is Lieutenant Myung-Dae, Naval Special Warfare Brigade. He'll be your liaison while your team is in-country, and will be accompanying you on your missions.\" Rice's jaw tightened as Myung-Dae saluted him. \"I look forward to working with you and your team, Lieutenant Commander.\" \"Mm-hmm.\" Rice returned the salute, sensing lines of annoyance etching into his face. Great. Just what I need. A new guy on the team when we're on the brink of war. Not that he had anything against the Naval Special Warfare Brigade, better known as the South Korean Navy SEALs. He'd cross-trained with plenty of them in the past. They were exceptional, tough-ass warriors. He had no problem going into battle with them. At least, the ones he knew. And he didn't know Myung-Dae. Obviously he had to be a good warrior to be a SEAL. But Rice had no clue as to the man's experience, personality, temperament, strengths and weaknesses. Had he ever been under fire? How would he react to it? Those sorts of unknowns could jeopardize the lives of every man on the team. Unser waved them to be seated. He then picked up a remote control and activated a large TV screen at the front of the room. A computer animated map of the Korean peninsula appeared. \"I'm sure you're all aware that for the past two weeks, the North Koreans have been massing troops, armor and artillery near the Demilitarized Zone. The bulk of those forces, no surprise, are concentrated here on the western part of the peninsula, within easy striking distance of Seoul. Commander Whan.\" The ROK intelligence officer rose as Unser tapped a button. The image magnified to show the shoreline from Suwan to Yonan on the other side of the DMZ. \"While our respective armies marshal along the border to counter the North,\" Whan began, \"Defense Security Command is greatly concerned about enemy commandos and spies being inserted by boat or midget submarine near along this stretch of the coast.\" He ran a finger from Seoul south to the T'aean Haean National Park. \"Any infiltrators will have easy access to Seoul, Inchon and Suwan, where they can gather intelligence or commit acts of sabotage to disrupt our national defense efforts. This must be prevented. Therefore, Lieutenant Commander Rice, your SEAL team shall be positioned here . . .\" He took the remote from Unser. Seconds later, a jagged-looking piece of the Korean coast filled the screen. At the bottom several windows appeared showing photographs of a small beachline and the shrubbery bordering it from various angles. \"Ten miles southwest of Anyang. This area is a known infiltration point for North Korean commando forces.\" \"Then why would they use it?\" Rice asked. Whan looked stunned by the question. A perplexed look came over Unser's face. \"Pardon, Commander?\" \"Well, I mean, if we know the North Koreans like to use this place to sneak into this country, don't you think they know that we know?\" Unser and Whan exchanged glances, like they didn't know what to make of it. Rice thought he saw Myung-Dae raise an eyebrow. He waited for either intelligence officer to say something. Five seconds passed. Ten seconds. Still the two remained silent. Rice groaned and continued. \"Let's assume this is the real deal and we're going to war. Recon will become all-important to the North Koreans, so will having commandos in place to ambush convoys or blow up bridges or sever lines of communication. You think they'll want to risk those guys getting captured before their army storms across the border? They'll probably look for new landing sites, places they've never used before. Hell, they probably scouted them out months ago.\" \"Not all areas of the Korean coastline are easily accessible by boat or midget submarine,\" Whan countered. \"Plus the North will want to land any infiltrators as close to Seoul as possible. This small stretch of beach is idle for that.\" \"If possible,\" Unser spoke up. \"Capture any infiltrators you come across. The information we glean from them could be invaluable should war break out.\" \"Sure, if they actually use this place to drop-off anybody.\" Unser sighed loudly. \"Commander, this is the mission that has been assigned to you by SOCKOR operations, and it is an important operation, and you will carry it out without further complaint. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Rice did nothing to hide the disdain in his tone, wondering if Unser was sharp enough to pick it up. He doubted it. The captain seemed living proof that military intelligence was indeed an oxymoron. The briefing continued, with Rice and his team learning the specs of the vessels the North normally used for infiltration missions, the small arms commonly used by their commandos and spies, and specific terrain features of their area of operations. When they were finished, Unser ordered them to get some chow and rack time. \"You'll be deploying at 2100 hours.\" The SEALs headed back outside, with Lieutenant Myung-Dae added to the group. Their ROK drivers and Humvees were waiting for them and took them to the mess hall. Since dinner wouldn't be for another few hours, all the cooks had to offer were cold sandwiches and cold French Fries. Better than nothing, Rice thought. At least they had a frozen yogurt dispenser. Even military cooks couldn't screw up frozen yogurt. Mealtime also gave them a chance to get to know Myung-Dae a little better. He hailed from Sach'on on the southern coast, had a teenage sister, and was a very good baseball player in high school, to the point professional scouts had looked at him. Myung-Dae had been a South Korean SEAL for two years. So he's not a newbie. Well, that's good. As for his experience, all he would say was he'd had some, \"interesting times.\" Rice wished Myung-Dae would give some details, but in the shadowy world of special operations, much of what they did was top secret. As they headed back to the Humvees, Myung-Dae maneuvered himself alongside Rice. \"I believe you are right.\" He turned to the Korean. \"About what?\" \"Our mission. I do not believe the North will use that beach to land infiltrators. As you said, they must know that we know about it.\" \"So what would you do, Lieutenant?\" \"Patrol a larger stretch of the coastline in vehicles, perhaps ATVs. They can go places Humvees cannot. Along with intercepting any infiltrators we may come across, we can also identify other possible landing sites the North may use.\" Rice raised his eyebrows, then nodded. \"Exactly what I would do, Lieutenant.\" \"Thank you, Sir.\" A smile flickered across Rice's mouth. Myung-Dae was sharp, no doubt about it. Maybe he would work out with his team. They boarded the Humvees and headed back to the Quonset hut. Rice stripped down to his underwear. As he laid down on his cot, he glanced down at the hook-shaped stone pendant he wore. His good luck charm. Or more accurately, the good luck charm his wife had given him the night he proposed to her. He rested his hand over it as he closed his eyes, picturing Rita with her shapely body, long, curled jet black hair, and regal Latina features. He clenched the pendant tighter, hoping that Great Leader Umpa-Lumpa came to what little senses he had and pulled back his forces. There would be no war, and he could go back to Coronado and spend some much needed time with his wife. Rice held the image of Rita's beautiful face in his mind's eye as he drifted off to sleep. He found himself walking the beach at Coronado, Rita by his side. They held hands as they continued down the surf. Then Rice stopped and got on one knee, holding up a box containing a glittering ring. Rita beamed as tears ran down her cheeks. Just as he slipped the ring on her finger, her foot twitched. She bent down and picked up a hook-shaped rook. \"That's a weird looking thing,\" he said. \"I think it's beautiful.\" Rita rolled it around in her hand as she examined it. Her gaze returned to him. \"You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make this into a necklace and give it to you. It can be your good luck charm.\" \"C'mon, hon. You know I don't believe -\" \"Jim, the minute after you propose to me, this . . . unique stone happens to wash up on the beach and we find it. There's something . . . special about it, I know it. Please.\" All he could do was smile and nod. What else could he do? The stone meant something to Rita. Besides, it would be like having a piece of her with him whenever he deployed. Suddenly the beach, and Rita, vanished, replaced by inky blackness. \"Rita?\" He jumped to his feet. \"Rita! Where are you?\" Fireballs streaked across the sky. Rice's head snapped up. Not again. A mighty roar drilled into his ears, so loud it hurt. He grimaced and sank to his knees. \"Wake up! Everyone! You must wake up!\" Rice opened his eyes and found himself back in the darkened Quonset hut. \"What the hell, man?\" Candaele groused. \"I'm trying to sleep here.\" Rice sat up in his cot and looked to the figure standing in the doorway. \"Corporal Young-Jae? What's going on?\" \"Forgive me, Sir, but you all must wake up. The North is attacking all across the Demilitarized Zone. We are at war.\" TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 2] \"Gimmie a SITREP, people.\" General Michael Taylor, commander of US Forces Korea and Combined Forces Command, finished buttoning his tunic as he strode into the Joint Operations Center. Two Green Beret bodyguards toting M-4 rifles trailed him. \"We have a massive artillery barrage all along the DMZ,\" reported Major General Suk, the head of operations for CFC. Taylor nodded, glancing around the rows of consoles and the video monitors on the wall. He caught his tall, broad-shouldered reflection in one of the screens, and studied his compact, dark face. No visible sign of worry, thank God. He couldn't afford to look scared, though inside he was. Hell, everyone was probably scared right not. If they weren't, they were damn fools. \"Any word on North Korean troop movement?\" \"No.\" Suk shook his head. \"They are staying on their side of the border, for now.\" \"That won't last long.\" \"General,\" a female US Air Force lieutenant called out from the middle row of consoles. \"Global Hawk is on station forty thousand feet above the DMZ's western sector. Feed coming in.\" \"Put it on the main screen.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" A phosphorescent green image of a large field appeared, filled with flashing white blobs. Artillery fire. A lot of artillery fire. Taylor scrunched his face and leaned forward, gazing at an area near the top of the screen. Rows and rows of squat shapes sat behind the artillery. Tanks and armored personnel carriers. Lots of tanks and armored personnel carriers. Any minute he expected those vehicles to start moving toward the DMZ, then roll the thirty or forty miles to Seoul. Taylor turned around and spotted the wiry, dark-haired figure of General Pendelli, the head of US Air Forces Korea. \"Status of North Korean air force.\" \"The AWACS shows more than one hundred-fifty enemy aircraft of all types in the air. None of them have come within twenty miles of the DMZ.\" \"Naval activity?\" \"No vessels from the North have penetrated the Republic's territorial waters,\" said Suk. \"What about acts of sabotage or assassination?\" \"I have checked with civil defense and the National Police Agency. No such incidents have been reported.\" \"And your president?\" Taylor asked Suk. \"He is currently en route to a command bunker outside the city.\" Taylor nodded slowly. Worry slithered through him. This wasn't like any scenario they had studied for how the North would invade the South. Everyone expected commando attacks across the country. Bridges and power stations and communications towers blown, political and military leaders assassinated. Mass confusion in the opening hours of the war. But that hadn't happened. Nor had any attempted aerial attacks on South Korean cities and military bases, or any shore bombardment by North Korean vessels. Taylor and his subordinates all expected the Great Leader to throw everything they had at the ROK. The North had to knock them for a loop and drive down the peninsula as quickly as possible before US reinforcements arrived from Japan and stateside. Yet for now, they seemed content to just sit back and lob shells at them. Well, if you idiots are just gonna sit there and make yourselves juicy targets, that's fine by me.\" \"All right, let's get some planes over there and knock out that artillery and armor.\" \"We have three F-16 squadrons en route to the western sector,\" Pendelli reported. \"Two ROK and one US.\" \"Good.\" Taylor nodded. \"Contact the Navy. I want Washington's F/A-18s in the air, and the cruisers, destroyers and submarines to launch cruise missiles at their designated command and control targets.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" replied a US Navy Commander at one of the consoles. \"Get the Second US Infantry Division and the ROK's Sixth Corps moving toward the DMZ. I want them in position to blunt any advance the North Koreans make.\" \"I will see to it, Sir,\" said Suk. For the next five minutes, Taylor issued one order after another while checking the monitors. Some of them showed news feeds from American and South Korean networks. Most of reporters on camera crouched in trenches while shells exploded around them. The image from the Global Hawk continued to show North Korean artillery firing while the tanks and APCs stayed put. They should be moving by now. Taylor wanted to be happy the North Koreans kept their armored forces out in the open, making them easy pickings for the approaching F-16s. But a paranoid voice whispered in the back of his head. \" They're up to something.\" But what? Why hold back? It didn't make sense. He checked all the video monitors, all the radar images from the AWACS and Joint STARS surveillance planes and enemy comm traffic intercepted by signals intelligence. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary . . . save for the fact North Korea had launched their biggest attack on their southern neighbor since the cease-fire of 1953. \"General Taylor. Time on Target for F-16s in western sector, three minutes.\" \"Thank you, General Pendelli.\" Taylor's face stiffened as he stared at the main screen, waiting for the F-16s to begin their attack, praying his paranoia was unwarranted. XXXXX \"Firebird Flight. Begin descent. Stay within assigned sectors.\" Major Mal-Chin heard a chorus of \"Yes, Sirs\" as his F-16 neared the DMZ. Fiery flashes lit the darkened horizon. Artillery fire. He couldn't help but glance out the side of his jet's teardrop canopy, thinking of the Koreans and Americans in those trenches being pounded by enemy shells. Fear not. It will stop soon. We will make sure of it. Mal-Chin and his flight rocketed over the DMZ. He activated the infra-red sensor of his LANTIRN pod, which showed a bright green image of the landscape below him. A steady beeping filled the cockpit. Mal-Chin tensed and checked his radar warning receiver. \"Active search radar! Straight Flush! Straight Flush!\" he called out the radar's NATO codename. It was probably linked to an SA-6 Gainful, an older surface-to-air missile, but no less deadly. \"Firebird Ten. Source acquired. Engaging.\" Seconds later a bright contrail tore through the night sky. A HARM anti-radar missile launched by Lieutenant Wook, who flew one of two F-16s assigned to Wild Weasel duty. In the distance, two trails of fire rose from the ground, climbing higher and higher into the night sky. \"Dump chaff!\" Mal-Chin ordered. \"Stay in formation!\" His thumb mashed down on the chaff button of his HOTAS control on the left side of the cockpit. He kept the F-16's pointy nose aimed right at the North Korean artillery and armored formation. So did the other fighters in his squadron. Mal-Chin's jaw clenched as he watched the SA-6s arc over and start toward them. His eyes flickered to the white trail left by the HARM. Hurry . . . Hurry. The contrail connected with the ground. A bright orange flash erupted He continued to dump chaff from the dispensers. Clouds of aluminum strips formed behind the F-16s. Sweat dampened his forehead as the enemy SAMs drew closer, closer . . . And shot over the squadron. With their ground radar a smoldering wreck, there was nothing to guide them. The North Koreans switched on another Straight Flush radar. Wook blasted that one to bits before any missiles could be launched. Three miles out, Mal-Chin could make out individual gun emplacements on his LANTIRN sensor. Towed artillery. No way could they escape in time. He settled his targeting pipper over a concentration of guns and thumbed the fire button. The F-16 jumped several feet as four Rockeye II cluster bombs fell away from the jet. Mal-Chin waited about ten seconds before he banked to the left. A snaking trail of explosions that resembled fireworks tore through the North Korean batteries. Thousands of pieces of armor-piercing shrapnel from the tiny bomblets would be slicing through the air, ripping apart both metal and flesh, and silencing many of the guns that threatened his fellow Koreans and their American allies. The other F-16s unloaded their Rockeyes. More explosions consumed the North Korean positions. Mal-Chin and the other pilots wheeled around, looking to engage the tanks with their Maverick missiles. \"Firebird Flight, Sunstroke Four, be advised,\" a new voice stated over his headphones. An American from the orbiting AWACS early-warning plane. \"Bandits inbound to your position. Six, repeat, six MiG-21s.\" \"Acknowledged, Sunstroke,\" Mal-Chin replied. \"Firebird Twelve through Sixteen, engage inbound MiGs.\" \"Engaging MiGs,\" replied Captain Yan in Firebird 12. \"AMRAAMs armed . . . targets locked . . . fir-\" Something flashed in the night sky. Mal-Chin's vision went white. He turned away and blinked. The radio exploded with chatter. \"What was that?\" \"I can't see!\" \"Is that a missile?\" \"Firebird Thirteen is -\" Mal-Chin blinked repeatedly. White and yellow dots danced before his eyes. He checked all around him. The bright streak was still there, cutting through the night sky. It wasn't a missile. It looked like some sort of beam. Something burst to his right. He whipped his head around. Horror stabbed his chest as he watched an F-16 fireball. Another plane exploded. Another. Another. \"Where is it coming from?\" \"Firebird Six! Firebird Six! Come in! Come in, dammit!\" \"Maintain radio discipline!\" Mal-Chin ordered. \"Drop to the deck! Drop to -\" A bright glow lit up his cockpit. He looked up. Mal-Chin felt intense heat. Then a quake. Then nothing. XXXXX \"Everybody calm down, dammit!\" Taylor bellowed. The panicked, confused voices that had echoed through the JOC faded. \"We can't afford to fall apart right now. Contact whoever you need to and find out what the hell just happened.\" He exhaled slowly, trying to push down his own swelling panic. They'd just lost an entire squadron of South Korean F-16s, and no idea how. \"We've got more planes down!\" Pendelli blurted. \"It's the American F-16s.\" \"I'm getting reports of white flashes in the sky,\" said the female lieutenant. \"Missiles?\" Taylor asked. \"I don't think so. I'm tasking the Global Hawk to investigate.\" Taylor looked up to the wall, his eyes shifting between the Global Hawk image and the radar display from the AWACS. The latter showed digital images representing US and ROK F-16s flickering and vanishing. Worry and anger smashed together inside him. They were losing their air support for the entire western sector. What the hell was going on out there? Why the hell didn't anyone here know? He fought the urge to start yelling. These were good people in the JOC. They'd get the answers, and get them soon. They'd better. A white beam flashed across the image from the Global Hawk. Taylor tilted his head. Was that a laser? The North Koreans did possess weaponized lasers designed to blind troops and scramble electronics, not to blow planes out of the sky. How the hell did they get their hands on something like that? The Global Hawk's camera zoomed in. Taylor's brow furrowed. There was some kind of shape. Something big. Something that moved. \"Oh my God,\" gasped the lieutenant. As much as he prided himself on remaining in control while everything around him went to hell, Taylor couldn't keep his jaw from dropping and his eyes from bulging. He was staring at a monster. An honest-to-God giant monster. The thing had the body of an armadillo lizard and the head of a Triceratops, only the horns jutting from its frill were longer. Shock froze him as he watched those horns glow and fire a laser beam into the air. He forced his eyes to shift toward the AWACS display. More F-16s disappeared. What is it? Where did it come from? Taylor shook his head. Get it together, dammit! \"Pendelli. Do we have any more planes headed toward the DMZ's western sector?\" \"Yes, Sir. A squadron of ROK Phantoms, loaded for ground attack.\" \"Retask those Phantoms. Tell them to engage that . . . monster. And warn them about that laser. Tell them they better attack from the rear.\" \"Yes, General.\" Taylor then turned to Suk. \"Get on the horn to our ground forces there. Tell them to hold their positions.\" He figured many of the troops along the border might be tempted to bolt at the sight of a laser-capable monster. \"The North Koreans may take advantage of this to come across the DMZ.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" A minute later, Taylor wondered if the order he gave Suk would do any good. The monster's laser cut a path of destruction along the southern side of the DMZ. His throat tightened, thinking of the hundreds of troops who'd just been incinerated. Little bulky objects streaked into view. The South Korean F-4 Phantoms. Taylor shook his head. Those damn jets are older than I am. For now, though, they were all they had to try and stop this monster. Black dots fell toward the monster. Bombs. Taylor's chest swelled with hope as white flashes appeared on and around the monster. It jerked and opened a maw filled with razor-sharp teeth. Taylor unconsciously stepped closer to the monitor. Die. Die, damn you. The monster kept stomping toward the DMZ. Tremors went through Taylor's legs. All those bombs and they didn't even scratch it. This can't be possible. The Phantoms pressed on with their attack. More bombs crashed against the monster. Contrails from missiles and unguided rockets struck its hide and exploded. It did not go down. More lasers shot from the monster's horns. Half-a-dozen Phantoms went down in less than a minute. The monster suddenly veered right and stomped parallel to the DMZ. Tiny pinpricks of light appeared around its feet. Mines detonating. It's like it's doing it on purpose. But that . . . Taylor's jaw trembled. No, it couldn't be. That was impossible. \"General Taylor,\" said Suk. \"We have a report from the Joint STARS. North Korean armored and mechanized forces in the western sector have started moving south.\" Taylor just stared at the operations chief. He tried to say something, but his brain and mouth were paralyzed by shock. He managed to tear his gaze from Suk and look up at the main wall monitor. The monster kept stomping along the DMZ, setting off the land mines buried along the southern side. Like it's creating a path for the North Koreans. \"My God, are they actually controlling it?\" Taylor spoke in a stunned whisper. \"Sir?\" He turned back to Suk. Taylor drew a breath and tightened his face. \"I know it sounds outrageous, General, but it looks like that monster's deliberately taking out our mines. The North Koreans are on the move, going toward that monster, not away from it. They saw what it can do. You'd think they'd turn tail and run back to P'yongyang as fast as possible. But they're not. We have to assume the North found someway to control it.\" Suk stared at him impassively. Did the man think he'd lost his marbles? The South Korean general chewed on his lip. He looked at the screen, then back to Taylor. \"Perhaps we should contact the Japanese. They have experience dealing with such matters.\" \"Mm.\" Taylor thought back to all the incidents that nation went through involving those man-eating bird monsters and the big-ass fire-breathing turtle. \"I'll contact their Ministry of Defense. See what they can do to help.\" He gazed back at the screen as the monster continued tramping across the DMZ, while North Korean tanks and armored vehicles drew closer to ROK territory. He prayed the Japanese had some idea to stop this creature before it, and the North Korean armed forces, laid waste to this country. TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 3] Rice clenched his teeth to the point he thought he'd crack his molars. His narrowed, burning eyes watched a slender FROG-7 artillery missile soar away from its rectangular, eight-wheeled launcher. Destination, Seoul. So far seven of the ancient Soviet-made missiles had been launched at the ROK capital. Who the hell knew what kind of warheads they had? Maybe conventional high-explosive. Maybe, God forbid, chemical. And who the hell knew where the damn F/A-18s from George Washington were to blow the crap out of these things? He glanced over at Myung-Dae, concealed in the foliage like the rest of the SEAL team. With his black camo paint, it proved difficult to see the Korean's reaction. How would you feel if these guys were lobbing missiles at Washington? He'd be pissed off. Pissed off enough to kill. Myung-Dae had to feel the same way. Another roar and whoosh grabbed Rice's attention. He watched a trail of fire rise into the sky. Another FROG-7 headed toward Seoul. He snorted in anger and glared through his night vision goggles at the rest of the valley. Hundreds of vehicles sat on or around the road. Tanks, APCs, self-propelled guns, towed artillery, transport trucks, field cars. At least there's no monster here. Rice still found it hard to believe the North Koreans actually controlled a giant, laser-armed monster. How the hell were they doing it? Where the hell had it come from? Before they headed into the field, Soto had pulled in a radio broadcast from the North, in which the monotone announcer stated, \"The capitalists in the South have suffered devastating losses at the hands of the People's Army, aided by the great creature Thulgira, who was summoned from another realm by The Highest Incarnation of Revolutionary Comradely Love, the Great Leader, who uses his divine hand to guide Thulgira in punishing the imperialists who wish to keep the Fatherland divided.\" \"Man, are people up there really swallowing this bullcrap?\" Candaele had said. \"I fear they are,\" Myung-Dae replied. \"Remember, many of the citizens in the North regard their leader as a deity.\" Candaele shook his head and turned to Warthan. \"What do you think, Senior Chief?\" \"I think a crazy person can make folks believe anything he wants, especially if he's got a million-man army backing him up.\" Such was the blunt logic of a Senior Chief Petty Officer. Thankfully, the Great Leader's \"divine hand\" had guided this Thulgira into The Yellow Sea. Good for the allied ground forces. Bad for the allied naval forces. Over the past couple of hours, Combined Forces Command had lost contact with two South Korean frigates and two patrol boats. Three guesses as to what's responsible for that, and the first two don't count. Still, with Thulgira busy paddling around The Yellow Sea, the U.S. and ROK forces had a chance to keep the North Koreans from reaching Seoul. So long as those damn Hornets show – \"Commander,\" Soto whispered, the receiver of his radio unit pressed against his ear. \"Diamondback Squadron is ten miles out. They want us to laze targets.\" \"About time.\" Rice looked to the other SEALs. \"Okay, boys. Light 'em up.\" They activated their laser designators. Rice aimed his at a FROG-7 launcher in the process of reloading. A low rumble descended from the sky. It had to be from the F/A-18 Super Hornets. Rice's face stiffened as he watched the green laser light splash off the FROG-7 launcher, visible only through his designator's viewfinder. Steady booms erupted from the North Korean mechanized division. Laser-like tracers from ZSU-23 mobile anti-aircraft guns tore through the night sky. Rice wondered if their radars picked up the incoming Super Hornets, or if they just threw up lead and hoped to get lucky. A dark object appeared in his night vision goggles. Something long and slender. It struck the launcher he'd targeted with his laser designator. A huge fireball blotted out the vehicle and missile. The thunderclap that followed shook the very air. More Paveway laser-guided bombs fell on the North Koreans. More FROG-7 launchers and command posts exploded. The roar of dozens of motors rose from the enemy division. Tanks and other vehicles started to move, trying to make themselves more difficult targets. Rice caught sight of a T-62 tank plowing into a ZIL-157 truck, practically crushing it. More vehicles collided with one another. Some resulted in nothing more serious than a fender-bender. Other crashes left trucks and APCs twisted wrecks. Rice almost wanted to laugh. The North Koreans were likely to do more damage to themselves than he and his SEALs could mete out. A few SAMs soared into the sky. Rice didn't notice anything plummeting to the ground trailing smoke and flame. He assumed none of those missiles found their marks. The last FROG-7 vanished in a fireball. Rice restrained the urge to pump his fist in elation. The FROGs may no longer be threatening the citizens of Seoul, but they, and the rest of the ROK population, were nowhere near out of the woods yet. He and the other SEALs turned their lasers on the anti-aircraft guns, SAM launchers and radar vehicles. Another rain of Paveways fell from the sky. Flashes of orange and black sprouted throughout the enemy formations. Never-ending thunderclaps permeated the air. Rice felt the vibrations going through his body. Pops and sparks erupted from burning vehicles as cannon shells and warheads cooked off. Armored and non-armored vehicles raced around the valley. Some drove into the woods, hoping to hide from the US jets. Though with those now hot engines, they couldn't hide from an infra-red sensor. Other North Korean vehicles tried to form up and make for Seoul. A few turned tail and headed north. Just as the rumbling engines of the F/A-18s faded into the distance, a new set of jet engines thundered over the valley. Rice and the SEALs aimed their lasers at the tanks and self-propelled artillery. Four ungainly, twin-tailed jets roared into view. A-10 Warthogs. Probably the ugliest planes in the world. Yet Rice would kiss the stubby snout of every one of them if they kept the North Koreans out of Seoul. Trails of flame flew from under the wings of the A-10s. Maverick missiles followed the lasers fired by the SEALs. Tanks and SPGs transformed into miniature volcanoes. Tracers from heavy machine guns reached up into the night sky. Good luck with that, Rice thought sarcastically. Even if they did manage to hit one of the A-10s, he doubted it would do much good. He'd heard stories from the First Gulf War of those planes taking dozens, even hundreds of hits and still flying. A deep growl cut through the air. Then another. Rice saw orange flashes spitting from the noses of two A-10s. GAU-8 30mm gatling guns. Hundreds of depleted-uranium slugs tore up North Korean tanks and SPGs. Sparks and flames leapt up from their turrets and hulls. \"Damn, those guns are cool.\" Candaele smiled. \"Why can't we get one of 'em?\" \"'Cause the damn thing probably weighs a few hundred pounds,\" Senior Chief Warthan retorted. \"Even Arnold Schwarzenegger couldn't lug that thing around.\" Rice smiled as another squadron of jets flew over. ROK F-4 Phantoms. They went after the APCs, tearing into them with Maverick missiles, cluster bombs and 20mm cannons. Pillars of flame, too numerous to count, stretched from one end of the valley to the other. And we're not done with you bastards yet. \"Soto. Let the groundpounders know they're up.\" \"With pleasure, Sir.\" Soto punched in the proper frequency and raised the receiver to his lips. \"Brawler, this is Venom. Brawler, Venom. Olympus. I say again, Olympus.\" The A-10s and F-4s climbed into the darkness and vanished. Rice surveyed the hellish scene in the valley below. Machine gunners continued to fire into the air. A few soldiers, officers he guessed, dashed around the burning vehicles, shouting and waving their arms, trying to restore some semblance of order. A few North Koreans crawled out of burning tanks and APCs. Some of those men were burning themselves. Rice grimaced and felt his stomach lurch. Horrible way to die. Part of him wished their vehicles had just completely blown up. It would have been quicker and spared them the agony. Medics treated the wounded, some of which were loaded into ZIL trucks and sent north, presumably to aid stations. Other soldiers guided surviving vehicles off the road and to the edges of the woods. Damn, there were still a lot of them, even after the bombing. Rice got worried when he saw tanks and APCs begin to form a perimeter. A few surviving ZSU-23s even joined them, their quad-cannon turrets swiveling back and forth, ready for another air raid. His heartbeat picked up as he swallowed. C'mon, guys. Don't let 'em get organized. \"Here they come,\" Mongkut reported in his low, steady voice. Rice looked to the south. He let out a long sigh of relief. Squat forms of M1A1 tanks and M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles barreled straight at the North Koreans. Orange plumes burst from the tanks' 120mm guns. Flames ripped through the turrets and chassis of several T-62s and Type 59s. A few others rotated their turrets toward the American armored force and fired. Rice tensed when he saw sparks and orange flashes jump off the M1A1s. Not a single one stopped. He smiled. He'd heard M1A1s were armored like a battleship. Now he believed it. More North Korean tanks exploded. Others spun around and sped north. A couple North Korean soldiers fired what looked like RPG-7s at the US tanks. Both rockets missed. Tracers flew from a Bradley's 23mm cannon in the direction of the enemy soldiers. More tanks and IFVs appeared. South Korean Type 88s and K200s. They hit the North Koreans' left flank. Rice's breathing increased as he watched enemy vehicles blow up and burn. Some North Koreans retreated. Others stood and fought. US and South Korean infantrymen dismounted from their vehicles. Tracers from small arms fire criss-crossed the battlefield. Part of him wanted to go down there and add his M-4 to the firefight. Pulling a trigger was a hell of a lot more satisfying than just sitting and watching. He closed his eyes, getting a handle on his emotions. They'd done a hell of a lot more damage with lasers and a radio than they could ever hope to do with their rifles and machine guns. Hopefully, this would stall the North Koreans' offensive. If they couldn't drive down the peninsula fast, they were – \"Oh crap,\" Soto blurted. Rice whipped his head toward him. \"What is it?\" Soto looked to him, still clutching the receiver. \"Just got word from CFC. That damn monster just came out of water. It's headed right here.\" Fear shot through Rice. His jaw stiffened as he tried to keep from shaking. An image of Thulgira's massive foot squashing them all flashed through his mind. Get it together. He drew a quick breath and motioned for Soto to give him the receiver. \"Brawler, this is Venom. Thulgira is headed your way.\" \"Say again, Venom.\" \"Thulgira, the monster. It's coming your way. It'll . . .\" A tremor rippled through the ground. Another. Another. He swore he heard their corpsman, Engle, gulp. A grinding roar carried across the air. Ice spread over Rice's body. \"Venom, this is Brawler. We are pulling back to Seoul. Repeat, we are pulling back to Seoul. Get your asses out of here.\" \"Roger that, Brawler. Venom out.\" He handed the receiver back to Soto and looked around at the other SEALs. \"Pack it in, guys. We're gettin' the hell out of Dodge.\" Another roar filled his ears, much closer. \"I think we're too late, Sir.\" Warthan looked to the west. Rice followed the Senior Chief's gaze. \"Oh my God.\" Candaele whispered and made a sign of the cross. Rice couldn't stop himself from shivering. Thulgira appeared over the trees. The damn thing had to be sixty or seventy meters tall. Its footfalls created mini-earthquakes. It roared again, making a beeline to the battlefield. \"Back! Back!\" Rice ordered. The SEALs retreated deeper into the foliage and laid on their stomachs. Rice held his breath as tremors shook every inch of his body. He gripped his M4 rifle tight, trying to keep his hands from shaking. His eyes never left the massive form of Thulgira. A collage of images whirled before his mind, images most people wouldn't believe possible in a situation like this. Rice saw himself going through the hell of BUD/S, swimming in the freezing cold Pacific Ocean, running through obstacle courses and rolling in mud pits. He thought back to all the weight-lifting and push-ups and sit-ups, all the hand-to-hand combat training, all the weapons he'd used from pistols to AT-4 rocket launchers. The Navy had spent nearly eight years turning him into one of the most elite warriors on the planet. Despite all that, Rice felt insignificant, even helpless, as he stared up at the enormous monster before him. Trees groaned and fell as Thulgira pushed through the woods. A huge reptilian foot smashed into the ground less than thirty yards from them. Rice felt his body jump off the ground. He bit his tongue, cutting off a gasp. Rita's face materialized in his mind's eye. I love you. I love you. Please, God, let me see her again. Thulgira tramped past them. Rice forced himself to inch forward and peeked between the bushes. US and South Korean tanks wheeled around and rolled back toward Seoul. Soldiers scrambled to get back into their Infantry Fighting Vehicles. A few, too scared to think straight, just ran. Thulgira's horns glowed. A beam shot out from each one, connected, and formed a single beam. It cut through the ground and into the US armored force. M1A1s burst apart like large fireworks. So did the Bradleys. Thulgira roared and brought its foot down on an M1A1. Another beam sliced into the South Korean force. More tanks, IFVs and men went up like matchsticks. Jets roared out of the sky. A-10s and F-4s. The A-10s opened up with their gatling guns. Tracers pummeled Thulgira's hide. The armor-piercing rounds didn't faze it a bit. The monster roared and fired its beam. Two A-10s exploded. An F-4 dove on Thulgira and laced it with 20mm fire. It had no effect. Before the fighter could pull up, Thulgira whirled around and lashed out its arm. The jet shattered like a vase hitting the floor. \"Dammit,\" Rice heard Myung-Dae curse. More beams devastated the retreating US and ROK forces. Rice lowered his head and felt tremors of fear race through his legs. Did they plan this? Was Thulgira being sent into the sea all a plan to lure the bulk of the CFC's armored and mechanized forces in the Seoul area here, so the damn monster could wipe them out? Well, it worked. Now nothing stood between the North Koreans and the ROK capital. Instead of following Brawler's orders, the SEALs stayed put. Hell, Brawler was probably dead anyway. They reported back to Combined Forces Command that Thulgira had routed the US/South Korean forces and was headed toward Seoul. Two hours later, they reported a Corps-sized force of North Korean armor and mechanized infantry also headed for the capital. As enemy tanks and APCs and artillery and trucks rolled past, Rice dug out his necklace from under his collar and ran his thumb along the hook-shaped stone. Rita had called this a lucky charm. He hoped his wife was right, because they needed all the luck they could get to stop Thulgira and the North Koreans. He winced, his brow furrowing. Why did the stone suddenly feel warm in his hand? XXXXX Under the Northeast Pacific Basin The feeling pulsated through it. A familiar feeling. Danger. Another threat to the world. The birds? No, not this time. Something else. Something even more dangerous than the birds. Sensations from The Link flooded it. Terror. Worry. The Link feared it would lose this battle. But something tried to push that fear aside. A determination. The Link would not quit. The Link would either win or die trying. It latched onto that feeling. Strength coursed through it. It would need all the strength it could to defeat this threat. Its strength and the strength from The Link. Its massive heart pounded. Its yellow eyes flickered open. Arms and legs slid out from its shell. It reared back its head and let out a prolonged, wailing roar. Gamera the Defender pushed off the ocean floor and headed west. TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTE: Definition of terms: FROG – Free Rocket Over Ground APC – Armored Personnel Carrier ROK – Republic of Korea, aka South Korea SAM – Surface-to-Air Missile SPG – Self-Propelled Gun IFV – Infantry Fighting Vehicle CFC – Combined Forces Command BUD/S – Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training[Chapter 4] Uldis Barznav had to admit, the image on the large wall monitor looked rather nice. The early morning sun bathed Seoul in a soft orange glow. So many tall buildings towered over the enormous city, sunlight glinting off their many glass windows. Absolutely nothing in Latvia could compare to this. A shame it wouldn't exist much longer. He tapped the keyboard in front of him, sending out the appropriate signals. Within seconds the image on the screen wobbled. Thulgira was on the move. Barznav leaned back in his chair and grinned. Barely 12 hours into the invasion and already Thulgira and the North Koreans were at the outskirts of Seoul. As though I ever had any doubts. He'd conducted so many tests and trials that he knew when the day came, there would be no problems. Seoul drew closer, broadcast by the cameras imbedded behind Thulgira's eyes. Another one of Barznav's innovations. He had hoped to have an aerial view of the attack on Seoul, courtesy of an An-24 modified for surveillance duty. But it, and its two escorting MiG-23s, had been shot down just minutes after entering the airspace of the South Korean capital. Inconvenient, but not too much of a detriment. Spies from the North had hacked into traffic and security cameras all over Seoul, or had planted cameras on top of some of the tallest buildings in the city. It gave him hundreds of vantage points to witness the attack, and all those transmissions were fed into a computer program designed to give them a digital overview of Seoul, and Thulgira's progress through it. The monster's feet crashed down on rows of apartment buildings and cheap houses as it entered the district, or gu, of Eunpyeong-gu in the northern part of the city. People abandoned their vehicles that clogged the streets. Hundreds, thousands, fled before Thulgira. A couple cameras showed men, women and children pushing and knocking down one another. Very few who fell got up again, trampled by the panicked mob. Barznav tapped his keyboard again. Lasers shot from Thulgira's horns. Explosions and flames consumed one neighborhood after another. Still no sign of the American or South Korean militaries. Would they just let Thulgira smash the capital without a fight? As though any weapons they had could stop him. Perhaps they realized that. Or perhaps they were just too scared of Thulgira after it had routed their forces in the DMZ and in the tank battle north of Seoul. The image from Thulgira turned to the right. Several black dots, Barznav counted at least thirty, approached the monster. They soon took on more distinct forms. Helicopters. Of all types. Slender American AH-64 Apaches and South Korean Huey Cobras, and short, bulbous South Korean MD 500 Defenders. No, apparently they have not learned their lesson. Orange flashes winked from the helicopters. Fiery contrails streaked over the flame-engulfed buildings of Eunpyeong-gu. Barznav stared impassively at the screen as the missiles slammed into Thulgira. It did not faze the monster at all. Barznav sent another signal to Thulgira. It turned toward the helicopters as they launched another salvo of missiles. A laser sliced through the air. Every helicopter the beam touched became like a miniature sun, burning bright and then fading. The surviving ones darted off in all directions. A handful, all South Korean, continued to fly toward Thulgira. Barznav emitted a sardonic laugh. A courageous last stand for their capital. A futile gesture, and ultimately, a fatal one. Thulgira left Eunpyeong-gu behind, the area transformed into a sea of fire. Barznav transmitted another signal to the monster, sending him southeast, toward Jongno-gu in the heart of Seoul, toward Blue House, the residence of the President of the Republic of Korea. XXXXX \"I know the streets are packed with people, but you have to funnel them to other streets.\" General Taylor's grip on the phone tightened as his frustration with the Colonel from the ROK Reserve Forces mounted. How he managed to keep from screaming at the man was beyond him. Because screaming means you've lost control. With Thulgira attacking Seoul, he couldn't afford to lose control. \"You do not understand the situation, General. There are hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of people on the streets. We must get them to safety.\" \"I do understand the situation, Colonel. Our systems here are tied in to traffic and security cameras all over Seoul. We also have a Global Hawk orbiting the city. Right now, I'm looking at every major road in Seoul packed to the gills with people and cars. I know you have an impossible situation, but I need you and the National Police to clear a path for our armored forces so they can reach Jongno-gu and Seodaemun-gu and form a defensive line to try and stop this monster.\" Taylor ran down the streets and highways he needed cleared. \"Sir, if we try to divert people, the other streets and highways will become so crowded it will halt their progress. There will be panic. People will be trampled. They may even fight the authorities. We will have massive civilian deaths.\" \"We're going to have massive civilian deaths if we don't get those tanks and self-propelled guns up to those gus . I know the risks involved, but we have no choice. Get those streets cleared, Colonel. Now!\" A pause. \"Yes, Sir.\" The Colonel's tone was better suited for a, \"Damn you, Sir.\" Taylor hung up the phone and looked at the wall monitors lining the CFC's alternate command post at Kunsan Air Base, 150 miles south of Seoul. Within minutes several of the traffic and security cameras picked up police and military reserves trying to halt fleeing civilians and divert them to other streets. Taylor's jaw clenched as he saw hundreds of people push against the authorities. The pushes became punches. Then bottles and rocks and other objects soared through the air at police and reservists. At one highway running through Jung-gu, puffs of smoke belched from M-16s as reservists fired into the crowd. Several civilians tried to flee the bullets, only to be pushed back by the ones running away from Thulgira. The reservists kept firing into the crowd. Several civilians died. Several more surged forward. A few of them had faces twisted in rage. They swarmed the reservists. Feet and fists went up and down, some of those fists clutching bottles and cell phones and anything else they could grab. Taylor hung his head. Yeah, that worked. Dammit! The Colonel had been right. Trying to clear some of the roads sparked a riot. A deadly riot. \"Our armor and artillery will never reach their positions.\" Taylor turned to Major General Suk, who stared at the monitors with a hardened gaze. He responded with a grunt. What could he say? Suk was right. Once a riot got going, it was damn hard to stop. Especially when that riot occurred in a city with ten million people running away from a monster. He looked at a security camera feed. Two M1A1 tanks sat in the middle of a street, surrounded by stopped vehicles and mobs of civilians. Other cameras broadcast similar scenes. His tanks and self-propelled artillery wouldn't be going anywhere. Unless . . . Nausea burned his stomach as the thought formed in his mind. His armored forces could reach their positions in Jongno-gu and neighboring Seodaemun-gu. What sort of obstacles were people and cars to a 60-ton tank? Can I really do it? Could he really order his tanks and SPGs to roll over civilians? We have to protect the capital. At the cost of how many hundreds or thousands crushed by tank treads? They're dead anyway if we can't stop Thulgira. And what guarantee did they have they could stop that damn monster? Missiles and bombs and shells hadn't even scratched it yet. Maybe we can slow it down enough to let the civilian population escape. Kill a few thousand to save several million. That would be a logical trade-off. Could he live with that kind of logic? What about the crews of those tanks and SPGs? Could they live with it? Would they even obey such an order? Taylor glanced over at Suk. What about him and all the other South Koreans here? What would they think of an American general who ordered his tanks to roll over their civilians? Would that wreck their alliance? And what about the press? All the hand-wringing the reporters and pundits and their political allies did over Abu Graib and the perceived torture at Guantanamo Bay would pale in comparison to American tanks deliberately crushing South Korean civilians. But how could he just let his tanks and SPGs not even try to stop this attack? Make a decision, Michael, and make it now. He drew a breath and opened his mouth. \"Thulgira is approaching Blue House,\" a South Korean captain announced from his console. \"AC-130 is on station, ready to attack.\" \"Have Global Hawk zoom in on that area. Put it up on the main screen.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The screen flickered. An overhead image of Thulgira trampling trees and smashing gardens appeared. Taylor noticed Suk's jaw quiver slightly as he watched the monster stomp toward a building with a hipped-and-gabled roof covered with blue tiles. Blue House. The ROK President wasn't there, of course. He'd long since been evacuated. Still, destroying it would be a psychological blow to the South Koreans, as destroying The White House would be for Americans. A fat, bulky four-prop plane appeared overhead. An AC-130 Spectre, the gunship version of the venerable C-130 Hercules transport. Another wall monitor showed an image from the Spectre's gun camera. \"Spectre has target lock,\" reported the South Korean captain. \"Ready to fire.\" Taylor nodded. \"Tell them to fire at will.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The image from the gun camera lit up as tracers from the 25mm gatling gun and the 40mm Bofors cannon streaked down toward Thulgira. Every few seconds the image shook as the 105mm howitzer boomed. Flashes of orange and yellow sprouted across the monster's body. The AC-130 continued to circle Thulgira, keeping up a steady stream of fire. Taylor had seen the aircraft's impressive array of weapons lay waste to enemy forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Against, Thulgira, they did nothing. The monster raised its head and fired a laser. The circling, slow-moving AC-130 made an easy target. Taylor sighed and lowered his eyes after the plane turned into a fireball. Thulgira tramped up to Blue House. Its massive foot smashed down on the building, which crumpled as though it was made of matchsticks. The other buildings of the complex met similar fates, until all that remained were piles of rubble. He heard gasps, two female, one male. All Korean. Taylor rotated his head left to right. Every South Korean soldier in the place had their eyes fixed on the screen. Some gaped at the ruin of the Blue House complex. Others, like General Suk, stood or sat in stoic silence. One or two looked as though they might cry. Taylor drew a long, deep breath. \"All right, everyone. There's nothing we can do about Blue House. But we still have the rest of Seoul to protect. General Suk.\" He turned to the CFC head of operations, his decision on their armored forces made. \"As you said, there's no way our tanks and SPGs will make it to their positions. Tell the crews to disable all sensitive equipment aboard and abandon their vehicles. If they can't make it out on foot, tell them to seek shelter in a basement.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Taylor then looked to General Pendelli. \"Looks like it's up to the air force to stop Thulgira. What's the status on the strike package?\" \"The F/A-18s from the Enterprise are almost on station.\" Enterprise was the second US carrier operating in the Korean Theater of Operations, specifically in the Sea of Japan. \"Alpha Strike should commence in five minutes.\" \"Thank you, General.\" Taylor nodded and looked at another screen, this one showing the radar feed from a South Korean 737 AEW&C.; Over seventy planes of all types were gathering around the South Korean capital. American F-16s, F/A-18s and A-10s, ROK F-15s, F-16s, F-4s and F-5s. All preparing to hit Thulgira from every point on the compass. He watched a group of electronic blips nearing Seoul. F/A-18 Hornets from the Enterprise. His eyes then shifted to the view from the Global Hawk. Another laser cut through the air. Skyscrapers exploded in half, their tops tumbling to the ground. Great gray clouds of debris rolled over smaller buildings. Taylor barely suppressed a shiver. Nine-Eleven flashed through his mind. Nine-Eleven magnified by a factor of thirty. Come on, damn you, he mentally cursed the jets. Hurry the hell up! Once the Hornets reached their station, all the jets in the strike package climbed higher. Another laser blast from Thulgira set several blocks of Seoul afire. Huge clouds of smoke and dust billowed up from the ground. Before long, Taylor had a hard time seeing Thulgira. And if I can't see him . . . The US and ROK jets nosed over and dove on the monster. Their radio transmissions came through the speakers in the JOC. \"I don't have a visual on the target.\" \"Too much smoke. I can't see.\" \"I've got a radar return on something big. It's gotta be the monster.\" \"I can't get a laser lock with all that smoke.\" Someone from the South Korean 737 AEW&C; rattled off GPS coordinates. \"Got it!\" \"Fire!\" \"Fire!\" \"Bombs away!\" Taylor noticed everyone's attention turn to the main screen. A few surviving buildings could be seen through breaks in the clouds of smoke and dust. Suddenly the clouds vanished. A digital image of Thulgira appeared, stomping through one neighborhood after another as it neared the Han River. Must be the Global Hawk's Synthetic Aperture Radar. Those things could see through the thickest of clouds. Trails of flame tore through the smoke and dust. So did several dark, oblong shapes. Missiles and bombs. The Global Hawk's SAR showed some of the projectiles missing badly, by as much as a mile or more. Smart weapons don't necessarily mean perfect weapons. Other bombs and missiles exploded near Thulgira. A few hit dead on. Taylor held his breath and took a couple steps toward the monitor. Other soldiers and airmen manning the consoles leaned forward as the SAR image showed Thulgira stumble and flail. Go down. Go down and stay down, dammit. A second wave of fighters and attack jets dove on Thulgira. Dozens of contrails and dozens of bombs converged on the monster's position. Some missed, those misses ranging from a few feet to a mile-and-a-half. Others scored direct hits. Thulgira leaned to one side and fell. A smattering of cheers went through the JOC. Others shot out of their seats, looking ready to cheer. Taylor tensed, his eyes locked on the screen. One second passed. Thulgira did not move. Two seconds passed. Still it didn't move. Three seconds . . . four . . . five . . . The SAR picked up movement. Not much at first. Soon Thulgira pushed itself off the ground and was back on its feet. \"No,\" came a fearful whisper from a female Korean lieutenant. Lasers shot from Thulgira's horns and into the air. The beam moved back and forth. Taylor glanced at the feed from the 737 AEW&C.; One dot vanished. Then another and another. The beast had to be firing blind through the smoke and the dust. But with so many planes in the air, Thulgira was bound to hit some of them. The monster turned its lasers back to ground targets. Bridges spanning the Han River, bridges packed with people, exploded into nothingness. More skyscrapers were cut in half, huge chunks of debris tumbling to the ground. Flames swept through one gu after another. A heavy silence hung over the JOC. Taylor looked around. Several Americans and Koreans hung their heads, Suk included. Taylor clenched his jaw, trying not to hang his head. Even now, he had to appear confident in front of the men and women he led. Not that he felt confident, not after they threw everything they had at Thulgira to no avail. He walked over to one of the communications consoles and picked up a red phone. He heard the dial tone the moment he held it to his ear. The phone was connected to just one person in the entire world. The President of the Republic of Korea. \"Mister President, this is General Taylor. I regret to inform you that Seoul has fallen.\" XXXXX Soldiers, scientists and technicians alike cheered and shook hands as the few surviving cameras in Seoul showed the great city awash in fire. \"You have succeeded, Doctor Barznav,\" Major General Sang told him. \"Seoul has been destroyed. The capitalists in the South will be utterly demoralized. They have nothing that can stop Thulgira. It will not be long before the capitalist oppressors are defeated and The Fatherland is reunited. Your service to the Great Leader shall be rewarded.\" \"Mm-hmm.\" Barznav simply nodded and continued looking at the burning city. The Great Leader reward him? With what? A paltry few million dollars. The Midget had a bank account worth billions. His eyes shifted from the monitors to the keyboard that controlled Thulgira, then back to the monitors. He thought about some of the propaganda broadcasts he'd heard, the ones that claimed The Midget actually controlled Thulgira. That idiot couldn't use a DVD player without help. He controlled Thulgira. Him and him alone. And if he controlled Thulgira, what could stop him from controlling Korea? To hell with Korea. What's to stop me from controlling the world? TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTE: AEW&C; – Airborne Early Warning & Control JOC – Joint Operation Center[Chapter 5] Rice jammed the blasting cap into the block of C4 attached to one of the supports of the bridge spanning the Geum River. He scowled at it as he hung from the rope. He couldn't believe they were retreating. His superiors at Combined Forces Command could call it whatever they wanted. A tactical withdraw, regrouping, or the famous BS line \"fighting in another direction.\" It all added up to one thing. The North Koreans had them on the run. My God, he wanted to punch something. SEALS don't run. They fight! To the last man, if necessary. At least, they could do that against a normal enemy. Thulgira did not count as a normal enemy. Instead, his SEAL unit had been tasked with blowing this bridge to delay the advancing North Koreans and give US and South Korean forces time to set up a defensive line at Daejon to the south. At least blowing the bridge would slow the North Koreans. It sure as hell wouldn't slow Thulgira. Rice inserted the last blasting cap and looked up. \"I'm done, Candaele. Bring me up.\" The SAW gunner pulled him up to the bridge. Once Rice untied the rope around him, he checked around. Forests stretched for miles on both banks. No sign of any bad guys, or monsters. \"SITREP,\" he spoke into his throat mike. \"One more support to go,\" reported Senior Chief Warthan. \"Lieutenant Myung-Dae and Engle are about to get started on it.\" \"Roger that. Stay alert.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"I'm wondering why we're even botherin' doin' this,\" Candaele groused. \"Hell, that friggin' monster doesn't need a bridge. He could just wade across this damn river.\" \"We're doing this to slow down the North Korean Army,\" Rice replied. \"Like they really care if they get delayed by a few hours. Thulgira's winning this war for them single-handedly.\" Rice let out a frustrated breath. \"I wish I could argue with you, Candaele. But all I can say is orders are orders. SOCKOR wants us to blow this bridge, so we blow this bridge.\" \"Yes, Sir. Just voicing my opinion.\" \"You've been in the Navy long enough to know you're not allowed to have an opinion.\" Rice tacked on a smile. Candaele smiled back. \"Echo Six, Echo One,\" Rice heard Mongkut's voice in his earpiece. \"Echo Six. Go.\" \"We've got company,\" said the sniper, who sat on a hilltop some 700 yards from the bridge. \"Two M-113 APCs. Approaching the bridge from the north. Two miles out.\" \"Roger.\" Rice chewed on his lower lip. The South Koreans used M-113s. But all allied forces should already be on the other side of the Geum by now. Probably stragglers. Still . . . \"Okay, everyone. You heard Mongkut. We've got APCs coming our way. Get into the bushes now.\" Good guys or not, if someone was coming their way they had to turn invisible. Outsiders might think it made no sense to hide from your allies. But what if those soldiers told others they had seen SEALs setting charges to this bridge and it somehow got back to the North Koreans. Rice and his men operated in a world where secrecy meant the difference between life and death. His SEALs coiled up their ropes and hustled across the bridge. He stood on the roadside until each of his men had gone into the nearby shrubbery, then joined them. A minute later, they heard the growling of diesel engines. Soon a pair of dark green shoebox-shaped tracked vehicles appeared. M-113s, Vietnam War-era armored personnel carriers. As with the US Army and Marine Corps, the South Koreans had pretty much withdrawn them from regular front-line units. These two probably belonged to a reserve unit. The M-113s rolled onto the bridge. Rice exhaled slowly, wishing the vehicles would hurry up and get across. He wanted to finish setting the last charges and . . . Both M-113s stopped side-by-side at the center of the bridge. Soto's face scrunched up. \"Why the heck did they stop?\" \"I don't know.\" Rice shook his head. It didn't make sense. They were a force in retreat. These guys shouldn't want to stop until they reached Daejon. The rear ramps of both M-113s lowered. Soldiers in green-brown-black Woodland Battle Dress Uniforms rushed out, M-16 rifles at the ready. One soldier in each vehicle manned the pintel-mounted .50 caliber machine gun. Rice tensed as he watched the Koreans. Something didn't feel right. One soldier, a stocky, pug-faced man, waved his arms and shouted orders. Three soldiers hurried to the northern end of the bridge, and three more to the southern end. Sentries. Pug-face shouted something else and gestured to the other soldiers. \"He's telling them to check the supports,\" Lieutenant Myung-Dae told Rice and the other SEALs. \"What'd ya mean 'check the supports'?\" Candaele asked. \"What the hell for?\" Myung-Dae ignored him and turned to Rice. \"Commander Rice. Those men are not South Korean soldiers. They are North Korean. I believe Special Purpose Forces.\" \"You sure?\" \"I do not see how they can be anything else. A regular or reserve infantry unit would continue their retreat, not stop on the middle of a bridge.\" Rice continued to stare at him. Everything Myung-Dae said made sense. Hell, he'd had the same thoughts. Being a potential adversary, him and his fellow SEALs had studied everything available to them about the North Korean Special Purpose Forces. They did possess many types of uniforms, weapons and equipment used by the South Korean military in order to conduct behind-the-lines operations. This was likely one of them. The North Koreans weren't stupid, especially the SPF. They had to know it would make sense for the retreating US/ROK forces to blow this bridge. Therefore, their objective would be to neutralize any explosives they found and secure the bridge for any approaching North Korean army units. What if you're wrong? Rice tried to push down the little voice in the back of his head. He couldn't be wrong. It was the only thing that made sense. But what if these guys were South Koreans? What if they were acting on some other general's orders to secure the bridge, even though SOCKOR had ordered it demolished? It wouldn't be the first time one command didn't know what another was up to, especially with all the chaos and confusion of the retreat. Rice gritted his teeth. What if he and Myung-Dae were wrong? What if he ordered them to attack a bunch of South Korean soldiers? He couldn't even imagine the crap storm this sort of friendly fire incident would create. Pug-face hollered and gestured again. \"He's telling them to get ropes and check the supports,\" Myung-Dae translated. Rice narrowed his eyes at the Koreans on the bridge. This was not the way a regular, or especially a reserve infantry force, acted. What if you're – No! He wasn't wrong. He had to erase all doubt from his mind. SOCKOR had given him and his unit a mission. They would complete it. That was all that mattered. \"Echo One, Echo Six.\" \"Echo Six,\" Mongkut replied. \"Go.\" \"One, the soldiers on the bridge are not, repeat, not South Korean. High probability they are North Korean Special Purpose Forces here to secure this bridge.\" \"Copy that.\" \"You see the stocky soldier shouting and gesturing in all directions?\" A pause. \"I see him.\" \"I'm guessing he's the leader. When I give the word, you take him down.\" \"Copy that.\" \"Six out.\" Rice turned to the rest of his men. \"All right. Engle. AT-4 on those APCs.\" \"Roger.\" Engle unslung the rocket launcher from his shoulder. \"Senior Chief.\" Rice glanced at the grenade launcher under the barrel of the M4 held by his number two man. \"Put down frag grenades on the troops around the middle of the bridge.\" \"You got it.\" \"Candaele. You lay down cover fire.\" \"The ground's too flat here. I'm not gonna have a good angle at most of the soldiers. Hang on.\" Candaele checked the area from their concealed position, keeping his movements slow and purposeful, and staying out of sight. \"Sir.\" He pointed to his right. \"Ten yards that way, there's a small tree. I can balance my SAW on one of the branches. That should give me a good field of fire.\" \"Good.\" Rice nodded. \"All right, me, Soto and Myung-Dae will break cover and advance to the bridge at a right angle, three meter intervals. We take out the sentries at the edge of the bridge, then we pop anyone left standing. Every got their assignments?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" The SEALs whispered. \"All right. Remember, these guys are the best the other side has. We gotta take 'em down hard and fast before they have a chance to get their crap together. Now let's get ready.\" Rice moved closer to the roadway, followed by Soto and Myung-Dae. Candaele crept through the bushes until he reached the tree. Engle had his AT-4 on his shoulder and Warthan chambered a frag grenade into his launcher. Everyone touched in they were ready. Not a moment too soon. The disguised North Koreans had secured a rope to the side of the bridge and lowered a commando down along the support beam. \"Echo One, Echo Six.\" \"Echo One. Go.\" \"Status on the target.\" \"I have a solution,\" Mongkut reported. \"Take him out.\" \"Copy that.\" One second passed. Then two. A muffled thump carried over the trees and water. At the same instant, Pug-face's head exploded in a cloud of red. Blood and brains spattered the metal works of the bridge, as well as a pair of North Koreans. Pug-face's headless body stumbled forward and pitched over the bridge. The other SPF troopers gawked at the sight. Even the most highly-trained of soldiers needed a couple seconds to process a sudden attack. Those couple seconds would prove fatal. A thump and whoosh erupted from Engle's AT-4. A contrail raced toward the bridge and struck the M-113 sitting in the left lane. A gusher of flame ripped through the vehicle. The explosion muffled the thump of Senior Chief Warthan's grenade launcher and the crackle of Candaele's M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. A shower of sparks went up among a group of three North Koreans. They all fell to the ground. Tracers from Candaele's SAW stitched the commando dangling next to the support, then moved up to the bridge and cut down three of his buddies. Rice, Soto and Myung-Dae broke cover. They brought up their M4s. Each fired a three-round burst. All three sentries at the edge of the bridge crumpled to the ground. A second contrail flew over the bridge. The remaining M-113 exploded. A pair of North Koreans got on their stomachs and fired in the direction of Rice and his squad. They dropped along the side of the bridge, rounds cracking over their heads. Warthan launched another frag grenade. It burst between the two North Koreans. They both rolled on their backs and lay motionless. \"Go! Go! Go!\" Rice led Soto and Myung-Dae onto the bridge. He swept his rifle back and forth, searching for targets. Fifteen yards away, he spotted a North Korean lying on his side, blood pouring from his stomach and leg. The commando reached out for his fallen M-16, dragging it toward him by the strap. Rice split the North Korean's head open with a three-round burst. The stench of burning metal and flesh from the fiery M-113s filled his nose. He ignored it, covering Myung-Dae as he used his combat knife to cut the thick nylon rope tied to the North Korean dangling next to the support. They had no idea if Candaele's rounds killed the man or wounded him. Within seconds, the severed rope zipped over the side, dropping the commando into the Geum River sixty feet below. The three SEALS moved around the flaming M-113s, searching for any more targets. Every North Korean they came across lay on the ground in pools of blood. \"Clear!\" Rice shouted. \"Clear!\" called out Soto, then Myung-Dae. \"Echo Six,\" Rice spoke into his mike. \"Bridge secure, all hostiles down. Repeat, bridge secure. All hostiles down.\" A chorus of \"Rogers\" filled his earpiece. He then called for Warthan, Candaele and Engle to return to the bridge. They quickly searched the dead North Koreans, but found nothing useful on them. Everything they wore, right down to their underwear and socks, were standard-issue ROK military. Even their wristwatches were of South Korean manufacture. Then again, for the kinds of missions the SPF did, they had to get every single detail right. Not to do so could mean death. \"Soto. Lower the Senior Chief down to the middle support. Let's make sure that one asshole didn't mess up our charges.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" Soto replied. \"Myung-Dae, Engle. Get the charges set on the last support, and make it quick. If these guys came here to secure this bridge, we could have a whole North Korean mechanized division headed our way.\" They both acknowledged the order. A few minutes later, Soto hauled up Warthan, who reported, \"Charges are fine, Sir. Our friend didn't have a chance to disarm 'em.\" \"Good to hear. Thanks, Senior Chief.\" \"Echo Six, Echo One,\" Mongkut radioed. \"Echo Six. Go.\" \"Sir, if you're not finished with those last charges, you better hurry.\" Rice grunted. \"More bad guys?\" \"Just one. The big bad guy.\" Rice froze. Fear clenched his chest. A grinding roar bellowed in the distance. \"Aw crap!\" Candaele blurted. \"Not that damn thing again.\" \"Afraid so,\" Rice grumbled before radioing Mongkut. \"Echo One. How far out is Thulgira?\" \"Six miles, at least.\" \"Engle.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"How are you coming with those charges?\" \"I still have one more to go.\" Another roar carried through the air. With those big strides of his, Thulgira could probably cover six miles in less than ten minutes. \"Engle, you've got three minutes.\" \"Roger.\" Rice fought to keep his face rigid. Not the easiest thing to do, especially every time Thulgira roared, and every time Mongkut called out its distance. Five miles . . . four miles. Crap, less than ten minutes, he had guessed? Try closer to five minutes. \"Engle?\" \"The last cap's in, Sir. Lieutenant! Pull me up and let's get the hell out of Dodge.\" Myung-Dae hauled Engle back up to the bridge. \"Let's go!\" Rice waved to them. \"Move it! Move it!\" He watched the SEALs run past him before taking off himself. Another roar split the air, much louder this time. He glanced over his shoulder. No sign of Thulgira. Yet. He pumped his legs furiously, ignoring the burning in his lungs. The monster roared again. His vision blurred. He stumbled. Was that the sky rushing before his eyes? \"Sir? You okay?\" Rice shook his head. Candaele stood fifteen feet away from him. What the hell was that about? Another roar. No time to think about it. Rice took off and caught up with the rest of the SEALs. They darted off the bridge and into the foliage along the roadway. Another flash of sky whipped before his eyes. The skin over his heart felt warm. What the hell? Forget about it. \"Soto. Detonator.\" The lanky SEAL pulled out a stubby device from his pack. \"Got it.\" A roar shook the air, making all the SEALs cringe. Thulgira's head could be seen above the treetops on the opposite bank. Rice looked to Soto and started to open his mouth. The SEALs and the vegetation around him vanished, replaced by blue sky. Wind pelted his face, to the point he feared it would rip off his skin. What the hell is happening? \"Commander?\" A distant voice called to him. \"Commander? Is something wrong?\" Rice blinked. He stared into the concerned face of Lieutenant Myung-Dae. All his SEALs stared at him with concerned expressions. Concerned and confused. He sucked down a deep breath and checked over his shoulder. Trees collapsed under Thulgira's feet as he neared the Geum River. Rice whipped his head back to Soto. \"Blow the damn bridge!\" Soto nodded, then flipped a switch on the detonator. \"Armed . . . Fire in the hole.\" His thumb came down on the red button. Flashes of orange and black erupted under the bridge, immediately followed by a string of sharp crashes. The span rocked and twisted and groaned. Thulgira paused, staring at the bridge as large pieces of it broke off and plunged into the water. \"Let's get -\" A roar filled his ears. Not Thulgira's roar. This one felt like someone stuck him inside the engine of a 747. Again he saw the sky, and something else. Something dark in front of him. No, not in front of him. Below him. He felt himself go into a dive. The dark shapes in front of him took form. Rice made out miles of trees, with a river snaking through them. Wait a minute. Is that – His chest burned. \"Ah! Shit!\" He dug under his collar and yanked out his pendant. The hook-shaped stone glowed bright red. \"Yo, what's up with that?\" Candaele gazed at it with wide eyes. \"Sir,\" said Warthan, who couldn't take his eyes off the stone. \"We need to get out of here.\" \"No. Everything'll be all right.\" \"What?\" Candaele tilted his head. \"How -\" A prolonged, wailing roar came from the sky. Rice looked up. So did the other SEALs. An oblong shape dove for the ground, flames gushing from its rear. \"No friggin' way,\" Candaele blurted. Thulgira rose his head . . . Just as Gamera plowed into him. TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTE: SITREP – Situation Report SOCKOR – Special Operations Command Korea APC – Armored Personnel Carrier SFP – Special Purpose Forces ROK – Republic of Korea (South Korea) SAW – Squad Automatic Weapon (light machine gun)[Chapter 6] \"What!\" Barznav jumped out of his seat, wide eyes glued to the screen. He was vaguely aware of Major General Sang and the other Koreans in the command center also gazing at the screen in shock. The cameras behind Thulgira's eyes pointed straight up into the sky. A dark shape hovered above it, one with a diamond-like head, rows of razor-sharp teeth and two tusks protruding from its lower jaw. Gamera. The monster turtle. Where the hell did it come from? No one had seen Gamera since it defeated the Gyaos invasion of Japan two years ago. Why did the damn thing choose now to return? Why come to Korea? Did it somehow sense Thulgira's presence? \"Gamera,\" Sang said in nearly a whisper. He turned to Barznav. \"Can . . . Can Thulgira stop him?\" Barznav whipped his head toward the General. Images spooled through his mind of the TV footage of Gamera's battles with the giant reptilian birds, all of which ended in the turtle's favor. Would the same happen here? No. \"No!\" Barznav dropped back into his seat, his fingers pounding the keyboard, sending commands to his monster. \"Thulgira will not be defeated.\" He looked up at the screen. Gamera slashed at Thulgira with its taloned hand. He can't be defeated. XXXXX Block . . . Block . . . Tackle! Rice watched Gamera lower his head and run into Thulgira. The dinosaur-like monster tumbled backwards and crashed into the opposite bank of the Geum River. Tremors raced through the ground. Now Rice stared down at Thulgira. Moments later he watched the two monsters from his vantage point across the river. The switching points of view continued as Gamera delivered a blow to the side of Thulgira's head. It was like constantly flipping back-and-forth between TV channels. Kick him! Keep him down! Gamera landed a kick into Thulgira's side. The monster roared in pain. How was he doing it? How the hell was he controlling one of the most powerful forces on Earth? Rice clenched the glowing stone pendant between his thumb and index finger. Thulgira thrashed and rammed a forearm into Gamera's midsection. The turtle stumbled backwards. Rice grimaced, pain hammering his gut. Thulgira got back to its feet and lowered its head. Lasers! Gamera ducked. A bright yellow beam shot from Thulgira's horns. It struck the top of Gamera's shell and deflected toward the sky. The turtle roared, more from anger than pain. \"Commander!\" Senior Chief Warthan hollered. \"Commander, what the hell's going on?\" \"I'm controlling him.\" Rice made Gamera leap at Thulgira. The turtle collided with the other monster. Both fell into the river, sending great sheets of water cascading over both banks. \"Say what?\" Candaele blurted. \"I'm in its head. I'm in Gamera's head. I don't know how, but I am.\" His elbows tingled. His arms tensed. Bone blades slid out the back of Gamera's elbows. Rice drew back his left arm, then delivered an elbow strike to the air. Gamera's elbow struck the frill over Thulgira's head. The blade dug into the monster's toughened skin. Gamera hit it again and again, as Rice made elbow strike after elbow strike. \"Damn, he is controlling that big turtle,\" muttered Soto. \"Yeah! Kick that ugly thing's ass, Sir!\" Candaele cheered. \"Shut up, both of you!\" snapped Warthan. \"Let the man concentrate.\" He added under his breath, \"I don't believe this shit.\" The bone blade finally pierced Thulgira's skin. Red blood flowed onto its left horn and over its snout. Thulgira roared and slammed both hands into Gamera's chest. The turtle wailed and stumbled back. Thulgira rose, lowered its head and charged. Twist to the side. Gamera turned to the ride at the last second. Thulgira stormed past, its footfalls shaking the earth. Gamera grabbed Thulgira by the back, spun it around in a complete 180 and flung it into the opposite bank. A deep rumble filled the air. Huge chunks of dirt and rock from the cliffside collapsed into the water. Stay on him. Gamera stomped over and pounded Thulgira's back. The monster spun around and swatted Gamera's head. Rice's head snapped around. Pain exploded in his skull. \"Commander!\" Myung-Dae blurted. \"I'm fine.\" Rice ignored the throbbing in his head, concentrating on the fight. Gotta kill it. Kill Thulgira, we win this war. Thulgira planted a shoulder into Gamera. The turtle roared and fell backwards. Thulgira lowered its head. Gamera opened his maw wide. Rice's throat burned as a fireball flew from Gamera's mouth. Thulgira ducked to the right. The great ball of flame shot past the monster, glancing its shoulder. Thulgira cried out in pain, smoke rising from patches of blackened skin. Gamera drew his legs into its shell. Huge jets of flame gushed from the openings and washed over Thulgira. The monster threw back its head and unleashed a piercing shriek. Rice noticed Candaele and Engle grimacing. The jets of flames from Gamera vanished. His legs slid out and he rose to his feet, letting out a prolonged, wailing roar. Thulgira stumbled in the water. Finish him. A red glow built up in Gamera's mouth. Rice drew a breath and held it. His entire body tensed. This was it. Gamera started forward, ready to unleash the fireball. Thulgira fired its laser. The beam missed Gamera and sliced into the bank. The giant turtle jerked to the right as it belched out the fireball. The deadly red-orange comet streaked past Thulgira and exploded against the opposite bank. Waves of fire swept over the forest. Thulgira fired again. The beam missed Gamera by a few yards. Another beam leapt from Thulgira's horns. This one cut into the turtle's side. Gamera wailed. Rice cried out and clutched his left side. He froze. It felt wet and sticky. \"Sir!\" Engle started toward him. \"I'm fine,\" he said through clenched teeth. \"I'm fine.\" Fight the pain. Fight it! Kill Thulgira. Gamera growled and took a shaky step toward the monster. Another step. Another. Thulgira lowered its head and charged. Move! Gamera turned to the side. Thulgira missed with his left horn. His right horn buried itself in Gamera's ribcage. XXXXX Cheers and applause rang out in the command center. Even the normally reserved Major General Sang added his voice to the mini-celebration. Barznav neither cheered nor applauded. He just slumped in his seat, letting out a long, relieved breath, hoping no one noticed it. Thulgira withdrew its horn from Gamera. The giant turtle wobbled from side to side, blood pouring out of its massive wound. It turned and stumbled along the Geum River, trying to get away. Barznav transmitted a command to Thulgira. It fired its laser. The beam struck Gamera's rigid shell, with no visible effect. A second shot yielded the same result. Gamera activated the jets in its legs and flew into the sky. Thulgira fired at the turtle again, missing. Barznav balled his fist, stopping short of thumping it on his console. Dammit. I should have killed it. He took a couple deep breaths, calming himself. Who's to say Gamera wouldn't die? Maybe it was flying off to find somewhere quiet to spend its few remaining hours on Earth. Either way, he and Thulgira had driven off the damn turtle. Barznav had to view this as a triumph. True, Thulgira had been injured. That still shocked him. But according to the sensors he had embedded inside the monster, the wound was not serious. In the end, Thulgira had defeated the world's most powerful monster. \"Did you see the imperialists' turtle flee?\" said a beaming technician. \"It cannot match Thulgira's power.\" \"Yes, Comrade,\" responded a young lieutenant at a console in the row behind Barznav. \"The Great Leader's monster is truly unbeatable.\" Barznav whipped around and glared at the lieutenant. The Great Leader's monster? What the hell did The Midget have to do with this? That idiot didn't create the technology that controlled Thulgira. He didn't study this creature. He didn't conduct tests to determine its power and resistance to injury. I did all that. Barznav turned back to the screen, the scowl on his face deepening. The time was almost at hand to show the North Koreans who truly controlled Thulgira. The North Koreans, and the rest of the world. XXXXX \"Sir? Oh my God, Jim!\" Rice barely heard Warthan, barely registered Thulgira plodding off down the Geum River. His entire body had gone ice cold. His breaths came in gurgling wheezes. Slowly, he forced his head down. Fear consumed his soul when he saw the hole in his ribcage, and the blood pouring out of it. I . . . failed. His wife's face appeared in his mind's eye. Rita. I . . . I . . . Rice fell backwards as darkness swallowed him. TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 7] General Taylor's stomach twisted as stared at his laptop on the desk of his office, his – what was it? – the fourth or fifth different office he'd had since the North Koreans crossed the 38th Parallel. A map of the peninsula appeared on the screen. The areas shaded in red denoted the parts of South Korea currently under enemy control. Half the damn country was shaded red. We're failing. I'm failing. Even worse was how his failure translated back home. The press relentlessly pounded The President, his administration, and the military about American casualties in the thousands, about one retreat after another, and about who to blame for not finding out the North Koreans had a monster. Each day, more of the public demanded US troops be brought home, that the defense of a small country an ocean away wasn't worth any more American blood. What then? We just let the North Koreans burn this country to the ground? Let them slaughter millions? Anger lines dug into Taylor's face. What the hell happened to his country? Things get tough and what does everyone want to do? Quit. Just let the bullies run the world. Let them destroy a strong democratic ally, a major trading partner with the US. And lots and lots of good people. Korea had become more than just Taylor's current assignment. Many of the South Koreans he worked with were more than colleagues. He counted them as friends. He'd be damned if he'd run out on his friends just because things got tough. He'd be damned if he'd see America run away from a fight. That had happened too much for his taste. They had run away in Vietnam. They had run away in Beirut. They had run away in Somalia. What enemy would take the US seriously if they ran away in Korea? A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. \"Come in.\" The door opened. A short Asian woman in her early forties wearing a tan-gray-green pixel pattern USAF Airman Battle Uniform entered. \"General Li,\" Taylor greeted the daughter of Chinese immigrants who served as the head of intelligence for Combined Forces Command. \"General Taylor. I hope I'm not interrupting, but I have some critical information regarding Thulgira.\" Taylor's eyes widened. He leaned forward in his seat. \"If you have something that can help us stop that damn monster, trust me, you're not interrupting.\" He motioned her to a seat in front of his desk. \"So what do you have?\" Li made her presentation. When she finished, Taylor got on the secure phone and ordered his chief of staff to arrange a meeting of the entire CFC command staff in fifteen minutes. He then exited his office, with Li on his heels, and strode through Administration Building to an elevator. He hit the button for sub-level three, and the Alternate CFC Joint Operations Center under Kunsan Air Base. Several American and South Korean senior officers, all wearing combat fatigues, sat at the long oak conference table. Other officers appeared on a large plasma screen on the other end of the room. Taylor couldn't risk having his entire staff in one place, where a single North Korean bomb could decapitate the leadership of Combined Forces Command. Once Taylor was certain everyone was present, he turned the briefing over to General Li. \"One of the things the C-2 staff,\" she used the term for Combined Forces Command Intelligence, \"has been trying to determine is how the North Koreans are controlling Thulgira. We knew there had to be some sort of signal involved, but finding it through all the radio and radar traffic around the peninsula has not been easy. But a few hours ago, we caught a break. A US RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance plane picked up an extremely low frequency signal and tracked it to a spot approximately twenty miles west of Taejon. At the time of interception, that was exactly where Thulgira was located.\" \"Do you believe this is the signal controlling the monster?\" asked Major General Suk. \"That's the only conclusion we can draw.\" \"Did you learn where the signal is originating from?\" \"Yes, General.\" Li picked up a remote control and split the plasma screen. One side contained the images of the CFC staff located elsewhere in the Korean Theater of Operations. The other side showed a map of North Korea. Using the cursor, Li highlighted a section roughly thirty miles north of the DMZ. \"Right here, at the southern tip of the Ahobiryong Mountain Range near Kaesong.\" Li changed the image again. This one showed an overhead view of a complex with several rectangular buildings, large antennas and satellite dishes. \"This image comes from one of our KH-12 satellites. Originally, we thought this was a television station, and was obviously put far down on our priority list. But after the Rivet Joint detected that signal, I tasked a South Korean RF-4C reconnaissance Phantom to fly over the facility.\" She put up a new image. It was still the \"television station,\" but this time three sections were circled with words next to them. \"Our analysts identified three camouflaged air defense systems around the facility. Two are SA-17 Gadfly missile launchers, and one is an S-60 anti-aircraft gun. We suspect there are more anti-air systems located there.\" \"I do not think we need any more evidence that this is indeed the installation controlling Thulgira,\" said Suk. \"We must destroy it as soon as possible.\" \"The only problem I see,\" noted the portly, balding Admiral Isaac Neeman, the commander of US Naval Forces Korea, \"is even if we knock out that signal, Thulgira will still be in Korea, and continue to threaten, and likely destroy, lives and property.\" \"But the monster will not do it at the direction of the North,\" countered Suk. \"It is also likely that without any guidance, Thulgira may simply go to the sea and swim away. It might even turn around and attack the North Koreans.\" \"If Thulgira does jump into the sea and, as you say, swim away, then it becomes a threat to the entire Pacific region, probably the world.\" \"I think it's already a threat to the world, Admiral.\" Taylor folded his hands on the table, wondering if, and when, those \"monster experts\" from Japan would come up with a way to stop Thulgira once and for all. \"But be that as it may, the only reason the North has been able to advance as far as they have is because of Thulgira. Denying them control of their most powerful asset has to be our first priority. We'll worry about killing it later.\" He frowned, thinking about the sudden appearance of Gamera the other day at the Geum River. If only that damned giant turtle had finished off Thulgira, they could start pushing back the North Koreans. But from what the SEAL team assigned to destroy the bridge in that area had said, the injury Gamera suffered could be life-threatening. Which means it falls on us and us alone to do the job. \"All right, people. Give me options. How do we take out this base?\" \"An air strike is our best option.\" No surprise, this came from US Air Force General Pendelli. \"We can use a B-2 out of Guam to launch some JASSMs at it. Those missiles have a range of two hundred-thirty miles. The bomber can be well off the coast when it launches.\" Taylor nodded, though had some concerns. With over half the allied combat aircraft in-country destroyed, The Americans and South Koreans could not guarantee air superiority over the peninsula. Despite the stealthy aspects of the B-2, and to a much lesser extent the B-1, they had already lost three of those strategic bombers. They may be able to hide from radar, but not a lucky pilot with a good Mark One Eyeball. \"How long will it take to get a B-2 here and knock out that facility?\" Pendelli bit his lip. \"From the time it takes to plan and brief for the mission, load and fuel the plane, and fly here from Guam, between eight and nine hours.\" Suk grunted. \"By that time Thulgira may have broken through our lines and be on its way here.\" He tapped the table with his index finger. \"General Suk's right,\" said Taylor. \"We need to knock out that place ASAP. Any other options closer to home?\" \"The Navy has its own cruise missiles, and stationed much closer to Korea than that B-2.\" Pendelli gave Admiral Neeman a quick glare in response for the dig at his service. Neeman continued. \"Currently the submarine Pittsburgh is operating about forty miles off the coast of Inchon. Once General Li sends them her intel, they can program their Tomahawk missiles, launch 'em, and take out that place, all within an hour, at least.\" \"Do it.\" Taylor straightened in his seat. A feeling sparked inside him, and soon grew larger and larger. A feeling he feared abandoned him since the destruction of Seoul. That feeling was hope. XXXXX Barznav took his time strolling through the complex. He looked around at the surrounding forests and mountains. The scenery didn't really captivate him. A forest was a forest and mountains were mountains to him. But it was nice to get out for a little fresh air. For two-and-a-half days he had been confined to the sub-levels. The advances south by Thulgira and the People's Army had kept him occupied most of the time. But eventually, he needed to get outside and see the sun and feel the breeze. The sun was starting to set as he approached the cluster of antennas, two soldiers acting as bodyguards in tow. He stared at the largest one, the one sending the signals that controlled Thulgira. The one that made him the most powerful man in the world. Barznav clasped his hands behind his back, mentally sifting through ideas and plots. The time was fast approaching to end his relationship with the North Koreans. But he had to get Thulgira in a position where he could kill The Midget. How many in this country looked upon that idiot as a god? Kill the god, crush their spirit. They would not dare oppose him. Or would they? What would stop General Sang from putting a bullet into the back of his head after he ordered Thulgira to stomp The Midget as if he were an ant? I killed your god, now worship me. Would that work on Sang? The man practically pissed his pants whenever The Midget called or visited them, but the General didn't strike him as one who deified his ruler. Kill me and you lose control of Thulgira. He will go wild and destroy your country. I am the only one who can prevent that. That could work. After all, they had seen what the monster did to South Kor . . . Something rumbled through the air. Barznav looked up, searching the sky for the source of the noise. Obviously a jet. There was a war going on. It was probably North Korean MiGs headed south to bomb something or provide air cover or – A piercing, sustained wail erupted throughout the complex. \"Air raid!\" one of Barznav's guards shouted. \"Air raid! Hurry!\" The guard waved him toward a half-oval shaped building that hid the tunnel leading to sub-levels. Barznav ran best he could, panting before he reached the entrance. Barznav about collapsed when he and his guards got into the elevator. He leaned against the wall, a hand over his pounding heart, taking one deep breath after another. \"Are you all right, Sir?\" asked the guard. \"Y . . . Yes,\" he gasped. Dammit, his lungs were burning. No matter how much he breathed, he just couldn't get enough air. Oh, how he hated running. By the time they reached the command center, Barznav's breathing was somewhat normal. \"What's going on, General?\" he asked Sang, then inhaled deeply. \"Radar has detected three low-flying objects crossing our coastline and heading for this base.\" Sang pointed to one of the wall monitors. It showed an image of the North Korean west coast, with three missile tracks edging closer to the base. Barznav's mouth went dry. His heart went into overdrive again, this time from anxiety. No, no, no. This couldn't happen. He couldn't have his plans, his dreams, ruined like this. \"Stop them!\" he blurted, then bit his lip. Paranoia crept into his head. Would Sang find the outburst suspicious? The General turned to him. \"That is exactly what I intend to do.\" He picked up a phone and waited a few seconds before speaking. \"This is General Sang. Do you have the inbound enemy missiles on radar . . . Good. You know what to do.\" Sang flicked a switch to put the phone onto the loudspeaker and replaced the receiver. \"Phoenix One-Three, intercept Target One. Phoenix One-Five, intercept Target Two.\" \"One-Three acknowledges.\" \"One-Five acknowledges.\" Barznav swallowed, his eyes fixed on the missile tracks as they drew closer, closer. Come on, you idiots. Shoot the damn things down. \"Phoenix One-Three. Battery at full power.\" \"Phoenix One-Five. Battery at full power.\" \"Target One acquired.\" \"Target Two acquired.\" \"Phoenix One-Three, firing.\" \"Phoenix One-Five, firing.\" Barznav's stomach churned as he watched the radar image. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead as the missiles near the base perimeter. No, no! They're going to hit! The missile tracks crossed over the base, and continued on. Seconds later one of the tracks vanished. Then the other. Slight vibrations rippled through the command center. \"The first two missiles have gone off-target and impacted in the forest,\" said the voice over the loudspeaker. \"No damage to the base. Repeat, no damage to the base.\" Barznav slouched, relief spreading through his body. That relief only lasted a second before he realized there was one more missile still headed for the base. \"Phoenix One-Five has target acquired. Firing.\" Again, Barznav tensed as he watched the missile track go over the base. Seconds later it disappeared, and he felt another, stronger vibration. He couldn't' breathe. What had it hit? Please not the antennas. \"Damage report,\" General Sang hollered into the phone. \"The last missile hit one of the barracks. Firefighters and rescue personnel are responding as we speak.\" \"What about the antennas and our communications facilities?\" \"All are intact, Sir.\" Barznav exhaled and bent over. Thank goodness. \"Comrade General,\" a communications officer spoke up. \"The Great Leader wishes to speak with you.\" Sang visibly swallowed, then quickly composed himself. \"Put him through.\" The Midget's face appeared on one of the wall monitors. \"Great Leader of Our Party and Our Nation.\" Sang bowed. \"How may I serve you?\" \"First Air Combat Command has informed me that the imperialists have launched missiles at your base. What is your status? Do we still have control of Thulgira?\" \"Yes, You Excellency. We used our ZM-87 lasers to disable the guidance systems of the enemy missiles. Two of the missiles crashed into the forests beyond this base. The third missile struck one of our barracks, but all our critical systems are intact.\" \"Good, good. Excellent. You have done well, Comrade General.\" \"Thank you, Most Beloved and Respected Leader.\" Sang bowed. \"You are indeed most gracious.\" Barznav tried not to roll his eyes. \"Still,\" The Midget said. \"We must assume the imperialists know that your base is where we control Thulgira. Their next attack could be much larger. Bolster the air defenses. More planes. More missiles. Whatever you require, ask and you shall have it.\" \"Yes, Your Excellency.\" \"Good. Comrade Barznav. Are you there?\" \"I am here, Great Leader.\" He wanted to grimace at using the idiotic title. \"Soon your base will be one of the most secure places in the People's Republic. The imperialists will never be able to penetrate it. And with Thulgira showing he is unstoppable, it is time to expand our war.\" \"Expand it?\" \"Yes. The dogs in the South and their American puppet masters are all but defeated. We will now turn our attention to Japan, repay them for the atrocities they visited on our nation tenfold. Currently, a flotilla of three Japanese destroyers is patrolling to the west of Ullung-do Island in the East Sea. That island is ours! The entire East Sea is ours now! The Japanese must learn that. We will sink those ships, and if the Japanese wish to retaliate, you will send Thulgira after them and wipe them out!\" \"Yes, Great Leader.\" The Midget smiled. \"And be sure to have Thulgira ready for our celebration.\" \"Celebration?\" \"Yes. When The Fatherland has been reunited, we shall have a massive celebration at Kumgangsan Park. I shall be there, along with all our prominent government and military officials, and hundreds of thousands of workers. We shall all be there to celebrate the greatest triumph in Korea's history.\" Barznav smiled. \"That is a most excellent idea, Great Leader.\" Indeed it was. The entire North Korean leadership, all in one place. Barznav's smile continued to grow. So did The Midget's. The fool. He probably thought Barznav was imagining how glorious the victory celebration will be. It will be glorious . . . for me. In one fell swoop, he would use Thulgira to eliminate the entire North Korean leadership. The country would have no choice but to accept him as its new ruler. First this country, then the world. TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTES: USAF – United States Air Force JASSM – Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Mark One Eyeball – Military slang for the human eye ZM-87 – This is a real world vehicle-mounted laser weapon. In 2003, North Korea reportedly used a ZM-87 to try and blind the pilots of two US Apache attack helicopters. While its primary purpose is to blind troops, it can reportedly be used to scramble electronics as well. East Sea - What the Koreas call the Sea of Japan Kumgangsan Park - Largest national park in North Korea[Chapter 8] A sliver of light appeared in front of Rice. It grew steadily larger. Soon the light turned into a bland green ceiling. He blinked a couple times and slowly turned his head from left to right. A bed sat on either side of him. Both were occupied. The man on his left had half his face covered with a bandage. I'm in a hospital. He scrunched his face, trying to figure out how he got here. He remembered a bridge, and gunfire. And a turtle. A giant turtle. Memories tore through his mind like water bursting from a dam. It all came back to him. Taking out the North Korean Special Purpose Forces on the bridge. Thulgira and Gamera duking it out. That feeling of being inside Gamera's mind. Then . . . Oh my God! Rice sat up in bed, vaguely aware of a rapid series of beeps from the nearby monitor. He pressed a hand against his chest. It didn't hurt at all. What the hell? He pulled up the collar of his hospital gown and looked beneath it. There wasn't so much as a scratch anywhere on his torso. His mouth hung open wordlessly as he stared at the wall in front of him. How could this be possible? Last thing he remembered he had a huge hole in his chest gushing blood. He couldn't recall getting shot or hit with shrapnel. But Gamera had been impaled by Thulgira. Gamera. He slapped a hand just under his throat. His body sagged in relief when he felt his pendant. A short, stocky dark-haired woman in Army fatigues entered the room. A nurse, he assumed. \"Commander! You're awake. How are you feeling?\" \"Uh, fine. Fine.\" He winced, noticing how dry his throat felt. \"Where am I?\" \"You're at the hospital at Gwangju Air Base. They brought you here after the retreat.\" \"Retreat?\" The nurse's face fell. \"The line at Daejon fell two days ago. Then yesterday the monster destroyed Kunsan Air Base.\" Rice closed his eyes and hung his head. His throat clenched. First Daejon, then Kunsan. How long before Thulgira wiped out Gwangju? Then what? This far south, the only place they could regroup from here was the Korea Strait. \"Um, try not to worry about that now. You need to concentrate on getting better,\" the nurse tried to say with conviction. \"I'll go tell the doctor you're awake.\" Rice just stared at her as she left. \" Try not to worry?\" Was she serious? How could anyone not worry? They were getting their asses kicked. Most of South Korea was under North Korean control. How much longer could they keep fighting? What good would it do, anyway? Thulgira was invincible. No. Nothing is invincible. Any opponent can be defeated. We will defeat him. Rice held his breath. That last thought. Had that come from him? It almost sounded like someone, or something, whispered it in the back of his mind. His muscles tensed. A jolt of pure energy shot through him. He clutched the pendant. Water surrounded him, yet he didn't get wet. He could also breathe normally. Actually, he felt there, but not there. Did that even make sense? He felt another presence around him, or maybe part of him. Gamera. He's alive! Relief and elation surged through him. Turtle, you are one tough SOB. You heal me. I heal you. There it was again. Another voice in his mind. My God, Gamera was actually talking to him! He fell back against his pillow, still clutching his pendant. He felt a sort of comfort being connected to Gamera, knowing he was alive. At the same time, uneasiness and confusion plagued him. How was this even possible? How could he be linked to a giant fire-breathing turtle? Was this a permanent thing? A thought like that should have scared him, but it didn't. It didn't feel like Gamera wanted to control him. He couldn't even say that he fully controlled Gamera. That was probably a good thing. No one man should have control of something so powerful. That is why you are a worthy Link. Rice's muscles knotted. Could anything be more unsettling than another thing's voice in your head? Do not be scared. We are linked. Your thoughts. My thoughts. We must be linked for the coming battle. \"Against Thulgira.\" Rice grimaced, not meaning to speak aloud. He looked at the other wounded men around him. Both appeared to be sleeping. Thulgira threatens the world. It must be stopped. Where did it come from? Gamera did not answer in words. Instead a series of images flashed through Rice's mind. Thulgira climbed out of the sea and stomped across the shore. Not one, but dozens of Thulgiras. Lasers tore through the air, blasting apart massive, gleaming citadels. A whooshing, whirring sound came from the sky. Gamera. Dozens of Gameras. Lasers and fireballs criss-crossed the air between the two groups of monsters. \"Commander Rice?\" The weird mind movie vanished. He whipped his head to the right to find a tall, lanky man with receding brown hair and glasses walking toward his bed. \"I'm Doctor Vernon, US Army. I'm glad to see you're awake. Nurse Palmer tells me you're feeling well.\" \"Yeah. Yeah, I am.\" \"Much as I'm glad to hear that, in all honesty, you shouldn't be. You lost a lot of blood, the lower half of your lung was shredded, and several of your ribs were shattered. Not just broke, Commander, shattered. That sent all sorts of splinters throughout your insides. By all rights, you should be dead. Instead, here you are completely healed. If I called The Vatican, they'd without a doubt certify this as a miracle.\" Rice glanced down at the pendant in his hand. \"Gamera,\" he whispered. \"What?\" He looked back at Doctor Vernon. \"Um, nothing, Doc. Look, like I told the nurse, I feel fine. Any idea when I can get out of this place? There's a war on, and we . . . I mean, I need to get back in it.\" \"I could discharge you right now. But there are some people who wanted to be informed when you woke up. People from Combined Forces Command.\" \"What do they want to see me for?\" \"Why do you think? You went from being on death's doorstep to suddenly becoming a perfect specimen of health. All the bloodwork we did on you came back normal. Cell samples we took from you and examined showed nothing out of the ordinary. Yet somehow you've completely healed. We even tried to exam that pendant of yours.\" \"Why?\" Rice asked defensively, holding it protectively against his chest. The veins in Vernon's neck stuck out. \"Well, because . . . um, this is going to sound unbelievable. There were times when it actually glowed. When we tried to remove it, it was scorching hot to the touch. It even burned through protective gloves, I'm talking about the kind we use in HAZMAT suits.\" Rice smiled. The amulet is for you and you alone, Gamera whispered in his mind. \"Anyway, someone from Combined Forces Command should be here soon. Meantime, are you up to seeing visitors before then?\" \"Sure.\" Vernon nodded and left the room. A couple minutes later several familiar figures strode through the door. \"Damn, Sir. You look a lot better than the last time we saw you.\" Candaele flashed him a grin. Rice grinned back. \"It's good to see you guys again. How are you doing?\" \"How are we doing?\" Senior Chief Warthan gave him an incredulous look. \"Who the hell cares how we're doing? None of us had a gaping, bloody hole in our chests.\" \"The doctors say what happened to you was a genuine miracle,\" Lieutenant Myung-Dae pointed out. \"How . . . How is this possible?\" \"Gamera.\" \"Gamera?\" Soto tilted his head. \"What's he have to do with this?\" Rice bit his lip, hesitant to answer. But hell, this was his team. More than his team. They were his friends. They'd been there at the bridge when Gamera fought Thulgira. They'd seen what happened to him. He told them everything. His link with Gamera, how Gamera helped him heal from an otherwise fatal injury, and how imperative it was to stop Thulgira. All of his SEALs, even Myung-Dae, stared at him with their mouths agape when he told them about the movie-like sequence of the ancient war between the Gameras and Thulgiras. \"All of this from a big-ass turtle.\" Candaele shook his head. \"If I hadn't'a seen what happened to you on that bridge, I'd think you were out of your mind, Sir.\" \"Trust me, sometimes I feel like I'm out of my mind, and I'm the one going through this.\" \"Attention!\" Myung-Dae stood ramrod straight. The other SEALs looked to the door, and snapped to attention. A tall, broad-shouldered black man wearing an ACU entered the room. Rice noticed four stars stitched into the man's collar. The name tag on the uniform's left breast read TAYLOR. As in General Michael Taylor, commander of US Forces Korea and Combined Forces Command. \"Sir!\" Rice saluted and tried to get to his feet. \"At ease.\" Taylor held up a hand. \"You stay in bed, Commander.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Rice watched other people file into the room. All were Asian. One he recognized from his first briefing in South Korea. Commander Whan from Defense Security Command. Three of the newcomers were women. One wore fatigues with two stars on the collar, a name tag that read LI, and a tab on the right breast with the words US AIR FORCE. The remaining two women wore civilian clothes. One was attractive and slender with smooth, tan features and long dark hair, a loose-fitting beige shirt, jeans and hiking boots. The other, who was short and had her hair in a bun, wore a pants suit. The final member of the group was a craggy-faced man dressed in black-green-brown splotched fatigues. Rice cranked an eyebrow. The civilian women and the craggy-faced man didn't look Korean. If anything, they looked Japanese. \"We've been waiting for you to wake up, Commander Rice.\" A wry grin crossed Taylor's lips. \"Jim Rice, eh? Let me guess. Your parents were Red Sox fans.\" \"Yes, Sir. Big time.\" \"Hell of a player back in the day. Course, I grew up near Baltimore, so I was an Eddie Murray man myself.\" \"He was a hell of a player, too.\" \"That he was. Well, much as I'd love to talk baseball with you, we need to get down to business.\" Taylor stepped to the side and pointed a hand to the Asians. \"I believe you know Commander Whan. General Li here is the CFC's chief of intelligence. And these three are our Japanese contingent. Colonel Shigeru Ishiba is with the Self-Defense Forces Joint Staff Office. Dr. Mayumi Nagamine is the leading expert on giant monsters in Japan, and probably the world. And Miss Ayumi Hara is a translator attached to the Ministry of Defense.\" \"Commander.\" Nagamine stepped forward and bowed. \"Your pendant. May I see it?\" Hara translated for her. Rice bit his lower lip, hesitant to show it to a stranger, a stranger who might take it. Show her, Gamera whispered. She is a friend. \"He knows you?\" Rice's forehead crinkled as he stared at Nagamine. \"Excuse me.\" \"Gamera. He knows you.\" Taylor, Li and Ishiba all exchanged befuddled looks. Even Hara scrunched her face at him. Still, she spoke again for Nagamine. \"I was involved with Gamera when he first fought the Gyaos. He must know me through Asagi.\" \"Who?\" Nagamine smiled at him. \"Please. Show me your pendant, and I'll tell you.\" Rice hesitated a moment before holding it up for her to see. \"Yes, that's exactly the same sort of stone Asagi wore when she was linked to Gamera.\" \"Wait a minute. You mean what's happening to me has happened to someone else before?\" Nagamine nodded. \"Yes. A girl named Asagi Kusanagi.\" \"Why does Gamera need to have a human linked to him?\" \"From what Asagi told me, Gamera's human link can be used as a source of strength. It turned out to be very critical in his battle with the last of the original Gyaos. Gamera suffered many injuries and was weakening, but Asagi's will allowed him to overcome it and kill the Gyaos.\" \"You said Gamera was hurt in that fight,\" Warthan chimed in. \"Did those injuries have any affect on this Asagi girl?\" \"Yes. The injuries Gamera suffered, she also suffered. It would appear the same was true for you, Commander.\" \"Ain't that the truth. The moment Gamera got stabbed, the same thing happened to me. Thank God he transferred some of his strength to me, otherwise I'd be dead.\" \"How is that even possible?\" Li asked in an awed tone. Nagamine turned to Colonel Ishiba, who scanned everyone around Rice's bed before speaking. \"What I am about to tell you is top secret. Contrary to popular belief, Gamera is not a product of nature. It was built by an advanced ancient civilization roughly ten thousand years ago to protect them against the Gyaos.\" \"And probably Thulgira, too,\" Rice said. \"Or actually, Thulgiras.\" \"Are you saying there are more of those things?\" asked Taylor. \"How do you know that?\" \"Gamera showed me. It looks like they invaded this civilization you're talking about.\" Surprise registered on Nagamine's face. \"None of the evidence we recovered suggests they created any other monsters.\" \"Perhaps there was another civilization that went to war with that one,\" Myung-Dae suggested, \"and they used Thulgira as a weapon, just as the North is doing.\" \"You could be right, Lieutenant,\" said Whan. \"But an ancient war does not concern us now. Stopping Thulgira in the present is the only thing that matters.\" He looked to Rice. \"You are certain you can use Gamera to kill Thulgira.\" \"I don't use Gamera, Sir. At least to some extent. I mean, there were times during that fight with Thulgira that he mimicked the sort of moves I'd use in hand-to-hand combat.\" \"It probably has to do with your military background,\" Nagamine noted. \"I suspect The Links with the ancient Gameras were warriors as well, people strong both physically and mentally.\" \"That describes a SEAL, and then some,\" said Taylor. \"I guess we're lucky you wound up with that amulet, Commander. Men like you are trained to fight through fatigue and pain to get the job done.\" \"Like we say, Sir, pain is just weakness leaving the body. You get me out of here, I'll make damn sure Gamera and I put Thulgira down permanently.\" \"That's what we're counting on. In fact, we even have a plan to make that happen. I'll have one of the nurses get some fatigues for you, then I want you and your unit over in the administration building in a half-hour for a briefing. XXXXX Rice and his men were there in fifteen minutes. He had jumped out of bed and dressed in a hurry, anxious to get out of the hospital and back in the fight. There wasn't much of South Korea controlled by the South Koreans any more, so time was of the essence to stop Thulgira. When they entered the briefing room, Rice spotted a solidly built man with chiseled features and intense eyes. \"Commander Kon.\" Rice's eyes widened in surprise when he recognized the South Korean SEAL. He smiled wide and walked over to him. \"Good to see you again, Sir.\" \"And you.\" Kon nodded and shook his hand. \"It would seem you have cheated death. I never realized that could be one of the benefits of having a giant turtle for a pet.\" \"Heh! Pets are something you get at a store. This one . . . well, it's kind of a long story.\" \"General Taylor and Doctor Nagamine have filled me in.\" \"Hard to believe, isn't it?\" Kon shrugged. \"It is what it is.\" Rice chuckled. That was one of the things he admired about Kon. Absolutely nothing fazed the guy, not even a crazy situation like this. \"You know one another?\" asked Commander Whan. \"Yeah,\" Rice answered. \"My SEAL Team cross-trained with Commander Kon's my last time here in South Korea.\" \"That's good,\" said Taylor. \"Now, if you'll all take your seats, we'll get started. General Li.\" The head of CFC intelligence turned on the wall monitor, which showed an overhead image of a complex with several large antennas and satellite dishes. \"Just to bring you up to speed, Commander Rice, this is the target for Commander Kon and his SEAL platoon. It's a facility twenty miles north of Kaesong, and it's from here the North Koreans are controlling Thulgira.\" Rice held his breath and leaned forward. \"How are they doing it?\" \"With an extremely low frequency signal from the largest antenna there. Commander Kon's platoon is tasked with neutralizing it.\" Rice turned to the Korean SEAL. \"No offense to you and your guys, Commander, but it'd be easier, and a lot less risky, to take this place out with some cruise missiles or JDAMs.\" \"We tried that.\" Li frowned momentarily. \"One of our subs in the Yellow Sea launched three Tomahawks at this complex. Before they could hit their target, all three had their guidance systems scrambled. From what our analysts can determine, it looks like the North Koreans used ZM-87 lasers.\" Rice sighed. He knew about those weapons. The North Koreans used them several years ago to try and blind some US Army helicopter pilots along the DMZ. It was also thought the ZM-87s could be used to disrupt the electronics of guided weapons. I guess we found out the hard way they can. \"We also ruled out a massive air strike against the complex.\" Taylor leaned back in his seat. \"We don't have enough planes in-country to carry it out. Plus the North has increased its anti-air assets in and around the complex, and has at least a dozen MiG-29s and MiG-21s covering the area.\" \"Our best chance,\" said Li, \"is for Commander Kon's SEALs to infiltrate the complex and destroy the antenna. But that's just one part of their mission. The other is to retrieve a high value target.\" The image on the screen changed to show a portly middle-aged man staring straight up. \"This was taken by a Global Hawk minutes before the cruise missile strike. Our guess is he heard the noise from the missiles and looked up. Lucky for us he did, because we just may have found the man responsible for controlling Thulgira.\" \"So who is this guy?\" Rice nodded to the screen. \"Doctor Uldis Barznav,\" answered Li. \"A Russian?\" asked Warthan. \"A Latvian, actually. Though during the Cold War, he did work for the KGB in a directorate that conducted research into some rather . . . unique methods of combat and espionage. Barznav's specialty was using radio waves to control animals. And he did have some success, using dogs and wolves to attack people with the flick of a switch. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, Barznav's section was shut down, and he found himself out of a job.\" \"Until the North Koreans offered him one,\" muttered Rice. Li nodded. \"We want Commander Kon's SEALs to capture Barznav and bring him back here so we can find out what he knows, and maybe use that knowledge to prevent any more giant monster attacks.\" Or use those monsters as weapons. His insides tightened. Would they try to use Barznav's knowledge to control Gamera? No. No way I'll let that happen. His fear grew, to the point he couldn't breathe. Would he actually oppose his own government, the government he had served for eight years? He loved his country, would fight and die for it. But it wasn't right to control Gamera. Work with him as a partner, of sorts, yes. But to control him, make him do things he may not want? And who's to say someone in the US government wouldn't become power mad and use Gamera like the North Koreans used Thulgira. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Rice closed his eyes tight, praying his worries never became reality. He turned to Kon. \"So how do you plan on infiltrating this place?\" \"My platoon will fly there aboard two United States Marine Corps V-22 Ospreys launched from our amphibious ship Dokdo . We'll go in at night, of course, fly at low level, and land eight kilometers from the complex. From there we'll hike in, destroy the antenna, and secure Doctor Barznav.\" \"You got good intel on the base? Number of personnel? Defenses? Layout?\" It was Whan who answered. \"Commander Kon will receive good intelligence and assistance from assets in the North.\" Whan didn't elaborate on those \"assets.\" Rice didn't expect him to, but he figured Whan was talking about spies. That didn't surprise him. The South Koreans' spy network in the North had to be as extensive as the North's was here. \"Our main concern is sailing a warship like the Dokdo so close to North Korea,\" Whan continued. \"If they spot it, they'll assume that we are about to conduct some sort of operation on their soil. Therefore, we will have Dokdo and her escorts behave as though they are conducting anti-submarine operations. We hope that will allay any suspicions on the North Koreans' part.\" \"In addition,\" Colonel Ishiba spoke. \"My government is sending a flotilla of six ships to the Yellow Sea, along with a squadron of F-15s, to conduct patrols, and hopefully draw some of the North Koreans' attention away from the Dokdo's group.\" Rice drew his head back in astonishment. \"You're actually sending combat forces into this war? Doesn't that go against Article Nine of your constitution?\" \"Japan's posture in this war changed dramatically while you were in your coma. Prior to the fall of Daejon, the North Koreans sent a squadron of missile boats to attack three of our destroyers patrolling near Ullung-do Island. They sank the Hamagiri and damaged the Shimakaze. We managed to sink four of their boats before they withdrew.\" Rice let out a breath of incredulity. The crazy Umpa-Lumpa up north hadn't even finished taking over the rest of South Korea, and he wanted to pick a fight with another country? Then again, when he has a weapon like Thulgira, what does one more dog in the fight matter? \"Despite this unprovoked attack on our ships,\" Ishiba continued, \"we are forbidden by our constitution from declaring war on North Korea. However, The Diet has passed a resolution ordering the Defense Forces to take all necessary steps to protect Japanese lives and property from North Korean aggression.\" \"So what exactly does that mean?\" Rice asked. \"Are the Japanese going to start blasting North Korean ships and planes? Or actually send ground troops here?\" Ishiba shook his head. \"Our Defense Forces are just that. Strictly for defense. We can only engage the North Koreans if we are fired upon first. As for sending ground forces here, there is much resistance to that idea. Many in my country might construe that as a return to Japanese militarism. And in spite of the current situation, such a move may not sit well with the Koreans, given some of the . . . issues that arose during the Japanese occupation of the peninsula.\" Rice noticed anger lines digging into the faces of both Kon and Whan. \"Even if the Japanese did approve sending ground forces to Korea,\" Taylor began, \"I doubt the commitment would be very large. They'd likely want to keep the bulk of their troops on the Home Islands in case Thulgira invades.\" Rice looked to Ishiba. \"No offense, Colonel, but I've seen Thulgira in action. Unless you have some super secret weapon we don't know about, I doubt your forces will be any more successful than ours or the South Koreans.\" To his surprise, Ishiba gave him a wry grin. \"We do have a secret weapon, Commander Rice. You. You and Gamera.\" Rice nodded and shifted his gaze to General Taylor. \"Just tell me where and when, Sir. Gamera'll be ready.\" Taylor took the remote control from Li and put a map of the southern part of the peninsula on the screen. He got out of his seat and pointed to a spot to the northwest of Pusan. \"Here. Changwon. That's where our remaining forces in the west are gathering. That should make an inviting target for Thulgira, and that's what we're counting on. That's where you and your SEALs will deploy, Commander. As soon as Commander Kon and his men neutralize that antenna, you call in Gamera. Your SEALs will act as bodyguards for you while you and Gamera engage Thulgira. Lieutenant Myung-Dae. Senior Chief Warthan. As far as you're concerned, Commander Rice is the most important person on this peninsula. You keep his ass alive at all costs.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" they both replied. A solemn look fell over Taylor's face. \"Commander. This is our last roll of the dice. If we can't stop Thulgira this time . . . well, I don't have to spell it out for you, do I?\" \"No, Sir.\" Rice's stomach clenched. If they couldn't defeat Thulgira, South Korea was finished. Then it would be Japan's turn. And he couldn't imagine the crazy Umpa-Lumpa not turning Thulgira loose on the United States. Icy blades of fear dug into his bones. He pictured Rita, pictured his parents, and the rest of his friends and family stateside. That fear turned toward him. He tried to push it aside. It proved hard to do with the reality of the situation staring him right in the face. At Changwon, one of two things would happen. Either he and Gamera would defeat Thulgira, or they would die. TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTE: ACU – Army Combat Uniform, the replacement for the Battle Dress Uniform, aka BDU. JDAM – Joint Direct Attack Munition Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution states, \"The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes . . . The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\"[Chapter 9] Commander Kon never considered himself a sentimental man. Even so, he couldn't help but feel a tingle of pride every time he walked through the steel corridors of the Republic of Korea Ship Dokdo. While it resembled a shrunken aircraft carrier, Dokdo's official designation was an LPH, Landing Platform Helicopter. But sometimes, Kon liked to consider it a carrier. The ship was roughly the same size as Spain's carrier, the Principe de Asturias. Along with her ten helicopters, Dokdo also carried six Harrier jump jets, which the Republic got on loan from the British until they took delivery of the more advanced American F-35s. With a crew of 700, room to carry 720 marines and around 15 combat vehicles, and a top speed of 23 knots - fast for an amphibious ship her size - Dokdo represented a huge step toward making South Korea a true blue-water navy. Not that our naval dreams will matter if we do not destroy the antenna controlling Thulgira. Kon straightened his back and continued down the corridor. He summoned all the confidence he possessed. In his 13 years in the navy, he had never, ever, failed at any task his superiors assigned him. He would not fail this time. He could not afford to. Kon opened a hatch and entered the cramped, semi-dark Combat Information Center. Several officers and sailors sat at consoles and stared into various screens. Larger monitors dominated the bulkheads across from him, showing radar images or video feeds from Dokdo and the other ships in her group. To his left, two men used grease pencils to draw on a plot board. The corners of Kon's mouth briefly twitched. Even in the age of satellites and computers and 3-D imaging, ships still used old-fashioned, clear plastic plot boards. \"Ah, Commander Kon.\" Kon turned to the right and spotted a short man with a round face and glasses. \"Captain.\" He snapped to attention and saluted Captain Byung-Jae, Dokdo's skipper. \"You wanted to see me?\" Byung-Jae returned the salute. \"Yes. We have some updated intelligence on your target.\" He took a folder from one of his officers and handed it to him. \"These were taken by an American Global Hawk less than an hour ago.\" Kon studied the images. One photo showed two groups of people beyond the fenceline. Some were digging with shovels, others knelt on the ground, placing something into the freshly dug holes. Landmines. A danger, but one they could handle. He and his SEALs didn't plan on infiltrating the complex from those directions anyway. Thanks to their assets in the North, they would be going right through the front gate. So long as they are ready when we land. If they weren't, well, they'd just have to find another way in. And thanks to these pictures, he knew which direction not to go. The Global Hawk also identified the position of one of the ZM-87 lasers, stationed roughly two kilometers from the complex. Kon wondered how much good that would do him. The ZM-87 was mounted on a truck. It could be somewhere else by the time they arrived. His biggest concern was the increased defenses around the base. Two machine gun nests now covered the front gate outside the fence. The North Koreans also added more anti-air systems in and around the complex. The SAMs didn't concern him much. The anti-aircraft guns did. The S-60s and the ZSU-23s could easily be used in an anti-personnel role. Their big rounds, designed to tear through the metal frames of jets, could just as easily tear through human flesh. I may have to assign extra personnel to neutralize them. He stifled a groan. He hated changing plans hours away from an operation, but that was the way things went in the world of special operations. You either adapted quickly, or you died. \"Thank you, Captain. Is there anything else to report from the target area?\" \"Yes.\" Byung-Jae waved for him to follow. They walked over to a row of consoles and stood behind a slight, bespectacled man. \"This is Lieutenant Sehang, our meteorological officer. Lieutenant, Commander Kon of the Naval Special Warfare Brigade.\" \"Sir.\" Sehang nodded to him. \"I believe you have something to show the Commander that could affect his mission.\" \"Yes, Captain.\" Sehang tapped on his keyboard and brought up a digital map of Korea on his screen. He then spoke in a monotone voice. \"We are currently tracking a thunderstorm approaching from Haeju Bay. It is moving in a southeasterly direction at twenty miles per hour. By our estimates, it will settle over Kaesong an hour before your unit is scheduled to land.\" Kon fought off a frown. Another complication we can do without. \"Any idea how long the storm will last over Kaesong?\" \"Anywhere from three to five hours. That is the best estimate I can give you.\" \"What about lightning and wind conditions?\" \"We have detected several lightning strikes within the storm cell. As for wind, speeds can range anywhere from twenty-five to thirty-five miles per hour from the southeast.\" Kon said nothing. He just stared at the animated blob of green with some sprinkles of yellow and red mixed in as it blotted out much of the North Korean west coast. His mind ran down the problems his platoon would likely encounter on the ground. Mud and limited visibility, which would slow their progress to the target. The lightning could interfere with their radios and other electronic equipment. He and the others would also be soaked, cold and uncomfortable. That last part didn't concern him. All SEALs lived like that their first few weeks of training. \"Are the Osprey pilots aware of this storm?\" asked Kon. \"Yes, Commander,\" Sehang replied. \"My department will provide them with updates every half-hour until they take-off.\" \"Good.\" Kon nodded, anxious to get back to his SEAL platoon. They'd have to make some adjustments to their assault plan, factoring in the added anti-aircraft weapons and the thunderstorm. \"Please keep me informed also of this storm's progress. We must be -\" \"Captain!\" A paunchy man with the insignia of a lieutenant stood up by a row of consoles to the right. Dokdo's detection/tracking officer, Kon realized. \"Radar has detected six aircraft inbound from the north, not squawking proper IFF.\" \"Range?\" \"Sixty kilometers, bearing zero-two-three.\" \"Watch officer, sound general quarters. Tactical Action Officer, alert the other ships.\" High-pitched wails blared throughout the CIC, and the rest of the ship. Kon stepped backwards until he pressed against the wall and quietly observed the situation. \"The other ships have the bandits on radar,\" reported the TAO. \"All anti-aircraft missiles and guns are standing by.\" Byung-Jae nodded, then turned to his left. \"Air Control Officer. Vector our CAP toward the bandits and launch our Alert Five Harriers.\" \"Vectoring CAP toward the bandits, aye. Launching Alert Five Harriers, aye.\" \"Captain,\" blurted the tracking/detection officer. \"Bandits positively identified. Six North Korean MiG-23 fighter-bombers.\" Kon felt his breathing increase as adrenaline pumped through his veins. He fixed his gaze on one of the monitors that showed the six MiG-23s rocketing toward Dokdo's group. Two other tracks headed right for them, the Harriers on Combat Air Patrol duty. \"Comet Three-Three,\" the voice of one of the Harrier pilots came through the intercom. \"Bandits acquired on radar. Forty kilometers and closing. Locking on AMRAAMs . . . Good tone.\" \"Comet Three-Five. AMRAAM lock, good tone also.\" \"Comet Three-Three. Fox Three.\" \"Comet Three-Five. Fox Three.\" Four new tracks appeared on the display screen. AMRAAM medium-range missiles launched by the Harriers. Kon held his breath, watching the missile tracks close with the MiGs. Closer. Closer. Several of the MiG symbols rapidly changed direction. No doubt jinking and dumping chaff and flares to throw off the incoming missiles. One MiG symbol vanished. Then another. Another. \"Splash one . . . splash two . . . Three! Splash three bandits!\" A new missile track appeared. This one from one of the MiGs. \"Enemy missile launch!\" hollered Comet Three-Three. \"Infra-red missile launch! Deploying flares!\" Now the Harriers banked and dove. Tension coiled around Kon as his eyes flickered between the missile track and the Harriers. Miss . . . miss . . . miss. It did. The missile flew between the Harriers and continued through the sky. \"Alert Five Harriers airborne,\" announced the Air Control Officer. The screen now showed the South and North Korean jets intermingled. Kon saw one of the Harriers drop behind a MiG-23. \"Comet Three-Three. Fox Two.\" The Harrier fired a Sidewinder heat-seeking missile. Kon drew a breath as he watched the missile track merge with the MiG. Both suddenly vanished. \"Splash one! Repeat, splash one bandit.\" \"I doubt there will be any MiGs left by the time the Alert Five Harriers get there,\" Captain Byung-Jae said to no one in particular. Kon caught a couple of the CIC personnel smiling. \"Captain,\" the TAO called out. \"Message from the Kang Gamchan. She reports six surface contacts inbound from the east, bearing zero-four-six. Thirty kilometers and closing.\" Kon's chest tightened. First MiGs, now ships? Was it just the North Koreans wanting to take out one of the Republic's largest surface ships, or did they suspect they might try to attack the complex at Kaesong? We're more than 120 kilometers from Kaesong. They cannot suspect that. He refocused on the display. Only one MiG-23 remained, and it had turned tail and was heading back to North Korea. \"Vector all Harriers toward the surface contacts,\" ordered Captain Byung-Jae. \"We have a feed coming through from the P-3,\" said the TAO. Seconds later a video image appeared on one of the monitors, broadcast live from the P-3 Orion patrol plane supporting Dokdo's group. Kon saw five small, oblong vessels with pointy bows racing across the water. They surrounded a stubby ship only slightly bigger that sported a small superstructure and a round forward-mounted turret. He instantly recognized all the vessels. Three Sohung-class missile boats, two Ku Sung-class torpedo boats, and in the middle, a Sariwon-class corvette. Relics, all of them. Just like most of the surface ships in the North Korean Navy. Kang Gamchan, one of the Republic's most advanced destroyers, could easily destroy that entire flotilla single-handedly. A cloud of orange and black obscured all three Sohungs. Six contrails sped away from the little ships. \"Missile launch!\" shouted the surface search radar operator. \"Six tracks. Repeat, six tracks. All inbound to our position. Twenty kilometers and closing.\" \"They're likely SS-N-2s,\" noted the TAO. \"Old but still effective.\" \"Evasive maneuvers,\" ordered Byung-Jae. \"Weapons officer, prepare RAM and Goalkeepers for action.\" \"RAM and Goalkeepers online and ready to fire.\" Kon felt the Dokdo turn sharply to starboard. His eyes remained fixed on the display screen. The SS-N-2s drew closer. Fifteen kilometers. Ten. Kon watched the Kang Gamchan and the two Pohang-class corvettes Seongnam and Yeongju position themselves between the Dokdo and the incoming missiles. Kon felt every muscle in his face tighten as the missile tracks approached. Eight kilometers away. Seven . . . six . . . five. One of the video feeds from the Kang Gamchan showed flashes of smoke and flame, and trails of fire racing over the waves. RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles. One of the SS-N-2s disappeared from the display. Then two . . . three . . . four. The remaining two SS-N-2s streaked toward Dokdo. Kon's shoulders knotted. Three kilometers. Two. Seongnam and Yeongju pounded away with their twin rapid-fire 40mm cannons. Tracers flashed through the air. Kon hoped to see explosions signifying the deaths of the last two missiles. He did not. Almost one kilometer left. A puff of smoke erupted from Kang Gamchan's side. A fireball appeared in midair. That had to be the destroyer's Goalkeeper, a gatling gun that unleashed a spray of hundreds of 30mm rounds in mere seconds. Another puff of smoke. Another fireball. No more missiles. Kon joined the collective sigh of relief throughout the CIC. He checked the screen again. Don't relax just yet. The North Korean flotilla kept coming. They may have expended all their surface-to-surface missiles, but those Ku Sungs could still hurt them with their torpedoes. And if they got close enough, all six ships had plenty of guns to give them grief. More contrails rose from Dokdo's three escorts. Harpoon missiles, a much more advanced anti-ship missile than the Soviet-made SS-N-2. Kon watched the feed from the P-3. The North Korean ships began zigzagging. A few even launched chaff. Tracers shot into the sky in all directions. A cylindrical object dropped straight down on one of the missile boats. It vanished in a volcanic blast of fire and water. Seconds later another missile boat exploded into nothingness. The Harpoons also took out the last Sohung-class missile boat and one of the Ku Sung torpedo boats. That still left the corvette and the other torpedo boat, which were now in visual range of Dokdo's group. \"Torpedoes in the water!\" hollered the sonar operator. \"Two torpedoes bearing one-six-five!\" \"Evasive maneuvers!\" ordered the captain. Again Kon swayed as Dokdo turned sharply to avoid the torpedoes from the Ku Sung. On one of the video monitors, he watched both Pohang-class corvettes open up with their 76mm guns. Huge water spouts rose around the torpedo boat. The Sariwon-class corvette fired its 85mm gun. Shells splashed between the Dokdo and the Kang Gamchan. Stubby swept-winged aircraft streaked into view on the P-3's feed. The Harriers from Dokdo. Unfortunately, their air-to-air missiles were no good against ships. The same could not be said for their twin 25mm cannons. The Harriers dove on the North Korean ships. Flames rippled from their bellies. Tracers stitched across the water and across the ships. Smoke and flames gushed from the torpedo boat. \"Both enemy torpedoes missed,\" announced the sonar operator. \"Repeat. Both torpedoes missed.\" Kon felt the tension dissolve from his muscles. He almost slumped in relief, but maintained his posture. The feed from the P-3 showed a fireball blossoming from the Sariwon-class corvette. Either one of the Pohangs hit it with their 76mm guns, or the shell came from Kang Gamchan's five-incher. Either way, Kon doubted the enemy ship could survive another hi- \"Torpedoes!\" cried out the sonar operator. \"Two torpedoes bearing two-five-seven! Five thousand meters and closing!\" Kon's eyes widened. His chest tightened in dread. Where the hell had those torpedoes come from? Both North Korean torpedo boats had been neutralized. \"Hard to port!\" Captain Byung-Jae hollered. \"Hard to port! Source of that launch!\" \"Sub-surface,\" answered the sonar operator. \"There must be an enemy submarine near . . . wait!\" He slapped his hands over his headphones. \"Two more launches! Two torpedoes, bearing three-one-six. They're headed for Kang Gamchan!\" \" Kang Gamchan is aware of the torpedoes and is taking evasive action,\" the TAO notified them. \"First set of torpedoes, four thousand meters and closing.\" Kon banged a fist against the side of his leg. He had to do something! But what could he do? It was up to Captain Byung-Jae and his crew to fight the ship. He was just a passenger, a passenger with the most critical mission in his nation's history entrusted to him and his SEALs. Now that mission was jeopardized, and couldn't do a damn thing about it. Trust in this crew. They must be good to serve on a ship like this. The thought did nothing to alleviate his helplessness. Men like him acted, they did not let others act for them. \"Two thousand meters and closing,\" announced the sonar operator. Sweat formed on Kon's brow. He tried to push down his mounting fear of his mission failing before they could even launch. Even if we die, there is still Commander Rice and Gamera. And what if they fail? Dokdo swerved again. \"One thousand meters and closing . . . five hundred meters!\" Byung-Jae snatched the microphone connected to Dokdo's shipwide intercom. \"All hands, brace for impact! All hands, brace for impact!\" Kon pressed himself hard against the bulkhead. He held his breath, praying the torpedoes would miss. A deafening crash filled the air. A quake tore through the entire ship. Kon flew off the bulkhead. He twisted and landed on his back, hard. Pain slammed into his muscles and bones. He clenched his teeth and groaned. Cries of pain and panic rose all around him. He rolled on his stomach and pushed himself up, scanning the CIC. Half the screens on the bulkhead and the consoles had gone black. Several sailors and officers picked themselves off the floor. A few had trickles of blood running down their faces. A couple gripped their arms, their faces twisted in agony. The captain ordered those men with obvious broken bones to report to sick bay, then asked for a damage report. \"Two hits to port, both near the stern,\" stated the CIC Watch Officer. \"Flooding in the lower decks. Engine One and Engine Two have suffered severe damage. There is also a fire in the hangar.\" Byung-Jae snatched up a phone from his console. \"Bridge, Captain. Can you still maneuver . . . At what speed . . . ten knots!\" He scowled at the news. \"Keep moving, best possible speed. We still have an enemy sub out there. Let's not make things easy for it. Captain out.\" \"Captain,\" called out the TAO. \"Both torpedoes missed the Kang Gamchan.\" \"At least someone is luckier than us. Do they know where the submarine is?\" \"Yes, Captain. They report it is over a kilometer away from us. The sub is identified as a Ming-class. Wait, Sir.\" The TAO held a phone to his ear. \" Kang Gamchan has launched two anti-submarine torpedoes at the enemy.\" \"Two more torpedoes in the water!\" hollered the sonar officer. \"From Kang Gamchan?\" asked the captain. \"No, Sir. Enemy torpedoes. Bearing one-nine-nine, headed straight for us. Four thousand meters and closing.\" Byung-Jae's jaw tightened. He swung his head toward Kon. \"Commander, I don't see any way we can avoid those torpedoes. You and your men must launch now.\" Kon clenched his teeth. They still had eighty miles to go to reach their launch point, and it was still daylight. But with two more torpedoes ready to tear into the damaged ship, what choice did they have? \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Good luck.\" Kon snapped off a quick salute and hurried out of the CIC. The loudspeakers blared in both Korean and English. \"All Naval Special Warfare Brigade and US Marine Corps flight personnel, report to your aircraft and prepare for immediate launch.\" Kon took the metal steps two at a time. He had to press against a bulkhead to allow three sailors to rush past him. Probably part of a damage control party. He again took off through the corridors and caught sight of the hatch leading to the flight deck. A tremendous thunderclap drilled into his ears. The entire world shook. He slammed against a bulkhead and crumpled to the ground. Pain lashed his body, especially his shoulder and back. Groaning, he slowly rose to his feet, flexing his right hand and running his fingers up his arm. He grimaced a couple times. It hurt, but it didn't feel like anything was broken. At least he hoped. Kon noticed something else. He was standing at an angle. No, not correct. Dokdo was at an angle. Ten degrees, he estimated. \"Commander!\" He looked up and saw a group of men in dark uniforms hurrying toward him, led by a stocky man with a weathered face. \"Chief Park.\" He nodded as his senior NCO approached, followed by the rest of his SEALs and the American flight crews. \"Is everyone present and accounted for?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Park handed him his gear and weapons. \"We had better get moving. I don't think this ship will last much longer.\" \"I'm afraid you're right.\" Kon felt the Dokdo list at fifteen degrees. He led the SEALs and US Marines outside. Acrid smoke immediately buffeted his face. He coughed as he looked around the flight deck. Flames and black smoke consumed Dokdo's stern. Teams of firefighters attacked the blaze with hoses. The SEALs and Marines sprinted toward a pair of whale-like aircraft with sloped tails and huge propellers on each wingtip. V-22 Ospreys. Kon pumped his legs furiously, Dokdo's list making it feel like running up hill. He estimated it at almost twenty degrees. A huge white bubble broke the surface in the distance. Kon guessed one or both of Kang Gamchan's torpedoes hit the North Korean submarine. Too little, too late. The Marine pilots and crew chiefs entered the tilt-rotor aircraft first, urged on by the deckhands. A half-minute later the rear ramps started to come down. \"The North Koreans added more anti-aircraft weapons at the complex,\" he told Chief Petty Officer Park. \"There is also a thunderstorm bearing down on Kaesong. I'll provide you more details after we reach the landing zone.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Park nodded to him, then led half the SEAL platoon to the second Osprey. Kon and the nineteen remaining SEALs scrambled inside the first Osprey. The second everyone was onboard, the American crew chief raised the ramp. Kon raced through the cargo hold and onto the flight deck. The pilot and the co-pilot, Captain Harrah and Lieutenant Fitzsimmons, frantically pressed buttons and flipped switches. \"No time to rundown the checklist,\" Harrah said. \"We don't get outta here now, we become submariners instead of pilots.\" \"I heard that,\" Fitzsimmons replied. \"Engines at sixty percent power . . . seventy . . . eighty.\" \"Transitioning to vertical flight mode.\" Kon looked out the windows. The Osprey's large propellers and nacelles began tilting toward the sky.\" \"All right, Fitz, we're good to go.\" \"Roger.\" Fitzsimmons signaled to the deckhands to remove the chock blocks keeping the aircraft in place Kon pressed his hands against the sides of the doorway as the Osprey slid to the right. \"Shit, shit shit!\" Harrah cursed. \"Hang on!\" The Marine captain mashed pedals and yanked back on the controls. The Osprey wobbled and lifted off the deck. It rose about forty feet before Harrah twisted the controls left. The Osprey turned. Kon looked out the pilot's side window. The other Osprey also slid down the deck, but recovered, turned and headed toward the water. Kon breathed easier. At least something finally went ri- A huge fireball tore through the Dodko's deck. Tremors from the explosions hammered the Osprey. Both the pilot and co-pilot fought to keep the aircraft level. Kon's eyes widened as the explosion tossed an SH-60 into the air. The helicopter spiraled across the deck . . . . and smashed into the other Osprey's tail section. The tilt-rotor whipped around in a 180, its tail ripped away. \"Holy shit!\" Harrah gawked out the window as the other Osprey nosed down. Its left propeller struck the side of the Dokdo. The blades shattered, sending pieces flying off in all directions, including into the Osprey itself. The shattered fuselage bounced off the side and crashed into the sea. A blade of nausea slashed at Kon's stomach. His throat clenched as he thought of Chief Park and the other SEALs onboard that Osprey. \"Nightshade Two, Nightshade Two, do you copy,\" Fitzsimmons said into the radio. \"Nightshade Two, please respond.\" As expected, there was no response. Kon closed his eyes and lowered his head. Half his platoon had died in the blink of an eye. Men he had served with for years. Images of their families spooled through his mind. He drew a breath and held it. Much as he wanted to, he didn't have time to mourn Park and the others right now. The mission came before everything else. \"Crap! Look out!\" Fitzsimmons shouted. Kon looked up. Hammer blows rocked the Osprey. Yellow tracers zipped by the Osprey. He looked down at the sea. More rounds came up from the Sariwon corvette and the Ku Sung torpedo boat. Even though both vessels were burning, they still had some fight left in them. Harrah yanked the controls hard left. The Osprey stood on its left wingtip and banked away from the anti-aircraft fire. \"Aw, dammit.\" Fitzsimmons scowled as he stared out the window. \"We've got holes in the starboard wing. Looks like one round went through the nacelle.\" \"Yeah, I'm getting a drop in oil pressure from the starboard engine.\" \"Can you still make it to the landing zone?\" Kon asked. Harrah turned to him. \"It's gonna be touch and go the way the engine is, Commander, but we'll do our damnedest. But, well, you guys are gonna be working at half-strength. Can you still pull off your mission?\" Kon's face stiffened. \"We must. We have no choice.\" TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTE: Blue-Water Navy: Term for a navy with global reach, as opposed to a green-water navy geared toward a coastal defense role.

He thought back to that night on the beach, the night he proposed to Rita, when this stone washed up by her feet. I wonder what she'd think if she knew her little good luck charm might be our last chance to stop Thulgira and the North Koreans. He pictured her in his mind's eye. What was she doing back in San Diego? Probably worrying herself to death over him. There sure as hell wasn't much good news regarding the war, unless you were North Korean. Did the Navy tell her about his injury? Did that make her even more afraid for him? God, what he wouldn't give to be with her right now, even for a minute. You'll see her again. He held on to that thought, let it give him strength, let it motivate him to help Gamera stop Thulgira once and for all. Rice peered through the bushes at the sprawling urban landscape of Changwon. The city was blacked out, not that it mattered to his night vision goggles. He scanned the streets, clogged with all manner of vehicles. Many people opted to leave their cars and trucks and flee on foot. Probably to Pusan. It wasn't like there were too many other places for them to go. His gaze shifted to the alluvial plain to the northeast. American and South Korean soldiers, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and artillery stretched across the flat land. Bait for Thulgira. Some bait. The troops and weapons down there represented the bulk of the US and ROK's remaining combat forces. Destroy them, and the North Koreans could easily march into Pusan and complete their conquest of South Korea. Rice checked around him. Warthan, Myung-Dae, Soto and Engle also concealed themselves within the foliage. Candale and Mongkut were stationed further out, covering the approaches to his position. No longer his SEALS. Now his bodyguards. The thought didn't sit well with him. It made him sound weak. His job was to protect people. People didn't need to protect him. Not that he could argue the point with the head of Combined Forces Command. And, while he hated to admit it, General Taylor was correct. Rice's pendant did make him the most important man in South Korea right now. They couldn't afford any harm to befall him. \"Soto. What's Thulgira's status?\" The unit's communications specialist kept tabs on the monster via a live link from a Global Hawk. \"Still headed our way. The ugly SOB should reach the outskirts of Changwon in about five hours.\" I am ready, Rice heard Gamera's thoughts. Soon, buddy. Soon. He stared past the mountains bordering the city, thinking of another group of SEALs much further north. It's all on you, Kon. As a great philosopher once said, \"Git 'er done.\" XXXXX The flight was more tense than Commander Kon would care to admit. The starboard engine constantly gave the pilots trouble, and came close to stalling at least four times. As low as they were to the water, there would be no time to recover from any stall. Just get us there. Just get us there. Kon repeated the mantra in his head. He checked on the other SEALs. Most sat hunched over, rubbing their hands together, lost in their own thoughts. Or probably, lost in just one thought. Please don't crash. The damaged engine also made the flight painstakingly slow. Kon doubted the V-22 Osprey had gotten over 230 miles-per-hour at any time. The tilt-rotor had a maximum speed of more than 340 mph. Kon wondered how far behind schedule they would be once they landed. If we land at all. A steady patter could be heard and felt throughout the Osprey. Kon groaned. That would be the rain Dokdo's meteorologist had predicted. It made the Osprey shudder constantly. A loud cough from the starboard engine penetrated the cabin. Kon's shoulders tensed. He bit his lower lip until it hurt. He noticed many of the other SEALs do the same. They were definitely afraid. He was afraid. But like him, they would rather die than show their fear. Thankfully, the Osprey stayed in the air. \"Okay, Commander,\" Fitzsimmons contacted him through his helmet's internal communications system. \"We are feet dry.\" \"Roger.\" Kon informed the other SEALs that they had just crossed the North Korean coastline. Several of them blew out long sighs of relief. Not long now until they reached their landing zone. Another sick groan came from the starboard engine. Everyone tensed again. The Osprey remained airborne. Minutes later, Kon heard Harrah say, \"Transitioning to vertical flight.\" The Osprey slowed to a crawl, then dipped to the right. Kon held his breath. Not now. Not when we're this close. The pilots leveled out the aircraft. Kon still held his breath until he felt a soft bump underneath him. They had finally landed. More importantly, they had landed in one piece. The rear ramp came down, revealing a driving rainstorm outside. \"In-Su,\" Kon called out to a tall, stout SEAL. With the death of Chief Petty Officer Park, Petty Officer First Class In-Su was now the unit's senior NCO. \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Get the men outside. I shall join you in a minute.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" As the SEALs hustled out of the Osprey, Kon jogged to the flight deck. \"Gentlemen,\" he said to the Marine pilots. \"I thank you for getting us to our objective safely, in spite of the damage to your aircraft. Your flying was truly exceptional.\" \"Thank you, Sir,\" replied Captain Harrah. \"Honestly, I think it was more luck than skill that got us here, but we'll take the compliment.\" Kon grinned briefly. \"What will you do now?\" The original plan called for the Ospreys to fly back to Dokdo, refuel, then return for the SEALs once they completed their mission. But Dokdo was likley at the bottom of the Yellow Sea, along with the other Osprey, and Kon doubted this Osprey would survive a second trip here. \"The closest ship we can land on is the George Washington,\" said Harrah, \"and she's probably a hundred-fifty miles south. No way we're gonna make it there in this bird. The best we can do is get as far from the coast as we can, ditch, and hope our side picks us up before the bad guys.\" Kon's jaw stiffened. That was extremely risky, but he couldn't see any other choice for the Americans. \"Good luck to you.\" He shook both Harrah's and Fitzsimmons' hands. \"Same to you, Commander,\" said Harrah. \"Good luck, Sir,\" Fitzsimmons added. \"Kick some ass for us.\" \"We intend to, Lieutenant.\" Kon shook hands with the crew chief and wished him good luck before exiting the Osprey. The other SEALs waited for him by a clump of trees. He was completely drenched by the time he reached them. The Osprey rose into the dark, rainy sky as Kon pulled his sealed orders from under his fatigues. He tore open the packet and pulled out the documents, each one covered in a clear waterproof folder. Using an infrared flashlight, he read each one, with In-Su and a few other SEALs hovering around him. The documents gave him names and photos of their contacts near Kaesong, along with a map and GPS coordinates for their rendezvous point. He also memorized the code phrase and response for the contacts. Kon stuffed the documents back into his fatigues and ordered the men to move out. He sent two SEALs, Young Ho and Kyu Bok, forty yards ahead to scout their path and watch for enemy patrols and treacherous terrain. They encountered no North Korean troops. The terrain, however, gave them some challenges. A few slopes had completely turned to mud and slowed their progress. More than a few SEALs slipped and fell. Aside from some cuts and bruises, none were seriously injured. Three miles into their march the thumping of rotorblades carried over the sound of the rain. They ducked behind trees and under bushes as a helicopter with a bulbous fuselage flew overhead. A Z-5, a Chinese-made copy of the old Soviet Mi-4 Hound. The helicopter shined a searchlight into the woods. Apparently it didn't spot any of the SEALs as it continued on. Kon observed it as its bright white searchlight grew smaller. He thought back to the Osprey's rough flight through the rain, and wondered if the ancient Z-5 fared even worse in this weather. He hoped so. Then maybe it would crash. The SEALs resumed their trek. The rain didn't let up. Kon was soaked to the bone. He felt the weight of his gear more and more as he walked. The muscles in his legs grew leaden. He had no doubt the other SEALs felt as he did. Still they kept going. Kon did not order any breaks. They couldn't afford to. An eternity later, Young Ho's voice came through Kon's radio. \"Commander. We've spotted two Zil trucks parked just inside the woods. They are at the same coordinates as our rendezvous point. There is one guard with an AK-74 rifle in front of the lead truck. He matches the photo of the contact named Hyo.\" \"Roger. Hold your position. I shall make contact with him. In-Su, I leave you in charge. If you hear any gunfire, go in, eliminate everyone in the trucks, and continue on with the mission. \"Yes, Sir.\" Kon set out toward the trucks, his boots squishing in the mud. He passed Young Ho and Kyu Bok. Both concealed themselves in the bushes, covering the rendezvous point with their compact Daewoo K1 carbines. The man by the trucks stiffened as Kon approached. He didn't raise his AK-74, but looked ready to if the situation warranted. \"Lee Man-Soo is the greatest player in the history of Korea Professional Baseball,\" Kon stated. The man with the AK-74 took a step forward. \"If he was so great, how come the Samsung Lions only won one championship during his entire career with them?\" Kon let out a short sigh of relief. The man had given the correct response. He walked up to him. \"Commander Kon.\" \"I am Hyo.\" Kon doubted that was the man's real name as he shook his hand. He then radioed the rest of his SEALs to join him. \"I thought there would be more of you.\" Hyo's brow furrowed as he took in Kon's unit. \"There were. Our ship was torpedoed by a North Korean submarine. We managed to get off. The rest of my team . . . was not so fortunate.\" Kon's teeth clenched as he recalled the shattered Osprey containing Chief Park and the others plunging into the sea. \"I am sorry.\" \"Thank you.\" Kon nodded. \"You have the information we need?\" \"Yes.\" Hyo looked over his shoulder and hollered, \"Lee! Shin! Min Ho!\" A short, slender woman emerged from the cab of the second truck. Her damp clothes clung to a very shapely figure. Three more people jumped out the back of the truck. Two of them, one lanky, the other muscular, gripped a slight, trembling young man by the arms. They half-walked, half dragged him over to Hyo and shoved him to the ground. \"Please don't hurt me,\" the young man's voice quivered. \"Please. I told you I'd do whatever you want.\" Kon approached the scared young man and studied him. He wore a pair of pajamas, soaked by the rain. A couple bruises stood out on his child-like face. He couldn't have been more than eighteen. \"Who is this?\" \"Private Sang Min of the Korean People's Army. He is with one of the supply units that service your target. Lee was able to use her . . . charms to put him at ease before we captured him.\" Sang Min looked over at Lee, whimpering, a hurt expression on his face. Lee's face was as unreadable as stone. \"We 'persuaded' him to give us everything he knew about the complex.\" Hyo reached into his tunic and produced a piece of paper covered in clear plastic. \"Thanks to his information, we came up with this diagram.\" Kon checked it over with his infrared flashlight, concentrating mainly on the lower levels of the complex. A few areas were left blank. No doubt restricted areas. One of them had to be the place where Barznav controlled Thulgira. Speaking of which . . . He pulled out the photo of Barznav and held it in front of Sang Min. \"Do you recognize this man?\" \"Yes, Yes. He is the scientist.\" \"Does he stay on the base?\" \"I don't know. I heard there are places in the sub-levels where the important people stay. They have big beds and sofas and microwave ovens there.\" Kon nodded. He thought it unlikely Barznav would live off-base. With a war on, the so-called Great Leader would want him as close to the devices that controlled Thulgira as possible. \"How many soldiers guard the base?\" \"A-A hundred or more. Maybe a hundred-forty or a hundred-fifty now, with the extra anti-aircraft guns and missiles there.\" \"Regular army or Special Purpose Forces?\" \"Regular soldiers.\" \"What about other personnel? Technical specialists? Support staff?\" \"Yes. Yes, they are there. Other scientists. Cooks. Clerks.\" \"How many people in total at the base?\" \"Two-Two hundred. Two hundred twenty, maybe.\" Kon folded his arms across his chest, processing the information from the trembling Sang Min. He figured they were facing at least a company of regular soldiers. Add to it maybe another three or four dozen manning the anti-aircraft systems. \"Are the support personnel armed?\" \"I think I saw a couple of them carrying pistols.\" Kon responded with a barely perceptible nod. So even the support troops are armed. But how many of them were proficient with pistols or rifles? They would also be slower to react than troops trained specifically for combat. \"What about the scientists? Are any of them armed?\" \"Not the ones I saw.\" That was good. They'd likely surrender the moment they saw a carbine aimed their way. One or two might try to be a hero. A three-round burst to the chest should discourage any others from doing the same. Twenty SEALs versus upwards of 220 people. They would have to strike fast with maximum violence and kill as many soldiers as possible to have any chance of success. He called over all his SEALs. They stood in a circle as he went over the plan for their assault. \"We would like to help if possible,\" Hyo said. \"You have already helped us with this information,\" said Kon. \"No, I mean we wish to join you in your attack on the complex. We all have the necessary training and experience for this. And with your team at half-strength, you will need all the extra bodies you can get.\" \"But what of your cover here in the North? It will be compromised if you join us.\" \"We know why that complex is so important. If it is not destroyed, the country we serve will no longer exist.\" Kon's face scrunched in thought. He didn't like the idea of adding four strangers to a group who had spent months, in some cases years, working and training together. But he couldn't argue with Hyo's logic. His unit was undermanned for this mission. The more guns at his disposal, the better. \"Very well. I accept your offer.\" Hyo, Lee and Shin, the lanky spy, joined the SEALs, while Min Ho, the muscular spy, watched the young North Korean private. After working out their plan, they gave Sang Min a fresh uniform and boarded the trucks. \"Please let me go,\" Sang Min begged Kon. \"I helped you. I did what you wanted. Please let me go.\" \"We can't. We need you to drive the truck to the complex. The guards will recognize you.\" \"I'll do it. I'll do it. Then will you let me go?\" Kon paused. \"Yes.\" Sang Min smiled. He scrambled into the driver's seat of the first truck, and waited for Kon to climb in before starting the engine. \"Don't try anything.\" Kon held up his SiG-Sauer P226 pistol, a suppressor attached to the barrel. \"I won't. I swear I won't.\" They drove onto the highway, the wipers fighting a losing battle against the rain pounding the windshield. No other traffic passed them. Hyo told them very few traveled on this road, especially at night. \"I don't like him, you know?\" Sang Min blurted. \"Who?\" \"Our Great Leader. I don't like him. Really, I don't. He is evil. He sent my aunt and uncle to a camp. I don't know if they're alive or dead. My mother and father, and my little sister, they starve. I starve! I deliver so much food to this place, but me and my friends, all we get are a few handfuls of rice or some watery broth. You should go to Pyongyang and kill him.\" \"Mm-hmm.\" Kon wondered if the young soldier said all that out of fear, or because he truly believed it. Maybe a combination of both. Not that it mattered to him. Sang Min said nothing else until the complex came into sight. Kon sat up straighter, peering through the heavy rain. A pair of guards stepped out of the little shack near the front gate. On either side of the entrance was a sandbagged machine gun nest. His heartbeat picked up. Kon took a few slow breaths, trying to settle down. \"Remember,\" he said in a low, menacing tone to Sang Min. \"Do nothing to arouse their suspicion.\" \"Uh-huh.\" The private nodded emphatically. One of the guards held up a hand. Sang Min slowed to a stop a couple feet from the gate. Kon watched the guard walk toward the driver's side door, while the other stood near the shack. \"What is it, Private?\" \"I have a delivery.\" Sang Min picked up a clipboard and handed it to the guard. Kon had no idea what was written on it. Hyo had given it to Sang Min before they headed here. The guard read over the papers, rain dripping off his helmet. Nothing in his body language indicated he was suspicious. \"Everything seems in order, except you are not scheduled to make a delivery at this time. I will have to alert the duty officer.\" The guard turned. Kon brought up his SiG-Sauer. Two muffled claps echoed through the cab. The .357 rounds tore through the base of the guard's neck, severing his spinal cord. He toppled forward, dead before he hit the ground. The second guard just stared at his fallen comrade, the shock evident on his face. Kon's first shot shattered the windshield. The next two caught the guard in the chest. \"GO! GO! GO!\" He heard the SEALs scrambling out the back. The North Koreans in the machine gun nests hollered and readied their weapons. Kon glanced at the rearview mirrors. Three spherical objects flew into the machine gun next on the right. He knew the scene would be repeated on his left side. Several sharp bangs rattled the air. Flashes of orange and red lit up the machine gun nests. \"Drive!\" he shouted at Sang Min. The private nodded and stomped on the gas. The truck rolled through the gate, followed by the second one. SEALs jogged alongside both vehicles. Several raised their carbines. A steady string of crackles filled the air. A squad of North Korean soldiers collapsed. Another soldier near an SA-6 SAM launcher fell against the flat chassis and slid to the ground. The distinct bang of a LAW anti-tank rocket pierced the sound of gunfire. Seconds later a ZSU-23 anti-aircraft vehicle erupted in flames. \"Turn left!\" Kon ordered Sang Min. The private twisted the wheel left. Kon watched the second truck speed toward the hangar-like building. A pair of North Korean soldiers ran out of the entrance, then stumbled and fell, no doubt shot down by one of the SEALs. The truck stopped in front of the entrance. Ten SEALs jumped out the back and stormed into the building, followed by the two in the cab. \"Stop!\" Sang Min stomped on the brake. Kon noticed an old truck carrying two SA-3 Goa missiles twenty-five feet away. A soldier stood by the bed, clutching a Type 56 rifle, head whipping to and fro. Kon holstered his pistol, threw open the door and brought up his K1 carbine. The North Korean soldier spotted him just as Kon squeezed the trigger. Three rounds nailed the soldier in the chest. He fell on his side. The passenger side door of the Goa launcher opened. Kon caught sight of a soldier running away, but didn't have a good shot at him. He turned back to Sang Min. \"Leave. Now.\" The private nodded, relief washing over his face. He turned his back to Kon and opened the door. Kon brought up his K1 and fired. Sang Min's head split in half, blood spraying in all directions. The young North Korean tumbled out of the cab and fell to the ground. A pang of guilt went through Kon. Any other time, he might have considered letting Sang Min go. But he couldn't take a chance on the young private running into his superiors and providing them details on his unit, or returning with a gun to fight them. He pushed Sang Min's death out of his head and jumped from the truck. He dashed across the complex, catching sight of Jung-Su, their sniper, climbing the ladder to the top of the water tower. One of the SEALs fired another LAW. An S-60 anti-aircraft gun turned into a fireball. The big spy, Min Ho, fired an RPG-7 at one of the troop barracks. The explosion tore through the thin metal wall of the Quonset hut-style building. Two SEALs, Dong-Sun and Nam-Kyu, rushed up to the barracks and used the grenade launchers attached under the barrels of their K1s to pump fragmentation and high-explosive rounds through the windows. A few North Koreans stumbled out of the doors, many in their underwear and sporting bloody wounds. Chung-Hee, the unit's machine gunner, cut them down with his K3. \"It appears we've killed all the sentries,\" Hyo reported as Kon approached him. \"Many of the SAM operators ran away when the shooting started.\" Kon nodded, then turned to the barracks. Smoke and flames gushed from the windows. Two North Koreans emerged from one of the barracks, hands over their mouths, coughing. Chung-Hee opened up with his K3. Both of them spun and dropped to the ground. \"Jung-Su,\" he radioed the sniper. \"Do you see any more enemy soldiers?\" \"Just a few scaling the fence to get away. No sign of any sentries. You are clear to the target.\" \"Roger.\" Kon looked to the others. \"Move!\" They hurried across the wet concrete, splashing through puddles. Kon swept his rifle left and right, alert for any threats. He almost couldn't believe that the gunfire had completely stopped. How long would it last? His gaze fell on the huge antennae fifty meters away. His chest tightened. That was it. That was what sent out signals that ordered Thulgira to destroy his country. Rage bubbled up inside him. How many friends and family had died because of that damn monster? How long would it take The Republic to recover? Could it ever fully recover? A vision of him putting a three-round burst into that SOB Barznav's head played in his mind. Why not? He could always tell his superiors the man pulled a gun on his and his SEALs. Barznav surely deserved die more than poor Private Sang Min. Kon suppressed those thoughts. Suppressed his anger. He couldn't afford them on a mission this – \"ZSU!\" Jung-Su voice exploded in his earpiece. \"Coming up on your left! Dammit, it was in a blind spot!\" Kon swung his head left. A squat tracked vehicle with a flat turret and four slender cannons rolled out from behind the corner of a building. \"DOWN! EVERYBODY DOWN!\" Kon dropped to his stomach. So did the other SEALs and Hyo's spies. Except Min Ho. He got on one knee and shouldered his RPG-7. A rapid-fire popping came from the ZSU-23's cannons. Tracers slashed through the rain. Kon tensed as cracks and zips filled the air above him. Min Ho's head and left shoulder vanished in a geyser of blood. The ravaged body toppled onto its back. The RPG clattered on the damp concrete. The ZSU-23 rolled forward. \"Dong-Sun! Nam-Kyu!\" Kon shouted into his radio. \"Put smoke grenades on the ZSU approaching our position!\" \"Yes, Sir,\" they both replied. He glanced to his right and spotted the two grenadiers dashing toward them. He gritted his teeth, hoping the rain and the dark obscured the vision of the ZSU-23 crew. Though if they were using night vision devices . . . Dong-Sun and Nam-Kyu both dropped to one knee. Soft pops came from their grenade launchers. Two orange flashes erupted on the quad-mounted 23mm cannons. A cloud of thick smoke blotted out the turret. The ZSU-23 rolled to a stop. Kon scrambled to his feet and hurried over to Min Ho's corpse. He grabbed the fallen RPG-7 and hefted it on his shoulder. The loud BANG drilled into his skull. An orange flare burned a few feet in front of him as the projectile's internal rocket ignited. It shot through the darkness. A gusher of flames tore through the smoke-shrouded turret. Bright orange sparks exploded from the ZSU-23 as its ammunition cooked off. Kon dropped the RPG-7 and ordered everyone forward. Once they reached the antenna, he and several other SEALs pulled out blocks of C4 and attached them to the supports. After sticking in the blasting caps, the SEALs and spies retreated behind a sheet metal building 120 meters away. Kon pulled out the detonator and flipped a switch. \"Detonator armed.\" He took a quick breath. \"Fire in the hole!\" His thumb mashed the red button. Loud, sharp crashes shook the air. Red and orange fireballs consumed the base of the antenna. A loud, grinding sound covered the entire complex. The antenna fell forward, and kept falling until it slammed into the ground. Tremors raced under Kon's feet. Several of the SEALs let out a cheer. Kon wanted to as well, but decided it would not be the appropriate thing for a senior officer to do. Besides, only one part of the mission was completed. His thoughts turned further south, to Lieutenant Commander Jim Rice. It is up to you now, my friend. TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 11] Barznav gawked at the screen in front of him. A flat line represented the signal that controlled Thulgira. This can't be. He pressed buttons and flicked switches over and over again. Come on. Work, dammit. Work! The line remained flat. I . . . I can't control Thulgira. He barely heard General Sang shout out orders. He barely heard the distant pops and thuds filtering through the steel door. Barznav just stared at the screen dumbfounded. His hands trembled. He had to correct this. His greatest achievement could not end like this. He furiously stabbed at the buttons on his console. \"Work . . . work . . . work, damn y-\" A horrendous crash rocked the control bunker. Barznav pressed his hands over his ears and tumbled off the chair. Several others screamed in pain and fear. Short, sharp crackles split the air. He rolled onto his back. The guards twisted around and fell, patches of blood on their tunics and faces. A group of heavily armed, black-clad men rushed through the smoking remains of the door and into the bunker. General Sang fumbled for his pistol. One of the intruders raised a rifle and fired. Sang stumbled into a nearby console and collapsed to the floor. Gobs of blood stained his chest. \"ON THE FLOOR! EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR! MOVE AND YOU DIE!\" Barznav's entire body quaked. Fear squeezed his chest tight. His skin grew cold. What's happening? I don't want to die. One of the intruders stalked toward Barznav. His shaking grew worse. The man stared at him, tilted his head, then glanced at something on the bottom of his right forearm. Was that a photograph? \"You are Doctor Uldis Barznav?\" \"Y-Y-Yes. Who-Who are you?\" The man scowled at him, then shouted, \"I have him! Target secure!\" He then said in a more normal tone, \"Orca Five. Thinking Cap in good hands. Repeat, Thinking Cap in good hands.\" Barznav held his breath as the intruder reached down for him. \"Get up.\" The man yanked him to his feet with one hand and threw him against the console. \"Please don't kill me.\" The intruder's face hardened. Barznav took a shaky breath as the rifle barrel hovered inches from his face. \"I should. After all the death and destruction you caused, I would be doing everyone in my country a favor by putting a bullet through your miserable skull.\" \"I-I-I . . . I've done nothing.\" \"That is a lie! We know about your background. We know you conducted cutting edge animal experiments for the KGB during the Cold War. It had to be you controlling Thulgira.\" A wicked smile traced over his lips. \"Thankfully, we have made sure you can never do that again.\" Barznav's eyes widened. \"It was you. You cut off my signal.\" The intruder nodded. \"My friends outside brought your control tower down a few minutes ago. Who knows? Without you to guide it, Thulgira might actually destroy your forces instead of ours.\" Barznav's breathing increased. His shoulders rose and fell. Anger burned through his fear. They destroyed the tower. My achievements. My dreams. They destroyed them. I could have ruled the world, but they . . . they . . . \"You fool! You shit-sucking son-of-a-whore! Do you realize what you've done!\" \"I have hopefully saved my country from destruction.\" \"To hell with your country!\" Barznav raged. \"I spit on your miserable country! South Korea lies in rubble because of me!\" He pounded his chest with a fist. \"I did that! I controlled the greatest destructive force mankind has ever known.\" He turned and pointed across the bunker to a clear plastic container with several wires. Inside it was a red glowing object. \"That! That little stone made me the most powerful man in the world! Nobody else could unlock its secret. Fifteen years the imbeciles in this country tried after they found Thulgira in a cavern near here. Then they brought me in, and paid me more money than you will ever see in your miserable life! I learned Thulgira was created by an ancient civilization to wage war on another. I learned how to bypass the psychic link of the stone and generate the proper harmonics through artificial means. Me! Uldis Barznav! Who are you to interfere with my genius! Who are you to -\" The intruder whirled his gun around. The butt slammed into Barznav's gut. Pain exploded through his body. All the air shot from his lungs. He wheezed and sank to his knees, hands over his ample stomach. \"I am just a man defending his country from scum like you.\" \"In-Su.\" Another intruder came up to the one that struck Barznav. \"The bunker his secure. Six enemy dead, four wounded and twenty-six prisoners total.\" \"Good. Put them with the other prisoners in the second floor mess hall.\" \"Right away.\" Barznav opened his mouth, expecting to throw up. Instead he had the dry heaves. The pain still crushed his stomach. \"Orca Five,\" In-Su said, probably into a radio. \"We have positive ID on Thinking Cap's steering wheel. He used the same thing your American friend has on his pendant . . . Yes, I am sure . . . Understood. We'll begin placing our charges. Oh, they also have a monitor in here that appears to have a feed from the Big Ugly Bastard.\" Barznav grimaced from both pain and anger. Is that what they called Thulgira? Big Ugly Bastard? You should be terrified of him, not make jokes about him. \"Right now he seems to be stomping around just outside some city,\" In-Su reported. \"Yes, Sir. Hopefully our Big Friend can deal with him this time.\" Big friend? Barznav's shoulders and chest tensed. Did he mean Gamera? All his muscles froze when the realization hit him. \"He used the same thing your American friend has on his pendant.\" Did that mean they had someone controlling Gamera? Could Thulgira win without being under his control? Barznav looked up at In-Su, gritting his teeth. \"You ruined everything!\" \"Good.\" In-Su rammed a boot into his side. XXXXX Electricity crackled through Rice as he watched Thulgira roar and stomp around the outskirts of Changwon. \"Well, nice to see something actually went our way in this war,\" said Soto. Thulgira's tail whipped around. Several buildings collapsed and kicked up huge clouds of dust. \"It ain't over yet.\" Rice clutched the pendant and closed his eyes. We're ready. Take him out. I am on my way, Gamera replied. Again, his vision wavered back and forth from the panoramic view of Changwon to water all around him. Suddenly he heard and felt a tremendous splash. Half his vision became a whirlwind of fire. Gamera was coming. At the speed he flew, it should only take a few minutes before he reached – \"Commander, we have company.\" Mongkut reported. \"Who?\" \"A single KM450.\" Rice chewed on his lip. The KM450 was the standard light utility truck of the ROK army. What would one be doing up here? CFC had restricted all military activity on Mount Bulmo, save for him and his SEALs. He thought back to the supposed South Korean soldiers on the bridge at the Geum River. Aw crap, not again. Did the North Koreans know about them? Did they know he controlled Gamera? How could that be possible? Or maybe they were here for a different purpose. This part of Mount Bulmo provided a commanding view of Changwon. It would be a good place for an observation post for an invading army. How and why didn't matter. All that mattered was another group of Special Purpose Forces in disguise were headed here. Rice couldn't afford to have them tramping around. \"Myung-Dae.\" He turned to their Korean liaison. \"Looks like we got some more infiltrators.\" \"I agree.\" \"Take Warthan and Engle with you and set up an ambush. Keep those bastards away from Soto and me. It's your show, Lieutenant.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Myung-Dae nodded, then stared at Warthan and Engle. Rice also stared at the Senior Chief and the unit's medic. The resolve on both their faces was clear. They accepted Myung-Dae as their leader, no questions asked. It didn't surprise him too much. Myung-Dae had been with them night and day for well over a week. He'd proven himself in combat. He was no longer a stranger. He'd become one of them. \"Good luck, guys.\" Rice nodded to them. \"Same to you, Sir.\" Warthan slapped him on the shoulder before he, Engle and Myung-Dae slithered away. \"Hey, Sir.\" Soto aimed his gaze to the night sky. \"I think the party's about to start.\" Rice didn't need to look up. He saw/felt Gamera diving toward Changwon, spinning in a fiery blur. Thulgira continued to trample entire blocks of the city. He looked up seconds before Gamera crashed into him. Thulgira's arms flew back. He crashed onto an already smashed neighborhood. Enormous dust clouds surrounded him. Gamera leveled off, arms, legs and head emerging from his shell. He stood near Thulgira and unleashed an earth-shattering roar. \"Get him!\" Rice said through clenched teeth. Gamera charged forward. Thulgira started to get to his feet when the giant turtle ran into him. Thulgira rolled over, crushing buildings and trees. Gamera roared again. He grabbed Thulgira's frill. Rice felt all his muscles strain as Gamera lifted Thulgira, them slammed him into the ground. Even from this distance he felt the tremors. Another cloud of dust obscured his view. He closed his eyes, looking through Gamera's eyes. The turtle rained blow after blow on Thulgira's head. The monster roared and swung its head back and forth. One of the horns cut across Gamera's leg. He roared. Rice gritted his teeth, feeling a bolt of fire sear his right leg. Thulgira got up and swung a massive arm. It struck Gamera under the chin, snapping his head back. And Rice's as well. \"You okay, Sir?\" asked Soto. \"Fine,\" he answered in a strained voice, his skull vibrating. Thulgira lashed out with his arm again. His claws raked Gamera's torso. Fiery needles dragged down Rice's chest. No way, dammit. You are not beating me again. You're not beating us again. Thulgira's arm reared back, ready for another blow. Wait for it. The monster roared and swung its arm down. NOW! Gamera opened his mouth. He caught Thulgira's arm in his jaws and bit down. Thulgira let out a sustained, painful roar. Again all of Rice's muscles tensed. Thulgira pulled and shook his right arm. He punched and clawed Gamera's head with his free arm. Do not let go. Do not . . . let . . . go. Gunfire erupted far behind him. Myung-Dae and his SEALs springing their ambush. He hoped it was that, and not the North Koreans gunning them down. I can't think about that now. Rice felt his molars about to crack he bit down so hard. But he had to reach down, summon every ounce of strength so . . . he . . . could . . . Gamera twisted his head to the left. SNAP! Rice flinched when the sickening sound reached his ears. Even Soto grimaced. Thulgira stumbled backwards, his roars more high-pitched, more tortured. Now let's finish him off. Gamera opened his mouth wide. A red glow came from inside. Rice felt his own throat grow blazing hot. A fireball shot from Gamera's mouth. It exploded against Thulgira's hide. The monster thrashed about, flames and smoke covering him. Yet it did not go down. \"Oh for piss sake,\" Soto blurted. \"What does it take to kill this thing?\" Rice didn't answer. He still couldn't get over the shock. He sensed through Gamera that the fireballs easily destroyed the Gyaos. Obviously, whoever created Thulgira made him a lot tougher than those monster birds. That was demonstrated by the fact Thulgira, still smoldering, lowered its head and charged Gamera. I hate those damn horns. That's when the idea struck him. He had Gamera step to the side. Thulgira tried to stop when he realized he was going to miss. Gamera reached out and grabbed both of the large horns. He turned Thulgira toward him and pushed back the monster's head. It sent a laser blast from its horns. The beam shot harmlessly into the sky. Rice grunted. Damn, it felt like his hands had burst into flames. More gunfire and a couple of explosions echoed behind him. Distant voices filtered through his radio. \"They're trying to outflank us!\" \"Someone take out that machine gun!\" \"Engle's hit! Engle's hit!\" Rice's chest tightened. Engle! Oh God, how bad was he hit? Thulgira fired another laser blast. Rice's hands felt like he laid them on an oven. Don't let go. Fight the pain. Fight the pain. He flexed his muscles. Gamera flexed his muscles. They pulled . . . pulled . . . pulled . . . A crunch and a snap carried across the entire city. Gamera flung his arms out to his sides. He roared and held up his hands, each one holding the horns he'd torn off Thulgira's head. Thulgira cried out and thrashed around. He pawed at his face, as though desperately searching for the horns that were no longer there. I got an idea. He could see Gamera nod in the distance. The turtle dropped the horn in his left arm and advanced on Thulgira. The monster continued to wail and stamp its feet. Gamera reached out and grabbed Thulgira by the horn on its snout. It struggled to break the hold. Gamera would not let go. With a mighty roar, Gamera reared back his right hand, then swung it forward. The horn pierced Thulgira's left eye. Rice clenched his teeth and scalding fists. He willed Gamera to push the horn deeper into Thulgira, through its brain, and out the other side of its head. Gamera stepped back. Rice stared at Thulgira through the giant turtle's eyes. The monster stood statue still. Not so much as a hiss came from its mouth. Like a freshly cut tree, it fell, crashing onto its back. It lay still, Gamera/Rice watched it, just in case it showed any sign of stirring. Thulgira did not move at all. It's dead. Rice gaped at the scene. Had they really killed Thulgira? \"Yeah!\" Soto cheered and pumped a fist, abandoning all discipline. \"You did it, Sir! You did it!\" He slapped Rice on the back. \"That big som'bitch is dead!\" Rice responded with a disbelieving laugh. \"Yeah. Oh my God, yeah.\" Another sound spread throughout the city. Some sort of rumble? No, that wasn't right. It sounded like . . . Cheering? It was. The residents who moments before had been fleeing for their lives now celebrated the death of the monster that had destroyed so much of their country. \"We did it!\" Rice hollered and threw an arm around Soto's shoulders. \"We did it, man!\" \"Yeah! Friggin A!\" Gamera threw back his head and let out a triumphant roar. Rice drew a quick breath. He brought up his hands to his face. They didn't burn any more. His chest and leg also felt fine. He looked up and saw Gamera turning in his direction. He gave the big turtle a thumbs up. We did it, buddy. Yes, we did it. The cheering from Changwon grew louder. Suddenly another sound overwhelmed it. Jet engines. Rice looked up. Squadrons of MiGs roared overhead. He then saw them through Gamera's eyes. Something moved in his peripheral vision. Gamera/Rice turned. Rows of armored vehicles rolled toward Changwon. Tanks and armored vehicles and trucks and self-propelled artillery. All old and Soviet-made. All North Korean. All on their own with their ultimate weapon lying on the ground with a horn shoved through its head. Gamera turned to the approaching North Korean armored division and roared. A smile grew on Rice's face. \"Sic 'em, boy.\" TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 12] The Great Leader sat behind his desk, silently staring at the wall. He still had trouble accepting the news from his National Defense Commission. He had screamed at the generals and ministers to confirm it. They had. He still didn't want to believe it. Thulgira was dead, killed by the damn giant turtle. Even worse, the 4th Army Corps, which had been poised to take control of Changwon, had been completely destroyed by Gamera. Barznav said Thulgira was invincible. He lied to me. He lied to me! The Great Leader had attempted to contact General Sang and order him to arrest and execute the incompetent Latvian. But all communications with the complex at Kaesong had been cut off. One of the phones on his desk rang. He let it ring four times before picking it up. \"Yes?\" He tried unsuccessfully to sound confident. \"Great Leader.\" It was General Ri, Chief of the Korean People's Army General Staff. \"We have just received word that Gamera has commenced an attack on the Eighth Army Corps near Kwangju. We have dispatched fighter-bombers to support them, but . . . but Gamera destroyed all our aircraft over Changwon. I'm not . . . not sure . . .\" The Great Leader hung up the phone and returned to staring at the wall. Another army corps was going to be destroyed by Gamera. Then more than likely another, and another, until he had no army left. He had seen Thulgira decimate all the South Korean and American military forces in its path. If Gamera was powerful enough to kill Thulgira, what chance did the People's Army have? The war is lost. Tremors gripped his body. If the imperialists had control of Gamera, as some on the National Defense Commission feared, they would surely use the beast to exact revenge for all the destruction caused by Thulgira. They would not stop until every square inch of the People's Republic was reduced to ash. And he had no way to prevent it. Or do I? Despite Thulgira's rampage, the weaklings in the South refused to allow the Americans to use their most powerful weapons for fear they would win the war, but irradiate a sizeable portion of the South in the process. Such concerns did not matter at all to him. The Great Leader picked up another phone, this one a direct line to General Choe, the commander of the Missile Guidance Bureau. He ordered him to use his special weapons on Gamera. \"Of course, Great Leader, but . . . but . . .\" \"But what?\" \"Well, it is just the weapons are strategic in nature, and Gamera is a mobile target. Even if we do have his location, by the time we program the coordinates into the guidance system and launch the missile, he will likely have moved on somewhere else. We . . . we will be wasting a missile, and American cruise missiles and high-altitude bomber attacks have reduced our inventory to just six missiles.\" The Great Leader's head shook with rage. He opened his mouth, ready to scream at Choe, then stopped himself. What good would it do to fire one of his precious special weapons at the damn turtle if it wouldn't be around when it hit? Another storm of fury swept through him. All those years, all the money and resources he put into this program to make the People's Republic a nation to be reckoned with, and it was all useless! No. I can still use them. A smile grew on his face. The imperialists may win this war, but he could make certain their victory would be a pyrrhic one. \"General Choe. How many missiles did you say are left in our arsenal?\" \"Six, Great Leader.\" \"Launch them.\" XXXXX Rice \"watched\" Gamera crush a pair of North Korean T-55 tanks beneath his feet when Soto informed him Commander Kon was on the radio. \"Good job up there, buddy. We've got good news to report from Changwon. Thulgira's dead.\" \"We know,\" Kon replied. \"We saw it on one of the monitors here. It appears the North Koreans implanted cameras in Thulgira's eyes to keep track of it. We also found the source of Doctor Barznav's control over the monster. It was a stone, similar to the one you have.\" Rice's jaw slowly fell open in astonishment. \"You're sure about that?\" \"Yes.\" \"So was he actually linked to Thulgira?\" \"No. It appears he manipulated the stone's . . . energy, I guess, through artificial means. We persuaded the Doctor to help us examine the stone. Whatever energy it possessed, it seems to have faded completely after Thulgira's death.\" \"Well that's good to hear.\" At least no one else could use it to control any other giant monsters lurking elsewhere in the world. \"I agree,\" Kon responded. \"You did a good job, Commander, both you and Gamera.\" \"Thanks.\" Rice felt a couple tiny pricks on his chest. North Korean artillery had scored a few hits on Gamera. A couple fireballs silenced those big guns permanently. \"What is Gamera doing now?\" Kon asked. \"Barbecuing an entire corps of North Korean soldiers.\" \"Good. Keep it up.\" \"I intend to.\" Rice bit his lip for a moment. \"How did your guys come through up there?\" Kon sighed briefly. \"Two dead. One of my SEALs, and one of the contacts who accompanied us. I also have three wounded, but none seriously. You?\" Rice's stomach turned into a lead ball. He forced down the lump forming in his throat. \"One KIA.\" He still found it hard to believe Stuart Engle was dead. How many hairy situations had they been in over the past year? Engle had gotten out of them with at worst a few nasty cuts. But here on a Korean mountaintop, two rounds in the chest and . . . He closed his eyes, trying to regroup. You'll have time to mourn later. \"How do you guys plan on getting out of there?\" Rice had already been informed of Dodko's loss. \"We've radioed the George Washington. She's sending some of her helicopters to extract us. It will take them a few hours to reach us, so we'll . . . one moment, Commander.\" Rice heard something shuffle over the earpiece. Maybe Kon put the receiver against his chest. Still he heard what sounded like low voices, though he couldn't make out what they were saying. \"Commander, we have a problem. Our sniper just spotted an armored force heading our way.\" \"How big?\" \"Four APCs. A reconnaissance unit, most likely.\" \"Which means there's gotta be a bigger force just behind them,\" Rice said. \"You guys better lay low until those helos get there.\" \"That might be difficult. We caused much damage at the base. When the recon unit sees it, they'll call in the main force. Even if we head into the forest, they'll no doubt search it, and I do not like our chances of staying out of sight until the helicopters arrive.\" Rice's jaw tightened. Even if the choppers got there, the North Koreans would probably blast them out of the sky, and Kon's men would be in deeper crap than they were already. There had to be a faster way to . . . He looked through Gamera's eyes again, watching hundreds of North Korean soldiers fleeing before him. \"Kon, don't worry. We've got a faster way to get you and your guys out of there.\" \"How?\" \"My big buddy.\" Kon paused. \"Are you sure about that?\" \"If you've got a better suggestion, I'm all ears.\" \"I don't. But the sooner we leave this place, the better. I'll prepare my men.\" \"Good.\" Rice nodded. \"We should be there in a half-hour, maybe less. Just hold on till then.\" \"We will, Commander. Thank you.\" \"No problem. I'll see you soon. Out.\" He handed the receiver back to Soto and linked in with Gamera. I need you back here. We need to rescue some friends of mine. Your human enemies here have been defeated, Gamera replied. I will come to you. Rice looked around at his SEALs. \"All right, guys. When Gamera gets here, we're gonna take a little trip up to Kaesong and get Kon's men out of there.\" \"You mean we're actually gonna fly on Gamera?\" Candaele's eyes widened. \"That's the plan.\" \"I assume Gamera will be carrying us as he flies,\" said Myung-Dae. \"Will that be safe?\" The corners of Rice's mouth twisted. Damn. He hadn't thought of that. Gamera could fly in excess of Mach One, far in excess of it. Even at a few hundred miles per hour, could they really hold on to the turtle without getting blown off? Maybe he can cover us with his hands. Which, of course, held the risk of accidentally getting crushed. No, what they needed was some kind of container that Gamera could easily carry and that could protect them from the buffeting winds. A thought struck Rice. He focused on the alluvial plain beyond Changwon, where the US and ROK forces were located. Would something like that work? It would have to. Right now he didn't have any other choice. \"Okay.\" He turned back to the SEALs. \"This is what we're gonna -\" \"Sir!\" Soto blurted. \"Urgent message from CFC. General Taylor wants to talk to you now.\" Rice furrowed his brow. Why would General Taylor want to talk to him? To congratulate him for killing Thulgira? No, saying, \"Good job, son,\" did not sound like something a general would consider urgent. He took the receiver from Soto. \"This is Venom Six. Go.\" \"Commander Rice, it's General Taylor. We just got an alert from NORAD. The North Koreans just launched six ballistic missiles.\" \"What?\" Rice gaped. \"You heard me. Tell your comm specialist we're sending him a link from NORAD showing the missile tracks.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" He told this to Soto. Even the black camo paint couldn't completely hide the shock on his face. \"Oh my God,\" Candaele said in a hushed voice as a digital image of Korea and Japan appeared on Soto's screen. \"Crazy sons'a bitches.\" Warthan shook his head. Myung-Dae stood statue still, his eyes locked on the screen. Rice held his breath as he stared at the missile tracks. The readouts below them gave their altitude, estimated speed, and for three tracks, their projected targets. One was for Changwon. The other two were for Pusan. \"Commander,\" Taylor's voice burst from the earpiece. \"We need you to have Gamera destroy those missiles. We have to assume they're carrying nukes, or maybe chemical or bio weapons. If even one of them hits their target, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands, maybe even a million casualties.\" Rice gripped the phone so hard it shook. He thought of Kon, waiting to be whisked away from Kaesong with the rest of his men. If he didn't get to them soon, they could be facing an entire division of North Korean troops. What chance would they have then? What chance do the people of Changwon and Pusan have if Gamera doesn't shoot down those missiles? Over a million people lived in Changwon. Pusan had over three-and-a-half million. Throw in the refugees that fled to both cities and those figures increased by two or three times. He cursed himself for his decision. He'd already lost one friend today. Now he'd likely lose another. But what choice do I have? \"Commander!\" Taylor practically shouted. \"Gamera's on the way, Sir. We'll knock out those missiles.\" \"Roger that, Commander. Get to it.\" \"Yes, Sir. Venom Six, out.\" Rice lowered the receiver and closed his eyes. Change of plans, buddy. We've got some missiles to shoot down. Guide me to them, and I will destroy them. He looked at the feed from NORAD. Three of the missiles had reached their apogees and arced over, racing toward Changwon and Pusan. The other three missiles headed out over the Sea of Japan. Could Japan be their target? Keep going straight. Climb. He felt Gamera rise, flying faster, his eyes scanning the night sky for the telltale glow of exhaust from the missiles. \"Soto. Get Kon back on the line.\" Rice watched Gamera's progress as he took the receiver from Soto. \"What is it, Commander?\" Kon asked. \"Kon.\" His jaw tightened for a moment. \"I'm sorry. We won't be able to come and get you.\" He quickly told him about the ballistic missiles headed toward Changwon and Pusan. \"Forget about us,\" Kon told him. \"Destroying those missiles is the only thing that matters right now.\" \"Understood. Hold out best you can. As soon as we're done here, we'll head your way.\" \"We'll be fine. Concentrate on those missiles.\" \"Roger that. Out.\" Rice bit his lip. He seriously doubted Kon and his men would be fine. But the Korean SEAL was right. The missiles took priority over everything else. I see them, he heard Gamera's thoughts. Rice felt his consciousness jump fully into the giant turtle. Three red glows soared through the sky, two of them further away than the third. The trailing missile had to be for Changwon. Faster. Faster. He felt the screaming wind smash into his face. He/they closed with the missiles. Not quickly enough. Damn adrenaline was slowing down the world around him. Rice had Gamera bank to the right and descend, trying to keep track of the missile. Aiming proved difficult, with one high-speed object trying to shoot down another without any sort of electronic aid. It definitely was not like trying to shoot a moving target from five hundred yards away. The missile moved a hell of a lot faster than a person or a vehicle. Forget precision. He'd have to do it the old-fashioned way, like the submariners back in World War II. Fire a spread and hope at least one shot hit the target. Though instead of torpedoes, he had fireballs at his disposal. The missile plunged toward the ground. Out the corner of his eye, Rice/Gamera made out the shadowy cityscape of Changwon. They didn't have much time, especially if the warhead was set for an airburst. Now. Gamera spat out one fireball after another, his head moving back and forth. Rice's heart slammed into his chest as he watched them blaze across the sky. Three fireballs missed far behind the missile. No. No. No. Rice glanced back at Changwon. The missile was almost two miles above the city. They didn't have much time left. More fireballs shot from Gamera's mouth. Miss. Miss. Miss. Rice felt sweat break out all over his body. Two miles and – A fiery cloud erupted in front of him. Tendrils of sparks and flame shot out from the destroyed missile. He let out a long, relieved breath. One down. Five more to go. Gamera banked further to the right and rocketed south. The plumes of the two missiles bound for Pusan stood out clearly in the night sky. Both were already plummeting toward the city. Rice felt more energy surge through Gamera, pouring out the openings – exhausts – in his rear. A sharp crack filled the air around them. For a split-second, Rice worried one of the missiles had detonated. Then he realized the turtle had set off a sonic boom. They closed with the missiles. Again Gamera belched out fireballs, his head moving left to right, up and down. One of the missiles exploded. Gamera continued to unleash a barrage of fireballs. The second missile exploded. Rice pulled out of his link with Gamera. He found himself back on Mount Bulmo, staring at the feed from NORAD. The remaining three missiles continued their path over the Sea of Japan. A projected target was listed beneath two of them. Tokyo. He checked the last track. It headed further north, toward Hokkaido. Could its target be Sapporo, the capital of that prefecture? \"Soto. I'm going after the Tokyo missiles. Sing out the moment NORAD confirms a target for that last missile.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Gamera retracted his head and forearms. Flames burst from all his exhausts. He spun around in what many called \"flying saucer mode\" and blazed across the sky, headed east. A trail of sonic booms erupted above the Sea of Japan. Rice gritted his teeth. Despite Gamera's constant spinning, he could still focus straight ahead. Rice had no idea how that was possible. Right now he didn't care. The sonic booms continued. My God, how fast were they going? Mach Two? Mach Three? As fast as an SR-71 Blackbird? Even faster? Whatever their speed, it didn't take long for the western coast of Japan to come into view. In the distance, he spotted the exhausts of the missiles headed for Tokyo. Faster. His entire body tensed. Or could that be Gamera's body, straining from flying far beyond the speed of sound. How long could he keep it up? However long it takes. The missiles drew closer. Gamera stopped spinning, his head and forearms emerging as they switched to conventional flight mode. To the east a mass of lights stretched across the horizon. It had to be Tokyo. Had the civil defense people warned them about the inbound missiles? Were the residents taking shelter? Were they panicking? Gamera launched a spread of fireballs. All of them missed their targets. Rice clenched his fists, willing more energy into Gamera's \"engines.\" The missiles grew steadily larger as they descended toward the great metropolis. Another barrage of fireballs streaked through the sky. One of the missiles exploded, fiery debris raining down to the ground. The other missile barreled toward Tokyo. More fireballs shot from Gamera's mouth. All of them missed. Rice wanted to shout out a curse. He stifled it. Getting mad wouldn't stop this missile. Gamera launched more fireballs. The second missile exploded. \"Yes!\" He felt himself pump his fist. \"Sir,\" a distant voice called to him. \"Sir.\" Rice felt his forehead scrunch. Who was that? The voice sounded familiar. \"Sir!\" This time it sounded like someone shouted in his ear. Rice found himself back on Mount Bulmo, Soto staring at him. \"What!\" \"I've been trying to get your attention for a few minutes. Man, you were zoned out.\" \"Sorry. What is it?\" \"It's the last missile. NORAD confirmed its target. It's Anchorage.\" Soto's words hit him like a blow to the gut. For a second, he didn't believe it. A nuke actually headed for his country? This wasn't some Tom Clancy or Dale Brown novel. This was real! An honest-to-God nuclear missile was going to hit US soil. Not if I can help it. Rice checked the missile track. It was currently over the Kuril Islands, headed northeast. He jumped back into Gamera's consciousness. Step on it, buddy! We've got one more missile to take out. I am weakening. Rice's jaw clenched. He'd been afraid of this. As big and powerful as Gamera was, there had to be a limit on how long he could continue flying at these great speeds. He thought of Anchorage, of the 300,000 people who lived there. He thought of the little bastard in Pyongyang who ordered that missile launched at his country. We can rest later. Right now we've got a job to do. There was a pause. Rice feared Gamera would tell him no. The fear, it turned out, was unfounded. We will do it. Gamera went back to flying saucer mode. Patches of light below from Japanese cities passed by in a blur. Soon they found themselves above the Pacific Ocean. Rice felt his eyes begin to burn and his eyelids grow heavy. Gamera's fatigue started to affect him. So what? Just like Hell Week. He thought back to that part of BUD/S in which the sadistic instructors subjected him and the other trainees to constant running and swimming and all sorts of other physical activity. Most days they operated on two or three hours of sleep, if they were lucky. Half the time he'd been dead on his feet. But he made it through. He'd make it through this time as well. Push through it. Ignore the fatigue. The mind is more powerful than the body. Rice felt a bump within his body. Did Gamera just increase his speed? Silhouettes of tiny bumps stuck out in the distance. Could those be the Aleutian Islands? There! He spotted the plume from the last missile. It had to be one of those Taepodong-2s. They were the only missiles North Korea had with a range of more than 3,000 miles. They also had a reputation for being very inaccurate. Even if Gamera couldn't shoot it down, it would probably fall into the sea instead of hitting Anchorage. Yeah, like I really want to take that chance. Rice's eyes locked on the missile. When he felt it was close enough, he had Gamera switch to conventional flight mode. Half-a-dozen fireballs shot across the sky. Oh no friggin' way are you hitting my country. Gamera spat more fireballs. They didn't feel as intense as the ones back in South Korea or Japan. How many had they fired? How much of an added strain would that be on Gamera? Rice pushed it from his mind. They wouldn't stop firing until – One of the fireballs slammed into the missile. A brilliant orange and red flash lit up the sky. Rice didn't cheer. Instead he felt himself fall onto his back. The other SEALs grouped around him, asking if he was all right. \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" He waved them off and pushed himself up. He could feel Gamera's desire to land on the nearest island and rest. Hell, he'd like nothing more than to rest. We're not done yet. We still have to go back for Commander Kon. Gamera did not respond. I know you're tired. I know you want to rest. But I know it's your duty to protect humanity. It's our duty. Kon and his men risked everything to knock out the signal controlling Thulgira. We owe it to them to save them. Silence for one second. Two seconds. You are right. We will save them. Gamera reverted to flying saucer mode, streaking back toward Korea as fast as possible. Rice shook off his fatigue, and Gamera's. They couldn't afford to be tired right now. Kon's life, and the lives of his SEALs, depended on it. TO BE CONTINUED AUTHOR'S NOTES: APC – Armored Personnel Carrier NORAD – North American Air Defense Command. Military command charged with protecting the airspace of the US and Canada. They can detect ballistic missile launches anywhere on the planet.[Chapter 13] Rice's muscles felt leaden. He had to concentrate to keep his eyelids open. Gamera's fatigue had become his fatigue. Yet Rice's determination to persevere became Gamera's determination. Through his link, he \"saw\" that the giant turtle had left behind the Japanese coast and sped over the Sea of Japan. It wouldn't be long before he reached Changwon. Thumping rotors caught his attention. Rice looked up from behind the trees he and his men used for cover. A helicopter with a round fuselage and stubby nose settled over the clearing and descended. As soon as its skids touched the ground, Rice and the other SEALs darted out from behind the trees, running past the IR markers they set out to help guide the South Korean Huey. They scrambled onto the chopper. Rice made for the flight deck, taking Myung-Dae with him so he could translate. \"Take us to the plain northeast of the city.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The pilot nodded. The Huey's engines roared louder and lifted off into the darkened sky. Rice propped himself up against the cabin, fighting to stay awake. He looked over to the rear of the cabin, where Engle's body had been secured. Sorry, Stuart. He gritted his teeth. This wasn't the first time he'd lost men in combat. Many officers through the years told him losses came with the job. How could they not, given their line of work? That still didn't make it any easier to deal with. That still didn't stop him from blaming himself. Could he have trained Engle harder, given him more advice? Is there really anything you could have done to prevent this? Logically, he knew the answer was no. Not that logic meant much when staring at a corpse that only a few hours ago had been a teammate, a friend. It didn't take long for the Huey to fly over Changwon and land in a clearing on the alluvial plain. Rice exited the chopper with the others and scanned the area. Vehicles of all sizes and types, along with thousands of American and South Korean soldiers, were spread out along the plain. About sixty yards away he spotted a group of M-113 armored personnel carriers. Just what he needed. He rushed over to a group of South Koreans milling near the vehicles. \"Who's in charge here?\" he asked, with Myung-Dae translating. \"That would be Colonel Du-Ho,\" answered one of the soldiers. \"I need to speak with him ASAP.\" The soldier nodded and hurried off. A few minutes later a short, stocky man appeared. Rice and his SEALs saluted. \"Sir, Lieutenant Commander Jim Rice, US Navy SEALs.\" Myung-Dae started to translate, but Du-Ho informed him that he could speak English.\" \"What is it you want, Commander?\" \"Sir, we need to borrow two of your M-113s.\" Du-Ho cranked an eyebrow. \"Borrow two of my M-113s? You speak of them as if they were the family car.\" \"It's important we have them, Sir. For a rescue mission.\" \"It is also important that I have them should the North Koreans attack.\" \"With all due respect, Colonel, we have to have those vehicles.\" Du-Ho's face hardened. \"And whose authority do you have to make such a request?\" At that exact moment, a high-pitched whirring sound came from above. Everyone looked up as Gamera appeared overhead. The giant turtle switched to conventional flight mode and landed just beyond the alluvial plain. He stared directly at Rice and Du-Ho and let out an ear-piercing roar. Rice turned back to the South Korean colonel and answered his question with one word. \"His.\" He jerked a thumb in Gamera's direction to emphasize the point. Du-Ho just stared at the turtle, the veins in his neck sticking out. He then looked to Rice. \"Take whatever vehicles you want.\" \"Thank you, Sir.\" Rice tacked on a smile as he led the SEALs toward two of the M-113s. The crews of both vehicles stood in front of them, gawking at Gamera. When Rice informed them they and their M-113s were now under their control, the South Koreans looked to Du-Ho, who simply nodded. Warthan, Candaele and Mongkut boarded one vehicle, while Rice, Myung-Dae and Soto entered the other. \"What are your orders, Sir?\" asked the vehicle commander, a buck sergeant named Jin-Sang. \"I want you and the other APC to drive up to Gamera.\" Jin-Sang and the driver, a young private named Kwang Ho, stared at him as though he'd lost his mind. \"Don't worry. He's not gonna hurt you. Hell, you saw what he did to Thulgira. He's on our side. Trust me.\" The two Koreans exchanged hesitant looks. Rice was about to repeat the order, in a much louder tone, when Sergeant Jin-Sang turned to him. \"Y-Yes, Sir.\" Swallowing audibly, Kwang Ho started the engine and rolled forward. Through Gamera's eyes, Rice saw the other M-113 follow them. When both vehicles got within thirty feet of the giant turtle, he ordered them to stop. Okay, buddy. Carry us to Kaesong so we can get Kon and his men. I will do this. Gamera bent down and clutched both M-113s. A jolt went through the APC before it suddenly lifted straight up. \"What's going on?\" Kwang Ho's voice cracked. \"You're about to get drafted into the air force, Private.\" Rice gave him a wry grin. \"Air Force? What?\" Jin-Sang braced himself against the hull. \"What's going on? What are you going to do with us . . . Sir?\" \"We're going to Kaesong to extract a group of Korean Navy SEALs and we need some sort of container to transport them. These APCs were the best we could come up with on short notice.\" Jin-Sang said nothing. He still stared at Rice like he was crazy, but managed to nod at him. Rice figured the prospect of retrieving fellow Korean warriors mollified him. Another jolt shook the M-113. Kwang Ho yelped and Jin-Sang held on for dear life. Gamera soon leveled out and rocketed north. \"Soto, get me Kon on the line.\" Nervous tension knotted his shoulders. He feared no one would be there to answer them. Relief swelled inside him when he heard a familiar voice in the earpiece. \"This is Commander Kon.\" \"Kon, it's Rice. All missiles have been neutralized. We're on our way to get you. We should be there in a few minutes.\" A couple muffled crashes bled through the earpiece. Kon grunted. \"The sooner you get here the better. The North Koreans are not happy that we have taken over their base.\" \"Just hang on. We'll be there soon. Rice out.\" He handed the receiver back to Soto. His face muscles tightened, willing Gamera to go faster. There are flying machines ahead of us. Rice jumped completely into Gamera's consciousness as a pair of arrow-shaped jets streaked past them. \"Aw crap,\" he groaned, more annoyed than concerned. \"What is it?\" asked Myung-Dae. \"We just got buzzed by a couple MiG-21s.\" \"MiGs!\" Kwang Ho turned to him, his boyish face ablaze with panic. \"They'll shoot us down!\" \"Calm down, Private. It'll take a lot more than missiles and guns to bring down Gamera.\" But if one of those missiles or cannon rounds struck the turtle's hands, the result could be disastrous for them or the other M-113. He had Gamera check over his shoulder. Both MiG-21s were on their six. Both jets also fired a missile at them. Gamera banked sharply to the right. The missiles followed. Gotta be heat seekers, Rice thought. And Gamera's jets gave off one big-ass heat signature. The turtle veered left, then right. The missiles kept after him, getting closer. \"Things might get a little bumpy, guys,\" Rice announced. Through Gamera, he felt more than heard both missiles explode within the plumes of flame gushing from the shell's rear. A few tiny tremors rippled through the turtle's massive body. There were no other ill effects. Gamera banked right, increasing his speed. The MiG-21s followed, tongues of flame shooting from their engines as they went to afterburner. But the old Soviet-made jets couldn't keep up. Gamera soon got behind the MiG-21s. He spat out three fireballs, incinerating both jets. Rice let out a satisfied grunt. \"Well that was a pain in the ass.\" They continued north, slowing down and descending as they neared the DMZ. Soon they passed over the blacked out, rainy cityscape of Kaesong. The Ahobiryong Mountain Range lay in front of them. The red glow of a fire could be seen in the distance. Rice's stomach lurched. As they drew closer, the complex took form. Or rather, what was left of it. Fires, so large and intense even the rain couldn't put them out, illuminated the ravaged complex. A few miles from the base, vehicles clustered around the road. His gaze locked on them, picking out Chuch'e-Po 122mm self-propelled howitzers and BM-21 mobile rocket launchers. The guns boomed, while streaks of orange shot from the barrels of the BM-21s. Behind them sat up to four dozen BTR-60 armored personnel carriers, PT-76 light tanks, and even a few ancient T-34 tanks. Rice could guess their plan. Soften up the complex with an artillery barrage, then send in the armored cavalry to mop up the survivors. Change of plans, assholes. Gamera dove at the North Korean armored brigade. Two fireballs flew out of his mouth. They struck the ground, waves of fire washing over vehicles and troops. Sparks from dozens of separate explosions burst through the firestorm. Rice got on the radio. \"Kon, this is Rice. You there?\" \"I am here.\" \"Gamera took care of the North Korean artillery. We're just a few seconds out. We've got two M-113s to get you out on. As soon as we touch down, get your asses over here.\" \"We'll be ready. Out.\" Gamera went vertical as they reached the complex. Through his eyes, Rice scanned the wrecked and burning base. Well I'll be damned. A sense of pride welled up inside him as he realized why the North Koreans had opted to use artillery on the complex. The smoldering wrecks of a dozen or so armored vehicles were strewn about the place, along with the bodies of numerous enemy soldiers. It appeared as though the North Koreans learned the hard way you don't mess with Navy SEALs, be they American or South Korean. Gamera's legs emerged from his rear openings as he landed. He placed the M-113s on the ground. \"Kon, we're down!\" Rice radioed the Korean SEAL. \"Get out here now!\" \"We're on the way.\" Rice picked up his M4 and ordered Jin-Sang to lower the rear ramp. That's when Gamera spotted a pair of bulky shapes rise from behind the forest. Rice's chest tightened. His eyes picked out the wing stubs bristling weapons and the two bubble-shaped canopies in the front. Mi-24s, one of the most heavily armed, heavily armored helicopters in the world. \"Gamera! Take 'em out, now!\" Gamera roared and stomped forward, his footfalls creating a mini-earthquake around Rice and the others. Orange streaks from rockets and anti-tank missiles flew from the Hinds. Flames burst from their nose-mounted 12.7mm cannons. Rice winced as he felt the barrage strike Gamera's torso. It didn't slow him down a bit. The giant turtle roared, raised its arm, and brought it down. One of the Hinds shattered into a thousand pieces. The second Hind turned and tried to get away. A fireball completely disintegrated it. \"Okay, the Hinds are taken care of,\" Rice announced. \"Go! Go! Go!\" He led Myung-Dae and Soto out of the M-113. Warthan, Candaele and Mungkut charged out of the other one. Several figures scrambled out of a partially collapsed hangar-like structure and sprinted toward them. Rice's eyes widened when he noticed the distinct shapes of their weapons. AK assault rifles and RPG-7s \"Halt!\" He brought up his rifle. \"It's me, Commander Kon. Your parents named you Jim so you would bear the same name as the famous Red Sox baseball player.\" Rice smiled. Yup, that was Kon and his team. Rice figured they must have run out of ammo for their own weapons and raided the armory for North Korean weapons. \"Let's go! Let's go!\" He and his SEALs scanned the perimeter as Kon's men hurried past. One man he recognized from his previous cross-training, a petty officer named In-Su, hurried up to him, pushing along a middle-aged, paunchy man whose hands were bound behind him by duct tape. That's gotta be Barznav. Rice's eyes narrowed at the Latvian scientist. He fought the urge to put a bullet through that bastard's miserable head. In-Su halted near him, looked at the M-113s, then at Gamera. \"You plan to have your turtle carry us out in those?\" He sounded doubtful. \"Feel free to wait here and hail a cab if you want,\" Rice said. In-Su checked around the wrecked complex. \"I will take my chances with the turtle.\" He started toward one of the M-113s, but Barznav resisted. The scientist's eyes fell on Rice's pendant. \"You!\" He hollered in heavily-accented English. \"You are the one who controls Gamera! You are the one who ruined my dreams!\" \"You're breakin' my heart, pal.\" Rice scowled at him. \"Son of a filthy whore!\" Barznav screamed. \"Burn in Hell! I piss on you and all your ancestors!\" Barznav came forward and spat at Rice. A glob of sticky liquid struck him in the face. A huge smile spread across Barznav's face. Rice wiped his cheek with the back of his hand . . . then whipped around his elbow. The point struck Barznav in the cheek. He felt and heard the crunch of bones breaking. Barznav spun around, crying in agony. \"Get this son-of-a-bitch out of my face before I kill him!\" \"Yes, Sir.\" In-Su shoved Barznav forward and herded him into one of the M-113s. Rice noticed a few of Kon's SEALs carrying men over their shoulders. Some were clearly wounded. Others appeared beyond any help. He also spotted one figure that was clearly a woman carrying an AK-74. Probably one of Kon's local contacts. \"Good to see you, Commander,\" Kon said as he approached him. \"Same to to.\" They clasped one another's arms. \"These all your people?\" Kon nodded, his jaw stiffening. \"I lost eight SEALs. We recovered three bodies. The others . . . unfortunately, there wasn't anything to recover. The woman was the only one of our contacts to survive.\" A blade of guilt cut into Rice's heart. If they'd only gotten here sooner. He pushed down his guilt. There'd be plenty of time for that later. \"C'mon.\" He slapped Kon on the shoulder. \"Time to get the hell outta Dodge.\" The two SEAL officers hurried toward one of the M-113s. They both scanned the area, making sure no one was left behind, then went up the ramp. \"Sergeant! Close 'er up!\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Jin-Sang raised the ramp. When they heard from the other M-113 that they were loaded and secure, Rice linked in with Gamera. All right, big guy. Take us home. With pleasure. Gamera took to the air and headed south. Rice leaned against the hull and slumped to his rear-end. He let out a long, relieved breath. Can we rest soon? Gamera asked. Rice smiled. Yeah. I think we earned it. XXXXX \"Let's go! Hurry! Hurry!\" The Great Leader waved his arm, urging his family to hurry onboard the underground train. He took quick, nervous breaths as he watched his wife, his grown sons, and his two mistresses walk past him and into the compartment. Several enlisted men followed, carrying or dragging several pieces of luggage. Once everyone was on board, two of the Great Leader's bodyguards entered the train, followed by the Great Leader himself, then two more bodyguards. \"Colonel Hyun-Shik,\" he said to the burly chief of his security detail. \"Is everyone on board?\" \"Yes, Great Leader.\" \"Then tell the conductor get underway.\" \"Yes, Great Leader.\" Hyun-Shik strode toward the front of the train. Hands behind his back, the Great Leader shuffled to the set furthest away from his family and mistresses and dropped into it. He looked out at the underground station. A scowl formed on his pudgy face. He felt the bland concrete walls and platform were mocking him. This will be the last part of the People's Republic you will ever see. The Great Leader faced forward, grinding his teeth. The face of his father, the Eternal President, formed in his mind's eye. I have failed you, father. Our country will soon cease to exist. No! He did not fail his father. His generals and ministers failed him. Their incompetence led the People's Republic to ruin. They were the ones who convinced him to go along with Barznav's scheme. Why didn't anyone tell me the damn giant turtle would show up? Why didn't anyone come up with a way to stop it? They would pay. Before he left, the Great Leader gave the commander of the Special Purpose Forces a list of all those to be executed. They included every single member of the National Defense Commission. He even put Barznav's name on it. \"I don't care if the imperialists captured him,\" he had told the commander. \"Find a way to get to him and kill the bastard!\" The train lurched forward. The station vanished from view, replaced by darkness. Before long the train built up speed as it headed north toward the Chinese border. His family and mistresses chatted away far behind him. He had no idea what they were saying. He didn't care. He simply looked straight ahead, thinking about all the reports he'd received right up to the time he left for this underground train. Following the attack on the complex outside Kaesong, Gamera had not been sighted for twenty-four hours. He thought perhaps the damn monster had abandoned the imperialists, that he still had a chance to salvage a victory. The Great Leader ordered all his forces in the South to converge on Pusan, annihilating everything in their path. He also dispatched every remaining ship in the Eastern Fleet to Japan, with orders to attack any coastal city they came across until they ran out of ammunition. The lead elements of the ground forces got within thirty miles of Pusan when Gamera reappeared. Division after division, corps after corps, was wiped out by a storm of fireballs. As for the Eastern Fleet, not a single ship got close to the Japanese mainland. The Maritime Self-Defense Force sent sixty vessels of the People's Navy to the bottom. The Japanese, meanwhile, did not suffer any losses. Fury built up inside him. Fury at his military, his ministers, his government functionaries, even at the citizens of the People's Republic. They did not put all their heart, all their effort, into forging an undefeatable nation. They had failed him. Let them all burn then, damn them! The Great Leader pressed his back into his seat. He washed his hands of his people, of his entire nation. They did not deserve a leader like him. The South Koreans and Americans can slaughter every last one of them. And while the birds picked at their bones, he would enjoy life on his private island off the coast of Shanghai. He had bought it from the Chinese several years ago, as insurance in case something catastrophic happened and he needed to flee the People's Republic. Like the people failing to do their duty and win a war. For the first time in nearly two days, the Great Leader allowed himself a smile. His thoughts turned to his private island. It boasted two mansions, three Olympic-sized swimming pools, a small but modern hospital and a 200-seat movie theater. He also had an arrangement with the Chinese government to provide him with his own private security force, along with the best prostitutes Shanghai had to offer. He'd also never have to worry about money, not with over 700 million dollars stashed away in numerous banks all over the world. He may no longer rule a nation, but he at least would live out his remaining years in luxury. \"Great Leader.\" Colonel Hyun-Shik approached. \"I have just been contacted by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. They say they will have a representative meet us at the station in Ji'an.\" \"Good, good. Thank you, Colonel.\" The Great Leader sat up straighter. The defeat of the People's Republic drifted further from his mind. Instead he thought about watching movies and laying on the beach while beautiful Chinese prostitutes serviced him. The train slowed to a stop. He looked out the window and saw forests on either side. A short man with a wrinkled face and wearing a dark suit stood on the platform, along with four soldiers carrying compact QBZ-95 rifles. Bodyguards, he assumed. The Great Leader stepped out of the train with Hyun-Shik and his bodyguards and approached the small Chinese delegation. \"Great Leader.\" The Chinese official bowed. \"I am Han Shou, an aide to the Deputy Foreign Minister of Asian/Pacific Affairs.\" \"Greetings. I thank you for your hospitality. Now, I wish to go to my island. Where is the nearest airport?\" \"I'm sorry, Great Leader, but you will not be going to your island. There has been a change in the arrangement between you and my government.\" The Great Leader's face twisted in anger and confusion, while his bodyguards exchanged perplexed looks. \"What do you mean a change? I paid your government for that island. It is mine. Now take me to it.\" Shou's face remained impassive. \"I am sorry, Great Leader. I cannot do that.\" \"Yes you can do that!\" The Great Leader took a step forward. The Chinese soldiers tensed. So did the North Korean bodyguards. \"I demand to talk to your Foreign Minister! No! I demand to talk to your President! This is inexcusable. I will see you punished for this.\" The threat did nothing to faze Shou. \"My orders come directly from the President.\" \"Explain yourself!\" \"Very well. You see, there is a certain image China must present to the world if we are to maintain our standing as a superpower. It would not be to our advantage to harbor a man who launched nuclear weapons at three different countries, threatening the lives of millions and causing environmental damage for years, even centuries, to come. The backlash against China would be tremendous. Boycotts and possible embargos could cost us billions, not to mention diminish our influence in the world. Therefore, the President has decided to rescind your agreement with him. Instead, you will be detained until such time as we can make arrangements to turn you over to the South Korean government.\" The Great Leader's head spun. He staggered backwards. This could not be. He had a deal with the Chinese. They could not renege on it. They . . . They couldn't turn him over to the imperialists. Didn't they realize those corrupt bastards would kill him? \"You . . . You cannot do this to me. You cannot!\" \"I am sorry. But that is the President's decision, and -\" \"Your President is a back-stabbing scum who fornicates with pigs!\" The eyes of the Chinese soldiers bulged. Even Shou reacted to the insult, as his eyebrow went up. \"You will not arrest me!\" The Great Leader raged. \"You will not turn me over to the imperialists! I will go to my island and no one will stop me! Guards! Kill them all!\" The North Koreans raised their Type 56 rifles. Hyun-Shik went for his pistol. Five quick, muffled pops came from the forest. Bloody holes appeared in the heads of Hyun-Shik and the bodyguards. They collapsed onto the platform, blood and brains spattering the side of the train. The Great Leader cried out and dropped to his knees. He covered his head with his hands as his body shook. Snipers! The bastard Chinese had snipers hidden in the woods. \"Regrettable,\" Shou said. \"We had hoped to avoid violence, but you forced our hand. I beg you not to take any other actions that would necessitate a . . . drastic response. Guards.\" The Chinese soldiers marched over. Two of them gripped the Great Leader by the arms and hoisted him to his feet. \"Get your hands off me!\" He screamed and struggled, unable to break the soldiers' vice-like grip. \"Release me! Release me!\" Tears streamed down the Great Leader's cheeks as the soldiers dragged him away. NEXT: THE CONCLUSION[Chapter 14] Rice pressed the binoculars against his eyes, staring out the open door of the US Army Blackhawk helicopter flying near Suwon. Tanks, APCs, self-propelled guns, trucks and other vehicles covered large stretch of field just a few miles away. The North Korean 5th Army Corps. You see what I see, buddy? He communicated with Gamera. I see them. Take 'em out. Rice shifted his binoculars to the right. A large contrail cut across the sky, diving toward the ground. How about we strafe them from the air first, then we'll . . . His brow furrowed as he looked through Gamera's eyes. \"What the hell?\" \"What is it, Sir?\" asked Senior Chief Warthan, who knelt behind him. Rice didn't answer. He continued staring at the North Koreans. His disbelief soon gave way to amazement. The tanks and SPGs rotated their turrets to the rear. Several soldiers held up sticks or poles, a white sheet tied to each one. \"Oh my God. They're surrendering.\" \"What!\" both Candaele and Soto blurted at the same time. \"They're surrendering! The bastards are surrendering! Gamera!\" Gamera, don't attack them. Do not attack them. They're surrendering. If that is your desire. What shall I do then? Land near them and just look intimidating. I can do that. Rice cranked an eyebrow. Did Gamera just make a joke? He ordered the pilot to land near the North Koreans. When he and the other SEALs got out, Gamera stood about forty meters from the lead elements of the 5th Corps, growling as he eyed the enemy soldiers. Rice watched as North Koreans dropped their weapons and held up their hands, aiming terrified looks at Gamera. One soldier, rather tall for a Korean at around 6'2 with a weathered face, caught sight of Rice and his SEALs. He removed the pistol from his holster, threw it on the ground, and called over one of the soldiers waving a white flag. The two walked over to them. \"Are you in charge?\" Rice asked, with Myung-Dae translating. \"I am General Soo, commander of the Fifth Army Corps. I beg you to call off your monster. I formally surrender my entire command to you. We will not resist.\" \"Good to hear. Tell your men to move away from their vehicles and weapons and sit on the ground. Anyone does anything we don't like . . .\" Rice glanced up at Gamera. \"I'm sure by now you know what my pal here can do.\" \"I do. We will do as you say.\" Soo walked back to his men, shouting out orders. They tramped away from their vehicles and fallen weapons, many staring up at Gamera as they walked. \"Soto. Tell CFC we just took the entire North Korean Fifth Corps prisoner.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The comm specialist smiled wide. \"If this doesn't earn us a medal, I don't know what will.\" Rice's SEALs and Gamera watched over the North Korean. Soo was true to his word. Not a single soldier of his caused any trouble. After three hours of guard duty, the growl of numerous engines floated over the air. Rice looked toward the highway and saw a column of vehicles headed their way. Older combat vehicles. M60 tanks, M-113 APCs, even Jeeps. Definitely South Korean. Probably one of their reserve units. Rice handed control of the prisoners over to them. He headed back to the helicopter with the other SEALs, checking over a map of the peninsula. \"Let's see, last report we got, the Four Twenty-fifth Mech Corps was still positioned around Songnam, and we've got the Seventh Corps dug in near Wonju. Anyone got any preferences?\" \"I say we hit the Mech Corps,\" Warthan said. \"Let's start taking out their defenses around Seoul.\" \"Well, like an ROTC instructor of mine once said, never argue with a Senior Chief Petty Officer, because they're always right.\" \"A wise man, Sir.\" Rice grinned and looked to the other SEALs. \"All right. Let's hit the road to Songnam. Soto. Let CFC know where we're headed.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" They climbed aboard the Blackhawk. Just as they lifted off, Soto turned to him. \"Sir, General Taylor's on the line. He says he needs to talk to you right away.\" Rice took the receiver, wondering if the Combined Forces Commander had a priority target for them. \"General. This is Commander Rice.\" \"Commander, what's your current status?\" \"We just handed over the prisoners from Fifth Corps to the South Koreans. We're on our way to Songnam to take out the Four Twenty-Fifth Mech Corps.\" \"Negative, Commander. Your SEALs and Gamera are ordered to stand down.\" \"Sir?\" Rice's face scrunched in bewilderment. \"We've recently been in contact with General Ri, the Chief of the Korean People's Army General Staff. Their so-called Great Leader has left the country, and apparently ordered his Special Purpose Forces to eliminate everyone on the National Defense Commission as punishment for failing to win this war. Ri found out about it and stopped them. He's taken control of the North Korean government, and has ordered all his military forces to lay down their arms and surrender.\" Rice's mouth opened, but he was too stunned to speak. He drew a breath, trying to regain his senses. \"Sir, are you saying the war is over?\" Every SEAL around him looked his way, all their faces registering surprise. \"That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm ordering a halt to all American and South Korean offensive operations effective immediately. The Japanese have already sent similar orders to their Self-Defense Forces. Gamera is not to engage in any offensive actions against North Korean forces. Understood?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"You and your men return to Pusan and await further orders. Good work, all of you.\" \"Thank you, Sir.\" \"Taylor out.\" Rice lowered the receiver. He stared at the deck, trying to absorb what Taylor had told him. \"Is it true, Sir?\" asked Mongkut. \"Is the war over?\" He turned to the sniper. \"That's what General Taylor said. He said the crazy Umpa-Lumpa skipped town and some big-shot general took over the country and surrendered.\" No one spoke. Only the thumping rotors of the Blackhawk could be heard. \"It's over.\" Candaele grinned wide. \"Hot digiddy damn, it's over!\" The SEALs whooped and cheered and slapped one another on the arms and backs. Many of the hardest slaps were reserve for Lieutenant Myung-Dae, whose face scrunched up, like he was about to cry. The Korean, however, held it in. My task here is finished. \"What?\" Rice looked over his shoulder, then realized it was Gamera who \"spoke.\" Thulgira is dead. Your human enemies have been defeated. It is time for me to leave. Rice stared out the open door at Gamera, whose eyes locked on helicopter. \"Pilot. Hold your position.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The Blackhawk hovered. Rice and Gamera continued to stare at one another. I can't believe this is it. I was getting used to having you in my head, and vice versa. I have served my purpose, as you have served yours as my link. I pretty much figured this was a temporary thing. Probably just as well. No one person should control something as powerful as you. And that is why you were a worthy link. Rice thumped his chest and pointed at Gamera. Thanks for your help, buddy. We never could have done this without you. Nor I you. Farewell, Jim Rice Take care of yourself, big guy. Gamera lifted his head to the sky and roared. His rear jets erupted and he shot into the sky. Rice watched as the turtle climbed higher and higher. \"Where's he going, Sir?\" asked Candaele. \"No idea.\" \"Whoa!\" Soto blurted. \"Check that out.\" Rice looked down. His pendant glowed bright red for several seconds, then faded. He clutched the stone. It felt cold. He couldn't feel the slightest tingle of energy coming from it. \"Is, um . . . is Gamera still in your head, Sir?\" asked Warthan. A frown formed on Rice's face. \"Not any more.\" XXXXX Gimhae International Airport, Pusan. Two weeks later. \"The first troops of the newly formed United Nations Korean Relief Force, or KOREFOR, arrived in that war-ravaged country today,\" said the attractive blond anchor for FOX News. \"While they will aid US and South Korean forces in security operations, their main focus will be on humanitarian relief. The recently ended war has left millions of Koreans homeless, and millions more injured and unable to receive adequate medical care as many of South Korea's major hospitals were destroyed. The first contingent of KOREFOR troops come from Australia, New Zealand, The Philippines and Thailand. Over the next few weeks, more troops will arrive from Canada, India, Brazil, Peru, Finland and twenty other countries. As the UN forces in Korea increase, they will assist in the demobilization and disarmament of the North Korean military, and aid officials from the International Atomic Energy Commission in the dismantling of what remains of the North's nuclear program. Many of their facilities were destroyed during the war by US bombers, and the six nuclear missiles they launched at South Korea, Japan and Alaska were all intercepted and shot down by Gamera.\" A graphic appeared behind the anchor, showing the faces of The Great Leader and Uldis Barznav. \"Officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments met with their counterparts in South Korea and Japan to determine the best way to try North Korea's former ruler, along with Doctor Uldis Barznav, who created the technology that controlled Thulgira, and members of the National Defense Commission. They are all charged with war crimes for the deliberate murder of civilians during the Second Korean War. US Secretary of State Oldendorf says he envisions a Nuremburg Trial-like approach, in which a panel of judges from the three countries attacked by North Korea will preside over the case. Officials with the International Criminal Court say they are willing to try the case, expressing concerns that judges and lawyers from the victorious nations would not be able try the case impartially, thus denying North Korea's leaders their right to a fair trial.\" Rice emitted a snorting, humorless laugh as he watched the TV in the lounge. \"Nice to know there's someone out there who cares about the rights of a bunch of slimebags who slaughtered millions.\" Warthan grunted. \"Some people are just too nice for their own damn good.\" \"Yeah,\" Candaele chimed in. \"They shoulda done to them what the Romanians did to their dictator back in the Eighties. Quick trial, convict him, then take him out back and shoot him.\" \"Works for me,\" Rice said. A short, young female airman walked over to them. \"Excuse me, Commander. Your plane is ready to take off. Please follow me.\" Rice smiled and jumped to his feet. \"You got it, Airman.\" Excitement and anticipation swelled inside him as he and his SEALs followed the airman through the terminal. By tomorrow, he'd be back in the United States, alive and in one piece. He'd see Rita. Heat surged through him as he imagined her face, her body, and them in bed together, for hours and hours. Maybe days and days. They just stepped out on the tarmac when he noticed two familiar people in combat fatigues. Lieutenant Myung-Dae and Commander Kon. \"We heard you were heading back to America,\" Kon said. \"Yup. Our job's done here.\" Rice bit his lip. \"I guess your jobs are just starting. You got a lot of work to do to put this country back together.\" \"We rebuilt after the first war. We can do it again,\" Myung-Dae said with utmost confidence. \"And it looks like we will have a bigger country than before,\" Kon added. \"The President hopes that by this time next year, reunification will become a reality.\" Rice smiled. He liked the sound of that. No more DMZ. No more threat of North Korean nukes. For the first time in more than 60 years, there would be peace on the Korean peninsula. \"Well, when that happens, I hope we can come back here and cross-train with you guys again.\" \"I look forward to that,\" Kon said. The SEALs all shook hands, with Rice telling Myung-Dae, \"Nice working with you, Lieutenant. You did good work.\" \"Thank you, Sir. Hopefully we work together again.\" With a final farewell, Rice and his SEALs boarded their waiting C-17 transport. \"Next stop,\" Candaele declared. \"The good ol' US of A.\" The SEALs cheered as they went up the ramp. Fifteen minutes later, they were airborne. They spent the flight talking about their plans when they got back to The States, or playing cards, or reading paperbacks, or eating from an MRE. Damn, but Rice was sick of the things. When he got back to San Diego, he planned to take Rita to some nice restaurant, have himself a big-ass steak, a big-ass baked potato with sour cream and butter, a big-ass slice of All-American apple pie, and wash it down with a big-ass mug of beer. I wish this friggin' crate would go faster. They had a layover in Guam before continuing on to Hawaii. The SEALs slept most of the time, being awakened when it was time for their meal. Another friggin' MRE. They refueled in Hawaii, then winged their way east toward the Continental United States. When one of the C-17 crewmen came by with more MREs, Rice was sorely tempted to shoot the guy. At 1640 local time, they touched down at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. Finally, they were home. \"Hello, America!\" Candaele dropped to his knees and kissed the tarmac. \"Oh, how I missed you, baby.\" He looked up at the other SEALs, most of whom snickered at him. \"C'mon. You know you wanna do it.\" \"You can kiss that dirty asphalt all you want, Candaele,\" said Rice. \"Me, I'm gonna go home and kiss my wife . . . a lot.\" The others hooted and hollered. \"Yeah.\" Soto strutted proudly. \"I got plenty of senoritas around here who need some kissing from yours truly.\" \"Yeah, right.\" Warthan scoffed. \"The only senoritas you're gonna be with tonight are Rosie Palm and her five sisters.\" The SEALs laughed out loud. Soto flipped them off. They got into a couple Humvees and drove to Coronado, where they turned in their weapons and gear. When they left the armory, a bald, solidly-built man stood waiting for them. \"Welcome back, men. Good job over there.\" \"Thank you, Sir,\" Rice said to Captain Alec Marshall, the CO of SEAL Team Three. \"You still have a couple more debriefings to go through, but we can put that off until tomorrow. After that, you're all getting a month's leave.\" The SEALs cheered, high-fiving each other and thanking Captain Marshall. \"You're all free to go home, except you, Commander.\" \"What do you need me for, Sir?\" Marshall frowned. \"Not me. Them.\" He jerked a thumb to his right. Rice turned. He saw a black government-issue sedan parked by the curb. Two unsmiling men wearing dark suits and sunglasses stood next to the car. \"Who are those stiffs?\" \"No one.\" The skin around Marshall's nose crinkled. \"They don't officially exist.\" Rice groaned, his shoulders sagging. Just what I need after a long friggin' flight. \"Watch your ass with them, Jim,\" Marshall warned. \"Yes, Sir.\" He trudged over to the car, wondering who the men worked for. CIA? NSA? DIA? Some alphabet soup agency no one was supposed to know about? \"You wanna see me?\" \"Are you Commander Jim Rice?\" asked the taller of the two. \"Yeah. Who are you?\" \"We're from the Department of Defense.\" Yeah, and I'm the drummer for Dropkick Murphys. \"Come with us.\" The tall man opened the car door. Rice let out an annoyed sighed and got in. They drove to the base-housing area in silence. His eyes flickered back and forth between the two suits. The tall man, who drove, looked like he wore a toupee. His partner had a stocky build and wide face with protruding lips that reminded him of chimpanzee. Rug and Chimp. That's what I'll call you guys. They escorted him to a Bachelor Officers' Quarters that was currently unoccupied. In the living room a table had been set up with a polygraph operated by a plump, middle-age woman with a sagging face and her brown-gray hair tied in a tight bun. She kind of reminded Rice of the woman who ran the cafeteria at his old middle school. Lunch Lady. Two other suits stood by the doorway of the bedroom. \"I need your pendant,\" Rug demanded. Rice scowled at him, then removed it from around his neck. \"I better get that back. That's a gift from my wife.\" Rug didn't acknowledge his request. Instead he handed it to one of the suits, who disappeared into the bedroom with his partner. \"Sit down,\" Rug ordered him. \"What's this about?\" \"We want to ask you some questions about your mission in Korea. Sit.\" Rice plopped down in the metal folding chair next to the table. Lunch Lady attached all sorts of wires to him. \"Now, I need to set a baseline for the polygraph,\" she told him. \"Please answer the first two questions truthfully, and the third question false. Do you understand?\" \"Yeah.\" He slouched in the chair. \"Is your name Lieutenant Commander James Edward Rice?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you currently serve with the United States Navy's SEAL Team Three?\" \"Yes.\" \"Were you born in Providence, Rhode Island?\" \"No.\" Lunch Lady stared at her computer screen, then shifted her eyes to him. \"Good. We can begin. Now, did your unit take part in the Second Korean War?\" \"Yes.\" \"During that time, did you control the monster known as Gamera?\" \"Yes . . . well, yes and no.\" Lunch Lady looked up, frowning. \"Commander Rice, just answer yes or no to the question.\" \"Sorry, but that's not really a yes or no question.\" \"Either you controlled Gamera or you didn't. Now answer the question.\" \"I didn't control Gamera. We . . . worked together is the best way I can describe it. We shared each other's thoughts, we shared each other's strength. But I didn't control him like, say, some tech weenie controls a Predator drone.\" \"Okay.\" Rug strode over to him, looking unhappier than before. \"You don't want to answer yes or no to that question, then how about this one? Did you, at any time you controlled Gamera, have a desire to use it against the United States Government?\" \"What? Are you for real?\" \"Answer the question.\" \"Of course I didn't, you schmuck.\" Rug turned to Lunch Lady. She shook her head and looked up at him. \"His readings did spike, but that could be because he's angry.\" \"You're damn right I'm angry.\" Rice scowled at her. \"Or maybe he is lying.\" Rug stood in front of him, arms folded. \"Maybe he did think about using a giant fire-breathing turtle to overthrow the government. Who wouldn't? We all saw what Gamera did. Spit out a couple fireballs, and an entire North Korean army division is incinerated. That kind of power would go to anyone's head.\" \"Not mine.\" \"Well maybe you're just biding your time. Maybe you sent Gamera away, told him to lie low, let this war fade from the public's mind before you called him back to take over the country. Is that your plan?\" \"No.\" Rug glanced over at Lunch Lady, who said. \"All indications are it is a truthful response.\" The corner of Rug's mouth twitched. He turned back to Rice. \"Have you had any contact with Gamera since the war ended?\" \"No.\" \"And why is that?\" \"My link with him was broken when the war ended. He served his purpose, that's what he told me.\" \"Gamera told you this? You two actually talked to one another?\" \"Yes, through some sort of telepathy.\" Rug looked to Lunch Lady, who nodded. His face stiffened before he turned back to Rice. \"The machine says you're telling the truth. But we know these things can be fooled.\" Rug leaned down, his face less than a foot from Rice's. He could smell the guy's after shave. \"I know SEALs are trained to control their emotions, their breathing, their heart rate. To remain calm when all hell's breaking loose. Or maybe you're getting mad to throw off our readings. Because to be honest, I can't believe that anyone who controls a monster as powerful as Gamera would not consider, even for a fleeting second, using that thing to take over not just the country, but the world. You expect me to believe you're some kind of altruistic hero straight out of a comic book? You expect me to believe you're that selfless?\" Rug shoved his face closer to Rice's. \"I want to know every thought you had when you were controlling Gamera. I want to know how that little necklace of yours works, and I want to know how we can use it to defend this country in case Gamera or some other monster attacks us. And we're not leaving here until I get the answers I want.\" Rug jabbed a finger into Rice's chest. \"Are we clear, Comma-\" Rice left arm shot out, yanking the wires connected to it. He grabbed Rug by the balls and twisted. The asshole gasped, his mouth wide open. Chimp rushed over. Rice's right elbow rammed into the man's gut. He crumpled to the floor. Lunch Lady looked on with fearful, bulging eyes. Rice twisted Rug's balls harder. His face turned bright red. \"Listen, peckerhead,\" Rice spoke in a low, menacing tone. \"I don't like people shouting in my face, I don't like people poking me in the chest, I don't like people questioning my loyalty to this country, and I sure as hell don't like you. Now here's the summary of what happened to me in Korea, so listen good, because I'm only gonna say this once. My pendant linked me with Gamera. We worked together to kill Thulgira, shoot down six nuclear missiles that threatened millions of people, and incinerate half the North Korean Army before they surrendered. My link with Gamera ended, he flew away, I haven't heard from him since, I don't expect to, and that is that. Got it?\" He swung his head toward Lunch Lady. \"Got it?\" She checked her screen, then looked up. \"H-He's telling the truth.\" Rice let go of Rug's balls. He collapsed to his knees just as the other suits emerged from the bedroom. They gave Rug, and Rice, curious looks. One of them said, \"We, um, examined the pendant. There's absolutely no trace of any energy whatsoever. It's just an ordinary stone.\" \"It's not an ordinary stone.\" Rice yanked out the wires connected to the polygraph. \"It's a good luck charm from my wife.\" He stomped over and snatched the pendant from the suit's hand. Neither he nor his partner made a move to stop him as he headed toward the door. He looked over his shoulder at Rug, who was still on his knees. \"We're done here.\" \"Yeah,\" Rug replied in a strained voice. Rice exited the BOQ and looked around the area to get his bearings. His and Rita's house was roughly two-and-a-half miles to the west. Guess I'm hoofin' it. He set off down the sidewalk, hanging the pendant around his neck. He clutched the hook-shaped stone between his thumb and index finger, smiling as he stared at it. An image of Rita's face materialized in his mind's eye. He smiled wider. You were right, babe. This thing really did bring us good luck. THE END ","Summary":" 20 miles north of Kaesong, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, aka North Korea.

But not characters from the movie that I owned. In 1984 at Urbania, in the beginning of the scene shows a water tower with words on it in the middle that says, \"Welcome to Urbania.\" Scene then goes down below the trees and on to a road by white wooden fences. A truck pasts by the fence. We then see two boys and a girl walking on the side of the road. The little girl wearing blue overall jeans, black and white stripes shirt, and red baseball cap is Kimberly. The boy wearing the white shirt and blue jean shorts is Kevin. And the little boy with the glasses, blue jeans, and red shirt is their brother, Danny. Danny and Kimberly is pretending to play real football. Which is annoying Kevin. Kimberly talking and holding the ball. Kimberly: The colossal Kevin O'Shea goes back to pass. Sees her little brother Danny downfield. The rush is on. The ball is in the air. The crowd is going wild. Kimmy catches the ball. She's at the 10, the 20, the 25. It looks like she could go all the way. The O'Sheas are about to win the championship. (Drops the ball) Oh, there's a fumble. (Picks it up) Kimmy got it. (Turns to see her brothers keep walking) Oh. Hey, Danny, Kevin, wait up. How many touchdowns you both gonna throw me today, huh? I'll bet it's at least 50, maybe 100. Kevin: What time did mom said she was gonna pick you up? Kimberly: I don't know, Kev. Maybe at 3:00 after school. I guess. Danny: (Kimberly gives the ball to Danny) No way, Kimmy. She's not picking us up. She said we could spend the entire day with you. Isn't that great? Kimberly: (Raised her eyebrow) I guess. Kevin: (sarcastically) Yeah, great. Kevin then climbs over the fence. So does Kimberly. And Danny climbs too, but having trouble. He drops the ball and falls a little. He gets up, picks up the ball, and runs to his brother. Kevin holds the ball. Kevin: Okay, spaces or laces? Kevin and one of the boys chose Spaces. Kevin spins the ball around the ground and everyone shouts for it to land on spaces. Danny looks at it and the ball lands on laces. All the boys except for Kevin, Danny, and Kimberly groan. Kevin: Laces, daddy-o. As he chose. Danny then picks up the ball and waits for to get picked by his brother and his sister. Kevin starts with the boy named Butz. Kevin: I'll take Butz. Butz: Yes! It's over! Butz Goes to Kevin. Stein and Rip, Pinski, McCormick, Ralphy, Mouse, and Moritti has been picked except Danny and Kimberly. Not only that, Everyone goes to their positions, but Danny and Kimberly are sad because his brother and his sister didn't get picked. Kevin goes to him and asks for the ball. Kevin: Let's play some football! (To Kimmy) Hey, Kimmy, the ball. Give me. Kimberly: (sarcastically) Shit, Kevin. Danny and I must be pretty bad if our own brother won't even pick us. Danny: Why you didn't pick us? It's not fair anyway, Kevin. Kevin: Come on, guys, I just said it once and I already told you hundredth time. Just look at it my way. Danny: I stink, and you know it. You're perfect, and I stink. Kimberly: And this is a boys league, I'm a girl, and girls can't play football. Danny and Kimberly: That's it. The end. Kevin: No, guys. That's not it. It's just that I'm so good, it makes both of you look really bad. Danny: Are you trying to cheer us up? Kevin: Yeah. Kimberly: It's ain't gonna work this time, Kev. Sorry. Kevin: You see? I stink at something, too. Now give me the ball! (Grabs the ball and runs to his team) Score a couple touchdowns for both of you! They both sad and Kimberly cussed out of anger. And now they both walk away from Kevin and sits on the bench. Kimberly: (angrily) Damn it. Don't worry, Danny. One day we going make our team ourselves and and we'll going to beat our brother, because he's a jerk anyway. Danny: And an arrogant, too. Kevin: (shouting) We kick off! Stand back, baby! As getting ready for the game, Kevin and his friends go by the flag and the park gate. A little girl come out and goes to see Kimberly and Danny. It's Patty, Danny's crush and Kimberly's best friend. Also, Patty and Kimberly are in the same age as well. Patty says hello to both. Patty Hi, Danny. Hi, Kimmy. Danny and Kimberly: Hi, Patty Patty: What's the matter, guys? You look sad. Aren't you playing today? Danny: No, I'm on the injured list. Kimberly: My stupid brother didn't pick me, because I'm girl and girls can't play football. Patty: (shocked) Again? Kevin didn't pick you? and Danny, too? Kimberly: Yeah. Danny: Don't worry, Patty. One day Kimmy and I'll going make our own team and we can beat our brother. Kimberly: That's a spirit, Danny. (High five to Danny) Before the game starts, Kevin is getting ready for the the kickoff. But Kevin has really something to say to Danny and Kimberly before the kickoff. Kevin: Hey, Danny. (Danny looks at him, points to the water tower, and Danny and Kimberly turns to see the water tower) You see that water tower? One day our names gonna be up there in big bold letters. The O'Sheas. We're gonna own this town, you and me, buddy. (To Kimberly) And as for you, Kimmy, (Kimberly turns to see him) do me a favor, sis. Since you want to join us to own this town too, maybe one day when you grow up, get married and have kids. If you get a son of your own and when he grows up, he'll be a football player just like me. I can promise you that. Kevin then kicks the ball in the air. The ball goes so high in the air, it goes up the water tower. Kevin looks at the ball and grins. Danny and Kimberly look up at it in way. Will they get their dreams or will only Kevin get his? TO BE CONTINUED... That's the end of chapter of this for for now. Like I said Kevin then kicks the ball in the air. The ball goes so high in the air, it goes up the water tower. Kevin looks at the ball and grins. Danny and Kimberly look up at it in way. Will they get their dreams or will only Kevin get his?

It passes the water tower, but its words have changed. The words say, \"Welcome to Urbania, home of football's great Kevin O'Shea.\" On the ground, Kevin is now an adult. He's training kids to play football. Kevin (yelling) Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! Come on, people! Show me something! Move it! Move it! Are you kidding, people? It's called sweat. Show me some! Move. Move.

Shawn and Shane blocking the kid. Shane: You've gotta get by me first, bro. Shawn (yelling) Yeah! What you gonna do now, homeboy?! As the run goes on, Rudy is running with the ball. Alex tackles him, but he has some help. Becky tackles Rudy, too. He yells before going down, dropping the ball. Kevin and Butz were impressed. Kevin: Ooh, baby! Now we're talking. Butz: Yeah. Kevin and Butz go on the field to check on Rudy as the kids gather around him. Kevin clearing the kids out. Kevin: All right, everybody back up. Back up. Make room. Give him some air. Kneels down to him and looks at Alex and Becky. Kevin: Nice pop, you two. Becky and Alex: Thanks, Uncle Kev. The girl takes her helmet off, she is Becky O'Shea, Danny's little girl. Everyone calls her the Icebox, Except Danny, Kimberly, and Alex. Shane: Is he dead? Shawn: Well, I guess he ain't moving. Derek: I think Alex and Icebox hits him too hard. Patterson: (angrily) You killed him, Shorty and Icebox! Alex: (embarrassing whispers) Aw, shit. Shawn: Shut up, Patterson. It just a clean hit anyway. (To Alex) Don't worry, my main man, you did the right thing. Alex: Thanks, Shawn. (High five and hand shake to Shawn) Alex high five to Becky, too, but Becky asked Rudy on the ground. Becky: Hey, Rudy. You okay? Kevin then takes off Rudy's helmet as Rudy moans in pain. Everyone sees his forehead with a red stain on it. Shane: (whispers) They hit so hard, they made Rudy bleed. But it wasn't blood, it turns out the strain came from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from his helmet. Everyone started to laugh and groaned Becky and everybody groaned, too. Becky: (disgusted) Oh, Rudy! Alex: (groans) You're sick, dude! Alex groaned Kevin takes the sandwich out of the helmet and gives the helmet to Butz. He looks back and forth to Rudy and the sandwich. Kevin: Peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Are you nuts? Rudy sits up, takes the sandwich and takes a bite outta it. Rudy: Still good. Kevin: You'll never get anywhere treating your helmet like a lunchbox, son. Sees Butz holding up a bag of chips and Kevin asked. Kevin: What is that? Butz: Cheetos. Kevin: Crunchy or puffed? Butz: Puffed. Kevin: Wimp. Butz puts the cheetos back in the helmet as Rudy takes another bite of the sandwich. Kevin gets up and talks to the kids. Kevin: All right, everyone from here over, go with coach Butz. Everyone from here over, come with me. Let's go! Let's find out who's gonna make this team. When Rudy is gonna take another bite, Butz grabs it and puts it back in the helmet. This gets Rudy mad. Rudy: (angrily) My mom made that! On a next try out, Kevin and Butz throws balls to the kids, to see who can catch good. Kevin throws one to Becky and catches it. He then throws it to Derek and catches it, too. He passes to Shane and catches it. Alex runs in and Kevin throws it to him and he catches it. He throws another ball to Shawn and he catches it as well. Also, he throws to Murphy and he catches it. Kevin then throws one to Hanon, but unfortunately, he misses it. He picks it up and runs to Butz. Everyone groan and Hanon picks up the ball and goes to Butz. Kevin: Next time, son. Derek: Aw, man! Shane: Come on, bro. Shawn: At least you could've caught it, Hanon. But the coaches are disappointed. Butz: He got booted. Kevin: Hands like flying pan. Hanon gives the balls to Butz and they go back in line. Hanon then talks to his hands. Hanon: (Talking to his hands) Why are you doing this to me, fellas? I cut your nails, wash you, put gloves on you when you're cold. They come in behind Murphy, who turns around and faces them. Murphy: Hey, Hanon, you ever catch anything, ever? Derek: Lay off of him, Murph. He at least tried catch a ball. Alex and Becky comes up behind them and listens and watches them. Hanon: Caught a cold yesterday, Murph. Here, have some! Hanon blows his nose at Murphy who's trying to cover himself. And Alex and Becky started laughing. Alex: (laughs) Man, that's a good one, Hanon! Murphy: Gross! Gross! Get off of me, you little dork! On the next try out, Kevin tests the speed of the kids. Kevin: Speed, the distance gained divided by the time of travel. You clowns want to play football, you gotta move. Ready? Kevin blows the whistle and Tad starts running, but he's running all silly. A couple of the kids start to laugh at him. Becky, Alex, and their friends cheer for him. Becky: Come on, Tad! Alex: Go, Tad! Come on, dig! Shawn: Move those feet, homeboy! Tad makes it and goes back in line. But Kevin was not impressed. Kevin: What is this, a telethon? Rudy gets ready, Kevin blows the whistle and Rudy starts running, but he was running slow, thanks to his weight. He keeps making honking noises as he breathes heavily. He passes by Kevin, who wasn't impressed again. Kevin: Next. He blows the whistle and Briggs runs fast. He runs by Kevin and Rudy and goes back in line. Kevin was now impressed. Kevin: 8.5. Excellent, Briggs. Rudy is caching a breath and taps on Kevin's shoulder. Rudy: (exhausted) How'd I do, Coach? Kevin: I don't know, son. I don't have a sundial. Back in line. It's Derek's turn to run. As Kevin blows the whistle, Derek runs pretty fast. Jessica, Alex, Becky and their friends was the cheering him on. Jessica: Come on, Derek! You can do it!

And they cheering him on. Shane: Come on, bro! Let me see you run! Shawn makes it and goes back in line. Kevin was impressed again. Kevin: 8.0. Good Job, Franklin. Shawn: Preciate it, Coach. Murphy is talking Becky behind her back. Murphy: Hey, Icebox. You look like a boy and play like a boy. Do you pee standing up? Patterson: Nah, when she's hot to trot, she's still gotta squat. Alex got in front of Becky and starts getting angry after they made fun of his cousin. Alex: Why, you little! (Tackles Patterson) Why, I ought hit you for that and you better leave my cousin alone, you knucklehead! Giving him a headlock and strangling him. Patterson: (gags) Get off me! I can't breathe! Briggs: (yells) Get him before he pulls his head off! Everyone start to gather around the fight. Becky was getting impressed that Alex is finally hurting Patterson she wanted to hurt. Just then, Danny and Kimberly show up and see Alex hurting of the boys. Kimberly: (yells) Alex! Get off of him! Shane: Come on, Alex! Chill out, man! You heard you're mama says! Get off him! Danny: Alex, you heard your mother! Let him go! But Alex stills strangles him and 5 seconds. His mother and Danny told them to let Patterson go. Patterson: (gasps) I can't breathe. Alex lets him go, Patterson stands up, and Alex says it angrily. Alex: (angrily) You're lucky my mom and uncle showed up! Kimberly has a angry look on her face, but she calms down and walks with Danny and Jessica wave her hand says hello to Danny and Kimberly. Jessica: Hi, Mr. O'Shea. Hi, Mrs. Granger. Danny and Kimberly: Hi, Jessica. They both go to Kevin's family. Danny says hello to Karen and Priscilla. Danny: Hey, guys. Karen: Hi, Dan. Hi, Kim. Kevin and Karen's younger daughter named Priscilla was on camrecorder and videotaped the fight between Alex and Patterson. Priscilla: Hey, guess what, Uncle Dan, Aunt Kim? I got the whole fight and choking on tape. Here. Wanna see? Danny: No, I'll pass. Kimberly: (Rub Priscilla hair light) No thanks, sweetie. But thanks for asking anyway. Danny: Karen, how they doing? Karen: They're the best ones out there. Danny, Kimberly, and Karen look at the kids, who are all lined up in front of a table full of jerseys, helmets, footballs, and equipment. Kevin then gives them the speech. Kevin: You know, today I'm reminded of what a lucky guy I am. Lucky to have been born an O'Shea. Winks at Danny and Kimberly who nodded. Kevin: (cont'd) Lucky to have been born in this great town. And lucky to have been blessed with the abilities that allow me to bring something back here to Urbania. My town. Little things like… Becky and Alex recites Kevin's words that they remember. Becky: Three high school championships. Alex: A national collegiate championship. Becky: An all-american title. Alex and Becky: And not to mention. Alex: A heisman trophy. Everyone started to cheer and clap while Butz goes, \"Woof! Woof!\" and Kevin continues the speech Kevin: Today, I'm even more lucky 'cause there's one more thing I can bring back to this town: A Pee-Wee State Championship! All the children start cheering and clapping. Becky and Alex give their parents thumbs up and they do it, too. Kevin then raises his hand to tell them to stop. Kevin: All right. All right. Now, when you hear your name called, I want you to go over to coach Butz and I want you to pick up your jersey. Becky: Those jerseys are so cool. Rudy: Dibs on Aaron Rodgers' number. Hanon: I'm getting Dez Bryant's number with the big number 88. Tad: I just want one of those shirts. Alex: I gotta get my favorite number. Shawn: This jersey is dope. They gotta have my number like Earl Thomas. Shane You said it, bro. I gotta get number 24. Me and you gonna like legion of boom. (High five to Shawn) Derek: Man, I'm gotta get Rob Gronkowski's number and definitely with my name on it. Kevin calls there names to Briggs, Patterson, Hoffs, Lewis, Bookman, Grabelski, Rivera, Scanlon, Parkhurst, Lindemann, Beauregard, Walker, Gibbs, and Greeson. Kevin continues calling out the names of the kids, except for Alex and their friends, including Becky, Rudy, Tad and Hanon. Kimberly and Danny were getting confused. Jessica are feeling bad for them. Alex, Becky, and the other kids were getting sad faces. There's one last name to Kevin. Kevin: And last but not least, the backbone of this team... Shawn Murphy! Murphy excited that he has been chosen. Murphy: Yes! I knew it, Becky! And you too, Alex! Whoo! Yes! Thank you! Whoo! I knew it! Murphy grabs the last jersey and went to go join his friends. Alex, Becky, and the others are all sad that they didn't get picked for the team and now Kevin has something to say with other kids who did not to get picked for a team. Kevin: Now, for the rest of you, I'd like to say... well, I'd just... I'd just like to thank you for trying out. And I want you to remember, hey, there's always next year. All right. (To Butz) Let's go. Kevin then walks away. All the kids lower their heads in sadness. Rudy makes his Reeses puff bag spill on the grass. Jessica, Kimberly and Danny then come over to see them, not knowing what to say. Jessica hugs Alex. Danny: You okay? Well, I think this really sucks. There's nothing we can learn from this, is there? Tad: (cries) Yeah. Never try out for anything again. Danny puts his hand on Tad's shoulder and then Becky's, who is the saddest. Tad then walks to his parents. Hanon covers his eyes and then runs to his dad. Kimberly hugs Alex, who is tearing up a little. Derek lowers and shakes his head and even throws a fit. Derek: Damn it! It's ain't right! Shane: (yells) That stupid coach! I really wanted to be on the team! Jessica: Well, he did say there's always next year. Shawn (grumbles) I'm sick of \"There's always next year\" bullshit! Kimberly continues to hug her son while Danny is trying to comfort his daughter. They both need to have a confrontation with Kevin. On the parking lot, Kevin is about to leave. Danny and Kimberly go to him. Kimberly: (shouts) Kevin O'Shea! Kimberly and Danny go to Kevin who is about to get in his car. Danny: So what the hell you think you doing? Kevin: I'm putting together a championship football team, little brother and sister. Kimberly: What about those other kids? Did you just see the looks of their faces? Kevin: Football isn't about faces. It's about speed, about talent. I picked the best ones. Besides, I only got 3 weeks to put this thing together. I can't be wasting my time with a bunch of… Butz: Losers. Kevin told Butz to stay out of family conversation and let Kevin finish talking. Danny: Who the hell are you? Vince Lombardi all of a sudden? Kimberly: Danny's right, Kevin. This is Pee-Wee Football, not the goddamn NFL. Every one of those kids should have a chance to play. Butz: Not on the team. Kimberly: (angrily) Will you shut up, Butz! That is none of your damn business! Danny: (To Butz) Nobody's not talking to you, Butz. This is A-B conversation and you can \"C\" your way out of it. (To Kevin) And what about Becky and Alex? They're better than half of those boys. Kevin: Danny, I hate to break it down to you, but Icebox is a girl. Maybe if you started treating her like a girl, she'd start acting like one. Danny: Oh, Bullshit, Kevin. Don't tell me how to raise my daughter and my nephew. Kevin: Don't tell me how to pick my squad. Kimberly: And what about my son? Years ago, you told me when my son grows up, he'll be a football player just like me. And also, you told me you would pick him on your team. Why didn't you? Kevin: Well, I hate to tell you this, Kimmy, but Alex is short. He'll get hurt and run over. (Kevin gets in his car) Danny: Way a go, Kevin. You hurt their feelings. You know that? Kevin: Danny. Kimberly: Come on, Kevin, can't you listen one second. Now, read my lips: I said you hurt their feelings. Kevin: Guys, we all know those kids can't cut it. What am I supposed to do? Lie to them? Build up their hopes? Trust me, it's better this way. (Starts his car) You'll thank me tomorrow. Puts on his sunglasses and smiles at them. Kevin: I knew you'd see it my way. Kevin then drives away, leaving Danny and Kimberly hurt too. Butz laughs at them as he's getting in his car. Kimberly and Danny then take Becky, Alex, and their friends back home. As they drive by, they pass a sign that says, \"Welcome to Urbania, home of the great Kevin O'Shea.\" TO BE CONTINUED... What is gonna happen to the Becky, Alex and their friends? Will they ever get picked or get to play football? We going have to find out more in the next chapter, Sports Fans. Until in the next chapter. Make Comment if you like to. Until next time. See ya!

Karen was concerned that Kevin that Becky, Alex, and their gang did not get picked. Karen: You know, I still don't understand why you didn't pick Becky or Alex. Kevin: Yes, you do, Karen. Karen: Well, it's not good enough, Kevin. They're your niece and nephew, and they're one of the best players out there. Priscilla: Yeah, and they can make boys cry. Kevin: Honey, for two reasons. One, she's a girl and two, Alex's too short. Karen: And girls can run countries, they can sit on the supreme court, they can discover radium, and short kids are smart, cute, brave, and strong, but they can't play Pee-Wee Football. Kevin: Correct. Karen: (whines) Oh, Kevin. Kevin: All right, honey, look, maybe I went a little too far, maybe I've been a little... Karen: (interrupted) Pigheaded? Chauvinistic, maybe. Kevin came up the suggestion that what the team needs is cheerleaders and team supporter. Kevin: All right. You've proved your point. The point is, I think Becky and Alex should be involved with the team. Karen: Really? Kevin: Yeah, or any girl who wants to be. (To Debbie) Debbie, get your friends on the horn. Tell them I need girls with spirit. I need pom-poms. I need cheerleaders! Debbie: (excited) Yes! But not only that Kevin needs a person who can support his Squad of the team. Debbie: But that's not all, Alex could at least be on your team, Dad. But you wouldn't let him play for your team. I suggest he would make him be either a waterboy or equipment manager and he could work for free, so that he can support your team. Kevin: (excited) I like it, honey! You gave me a great idea and I can do that. Thank you, Debbie. Karen gives him an annoyed look and Kevin shrugs, like he's saying, \"What?\" Karen: (disgusted and annoyed) Debbie! Debbie: (whispers) Sorry, Mom. Kevin: Don't worry, honey. Debbie did the right thing to gave me an idea. Anything can happen. Karen gets up out of the chair walks out of the dining room with her anger and shake her head with her mouthing words \"Oh, Kevin.\" Debbie talks to herself and confused. Debbie: (confused) What did I say wrong? Meanwhile, At Danny's house, Danny, Kimberly, Alex, and Becky are having lunch. Becky and Alex are still upset. Becky: (grumbles) I hate not being picked. She sits down on the chair and so does Alex. He also agrees with Becky that she was saying. Alex: I'm with you on that one, cuz. Danny tries to come up withideas to cheer them both up. So, he goes to them and talks to them about things. Danny: Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we go put some mud tires on the go-cart? Becky: Nah, I don't want to. Danny came up another idea. Danny: All right, forget the tires. How about if we go camping in the woods, huh, make moose sounds? Alex: Nah. No thanks, Uncle Danny. Danny: Ah, forget the moose sounds. Danny and Kimberly came to the kids, sits down and talks to the kids about making the choice that what they want badly. Danny: Listen, kids, remember what (To Becky) your mom and (To Alex) your aunt said that she was going to have to do what was best for her? Well, when she chose to leave us, she was kind of making a choice for us, too. I mean, in a way, it gave us a chance to get real close, you and me, right? Becky: Yeah. Kimberly finishes their conversation talks to the kids about making the choice that what they want badly as well. Kimberly: When your Uncle Kevin didn't pick you two for the team, it was kind of the same thing, 'cause in a way, he freed you two up to be picked for something else or to do something totally different where you could do the picking. Alex: Mom, we just want to play football. Danny: Hey, kids, if I had a football team, I'd pick you. They both smile at him and Kimberly hugs Alex and just sighs, wishing she could do something. Becky: By the way, Aunt Kimmy. Can you be an assistant coach or defensive coordinator? Alex: Yeah, Mom. For my Dad since he died in the plane crash. Kimberly: Well, I'll have to think about this one. But I'll do both at the same time. What do you say? Becky: (smiles) Cool. Alex: Thanks, Mom. I like that. Kimberly: Hey, wait! Where your going, guys? Alex: I'm going tell my friends and inform the news. I gotta go! Becky: Hey, Alex! Wait for me! Danny smiles at Kimberly and put his arm on her shoulder for a nice idea for her. Scene changes to show a flag with the skull and crossbones hanging. In a wooden cabin, Shawn, Derek, Rudy, Tad, Hanon, Shane, Jessica, and another kid name Nubie (He is working on experiment) and are sitting around, and they are still upset that they didn't get picked. Tad: We never get picked for anything. Rudy: Life stinks. Hanon: Yeah, there goes my shot at the pros. Now I'm gonna have to be a senator. Derek: Well, I guess it is bad. Shane: I wish we should've got picked, man. We're all good in football. Shawn: Those other fools were lucky and we weren't. Rudy: Here's a kiss for Murphy and one for Patterson, Rivera, Greeson, and Briggs, too. (farts) Tad: That's a good one, Zolteck. (laughs) Hanon: (Fans his face) Whoo! Whoo! (chuckles) The other kids laugh too and had to cover their noses a little. And then, Murphy, Briggs, Patterson, Rivera, and Greeson come in and they smell the fart. Briggs and Patterson: Ugh! Shit! Rivera and Greeson: Man, it reeks! Murphy: Ohh! Damn, Zolfart. What kind of road kill does your mom feed you last night? Rudy: Free-range skunk. Shane: Shit, it's these dudes again. Derek: Who invited them? Jessica: What the hell do you guys want anyway? Nubie: This is a private establishment, gentlemen. Shawn: Y'all fools need to get the steppin'! Tad: (Steps up) Yeah. Scram! Murphy and the Cowboys gives him a glare. Tad: Please? Murphy: I'm hurt. I'm really hurt. Rivera: Yeah, I'm with you on that, bro. Greeson: Hey, guys, my main man Briggs really got something to say to you, dudes. Briggs: Yeah, we just came by to tell you guys how incredibly sorry we are that you didn't make the team. They all look at each other and smirk. The Cowboys: Not! Briggs and Patterson go to the kid and they pull his underwear up, hurting him. He yells in pain. Jessica: Okay, that does it! When Alex and Icebox get here, they're going to give you an ass kicking. Big time, you guys! Shane: That's right, fools! And they're gonna get your asses, too! Just then, Becky and Alex arrive in their go-carts. Murphy hears them coming. The Cowboys: The Icebox and Shorty! Greeson: Oh, shit! Let's bail, guys! Rivera: Let's get the hell outta here! Derek: You guys in trouble now, homes! They all run out and get their helmets on and get on their bikes and ride off. Alex and Becky sees them and chases after them. Their friends see them and cheer on as they chase after the bullies. They ride down under the bridge and into a creek. Murphy, Briggs, Rivera and Greeson cross the water. Just before Patterson could cross, Becky rams into his back tire and makes him fall into the creek. They cross the creek and continue the chase. Alex comes up on Rivera and Greeson and rams into their tires and makes them fall off their bikes and land on mud puddles. Alex laughs and continues the chase. Murphy looks to see them still behind them. Becky and Alex starts to gain on them. They jump over a log and they go under the log. Becky go beside Briggs and she sees her tail flag and she uses it to make Briggs lose balance on his bike and he loses control and falls on the ground. Becky smiles and she and Alex chase after Murphy. Murphy tries to go faster, but Alex and Becky start gaining on him. They both come up on his back tire. Murphy sees this and tries to turn, but they ram his tire and makes him hit a log and he flies off and he lands into the river. They both stop their go-carts and Murphy comes out of the water and he takes off his helmet and throws it as he faces them. Murphy: Sure. Big shot on the go-carts. I'd give anything to get you both back on the field. Alex: Don't worry, Murph. You'll get your chance. Murphy: Yeah, sure. Remember, you and your spaz patrols didn't make the team. Becky: Yeah, well, we got a little news flash for you. We started our own team, and we're going to kick your little cowboy butts. Murphy: If you got a team, who's your coach? Becky: My dad. Alex: And my mom is gonna be the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. Murphy: (laughs) Your dad? And your mom, too? (laughs) That made them angry. They turn their go-carts and make mud land on Murphy as they leave. At O'Shea Chevrolet, he sells a car to a couple. Kevin: You know, there's a few times in a man's life when he can howl at the moon. When he gets married, when he scores the winning touchdown in a big game, and when he buys his first Chevy. (Hands them a football and shakes their hands) Congratulations. Customer: Thanks, Mr. O'Shea. Kevin: Butz. Butz then takes a picture on them together. Kevin: (To Butz) Harold, I'm going to lunch. You want to surprise me today? Butz: Yeah. Kevin: Sell a car. Butz: (Thumbs up) Okay. Sure. Kevin then gets in his car and drives off to a cafe. In the cafe, people are eating and drinking. Kevin is sitting down, talking to old men. Kevin: We're down by six points. It's third and goal, 2 seconds left. I've been hit so many times, I can't even see straight, I'm busted up, I'm bleeding, I'm so bruised, and I look like a code blue. Old Man #1: Two seconds? I thought it was four. Old Man #2: Could have sworn it was three. Kevin: Fellas, believe me. It was 2 seconds. Now the crowd in the stadium is going nuts. All eyes are on me. I know... Just then, the mayor comes in. Mayor: Howdy, gents. Old Man #2: Already voted, mayor. Mayor: (To Kevin) O'Shea, I got my tail in a trap. We got to talk. Kevin: Excuse me, boys. A little pee-wee business. (Goes to the mayor) Old Man#1: 4 seconds. Old Man #2: The heck with the time. You don't even know what year it is. Old Man #3: No. Kevin and the mayor then sits down in an empty table. Mayor: I'm, uh, feeling kind of foolish, son. Kevin: Maybe it's the tie. Mayor: (Folds his tie) Never mind the tie. Now we got a turd in the punch bowl. Kevin: What? Mayor: I got Urbania into the Pop Warner league by telling everybody that the great Kevin O'Shea was going to be coaching our boys. Kevin: Yeah? Mayor: I just got a phone call. Seems there's two teams in this town. Kevin: (Raises a eyebrow) Who's coaching the other one? The mayor looks behind him and Kevin looks to see Danny and Kimberly come in. Danny: Hey, fellas. Good morning, Louise. Kimberly: Hi, everyone. Louise: How you doing, champs? Kevin couldn't believe it. His own brother and sister are making a team, without telling him about it. He looks back at the mayor who looks down. Becky and Alex comes in. When they see Kevin, they run to their parents. Becky: Dad! Alex: Mom! Danny: Hi. Kimberly: Hi, Alex. Becky: We got to tell you something. We took your advice. Us and the guys, we're forming our own football team. (Kisses Danny's cheek) Love you a lot, Dad. Alex: Love you, too, Mom. (Hugs her) They both run out of the store as Kevin gets up and goes to Danny and Kimberly. Kevin: (Sits down beside them) Are you two trying to make me look like an idiot? Where the hell do you both come off trying to put together another team? I mean, what makes you both think that you can coach football? Danny and Kimberly look at each other and look at their kids, who is begging them to help them. Then their friends show up and want to hear the news. Danny just sighed and looks back at Kevin. Danny: Kevin, we just heard about this... Kevin: (interrupted) Danny, I don't want to hear about it. Kimberly: They just told us... Kevin: (interrupted again) No, guys. Listen. You guys can't coach football. Hell, you guys couldn't even play football. Danny: Whose fault was that? Kevin: Well, it wasn't my fault. Don't change the subject. Listen, who said life was fair? I mean, some of us run for touchdowns, some of us run the class projector. Kimberly: And what the blue hell is wrong with that? We ran the class projector. Kevin: I'm sure you two were great projectionists. Danny, Kimmy, listen to me. People like you and kids like that, they can't help it they're no good, You know, but they learn things. I mean, they invent things. They win nobel prizes. Einstein. Could he catch? Did anybody care? No. Guys, listen to me. Listen to me, guys. I mean, listen to me. These things that you do with the kids. I mean, I think they're great. I think they're admirable. You want to start a chess club, a little nature walk class, this is fine. (To Kimberly) And you, Kimmy. You're a P.E. Teacher. You could at least coach the soccer team or softball team for women. Kimberly: For two reason, Kev. One, they don't even have a team at my elementary school. And two, I'm a substitute P.E. Teacher. Remember that. Danny: So, let us get this straight. It's okay with you if we do something with the kids? Kevin: Sure. Kimberly: But not football. Kevin: Exactly. (Stands up and pats them both on the shoulders) I knew you'd see it my way. After hearing that, Danny and Kimberly start thinking. After a moment, they finally couldn't take it anymore. Kevin broke his promises many times and it was time for it to stop. Danny: No, we don't. Kevin: Pardon me? Danny: We don't see it your way. Kimberly: We've really never seen it your way. We hate your way. That's your problem, Kevin. If you can't have things your way, no one can. Kevin: Now, what's gotten into you two? Danny: (Stands up with Kimberly and faces him) What's gotten into us? I'll tell you. You've gotten into us, and we're sick of it. They look at the kids, who are smiling. They know they are gonna play. Kimberly: You know what? I got some news for you, Kevin O'Shea. Kevin: Tell me something good, my sister. Kimberly: Danny and I forming our own team. Kevin: (laughs) Bad news, guys. League rules clearly state one town, one team. Can't have two teams at the same state and town. Kimberly: Kevin, for your information, New York has two teams. L.A. has two teams including Anaheim Ducks. Hell, even Chicago has two baseball team. So make it happen, my brother. Kevin: Okay. Okay. Whatever you say, Kimmy. (annoyed) Damm it! You such a smart-ass. Old Man: Let's have a play-off. Old Man #2: That's a great idea, Wilbur. How about it, fellas? Danny: How about it? 2 Saturdays from today. At 12 noon. Meet me at half court. Becky: It's the 50 yard line, Dad. Danny and Kimberly go to the door to see the kids. Kevin looks at them. Kevin: Hey, guys. Both of you don't stand a chance. Kimberly: Hey, whoever said we want to win? Danny: We just want to play. They go outside to the kids. The kids celebrate, now that they can get to play football. Danny and Becky hug each other as Alex and Kimberly do the same. Kevin just shook his head and goes to sit down. The two old men then give each other a high-five. TO BE CONTINUED... Becky, Alex and their friends are now gonna play football. Will they win? What would happen next? Like I said we're not even telling. Looks like we're going have to find out in the next chapter. Until later. Comment me if you like to. Until next time. Peace!

This movie belongs to Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. I owned Kimberly Granger, Alex Granger, Derek Martinez, The Franklin Twins (Shawn and Shane Franklin), Jessica Walker, Arnold Wheatley, Eddie Cunningham, Alicia Williams, Tommy and Blossom Valentino, and Anjali Bhrama because those are OC Characters. But not characters from the movie that I owned. Becky, Alex, and their friends are walking down a railroad track, trying to find some kids for their team. Becky: Where are we going to find anybody for the team? Hanon: I don't know. Alex: Someone who's good, not at basketball, but like... Derek: (interrupted) Are you guys joking me? Shawn: Nah, man. We ain't playin', Derek. We just tryin' to find some players. Shane: For real, bro. Then they hear clatter. They go to their right and see an Japanese-American kid named Marcus Watanabe kicking balls off of cans. He kicks one and it hits the wall and flies into the air. They all look at it as it flies. All: Whoa! Then the ball comes down and hits a window on a door and it breaks it. Marcus: Nothing but glass. Becky: Hey, you want to play football? Marcus says yes. As they talk, Alex and his friends hears more kids and look at the left side and see kids playing football. And one of kid is Caucasian boy who has dental braces, blonde long hair, and he wears a red tank top shirt and grey sweatpants. The boy name is Arnold Wheatley. They are playing football for fun. They are good players. Alex and his friends were watching them. Arnold throws the ball high in the air and his best friend, Eddie Cunningham (He is African-American with a high top fade hair with twist curl sponge, also he's wearing the Minnesota Vikings jersey #11 - Daunte Culpepper, and blue short jeans) runs to catch it. And along with Eddie's cousin, the girl named Alicia Williams. (She is African-American girl with long length braids, also she's wearing black and white stripes shirt, and blue short jeans. She also has dental braces like Arnold's) The ball comes down and Eddie catches it. Alex and his friends couldn't believe it. Arnold: Good catch, Eddie. Eddie: Thanks, Arnold. Alex: Hey! Arnold, Eddie, and Alicia turns around to see Alex and his friends going to them. Derek: That was good playing. Eddie: Oh, thanks. Who are you guys? Alex: I'm Alex Granger. These are my friends, Derek Martinez, Jessica Walker, and The twins: Shawn and Shane Franklin. Derek, Shane and Shawn: Sup'? Jessica: Hi. Arnold: Nice to meet you, dudes and dudette. I'm Arnold Wheatley. (Gives them a handshake) This is my friend Eddie Cunningham. Eddie: Good to meet y'all. (Give them a handshake) By the way, guys. This is my cousin Alicia Williams. Alicia: Hey, guys. (Give them a handshake) Jessica: You all want to play real football? We're putting together a team. You want to join our team? Alicia: I'm with you. (To Arnold and Eddie) How about you, guys? Arnold and Eddie look at each other and they nod their heads and so does Alicia. Arnold and Eddie: Let's do it! Alex: Come on. Since Arnold, Eddie, and Alicia joins with them to form a football team, Danny and Kimberly are talking to Nubie, who is playing chess. Nubie: Look, Mr. O'Shea and Mrs. Granger. I have an aversion to pain and suffering. Danny: Nubie, we're not even talking about setting foot on the field. We need somebody to help me coach, you know, to come up with some plays. Nubie: (stops playing and looks at them) What kind of plays? Kimberly: Creative plays. Nubie: Anything goes? Kimberly: Well, use your imagination. Besides, I can use you as an offensive coordinator for our team. What do you say? Nubie: (Sighs and finishes the game) I'm in. Kimberly: You got yourself a deal, Nubie. (She shake Nubie's hand firmly) Nubie meets up with his friends and they all continue walking down the railroad. Next, Alex, Becky, and their friends hears more kids and look at the right side and see the girl who drops and kicks a football. And this Indo-American girl named Anjali Bhrama (Who wears gray t-shirt with UK flag, long blige jean shorts, eyeglasses, her hair is long ponytail, and she has a hearing aid because she is deaf (hearing impaired)). They suprised because they need a punter on the team. Becky: (shocks) Oh, my god. Alex, look at a girl. Do you think they need a punter on the team? Alex: Only one way to find out. Jessica: Well, let's ask her. (Yells) Hey, do you want to play football. She didn't respond because she's deaf. Alex: Jessica, I don't think she can hear you. We might wanna come closer. They come closer to Anjali and Becky taps on her shoulder. Becky: (Taps on Anjali's) Excuse me, my friend, I said do you want to play football? Anjali: (Turns around) What? Alex: Allow me, cuz. (Alex using american sign language to speak) Hey, my friend, my friends and I forming our own football team, do you want to play football? Anjali: (sign language) Absolutely, I want to play football. Becky: Great you can be our team. By the way, what's your name? Anjali: What? Alex: (Sign language) What's your name? Anjali: (Sign language) Anjali. Anjali Bhrama. My friends call me Anju. Alex: (Sign language) Well, very nice to meet you, Anju. I'm Alex. (Shakes her hand and continues speaking sign language) and these are my teammates. This is my cousin, Becky. And these are our friend: Derek, Shane, Shawn, Rudy, Tad, Hanon and Jessica. Anjali: (Sign Language) Hi, nice to meet you, guys. Alex: (Sign Language) Have you play american football before? Anjali: (Sign Language) No, I don't think so. I played Soccer before. But I've ever heard of American Football before, I watched the games on T.V. few times, and I read about Gridiron Football. I like to kick the ball and throw the ball like a Quarterback. Alex: (Sign Language) Well, that's a good experience for you and you get really skills, Anju. So, you with us? Anjali: (Sign Language and smiles) Yeah, I'm in. Alex: (Sign language) Great. (Shakes her hand) You can be on my team. Anjali meets up with his friends and they all continue walking down the railroad. Danny goes to find another kid named Timmy Moore, who is wearing a cowboy uniform and he's wearing a horse ride by a store. Danny: You ever played football? Timmy: No. Danny: Do you like football? Timmy: No. Danny: You want to play football? Timmy: No. Danny: Great. You can be on our team. Timmy meets up with the others on the railroad and walks with them. In a neighborhood, a man in a black suit walks out of his house while he's on the phone and has a briefcase. Johnny's Dad: Yes, that's right, flight 45. Uh-huh. Johnny: (Runs out for him) Dad! Johnny's Dad: (Turns around and kisses his son on the forehead) I'll see you Tuesday, son. (Heads for a cab and picks up a newspaper) Yeah. The flight gets in at 9:00. Don't worry. The boy named Johnny Vennaro just sits down on the steps as he watches his father leaves on his trip. Along with Johnny, his cousins the names are Tommy Valentino (He is Italian-American with black hair and he's wearing black cool shades or sunglasses, black t-shirt, and blue long jeans) and Tommy's little sister Blossom Valentino (She is one year younger than Tommy, also she is Italian-American with brunette long hair straight, and she's wearing thin pink headband over head, pink shirt, and blue short overall jeans). They felt sorry for him and decided to stay with him a little longer. The cab leaves. On the sidewalk, Kimberly, Alex, Becky, and Arnold are walking by. They see the cab leave and they see the kids on the step. Johnny looks down and Tommy puts his hand on his shoulder. Alex: What about them, Mom? Kimberly: (Smiles and looks at them) Hey! They all look up to see Alex and her son coming at them. Kimberly: Hi there, guys. I'm Kimberly Granger and this is my son, Alex. Alex: Hey. Tommy: Hey there, Ma'am. (To Alex) Hey, Alex. Name's Tommy Valentino. This is my sister Blossom and cousin Johnny Vennaro. How can we help you? Alex: Well, you see, we're forming a football team. And we're wondering if you want to join our team? Blossom: Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom. I'm with you on that. Johnny: Cool. Tommy: You got it. They all look at each other. Johnny thinks about it and he smiles and nods, yes. Then Johnny and the his cousins meet up with the team on the railroad track and walk down with them. In a garage, a bunch of equipment is dropped on the ground. Danny: Merry Christmas, everybody! All: Whoa! Shawn: Man, look at this! Shane: This stuff legit, man. All of the boys kneels down to try on the equipment and helmets. While Jessica, Becky, and the girls are in the next room changing. Rudy puts on a Darth Vader helmet as Alex finds a football helmet, and Eddie puts on an old WWII U.S. army combat helmet, while the other boys put on the equipment. Danny: (Goes to another box, to Tommy and Nubie) Okay. There's more stuff over here. Give me a hand. They go to the other box and dump more equipment out and the boy go to them. Danny: All right. Careful with this. Some of these are antiques. Arnold finds an old U.S. Air Force helmet and he puts it on. Shane and Shawn put their pads on as they put on their own helmets on. Johnny grabs some pads and an helmet. Derek puts on his old Cleveland Browns helmet and pads too. Timmy finds a pad and he puts on his mouth. Danny: (To Timmy) Timmy, I'm not sure if you notice, but I don't think that goes there. (To the rest) Guys, a lot of this equipment has been used before. As they continue putting the equipment on, a mother comes in with her little boy named Jake Berman. Rudy sees her and he screams in panic. All the boys look at him in confused. They look where he was looking at. Rudy: Ahh, it's a mom! All of the boys, except Nubie screaming and they run around, trying to hide from the mom, knowing they all in their underwear, briefs, and boxers. Once they hide, the mother goes to Danny. Mrs. Berman: Excuse me, Coach. (To Kimberly) Hi, Mrs. Granger. I'm Cheryl Berman. I'm terribly sorry Jake's so late, but I took him to see Dr. Harding. (Points at her son) He sneezed 3 times this morning and had me worried sick. You can't be too cautious. After all, we never thought we'd have children, not after trying for 13 years. It was me. When I finally did get pregnant, the doctor ordered me off to bed, I spent 9 miserable months on my back. If I had rolled over, I could've lost him. And the birth, heavenly father knows the pain. He weighed only 1 pound, 11 ounces. He spent the first 6 weeks of his life in an incubator, and I think football is just the medicine for him. Danny and Kimberly look at her in a little strange. Danny hears Jake sniffing and he looks at him. Jake: (shrugs) My shrink told her I got to get out more. Danny: (smiles a little) I think he's going to be fine. Kimberly: And don't worry, Mrs. Berman. We're going to take good care of him. Mrs. Berman: Oh, okay. Danny and Kimberly takes her outside. As they takes her outside, all of the boys come out of hiding and they all walk to him. As Tad goes to him too, he sees a tiny bubble coming out of his nose. Tad: Cool. (pokes the bubble with his finger and it pops) Jake: Thanks. I needed that. Eddie: (groans) Hey, man. That's nasty. Just then, the door opens and Becky and the girls comes out with her equipment on, except Jessica because she's still wearing normal clothes. She's holding a helmet with the skull and crossbones on it. Blossom holding the skateboard helmet with the flowers in it. Anjali holding the yellow football helmet. And Alicia holding the hockey helmet with stars and stripes in it. Alex and the rest come out and they smile, knowing they have helped the girls out. Becky: Let's kick some butt. Outside, Danny and Kimberly are helping the kids train and practice. They are all jumping up and down. Danny: (singing) I don't know, but I been told. All: (singing) Butz's butt is green with mold. Kimberly: (singing) You say thank you, I say please. All: (singing) Kevin sits down when he pees. And then, they all work out with weights and push-ups. Jake has two small containers, pretending they're weights and he lifts them one at a time. Arnold and Eddie stretch out their arms and legs with everyone else. Danny: Looking good. Real good. Kimberly: All right. Let's stretch it out. Come on. As they do push up, Rudy pass gas in Tad's faces and they both fall down on the ground. Later, Johnny, Marcus, Tommy, Arnold, Tad, Jake, and Eddie go to Monkey bars. Johnny goes first, but he only holds onto one bar and he falls to the ground. Marcus goes next, he climbs to three bars, and he slips and falls to the ground. Arnold goes next, but he only climbs five bars and he falls to the ground. Tad goes next, As he climbs four bars, but he lets go by mistake and he falls to the ground. Tommy goes next, he climbs four bars, but he slips and falls to the ground. Eddie goes next, he climbs six bars, but he slips and falls to the ground. Jake goes last, he only climbs three bars, and he falls to the ground. And finally, Rudy goes next. He climbs four bars. Below, the others are in a pile, looking up at Rudy, hoping he won't fall on them. He climbs two more and struggles to hold on. He grabs another bar and couldn't hold on. He looks down as he lets go and falls. Below, the others scream as Rudy comes down on them. He lands on them and passes gas. TO BE CONTINUED... All right, sports fan. All they need is a quarterback of the team. Who will become a Quarterback of this team? Find out in the next chapter. Make a comment if you like to. Until next time. ¡Adios, Amigo! P.S. I give Marcus a surname Watanabe. But on this movie, he didn't have a surname. Read and Review.[Chapter 5] An \"extended and alternate version\" of the movie \"Little Giants\".

As for the defense, I signal the middle linebacker with the play. He relates it to you in the huddle. Then, we try it on the field. If you huddle and doing the line of scrimmage for too long, that's a delay of the game penalty. When it comes to offensive and hike the too early, that's a false start pently and as for defense, that's an offsides pently. Okay, let's do it. Junior: Okay, guys.

Derek: Chill, guys. Let Junior do the job! Alex: Hey, Guys! Would you be quiet, you guys! Jake: You suck! Alicia: You guys, hush up! Tad: I want to run the ball! Anjali: (Sign language) Quiet down! Blossom: Calm down, guys! Shane: Guys, shut up and let Junior do the play! Shawn: Chill out, dudes! Everybody arguing about the play. Marcus: You can't go to my birthday party. Hanon: So, what?! Hanon shoves Marcus and so does everybody. Derek: Guys! Stop fighting! Kimberly: Hey, hey! All right, guys. That was good for a first time. Let's try it again, but this time start from the bottom from the top. And please, no more fighting and arguing. Get it right. Cut to the scene, when Junior continues throwing the football. Junior: Ready? Go! Junior throws a football to Becky once again and she is caught it. He give her a high-five. Kimberly: Nice pass. Danny: Nice catch, Becky. Hey, Junior. See you can throw this (gives him a toilet paper) and Hanon, see can you catch this one. (Hanon steps up) Shane: Hey, Hanon. You can do this.

But not characters from the movie that I owned. Meanwhile, Back in gas station while Danny and Kimberly are practicing and when Jessica got there, she brought the bunch of ragtag and misfits girls to become cheerleaders, but some girls are nerdy, soical outcast, socially awkward, (One of the girls wears glasses, dental braces, one of the girls who's wearing hearing aids (for hearing impairment and Anjali is not the one), one of the girls is fat, one the girls is skinny, one of the girls is small, etc. They never cheerleading before of their lives) and inexperience (Some girls has been cheerleading before, but not much experience). Kimberly: Hey, Jessica. It seems you brought girls for cheerleading the team. Jessica: Yeah. I brought some girls they never cheerleading before in their lives and some girls don't have much of experience, but at least they cheerleading before. (sighs) But that's all I can find and we make the best of it. Kimberly: (sighs) Well, that's okay. You are a captain of the cheerleader of the team. Your job is teach these girls since you have experience of cheerleading and you do the choreography. Jessica: Thanks, Coach. Moments later, Kevin and Butz in the bush on binoculars and spying on Junior practicing quarterback play action. Junior: Hut one! Hut two! Hut three! Butz: Look at the cannon on that kid. Kevin: He's playing for the wrong team. Junior: Hut one! Hut two! Hut three! (throws to Alex) Yeah! Danny: That's the way. All right. Come on back. Nubie is also on binoculars looking at Kevin and Butz spying on them in the bush. Kimberly: That's good, Johnny. Keep your head up. Nubie: (Pats them both on the arms) Guys? Kimberly: What is it, Nubie? Nubie: Spies. Danny: Where? Nubie: In the weeds. Kimberly: Somebody's a little scared, huh? (Blows a whistle) Danny: Okay. Take a little break. Then, we'll start running the super-secret play. I'm just gonna get the diagram and Kimmy, Alex, you come with me, because I need your help. Butz: Coach, they're gonna do the super-secret play. Kimberly, Danny and Alex on the phone calling the state police and tell them to arrest two guys for voyeurism. Danny and Kimberly are pretending are elderly women. Danny: (on the phone) State police? Oh, thank god. This is Thelma May Rogers, I'm 86, I live in Urbania, and there are two men down the bridge from the Shell Station...in the bushes spying on some kids. (Alex fake crying) Kimberly: (on the phone) We're all so upset. I don't think men their age should be parading around in their underwear. Alex: (on the phone) Please, hurry. Danny: Nice going, guys. (High five to both) Alex: Yeah. Butz: This is incredible. They got the guards in the backfield. They... they got the center to the right, and... and the quarterback isn't even there. Kevin: They're standing around, Butz. Butz: Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. The state police appears with the guns and arrest both of them for voyeurism. State Police Officer: Freeze! They both raise their arm up. Kevin and Butz: Oh, shit! Meanwhile, back in Kevin's house. Kevin reads the Urbania Times newspaper says \"Local Hero Arrested\" is furious and humiliated that he was arrested by the state police for voyeurism. Kevin: I'm on a roll, huh? Karen: Your sandwich, dangerous one. Kevin: That's funny. Last night, I go out the window. Today, I'm arrested... handcuffed, humiliated. My own brother. And my own sister, too! Karen: lmagine how I feel married to a peeping tom. Kevin: You gotta give it to them. That was a brilliant move... calling the state cops instead of the local cops. I didn't think Danny and Kimmy had it in them. I will get them back from this one. Karen: This could've been avoided if you'd just formed one team. Kevin: Don't you understand that the people of this town expect Kevin O'Shea to win? Nobody buys a Chevy from a loser! Karen: Honey, this is Pee-Wee Football. Remember? It's supposed to be fun. Kevin: That's where you wrong, Karen. It's not fun anymore. See, all the fun is gone now. See, now... it's war.

Giants are doing the runthrough drill while holding the ball between the two cones and one the players dropping the helmets and picks it up. Danny: Very nice. Looking good. Looking good. Next, The Cowboys are doing agility drills by bending their knee, hitting their own helmets and turning around. Butz: Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. That's right, guys. Make them pop.

Everybody cheering for Jake made it and left them up and the next second Jake falls down. The Giants: Jake? Jake is on the floor. Junior: Uh, oh. Alex: Are you all right, man? Jake: Yeah. I'm okay. (Alex helps Jake to get up) Becky: Hey, Dad, Aunt Kimmy. Can I ask you a question? Kimberly: Sure, sweetie. What's up? Becky: Since we have this equipment and stuff and All we need is a real football equipment and uniform like professional football players does. How do we get a equipment and real uniform? Because everybody is wondering. Kimberly: Well, we don't have any money to get a better equipment. But, all we need is a lot of money for equipment and uniform. Becky: How do we get the money? Danny: Well, I suggest we can do some a lot of funding for the equipment and uniforms. Becky: How do we going to do that? Danny: I suggest we can do car wash to raise money for the equipment and uniforms. Kimberly: Great idea, Danny. I'll tell the team and cheerleaders right now. (To the teams and blows whistles) All Right, teams and cheerleaders. Bring it in and take a kneel! Let's go! The team and cheerleaders go to the coach and make an announcement. Danny: Okay, listen up. Now, this Saturday we are going to do something else. We all know we want the better uniforms and equipment, but since, we have no money for the equipment and uniforms. So, I Suggest that this Saturday... we are going to have a car wash to raise money for uniforms and equipment. And people, I need your help to washing the customer's cars. Kimberly: As far I'm concerned, this practice is over for now and we can call it for the day. I see you in practice tomorrow to do some more plays and we can do it again to crush those Cowboys. Alex: Okay, Giants! Gather around and put your hand together. (gather their hands for team hand stack) And I want you hear loud and clear and we say the Giants. Okay, Ready? Giants on three! One! Two! Three! Who are we?! The Giants: Giants! (breaks away) And that's all for practice today and everybody going home. How do they get the money for the uniforms?

Junior cleaning off the bubbles of Debbie and that was very nice. Junior: There you go. Debbie: Thank you, Junior. Meanwhile, Back in Danny's house at Becky's room. Becky puts on the lipstick and she think about become a cheerleader and pretending to be one. Becky: Give me a J. Give me a U. Give me an N. When Kimberly comes to Becky's room and she puts and the lipstick stuff away and she takes off the the lipstick. Kimberly: Becky! Hey, I got an idea for a whole new defense. I read about a monster-back thing where you run around causing destruction. Are you wearing lipstick? Becky: No. It's a Cherry Tootsie Pop. Kimberly: You don't have to lie. It's okay to talk to me. There's no guys around here. Just me and you and I'm all yours. Becky: Um, Aunt Kimmy. Can I have a word with you in five minutes. Kimberly: Okay. Tell me. What's going down? Becky gets silences for a moment. Kimberly: What's with the silent treatment? Are you on your period or something? Becky: No, not yet and it's not evening like that. But there something I want to talk to you. Kimberly: What's on your mind, baby? You can tell me something? Becky: I was thinking, Um, (pauses) I was thinking about become a cheerleader. Kimberly: (shockingly) What? But why? I thought you love being an athletic. Why would you throw your athletic ability away to becoming a cheerleader? Becky: Since my mom left me and my dad. She used to call me little princess instead of little fullback. Because my mom wouldn't let me play football. I don't think I wouldn't want play football. Kimberly: Now, come on, Becky, it can't be that bad. It's okay to be afraid. It's okay to be a girl to talk about boys sometimes. But you don't have to be an athletic. Also it's not okay to lose your fear. When I was your age, your grandmother told me that \"it's okay to be like a girl but you don't have to be an athletic kid. It's okay to be who your are and as long as are a strong lady. And never go wrong.\" Becky: How do you know all that? You can never beat my Uncle Kevin at everything. Kimberly: No, no, no, Beck. That is not true at all. I did beat Kevin few times. Becky: Since when? Kimberly: When we were kids. Your Uncle Kevin, your father, and I used to race our bike every day at Cherry Hill after school. Kevin kicked my ass most of the time and Danny kicked my ass few times. But I kicked Kevin's ass about 4 or 5 times. Becky: Wait. You beat my Uncle Kevin in racing bikes at Cherry Hill? Kimberly: Damn right, Becky. He ate my dust. Becky: I see. But you never told me you played football and also I never seen, never heard, and never knew about you played football when you was little? Kimberly: Yeah. Well, let me tell you something about a little story, When I was your age, I played football in the neighborhood against Kevin's team. But not in the pee-wee football. One of the boys picked me last. Later that moment, when one of the boys was injured and I finally great to chance to play football since I was picked last for the last resort, so I can prove myself. When I got hurt, I had to be tough and I didn't cry just lIke the boys. So I just walked it off and carried on to finish the game. In the last minute before dinner time, we were down 5 points. I was holding the ball run through the Kevin's boys and all the way to the end zone, and I gotta a touchdown. That was the best game I ever played that I never forget. I proved the boys wrong that I can play football. You see, honey. That's why I proved myself that I can play football in the neighborhood and beat Kevin. And You should do the same but you can do anything you want. You got a choice, sweetheart. All you gotta do is prove yourself. Becky: Thanks, Aunt Kimmy. (Hugs Kimberly) That was a best story I ever heard. Kimberly: Don't mention it, sport. I won't tell your father about it. Becky has a tough decision to make: either she's going to be a cheerleader to join with her best friend, Jessica. Or she'll stay as an athlete. But nobody knows and there's no telling that Becky has to make a decision for her dilemma. TO BE CONTINUED... Would Becky makes a tough decision that she going to stay as an athlete or a cheerleader. We don't know yet. Find out in next chapter. Make a comment of this chapter and previous chapter if you like to. Until next time. Ciao!

When, Danny and Kimberly got here they meet a new kid's father named Mike Hammersmith. Danny: Excuse me. Are you... Mr. Hammersmith: (interrupts) Hey, don't tell me. Which one of you is Coach O'Shea? Danny: Um... that will be me. I'm Coach O'Shea. Mike: Ah! You're Coach O'Shea! Who am I? (Striking a pose like Kevin O'Shea) Look at this. Who am I? Danny: Oh, you're remembering my old playing days. Mike: Remembering them? I treasure them. You're the reason we moved to this town, you and that pop warner football league. (Puzzled) You... you look kind of small for a football star. Danny: That's what they all thought. Mike: Yeah... Anyways. (Looking at Kimberly) Is that your wife? Kimberly: Oh, no, I'm his sister. I'm Kimberly O'Shea-Granger, I'm the assistant coach and defensive coordinator. Mike: Ah, Kimberly O'Shea-Granger. (He shakes her hand) You can me Mikey, dollface. Kimberly: (chuckles) Well, Mikey. For starters, (Squeezing his hand hard very angrily) don't ever call me \"dollface!\" Mike: Okay, okay. Whatever you say. (Chuckles and let's go with his hand) God, I like it feisty. Danny: So, where is your... Mike Hammersmith interrupts again, bringing his son to introduce the coaches, and the new kid name is Spike Hammersmith. Spike: His name's Spike. He's right here. Hang on a second. Spike! (Spike caring the refrigerator on his back) Come on down here. I want you to meet Coach O'Shea and Coach Granger. Look at the boy. (Spike flex his arms) He was bred for football glory. The first skin he touched was a pigskin. Pushing a football across the floor with his head at four months old. Did his first pull-up when he was 18 months. Spike, give me 10! (Spike doing the pull-ups on his father's arm) Runs a 40 in 6.5 flat. Bench-presses twice his own weight. Won the 8-year-old division of the pass, punt, run when he was 5 years old. Guys, I've been cultivating him, grooming him. Every night, before he goes to bed... I massage his hamstrings with evaporated milk. Danny: Yeah. He's quite a boy. Kimberly: On top of that, we can use him. Mike: Yeah. Play to die! (Spike high knees) Knees high! Knees high! Meanwhile, back in Shell Gas Station. Kimberly and Danny brought a new kid named Spike and The O'Sheas can use Spike as a tailback. Kimberly: Okay, guys. Listen up. We got great news. We got a new player. Tommy: Whoa, mama! Alicia: Damn. He looks like Howie Long on steroids. Shane: Who's that dude? Shawn: Shit. Looks like a side of beef. Nubie: Or a genetics experiment gone terribly wrong. Anjali: (Sign language) Hi, how are you, buddy? Blossom: He is hot stud. Arnold: Dude, what's going down? Eddie: Sup, homeboy? Derek: It seems he kinda cool chico. Johhny: Where's his socks? Hanon: Where's his neck? Tad: He's bigger than my dad. Spike: Spike's in hell. Spike's in pee-wee hell. Danny: Guys, Spike's our new tailback. Nubie: Great! Now we can run The Annexation of Puerto Rico. Spike: What the hell is The Annexation of Puerto Rico? Danny: I don't know if we're ready for that. What formation do you like to run out of? Spike: Power-I. Now, who's Spike's lead blocker? Danny: The Icebox. Kimberly: And the Ant-Man is the running back and return specialist. Spike: Where's they at? Becky: Right here. Alex: You better tell me something. Spike: Is Spike mistaken? Aren't you a girl? Becky: Gee, good eye. Spike: And you, short stuff. You kinda too small to play football. How tall are you anyway? Alex: First off, that's none of your goddamn business. And secondly, life is too short to be small to play football. Spike: (scoffs) Whatever. Anyways, Spike don't play with girls and midgets. Danny: Actually, they pretty good, Spike. Spike: Spike don't care. Didn't you hear? Spike don't play with… Becky: (Becky shoves Spike with a ball while she's interrupts) Look Here. I can tackle anything, anytime, anywhere. Got that? Alex: (Fingerpoke at Spike) And on top of that, I can run faster and tackle anyplace I go as I damn well please, you fool. Understand that? Spike: Look, you berserk-o Barbie doll and you wannabe Ant-Man little bastard, when you two mess with Spike... you both mess with death. Becky: Can you walk the walk and talk the talk? Alex: You keep talking to me like that, and I'll kick your ass, you butt-breath! Spike: Try me! Becky: I will! Spike: Let's go! Alex: (Balls up his fists) Put up your duke, boy! Right now! (Spike shoves Becky and Alex) Jake: Somebody call 911! Danny: All right. Okay. Okay. Hold it. Calm down, guys. Becky, wanna get that car for me, please? Kimberly: Alex, I need a word with you. Becky: Why me? So, you can play with this ape? Alex: Yeah, I never like that jerk anyways. (shoves Spike) Excuse me, monkey boy. Danny: Can I have a little word with you, please? (Becky shoves Spike) Jake: Your leg's bigger than my body. Timmy: Howdy-do, Spike? Danny: With this guy, we got an actual shot at winning this. Give me a minute to get him used to the idea of playing with a girl. Becky: You don't think I can take him, do you? This is a bunch of crap. (Walks out and throws helmet on the floor) Kimberly: First off, you need to control your temper and watch your language sometime. Secondly, why don't you give a boy chance so we can win a game against your Uncle Kevin. You want to win this game, don't you? Alex: Come on, Mom. I may be a scrapper one. But I don't think I can get used to this guy playing with him. So, you think you can get him used to the idea of playing with a short guy and I can take him? This is bullshit! (Walks out and throws helmet on the floor) Kimberly: (Talks to herself) I think he needs to blow off some steam and her, too. Next scene at the Diner. While Becky is playing with basketball in the cup with a spoon and Alex is eating burger and fries and drinking milkshake. While they fell bad about playing football with Spike as a new player of this team. Kevin: Hello, Shirley. Shirley the Waitress: Hi, Kevin. Kevin: (scoffs) Hey, guys. Alex: Hey, Uncle Kevin. Kevin: Icebox not hungry? Alert the media. (she doesn't respond) Louise the Waitress: How you doing, hotshot? Kevin: Hey, Louise. Thank you, dear. (To Alex) You don't mind I eat one of your french fry, Ant-Man? Alex: (Scoffs and shrugs) Whatever. Kevin: (Takes one of his fries) Thanks. (To Becky) Good shot. (To both) You both still mad at me for not picking you? Becky and Alex: No. Kevin: I guess you two got your own team now. Alex: It's not our team. It's Spike's team. Well, I guess our parents got a big crush on him. Kevin: Don't be so hard on the old people. It can't be easy on him having me as a brother and sister... or you as a daughter and a son. Becky: (sarcastically) Ha-ha, Very funny. Alex: Why you say that? Kevin: People like you both and me, we're stubborn. If we don't get our own way, watch out. Becky: When you played football you wanted to kill your coach, too? Kevin: Hey, Becky. You can't fault the guy for trying to win. Alex: He doesn't wanna win. He wants to prove he's not scared of you no more. Kevin: So, what do you guys want? Becky: I thought I wanted to play, but now there's all this other stuff. Kevin: What other stuff? Becky: Not football stuff. Alex: I'm think about become an Entomologist. You know collecting insects, learn about insects, take the insects to the museum and something like that, if I don't make into professional football when I grow up. Kevin: That's a start. It seems science is your life. Alex: I think I'm in love with Jessica. Kevin: No kidding? Alex: (sighs) Yeah, I guess. It reminds me when I watched the reruns of The Wonder Years when Kevin kissed Winnie for the first time in the first episode. Kevin: Hey, that's great. I like that. A short guy likes nice tall lady. Becky: (chuckles at Alex) I bet you can kiss Jessica. (To Kevin) Debbie likes Junior, doesn't she? Kevin: Does Veronica like Archie? Becky: She's gonna get him. I know it. Kevin: You know, she'd probably kill me if she knew I told you this... but you wanna find a boy, you gotta figure out how boys think. And if this boy's a quarterback, he's probably gonna want some cute girl... not some teammate. Becky: But I don't know about being a cute girl. I'm good at sports. Kevin: (To Alex) As for you, Alex. It's okay to become scientist, doctor, lawyer, or anything. But you don't have to be an athletic all your life. Being an athletic is great... but... tough, you see, it's all about your attitude, you've got to work hard, and stay in shape all your life if you want to play in college ball and then... the professional. If you don't make a professional, hey, it's always... plan B. Alex: Thanks. Being a scientist is cool, but I love being an athletic and that's why american football is my life and my passion, too. Kevin: Of course you are. You guys are an O'Shea. But listen to your Uncle Kevin. You guys got a lot more to offer than football. A lot more. Becky: You think so? Kevin: I know so. (Kevin pays the tip and leaves) Becky: Hey, Uncle Kevin. Do you think I'm pretty? Kevin: No. I think you're beautiful. Alex: Hey, Uncle Kevin. Kevin: Yeah? Alex: One more thing. If I'm love with Jessica Walker the cheerleader, how I suppose to tell her. Because I don't know much about women. Kevin: Well, Alex. I'm going to say this. You got to tell her how you feel. If you want to ask to go out on the date, just take one step at the time, and let her answer. Get her a nice flowers or something like that. If you... and your girl kiss each other, that's great, but not too fast, just slow down, and take time if you get serious. It's okay, you just be yourself. That's all I'm saying and I don't want to stress you out. Just be yourself. Alex: Thanks, Uncle Kevin. (Handshake and hugs him) I'll do that. Becky: Hey, Alex. Do you think about kissing Jessica and probably going out on the date? Alex: Probably I will one day. But don't hold your breath, cous. I will do that if Jessica and I bide our time. Are you ready get back to practice? Becky: Yeah. Just me a moment. Alex: Okay. Don't worry I'll pay for our meal and it's on me. Becky: Cool. Alex? (Before Alex paying their meal and she has something to say to him) Thanks for paying my meal. You really treat me like my brother that I never have. Alex: Don't mention it. And you treat me like my sister that I never have neither. (Gives Becky a dap) Alex leaves the tip and pays for their meal. Becky smiles at Kevin for his advice and Alex helping her paying her meal for her as a teammate and Becky finishes playing with basketball in the cup with a spoon with one last shot. TO BE CONTINUED... What will happen Becky, Alex and The Giants play with Spike in tomorrow game? Will Spike stays with The Giants? It's only one way to find...In the next chapter. See you next time!

Two siblings going up against their former college football star brother, in the Pee-Wee Football Game. Synopsis: Ever since childhood, nerdy Danny O'Shea and the tomboy athletic sister Kimberly O'Shea-Granger has felt inferior to their brother, Kevin, a former college football star and currently, a car dealership. Danny runs a gas station, and Kimberly is a elementary school substitute physical education teacher while Kevin coaches the local youth football team and he is a car salesman. When Kevin's team rejects Danny's daughter, Becky, because she's a girl, and Kimberly's son, Alex, because he's too small and short. Becky and Alex convinces their parents to start a rival team, though the city can support only one. To prove himself against their brother, Danny and Kimberly begins coaching his team of misfits for a game. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. I owned Kimberly Granger, Alex Granger, Derek Martinez, The Franklin Twins (Shawn and Shane Franklin), Jessica Walker, Arnold Wheatley, Eddie Cunningham, Alicia Williams, Tommy and Blossom Valentino, and Anjali Bhrama because those are OC Characters. But not characters from the movie that I owned. 30 minutes Later, Becky and Alex are comes back to the team. While Kimberly and Danny are coaching the team for practice. In the meantime, they play with Spike to do the play action. Danny: (whistle blows) Okay, guys. Let's make this power-I formation work. Junior: Okay, guys. Power-I formation on 2. Ready? Giants: Break! (Breaks the huddle and goes on the line of scrimmage) Junior: Ready? Set. Hut one. Hut two! Marcus snaps the ball to Junior, Junior gives the ball to Spike but, he bumps to Junior and Rudy by accident. When the whistle blows, Spike gets up disgusted and that was a poor play action. Spike: (annoyed) You call this a team? (Bumps to Junior) Hey, pretty boy, next time when you hand off to Spike... put it here. Boom! (To Rudy) And you, fat lineman! Rudy: You rang? Spike: From now on, you just get your jelly rolls out of Spike's way... unless you want cleat marks up your fat back. Derek: Hey, man. You don't need to get an attitude with your teammate. You need to take a chill, dawg. Spike: Why don't you shut up and none your business, you taco breath. Why don't you take mop head, cornrow kid, and midget boy to play football elsewhere. Shawn: Fool, why don't you take your attitude somewhere else, dude. Before they start a fight, Kevin and Mike approached in the car calling out Spike. Mike: Spike! Come get in the car, son. Alicia: What the hell's going on? Eddie: Don't know, cuz. I'm pretty sure there only one way to find out. Shane: (groans) Aw, man. What this guy wants? Kevin looks and waves at The Giants. Since Mike has found the true Coach O'Shea (The real Kevin O'Shea), he gave the Cowboys Jersey to Spike. Spike switch teams to Cowboys so that he will never see the Giants again. Mike: You're a Cowboy now. Spike: Thank you, football god. Tad: Where's he going? Alex: Hell, I don't know, Tad. I just don't know. Shane: I never really like him anyway. Blossom: How rude? Alicia: Good Riddance to bad rubbish. Mike: You're a Heisman Trophy winner, huh? Kimberly: Listen, Mike, I was said he was Coach O'Shea, but, I never said he was Kevin. Mike: Oh, so you must think you're pretty slick, huh, sweetheart? I can't wait till tomorrow. One more day, baby! One more day. Oh, by the way, if I win and beat you, You can go out with me on the date and I can kiss you, my love. (Blow kiss to her while drive away with Spike) Kimberly: Dream on, Mike. I'll never go out with you, you prick! Anjali: (Sign language) Great! Just great! Tommy: That was just not cool. Arnold: At least now the other guys have Spike. Damn, what a jerk. Eddie: Shit. What we gonna do now?! Timmy: Great. Just great. Johnny: We got nothing. Blossom: Screw him. He is a jerk and rude anyway. I would never go out with... Alicia: (Interrupts) Don't even say it, Blossom. Jake: At least, we got us. Arnold: This sucks. I'm outta here. (Drops the helmet and goes inside) Eddie: Me, too, man. I had enough of this crap. Peace. (Goes with Arnold) Tommy: Screw all of you, guys! I don't wanna play no more! See ya. (Follows with these two and Johnny comes along) Blossom: Wait up, Tommy. (To the team) Do ya realize what you've guys done? Ya could've kill the team! (Leaves the team and goes with Tommy) Alicia: Y'all ain't nothing. The hell with this team and maybe the Cowboys will kick your assess tomorrow. (Leaves the team, too) Anjali: (Sighs with sign language) The hell with it. (Leaves them the team with the team and follow them) Alex: (yelling) Hey, guys! Come back here we're not done yet! Hey! Hey! They did not respond because they walk out on the team because they quit. Tad: Let them go. They probably don't need us, anyway. Hanon: On top of that, we stink! Tad: Because you can't catch, Hot Hands. Rudy: At least he can walk, you crush Jerk. Tad: Hey, Zolteck, have another Pop-Tart. Hanon: Yeah, Fart Boy. Or can't you open your mouth wide enough?! Kimberly: Come on, that's enough. Danny: Can't we all just get along? Junior: Yeah, coach is right. Break it up. Rudy: Oh, shut up, Junior. You're so good it makes us sick. Junior: Hey, you don't want me to play? No problemo. I'm out of here. Alex: Hey, Rudy! Do you realize what you have done? Rudy: You shut up, too, Ant-Boy. You just got cut by your uncle in the first place. Alex: (scolds) You got cut, too, Rudy. Because, you can't run and you be eating and farting all the time! (To Tad) Tad, you can't even run faster! (To Hanon) And you, Hanon, you can't even catch a goddamn ball! Hanon: How about your friends?! (pointing out to Derek, Shane, and Shawn) If they so good, they should be joining the Cowboys in the beginning instead of you! Shawn: This is wrong. I'm out! (Leaves the team and walk out) Shane: Three of you guys are so cold! (So does Shane, leaving the team) Derek: I don't know what to say. You messed up now, homes! (He is leaving, too) Becky: Nice work! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't even have a team. (Becky leaves) Marcus: Hey, If it wasn't for him, maybe you'd stop drooling and play a little more football. The Giants: Yeah, he's right! Tad: (whines) Why can't we all play together? Hanon: Oh, shut up, dipstick! You're probably the main reason Spike quit. Rudy: Yeah, quit bawling, you big baby. Tad: I can cry if I want. It's a free country. I can even do this. (Kicks Rudy in the shin, Rudy in pain, and Danny and Kimberly shocked) Marcus: Nice kick! Danny: Hey, guys, practice isn't over yet. The Giants: Who cares? (They all walk out) Kimberly: (frustrated) Shit! Damn it! What are we going to do now?! Danny: I wish I knew. Jessica: What happened? Alex: (sighs) I don't know. They all quit because Spike quit and so does everybody. Jessica: Why didn't you go with your teammates? Alex: For one, Jessica, I'm not quitting and I'm still standing, I'm strong, and I'm always will be. Jessica: I know you will. Now what about your teammate and how you gonna reconnect them? Alex: Just Leave it to me. I think I got a better idea. (To Danny and Kimberly) Hey, Uncle Danny, Mom, I'll be right back. Kimberly: Where you going? Alex: I'm going for walk for a few minutes. It won't be long. Danny: Okay, Alex. Be back in 5 minutes because practice is not over yet. Alex: Don't worry, Uncle Dan. I gotta cover. In the next scene, Alex searching high and low to find a speaker or special person for help. But how they going to get help? Alex: (Walking and talking to himself) How do I'm going to get help? Now my teammate is broken part and I'm all alone now. But I can't be myself. I gotta get to play to prove myself. When the bus approached. John Madden came here to ask for directions because maybe they got lost or backtrack to tad. John Madden: Hey, kid, you got a second? We have to get to a banquet in Canton, where the Hall of Fame is. And we took a wrong turn somewhere. Look, we started out here on l-7 east. We're coming across here. We went up 104. We took the 49. Then we were gonna take shortcuts. We go 10, 12, 48. Hut. And we have to hit Canton, and we have to hit it hard. And I don't know where we are! Alex: Wait a minute. You're John Madden? The John Madden himself? John Madden: The one and only. Alex: I watched football and you was a commentator on TV. I played your video game under your named from EA Sports you created. John Madden: Yep. Tad: What's he use? I am a dipstick. I never get to play. Alex: Hey, Tad. Tad: (sighs) Hey, Alex. What you doing here and what do you want anyway? Alex: I got someone else to meet. You're not going to believe this one. Tad: Who? Alex: This man. One of the legendary coach of all-time. The guy who created the most popular video game from EA Sports. It's this man. Tad: (shocked) You're John Madden. John Madden: That's right. I was on my way to banquet in Canton, where the Hall of Fame at. Alex: Yeah, yeah. But before you get to the banquet. I need your help with my teammate. Because my teammate needs extra special help. John Madden: What's got to do with me? Alex: If you come with me and I tell you the side of the story. John Madden: Well, hop in, boys. Next scene at the garage where the kids sits down got bored and depressed. Jessica came here to give them a pep talk. Jake: Who's that? Rudy: It's Jessica. Jessica: Hey, guys, what do you doing here? You should be practicing because you have a big game tomorrow. Hanon: We quit and I don't want to play anymore. Shawn: Me, neither. I had enough. Jessica: (chastises) Now, guys. That isn't cool when you quit. You gotta believe in yourself. If you quit, you are losers. Just because Spike quit the team and join the Cowboys doesn't mean you quit because of Spike. He just got traded for a better team. You should know that you're better than Cowboys, you're better than those any players. And You're better than Coach Kevin O'Shea. I don't want to quit and I'm not quitting. You got to have your own heart. Now, no matter what the people say or do. We have to be ourselves. We are the Giants. What you need to do is...prove yourselves and show those Cowboys who we are and kick some ass tomorrow. So what do you say? You with us? (Doesn't respond) Alex: Hey, guys? Rudy: Now what? Alex: Guys, you are not losers. You can't be losers. And Jessica's right, we don't have a talent. What we need is determination. And since you did not listen what Jessica and I'm saying. You will gonna regret this right now. The Giants: How? Tad: Check this out. You guys want to play football? The Giants: Yeah! Alex: (opens the door wide) So, let's play some ball and step up to the game. (To Jessica) By the way, Jessica. You and the rest of your cheerleaders do the cheerleading duty with Judy Trammell and the rest of the Cowboys Cheerleaders. Everybody shocks that the Giants sees the real NFL players in person and they are stars too. As for Jessica, She sees Judy Trammell and Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. The Giants: Clay Matthews. Le'Veon Bell. Antonio Brown. J.J. Watt. Richard Sherman. Odell Beckham, Jr. Rob Gronkowski. Cam Newton. Woah! Judy: Hey, Cousin Jessica. Jessica: (shocks) Cousin Judy. (They hug each other) How you doing? Judy: I'm great. How you doing, sweetie pie? Jessica: I'm doing great! What bring you here? Judy: The boy brought us here and the rest of my the Cowboys Cheerleaders to teaching you the moves I will give it to you and your cheerleaders. You know I'm a choreographer. Jessica: I know. (To her cheerleaders) Ladies, I will like you to meet Judy Trammell, the choreographer and the current Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. They here to teach us the moves. So, are you ready? Giants Cheerleaders: Yeah! Judy: All right, ladies. Let's go! While Jessica and the cheerleaders goes with Judy and the DCC to practice their moves, The first practice of the scene is The Giants are doing the high knees for speed and run sprints. Le'Veon Bell is walking around and teaching how to use speed. Le'Veon Bell: Bend your knee and focus! Come on! Get your knees pumping and pretend you're catching that chicken! (cut to scene running sprints) Run faster! Let's go! Now, speed is a key to play football like any other sport and always use your speed. That what the speed is all about. (To Alex) Nice going, little man. (Fist bump to Alex) Alex: Thanks, Le'Veon. Second practice is run through and tackling the defense. Rudy is doing the tackling on Clay Matthews. Clay Matthews: Take your best shot, dude. Just block me. Rudy: (scared) Uh-uh. Clay Matthews: Come on. You can do it, bro! Rudy: (still scared) No way, José. Clay Matthews: Come on, dude. Don't be scared. All you gotta is run through me. Just run through me, man. Come on. Get the fear out of your eyes! (Rudy gets angry) Let's go! Come on! Show me what you got! Rudy tackles Clay and they cheering on Rudy for tacking to getting fear out of his eyes. Everybody fist bump Clay. Rudy: Yeah! All right. Clay Matthews: All right now. Excellent. Now just remember, football is 80% mental and 40% physical. The Giants: Right! Rudy: (puzzled) What? Next scene in third practice. Cam Newton and Antonio Brown is practicing how to catch and run the ball to endzone. Antonio Brown: All right, guys. This is what we do. When Cam throw the ball to you, all you got to is catch the football and hang on to it. For running, Cam gonna give the football to you and hang on to it. If you drop the ball, that's a fumble. So don't worry about the defense, just avoid the defense when you get hit and drop the ball. Just hang on to the ball when you get. When it come to man coverage, make sure you don't let the defense hold you back and take the ball away from you, because that's gonna cost an interception and you never know what defense is capable of. All right? The Giants: Right! Cam Newton: Let's go! I'll do the quarterback and the rest of you are backs and receivers. Don't let the defense fool you. Ready?! The Giants: Ready! Cam Newton: Ready? Hut! Cam Newton is throwing the ball to Alex, Derek, Eddie, Shane, Shawn, Jake, Tommy, and Blossom and run to endzone new for touchdown. And also Cam gives the ball to Rudy, Tad, Hanon, Alicia, Arnold, Johnny, Anjali, and Marcus to make a run to make a touchdown. And Everybody cheering and give them high-fives to Cam Newton and Antonio Brown. Antonio Brown: Teamwork is a key. Teamwork can be done because two heads are better than one. The Giants: Yeah! Next scene, when Rob Gronkowski teaching about the touchdown dance and celebration. The Giants are doing the touchdown dance and celebrating each one in this scene. (Like Alex is doing back flips, Derek spikes the ball, Shane is running and extended his arms like a jet, Shawn is doing punches and hops and raise his arms out high like Rocky Balboa, and etc.) Rob Gronkowski: Touchdown dance and celebration can be fun. But you can do it for short time. Try not to do it to long or else the coach will fine you and everybody thinks you're showboating. So, when you make the touchdown, do your own celebration. Don't use someone's celebration. But, it's okay you can spike the ball, dance, tebowing sometimes, slam dunk, and any certain of your signature celebration. You gotta use it sometime if you make a touchdown. Next scene Richard Sherman and Odell Beckham, Jr. giving them life lessons talking about believe in themselves and not talking about the looks and the attitudes. But how to play a game for fun. Odell Beckham, Jr.: I wasn't always the biggest. I wasn't always the fastest. I wasn't always the smartest. But I believed within myself...that I was a giant. Richard Sherman: I want you to understand and I want to hear me out loud and clear. I don't want you to be like me or OBJ. Because It's not about the looks, the attitude, the money, and anything else. They don't even care about everything what the professional have. It's how you play for fun. Odell Beckham, Jr.: Every time when you play football and any other sports like baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis, golf, and any other sports, that's how you play for fun. Because football is a sport and that's how you play a game for fun. Richard Sherman: All you gotta do is be respectful to each other, be respectful to yourself, and be responsible for your own action. Like OBJ says, it don't matter if you biggest, fastest, smartest, and all that. All you gotta is believe in yourself and play football in your own heart and soul and that because you...are...a giant! You understand what I'm saying? The Giants: Yeah! Richard Sherman: What? I can't hear you. I said Do you understand what I'm and OBJ saying?! The Giants: (louder) Yeah! After that, Nubie is creating a play from John Madden that he learn from. Actually, he kind of stole from him just like the Minnesota Vikings vs. Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XI. Nubie: He pivots, fakes, chucks the big bomb halfway down the field...to our, hopefully, still wide-open tailback. I call it the annexation of Puerto Rico. John Madden: Not bad. Nubie: Really? I kind of stole it from you. Raiders-Vikings, Super Bowl XI. John Madden: (chuckles) Hey, you are a genius. Nubie: Thanks. But the problem is we don't have a tailback. John Madden: Listen, what if you tried this? Next scene, When Judy Trammell and The Cowboys Cheerleaders teaching and follow the steps. Judy Trammell: Now, girls. Follow the steps like my Cowboys cheerleader doing and smile. Now, start from the bottom to the top. I'm counting you in. (Snaps her fingers four times) Five! Six! Seven! Eight! While Jessica and the Giants Cheerleaders doing the steps. In The final scene of the practice, When J.J. Watt teaching the team about intimidation, while J.J. Watt is holding the ball. J.J. Watt: You know what this is called? (Pops the football deflated) Intimidation. The Giants: Cool. J.J. Watt: Now, tomorrow, when you go to the game... you don't want to be intimidated. So let me see your game faces. The Giants gets an angry faces and grunts. But J.J. Watt didn't convinces them. J.J. Watt: No, no, no. Come on, guys. You can do better than that.

Junior: What's up, Ant-Man? Alex: Sup, J-u-n-i-o-r! (Giving dap to Junior) Junior: How's a hangin'? Alex: I'm just chillin', bro. I'm just watching the couples kissing each other on the rowboat and, I was thinking… Junior: (interrupts) About what? (Alex pauses) What's on your mind? Alex: I was thinking about that I will really want kiss the girl. But I never been in love before. Junior: Who the girl you want to kiss? Alex: Jessica.

Alex: What? (Junior still laughing) (annoyed) What's so funny? Junior: (stops laughing) Oh, Nothing. Nothing. Anyways, I think you need to slow your role a little and you kinda moving too fast. All you gotta do is talk to Jessica. Alex: Talk about what? Junior: Um, I don't know. Like sharing feeling, commitment, or something like that. Alex: (sighs) I'm not sure, Junior. But, It's worth a try. I think I'll get it a go. Junior: Good. And there she is now. (Jessica has showed up) Go ahead and talk to her. I'll going see your cousin. I'll see you tomorrow game. Alex: All right. Cool, man. I hope we win this game tomorrow. (Fist bumps Junior) Jessica comes to the bench and sits next to Alex. Jessica: Hi, Alex. Alex: Hey, Jessica. Jessica: Something's wrong? Alex: No, nothing wrong. But I'm little bit of nervous about the game tomorrow. Jessica: Listen, Alex. We might not win the game. But you and your team gotta play the game for fun and the fans will respect us. And you know I will always be with you no matter what. Alex: Yeah, how do you figure that? Jessica: Remember you brought John Madden, Judy Trammell, and the NFL Players to practice and lectures about how to play football and tomorrow's game? Alex: Yeah. Jessica: That was so inspirational. I am really proud of you. Your Uncle Danny and your mother, too. Alex: I was wondering, how do you know about your cousin Judy Trammell, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders coordinator? Jessica: That was my grandmother's second cousin. My grandmother's cousin husband from Dallas, Texas. My mom and Judy are second cousins. I was following my cousin Judy footsteps and I haven't seen my cousin since the game when I when to The Cowboys game against Redskins in Arlington. Alex: Oh. I didn't know that. Hey, um, Jessica? I just want to tell you that... Anju is deaf and I gotta speak sign language. And you should speak sign language when it comes to deaf-mute people. But she can speak. Jessica: Oh, I knew that. But I know how to speak sign language a little bit. But not much. Alex: I can teach you more. And by the way, Jessica, I Just want you to show you. (Pulls out of necklace dog tag and give it to Jessica) Jessica: What's that? Alex: That my lucky dog tags with my father picture it. My father was in the U.S. Air Force and serving country in Afghanistan. Two weeks before he was honorable discharged, my father was killed in the plane crash on his last battle. Jessica: When he died? Alex: About 4 years ago when I was 8 years old. I wish my father was still alive to see me play football tomorrow. (pauses) And speaking of my football, my father used to played football in high school and college, but he never got a chance made into NFL. Jessica: Why not? Alex: When he used to played wide receiver, about following week before the playoffs in his college senior year, he has a concussion and a neck injury. After the surgery, he was withdrawn from the football career. About two years later after he graduated from college, my dad met my mom since college days, my dad married to my mom after college, and after that, he joined to U.S. Air Force before my mom was pregnant with me. My parents gave me full name... and my full name is Robert Alexander Granger III. My dad called me Alex for short, because I got my first name from my father and my grandfather. (pauses) When I was 5 years old, my mom and dad give me nickname: Ant-Man. Because since I love to read, collecting comic books, and collecting bugs. Also, Ant-Man is my favorite superhero and Also, Batman, Superman, Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Hulk, and even Spider-Man too, but Ant-Man is my all-time favorite. My dad told me and he said \"I may be small but I'm mighty, like David defeated Goliath because the bigger they are, the harder they fall, one day I will have a growth spurt when I get older, bigger, and taller.\" Now it's just me and my mom and I took good care of her. Jessica: Wow. That was sad but deep story of your childhood. I never thought about your father passing and I'm sorry to hear of your father's death. At least you got your mother. She's is very strong woman. And you can be strong, too. By the way, I have something for you. (She gives him a old cross necklace from Jessica and close his hand) Alex: What's that? Jessica: That's my old cross necklace. Just stay focused, this gives to how to be faith to yourself and anybody, and it's just the game and that's how you play for fun. But not only for yourself for your teammates. You may not win the game but you gotta have faith for your team, for your mother, for your family, for your friends, for me, and for yourself. I want you to keep it. Remember, don't lose this one. Alex: Thanks, Jessica. You helped me a lot. I also want you to have it. (He gives her old dog tag from Alex) Jessica: Your dog tag, huh? Alex: Yeah. But that my two old dog tags and it was my grandfather. My father gave me two dog tags for my birthday. But now, I keep one and I let you have one. You do the same just like you let me have your old cross necklace. But that dog tag, for good luck charm. Jessica: Thanks, Alex. (Jessica kiss Alex on her cheek and Alex is very shock) Jessica: What? Alex: I have never thought of the girl kissing me in the cheek just like you, Jessica. But not from the lips. Do you know what else? Jessica: What? Alex: How about a good luck charm for tomorrow's big game. Jessica giggles and they kiss each other with their lips and holding hands for ten seconds. Jessica: (sighs) Um, Alex, there's something you should know. Alex: What? Jessica: (sighs) I think we're moving too fast. But, um… Alex: So, what you saying? Jessica: (Smiles) I been wanted that for long time and that was great. Alex: Me, too. Kimberly: Well, I gotta go. Thanks for necklaces you gave me. I wish you good luck for tomorrow's game. Alex: You do the same. (They hug each other) Alex and Jessica left each other and they can see them tomorrow's game. Next scene Junior walks to Becky who sitting on the rowboat underneath and put his hands on Becky's eyes. Junior: (Put hands on Becky eyes) Guess who? Becky: Who? Junior: Me. Becky: Hey, Junior. Junior: Hey, that's disgusting. It looks like they're trying to swallow each other's heads. Becky: They're doing it all wrong. You have to move your head dramatic, like Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. Like this. Junior: No. In movies, they do that chicken-pecking, mouth half-open thing. Like this. \"Hey, baby.\" (Kissing his hands) Becky: No Way. Junior: Check this out. My cousin told me that her and her boyfriend use their tongues. Becky: Ew! That's disgusting. Junior: I know. Spit swappers. Becky: Yeah, kind of like them. (Jerks her thumb to points them out) Junior: Tonsil hockey. Becky: You know the only problem with kissing your own hand is? Junior: What? Becky: It doesn't kiss back. Junior: You wanna learn how to kiss? Becky: I didn't say that. Do you? Junior: No. I just got that vomit taste. Becky: Hey, we'll have to learn how sooner or later... I mean, if you wanna have kids and get a job and shit. Junior: Wait a minute. You can have kids without kissing. Becky: Yeah. Not even you can't get a job. Junior: Well, I'll become a teacher. Becky: But what if you were forced to? Don't you think it wouldn't be a close friend? What if I get closer to you? You know, for scientific purposes and stuff. (Becky slides by to Junior but Junior slides back and falls down) Junior (scoffs) No way! If I had to learn how to kiss, and I mean absolutely, positively...no way out of it, no matter what, can't get out of it, I had to learn how to kiss...Well then, I think I'd want to learn with... Becky: (interrupted) Let me guess. Debbie. Junior: I don't know. Becky: But if not her, definitely another cheerleader-type, right? Junior: Maybe. I don't know. Look, this is really weird. He's get up and walks out of here But when de does Becky calls out Junior to have something to say. Becky: Hey, Junior. If I was like a cheerleader, you'd wanna learn with me. Junior: But you're not. You're different. You're cool. You're the Icebox. Come on, you're probably the only girl I've met that can beat up my dad. Anyways, I'll see you later. Later that night, Becky goes to Jessica's House while she doing the moves before the game tomorrow in the living room. She's rings the doorbell twice and she needs to talk about some girl thing. Jessica: I'll get it! (She walks up to the door and answering before she's open) Who it is? Becky: It's me. Icebox. She's opens the door and hug her. Jessica: Hey, Icebox. Becky: Hey, Jessica. Do you got a minute? Jessica: Sure. What's up? Becky: Listen. I just come by a tell you that… (She's whispers her ear) Jessica: Okay. Come on in! Becky come to Jessica's House and Jessica takes Becky to her room so she needs to talk. Becky enters Jessica's room and closes the door. Jessica: So, what's on your mind? Becky: Jessica. There's something that I want to tell you. Jessica: What? Becky: Jessica. I want to be on your cheerleader squad. Jessica: What?! Becky: (Covers her mouth, shushes her, and talks quietly) Not so loud. I said I want to be on your cheerleader team. Do you have an extra uniform? Jessica: Yeah I do. Why? Becky: Because. I don't think I'm not going to play tomorrow. I just want to support the team not playing for the team. Jessica: Okay. I been thinking I need an extra girl. Well, welcome to the squad and by the way. Becky: What? Jessica: I really need you help? Becky: What? Jessica: You'll see. By the way, Becky. Becky: What? Jessica: Come on in and let's going to my room upstairs and we can have a girl talk. Becky: Okay. When Becky comes in and closes the door right behind her, Jessica took Becky up to the room, so she can have a girl talk. The scene cuts to Danny's house where he's looking in the mirror and talks trash to himself and Kimberly too. They get ready for a game tomorrow. Kimberly: What the blue hell is wrong with you, Ref? Are you goddamn blind or something? Come on, Ref, why don't you call something for crying out loud? He might took his legs off. What? Come on, Ref, Are you throwing me out? That's not fair, that's bullshit. I'll kick your ass right back to footlocker where you working at. Danny: Oh, hell no, you don't. You can't. This team has come too far to be shot down on a bullshit call. Watch the grabbing, zebra. They're giving him the business. What? You're throwing me out? I'll throw you out. I'll throw your mother out. Alex: Hey, Mom. Hey, Uncle Danny. Kimberly: Hey, sweetie. Danny: Hi, champ. What you been? Alex: I just went out for walk to get some fresh air for tomorrow's game. Danny: Where's Becky? Alex: She's on her way shortly. Um, Uncle Danny, can I have a word with you...like man to man chat? Danny: Okay. How about in the kitchen? Alex: Cool. Danny: Hey, um, Kimmy. I'm going to be in the kitchen and talk to Alex for a minute. I'll be back. Kimberly: (off screen) Okay! Take your time! Danny walks to the kitchen with Alex. Danny: All right, Alex. So, what's on your mind? Alex: Uncle Danny. I really really have some great news and you might going to like this. Danny: Okay. So, tell me the great news. Alex: I know this girl and it's about Jessica. Danny: What about her? Alex: Becky, Junior, Jessica and I went to the park that nearby the pond. Jessica and I sat in the bench and talking about tomorrow's game and stuff. And on top of that, There's something you should know. Danny: What else did you do besides talking. Alex: Like I said. There's something you should know that.. um... um... Jessica kissed me in my cheek and after that, Jessica and I kissed in the lip. Danny: What? You kissed Jessica Walker? Alex: (Annoyed and shush him) Not so loud. My mom will hear you. And yeah, I'm serious. I kissed Jessica in the lips. Danny is laughing about the kissing and stuff. Alex: (annoyed) What? Danny: (Stops laughing) Okay. I'll stop laughing. I try not to laugh. Okay. (breathes) Ohh, Alex. This is the first time you kissed the girl. I think you kinda moving too fast for that but...that was very cool. You become a manhood now. But not yet becoming a man. You know something else, Alex. It's just a buddy to buddy kiss in the lips and some of kids did that for the first time. It's part of the puberty. Alex: Yeah. I get it. But, I'm only 12. Becky and I share birthdays together and we're in the same age. I really can't lead to sex yet. I'm not really for sex. Danny: Of course you're not and it's true. But one day you get older you understand this. Alex: Thanks, Uncle Danny. But there's something else. It's about my father. (Exhales and starting to tearing up) I wish my father was here to see me play football but now he's dead and he never got a chance to see me play. (Sniffs and wipe his tears) I wish I want him back and it's not fair that he got killed in the crash! I wish I was taller by now but now I'm just a short kid but now I really can't football. Uncle Kevin was right and those boys from Cowboys who got picked from the team was right, too. (stammering) I-I-I'm really too short to play football. (small cries) Danny: (Puts his hands on his shoulders) Hey. Hey. Now, come on, Alex. Uncle Kevin and those boys was wrong. It's nothing wrong for been short and life is too short to criticize. Do you remember what your father told you before he died? \"You may be small but you're mighty, Like David defeated Goliath cause the bigger they are, the harder they fall, one day you will have a growth spurt when you get older, bigger and taller.\" and You're father was right. All you have to do It's believe in your yourself and step up in the game. Alex: Yeah, right. (sniffs) I should've belong to the Cowboys... and Becky... and her friends… and my friends, too. You can never beat you my Uncle Kevin at everything. Danny: No, that's not true. I did beat him once and your mom beat him and me few times. Alex: (Wipes his tears again) Since when? Danny: We were the kids. We used to race our bikes at Cherry Hill after school. We race every day. He always beat me and your mom beat me like 8 or 9 times, but one time I beat them. Alex: Wait a minute. You beat my mom and my Uncle Kevin in bike racing at Cherry Hill? Danny: Yes, I did, Alex. Kevin and your mother eat my dust. But I respect your mother, but Your Uncle didn't. I always look out for your mother but your Uncle going against me and your mother. Alex: That as a short story I ever heard. Thanks, Uncle Danny. For standing up to me. You treat me like my father that I used to have. Danny: I always like out for you and you're my favorite nephew. (They hug each other) After the conversation between Danny and Alex, Becky came home with a box. Alex is going upstairs to his room. Becky: Hey, Aunt Kimmy. Kimberly: Hey, honey. Where you been? Becky: Over Jessica's House. Where's my dad? Kimberly: He's in the kitchen. Danny came to the living room and Kimberly is going in the kitchen. Becky is going upstairs with a box. Danny: Hey, Becky. Becky: Hey, Dad. Bye, Dad. Danny: Hang on. What do you got, a victory cake? Half that team's allergic to chocolate. Becky: It's not a cake, Dad. Danny: You can't sneak away without telling me what it is. Becky: It's nothing. Danny: Okay. If my little fullback wants to surprise me that's all right with me. Becky: (shocks) Little fullback? Your little fullback? That's all I am to you, isn't it? Your little fullback. Your ticket to beating Kevin and winning the game. Danny: Becky, what's wrong? Becky What's wrong? Everything's wrong. Do you know what Mom used to call me? Her little princess. When she tucked me in the sheet and she'd go, \"Good night, little princess.\" Then she'd kiss me on my cheeks. Then she'd pull the covers all around me. Danny: And you remember that? Becky: Yeah. She wouldn't let me play football. She wouldn't call me her little fullback either. Danny: Becky, look, Mom's not here anymore. She left us. She quit. Becky: No! She didn't quit. She just found a better team. You know what? I'm not playing tomorrow. Danny: Hey! Wait a minute, Becky! This was your idea. This game was the most important thing in the world to you and Alex. Remember? Becky: No, that where you're wrong, Dad, it was not my idea that game was the most important thing in the world to me and Alex. But this game means everything in the world...to Aunt Kimmy...and to you. (Drops the box) Becky drops the box, runs off the stairs, and starts to cry. Becky was right, \"It was not her idea that game was the most important thing in the world to her and Alex. But this game means everything in the world to Danny, Kimberly, and to everybody.\" Danny picks up the box and he's found out inside the box is the cheerleader uniform and Becky become a cheerleader for the team tomorrow. Alex about to say something to Becky, but she ignored him and walk out on him. As a result, Alex tries to convince to say a word to Becky. Alex: Hey, Becky. I have something to tell... Becky: (frustrated and interrupts) What it is now?! Alex: Hey, cuz. Calm down. I just want to talk to you. That's all. Becky: All right! You got five minutes. So make a quick. Becky goes to her room and she brings along with Alex so she can talk. Becky: You want to talk? Go ahead. Talk. Alex: Okay. I just want something to tell you about that I... Becky: (Interrupted him again with sarcastically) You kissed Jessica in the lips. (scoffs) Well, congratulations. Alex: (concerned) Now come on, Becky, why you gotta be so mean? What's going down, my cuz? There's something wrong with you? Becky: I just don't want to talk about it. Now can you just leave me... (sighs) Look, I'm sorry that I'm took it out on you. It's not you, Alex. I'm just don't think that I don't want to play football tomorrow. Alex: What? Why not? Becky: It's just I want do something different what the girls do. I will be the cheerleader tomorrow and I am now. Beginning to scold, argue and disagree with each other. Alex: (Chuckles and scolds) Oh, no. No. No. No. No, Becky, no! You can't do that! You can't even quit playing football to become a cheerleader! Becky: Yes I am! As you can see, Alex, I am a girl and I can choose whatever I want to choose, I can call my own shots, and you can't tell me what to choose and what I become one! You see? I'm not like the boys who is an athletic! My mom won't let me play football and she called me little princess! Alex: (growls) You know what? You are a damn fool! You know that?! I mean come on, cuz. You are different than other girls, you are an Icebox, you're better than half the boys, you can be buff, tough, and bad. And Look at me I can be small but I'm mighty, I can run fast, and sometimes I can be a scrapper one. I treated you like my sister that I never have. You treated me like a brother like you never have neither. We in the same age and we share birthdays together. Other than that, we are family! That what families do, they fight each other, embrace each other, help each other, talk to each other to contact, forgive each other and make us laugh for joy and sad for sorrows! Becky: You know what? You're right. You absolutely right. I just want to say that I'm sorry that I stabbed you in the back and turn against you, your friends, and my friends! I never have a brother and a sister. I'm an only child and you are, too. But you don't even know about girls and shit. Uncle Kevin was right I'm a girl and I can't play football. Girls can't play football and not even short guys like you can't play football neither. I bet you and your team will kick your assess tomorrow! Alex: (Growls and leaves Becky's room) Oh, this is bullshit! This is freaking bullshit! Goddamn it, son of a bitch! Alex walks out of Becky's room and Becky slams her door and begins to cry. Alex still cussing out, goes to his room, and close the door. Kimberly and Danny sits down on the couch and tries to figure it out this situation. TO BE CONTINUED... Since Becky will not play football tomorrow and become a cheerleader, Would Alex and the Giants will play the game without Becky? We going have to find out next time! That's all folks...for now! If you have a thoughts and comments about this chapter, make one. Until next time, sports fans. See ya!

Derek: Don't worry, Patterson. Show me what you got! Rivera: I'm gonna kick your ass, Shawny Boy! Shawn: Try me, fool! Grieson: Why don't you try to get by me, Shane-O. Shane: I'm pissed off now, homeboy. Junior: Down! Set! Go! When the ball snap to pass. Junior is randomly about to throw the ball to Derek, Shane, and Shawn while they open. Rivera shuts down Shawn and Murphy shuts down Shane instead, Greeson tries to tackle Junior for a sack. When Junior throws a ball to Derek while Patterson shut Derek down. Patterson tackles Derek and the worst part is... he didn't catch the ball and the ball hits the ground. So, that's incomplete pass. Cliff Parson: That's a incomplete pass and we're now fourth down. Derek: (scold) What kind of play it's that, Junior?! Junior: (scold) You could've catch the ball, but Patterson shut you down! Derek: Come on, Junior. (claps twice) Get it together! Shawn: Yeah! We down fourth down and we gotta punt the ball because almost in the endzone. Shane: That's bullshit, Junior. We getting our ass kicked. In the fourth down, The Giants has no other choice to punt the football to the Cowboys and the Cowboys are almost to the endzone. Spike has something to say to Jake. Briggs: Ready! The Cowboys: Break! Spike: I'm gonna rip your head off! Junior: Down! Set! Go! Go! Go! Go! Jake ducks his head down like a turtle. When the punt play starts, Spike grabs Jake's helmet, Anjali kicks the ball to punt, but Patterson blocks it. When the ball rolls and Spike got the ball to recover and run to the endzone to get a third touchdown. Troy Aikman: Hammersmith dives on the ball in the end zone. Cliff Parson: Touchdown, Cowboys! Jake: (tries to lift his head up) I can't see with this thing on! Cliff Parson: That's the end of your first half. The score: Cowboys 21, Giants nothing. Troy Aikman: I gotta tell you, sport fans, could the Giants make a comeback for a second half of the game? Murphy: (Shoves Rudy) I'm not finished with you, Zol-fart. Briggs: Have a nice halftime, girls. Rudy: Look at my back. Is my spine sticking out through my uniform? Alex: It's hard to tell. Johnny: I've lost feeling in the back of my leg. Blossom: Maybe it's asleep, cuz. Tommy: Nobody wake it. Tad: Hanon, call 911. Hanon: I can't. My fingers are stuck together. Anjali: (Sign language) I'm gonna to meditate on this one. Shane: We still need Icebox. Shawn: I wish she could've play football instead of cheerleader. Derek: I think we some serious help... big time. Kevin: Hey, guys, this thing's gone far enough. Let's call it off, huh? Kimberly: No way, Kevin. It's ain't over. Kevin: It's not over. You're sure? Danny: It's halftime. Kevin: Okay, guys. Hey, there'll always be a job for you at the full-service pumps. (To Kimberly) As your you, sis.

Parental description is advised. Summary: The two brothers and their sister start a rival Pee-Wee Football team. Two siblings going up against their former college football star brother, in the Pee-Wee Football Game. Synopsis: Ever since childhood, nerdy Danny O'Shea and the tomboy athletic sister Kimberly O'Shea-Granger has felt inferior to their brother, Kevin, a former college football star and currently, a car dealership. Danny runs a gas station, and Kimberly is a elementary school substitute physical education teacher while Kevin coaches the local youth football team and he is a car salesman. When Kevin's team rejects Danny's daughter, Becky, because she's a girl, and Kimberly's son, Alex, because he's too small and short. Becky and Alex convinces their parents to start a rival team, though the city can support only one. To prove himself against their brother, Danny and Kimberly begins coaching his team of misfits for a game. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. I owned Kimberly Granger, Alex Granger, Derek Martinez, The Franklin Twins (Shawn and Shane Franklin), Jessica Walker, Arnold Wheatley, Eddie Cunningham, Alicia Williams, Tommy and Blossom Valentino, and Anjali Bhrama because those are OC Characters. But not characters from the movie that I owned. Meanwhile, Back at In the Giants Locker Room. Everybody exhausted, tired, and angry that they got creamed in the first half of the game. But this game is not over yet and the Giants could make a comeback in the second half of the game but the Giants thinking about quitting and forfeiting the game. There's only one chance to win the game by redeeming themselves and earn respect for the fans, the team, and themselves. Kimberly: Okay, guys. Listen up. We still got a shot. A couple things go differently for us, we're in it. Alex: Come on, guys. We can do it. All we gotta do is keep your heads up. Junior: (scoffs) Yeah, so? We really creamed them by showing up. Derek: (complains) The Cowboys are kicking our asses. (Points to Junior) Thanks to Junior. He should've throw a ball to me and I would've make a TD. Junior: Come on, Derek. Don't blame me. At least I've tried throw a ball to you and I was afraid to get interception. Shane: So what, man? We all made mistakes and it happens in every single football games in every season. Shawn: Hey, Alex. You was snapped that Murphy talking about Jessica. You got into a crazy fight. Arnold: Come on, Coaches. How would that feel that Kevin O'Shea and the Cowboys creamed you? Eddie: The Cowboys knew they were ready. We still don't have a chance without the Icebox. Alicia: I heard Kevin O'Shea took that deal that. He said (imitate Kevin) \"If you lose, You can come work for me as a equipment manager and Alex will become a waterboy of the team, too\". Alex: And especially Uncle Danny's gas station, too. Anjali: (Sign language) Come on, you guys. We can make a comeback. Let's hope. Shane: Easy for you to say, Anju. Tommy: I still don't want to play no more. So, I'm out. Blossom: Yeah, me, too, Tommy. But I don't know about you, guys. I quit. Marcus: We quit. Rudy: So, call us if you decide to coach softball. Tommy: And also to coach soccer, too. Kimberly: (chastises) Hey, Hey, Hey! Let me tell you something, people. You need to stop complaining and moaning about team. Junior is right, we really showed up. But you don't really know about heart, trust, dignity, loyalty, legacy, pride, power, and respect. We may not be a perfect team. We are better than the Cowboys. Danny and I tried to help you, cared about out, and even stood up for you. All you need is prove yourself. Danny: (chastises) We all made a lot of mistakes out there today. All of us and I am, too. They were ready. They've been playing together in day one. We've been together for few weeks. Let me explain something else to you all, Kimmy and I still don't believe that they're 21 points better than you in the first half. Kimmy and I still don't believe that they're the better team. Kimmy and I would not trade you for them. I want you to hold your heads up high. We got one more half left. We're just gonna have to have faith. All you gotta do is push yourself, guys. What do you say? So, what about the second half? Hanon: Tell them we can't come out. Tommy: Yeah. Marcus: Put us on the injured list. The Giants: (agreed) Yeah. Danny: You know, there's something you guys should know. When I was 10 years old and Kimmy was 9, we put ourselves on the injured list. We never got off. Timmy: Why? Danny: Because we didn't get picked a few times. So, that's why we started hiding under the bleachers. Kimberly: That's why I had some few friends to play football to going up against Kevin. Some of my friends who didn't get picked and haven't get a chance to play. So, that's why I had my own team to defeat my brother for the game to prove myself. Hanon: (To Kimberly) I didn't know you had a team to play against Kevin O'Shea. Marcus: And that's where we belong, under the bleachers. Danny: No, you don't. You guys belong out there with those Cowboys. You know how I know that? Because Kimmy and I belong out there with our brother. Rudy: Give us a break, Coaches. You guys couldn't beat Kevin O'Shea at anything. Danny: No, that's not true. We did beat him once. Jake: Since when? Danny: When we were kids. We used to race our bikes down Cherry Hill after school. We'd race every day, and he beat us most of the time. Kimmy beat me and Kevin several times. But one time, one time, I beat him and Kimmy, too. Jake: You beat Kevin down at Cherry Hill and your sister, too? Danny: Yes, I did. He ate my dust. But for Kimmy, she had my respect to be defeated. Kimmy: Guys, let me tell you something else about myself. One time, at the park outside the school. Kevin and I played football against each other and Danny and Patty supported my team. Kevin and his friends picked on us, but we didn't like to be teased and tormented. My father told me this, \"Nobody like to be teased and tormented, but you cannot pick a fight that someone tease and torment you. You have to walk away.\" (To Alex) Especially you, Alex. You can't be start a fight talking about Jessica wants to be someone's girlfriend and that just one of the guys in Kevin's Team. (To Giants) So anyways, we don't care we get teased and tormented during the game. We down 5 points in the closing seconds of the game. I held the ball, ran through one of the Kevin's boys, ran all the away to the end zone, and I scored a touchdown. That was the best game I ever played that I never forget. That's why I proved the boys wrong that I can play football in the neighborhood and beat Kevin. And You guys should do the same and (To Alex) especially you Alex. In the nutshell, all we've gotta do... is prove ourselves. Tommy: Big deal. One time. Tad: You know one time, at Randy Cooper's swim party, I did a backflip off the high dive. And my brother chickened out. Marcus: Roger chickened out? He's a Marine. Rudy: Oh, that's nothing. One time, at a Spring Carnival. I beat both my brothers in the cow-dung toss. Tad: You beat Matt and Brad in the turd toss? Derek: One time, at my family reunion at the my grandma's house, I beat my brother in 100 Jump roping and I jump roped 100 times and my brother did 99. (chuckles) That's why he fell down. Hanon: You beat Eduardo in 100 jump rope? Derek: (To Junior) Hey, Junior, I'm sorry I offended and blamed you that you couldn't throw a ball to me. Junior: Forget it, Derek. We all made mistakes and you get your another chance in the second half. (Slap hands back and forth to Derek) Shawn and Shane: Hey, Junior. Shit happens. (Arm wrestle hand shake to Junior) Shane: Anyways, Shawn and I remember one time, at the Cherry Hill Park, I beat my sister in the Remote Control Car Racing Competition. Shawn: Yeah, Shane and I kicked her ass in Remote Control Car Racing Competition and we won our first place trophy. Shane: Our sister earns second place trophy, too. Rudy: You two beat Keisha in RC car race? Jake: One time, I went fishing with my entire family. I was the only one that didn't throw up. Johnny: So what? That doesn't make us good football players. Danny: Wait a second, guys. Who said you had to be good to play football? You play football because you want to. You play because it's fun. You play so you can pretend you're Aaron Rodgers throwing a touchdown pass or Adrian Peterson going for a long run or Rob Gronkowski made a touchdown pass after he caught the ball. And even if those Cowboys are better than you guys... even if they beat you 99 times out of 100... that still leaves… Alex: One time. Derek: One time. Shawn: One time. Shane: One time. Tad: One time. Rudy: One time. Hanon: One time. Johnny: One time. Timmy: One time. Arnold: One time. Eddie: One time. Alicia: One time. Blossom: One time. Tommy: One time. Jake: One time. Anjali: (Sign language) One time. Junior: Yeah. One time. Danny: By the way, guys. We're in a fight. You guys are doing all that you can do. Anybody can see that. Win or lose...we gonna walk out of this stadium today with our heads held high. Do your best. That's all anybody can ask for. Alex: No, it ain't, Uncle Danny, with all due respect, you demanded more of us. You demanded perfection. Now, I ain't saying that I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not. And I ain't gonna never be. None of us are. But we have trained hard for a big game in day one. This team Cowboys is perfect. We stepped out on that field that way today. And, it's is all the same to you, Uncle Danny, Mom, that's how we want to leave it. Kimberly: Yeah, you right, Alex. I hope you guys have learned as much from me this month as I've learned from you. You've taught this city how to trust the soul of a man rather than the look of him. And on top of that, I guess it's about time for me to joined the club, too. (To Danny) Danny O'Shea! I sure could use your help. Kevin O'Shea's kicking my ass out there. Alex: Hey, Mom. I can use some speak here, too. And let me speak on this. Kimberly: Go ahead, baby. It's better be good ones. Alex: Guys. Listen up. You guys got to listen to me what I've got something to say. And like I said, you may or may not win without Becky and Icebox. Junior: What are you saying, Alex? Alex: I'm saying I want to earn respect. I didn't come this far to go home empty-handed and we down 21 points. Don't you know why? We don't suck! Kevin O'Shea and the Cowboys suck! I know that bullshit. We're playing with no soul. 'Cause we playing in the first half without Becky and Icebox. Let's face facts. There's only one way we gonna get back in this game. Now what we need to do... is get back out in that goddamn football field and with Becky or Icebox... is with us. Becky and Icebox is in our hearts. (Point to his heart) And it's right here, right now. Everything my cousin was...everything she gave us (Points to his heart) is all right here. Like my Uncle Danny and my mom saying... they ain't that good, guys. We're better. And it means much more to us. You know? When this all started, guys. Our coaches, they said \"we'd be winners.\" I thought he was full of shit, guys. I love you, guys; not only you guys are my friends, you guys like my brothers and my sisters, and so does Becky. I want to be part of the family and you can be one, too. But then we made a team. We've gotta show people something. Our coaches is right. We changed right now. We're not losers no more. What we need to do is go out there and show it one more time. We gotta go out there, throw ball to her, run the play with her, play with her, get into in the endzone with her, and make a touchdown with her. But there is one problem... we might not win this game with her. We've gotta win our respect with her, guys. We've gotta to be ourselves. (To Rudy) Rudy, you made be the fat one or big boned one, you eat a lot and you be farting many times. But you are strong and you got your powers deep down inside of you. Everybody calls you \"The Gas-Man\". Rudy: You got it, Alex! (Arm wrestle handshake to Alex) Alex: Tad, you made be the coward one and you can't run fast. But you got speed and you've gotta have courage. You are the speedster one and they call you \"Rad\" Tad. Tad: Yes, sir, Alex! (High-five to Alex) Alex: Hanon, I understand you can't catch a real football pigskin. You're hands so hot like a fire and you gotta catch the ball. They call you \"Hot Hands\" and think about you caught a toilet paper as a football. Hanon: You darn right, Alex! (Fist bump to Alex) Alex: Derek, you are the Aztec Warrior of the team and you can blast off like a rocket, you fighting fire with fire, and outspoken one. They call you \"The Blaster\"... or should I call you… \"El Blaster\". You gotta be like Rob Gronkowski or maybe Jimmy Graham. Derek: You got it, dawg! (Fist pound three times to Alex) Alex: Shane and Shawn, you two guys are the Legion of Doom. (To Shane) Shane, you are Hawk because you can fly like an eagle and you're light as a feather. (To Shawn) As for you, Shawn. You are Animal because you can maul like an animal and be tough like a beast. To be honest, you are a hard-hitting defensive back of the team. Shane: Hell yeah, man! (High-five to Alex) Shawn: Damn right, bro! (High-five to Alex) Alex: Marcus, anybody call you \"The Toe\". Because you are a soccer-style kicker from the around the world. And you can tackle, too. Marcus: Yes, I am! (High-five to Alex) Alex: Arnold, you can be the metal-head and rock-star dude with an attitude in this team. You are brave and strong-minded. You are \"Iron Man\" Arnold Wheatley. Arnold: Rock on, dude! (Arm Wrestle handshake to Alex) Alex: Eddie, you can be the hip-hop dude and rap-star in this team. You are very cool guy with an attitude and you can fast and free, spirit of the young wild horse. You are \"Fast\" Eddie Cunningham. Eddie: Hey, hey, hey! All right, dawg! (Arm Wrestle handshake to Alex) Alex: Alicia, You are a sexiest woman alive. You can be tough, strong, and brave just like my cousin and you got your cousin on your team, too. You are \"Sugar\" Alicia Williams. Alicia: Correctamundo! (Hugs Alex) Alex: Timmy, you are the fast and the toughest cowboy of the west. You've gotta stay tough and determine. They called you Ironhide. Timmy: Yeah, ain't it the truth! (High-five to Timmy) Alex: Johnny, I understand you father wasn't here for you to see you play a game.

Always remember what I said about the three R's. Understand? Alex: Yes, I am. Just like Richard Sherman says that to me. Kimberly: You guys may be small, but you guys are mighty.

Now here's the play. Wildcat formation on 2. Alex you snap the ball, give the ball to Johnny and go left. (To Johnny) Johnny, Alex is going to give the ball to you to run and you give the ball to me to make a reverse, so you go right.

But, Tad has to have some courage to run the ball and go all the way to the endzone. Junior Down! Set! Go! When the ball snaps, Junior gives the ball to Tad to run. Tad is scared that he gets hit but Alex is covering Tad to get into the endzone. Tad: I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Tad's Dad: Come on, Tad! Tad: I'm gonna die! Danny: Tad! Go! Go! Run out of bounds! Tad stops running to almost the line where that is out of bounds. As a result, Murphy and Spike is running through Tad to get tackle. Tad: Yikes! (He ducks down) Shawn and Shane leap tackles behind Murphy and Spike through the table where the Gatorade cooler sitting on it, and Tad ducks them out of the way. Thanks to the Franklin Twins. Kimberly: Tad! Run! Alex: Come on, Tad! I'll cover you! Go! Go! Tad is running and Alex is following him to protect Tad. Tad is running to the 20, the 10, and all the way to the endzone and the Giants is finally scored a touchdown for the first time in the second half. Kimberly: We scored! Danny: We scored a touchdown! (Double high-five to Kimberly) Cliff Parson: Touchdown, Giants! Troy Aikman: The Giants has scored the touchdown for the first time in the second half. What a run by \"Rad\" Tad Simpson! Alex: I'm proud of you, Tad! (Double high-five to Tad) Shawn: Whoo! That's my man! (High-five to Tad) Shane: Hey, man. You did! (High-five to Tad) Tad's Dad: Oh, my god! My son scored a touchdown. Spike gets up and he helps Murphy to stand up, The Giants still cheering and Karen is cheering for the Giants. But Kevin is shock that she supposed to be on Kevin side and she's stops cheering. Now, for the field goal kick and Marcus is hoping to do it right and Johnny is scared that he would get kick in the groin again, but he's got a supporter and the cup inside of his groin instead. Johnny: Down. Set. Go! When the ball snaps, Johnny is holding the ball, whimpering, closes his eyes and cover his groin. As for Marcus, He runs and kicks the football instead of Johnny's groin like the kickoff in the beginning first half. Once Marcus kicks the ball, he successful when in the goal post and he finally did it. Marcus: Yes. I've done it. (Falls down) Anjali: (Sign language) You did it, Marcus. (Clapping) Becky: (Jumps) Yeah! Yeah! The Giants gets a touchdown and a field goal and the scored is 21 to 7, but the Cowboys are still in the leads, but don't hold back, the Giants will make a comeback. In the nutshell, Mike has a plan to do something rash. Mike: All right, Spike. We're not taking any chances. All right? Either you take Junior Floyd out of this game, or you'll be donating a kidney to Aunt Ruth. You understand? Spike: Yes, sir! Mike: Okay (Kisses his forehead), get going. As Anjali is doing the kickoff, the Giants are kicking off and that kick was a squib kick. The Cowboys are back on offense. Patterson picks up the ball and run. Junior tackles Patterson, but after the whistle blows by the referee, Spike runs through Junior and tackles him in the back and that was an unnecessary roughness. Sadly, Junior is injured and he on the sideline. Shawn: Shit! Shane: Damn! Derek: Come on, man! That was wasn't even necessary! Referee: Personal foul, unnecessary roughness. Number 32. White. Spike: (arguing) What?! Are you crazy? What kind of call is that? A sack? Are you blind? Jake: That wasn't nice, you big bully! (Shoves Spikes) Spike: Do something about it, four eyes! (Shoves Jake) The referee breaks up the fight. Referee: All right. That's enough, you two or you're both get disqualified. Alex: (To himself) No way, Alex. Don't do it. Do that once more, I'll get disqualified and out of the game for good. I gotta let it go. Kevin: Hamnersmith, let me explain some to you. If your kid pulls another stunt like that, you're both asses out of here. Mike: Hey, come on, man, I thought you wanted to win. Kevin: No, not like that. Kevin is very disgusted that Spike pulls a stunt. If he and Mike does it once more, he is out of the game for good. Without Junior and Becky what will happen next? TO BE CONTINUED... Without Junior and Becky, what they going to do now? Should they forfeited the game or carried on without Junior and Becky? What will happen next? Well, we going have to find out in the second half until next chapter of the story. Until next time, sports fan and feel free to make a comment of this chapter and previous chapter. Bye-Bye for now.

Parental description is advised. Summary: The two brothers and their sister start a rival Pee-Wee Football team. Two siblings going up against their former college football star brother, in the Pee-Wee Football Game. Synopsis: Ever since childhood, nerdy Danny O'Shea and the tomboy athletic sister Kimberly O'Shea-Granger has felt inferior to their brother, Kevin, a former college football star and currently, a car dealership. Danny runs a gas station, and Kimberly is a elementary school substitute physical education teacher while Kevin coaches the local youth football team and he is a car salesman. When Kevin's team rejects Danny's daughter, Becky, because she's a girl, and Kimberly's son, Alex, because he's too small and short. Becky and Alex convinces their parents to start a rival team, though the city can support only one. To prove himself against their brother, Danny and Kimberly begins coaching his team of misfits for a game. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. I owned Kimberly Granger, Alex Granger, Derek Martinez, The Franklin Twins (Shawn and Shane Franklin), Jessica Walker, Arnold Wheatley, Eddie Cunningham, Alicia Williams, Tommy and Blossom Valentino, and Anjali Bhrama because those are OC Characters. But not characters from the movie that I owned. With Junior out of the game, The Giants has nothing left except Alex. Spikes smiles at Becky because she's a cheerleader, but Becky glared at Spike, because she doesn't appreciate at Spike that what he did it to his friend and crush, Junior. So, Becky throws down the pom-pom, walks out and Jessica is shocked. Jessica: Hey, Icebox! Where you going? Becky: I can't do this, girlfriend. I can't just sit there and watch, because Alex and his teammates needs me. Even my dad and my Aunt Kimmy needs me more than ever. I don't to be a cheerleader anymore, because I want to kick Spike's ass as of today. Excuse me. Jessica: (Halts her and grabs her shoulder) No. No way, Icebox. You do this this, Spike and the Cowboys will kill you. This is suicide! You don't have to do this! Becky: Like it or not. I will take my chances my way. And, Jessica, I need to get on the field and prove myself at the big game. You can count on me. (Hugs Jessica) Jessica: (exhales) Okay. Just watch your back out there and, Icebox, kick Spike's ass and help your cousin, Alex for me. (They hug each other) Becky: I will. Becky goes to the locker room and put on her shoulder pads, jersey, and cleats. After that, she come out of the tunnel and she's steps into the field with the crowd cheering. While Alex helps Junior to get on the bench. Becky: Hi, Dad. Hi, Aunt Kimmy. Danny: You sure you want to do this, Becky? Becky: Yeah. Call me Icebox. Kimberly: All right. (Gives a helmet to her) Now get out there and step into the field. Becky: Thanks. Junior: Hey, Icebox, kick some butt. Becky: (Puts on her eye paint) Call me Becky. Alex: (angrily scoffs) It's nice for you to show up, Becky. We wouldn't bother needing you to be on the team and make a comeback. We still can make a comeback to even the score without you and besides, where were you I needed you? Aren't you suppose to be with the cheerleaders? Becky: Well, change of plans. And I simply changed my mind. I didn't want to see you to lose the game against the Cowboys. And on top of that, I'm sorry that I neglected you and your teammate. I'm really ready to play right now. Alex: Hey, Becky. Since I knew you came back. Let's go kick those little Cowboys asses. And I'm definitely need your help, because Spike is taking control of the game. Becky: I'm with you... Ant-Man. You can call me Icebox. (Arm wrestle handshakes with Alex) Alex: (smiles) Hey, I like it you when calling me Ant-Man. Let's go. (To Junior) And, Junior, I'm taking over as a quarterback position this time. Junior: Cool. (Thumbs up) When Jessica come to Alex, she has few words with Alex. Jessica: Hi, Alex. Go with Icebox, kick some ass and win it for me. Alex: I will. (Kisses Jessica in three seconds) I gotta go, Jessica. After Alex quick kiss with Jessica, Alex and Becky walks to the field. Mike looks shocks that girl is playing football with the cheerleader uniform and football equipment on. Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What in the blue hell is that cheerleader doing with the helmet on along with Ant-Man? Kevin: That's no cheerleader. That's my niece Becky along with my nephew Alex. And they both pissed. Now the Giants is on defense, they doing the play action on defense along with Becky and she's is doing the play. Alex: Okay, guys. You've gotta listen what Icebox got something to say and she's doing the defense play this time. Becky: Okay, tumbleweed blitz on two. I'll take care Spike and you take care the rest. (To Hanon) And, Hanon, when I tackle Spike if the ball loose, you get the ball on the floor. Hanon: Sure thing, Icebox. Derek: I'm with you, Icebox. And I knew you come back. Shawn: Yeah, where were you we needed you, Icebox? Shane: You could've came in the first half of the game, Icebox, and now Junior is out. Alex: Guys, we can explain it later. Let's play! Ready? Cowboys: Break! Spike: Keep clear, Ice Chest. Or I'll have to mess up your face. (To Alex) And you, too, Bug-Boy. You'll be next when I get through with Icebox to stomp you like a bug. Alex: Spike, Just shut up and play. Alex and Becky are putting their game face on to do the tackle. Briggs: Down, 56! Down, 56! Down, 56! Down! Set! Go! When the ball snaps, Briggs give the ball to Spike to run, and Spike is ready to tackle Becky. But Becky tackle Spike flips over like a tumbleweed and the ball loose. That's a fumble. Cliff Parson: Fumble! And what a hit by Becky O'Shea. Troy Aikman: The ball is loose. Hanon covers it up tight. That was a best hit I've ever seen. Danny: Yes! All right! That's my girl! Kimberly: That's what I'm talking about, Becky! Jessica: Go get them, Giants! Whoo! Junior: Yeah! (In pain) Ow! Spike: No! Now, The Giants are back in the offense with a turnover fumble and Spike is pissed because he cannot believe that he got tackled hard by a girl. Patterson: (Put his hand on Spike's shoulder) Let it go, man. Spike: (Shoves Patterson) Get off me! Becky is smile at Spike, because he got owned by Becky. Hanon got excited that he got the ball as well. Hanon: I got it! I got it! I got it! (laughs) The man is coming to the field out of the tunnel right by the end zone line and he's looking for his son, Johnny and his nephew and niece. Danny is looking at him and he gotta an idea. Danny: Zolteck! Come Here! Rudy: You rang? Danny: All right. Chicken little flea-flicker on 2. Take it in. Alex: All right. Chicken little flea-flicker on 2. Becky: What the hell is that? Alex: A pitch to Johnny. Johnny: A pitch to Johnny? You can't pitch to Johnny. I'm Johnny! Blossom: Don't worry, Johnny. I got you covered. Tommy: That's right, my cousin. Blossom and I got you. Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom. Alex: Rudy, he's gonna need some running room. And you know what that means. Rudy: (Crack knuckles) Gotcha. Alex: Ready? The Giants: Break! Everybody on the line of scrimmage except Johnny. Because Johnny is worried and he doesn't know what he's going to do with the play action. As a now, Alex is taking over as a quarterback for Junior. Johnny: Excuse me, guys! Guys, come on! Rudy: Excuse me. Maybe you can help me, Murph. I'm sure you remember what I had for lunch. Murphy: how the hell can we do that, Zol-Fart? Rudy: By taking a whiff of this. (farts) The Cowboys screams and breaks away with the Rudy's fart and Rudy farted them away. Alex: Green 19! Green 19! Ready? Set! Hut! Hut! Hike! When the ball snaps real fast, he give the ball to Johnny. Johnny just stand there and he still don't know what the do. Johnny: (puzzled) Now what? Becky: Just run to him. Blossom and Tommy: Johnny! It's your dad! Just run to your dad! Hurry! Johnny: Dad? (He runs) Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! (Referee whistle blows for a touchdown) Dad! Johnny just ran to his dad all the way to the end zone and he hugs his father. The Giants got a second touchdown. Johnny is happy that his father finally came here to see Johnny's football game. Not only Johnny hugs his father, Blossom and Tommy hugs their uncle as well. Cliff Parson: Touchdown! The Giants deficit is cut in half. On a brilliant piece of running by \"The Viper\" Johnny Vennaro. Johnny's Dad: Hey, kids. Blossom and Tommy: Hey there, Uncle. I thought you on business trip. Johnny's Dad: Change of plans. I just came by to see your game today and I never miss for the world. Johnny: It's so nice to see you came, Dad. I love you. Blossom and Tommy: We love you, Uncle. Johnny's Dad: I love you, too, kids. Now go out there and win it for me. I'm going to sit in the level with your Aunt and your Grandma. Johnny, Blossom, and Tommy: Okay. Johnny's father goes to the field level seat, sit with his sister (Mrs. Valentino) and his mother (Johnny, Tommy, and Blossom's Paternal Grandmother ). For the field goal, Anjali kicks the ball. \"Now for the field kick and it's good!\" The Giants has successfully made a field goal kick with the score 21 to 14. Danny, Kimberly, and Kevin cheers them on and claps, too. Kevin: All right, guys. Line up. Danny: Let me see, guys. Troy Aikman: Right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our sideline reporter, Erin Andrews. (To Erin Andrews) Erin, what do you have for us? Erin Andrews the sportscaster and sideline reporter for Fox NFL is interview question with Jessica. Erin Andrews: Thanks, Troy. I'm with Jessica Walker, The Giants Cheerleader. Jessica: Hi, Erin. I watched you talking one of the NFL Players and coaches on TV all the time and you hosting Dancing with the Stars. You were great. I'm just watch the Giants win the game. Erin Andrews: Thanks. Let me ask you this. What's your prediction for the rest of this ball game, young lady? Jessica: Well, It's kinda tough for me. I'll say the Giants are gonna win, 29 to 27. Erin Andrews: Wow! That's very interesting. How'd you come up with that guess? Jessica: (chuckles) I don't know. I just taking a wild guess to come up with my predictions, Erin. That's all. (Winks at Erin, looking on the camrea with straight face, and say hello to her parents) Hi, Mom and Dad! I'm on T.V.! Erin Andrews: (chuckles) Thanks, Jessica. (To Troy) Troy, back to you. Troy Aikman: With the score 21 to 14 and the Cowboys are still in the lead. And now the Cowboys are back on offense. Could the Giants even the score? Now the Cowboys back on offense. Briggs: Down! Set! Go! When the ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Spike to run with the ball. Shawn, Shane, Alex, Alicia, Eddie, Arnold, and Derek tackles Spike down with 4 yards. That's 2nd and 6. Referee breaks the Giants player to tell them to \"Clear it up.\" Referee: Clear it up. Let's go. All right, guys. Let's Go. Murphy: What's the matter, Four-Eyes? (Pokes Jake's goggles) Jake: Ow! Murphy: What your mama? Jake: Don't be talking about my mama! Murphy: (To Alex) What the hell you staring at, Shorty? Your girlfriend can't save you now! (growls) Alex: (jumps scare and glare at him) Don't worry about it, Murph. I ain't goin' nowhere. Mrs. Berman: Watching Jake play football has really been great for my family. Shawn and Shane's Mom: Yeah, you can say that again. In the huddle on the defense, The play is double-nickel blitz. Becky: Okay. Double-Nickel blitz on 2. Ant-Man and Jake I need you to tackle Murphy. Because Murph get the ball to run. Alex: No Problem, cuz. Jake: I'm with you. Becky: Hey, Alex. (whispers his ear) Alex: You got it. Ready? The Giants: Break! The Giants are in the line of scrimmage on defense. Alex is targeting Murphy to get hit. Now Briggs is going to give the ball to Murphy to run instead of Spike. Alex: (points at Murphy) I'm coming for you, dude. Briggs: Down! Set! Go! When the ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Murphy to run. Jake and Alex tackles Murphy down real hard with the yard loss. That's 3rd and 8. Alex: Don't ever talk Jessica Walker again and Icebox is my cousin, not my girlfriend, Murph. You remember that! Mrs. Berman: Rip their filthy hands off, Jakester! Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! Yes! Yes! (High-five to Shawn and Shane's Mom) In the 3rd down, Becky gives everyone those Alka-Seltzer acid indigestion tablets for intimidation. \"I'll give you advice and disclaimer, people. Always remember this. Warning: Alka-Seltzer gives quick relief for headache, body pains, and upset tummies, but might be hard to swallow if you do not like the taste or fizz. There are many different over the counter medications with the brand name Alka-Seltzer Original (Aspirin / Citric Acid / Sodium Bicarbonate). Each one may contain different active ingredients. Be sure to read the labels carefully to understand what kind of medicine you have and what the correct dose should be. These are side effects of Alka-Seltzer Original reported to the FDA by people taking it, and by doctors and pharmacists. Please don't try this at home.\" Arnold: Dude, what's with the white stuff? Eddie: Those are Alka-Seltzer, Arnold. Jake: I use these for acid indigestion. Eddie: So, what are we gonna use these for, man? Jake: Intimidation. Alicia: What do we gonna do with it? Shane: Put it in the mouth. I guess. Arnold: Suck in your mouth. Don't swallow and don't chew. The Giants are putting the Alka-Seltzer tablets and starting to growling. The Cowboys: Break! Greeson: (looks disgust) What the hell? With the Alka-Seltzer tablets in their mouths, The Giants growls and forming out of their mouths to look aggressive. The Cowboys are disgusted look in their faces. Murphy: (groans) That's sick. Riviera: (groans) I think I'm gonna puke. Greeson: (groans) So am I. Patterson: (groans) Me, too. Spike: Come on! Suck it up, guys! Let's go! Briggs: Down! Set! Go! As Briggs tries to throw a pass to Rivera, but The Giants tackles Briggs with quarterback sack for a yard loss with 4th and 12. Kevin is pissed off, because The Cowboys are have an off day in the second half. Kevin: What's the matter with you out there?! You're gonna play or what?! After the Cowboys punt, The Giants are on the offense and now it's their chance to even the score. Kimberly has a idea and she's calls Alex for a play. Kimberly: Alex! Come over here! Alex: Yeah, Mom! What's up?! Kimberly: Your Uncle Danny wants to speak to you. Danny: All right, Alex. Here's the play. Silver Streak to Hanon. You know what that means. Alex: Yes, sir. Danny: Go! Let me see! Alex goes back to the field and back to huddle. Alex: All right, guys. I've got the play. Silver Streak to Hanon on 2. I've gotta throw a ball to Hanon. Hanon: Are you sure? Alex: Yeah. Hanon: I don't know, man. I only caught toilet paper. I can't catch real pigskin football. Alex: Come on, Hanon. Just visualize that you can catch a toilet paper. Also visualize that I'm Junior as a quarterback. You can do it this, Hanon. I'm counting on you! Hanon: Okay. I'll try. Alex: Ready? The Giants: Break! Hanon: Oh, crud. Hanon's Dad: Come on, Rasheed. On the offense, the play action is Silver Streak to Hanon on 2. Right now there on the line of scrimmage and Alex is still positioning as quarterback. Alex: Ready! Set! Blue 42! Blue 42! Blue 42! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike! When the ball snap, Hanon is running and Alex throws a pass to Hanon. Mike: Pass! Pass! Pass! Hanon is still running, looking at the ball, visualizing that he can catch a toilet paper like Alex says and he finally caught the real pigskin football. Once he's caught the ball and runs all the way to end zone. Hanon's Dad: Yeah! That's my boy! Hanon is still running to the 20, 10, and all the way the end zone and once again the Giants got a touchdown. Cliff Parson: Touchdown! Giants! Troy Aikman: What a great play by Alex \"Ant-Man\" Granger and Rasheed \"Hot Hands\" Hanon! Hanon's Dad: Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, Rasheed! Junior: All right, Hanon! Yeah! Danny: Touchdown! Kimberly: You did it, Hanon! Kevin: (scold) What the hell is that play?! Did you call the blitz, Butz! It's the wrong defense! Butz: (complains) I didn't call the blitz. Alex: That's what I'm talking about, Hanon! (High five to Hanon) Shawn: That's what's up, bruh. (High five to Hanon) Shane: Hell yeah, homeboy! (High five to Hanon) Derek: My main man, dawg. (High five to Hanon) Becky: You finally caught the ball, dude. (High five to Hanon) After the field goal succeed, The Giants are now even the score with 21 to 21. With a two minute warning. They got two minutes left and it's do or die before the overtime. Could the Cowboys or the Giants win the game? Cliff Parson: So with two minute warning. And it is now two minutes left on the clock and the score tied 21 to 21, it looks like Mr. Mo-Mentum may be changing its address. Butz: All right, men, let's go. Looks like the Cowboys and the Giants are not taking any chance with a score tied. Either they get a touchdown to break a tied or take it to overtime. This is going to be one hell of the epic game. Right now the Cowboys are back on the offense with two minutes left and the clock is running. Briggs: Down! Set! Go! The ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Spike to make a run. Jake gets on top of Spike's back while Spike is running. Spike: Get off me! Jake: You're mine! It's a first down by the Cowboys and Spike is getting stronger than ever. They almost heading down to the end zone. Kevin: All Right. All Right. Good! Danny and Kimberly are nervous that Cowboys will get a touchdown, but Danny and Kimberly wants to win the game bad enough. Plus, they have 1:45 left on the clock. Cliff Parson: With less than a minute to play, the Cowboys are heading for that end zone. Troy Aikman: Looks like The Cowboys are going for another touchdown. Spike was not giving up and he is going all the way to the end zone. Briggs: Down! Set! Go! The ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Spike to make a run once again. Spike is running all the way to the end zone but The Giants defense takes him down. The Cowboys gets another first down and it's 1st and goal. Troy Aikman: Hammersmith is taking over the game this time and the Cowboys are in 1st and goal with 1:30 on the clock. Kevin: (laugh) I like it! I like it! Now the Cowboys are in 1st and goal with 1:30 on the clock. It's all up to Spike to make another touchdown to win the game. Could he do it? Briggs: Down! Set! Go! The ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Spike to make a run once more to make a touchdown. Spike is running to the end zone but The Giants defense tries to hold him down. One more step for Spike and The Cowboys makes a touchdown to break a tie. Could the Cowboys makes a touchdown or not. When the whistle blows, looks like the Cowboys scores again with a touchdown. Maybe it is looks like a touchdown. Let's find out. In the meantime, Danny throws a red flag to challenge the play and the referee looks at the challenge booth for a instant replay. Kevin: (worrying) I hope we get a touchdown. Danny: (worrying) Come on! Tell me it's not a touchdown. Kimberly: (worrying and trembles her hands) I don't think it's not a touchdown to me. About one minute later, the official has something to say about the play challenge decision. Referee: After reviewing the play, the ruling on the field stands. Number 32 when in the field of the endzone. It is a touchdown. Cliff Parson: It is a touchdown to the Cowboys! Troy Aikman: The Cowboys score 27 to 21. Kevin: Yes! Butz: Oh, thank god! Mike: (laughs) That's my boy. Kimberly: (frustrated) Shit! Goddamn it! Danny: I don't believe it! Come on, Ref! That was a bad call! Spike: (laughs) Nice try, ladies. But you can't stop me now. Patterson: You gonna lose, losers. Alex: Come on, guys. Let it go! We're less in the minute and we can get the ball back. All you gotta do is keep your heads up. Kevin: Stick a fork in it. They're done, baby! Whoo! With the Score 27 to 21 and the Cowboys gets a touchdown and won the play challenge appeal (challenge upheld). Looks like the Cowboys is going to win the game as well and the Giants need to figure something out before times running out in less in 1 minute on the clock. TO BE CONTINUED… At least Giants made a comeback in the second half but The Cowboys made a comeback in the fourth quarter before end of the game. Could Giants when the game before times running out and end of the game? We're out of time for now. Don't worry we will see the ending and the conclusion of the story until the final chapter. Be sure to make a comment of this chapter and previous of this story if you like to. Until next time. Later, sports fans! P.S. Erin Andrews is a guest appearance of this story. Read and Review.[Chapter 18] An \"extended and alternate version\" of the movie \"Little Giants\". The Two Brothers and Their Sister start a rival Pee-Wee Football team. This one features some scenes and segments that were not featured in contains some OC adult language, mild violence, adult content, and suggestive dialogue may not be suitable for younger viewers. Parental description is advised. Summary: The two brothers and their sister start a rival Pee-Wee Football team. Two siblings going up against their former college football star brother, in the Pee-Wee Football Game. Synopsis: Ever since childhood, nerdy Danny O'Shea and the tomboy athletic sister Kimberly O'Shea-Granger has felt inferior to their brother, Kevin, a former college football star and currently, a car dealership. Danny runs a gas station, and Kimberly is a elementary school substitute physical education teacher while Kevin coaches the local youth football team and he is a car salesman. When Kevin's team rejects Danny's daughter, Becky, because she's a girl, and Kimberly's son, Alex, because he's too small and short. Becky and Alex convinces their parents to start a rival team, though the city can support only one. To prove himself against their brother, Danny and Kimberly begins coaching his team of misfits for a game. Disclaimer: I do not own this movie. This movie belongs to Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment. I owned Kimberly Granger, Alex Granger, Derek Martinez, The Franklin Twins (Shawn and Shane Franklin), Jessica Walker, Arnold Wheatley, Eddie Cunningham, Alicia Williams, Tommy and Blossom Valentino, and Anjali Bhrama because those are OC Characters. But not characters from the movie that I owned. With one minute left on the clock, The Cowboys are going for a two-point conversion and this could be the final play of the game in the last second, but Danny and Kimberly need some suggestions... fast. Kevin: Rivera! Greeson! Come here, you two. Now, I want to two go for 38 toss. You understand? Rivera and Greeson: Yes, sir! Kevin: Let me see you two go for 38 toss. Let's go! Patty comes to the sideline and talks to Danny and Kimberly about same play that Kevin scored the winning two-point conversion at Kevin's football championship game at Sutterville. Patty: Danny, Kimmy, do you guys remember that championship game at Sutterville? The one where Kevin scored the winning the two-point conversion in closing seconds? Kimberly: Yeah, I remember. Danny: Patty, that gives me a great Idea. (To Kimberly) Kimmy, you got the defense plays. Right? Kimberly: Yeah. I gotta right here in our play book, bro. Call a time out. Danny: Time out! Cliff Parson: The Giants have called a time out, with one minute left and the Cowboys are going for a two point conversion. Troy Aikman: This is going to be one tough game here today, Cliff. The Giants are in the huddle and they got the defense play so they can stop Spike from running to the goal line to make a two-point conversion. Becky: Come on, huddle up! Alex: Listen, I understand that Spike is getting tougher. But they going for a two-point conversion. (To Becky) Becky, your job is to take Spike down so that they can't score with two points. Becky: Yes, Alex. (To The Giants) No one thought we'd make it this far, but now it's time to really dig in. they're gonna give the ball to Spike. We've gotta stop him. Right here, right now. Rudy: (complains) He's too strong. Alicia: (complains) He keeps kicking our asses. Blossom: (complains): Hell, he'll never backs down. Alex: Come on, guys. We can do it together. We all do. Becky: Ready? The Giants: Break! They break away the huddle and crowd claps and saying \"Hold that Line!\" Now the Cowboys are going for two-point conversion and The Cowboys will give the ball to Spike to get two points as well. The Giants will get an audible defense. Briggs: Down! Set! Becky: Shift! (Audibles) Kevin: (surprised) They know the play. They know the play! Briggs: Down! Go! In slow motion, when the ball snaps, Briggs gives the ball to Spike to run for the two-point conversion. Becky is targeting Spike to stop him. They going left but Rudy is going to tackle Spike, but he's turns away to right and so does Becky. Kimberly: (whispers) Go. Go. Go. Go. Spike and Becky are still running to clash. Jessica is trembling closes hands together and praying. Danny is watching and he's nervous as well. Kevin: Turn it up! Spike tries jumps to the goal, but Becky jumps tackles (slow motion stops) him almost to the goal and so the Giants pile them. Looks like Cowboys claims that the two-point conversion has success... or not. Patterson: Yes! We're in! Briggs: We got two points! Yeah! Kevin: (laughs) It's over. Kimberly: Nope. I don't think so, Kev, we stopped him. Kevin: Come on, Kim, they broke the play and he was in. Danny: No way. The Referee clears the player to make sure did Spike gets in the two point goal or not. Referee: Move it back. Everybody off the ball. Move back. (pauses) It's no good! The Cowboys has failed to to make a two-point conversion and it is no good. Thanks to the Giants, because the Giants saves the game. The score still 27-21. Could the Giants even the score again and make a two-point conversion before time runs out? It is now 50 seconds remain on the clock. Spike: (frustrated) No! No! Murphy: (frustrated) Damn it! (Kicks on the ground) Briggs: (Throws his hands with a frustration) Shit! Cliff Parson: The two-point conversion is no good. Thanks to the Giants saves the game with 50 seconds left. Jessica: Yes! Crowd: Yes! Kimberly: (imitated buzzer) Wrong answer. Better luck next time, big bro. Ha-ha! Danny: Told ya. Kevin: (Frustration growls) Time out! The Cowboys calls the time out and The Giants are going to the sidelines and figuring out the plan. Danny: You did it. You stopped him. I'm real proud of you. Kimberly: But don't get your hopes up, guys. Because there's still 50 seconds left and the Cowboys might trick you for an onside kick and get the ball back. You'll never know. Hanon: Come on, Coach. We can beat these guys. The Giants: Yeah! Junior: Put me back in, Coach. I wanna kick some butt! Alex: Junior, I think I'm done being quarterback for today. I'll put you back on your position. Junior: Thanks, Ant-Man. I'm off the injury list anyway and I feel better like 100% now. Kimberly: That's good news, Junior. I'll let you be back on the field right now. Junior: Thanks, Coach. Danny: Nubie, what kind of play do you got for this situation? Nubie: Now about \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico?\" Derek: How do we get the ball back from the onside kick? Kimberly: Good question, Derek. I gotta idea. Here's a game plan for three phases to win the game. Phase one: When it comes to onside kick, grab the ball as fast you can. Anju, you do the onside kick and psyche them out. Anjali: (Sign language) No problem, Coach. Kimberly: Phase two: Get into the play action of The Annexation of Puerto Rico and get a touchdown to tie the game. And Phase three: If you made a touchdown if necessary, fake field goal kick, double reverse it to make a run, and if the Cowboys stops you, throw the player at the field goal then you get two-point conversion and then we win. Do you understand what I'm saying? The Giants: Yes, ma'am. Kimberly: Remember... don't lose that confidence. Put your hands together (Gather hands for team hand stack) and Giants on three. One! Two! Three! The Giants: Giants! (Breaks away) The Giants are on the receiving goal with 50 seconds left and the Cowboys are kickoff with an onside kick and it's up to Anjali to kick the ball. Cliff Parson: The Giants on the receiving goal and the Cowboys are going for an onside kick with 50 seconds left. Anjali: (Sign language) Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? Shawn: (chuckles) Aw, yeah. There's my chump. Here's the onside kick. The ball must travel 10 yards, the ball is loose and Shawn grabs the football of the ground and It's Giants' ball. The Giants successfully foils the Cowboys onside kick trick. That was phase one. And now, they doing the phase two \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico\" to retaliate. By the way, the good news is... Junior is back and he's ready to play. Cliff Parson: With 30 seconds left, the Giants get set trot onto the field for what figures to be the final play of the game. Troy Aikman: The Giants are back on offense. Could the Giants make a touchdown and even the score once again? Looks like Junior Floyd is back on the field after the injury and he's ready to play. Here's the huddle. Junior: Okay. Here's phase two. The only way we can get a touchdown and even the score. Here's the play \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico.\" I'm gonna pretend that I have a ball and I'm giving it to Icebox. (To Rudy) Zolteck, you pick up the ball and run all the way to end zone. We can go all the way. Ready? The Giants: One time! Briggs: Ready? The Cowboys: Break! Spike: (To Becky) You're mine, Pom-Pom. Murphy: (To Alex) I'll kill you like a bug, Shorty! Patterson: (To Derek) I'm gonna roll you to downtown, Taco Breath! Rivera: (To Shawn) You goin' down, Animal Boy! Greeson: (To Shane) You, too, Bird Boy! I'ma eat you alive! Kevin: All right! One more play, baby! Watch the wingman. Junior: Down! Kevin: Don't let anybody behind ya! Junior: Set! Mike: Watch you back, Spike! The Giants gives angry faces, because they're look intense. And so does the Cowboys. Hanon: (growls) I'm comin' for you, boys! Junior: Go! When the ball snaps, Junior sets the ball down on the ground and touch Becky. Spike tells them to reverse. Spike: Reverse! Reverse! Rudy picks up the ball, squats down, grunts, passes gas to use his thrusters, and he runs with the ball. Kevin: She doesn't have the ball. Fumblerooski! Fumblerooski! Spikes tackles Becky, but she doesn't have the ball and Becky fools Spike. Spike: Yeah! No mercy! Becky: Psyche! No ball! Mike: Get him, Spike! Kevin: He's got the ball! Rudy is still running by he's making honking noises as he breathes heavily because he's out of breath from running. Rudy passes the ball to Jake. Jake passes the ball to Derek to get into the endzone. Derek: I got the ball! I got it! Derek's Dad: ¡Vamos! ¡Corra, Derek, Corra! Derek: I'm gonna score a touchdown! I'm gonna score a touchdown! Patterson: Oh, no, you ain't! No, you ain't, boy! Derek went all the way to the end zone and The Giants gets a touchdown with a tied 27 to 27. When the background song playing of Rico Suave by Geraldo, Derek spikes the ball like Rob Gronkowski and doing the back flip as a celebration. Cliff Parson: I don't believe it! Touchdown! Giants! Troy Aikman: The Giants are now tied 27 to 27. Once again, The Giants saves the game! \"El Blaster\" Derek Martinez went all the way! Derek's Dad: Yeah! That's my boy! My boy got a touchdown! (High-five to Shawn and Shane's Mom) Shawn: That's what I'm talking about, Derek. (High-five to Shawn and Shane's Mom) Shane: That's my man. (High-five to Shawn and Shane's Mom) Kevin (frustrated) Shit! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! What the hell kind of play is that?! Butz: (complains) I don't know, Kevin! I've never seen that play before! Kevin: Time out! Time out! Bring your asses over here, boys! Right now! The Cowboys calls the time out with 10 seconds left. They going to the sidelines and think of the plan for the final play of the game. The Giants did two phases and now they working on phase three. Danny: Okay, guys. You did the phase two like your Coach Granger told you about. Now are you ready for phase three? The Giants: Yeah! Kimberly: For phase three, the play that I give you. It's the called the \"The Quicksilver Shake.\" (To Marcus) Marcus, You do the field goal kick. (To Anjali) Anjali, you hold the ball and pull the way the ball from the kick and give the give the ball to Junior. (To Junior) Junior, you do the quarterback job, when Anjali gives the ball to you, give the ball to Becky, and go left. (To Becky) When Junior gives the ball to, you go left, and pass the ball to Alex. (To Alex) And Alex, when Becky gives the ball to you, you run to the right and go for a two-point conversion. You think you can do that, Alex? Alex: Yeah, Mom. (To The Giants) This is for you, my friends and including Jessica. (To Danny) For you, Uncle Danny. (To Becky) For you, Becky. (To Kimberly) For you, Mom. For my father, even if he's still alive and I wish he can see me playing my football game. Kimberly: (Points at the sky meaning his father is in the heavens) And I even bet you father is watching you right now. Alex: Look, guys, whenever we win this game or not. But you've gotta have faith and I'm depending on you. You know why? Because we are the Giants. The bigger we are and harder they fall. I just put your hands together. (The Giants gathers their hands for a team hand stack) All right now Giants on three. One! Two! Three! The Giants: Giants! (Breaks away) Kevin: Listen, fellas, if they give that Alex the football, I don't give a damn if you have to stab him! But do not let him get away. Do you understand me? The Cowboys: Yes, sir. Kevin: (louder) Do you understand me?! The Cowboys: (louder) Yes, sir! Kevin: Get out there! Cliff Parson: So, with 10 seconds left, the Giants are going for two-point conversion to be the final play of the game and after this, there'll be no tie here today, Troy. Troy Aikman: Yeah, this is a real gutsy call, Cliff. He'll either be a hero or a goat because of this. The Giants and The Cowboys are on the field. The Giants are in the huddle and Alex have really something to say. Alex: Okay, guys, listen up, this is a final game of the play today. I know you tired, hurt, and bleeding. I know this.
